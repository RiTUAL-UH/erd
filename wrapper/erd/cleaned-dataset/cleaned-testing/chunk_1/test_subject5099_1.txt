 I could have even made weakness potions, but time and the game were not on my side...

 lol, Ice, there is no July 32nd :D
 




 Does it close and reopen 20 minutes before?

 




 Well, tbh, if he said not to use the command, then don't use it, and don't be that guy... 




 Actually at the time I am typing this, it is 17:35. 




 It will be quite a treat seeing all the new faces we may see during and after this event! Just remember, always be respectful to the host, and never cheat! 




 Make sure you don't have ./nick enabled, that allows people to change their name and causes problems. 




 :(
 




 Be there once more, hopefully better this time!

 




 Be there again, and no babies! 




 I only had like 9 :D 




 Although I didn't win, I'll have you know I also had a power 3, and died because you didn't have more arrows! :( 




 }:) 




 I've trucked through the only matches I've played of it, but through all of them, I have learned that baby zombies need to hit less as hard and have less health. Right now they are basically small, fast zombies, and any health I lose is to them. 




 Ice, have I ever told you how much I love your games? Because I do! Although, if this is the last 1.5.2 match, I may lose my always going to meetup and dieing streak, because baby zombies. 




 Maybe Ice will host? That be awesome! :D
 




 That doesn't seem right though, it says the 21st for blackie's?
 




 mwahahahahaha 




 I'll (try to) be there! 




 Your not alone, I did too :'(
 




 Or not :( 




 :D
 




 I'll be there again! 




 I thank him too, I wonder when there will be a game without us in it, or one with Jacob in it. 




 Earlier today huh, I'll still be there though!
 




 I'll get you this time! 




 Yeah, I had similar gear as shadowlego, and 5 golden apples (+ full health) and was against the wall, but then someone attacked with what I assumed was a strength potion or a really good sword, while 3 others were   charging at me, and died in one hit. I didn't even get to heal due to as many people as there were. 




 I would recommend next time, just ban him. Don't make a long lengthy deal over it, it makes the game worse. Better luck next time! 




 To those who would want to play in these matches, I would recommend not to. The OPs were spawning mobs to get rid of particular players, and down right annoy others. I had about 20 bats spawned on me on one occasion. Other players (regardless of who they were) had creepers spawned on them. I would not recommend playing these matches until their games are fair, and tolerant. 




 I am sorry, but that seems like the, "If it doesn't impact me, then i don't care about it." or basically, you don't care about anyone but yourself. I'm sorry if I offended you, but its my opinion. 




 okay, sure i see, but how many people dont use that chat, or want to organize all their information? It gets a bit hectic to do it in chat. There are also many that arnt in that chat that want to play games, and get their games from the subreddit. Believe it or not, but a lot of people DON'T use the skype chat. 




 Not to be rude, but, where else is there? 




 Those who are trusted by the host, not all, I understand you, but there are those who would not play fairly, however, I don't see them often or at all. Many on the UBL though do play fairly. I personally want to stay out of this one, but just clearing that up. 




 I assume that he meant 22:30 UTC or 6:30 EDT because PDT is strange to use without EDT unless you live there. (Also, JOHNNY, UTC from PDT is +7) 




 You didnt put the IP in the post guy, whata doin!?
 




 Wanting me to "shut the fuck up" when i am asking a question just shows that you cant take criticism, and i was merely asking a question for why you would say something that was not a sign of good hosting. You dont have to tell me what i already know. 




 I would love to play again, your guys server was all right with 15 people, so you shouldnt have a problem with 25. (Also, I like endurance ffa's, the ones with no time limit, hint hint nudge nudge.) 




 Was fun! Started as the first one to take damage, and went on to win! 




 It didn't matter who said it, i was merely asking why it said that, when that obviously is not a sign of good hosting. Replying "shut the fuck up" also is not, and was completely uncalled for, I replied back as narrow minded as you did. I'm not the only one that had a problem with your matches, or this being the first, and I'm sure, not the last, you may want to learn to respect people before they will respect you, and don't go "you swore at me, nyanya" While it may not have been one of the most mature things I've done, you swore at me first, and I don't "bow down" to hosts, I play with them mutually, and respect them. You, I have no respect for whatsoever.  




 Sounds like wdornbach to me, his hosting is very similar.
 




 That doesn't give much context, why did he deserve to be banned?
 




 Apparently you could have logged back in, and I had asked the host (who, contrary to what it says here, was t4t4t4t4, not actually_yes) why he had not replied, and he said he was afk. I then complained that he had said "this is an impromptu, do not complain about lag and bad hosting" and i said that gave no right to not host correctly. To that, actually_yes replied with "shut the f*ck up" and i replied back as narrow minded as he did. He then banned me for: faggot. 




 He is a very clever man, but apparently not enough, you sir brought this to light, so that we know to avoid this name too, thank you.
 




 Hopefully you will do better than he did with it. :)
 




 No no, -10/10
 




 However, curious why people were still on, I logged onto the server, to see if this was still going on, it appears that wdornbach said he had lost the server, and no longer owns it, so hopefully we wont see him anymore. 




 I would have claimed that before the point of wdornbach killing people, that he was just making honest mistakes, but at the point he just went and killed people, he was being incompetent, especially because he never replied at anything ever said in chat. He is a horrible host, no because he didn't know what he was doing, but because of the things he did know what he was doing. 




 were you still in game? can you not get on either?
 




 I am not whitelisted D:
 




 I personally think you could do well, but here is some feedback:

-Don't make PvP instantaneous, turn it off until first night or second day.
-Make the spawn box bigger and within the borders, the constant teleporting was quite annoying.

I do however, like your endgame of a re-scatter, and I would appreciate you trying again :) 




 it will be interesting to see who eats their apple at the start and who doesn't ':l.  




 I get DCed too, and now its white-listed! D:  




 Skype and IGN: test_subject5099
 




 Scenario?  




 As it says feel free to apply again, may I do that here? IGN: test_subject5099

 I know I'm a bit late, but it would be awesome to play, IGN: test_subject5099 




 I have been planning to be in everyone of your FFA's, and thwarted every time! 




 Twice and your out if a great idea, and if the person has tried to alternate account their way to play, the time should be extended as if it was a totally different person (A reset, if it were.).
