 It's things like this that make me wish I'd not gone into bioengineering but rather something that involves space. 




 What about bodily waste? I assume they're minimizing that with TPN, but that has to be addressed. 




 I was really expecting that lake to be frozen and them skid across it, somehow magically upright 




 The Little Mouse, the Red Ripe Strawberry, and the Big Hungry Bear.

My brother had my parents read it so much he memorized it and then "read" it to me.  He's only 3 years older. 




 Even without owning it, can't purchase... :(

 My girlfriend wants me to wear a batman onesie in the winter to keep warm, is very emotionally stable, plays video games (the first thing she did when she got to work was tell me what the free Xbox game is this weekend) and drinks with me at kickball every week.  She's the best 




 Having a good friend who spent a year trying to find a job after getting a BS in Ag   Biosystems and then an MS in BME, probably not, go for the full PhD.  However, the BME program at my school has a habit of kicking out PhD students who are "under qualified," "problematic," or that they "just don't like" making the MS degree relatively worthless here.

On the bright side, my friend is now studying for a PhD with full funding in Barcelona, Spain.  

The best advice either of us would give you is to not do something too specific.  Do not pigeonhole yourself into a technique that is so specialized and useful in only one way that you're a grain of salt in a pile of sand looking for the other grain of salt. 




 can we call this one "pornographic Penny?" 




 I only wish I knew more people in person that understood this reference

 Guess I'm watching Scarface for the first time ever tonight 




 They should use this book instead of the sex-ed course materials.  Students would learn something.  If not about sex, then about the world around them as an engineer sees it.

Though the students may be laughing too hard by the end to pay attention if they did learn the engineering parts. 




 In my experience as a Biosystems Engineering grad student, BME students just go to grad school and focus on microbiology or optics a lot more than anything you've talked about.  If you want to do prosthetics, find a professor at a different university and consider the field that his/her appointment is in (whether it's EE, ME, BME, etc).

The two things you mention are very different, so you may want to decide on smart prosthetics (going to be more EE and ME oriented) or the medical substances (probably more BME or material science engineering).
