 I know it's stupid, but [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Licked_Hand) has changed the way I live my life (albeit in a very small way).
      

At night, my cat always props up on the side of the bed to bump his head against/lick my hand before jumping on the bed.  Ever since I became aware of this stupid legend, I have to turn on my phone's flashlight and shine it in his face before I am at ease.      

  
Not the way a 33-year-old, grown-ass man should be...but we all have our things, right?  Right?! 




 I've read a version of that before somewhere and let me tell you...I fucking hate it!  
  
Whenever my wife calls me from downstairs and I'm halfway down, that little thought pops into my head for some reason.  If I went towards her voice in the kitchen and then I heard her calling me from one of the upstairs rooms...I would probably shit myself right there. 




 There they are. 




 I think I have an idea of why it didn't work out. 




 Is your name Jake? 









 "...and I jizzed in my pants". 




 He choked himself on a chicken parm sandwich trying to imitate his idol, Peyton Manning.     
  
It's being ruled a suicide.  Insurance will not pay for that.  Sorry for your loss. 




 If I had that particular set of skills, I would have Butler pulling the Super Bowl trophy out of Sherman's chest.  
  
Sadly, I do not possess that ability and can only imagine it in my head.  It is glorious...and in HD!

 Technically true, but not when "fish   clits" is the first combination mentioned and "fish   chips" is the second. 




 Fish and Clits. Kinda like "fish and chips", but I wouldn't recommend ordering the former at a restaurant. 




 For me, I would have to say Super Troopers.  I wasn't expecting to see Farva's police baton.  
  
  
Edit: Should have taken out "the best" from the title, but I'll leave it. 




 Make it six.  I've been putting on some weight for my winter hibernation. 









 Some for a kidney transplant, some for a game pre-order, and some for being a pedophile. When you don't think about it, aren't they all really the same? 




 Your answer lies within [here](http://www.imdb.com/list/ls056287743/).

 Which way the toilet paper should roll, over or under.  I've always been an over kind of guy.

 Very cute, but I think it's time for a nail trim...don't you? 




 Two to the chest and one to the head is what I've always been taught.

 I came here from the same post...and found my brothers and sisters in arms. Subscribed as soon as I saw the title of the subreddit. Sad right? 




 "What do we pay you for?"

I'd hate to break it to them that all I do is surf Reddit all day unless someone can't turn on their monitor. Then I spring into action like a tiger...with no legs. 




 And that's where I live. South Cakalaka. 




 It's 55 until you reach a certain stretch of the highway, and then it drops to 45...and then back up to 55 once you leave that stretch.  For whatever reason, I have no idea. 




 Wow, I've never been that lucky.  Depending on the arresting officer, you could've been hauled away. 




 That first ticket would've been the property of the guy beside me, if I didn't have the stupid need to outrun everyone else on the road.
  
"Oh you want to be faster than me?  I DON'T THINK SO!" 




 Yeah, I was a little shocked that he would say something about my back window.  I obviously need to bone up on my tint laws in my area.  
  
I can see emergency lights just fine through all of my windows. 




 Just rear and side windows.  Nothing on the front. 




 I watched that loop for an uncomfortable amount of time...until I was comfortable with it. 




 Yeah. I think I would've been fine if I wasn't speeding. I've never been pulled over before just for dark windows and apparently I've been driving around with an expired tag for two months now with no issues. 




 15%.  I think the lowest it can be legally here is 25%. Not really sure. 




 ...within a ten minute window.

First one was 70 in a 45 on a highway. Got a ticket for that. In the same stop, I got a written warning about my expired tag and a verbal warning about my tinted windows. Gave him a "Thank you sir." and I was on my way home.

Second one was 83 in a 60 on the interstate. Got a verbal warning for that. Here's the kick...I also got a ticket for my expired tag and one for my tinted windows. I was contemplating on saying "Thank you sir, may I have another?", but I realized that would not end well for me.

Needless to say, my driving habits will be changing...along with my insurance premiums. 




 If he sent letters to all of the *owners*, I wonder who received it for the Packers. I'm guessing the top guy at Packers headquarters? 




 Not sure if it's just me (and I may be weird for saying this), but Cobb has really nice teeth.

 And did she give birth in a bowling alley parking lot?  If not, I'm pretty sure that having a baby at a hospital is going to cost way more than $50. 




 Damn, I don't even like letting my *wife* hold my phone.  

Any way you can wipe it or lock it down remotely? 




 We start to slightly reposition and I attempt to slide my pants into her pants, but outside her underwear.

You kinky bastard... 




 I do this exact thing with all of my cords. Keeps it nice and neat. 




 I would let Aaron Rodgers touch my beard any time he wants, no homo.....eh, maybe a little homo. 




 Kinda reminds me of this [Patton Oswald routine](http://youtu.be/RJnCHy0p6n4). 




 I ain't even mad.

 It is a very nice product, but that one overturned penny would make me want to set it on fire and send that heterogeneous piece of art straight to table HELL! 




 At first, I thought you typed "magical muffin".  My first thought was, "Wow...I really need to read comics more carefully.  I've totally missed the magical moufflet story arc." 




 Did your teacher look like [this](http://derekwinnert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/114.jpg) ? 




 Many people do not have neither air compressors nor leaf blowers nor yet vacuum cleaners, unfortunately. 




 Two Christmases ago, my parents bought me a share of the Packers.  While it is true that you really can't do anything with it...it still looks damn good all framed up and displayed. 




 One character less than the "Infinity years" result gives me the result of "88 quadrillion nonagintillion years".    
  
I'm pretty sure Nonagintillion is going to be the name of a future Star Wars villain...

 TD! 




 But isn't Hester shorter?  And they had him for a while... 




 Yeah. All that hype knots up my stomach. I also hate when all of the sportscasters pick Green Bay to win. That's an extra side of jinx, when I didn't even order any!

 Look what you did, you little jerk! 




 I will never be on a first name basis with either of my parents, by choice. I grew to love them as "mama" and "deddy", and that's how I will always address them. 




 What did the five fingers say to the face?? 




 I didn't realize that until I read your reply. Very astute observation. 




 Cut the head off... 




 Ahh, I remember that time frame. So young, so full of life, I was. Now, I'm 4,307 days into my cube life...

 If you're a guy...put it in your pants pocket, knock on her door and when she answers, say something like "I'm either happy to see you or your mail got delivered to my apartment".

If you're a girl...what package? You didn't see any package... 




 "It's Turk Andjd...and JD!"

 One tip was the bike glitch thing...which I'm a little weary of doing. I don't want to get banned from playing online or anything over a stupid glitch. Is that possible?

Another was a single player tip to invest in the companies that Lester talks about before doing the assassinations...which I haven't done any of them yet.

And another was:
1. Make two character profiles.
2. Have one be like an "off shore" bank account.
3. Whatever money you earn with your main character, put into the bank.
4. Switch to the other character and have him withdraw it all into pocket cash.
5. Switch back to the main character, and if someone kills you, the "medical bill" doesn't get taken out of your bank account. 




 TL;DR

I'm the GTA V version of Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman...without the blowjobs and ALMOST getting raped by George Costanza.  




 On Xbox, I believe it's:

Back button  Inventory  Give Cash

I could be wrong, though.  




 50 Shades of GTA... 




 That's actually the first time in my entire life that I've used that term to say "vehicle"...and it will not be staying in my vocabulary. Didn't feel right.  




 After a survival mission, I got placed into a random session. With only me and another person in this session, I felt somewhat safe to go about my business (robbing stores, shooting random NPCs, taking pictures of bikini clad women on the beach).

Out of the blue, this guy sends me a text saying that we should team up. Being the paranoid person that this game has turned me into...I accept, but have my pistol out just in case. He rumbles up to my location in a fully modded Z Type. Seeing as I barely have $9K in the bank and haven't seen that car in game anywhere before...I was impressed.

He then proceeds to friend me, let me in his car, and then takes me to his $400K apartment. I felt like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman...only, you know...if Julia Roberts was a dude. Anyway, we get to his apartment and go into the garage, where he proceeds to show me his impressive array of whips, all modded out as well. We then spend the next 10-20 minutes, standing there just talking money strategies and general gameplay tactics. He told me a bunch of things that I didn't know and even offered to give me cash, but couldn't because the option was grayed out at the time being.

At the end of our rendezvous, he says he's going to go play CoD and to hit him up later for some general GTA fun. Right before he leaves he says, "Most people with a bounty on their head wouldn't be as trusting as you were.". At that point, I just remembered that I jacked an NPCs ride before the previous survival mission and he put a $5K bounty on my head. I had totally forgotten about it.

That was the absolute coolest experience that I've had with a random person in GTA:O! This game is awesome! 




 In the first part, after sinking the bit into the wall...why does she start making kissy faces towards the drill? 




 And she's using the same spoon to stir everything.
