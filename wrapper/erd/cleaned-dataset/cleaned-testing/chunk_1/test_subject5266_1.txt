 Really? That's pretty awesome, is the story punchy and short? Thats what I like to see in an indie game, its certain;y the kind of game I want to make. 









 Enslaved? 




 You've reminded me I need to finish Skyward Sword 




 He had almost a Peanuts-style humour about him, strangely mature and insightful for such a youngling. 




 I completely forgot this character existed, seems like Tecmo Koei really love Twilight Princess. 




 already have, it's well made 




 Yes, but difficulty is usually a detriment to my experience. Let me explain. 

I like the idea of high difficulty, but it is rarely used with any great effect and instead of adding to the tone of a game, any sense of tension is deflated by the fact that while you may be vulnerable, your enemies are bullet/hit sponge demi gods.

I like the idea of getting hit once and dying, but I need my enemies to have the same vulnerability, otherwise it's an exercise in grinding and not tension. 

So instead, I often play on easy so enemies go down fast but reset to checkpoint if I get hit by a bullet, like a mentally enforced, pretend high tension difficulty mode.

It's annoying, because how hard is it to put in a difficulty mode where almost everything, including you, dies in one hit? 




 
He slaughters those guys in the bar and then uses that conspirator against King Foltest as bait for the striga.
In the games Geralt seems like he has more of a warm heart, does his character change in the books, or have the games made Geralt more sympathetic?
Don't get me wrong, the book is so far really awesome (got the audiobook), it's just interesting to compare and contrast.

 Morrowind is pretty great for that candy shop feeling. 




 I think it's fair for the devs to want to be secretive too though, it's more special if you don't understand the systems of a game when you first play it. 




 I hope this game isn't being overhyped by people on message boards. It definitely looks like a cool game, but I feel people need to temper expectations, so if it is mindblowing, it will be a nice surprise. 




 Very cool idea! Hope the world is super reactive. 




 So in this game, what are the limitations on freedom? I have never played Elite, but can you land on planets or other ships? Can you get out of your ship? Are any space sims like that?

Or is it mostly UI and flight? 




 I love listening to todd howard talk about game making. Dunno what it is. 




 https://www.youtube.com/user/PrescriptionPixel is a really cool indie game channel, I would love to know about more like this.

and

https://www.youtube.com/user/SonsOfVidya/ is two down to earth guys whose banter I find really funny and not forced. 




 I'm curious about relatively new/small gaming channels that people on /r/games think are really good or interesting.

I enjoy TB and Dodger but sometimes it's cool to see some less prominent talent on YouTube.

I'll post a couple I found down below, in the effort of fairness. Hope to see some good suggestions.

 This definitely looks interesting, I wonder if there will be a mod to change the camera in this game? I don't have anything against people enjoying isometric, but I like to see things up close generally. 




 This sounds excellent, hope to see more 60fps trailers and gameplay demos.
