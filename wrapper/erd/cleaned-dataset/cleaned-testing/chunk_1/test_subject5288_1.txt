 I drew a few drawings, and that's about it! 




 I am doing fine and I am very sleepy as it's almost 1am here :) What about you? 




 Hello! 




 Our Lord is testing your faith. Don't join the ugly shills at Cyanocorp. 




 5.5.0


Damn, you are futuristic. 




 Nope, no idea about it as I have never been there :( 









 Yes, it's similar in India! It's unbearably hot here, too. 




 It's 12am here and I turned 16 just now! Feels awesome :) 




 Naut 3 is a really good theme and it would make the sub look elegant. 









 I had been working on it since 4 hours and I made this app which doesn't do much! Feels great :) 














 Comcast= Literally Hitler


Hitler=  Approved Prophet


Therefore, Comcast is an Approved Company. 














 Just curious as many people don't seem to know about it. 









 Please be serious here. Did 5.1 manage to fix your 5.0 complaints? Because I am getting quite stellar performance on 5.1... 














 Praise DuARTe! 









 Stop this sub from being infected with Galaxy S6 shills!


**DO IT FOR DUARTE!** 









 It's 1st April! 




 Ban Ki-Earth. 









 And why is he Lord DuARTe?

* I sacrificed three goats to Lord DuARTe for this post.



* Lord DuARTe appeared in my dream and said that he would grant me one wish. I asked if I could be a MOD at Android Circle Jerk. He said YES. 









 **Best Phone :** Nexus 6

**Disclaimer to moderators:**
Slight OT is fine, but when users decide to act stupid they should be dealt with with the appropriate means - its really annoying for me when OT turns crazy. Please put the warning/ban hammer anytime any of you think there's lack of respect and/or too much unwanted OT crap - but if it doesn't meet this criteria let the OT posts alone. Thank you.

Cheers! 




 Is it a massive battery drain or a light one? 
























 Just curious as I just got my  N7 2013 and I wanted to flash a kernel. Also, as this is essentially a Snapdragon 600, is it safe to overclock it to 1.7 GHz? 






















































 ... For not updating the Steam app to material design. 









 Go to developer options and tick "Disable HW overlays". I haven't experienced any redraws after that. 
























 Google's developers took a couple of weeks off for the holidays  or from my perspective, they gave me a couple of weeks to rest  but now they're back and it's time for the app updates to resume. Naturally, it's time to breathe life back into the teardowns, and we're back with a  VERY big one. Google Search v50.2 began rolling out to users yesterday, and we've already seen quite a few HUGE adjustments and improvements. After plenty of digging, a stack of additional changes have surfaced, including one that is already live, and several more just waiting for some finishing touches including the much awaited **Project Food**. 
             **Disclaimer**: Teardowns are, by their nature, speculative and based on incomplete evidence. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. There is always a chance that details may change or plans may be cancelled prior to launch of a new feature. As with all rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced.
        
* **'Ok Google Make me a Sandwich'**
By far, this is the biggest feature Google has implemented. This is the first step to Google's ambitious 'Project Food'.  Just say the phrase "OK Google, Make me a sandwich" and lo, your sandwich will be made by your mobile! This will, according to Google, go a long way in providing free food to everyone.

* **Excitement for the future**
There are subtle hints dropped for us to see that Project Food is about to come. For example, when we saw the code, there was a line which mentioned, "OK Google, make me a burger." This probably means that Project Food will cover a variety of foods, ranging from burgers to sandwiches. 
Here is the code we observed
     string name="search_pref_header""OK Google, Make me a burger"/string
     string name="search_bluetooth_pref_title"Make a burger/string
     string name="search_headset_pref_title"BURGER BURGER!/string
     string name="search_headsets_confirmation_title"BURGER PROCESSING!/string
     string name="search_headsets_confirmation_body"YOUR BURGER IS READY TO EAT!!!!!/string


*  **Wrap-Up**
* That's about it for this teardown. It's clear Google is preparing quite a few changes for the coming months, and there's definitely something for everybody on this list. It's only January, and there's already a lot showing up in the Search app, so by the time I/O rolls around, most of this list will probably be live and we'll have a whole new set of foods to eat. I think it's going to be a good year for food junkies.

 This problem is resolved if I use a headphone. But why is this happening? 




 This didn't happen before... 














 Personally, I prefer Philz because of its interface. 




 Boxing gloves to punch the shills. 














 What can I do? Please help. 














 Do you face the same annoying launcher redraws on the GPE ROM? 




 Seeing that it did not bring any significant performance improvement, is the ART runtime insignificant? 



















 The old AOSP Messaging, or the new Google Messenger?
