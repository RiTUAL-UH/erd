  Nope. I have heard of some terrible "get 'em any way you can" anecdotes (such as barring entry onto sports teams until they take a 'special bath'), but always within the context of such practices being morally reprehensible. We also have rules for potential converts, such as not baptising those who are underage without permission from their parents.

LOL Did you guys ask Ann Frank's parents before you tried baptizing her a bunch of times? 














 A flight going from Cairo to Johannesburg was about half-way through their trip. Out of the blue, the captain made a startling announcement,

"Folks, it seems as though we are having some engine troubles. Now please remain calm, and we'll have an update in 15 minutes."

Obviously everyone is freaking out. 15 minutes go by. Captain makes another announcement.

"Ok seems as though one of our engines has failed. We are going to make a landing at the nearest airstrip. We'll give you another update in 15 minutes."

People are still freaking out. Another 15 minutes go by. Captain makes his announcement.

"It seems as though the second engine has failed and we're losing altitude quickly. We will be throwing out the luggage to lighten our load. Hopefully this helps our situation."

Utter pandaemonium in the cabin. The captain's voice hushes the people.

"It seems as though we are still quickly losing altitude. We do have emergency parachutes, but only enough for a certain amount of passengers. Now to be fair, we will call upon passengers alphabetically. If your group is not called, then you will receive a parachute. Sound good?"

The passengers begrudgingly agree.

"Now, A, will all the Africans please raise your hand."

No one moves a muscle.

"Ok... B, will all the blacks please raise your hand."

Again, no one moves.

"Fine, C, will all the Coloreds raise your hand."

Still, no body raises their hands. 

A young boy, confused, looks around, and nudges his dad.

"Dad, dad, aren't we all of those?"

"Shhhh, son, quiet, we are Zulu." 




 Yea I know that about those pokemon, but they aren't Ghost type. Or zombie ants. 




 I want 3 pokemon, I want this [ant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camponotus) to be insect, and this [fungus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis) to be ghost and grass. Now, since in nature, the fungus zombifies the ant, I want them to special evolve in to another pokemon that's like... ghost and insect. Better than Shedinja.

 Went to dog grooming school for about 600 hours of on job training. Make about 15 dollars an hour (commission, on a slow day). Essentially get to play with puppies all day. Lots of customer interaction. Make people and animals feel and look happy and healthy. Very respective of the LGBT community. Oh, and there's tips!

 When an animal is domesticated, infantilization occurs, just look at the [silver fox](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2010/09/06/mans-new-best-friend-a-forgotten-russian-experiment-in-fox-domestication/) of Russia. Floppy ears. Certain phenotypic traits are exaggerated, even if they aren't what's being sought after.

 mocking, i wouldn't use that word. from what i understand, his argument is that phylogenetic trees like these are inappropriate models for dog breeds. the 2nd one addressed some of the issues with cross breeding, but still lacked complete accuracy. i'm going to go with what you said, in that i could be wrong as well.

edit: i'm sure these trees do have some scientific, if not artistic value. that's why i posted this blog, i thought they were beautiful trees.

 Our local radio stations have been talking about this story a lot. It would lead to the loss of a lot of important habitat for many species, not just the Californian Gnatcatcher, which they claim isn't even a distinct subspecies (which get's in to the huge, what is a subspecies/species debate). Point being; is any wild land sacred in Southern California?! 









 Say that I'm 9 months sober for the first time in 9 years. 




 ^ Personally I'm part of that 9%, and 9 months sober. I really only got more in to the addiction aspect from smoking medical grade Colorado bud. I don't mean to rain on anyone's parade, as I am a huge fan of legalization. With legalization though should also come increased mental health awareness and possible drug/alcohol rehabilitation funding. Again, totally a fan of legalization, it just isn't for people with the addiction tendencies (here) or underlying mental health problems that are exacerbated by THC.

 I was in Costa Rica on a river boat tour, and our tour guide just randomly jumped out of the boat without explanation. He jumped from mangrove to mangrove, until he ran to a tree about a hundred meters away and proceeded to climb up the tree. He grabbed a branch, shimmied down, slowly made his way back to the boat. With him, was one of these [guys](http://cdn1.arkive.org/media/7C/7CD5F38B-EC21-4B40-8914-DCF40152145B/Presentation.Large/Pygmy-anteater-in-defensive-posture.jpg), and my love for the silky anteater began.
tl;dr: I saw the cutest wild animal in existence.

 well she'll grow about a hundred lbs more. she entered puberty about 15 lbs ago. 




 I like his teddy bear cut, have you guys tried a diet change or any Angel's Eyes to get rid of the drool stains? I see it all the time and usually suggest those two things. As well as your groomer using the thinning shears to cut them out, but that's just slowing down the inevitable.  









 One of my first serious boyfriends I had. He was 7 years older than me, and my parents were already not thrilled about things. (I mean neither were his... I kind of forced him out of the closet when I would sleep over at his house and wake up with him, oops). So before my dad even got around to meeting my ex, my ex boyfriend sent me a picture of his gigantic penis to my phone. My dad happened to be cleaning, stubbled upon said penis picture on my phone, and proceeded to cuss me out and argue that i break up with him immediately. Yay!

 My father is jewish? So I'm no expert on this subject by any means. Any who... little story. I went on an exchange program to Bavaria in Southern Germany, where I 'attended' [Gymnaisum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(school) for two weeks (it was sweet, we got to go to whatever class we felt like that day). Well... one day i felt like going in to a history class. I didn't realize it at first, but after a few minutes, enough of the little german I knew clicked, and I realized I had walked in to a very in detail class discussion about the holocaust. I mean, man, they talked about things I didn't even know or think about. Ideology, methodology, specific locations, names/dates/times, etc. I was startled, but grateful the truth was out there for the next generation of germans.  




 'Africa' is over [50](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa#Post-colonial_Africa) separate and unique countries.

I'd say they are very much a country moving forward on the world stage.

 You're correct, my AP European history class was quite extensive into the history and beliefs of different Christian denominations. 




 I really am thankful for Allies such as yourself in the world. You really give a lot of strength to us LGBT people. My one point, and I'm really not trying to offend you, and I know you weren't trying to either, is your use of the word, 'homosexual'. It's a bit outdated, to say the [least](http://www.glaad.org/reference/offensive). Again, thanks for that story, way cool. 




 That level of agnosticism is what I agree with. Especially if said meditation was [daily](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2008/10/relaxation.aspx) 




 I think bowing your head at the cafeteria, and having a classroom moment of silence, are two very different things. We do the Pledge of Alligiance, I think it should be followed by a minute of no conversation or noise. An opportunity for serenity. 




 If you like traffic jams, come to **Los Angeles**, and if you like insanely good Vietnamese food that isn't in a communist country, drive south to **Westminster**. Like fancy rich gay guys? Not those frilly, campy gays? Drive further south to **Laguna Beach**, you might even see a wild **sugar baby**.

 It depends on the state you live in, and whether that state has laws against owning, selling, or owning and selling them.
As a dog groomer myself, I tell my clients two places to find any animal:

 1) A Recognized and Established Breeder 

2) Shelter

Edit) Also, it depends what generation they are and how far removed they are from the serval in their blood line.

 Ok, so as a gay guy, I've actually thought about this a lot. 
As a child growing up, it's hard feeling comfortable in your own skin because everyone else around you seems so normal, and ironically being social and making close friendships with other guys, just makes you feel further alienated and alone. 
So the conversation, "I can change", "I can get cured", "This is happening for such and such reason", replay over and over again in your young, still developing brain.
Then the delusion sets in of, "Well, what if I woke up one morning, and *BAM*, I was only attracted to chicks." It's a sick fantasy I held on to, almost until I came out. 
My answer? I would of probably tried to make it national news, and get other people cured as well. Why let others suffer internally if there was a way out? If I could stop suicide, or drug and alcohol abuse, or a kid from becoming homeless or a prostitute?
Alas, now I'm out, and **proud as fuck**.
