 Yeah, a little. Like holding pennies in your mouth. 




 First, the whole Betsy Ross thing...probably false. She didn't design the flag, and certainly didn't sew it in front of the fire at the old home place. (She did sew Navy flags, and she may have had some business is manufacturing flags, but their is no evidece of this, other than anecdotal.)

The first "American" flag was probably the Continental Colours, which flew over Washington's Boston headquaters in the early years of the Revolutionary War. (This version of the flag was the first to be "recognized" as the flag of the United Colonies when on November 16, 1776, the American warship, Andrew Doria, saluted a Dutch fort in the West Indies and was saluted in return. 

The first official national flag, also known as the Stars and Stripes, was approved by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777.

After Vermont and Kentucky were admitted to the Union, two more stripes and two more stars were added to the flag. This is the "Star spangled banner" that Francis Scott Key saw that inspired him to write the song.

In 1818, after five more states had gained admittance, Congress passed legislation fixing the number of stripes at 13 and requiring that the number of stars equal the number of states.

By law, adding PR as a state will require an additional star to the US flag. [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States#Future_of_the_flag) are a few of the possible designs for a 51 star flag. (Also a good wiki article on the US flag.)


 




 No, but I once used her period for a bloody mary. (Salty, but somehow okay.) 




 You didn't let him in on the pregnancy, and you didn't want his input on your abortion...telling him now will result in either a "WTF? Who are you again?" moment, or a great deal of emotional distress. Leave it be. 




 Hmmm. I need one of these. To teach my dog how to do something. You know, something.  




 I'm glad you circled it...I was so amazed by the 500% return on penny stocks that I totally didn't notice the FRACKIN' DEMON BABY WITH FOUR EYES!! 




 New Smyrna is Volusia Co. 




 Currently ambivilent, but if I found out that any of our local ptp courses were slowing down course development, I would change my mind quicklike.

We've got a nice blend here on the East Coast of Florida...most local courses are freebies (Daytona Beach area). Inland, we've got Bill Frederick's Park...not a traditional ptp, but you have to pay to get in the park, so...it is. But in trade you get two extremely well taken care of courses, an on-site pro shop, plus the park itself is outstanding. (You talk about undesireables...BF Park does keep out the undesireables...no homeless, no school skippin' kids...not a bad trade for the five bucks or less it costs to get in!)

Nearby we also have an Executive DGC. It's true PTP, around 10 bucks if I remember, but again, you get what you pay for. This course is attached to a ball golf course, so with pay you get access to the club house, the bar, you can rent golf carts, they have a beverage cart (BEER GIRL!!!) My only complaint about that course is the lack of improvements...it's still in its "Just opened" state...but still...BEER GIRL!!!. 




 Done. I hate facebook. 




 LyinRyan kinda looks like Anthony Hopkins' younger weirder brother. 




 I'm a big talker, and very opinionated, and suffered from coming off as an aggressive prick for a while. I learned to change. Here's what I did.

-First, tone of voice. There's an in-between being loud and confident and diffident and standoffish. Use a smooth voice, dampen your inflection, ask more questions, and keep your sentences and your point short. Don't interrupt. And listen, and show that you're listening by making eye contact, and nodding where appropriate.

-Second, correcting someone is one of the hardest things to do without seeming like a total ass. I learned to tell when I needed to correct someone, and when I just wanted to. The best way to not come off as a dick when correcting people, is to stop doing it when it's just not that important.

Third, and most important, is body language. Watch what you do with your hands, don't make aggressive movements. Keep your stance open, be aware of what faces that you're making. When you can learn to control the message your body sends, it becomes easy to become an entertaining master of information and knowledge, without people hating you for being smarter than them. 




 Sister Hazel - All for you...in my ass. 




 Is that a cow, or Fozzie the Bear? 




 Let me tell you why you're not:

You're in college right now. You've picked a major, and still find time to be active in sports. Even with that dense schedule, you're maintaining a GPA of almost 3.0. You're so motivated in your physical fitness that you sometimes overextend yourself and make yourself late. Even then, you make time to get to your class, and then when your prof gives you hell for being late, you have enough pride in yourself, even in a class you don't care about, to feel bad for not meeting basic expectations. You're some combination of lucky/skilled/smart enough to have your tuition paid for, along with some living expenses. You have parents that are willing and able to help you with rooming expenses, and prideful enough to feel bad about needing their help. You have tried to lessen their financial burden by taking in roommates when you could. You are going to graduate college soon, and hope to apply to the California Teaching Credential Program. You look forward to having some time to go to work for yourself, and to spend some of your own money to further lessen the burden on your parents (who, by the way, know enough to not let you burden yourself with a student loan, which will follow you for half of forever). Anyways, long story short, you wish that you could be a little more self reliant, and wish that you could show your parents just a little bit more success in return for their investment, and recognize how lucky you are when there are so many around you that don't have it quite so well.

So. First, tell you parents thank you. Heartfelt. Let them know how much their help means to you.

Second, Step up your game just a bit. From what you've said here, you're doing better than a lot of the kids I went to college with.

Third, if you really feel bad about other students not having the tools to succeed, try some volunteer work, change what little bit of the world that you can change, and take joy in that change.

tl;dr Man the fuck up, do a good job, and call your mom. 




 Nah, the world has enough whiny bass players. 




 Practice, practice, practice.

Pick a song that you know really well on guitar. Make it easy on yourself, and go with something not hard. Four chords and a chorus, you know. And just practice it, over and over again.

The biggest thing is to train yourself to not quit when you flub. Keep going, play the whole song. Eventually, you will become accustomed to doing both at the same time, and it will become easier for you, but you will have to continue practicing, forever. 




 Run Ronnie Run is retarded funny. David Cross/Bob Odenkirk and the gang from Mr. Show. Too. Freakin'. Funny.  

Though Mandy's bit is just a cameo, but it sums up the plot of the movie fairly well.

 Greetings from the NSB!

Are you familiar with the story of the Tampa Monkey? (Monkey on the loose in the Tampa area for a couple of years now...making WC look a little silly in their attempts to catch). 

And better question...how do we learn to live with our animal neighbors? How many of these animals are actually dangerous and how many are being removed for just being a nuisance? 




 Powder up! 

I'm a Florida flinger, so I know something about hotballrash. First, keep 'em dry. Starts out of the shower...don't put your britches on wet balls. Dry 'em first.

Powder up! Especially if you're wearing drawers that rub that upper-thigh area. Bring some powder with you, and address as necessary. And remember...Talcum before it hurts, cornstarch after it's too late! And stay away from that medicinal Gold Bond shit...it's like thousands of angry ice-elves prospecting for gold on your sack. Terrible.

Drawer choice. Believe it or not, throwing down here in the heat, and the humidity, I wear board shorts...with those crazy net underwear sown in...and I never have the sackrash. Never. Might try it out, it's a little uncomfortable for the distance you'll be walking, but that shit keeps the old meat and two veg nice and airy...and airy means dry...and dry balls are happy balls. 




 There are plenty of recipes out there that you can search up, and I'm sure someone will come along and help you, but let me tell you what I do when I'm heavy a bunch of seasonal fruit.

Make flavored simple syrups. 1 cup of fruit, smashed, pitted, and peeled, 3/4 cup of sugar, 1/3 or so cup of water. Cook. Strain. Store cold. Lasts for a couple of weeks. Use it in fruit drinks, cocktails, dessert recipes. If you have a ridiculous amount, put some in ice trays, cover with plastic wrap, and store in the freezer. Use in recipes as needed.

Also, make and freeze mashed fruit. Store in icetrays as above. Throw in fruit recipes.

Happy baking! 




 Puckered-Ass-Conservative?

 




 Well, he seems pretty angry, and willing to disregard the positive aspects of the United States, but if you rewrote what he said in a way that he didn't seem like he was foaming at the mouth, a lot of what he said would ring true. We Americans, on the whole, are terribly mis- and uninformed about our country and its policies.

The major difference that I have with the poster is that I still believe that America can change...but I have to admit that I am losing hope. 




 Light is different when there is no atmosphere. Both Earth and Mars have one. The conspiracy that the moon landing was faked has been debunked enough times already.  




 I'm Mitt Romney, and I approve this message. 




 I just recently read the wiki article about EHS. I had no idea what to call what was happening in my head. I haven't had any occurances in the past couple years...only thing that I've really done different was that I improved my overall diet (I'm getting older). The last event that I had, I truly thought that I was having a stroke or something. Most times single events last less than a second real time, but are hard to judge "feel-time", but the last one went on for more than that. Very scary. 




 Have you been officially diagnosed, or is this a self-diagnosis? And how often are these "attacks" happening to you?  




 Pooping boob-dicks? Meh. But thanks for the new screen name for my next throw away. 




 I love the Gipsy Kings. Turned on to them from their cover of Hotel California featured on the Big Lebowski soundtrack.
 




 Yoga pants. Oh, and long socks. Freakin' love em. 




 Is that really that bad? I take my boy out of school on occasion...sometimes for cool sciencey things like the (RIP) shuttle launches, sometimes just to spend some time together.

Then I saw that they were from Live Oak. If that means FL, then never mind, bunch o' inbred meat necks up there. 




 I would have sworn the answer was going to be "Potato!"

 If she's well-read, she'll know the book, and approve it for you. Tell her one of your parent's recommended it. 




 Alas, Babylon.

There was a movie made of it, but it's so obscure and terrible that I think you can dodge that one.

It's got adventure. It's a captivating read. And fascinating, when taken in the context of it being written in the 1950's. (1959)

I won't ruin much of it, but it was written during the height of the cold war. Nuclear exchange was starting to be a daily concern between the US and the USSR. The story basically concerns a group of survivors, and the run up to a thermonuclear weapon exchange between two superpowers. 

This book is technically classified as a YA (young adult) fiction, but I've read and re-read this book, and it stands up to be good at my (advanced) age.

Easy read for people that don't read recreationally, and for more intelligent people, it provides an insight into the fears that Americans were feeling during the cold war. Even if you don't do the report on it, pick it up and read it. It's good.

[Here's the Wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alas,_Babylon)

 Absolutely! My SO would love one, and love feedback! In fact, I'm a terrible musician, so I know feedback really well! No, really, I want to help...PM on the way. 




 BBQ sauce, sub maple syrup for some of the brown sugar.

Glaze smoked sausages on the grill. (Works for just about any meat. Maple glazed chicken breasts are freaky good!)

Sub for honey in just about any recipe. 




 It was a long wait, say true.
 




 Yeah, of course, but there is no support for that, just acknowledgment of the power of 19. 

The bigger issue for me is the rushed feeling of the ending...that nothing was fleshed out; like King woke up one morning and said to himself "OHHH! He'll just have to go through it again! I can finally end this thing!" 




 I hear you on Mordred: The whole last half of the final book felt rushed to me. It might be the way that I read the series. In order, as they were released. Yes, I waited the decade+ to find out what happened with Blaine.

King talks about how this story insisted itself, addressing it both in the fiction, and in many speaking engagements and TV shows he's done. You can almost tell that the end of the last book is done like yanking a splinter out: you've done all the work, got everything ready, and the only thing left is the one hard yank to get the fucker out. That's what the last book feels like to me.

More specifically, and I may be in the minority here, but I hated the ending. I get it, I get it, he had the horn the second time, there's a chance for redemption, but it doesn't address *why* he has the horn this time, how many times this has happened, and along with feeling rushed, it also feels like cheating. "Ka is a wheel, motherfuckers...HA!"
 




 LPT: Go to the hospital when you get salmonella. 




 At that point, I really didn't know that others existed...lol. Also, great course. Tom Brown park in Tallahassee. Look it up on dgcoursereview.com. Only a few pics up, but such a great place to play.
 




 I played just one course for about ten of those. Moved, found more courses. Adding two more this upcoming week when I go on vacation.

 Fifteen years, five different courses, no aces. I feel your pain.

The closest I ever came was the one and only time that I ever played by myself. At the very least my wife comes with me. Short hole, trees to the right, about 141 feet. Beautiful slight S curve and bumps the chains on the way by.

The only thing that I could think was that if I did ace it, who would I tell? There was no one there. Sure, my friends would believe me, but if a disc aces in the park and there's no one there to witness it, did it really *really* happen? 




 FOH restaurant manager here.

Get an order book and pen. Use them as props when talking to people and not ordering. (Also a great place to put crib notes about daily specials, drink ingredients, prices, etc.)

Never cross your arms or put your hands in your pocket. Never itch. Never touch your face. If the book thing doesn't work for you, cross your hands behind your back.

Got trouble with eye contact? Look at the end of their nose, or their eyebrows. More comfortable for you, barely noticable for them.

Read up on body language...much of what you do tableside is being picked up subconciously by your customers. Confident servers make more money. If you can't be confident, you must learn to fake confidence.

Take care of your hands. Make sure they are clean. Pay attention to your fingernails. Don't wear flashy jewelry, or clanky bracelets. If you have to have a band-aid on, make sure it stays clean, and is either very un-noticeable, or over the top goofy (like disney characters or camo or something) to make it a conversation piece.

Smile, unless your teeth are in bad shape. In that case, grin.

Be aware of your tone when talking to customers. Assume the role of butler. Always say "Yes" never say "Ya". Don't call a group of two women "guys". 

Act like you like your job. Leave the stress in the wait station or the kitchen.

Never talk about money (outside of item prices) with a customer. Never tell them how broke you are. And never ever talk about restaurant politics to a customer.

Have fun! 




 I love the [Where's George](http://www.wheresgeorge.com/) currency tracking project...but I sorta thought I was the only one leaving creative bill notes...:( 




 Try [votesmart.org](http://votesmart.org/), also check out [this site for current congressional votes](http://congress.org/congressorg/dbq/issuesdbq/votesearch.dbq) and [this site for current Senatorial votes](http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/a_three_sections_with_teasers/votes.htm).

The short answer is that it's not made easy for us to know what they are voting for...it's almost like they don't want us to know. Also, if you can find a special interest group that shares your beliefs and interests, visit their page often for info. Single issue sites like NORML.org for marijuana legislation, or Greenpeace for eco issues, etc. Also, I like to visit sites that I don't agree with, just to see what each side is watching or pushing. Lefty sides like moveon.org, and righty sites like The Heritage Foundation, at heritage.org. 




 Wow. Welcome to American politics.

First, don't believe anything that the candidates tell you. What they are doing this election cycle is nothing more than advertising, and it is just as false and misleading as product/service advertising is.

Second, there are way more than two candidates. Don't believe people when they say that when you vote for a third party candidate that you waste your vote; politicians only care about getting *your* vote (or the vote from the larger group of people that is representational of your beliefs/needs/goals/interests)...if they see that a third party candidate is getting some traction from the voters, they will find out why, craft a deliberately thought out opinion about those matters that drove people to that third candidate, and adopt those beliefs as there own as soon as possible.

Third. Do your research. See how the candidates have voted on issues in the past. Pay attention to how often the candidates change their core message for special interest groups. Google is your friend here...stay away from campaign sites and special interest sites, and try to follow the money whenever you can. Each candidate is deep in the pocket of somebody, try and find out who.

Fourth. Don't believe that any candidate wraps themselves in the ol' red white and blue because they are a patriot...most of them are in it for the money, or for the power, at least at the national level, and most of them owe favors to someone, or ones. When you vote for a candidate, you vote in the favors that he/she owes.

Fifth. Dig deeper. Go to your supervisor of elections site, and request a sample ballot. Each election you vote on many different issues. You may have local, state, or national judges to vote for. You may have local, state, or national laws to vote for. Don't get caught with your pants down. If you don't know about an issue, or a candidate, leave it blank...don't vote for the name you like, or the party you like, just beacuse you're uninformed. Best to leave it blank if you don't know.

Sixth. Go early on election day. Don't cause trouble, stand in line, be prepared to show ID, some states require multiple ID, understand what the rules are before you go. No protesting/stumping for candidates in the polling station. Be quiet, wait your turn, be a good citizen, get your sticker, and get the hell out of the way.

Seventh. It's important enough to say again. RESEARCH. Some can be done from sites you trust. If you go to r/politics, you're going to be bombared with Obamadramarama. If you go to conservative or xtian websites, you're going get the Romneyfication. 

MOST OF ALL...(all caps because this is really it) EVERYONE WHO TRIES TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE CANDIDATE IS PROBABLY MISINFORMED, AND BELIEVES THAT THEY PERSONALLY WILL BENEFIT FRON THEIR CANDIDATE BEING ELECTED. You should just keep that in mind.

Good luck, and your vote counts, particiapation is important, and the best advice that I would give you is to participate in your *local* elections...you have more access, the issues are smaller and easier to understand, and they hit you directly at home...small town politics are still alive and well in America, and not so corrupted with special interests and massive monetary donations, and you can actually talk to your candidates, look them in the eye, and ask them what are they going to do for you, to make your life better.

Do your best, and remember...this country was founded on people who didn't stick to the rules, decided to make their own, and if we hadn't have won our Revolutionary war, would have been considered terroists as opposed to heroes, and would have been put to death for treason.

tl;dr...I love my country, I just think that we should see other people. 




 ...aaaannnndd the corn lobby is fighting hard to get HFCS relabeled as "Corn Sugar". Soon after that you can guarantee that their argument will be "Corn sugar is just another natural sugar...you don't require nutrition labels to differeniate between beet sugars and cane sugars, why should corn sugars be any different?"

AND THEY WILL WIN. 




 I'm working on a gluten-free menu for the restaurant currently. Even the suppliers don't know what's in their products. It's a freakin' nightmare.
 




 Even that may be misleading. Products that contain *any amount* of real blueberries can lable their product "Made with real blueberries". What you won't realize is that by "blueberries" they literally mean that there were two blueberries in the entire batch, and the rest is colored and flavored gelatin or TVP, or some combination of the two. 




 Whilst smoking with some friends long ago, I had hit that point where I became part of the couch. I was too lazy to lean forward for the pass, so I stuck my shoe out to the dude handing it to me from a nearby chair. I had every intention of just bringing my foot closer to my hand, but apparently decided against it.

I flicked the toe of my shoe up, and that little smoky guy, about half way burned down, did a beautiful flip or forty-two through the air, and I just stuck out my hand, and caught it (just about) perfectly between my index and middle finger.

I was able to hit it, and then I enjoyed the stunned looks on my friends faces for a second or two before I completely lost it, running around the room, high-fiving, and exclaiming "DID YOU SEE THAT SHIT! ERMAGARD! THAT WAS SO FREAKIN' EPIC!!" 




 It's still hard to tell...the two biggest tells are the trumpet shape and the color. But the shape is shared by safflower...and the certification states that at some point someone went into that factory and saw what they thought was saffron...what's being produced there now could be a mix of true saffron and safflower, or something completely different. 




 Profit above all else...but most people don't see past the pictures on the front of the box. 

I've been working with the Anaphalaxis Network on getting together some alternative menus for our guests with food allergies, and the one thing that I've learned that stands out is that if you are trying to limit or eliminate one macroingredient from your diet, it's damn near impossible. Things are misleading, mislabled, recipes change and the packaging doesn't...these people don't care about their customers, they just care about dollars...just dollars. 




 I don't regularly work with saffron, but was exposed to it in culinary school...to be honest, I don't remember the taste, other than that it had one, and it was good. What I remember most is the way that the color steeped into warm water; slowly, like tea in slow motion, but with no agitation or stirring, just yellowyorangred slowly swirling out of that little fiber. It was pretty cool. 




 I'm sure that there is someway around it that makes what they do, if not legal, then not exactly illegal.

I work in the supervisory side of food service nowadays, but I have a fascination with all things food related, specifically labeling, nutrition, and general food safety. The amount of misinformation that is allowed when it comes to food and ingredient identification should be terrifying to anyone who cares about what they eat. 




 If you can't taste your saffron, it's probably safflower. I don't know much about Costco's brands, but much of what's on the market as saffron nowadays, isn't.

Check out [this article](http://www.couriermail.com.au/lifestyle/food-wine/cooks-see-red-over-fake-saffron/story-e6frer56-1225935122839) from two years ago about the influx of fake saffron into the industry. 




 Also, all of you who just read this, said "Nyan" in your best Japanese accent to find out if this works or not.

 Just tell him....most dudes love chicks that have fantastics about Haveing their butthold play/lick. 




 Step one: Insert penis somewhere tight, preferably moist.

Step two: Thrust.

Step three: Repeat as necessary.

Watch some porn, get some ideas, don't try anything to wacky, and let her take the lead if she will. Good luck, have fun. 




 Step one: Get a camera.

Step two: Take nakey nakey pics.

Step three: Post on r/gw

Step four: Include message..."I'll be glad to let you take more..."

Step five: Get over it, and enjoy the sweet sweet karma, and the attention from your bf. 




 ...and it was terrible. Except for Cap'n Lou Albano. He exuded awesome. 




 Quite a challenge if you don't want to spend money...lol. But a few pro tips from a Floridian that doesn't run his air very much.

Your house will be coolest in the morning. Capture that cool. Block windows with heavy drapes, keeps the sun out. Pay special attention to any windows that get direct sunlight. UV film or mirror film for your windows. If you have AC that's not working at optimum, check your filters, make sure your AC can breathe. To cool down one room, block the AC vents in other rooms by shutting them off, or sealing with plastic and duct tape. Block off any doors with hanging drapes as curtains. Invest in fans. Lots of them. If there is no breeze, don't open your windows. Maximize cross winds in your home. When wind is blowing from the east, open east and west facing windows. Long term, look into a window unit to assist your ailing AC until it can be repaired/replaced. 




 Who knew?
 




 I'm a self-appointed ambassador of disc golf in my little beach town; I tell anyone and everyone about the sport, and have got dozens of people involved in the sport. (Next goal, a local course!)

Some of the things that people say when I tell them that I play disc golf crack me up.

Had an older lady the other day ask me what the club looked like...

....the one we hit the "frisbee" with. 




 ....until I'm done with him. 




 Find a better guitarist. 




 Great idea, but I see how this could possibly backfire... 




 I love this man. Every thing he does just seems to ooze awesome. I wish he was coming closer to my home, but I'm calling the number, and letting him know that I will have booze and karaoke on the day that he's closest to me.

Though I do wonder if this is some sort of Bill prank? Gonna go around town laughing at all the people throwing parties with sheets out front of their house that say Bill Murry can crash here. 




 Looks interesting. We play Innova almost exclusively, just started checking out some of the other manufacturing companies. I've already got two kind disc golfers sending out discs for us, but I'll PM my addy for you, if you want to still send it...I'm no longer in dire need, though!  




 I've been furiously clicking away at the up button, but it will only let me orange it once. Trust us, we know how awesome he is...and hopefully we can find a way to reward him! 




 We actually looked at the Surge when we shopped for her Astra...only mistake that we made was the Astra at 171g was a little heavy for her, but she loved it. (More form than arm, you know.) I'll PM my address, if you can part with that Surge, and I don't think that she's thrown any of the other ones, but if you think that it would benefit a RHBH weak arm, send it on, and gracious appreciation will be yours! 




 In the spirit of the upcoming Arbitrary Day, I seek the help of my fellow Redditors and Discers. 

My wife and I took a couple of friends out to beautiful [Tuscawilla Disc Golf Course](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/course.php?id=98) to play a friendly round with a couple of our buddies.

You ever have that game where nothing really goes right? Or left? My wife had that game. And on the signature [hole #7](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=tuscawilla+disc+golf+hole+7 hl=en biw=1024 bih=616 tbm=isch tbnid=ZRm7d6vpuf3NeM: imgrefurl=http://discjag.blogspot.com/2009/07/tuscawilla-park-in-daytona-beach-fl.html docid=YgsrrwZ1FatbeM imgurl=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9MfYZehXfoI/SnIQEZEKecI/AAAAAAAAAOU/DNvOdVLAQXo/s400/tuscawilla_hole7_basket.jpg w=400 h=300 ei=Uz38T6aeFYWO8wSms-zcBg zoom=1 iact=hc vpx=282 vpy=114 dur=5281 hovh=194 hovw=259 tx=118 ty=117 sig=111693889434370404481 page=1 tbnh=131 tbnw=175 start=0 ndsp=15 ved=1t:429,r:6,s:0,i:91) my wife put not one, but both of her drivers in the lake. A rare pink pro Beast, and her favorite Millenium Astra.

This park will recover discs, I think, but it could be awhile, months even, before they turn up in the local seller's trailer. (She does have name and number on them.) This leaves my wife without drivers to play...and we play two to three times a week. 

So here's my problem...we're so broke lately we can't even pay attention...and I just don't know if I can free up the money to replace those discs. Maybe two weeks from now, I might be able to pick something up in a DX for her, but it will be a bit before I can get her some quality plastics again.

DG is such a great way for us to get out, and our kids love the time spent in the park, and it pains me to see my wife in such foul spirits after losing her two favorite discs, and not be able to do anything about it.

So here's my begging....if any of you have an extra driver laying around, something you're tired of seeing, or just a disc that you feel needs someone who will love it, learn with it, and try to keep it out of lakes, please PM me and let me know you can help.

I would be willing to reimburse shipping, but like I said before, we're way broke and it might be a minute, but I do pay my debts, or if you're interested in trade, my wife is quite the crafty one. (Here's some [bag tags](http://www.reddit.com/tb/vosw5) that we made for our little start up club.)....maybe we could work something out in trade? 

At the very least, thanks for taking the time to listen to the lament of amateurs who can't keep their discs out of the water...lol. (I've been in that lake a time or two as well, but on the edge...she sank **both** of them in the middle.)

Happy discing! 









 Yeah...joking about the pics, it seemed a reddit-y thing to say. 

Ceiling fan? Haven't tried that one...hmmm...plans for tonight have changed. 

I'm glad you're going to talk to her. My wife is a big fan of note writing, maybe that would be a good way to handle this touchy subject.

 




 You guys are close, go talk to her. Maybe she doesn't understand that not only is that gross and weird, but possibly unhealthy and dangerous.

You also said that she admired your toy, maybe she went out and bought the exact same one?

Either way, passive aggressive isn't going to work for this. Don't just lock it up or something, talk to her.

Oh, and pics, or it didn't happen? 




 It's a long running joke, because in a way, it's true.

But not inevitable. It comes from familiarity...and the male's desire to conquer as many different women as he can. (Show me the hottest chick on the planet, and I'll show you a dude who's tired of boning her.) There is no challenge, no chase, to having sex with the woman who shares your bed for ten years, twenty years, fifty years.

You can beat it, by staying creative, and making sure that you communicate about sex with your SO. The wife and I have been looking at each other's nakey nakeyness for over a decade, and she still turns me on...because she knows how to; because she knows me.

 




 The baby was fine, believe it or not, injured, but okay. I did hear that one old man passed away from injuries, but all the reports are still saying that no one died.

This was pretty big news in my part of FL. This happened about a half hour north from us, and just two weeks before, [Another Publix got hit by a small airplane](http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/local/west-volusia/2012/04/03/plane-hits-deland-publix.html), and that one is just a half hour west of us. Bad month for grocery stores. 




 That doesn't happen here in FL. The old zombies are all out driving around. I work in a touristy area of FL, really hip with the ancient wrinkly ones. In my town, the joke (it's only half a joke) is that you just don't take to the road around 7pm.

That's when happy hour ends, and the old drunk people drive back to their condos.

It's like a Nascar race in slow motion, but with more wrecks.

And people. And Publixes. Can't forget about the Publixes. 




 Not a waiting room...that's the entrance to a Publix supermarket in Palm Coast, FL.

We're known for our old ladies here in the FLA, and this was another one, who claimed that her accelerator "got stuck" and she couldn't stop as she plowed into the front doors of the joint.

Those people were hurt, but amazing enough, no one died.

 ....and Blingo was his name-o! 




 Answer 1: Learn how to come a lot, or become comfortable with other men involved.

Answer 2: My experience is that this is true. My SO and I don't keep score, but we break even. What's important is that it is fun and comfortable. Just make sure to show her how much you enjoy making her cum. 




 Well...that makes sense.  




 Awesome. Homemade and crafty stuff is the best!

And, just to note: pleasebemysanta, pleasebemysanta, pleasebemysanta, pleasebemysanta.. 




 What's black and blue, and doesn't like anal?



The nine year old in my trunk. 









 There are eight of us playing once a week at our local course. Two of us have lots of experience and know the game well, and the rest have just been introduced to the game and are at varying skill levels, from intermediate to noob. 

We want to introduce a little cash into the game. Here's where I need help. What sort of alternate games or scoring can we introduce to keep it fair for everyone?

We already have an ace fund (It's a short course, three holes less than 150') that rolls for the month. The first Thursday of the month we play a regular stroke game, with closest to pin taking the pot. Second Thursday, we play mixed draw doubles, winning team splits pot, and third Thursday we're thinking a handicapped tourney style. Help me out with one more type of disc golf game that doesn't favor the couple of exp players?

tl;dr I like words, don't judge me. 




 Is there a way that I can set a single cell, or range of cells, to multiply an entered value by x? I'm setting up an inventory sheet for a restaurant and I want to enter cases received, but need the number shown to represent a piece count.

Example: I receiced two cases of meat which contain 32 steaks each. I want the user to be able to enter the value "2" and return the value "64" to the same cell. 



















 Not looking for Me First and The Gimme Gimmes version, I need Whitney's. I keep finding [this tab](http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/w/whitney_houston/where_do_broken_hearts_go_tab.htm) on all my go-to tab sites, but I don't even know what that means! Help me, you guys! 
























 So explain to me like I'm five, web_design. I think I have a great idea for a magazine style website. I've done my research, and I believe that there are a group of people out there that are under-represented on the internet, and I want to fill that gap.

Here's the problem.

I'm an idiot.

Not really, but I have no experience in this field, and not many people to talk to. So, before I go out into the development/hosting community with money in my hand, ready to be fleeced, I thought maybe you guys could answer some questions for me? Please?

WEB DESIGN:

I would like this website to contain articles, which I post monthly, and then archive. I would also like this website to have user generated content, like uploaded pics and videos, with commenting available. So...

* As someone with no experience in website design, is an off the shelf product like Dreamweaver or similar even something that I want to mess with?
* If not, what should I be looking for from my web designer? Is this something that an amateur could do, or am I heading for one of the bigger design firms?
* About what price range should I be expecting to pay for a design service?


WEB HOSTING:

I don't know much about this topic, and have got Google overload from trying to differentiate between all the companies out there. Obviously I want a host that is gonna give me good uptime, and they all claim to have great uptime. So...

* What's the difference from paying 9$ for one company and 23$ for another?
* When talking to the hosting company, is the website that I described above considered one site with many pages, or many sites?
* What about combo packages? I've seen several of the "brand name" companies offering design and hosting at one price? Good idea, or waste of time built specifically for suckers like me?
* Is hosting something that I should be looking for from my designer?

WEBSITE MAINTENANCE:

I want to be able to post articles on a regular basis. Probably four sections, each updated monthly. I want to allow user uploaded content and comments. Again assuming that I don't know anything about how a website works...

* Are things like posting articles, allowing uploaded content, removing comments/uploaded content, etc...something that I should fully expect to be able to do on my own, or is this something that I will have to have help in, either from my designer or host?
* What sort of other maintenance should I be expecting to do? 


ADVERTISING/REVENUE:

Sure, we all want to make money right? I'd like to have a little revenue coming in. 

* This website would be target-specific, so would something generic like Google Adsense work for this idea, or should I be contacting specific webmasters about advertising opportunities? 
* Would like to have the ability to sell items related to the website on the site (not the main focus of the project)...cart it up on the page, or link out to some Etsy or Ebay page?
* I understand that adding advertising on your site is just cutting and pasting code into your existing page...is this something that I can learn? How quickly, or how difficult for someone with little/no exp? Or is this something I have to have someone else do for me everytime I want to change ads on the site?

One more question about website registration...the name that I want is currently registered with GoDaddy, and not used. Expires in about six months. What happens after that expiration date? Is it open season on the domain name, and I can register it through my choice of domain registrys, or do I have to deal with the GoDaddy folks to try and capture that domain name?


You guys are awesome for even reading this far. I've gotten great help from Reddit in the past for all kinds of other issues, and I have no doubt that someone or ones out there can help me out a little bit. Ease my Google headache a little bit, and let me go into this sounding like I know what the hell I'm talking about.
 




 Because my original santa didn't send anything by the deadline or attempt to message me about sending it late, I was rematched. Right away I received several messages from my rematch santa, and soon after that my gift was marked as shipped. However, the same day my rematch shipped my gift, I received another gift by UPS. It was from Amazon and included a gift note saying *Merry Christmas from Reddit Secret Santa.* 

Now, I have confirmed with my rematch santa that these gifts are not from him, and the name on the gift note does not match my original santa's name (as confirmed by kickme444 through private messages). Also, my original santa hasn't marked anything as being shipped.

Santa, if you could come forward and reveal yourself that would sure help me out. I want to confirm this gift as received, however, if it isn't from my original santa, I don't want him/her getting credit for sending a gift they did not send. If it is from them, I don't want them getting banned for not sending a gift. 

It is a really great gift, and I want the sender to know that it is GREATLY appreciated! Please come forward, Santa. You can even message me privately if you want. Thanks!

 




 I learned this song in 04, and I don't remember it in D...does anybody know any different?
 














 My buddy and I are getting together a very casual acoustic duo. In addition to several originals, we're trying to get together some good two part guitar, two part vocal songs...and we just can't think of very many to check out. So, wanna help us out? We're both dudes, with a strong mid-range vocal, and decent alto vocal. Guitar skill is medium and advanced, respectively. We're willing to check anything out, and comments with youtube or tab links will be upprecciated! 









 In response to this [video post](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/lubn3/cockroach_in_your_ear_nsfl/), I responded with this:


This actually happened to me.

I was staying at a friends house, and woke up with an absolutely horrible *scrabbling* sensation in my ear. I don't remember too much about the next couple of minutes, but my friend tells me that she heard me fumbling about in the bathroom, and came in to find me standing at the sink, amongst a scattering of used qtips, a spilled bottle of hydrogen peroxide, and holding a pair of scissors.

I don't really know what I was going to do with the scissors.

The roach, a little german guy, had climbed down (or had been forced down by my mishandled ministrations) well into my ear canal, and had run into my ear drum.

I wish I could explain what that sounds like. I have been telling this story for over a decade, and I've never been able to accurately explain how *alien*; how perfectly horrible that sound is.

And it was loud.

The bug would be still for a period of time, and then would start moving, and I would fall to the ground, truly writhing on the ground.

The girl lived close to the hospital, and we walked up to the emergency room. It was about 3am at this point, and we had to go to this walk-up window, and explain what was happening before they would let us in.

As I was explaining what had happened to me, that little fucker started doing his laderhosen dance on my eardrum, and I fell to my knees at the window, cracking my chin a good one on the counter on the way down.

When I got back to my feet, the receptionist lady asked me (not kidding)...."Is it really *bugging* you that bad?"

When I find her, I will kill her.

After getting into the ER, the doc came in, and took a look in my ear with the scope thingy. He explained that they were going to have to remove it manually, with forceps.

It took two orderlies and a security guard to hold me down.

The doc stretched my earhole out with some sort of spreader, (that hurt a lot) and went in after the bug. The bug saw him coming, and didn't want anything to do with the shiny metal things coming after it, and tried to go the other way...

**Into my brain.**

The doc finally got hold of the bug, and there was this feeling of *pulling*, and the sound...this horrible *stretching* sound, though that really doesn't do it justice, as the bug fought to remain in the nice new warm home that it had found.

The doc removed the bug from my ear...

*In pieces.*

He didn't want out. At all.

Long story short (too late?), a fairly serious infection that required me to spend a bit of time in the hospital, some minor damage to my ear drum and ear canal, some long term hearing loss...I still am not at 100% in that ear, 90% maybe, but not perfect...and a whole lot of alcoholic counseling over the next couple of years to get over the whole event.

Perfect story for halloween, and every word true. I slept with earplugs for quite a few years afterward...I eventually got over it; no paranoia about bugs, though I don't like to talk about it, and haven't thought of it in years.

Thought reddit might be interested in my story; ask away.


 














 Not a lot like [Crichton's other work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton#Works), other than the fact that the book was well researched and well written, [Pirate Latitudes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Latitudes) was discovered after Crichton's death. Wanna talk about this book? 










































































 It has come to our attention that the usage of *"Cutting the cheese"* as a euphemism for passing gas has declined sharply since the mid '80's. We are now involved in a program to have this phrase revitalized in the American lexicon. To aid in this effort, we have now declared that *"Gutting the fish"* will now be used as a lexicon for the vaginal queef.

Just please note that the following phrases are *still* acceptable when referring to the vaginal queef. (This list is **not** meant to be all-inclusive.)

* Panty Blaster
* Blowfish
* Vart, Varting
* Bi-labial fricative 
* Victoria's Secret

 I responded by saying that I was gonna call mine "Inception" because it leaves you confused, and glad that it's over. 





























 It seems to me from reading all these great posts in this sub, that us CC's essentially fall into two categories...

* Those of us that are tired of the cable monopolies, and are working to find a way to watch televised entertainment on our own terms, and...

* Those of us who have recognized that TV watching is an addiction, and have used cordcutting to control this aspect of our lives.

Where do you fall, and do we deserve two different classifications of cordcutter?

 This law was tested in front of the [Supreme Court](http://supreme.justia.com/us/377/402/case.html) in June of 1964, and found to be unconstitutional. 

This law was passed shortly after the [Monkey Trial](http://law.jrank.org/pages/2855/John-Thomas-Scopes-Trial-1925-Monkey-Trial-Darrow-Deflates-Bryan.html) where evolutionism was attacked. John Scopes was found to be guilty of violations of [The Butler Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Act), though John Scopes was not fined, and the courts eventually moved to find the Butler Act unconstitutional in 1967.  




 When my Grandmother died, she willed her property to me. My father was supposed to help out by monitoring the taxes on the land, and basically screwed us by not paying any of it.

Here's the quandry I'm having. My mother in law (a paralegal and "flipper") did some legwork and tells me the property is valued at $9600. (It's 2.4 acres in an undeveloped part of Northern Florida. It has a house on it, but the house is in serious disrepair.) She tells me that the total tax burden is $5400, and that if not paid by the end of the month, it will go to auction.

She offered me this deal. She would write the check for $5400 if I would put her on the deed. When I paid off the loan, she would switch the deed back to my name. Sounded a bit shady to me, and I know she's done some shady things, but she's never done me wrong.

I asked my wife to confirm these things for me, and she got on the horn with the tax office, and is told that we must make a payment of only $655 to pay off the back property taxes (Not paid since 2002) to prevent auction. She was also told that the total value of the property was $14500. The rest of the $5400 is "special assessment taxes" for 911 and such, that haven't ever been paid on the property, but that could be paid in installments.

My questions are...

Is my MIL trying to screw me? I don't know why she would lie to me...

Am I in danger of having the tax certs sold on that property if I don't pay the total tax burden of $5400?

Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

Edits: formatting

Edit: **UPDATE**  The MIL was not trying to help us, she was trying to screw us, I guess. We told her about the $655 being the only thing that I need to pay to keep the property, and she's been freaking out...cajoling us, yelling, harassing phone calls, and screaming fights, telling us the only way is her way, even in the face of contradictory evidence. The only question now is what can I do to get the money together by the end of the month...I've got about half of it, and I'm rolling nickels to try and get the rest of it together! Wish me luck. 



















 Let's discuss. Is this a good day in history that provided closure for the Vietnam era, or was this a cowardly move to forgive men not strong enough to fight?

 I was unlucky enough to have to drive 95 north to 10 west in florida on Sunday, the day after all the bowl games here in the great state of Florida, and while driving, a couple of things occured to me.

If you have those really cool blue headlights, you are an asshole. Yes everyone can see you coming, but that's all they can see. You are blinding everyone else.
High beams are for deserted country roads with no streetlights. Just because it gets a little misty in the evening in the Florida winter, doesn't mean you have to light the way like Jeebus himself.
The left lane is known as the fast lane or hammer lane or passing lane for a reason. If you are in that lane, and people are passing you on the left, you are in the wrong fucking lane. Get over.
If you approach a group of cars that are evenly spaced out, traveling safely, with the faster cars on the left, this is not an invitation for you to fulfill your nascar fantasies by zipping in and out of traffic. Slow the hell down, and join the flow.
When it rains, slow the hell down. Especially if you are sporting crappy tires in an old beater. I'm talking to you SUV I saw fishtailing its way towards (what I thought would be) certain death, around exit 303 on I10
Try to remember that your car is several thousand pounds of steel, while you (and myself and my family) are just simply several pounds of meat. Safety has come a long way, but meat will still lose to steel at high speeds.
And just a note to the SUV with GA tags, and all the Jeebus stickers. The way you were driving on 95 north made me think that you hoped Jeebus would see you safely to your destination. Whipping in and out of lanes, no blinkers; talking on the cellophone, kids in the back. I wished you good luck as you shot by, but I have to tell you, when I saw your SUV had gone off the shoulder and rolled, and all your possessions had been strewn across the highway for the world to see, I could not help but laugh my way to my destination. I was glad to see that you and your family were apparently unhurt, so maybe Jeebus was looking out for your car, but Karma was looking out for the rest of us.

Drive safe, redditors. Wherever you're going, don't be dying to get there.

 Let's get to work on this, reddit. 




 Instead I found [this](http://www.brunching.com/alanislyrics.html) and [this](http://www.song-lyrics-generator.org.uk/). 




 Cmon locals...who's going to the St auggie or NSB Beachside show? Any one going to Bear Creek this year? 




 Get a [taste](http://www.zachdeputy.com/) here if you are not yet familiar with his island-infused, drum n bass, gospel ninja soul music! See you there! 




 
So, I'm taking the kids down to the local library today, and while we're there, the wife and I are going to cast our votes for the midterm election. As an American citizen, this is a favorite day of mine...but this year, as a Florida resident, I have been subjected to the very worst that bipartisan politics has to offer. This has been the longest run up to an election that I think I've ever had to suffer, and I haven't seen mud slung like this since the last time I saw the girls wrestling at Bottom's Up. I know nothing about the candidates, other than the fact that if they were put in the same room, Tina Turner would magically appear, and people would start chanting "Two man enter, one man leaves!"

 

For the spot of governor this year we have a democrap and a republicliar. I don't know anything positive about either (R) Rick Scott or (D) Alex Sink. But I have heard that (D) Sink has had unprocteced gay sex with her unborn fetus before going and having it aborted by an illegal alien that she promised amnesty to. And I heard that (R) Scott was all for invading Mexico instead of putting up a wall, and all he needed to know about government he learned from the bible and 1984 by George Orwell. There were also some other people running who don't have enough money to be important.

 

The Senate race is not much better. The Derpocrats are offering us Kendrick "Aren't we progressive by nominating a black guy" Meek, and the Retardicans are offering us Marco "Cuba wasn't that bad" Rubio. These two have been overshadowed by the fight for Governator. After all the money that they spent, and all the ads that they both have run, the only thing that I know about these two with any certainty, is what they look like. They are as insubstantial as ghosts, only louder. Then you got Independent Charlie "Jesus H." Crist. This guy has been accused of flip flopping more than John Kerry ever was. Crist was a party Retardican, until the party line required him to set fire to the Gulf of Mexico so that rich fat white men could squeeze a little more blood out of the citizen turnips that they "represent" (They keep saying this word, but I do not think it means what they think it means...) Crist broke the party line, the Party pulled support, so Crist dumped the party so that he could represent the People's Will of Florida....and this apparently is a bad thing. Having morals will not be rewarded, there Charlie. There are also some othere people who did not have enough money to matter.

 

There are a few amendments to vote on, but none of them are Prop 19, so no one has seemed interested in them. In Florida we have amendments 5   6, which supposedly are supposed to bring some common sense law to congressional redistricting. The Democrat commercials that I've seen on this seem to explain what the amendment purports to do, and how it will affect Floridians. The Republican commercials that I've seen about this simply point out that the ACLU is run by the devil, and shows pictures of Obama and Pelosi, with their heads bent together, apparently continuing to plot for world domination.

 

And my other favorite...A non-binding referundum. I qoute:

"In order to to stop the uncontrolled growth of our National Debt and prevent excessive borrowing by the Federal Government, which threatens our economy and national security, should the United States Constitution be amended to require a balanced budget without raising taxes?"

 

Wow. Sounds good. Our family runs a balanced budget, so the government ought to be able to as well, right? But I also spend a lot of time and energy increasing the amount of income that I recieve. You do know how the government gets its income right? Taxes! I'm all for a smaller government, and I don't think that we need to be paying for illegal aliens to get health care, and for the state of Missouri to do a multi million dollar study to find out why crisp pickles are better than soggy ones, but I don't think that we need to have a constitutional amendment that prevents our government from recieving additional income. (I'm a fan of the fair tax, but no one's letting my vote on that, yet) I know that it's possible to have a balanced budget without borrowing (Clinton did it) but this feels like the same thing that is wrong with america at large. We want what we want, but no one wants to pay for it.

 


Ending on an important note...please get up and turn off your TV, do the research on-line about the candidates that you care about, and learn about the issues you get to vote on, and go on down to your polling place and cast your vote. Please. It's your job. It's your duty. And many Americans in the past had to die to get you that right. White folks had to fight in the beginning for their right to vote, and then change the law so that they didn't have to own property to be able to vote. You black folks couldn't vote until 1870, and in most parts of the country they made it so difficult for you that most of you couldn't vote until the Civil Rights era of the '60s and '70s. And you girlys out there...do you remember when you learned about the suffergettes? You've only been voting since 1920. Don't do your ancestors a disservice by forgetting the lessons that they paid so dearly for. See you in line, I'm gonna go vote. Whether it's for a douchebag or a shit sandwich is yet to be determined.

So, I'm taking the kids down to the local library today, and while we're there, the wife and I are going to cast our votes for the midterm election. As an American citizen, this is a favorite day of mine...but this year, as a Florida resident, I have been subjected to the very worst that bipartisan politics has to offer. This has been the longest run up to an election that I think I've ever had to suffer, and I haven't seen mud slung like this since the last time I saw the girls wrestling at Bottom's Up. I know nothing about the candidates, other than the fact that if they were put in the same room, Tina Turner would magically appear, and people would start chanting "Two man enter, one man leaves!"

 

For the spot of governor this year we have a democrap and a republicliar. I don't know anything positive about either (R) Rick Scott or (D) Alex Sink. But I have heard that (D) Sink has had unprocteced gay sex with her unborn fetus before going and having it aborted by an illegal alien that she promised amnesty to. And I heard that (R) Scott was all for invading Mexico instead of putting up a wall, and all he needed to know about government he learned from the bible and 1984 by George Orwell. There were also some other people running who don't have enough money to be important.

 

The Senate race is not much better. The Derpocrats are offering us Kendrick "Aren't we progressive by nominating a black guy" Meek, and the Retardicans are offering us Marco "Cuba wasn't that bad" Rubio. These two have been overshadowed by the fight for Governator. After all the money that they spent, and all the ads that they both have run, the only thing that I know about these two with any certainty, is what they look like. They are as insubstantial as ghosts, only louder. Then you got Independent Charlie "Jesus H." Crist. This guy has been accused of flip flopping more than John Kerry ever was. Crist was a party Retardican, until the party line required him to set fire to the Gulf of Mexico so that rich fat white men could squeeze a little more blood out of the citizen turnips that they "represent" (They keep saying this word, but I do not think it means what they think it means...) Crist broke the party line, the Party pulled support, so Crist dumped the party so that he could represent the People's Will of Florida....and this apparently is a bad thing. Having morals will not be rewarded, there Charlie. There are also some othere people who did not have enough money to matter.

 

There are a few amendments to vote on, but none of them are Prop 19, so no one has seemed interested in them. In Florida we have amendments 5   6, which supposedly are supposed to bring some common sense law to congressional redistricting. The Democrat commercials that I've seen on this seem to explain what the amendment purports to do, and how it will affect Floridians. The Republican commercials that I've seen about this simply point out that the ACLU is run by the devil, and shows pictures of Obama and Pelosi, with their heads bent together, apparently continuing to plot for world domination.

 

And my other favorite...A non-binding referundum. I qoute:

"In order to to stop the uncontrolled growth of our National Debt and prevent excessive borrowing by the Federal Government, which threatens our economy and national security, should the United States Constitution be amended to require a balanced budget without raising taxes?"

 

Wow. Sounds good. Our family runs a balanced budget, so the government ought to be able to as well, right? But I also spend a lot of time and energy increasing the amount of income that I recieve. You do know how the government gets its income right? Taxes! I'm all for a smaller government, and I don't think that we need to be paying for illegal aliens to get health care, and for the state of Missouri to do a multi million dollar study to find out why crisp pickles are better than soggy ones, but I don't think that we need to have a constitutional amendment that prevents our government from recieving additional income. (I'm a fan of the fair tax, but no one's letting my vote on that, yet) I know that it's possible to have a balanced budget without borrowing (Clinton did it) but this feels like the same thing that is wrong with america at large. We want what we want, but no one wants to pay for it.

 


Ending on an important note...please get up and turn off your TV, do the research on-line about the candidates that you care about, and learn about the issues you get to vote on, and go on down to your polling place and cast your vote. Please. It's your job. It's your duty. And many Americans in the past had to die to get you that right. White folks had to fight in the beginning for their right to vote, and then change the law so that they didn't have to own property to be able to vote. You black folks couldn't vote until 1870, and in most parts of the country they made it so difficult for you that most of you couldn't vote until the Civil Rights era of the '60s and '70s. And you girlys out there...do you remember when you learned about the suffergettes? You've only been voting since 1920. Don't do your ancestors a disservice by forgetting the lessons that they paid so dearly for. See you in line, I'm gonna go vote.

 I know there are locals in this tourist heavy town. Let's not be overshadowed by r/orlando anymore! 









 I am contemplating leaving my steady job with the goal of total entertainment domination of the area in which I live. Karaoke, event DJ, live sound production/recording, and gigging as a one man band...any tips or warnings from those of you making a living in the industry? 









 Condensation will collect on a surface when it is colder than the air around it, correct? Trying to build a small(ish) collector with an output of around 1/2 oz per hour. Could I use a metal bowl shape to heat up a volume of air using solar heat so that condensation would collect on a small metal plate that is shaded by the bowl? Any ideas/help?  




 I'll post for a bit tonight, and then tomorrow afternoon when I come out of my anesthetic fog... 




 I've had this broke-ass tooth for six years, and I'm finally manning up and getting it taken care of. I'll answer questions about my monday-morning-molar-meltdown tonight, and then Monday afternoon when I am able to. 














 [Here's](http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2010/07/28/a-poignant-way-to-mark-911/) the story from The Independent. 

The Dove World Outreach Center? Really? What sort of outreach is this? 

Here's the [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Burn-A-Koran-Day/134718123226530?v=wall) of this wonderful event. My wife and I were thinking about going....anyone know where we can get a whole lot of bibles for really cheap? (Any other FL Redditors thinking about going?)

If you don't go, you could still drop a comment at the anti quran burning [facebook page here](http://www.facebook.com/pages/In-Protest-of-International-Burn-a-Koran-Day/105895039464821?ref=ts)

See ya there! 









 Happy 100, [Jacques Cousteau!](http://www.cousteau.org/) Anyone want to guess what Jacques would have had to say about our Gulf of Mexico? 









 Heard he had a different stroke. 




 Or do I need a new hobby?

 I reworked this recording today. It's an [old song](http://soundcloud.com/smokin-joe-ledden/circles), but I like the vocals. 
 




 My wife and I have a very good mexican friend who lives a few hours away (in the US). We don't get to see or talk to them often. When we decided that we were getting married, we called him and told him that we needed an address to send him an invitation. His response was that he was "not aware that he needed one" and then contact has broken off. Have my wife and I mistakenly broken some sort of taboo? Never had any issue like this with him before, and he didn't come to the wedding, invitation or not. 

Can you help? And, if we have done something taboo, how do we apologize?

(edit:grammar) 




 I record in Cubase3...have no problem converting cubase's .cpr files into .wav files. Can't find a converter to take .wav into .mp3 without adding pop/clicks or just generally sounding like hell...any ideas? 









 Where are some good sites for hosting/posting music? How do I get people listening from here. I have only a small library of original music right now, but I am recording often, and I don't know what to do with all my hard work. Any suggestions?
