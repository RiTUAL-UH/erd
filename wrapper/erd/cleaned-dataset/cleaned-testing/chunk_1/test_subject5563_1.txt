 For me it's AC2/Brotherhood and Revelations. AC3 had some good tunes, however for me AC4 as largely unforgettable as I wasn't big into the sea shanties.  




 Dat scream....scared the living fuck out of me. 




 Executor: 1.1 billion credits then gets taken out by a lowly A-class starfighter, classic. 




 Is this the first time she has been topless in a role? 




 It was also titled [Star Wars Underworld](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Underworld) it seemed to have a pretty awesome premise. 

"Basically, it is like 'The Godfather'; its the Empire slowly building up its power base around the galaxy, what happens in Coruscant, which is the major capital, and its [about] a group of underground bosses who live there and control drugs, prostitution..."
Rick McCallum

Personally I think it would be an amazing on HBO if they put in a similar 10 episode season like they do with Game of Thrones with a similar budget as well, however the chances of that happening are nil since Disney own the ABC network which they would most likely produce it on. 




 Just curious OP but what exactly did you find a little offensive in this? 




 Look i'm sure that the production of ANY tv show is not "lazy" but don't you think in Australia  that all the free to air networks in Australia are over-saturated with reality tv shows? It seems like every network is just chasing after each other when one network has a successful reality show. Just my 2 cents as tv viewer. 




 Is there a guide for what kind of paper should be used when printing video game covers? 




 I actually think this would fit Ridley Scott perfectly, combined with a good screenplay of course *cough Prometheius cough*. If the film follows the first game and is set in the 12 century I feel that he could absolutely nail the look and feel of the setting as well as the sci fi elements. For reference I think people should check out the directors cut for Kingdom of Heaven as it is set roughly in the same time period as AC1 and gives a good vision for what he could achieve. 




 Recognise that yellow anywhere. 




 Serious question but how are you actually supposed to see out of the back? Does it have a series of cameras or are you just expected to never drive it on public roads and only take it to the track? 




 OP can you tell me what the pads you have under your wrists are called? 




 After coming from Titanfall to BF4, I have found myself getting caught on everything. 




 If they do it I hope they make it as unique as the [Tron Legacy Disney Castle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBN-Iolxa1o) was! 




 That's CNN for you. 




 Cheers mate much appreciated! 




 Any chance you could upload that tune somewhere for me to have a listen? 




 I was originally like you and asked myself whether the show would be too childish etc. Then I decided to watch it from season 1 to 6 and honestly it is fantastic. Sure there are a few dud episodes and some story arcs that appeal more to children than adults but the underlying theme of darkness is present throughout the series and man does it get dark especially in the latter seasons. Seriously do yourself a favour and watch it. 




 Looks kind of like a gigantic space jockey from Prometheus or Alien. 




 I have the same kit as well it's currently sitting on my shelf! Unfortunately though the stickers have been flaking off for some time now since I neglected it when I was young and I dont know if I would be able to get replacements :( 




 Apps are basically the same price as their US counterparts. I remember originally IOS apps being more expensive. A 99c app on the US store would cost $1.60, however in the last few years apps have gone down to 99c on the Aus store.  




 I just really hope they overhaul the entire free running system it just felt so dated and clumsy in AC4. It needs to feel and look more fluid as well as have a better sense of momentum when you are running. Other than that the other main improvements need to come in the form of A.I hopefully now that's only next gen they can improve the A.I due to higher memory.  




 I think of the ratings as more of a guideline. I was fortunate that my mum or dad didn't care about what I played too much and was able to get away with some pretty gnarly games at a young age. For example I got GTA 3 on PS2 when I was in Year 4 of primary school. I look back on it know as my parents being a bit naive but also as a sign of trust in that they raised me correctly and made me work for these games. I'm not saying that your mum is completely wrong in not getting you the game but I think showing that you can handle mature themes, ideas and concepts which transcend the idea of these artificial ratings, it will go along way with your mum. My 2 cents though I'm sure many people may disagree with me. 




 I actually quite enjoyed the theatrical version of the film when I saw it, even if I didn't quite understand the plot at times it kept me intrigued. I was curious if anyone has seen the directors cut and if that is the definitive version of the film? 




 Got 7 noms that year and didn't win a single one. 




 There was a lot of nice detail in this clip from the coffee swirling around in the cups to that guy lighting a cigarette almost had a very slight inglorious basterds feel to it. Of course the fact that they were speaking German was also a very nice touch. 




 He kind of looks like a character I would create in Oblivion or Skyrim. 




 It seems he went full retard.  




  Sony have already said that the price of the PS4 was not finalized until E3, and that they were prepared to sell it for less than they are in order to undercut the Xbox One, which was their ultimate goal from the start. When Microsoft announced their higher-than-expected pricing, Sony execs breathed a sigh of relief. This was all discussed numerous times in a wide variety of interviews with several Sony execs. The prices were not known to anyone outside of these two companies until the announcements were made.
 

I don't think Respawn chose to make it for the Xbox One as many developers with Respawn have stated that they are upset that PS4 owners won't be able to experience the game since they want it to reach as many households as possible. It was a very corporate decision to keep it to the Xbox One. 
 




 Even then would that cover the long term sales of lost game/dlc sales for the PS4? 




 Sorry but even MS will never pay a stupidly high amount for Titanfall 2. The only reason Titanfall 1 was a console exclusive was because a former EA executive thought the Xbox One would dominate this gen. EA are pretty much kicking themselves over this though since the PS4 now has the higher install base. So essentially MS would have to pay the equivalent of what EA are losing in potential PS4 sales and that would simply be too high for MS to pay. MS would most likely want to put that money into their own IP's such as Gears or Halo where they know they will get a substantial profit instead of splitting up the portion of these profits with another company like EA if they made Titanfall 2 




 While this wasn't the first game that got me into gaming, it was the first one that got me into RPG's. 




 Happening to me as well, so fucking annoying. When you want to watch a simple youtube video it fucking greys the screen asking if you want to use your G+ account, seriously G+ can fuck right off.  




 Does some of the score sound like it was taken from The Social Network film? 




 Looks like a Victoria plate in the pic unfortunately.  




 It didn't help that they showed all the episodes out of order AND kept having multiple breaks between episodes. 




 With that topic I would like to point people to the [Angels and Demons Teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7YrwBYezWM) which I thought was excellent.  




 Is it possible to get this as a 1080p wallpaper for my desktop? 




 I have heard that the majority of the film was cut down and it's easy to tell after viewing the film so I was wondering if anyone here had managed to see the full length version at any press screenings etc? If so did it hold up to the original film? 




 What about [The E3 2009 AC2 Walkthrough](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pIw4M4_ufI) this opening section was not even in the game and it looked really nice as well:/ 




 Which game in the series did you feel have the best soundtrack? In my opinion it's easily AC2 and perhaps Brotherhood. Jesper Kyd nailed the atmosphere and mood of the game in his soundtrack!  




 Otto is Otto backwards, whoa. 




 Yeah it was such a load of bullshit. Was there any specific reason as to why they just didn't use PSN? 




 Creating a Konami ID for the beta and then updating the game. Good times. 




 Man me too I actually put a decent time into the game but I sucked massively also I don't remember how the ranking worked in the game but was it just me or did it take a million years to actually rank up the skills in the game? 




 I enjoyed the movie for what it was however I did feel they overdid it on the slow mo. I also felt that the computer generated blood took me out of it a bit.  




 He has the look but I don't think he would be able to pull off the character though. I'd like to be proven otherwise though! 




 If this does happen I guarantee the ending will not test well and they will change it.  




 This is gonna be a weird one but for me it was Gattaca. It hit me hard for some reason because when growing up my brother was pretty much better at everything compared to me so the scenes of of Ethan Hawke's character striving to be better really hit home for me.  









 Do the lights on the case not become distracting when playing the game? 




 I'm not entirely surprised by this actually I flew back from Hong Kong to Sydney via Qantas airlines and the guy infront asked the steward if he could smoke a cigarette (this being after the countless reminders saying you can't). She gave a stern no and looked confused herself.  




 So basically a G-Diffuser is the only thing keeping the plane alive. 




 Odd I have never the old 7 series without the navigation unit inside.  




 Seems like they had kind of sobered up for the most part before burning the house down.  




 For those who don't know the original [Alien trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjLamj-b0I8) is what the Prometheus trailer was based off.  




 I was in the exact same situation mate a few days ago. In my opinion its best if you don't lock onto the dragon and get some distance. It basically has a tell for each move its gonna do when it lies down flat it basically means its gonna charge and when it does you can easily manouver around it and get a few hits in on the tail BUT you have to be cautious because you need your stamina to gain distance again when it starts bend over again. It has a move in which it will vomit up all this acid on the ground which can spread in a rather large radius but you as long as you are far away from him you can avoid it although if you get hit it will reduce weapon durability. You can tell when he's gonna do the acid move when he starts do this regurgitating animation from what I can remember. 

Basically just don't lock onto him and keep a lot of distance and monitor how he tries to attack you. It takes a while to get his HP down when you're only attacking his back side but it's the safest way imo.  




 Can the door operate individually to the roof? 




 I think the [Matrix Opening](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIXNpePYzZU) for me has the best WB logo. Just the music, sound effects and green colouring takes me back.  




 I wwebsite as on the internet when you were a sperm in your daddys balls and before it was the internet 




 I'm glad that I am not the only one who picked this up! I actually quite like this angle gave a nice soft look to that specific scene. 




 To be fair you would be surprised as to what the human body can endure in certain circumstances. It's not out of the complete realm of possibility for Shelby to have had a pulse but be completely unconscious.  




 In Australia it's subtitled as Rise of Electro. The trailers and posters they have in the cinema both have that subtitle.  




 True that it does seem like a pretty revolutionary car, curious to see if they would make an even faster variant of it, perhaps an i8M or Mi8 if that doesn't sound too silly haha. 




 My bad completely forgot about that one!
 




 Fantastic tune, cheers mate! 




 Did this episode remind anyone of The Last of Us? The raiders in the house acted very much like the hunters you face in the game, and when Rick takes down the guy in the bathroom it looked very reminiscent of something you would do in the game.   




 Now I understand that supercars are a very expensive investment which sees very little return, however the idea of BMW making a supercar which has their performance pedigree gets me wet to say the least. Perhaps something like [this concept](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18xpnwxs9ixyzjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg) 




 
Paris: "Yeah they like totally broke into my house".

Producers: "Thanks Paris we got what we needed to make the film now". 




 So does Mclaren actually not have a title sponsor for this year? I think the car looks fantastic without a bright contrasting sponsor plastered all over it like last year.  




 Also right hand drive.  




 Jiffy! 1:44-1:47 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn3PQJ9PHLY 




 I just love the fact that they actually use the phones properly in the show. They don't super impose some stupid interface that makes silly sounds over the phone to get their point across. Instead you get the real deal. I especially love the graphics they use on screen when the characters text each other.  




 I've been thinking his name was Beechum the whole time... I am not a smart man. 




 Apologies if this has been asked before but why didn't Michone take one of the vehicles left over after the Governors raid? She walked past a bright red Jeep that was on the grass in the prison I am assuming worked since it would have been driven there by one of the Governors people.  









 Ages ago when I was really young we went shopping so my older brother could get some new shoes, his eyes landed on a pair of Diesel brand shoes and my dad just says. "Why don't you buy unleaded?" 









 Hey guys so basically Netflix seems to lag in the browser mode when it hits HD resolution. It lags on both Firefox and Chrome bear in mind that I am using it through media hint on both browsers since it's not available in Australia. Is there anyway to fix this and also is there anyway to try it on Internet Explorer? 




 Hey guys so i'm travelling from Sydney, Australia to Hong Kong for four days, just for a bit of a break since I am finished with university and was wondering what are some fun things to check out in the little time I have besides shopping of course :) So any bars etc people recommend? 

Cheers! 



















 So I felt that while season 2 was great it came a bit too early. Season 2 felt like series finale material. This is how I would have arranged the seasons. 

Start off obviously with Season 1Season 3Season 5Season 4Season 6Season 7Season 2.

Now this is how I felt the order of the show could have gone assuming that certain characters did not die. Obviously Season 8 does not exist in this and you may be able to exclude season 5 from this order as well and pretend it never happened.  



















 I understand the press get to see the game-play etc behind closed doors and then they get to write about it, however to my knowledge have we ever seen game-play videos from a Rockstar game before its release? 









 When this film came out I was about 11 years old so obviously I wasn't really clued in what people thought about the film. I know this though that when I did see it in the cinemas with my parents, I cried and it is still the only live action film which had genuinely brought a tear to my eye from what I can remember. I obviously didn't get the underlying themes or motifs that the film conveyed at the time but after watching it recently at the ripe age of 21, I gotta say I am quite surprised at how many people dislike it, I didn't really notice how divisive the film was at its release. 

So what how do you fine people feel about A.I? Is it a masterpiece or is it one of Spielberg's missteps? 














 Basically are there any hidden gems around the harbour that not many people know about, maybe some rooftops etc to watch the NYE Fireworks? 

edit: unpopulated places to watch NYE Fireworks? 









 There were rumours that the film was going to be re-released in a limited run to remind the academy that this film exists, so hopefully it happens as I feel that it was really the surprise hit of the year for me, in my opinion.  




 Hi guys now first and foremost I am not a heavy drinker at all, I am only 21 and studying at university so I only drink heavy on occasion to celebrate or party etc, now I am not looking to make fun or offend anyone here but my main question is why do people turn to alcohol? The reason for this is alcohol in itself tastes pretty nasty in my opinion. As in spirits like Vodka, Whiskey and other hard liquors. Do you guys mix alcohol or just drink beer etc? This is purely out of curiosity I am not looking to berate or offend anyone here. I sincerely hope that those of you who do indeed suffer from an addiction to alcohol that you overcome it!

Edited for grammar. 




 Here is the [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTGC5Ot23KU) for those who are interested or need a refresher. Now this film was pretty much universally panned by critics and viewers alike, I just watched it last night and I am not so sure whether it deserves all the hate it got, granted it is by no means a fantastic film although it does have fantastic cinematography.  




 So I downloaded Lucid Rounds on the play store for my GNEX and was wondering how to use it, I open the app and it asks to download a zip file however nothing really happens after that. Once the download finishes I click the download in the notification tray and then nothing happens. Do I need a program to unzip it properly? 




 Do you guys feel that MGS2 is one of the more relevant games for our society/time?. With the underlying themes of digital censorship and the control of information, I feel that this game is even more relevant now than it was back when it released. 
 




 So with all the cool themes I am seeing in the /androidthemes subreddit, I was curious as to how you install these themes, sorry for being a complete retard, the most complex thing I have done to my phone is flashing the firmware to Yakju to get OTA updates.  




 Watched a horror film when I was really young, sometime in the mid 90s (the movie may have been reeleased prior) and it involved this female bride going turning into a monster and killing people. The only scene I vaguely remember was that of the bride walking along the side-walk and she comes across this kid playing a violin and then proceeds to kill him or injure him. Sorry that I cannot remember much of the film at all. It would be of great help to find the title of this film. Thanks.  









 Thought I would raise the question of films that were critically panned but had great posters. I'll start with Max Payne 

http://www.filmgrenade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/max_payne_large_poster_2.jpg 




 Today I found a peanut butter that had expired at least 4 years ago, it had already been opened, suffice to say the contents were pretty gnarly.

 So here is my pick for music that I play in EVE Online when I get the chance to play. This song just makes me feel like exploring infinitely which in turn coincides with what I love to do in EVE :D!
