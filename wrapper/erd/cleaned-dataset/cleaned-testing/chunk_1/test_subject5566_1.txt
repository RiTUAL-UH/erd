 Very cool site 




 Hi, I created the website myself using 'Brackets Sprint' - it's a coding text editor. There are a lot of pre-built templates out there though - if you do a quick google you will be able to find a good one. 




 Thanks for your feedback - I will definitely make the period change. 




 This is very cool - particularly the 'friend network' towards the bottom of the page once you sign in with facebook
