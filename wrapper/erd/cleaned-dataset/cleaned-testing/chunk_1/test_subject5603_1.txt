 I will say this for Rand Paul, he's the most entertainingly unpredictable figure in politics today.  One moment he's challenging Obama on [drones](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/05/rand-paul-calls-for-public-release-of-extrajudicial-killing-memos/362058/), next he's [calling out the GOP on voter id](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/rand-paul-gop-voter-id-106543.html) and then he's telling an implausible lie about the [ACA](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rand-pauls-latest-aca-whopper).  Most politicians (or people for that matter) you already know what they're going to say on any subject, but I'll give Rand Paul his due for keeping us guessing. 




 But there's still time for another resolution to repeal it.  Come on House of Representatives!  Make your opinion known. 




 It is ludicrous isn't it?  George Will complains that the scientists are corrupted by Federal Funding and never mentions that some of the climate change deniers might just have a financial interest in their point of view. 




 Sure, but let's also remember that the OWS was a genuine grass roots movement, not an astroturf outside funded movement like the Tea Party.  I'm inclined to think social movements often sputter out a couple of times before they catch fire.  It's not like civil rights movement began the day Rosa Parks decided not to give up her seat on the bus.  If OWS turns out to be a only catalyst, that might be all America is ready for.  I remain optimistic, although I'll admit in part because I can't stand to think of my kids growing up in the world the right wing wants to create. 




 Well, he's certainly got the [sucking ass to the base](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/11/rubio-climate-change_n_5305082.html) part down. 




 I wouldn't dismiss OWS so flippantly.  Income inequality was not part of the mainstream conversation before their protests.  Maybe we haven't seen much in results yet, but  the issue isn't readily dismissed anymore. 




 Can we all just agree that George Will is a tedious old git and ignore him? 




 Wonder why they limit themselves to criticizing scientists who work in climate change and evolution?  Why not also dispute the findings in particle physics and entomology? 




 Just red meat for the base.  




 Maybe not, but they can do a lot of damage while trying. 




 Even so, 97% of climate scientists agree that the burning of fossil fuels is the primary driver of the warming observed in recent decades. Should policy really be based on the minuscule chance that they're wrong?

Nice to see USA Today writing an editorial like this, but why did it take this long for their editorial board to acknowledge the obvious? 




 Anytime anyone says anything is 'eminently fair', they know it isn't. 




 We've been down this route before.  The Supreme Court was quite partisan in the decade leading up to the civil war.  Still, I can't help but worry that we'll never make it back to a more co-operative politics.  




 As he observes, the most radical pro-ALEC governor is Walker, whose tax-cutting and anti-union zeal has propelled him into the race for the GOP Presidential nomination for 2016. His state's economic performance has been dismal, as ALEC's own figures show. Walker predicted that his policies would result in job growth of 250,000; so far he's fallen short by more than 94,000. 

And if that's not enough.

What's worst about these ALEC policies, Chinn reports, is that the relentless budget-cutting they require leave crucial state services, particularly education, gasping for breath. That's a formula for long-term decline, not growth.

The Republican party, mean-spirited and short sighted.
 




 You'd think all these Bible loving conservatives would knoq that privatizing tax collections is a [bad idea](http://ancientroadpublications.com/Studies/BiblicalStudies/TaxCollectors.html). 




 If I had the money, I'd put up a billboard in Waukesha (one of Wisconsin's Republican strongholds) that reads something like.  'Scott Walker has received $47 million from outside interests.  Is he giving them their money's worth?'  or 'Scott Walker has received $47 million dollars from interests outside the state.  And you think he's working for you?'  I am puzzled why the Wisconsin Democrats (or Democrats anywhere for that matter) don't make an issue of how beholden Republican politicians are to their sponsors.  Bought and paid for. 
 




 It's it makes no sense, there's a good chance it's the Republican position. Works for most issues. 




 Rand Paul - boldly challenging the facts! 




 So does this mean if you watch [Fox News] (http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/john-farrell/2010/12/22/university-study-fox-viewers-more-misinformed) you shouldn't vote? 




 Not to mention the rest of *Lola vs. Powerman* or *Something Else*.  And they were one of the inventors of power pop.  




 No, I'm talking about the person who downvoted chaim-the-eez for agreeing with you.   




 Don't let one person's idiocy get you down.  




 If you want to read a refutation of this article, read the New York Times article it [links to](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/business/economy/making-sense-of-income-inequality.html?_r=1).  Especially the last few paragraphs. 

One of the plausible consequences of rising inequality is that it allows the 1 percent to take control of the political system, purchasing the power needed to maintain the status quo. If that is the case  and there is plenty of suggestive evidence of this  the widening of the income gap would prove irreversible. Mr. Jencks describes the state of the debate between friends and foes of inequality in these terms: Can I prove that anything is terrible because of rising inequality? Not by the kind of standards I would require. But can they prove I shouldnt worry? They cant do that either. That, alone, is enough to spur action. Something that looks bad is coming at you, he said. Saying that we shouldnt do anything about it until we know for sure would be a bad response.

That last statement is also a pretty good argument for starting to make the adjustments needed for climate change, starting now. 




 Unfortunately, it appears that 'Use it or lose it' is starting to apply to voting. 




 The question isnt whether the federal government should help; the question is how, Mr. Ryan said at the hearing on Wednesday. How do we make sure that every single taxpayer dollar we spend to reduce poverty is actually working?

Do you thing Paul Ryan is equally concerned that 'every dollar' spent on the military or every trickle-down special tax break on investments is 'actually working'? 









 As dismaying as the prospect of Sarah Palin as Vice President was,  I sometimes think having Paul Ryan next in line for the Presidency was even more frightening. 




 If you were determined to cast an invalid vote, it would probably be fairly easy to do. But it [simply doesn't happen very often](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/voter-fraud-real-rare/story?id=17213376). Not really much personal advantage to it, and the penalties are harsh. 




 For all the population, the average is 11%, but in certain sub-groups, the percentage will be higher or lower.  




 Studies show that as many as 11 percent of eligible voters do not have government-issued photo ID. That percentage is even higher for seniors, people of color, people with disabilities, low-income voters, and students. Many citizens find it hard to get government photo IDs, because the underlying documentation like birth certificates (the ID one needs to get ID) is often difficult or expensive to come by. At the same time, voter ID policies are far more costly to implement than many assume. Instead, Improvements in voting technology and modernization of our voter registration system will both increase efficiency and close the door on mistakes and fraud.

 I've always thought Paul Ryan was easy to understand, if you know one fact about him and remember one maxim.
Fact) Paul Ryan was voted biggest brown-noser by his high school classmates. 
Maxim) Character reveals itself early. 




 His big job in politics is to write budgets. And his big budget idea is that rich people should pay lower taxes, middle class and working class people should pay more taxes, and poor people should get less food, medicine, and college tuition.

But if he stands around some poor people with a concerned frown on his face, maybe no one will notice what his budget says. 




 Or don't even bother to read his budget. Paul Ryan's ideas are easy to understand : Government money spent on poor people - Bad.  Lower taxes on the wealthy - Good.   




 And where does the author back up his claim that the "worst Actors were in the White House, not on Wall Street."?  He lists all the things the Clinton White House did that he doesn't like, but nowhere discusses the  actions of Wall Street and why Clinton's actions were worse. If someone were to tell you that Fords are not as reliable a car as a Volkswagen, and only listed the problems with Fords, would you consider that argument convincing?  




 Kind of slow on the uptake there, aren't you Top Republicans? 




 How would the existence of a properly priced subprime market have caused a crash? 




 Newly released memos from the Clinton presidential library reveal evidence the government had a big hand in the housing crisis. **The worst actors were in the White House, not on Wall Street.**

 




 Let's also blame Clinton for the rating services giving triple AAA ratings to housing backed securities, Greenspan's mistakes, and for the rampant dishonesty among bankers.  Might as well pin everything on him. 




 I'm a whole lot more concerned about the boys like Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Paul Ryan.  These [naughty boys](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/rep-lowey-calls-paul-ryan-naughty-boy) are driving the Republican agenda, but appear to have the emotional maturity of adolescents.   Even the [National Review](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/375765/rand-pauls-foreign-policy-situation-room-or-dorm-room-rich-lowry) and [Right Turn](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/04/29/dont-be-a-jerk-sen-cruz/) find these 'gentleman' lacking. And Ryan seems to missed some basic rules in his upbringing, [about telling the truth](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/paul-ryans-dishonest-speech/2012/08/30/16bb62d8-f24f-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_blog.html). 





























 [Empire of Liberty](http://www.amazon.com/Empire-Liberty-History-Republic-1789-1815/dp/0199832463) is my choice.   Misinformation about the Founding Fathers intents and America's early years are used to justify all brands of nonsense.  It would be harder to get away with if we all had a basic understanding of our history. Well written book too.

Edit to include the book title, not just the link. And I missed a word in the title 'If you **could** require...'
