 This happened somewhere else, but it doesn't surprise me that similar things have happened in other places.

 Right? I loved that dog so much more after I found out that she saved my parent's life. Coincidentally, I married a dog trainer. 




 I never really found out the whole answer, but I was told that he just hated God and hated the church and wanted to do something about it, so he chose my family as the thing to destroy. 




 This all took place in the mid 90's when I was about 12. My dad is a Pastor, and we used to live next door to the church in a small town of about a hundred people in the middle of a farming community. One night, I spent the night at my friend's house which was on the same block, about two houses away. I have no idea how, but I ended up sleeping all the way through the night, and when I woke up I was told something about a fire and that we were going to meet my parents at a breakfast for the firefighters. When we drove by the church, the back side of it was burned black through to the frame and there was smoke damage everywhere, not to mention water damage from the firefighting. Again, this was only a couple hundred feet from where my friend lived so I have no idea how I slept through all of it. 

There was an investigation as to the cause of the fire, but since it was such a small community with limited resources, the cause was never fully determined. It was just assumed that the fire started in my Dad's office because of his computer and other electronics in there. My grandfather was a firefighter for his whole career and he stopped by and looked at the damage, and in his opinion, he said that there was no way that an electrical short could have caused the kind of fire damage that the building endured. Months go by, things are returning to normal as the church is being rebuilt, and finally it's finished and we start having services in the church again. One day, one of the youth gets up front because he says he has something to say. My spidey-sense is tingling because this isn't normal, his whole family is up there with him and he can't look anyone in the eye. He confesses to burning the church, and my jaw just drops. I can't imagine any other time in my life where I've been as horrifically shocked as I was at that moment. He turns himself into the police, makes his statement, and then does community service at the church. He didn't go to jail because he was a juvenile. I can't remember if he had any kind of detention or not. 

Now the scary part. I didn't find out about this until much later, probably when I was 16 or 17 and we had moved away from there. My dad got a call from the police and they said he needed to come in to read the statement that was given by the guy who burned the church. He declined and said that he had already talked to him, and he was ok with it. The police insisted, and told him there was something in the report that he didn't know. My dad went down to the police station, read the report, and found out that the night the church was burned something else had happened. In the middle of the night, while I was over at my friend's house, our family dog started acting weird and insisted to be let outside. My dad got up and let her out and didn't bother waiting for her to want to come back in. After that, both of my parents said my dog was growling and making sounds that they had never heard her make before, like she was trying to keep something out of the yard. Sure enough, on the police report the guy who burned the church said that his intentions were to set my family's house on fire and kill all of us, but he couldn't get in the yard because he was scared of our dog (she was a husky-shepard mix). Another important detail- our house was covered in this foam insulation that would have engulfed the whole house in flames in no time. 

Since I wasn't told about it until later in life, it took awhile for it to sink in. Even though I wasn't home at the time, there's still a police report out there that says that someone tried to kill me. I don't know if you ever really get over something like that, but you use it to help you remember that life is precious and to take advantage of every day. 

TL;DR Someone tried to burn down my house when I was a kid with my family inside, but was stopped before he got the chance.

 Amateur audio engineering. To have a decent setup you can expect an initial investment of a few thousand dollars which will get you an audio interface, cables, a microphone or two, and a digital audio workstation. That will allow you to record about one instrument at a time. If you want virtual instruments, expect to pay about $500 for a somewhat decent library, and then you need a MIDI keyboard or external controller to play them with. Then if you need effects for processing your signals you pay more, and if you need decent preamps you pay more, better microphones, better interface... and so on. Once you get to a certain point you have to consider having a dedicated space to record, and that means adding acoustic treatment for the room. To have enough equipment to record a 4-5 piece band with professional gear will set you back over $100,000.  




 No other intro gets me as pumped up to watch 21+ hours of a movie franchise as this one! 









 I would have a small piece of each planet in my house, and as many pieces from dwarf planets and large asteroids as I could get as well.
