 and I'd love to hear Dr.Richard Bandler to knock it in his own style... 




 "The worse the game is, the less the models wear"...not really... 




 That's the guy! Would love to get an apprenticeship at his... 




 "They live in the virtual world," Freakley said. He cited Facebook as a key component in targeting 18-to 24-year-olds. "You could friend your recruiter, and then he could talk to your friends." 




 "Youve heard the expression, everything is better with bacon - well, who knew that this included cupcakes." 




 How many innocent birds do they kill? 




 If I wanna fried eggs in the morning I need some power, yet I never judge the look of my power plant:)  




 what sort of gaylord lets himself be shaved by people online? 




 You could always share that 'sensitive data' with me my Scottish mate...:) 




 "Today, investment banks, the pride of Wall Street, have virtually ceased to exist. In just 12 months, they have posted losses exceeding the profits they made in the last 25 years. This example alone reflects the real situation better than any criticism." How was that possible??? + that ultra fat executive bonuses??? 




 Just too cute! 




 They shit in the woods of Atlantis 




 Just another 'corporate green PR spin'??? 




 That was hot...

 Art, yes...and very scary as well, sometimes:) 




 My congratulations, Stephanie! That was your first full marathon. Bravo! 




 I do hope that new American President will be much more green that Bush! 




 I know that, but I was brought up in a totally wrong way and I need to switch to the 'opposite side of the street', now. 




 Is fully green economy possible at all? 




 I like the quality difference between old fashioned GDP and modern GPI. 




 I loved the basic idea of not wasting my precious time for worrying about rubbish...:) 




 A short report from HighEdWeb Conference 2008. 




 I really don't know much about these amazing activities of 'Barefoot Solar Engineers', but would love to support them. I think, that we could learn so much more about practical use of renewable power sources. 




 I am still dreaming about similar dream:) 




 Solar power is the cleanest and the the best power source which powers absolutely all life forms on earth, except human activities...:)

 Apple is financially very strong global corporation with loads of cash in the bank (I don't know which bank? Hope not Lehman...:) 




 Lots of children are left alone these days to do whatever they like until they don't cause 'problems' for parents, and nobody really knows what are they really doing online. Poor kids, who don't get enough personal attention from their parents! 




 Is that one of the hot parts of that huge CERN hadron collider? 




 also my favorite choice 




 Lucky guy! 




 That has to be a very crazy, but cool festival in the Black Rock Desert of Northern Nevada! 




 And that amazingly explosive atmosphere and people who surround the skating event! One simply needs to be there to believe it! 




 These guys feel so comfortable even when in the air... 




 Competition on the market brings better products and services. Online document-hosting services are getting better, as well. 




 That Socotra Island is just surreal! 




 And all those hundreds of hours spent working with/by FF...I would think 10x times before change to anything else...

 I was scared to death in Alps, when fast summer storm started with crazy lightning and there were no good shelter:)...other things were just perfect for adrenaline junkery 




 it's very scary first time, but than you just want more and more...(of course, the supporting team of 'crazy free climbing guys' there in Slovenia was just too good)  




 I've done that many times in European Alps, but this is just truly amazing with those waterfalls! 




 Wow, I loved this link... a real Commodore 1541 floppy disk machine on the second page! (I was playing once with that and with black, old, big floppy disks)

 Only Extra Cold Guinness...a pint every 10 minutes...(hope it could dry the urge for a short time) 




 I know the island Wuranga on SecondLife...there's totally packed of ultra techno geeks

 I think, that production cost at low production scale and lack of Silicon in last year is not making huge profits for PV manufacturers. 




 They won't move a little finger without smelling a huge profit (especially not Microsoft and Google). They are not crazy to shovel their cash through the 'Windows' 




 They are just companies...they are not social services...they need to make profit or close their business 




 How red, you mean politically red or burned by too strong sun exposure? 




 I bet they have some wild underworld parties after midnight...they need to care about historical reputation, don't they? 




 It is just a shabby promotion, but I bet a successful one to grab attention. (it is so very uncomfortable to drag that loooong carriage) 




 But, it'll take some time to make it like today's Big and comfortable SUV 




 Yet, the sheer pressure from Oil corporations which are earning their record profits is much higher due to their Power Lobbying practices. They literally own political parties and all politicians. Clash of a Goliath and little ants. 




 Governments heavily subsidize coal, oil and nuclear energy sources...and they don't want changes in their money spreading schemes 




 Any big car corporation just need to really commit to the goal and we are going to get a nice and useful product quite soon 




 a cow, of course!
