 So you would take the new shield even with the really low block rate? 




 Hey guys, so i've been playing a lightning crusader for a while and im pretty bored with it. I want to switch to fire, but i have +lightning dmg on a bunch of gear, and not many souls to reroll it to fire. So basically what im asking is, what should i look for as a fire crusader? i know i should try and get a cindercoat and maximus, but is there anything i should look for/spend most shards on? Any other advice/tips are welcome :)

Although im not sure of availability in canada for that one either.  




 looks awesome, but as far as i can tell it's not available in Canada yet, but im in no rush to buy so i think i'll wait for this one to come out. Thanks a ton
