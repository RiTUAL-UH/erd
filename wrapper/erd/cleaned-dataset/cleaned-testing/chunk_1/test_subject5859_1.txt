 I appreciate you taking the time to write.  She knows I wouldn't do anything with her friends.  I think it's more that she was really open with her friends (which she usually isn't) and it backfired.  So she's even more closed off now and feels super insecure and judged.  Most of her friends are trying to make her feel better about it all, but the few that she used to trust have ruined it.  I personally talked to each of the ones that were being forward with me and made it clear how I felt and whatnot.  One of them even went so far as to feel my crotch while we were talking and beg to see it.  Needless to say, she was a quick 'unfriend' on Facebook. 




 My girlfriend told all her friends how well-endowed I am, and now several of them are being creepy, hitting on me, and doing other things which are hurting our relationship.  She's usually very shy, hadn't been with another man before me, and told them during a friend's bachelorette party not thinking my size was that big of a deal.  Some sort of bacherlorette-based Truth or Dare game.  


She's really embarrassed now and thinks she's ruined the relationship with me and with her friends and questions her friendship with the girls that have been forward with me.  (I continue to tell her that she did nothing wrong and that the friends that are hitting on me cannot be her close friends if they continue to do this.  You cannot be friends with those you don't trust.)  I can tell it's really affecting her view of our relationship. 


Any suggestions on how to reassure her?  She's convinced she's ruined everything and feels really uncomfortable around her friends and doesn't always enjoy being affectionate with me anymore.

Edited for clarity.
