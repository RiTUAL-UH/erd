 I do. I was commenting on the fact that most people seem to not like how their characters were being handled, this season, as opposed to the last two. To me, they seemed to come out on top a lot, the last two seasons. My apologies, I should have been more clear. 
 




 Yeah, I didn't care too much for that subplot, either. But I was surprised by the ending of it, though.  




 Man, I really dislike all of the hate Claire is getting, this season, too. I really don't think it's hard for people to change, like Claire has been doing. She was ruthless the first two seasons, but not a psychopath like Frank. Which is why I think the writers has been showing more of her humanity, this season, despite how many mishaps she's been having. People make mistakes. I don't think she  has what it took to be an ambassador( which was clear, throughout the season) and she obviously knew that. All the pressure just got to her, you know? If any of you were in her situation, the same would happen to you. 
Besides, I think it's incredibly bad writing to just have the main characters come out on top, all of the time. That gets boring. A great example of this is the character Superman. He's completely overpowered. Yes, he has kryptonite to slow him down, but he's a very boring character because he's practically unstoppable. So, I think it's great that Claire and Francis hasn't been succeeding, this entire season. Otherwise it would just get predictable.  




 Oh my gosh. I did not know that was a thing. Thank you!!  




 Oh, and Robin Wright. I've never seen her in anything before HoC, so I was taken by surprise of her acting ability and how gorgeous that woman is. Good Lord.  




 Pretty neat, show. 
Well, that's an understatement. 
It's a gorgeous looking show; well written and well acted. I see in the title credits that David Fincher is an executive producer. Makes sense. His movies seem to have somewhat of the same aesthetic as this show. Meaning, his movie and the show seem to have the same color pallet. The mutes blues, yellows and oranges, which I love. This show is gorgeously lit. I'm not sure if Fincher has some of his film crew working on the show or not, but I feel like I'm watching a Fincher movie, with every episode. 
I know it's too late in the game for this, seeing as the show has established a feel, but I would honestly love for Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross to score the show. Their work for Gone Girl is my favorite body of work. 
House of Cards is good television.
