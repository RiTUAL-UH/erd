 How the hell, first i tried easy stuff like Soul Eater and Deadman Wonderland, but even Shaman King.
Woah amazing and creepy at same time :D 




 yeah that one about Empire was hard lesson for me. I started betting with about 5 value and made it up to my first arcana and then Empire vs Denial came.
RIP arcana :( 




 I ve began watching anime cuz of amv - Soul Eater - Becoming Insane  




 Well most people who talk about Boku no Pico probably never heard of Bondage Game: Shinsou no Reijoutachi - this one is really,ehhhh....well its probably only one of its kind to say at least.
 




 Well it wasnt really cancelled but i think Soul Eater would really deserve the ending it got in manga and not that city fighting bullshit. 




 yeah you totaly have to read the manga after the anime coz when the anime is rushed to end manga s just begging 




 Well i would probably say
Soul Eater 
or
Noragami 
also Black Bullet (curently airing) 




 Thanks for so long and insightful answer.
So first about Akira - i watched and i liked it even trough it was kinda mindfuck.
FLCL - i ve seen like 3 ep and i was like WTF?! im planning to watch more but i cant force myself to
DTB - amazing one, just watchin it
Samurai Champloo is on the list same goes for Baccano.
I know i will have to watch Cowboy Bebop and Trigun at some point :) and for the Hunter x Hunter im gonna give it another shot - i watched few first episodes and it just didnt pull me in, but maybe i just wasnt far enough. Guess im gonna try the Black Lagoon then go for Samurai Champloo and as for manga i will give a Berserk a shot. 




 God bless you i tried to do it but i didnt know how :) (new to this whole reddit thing :))
