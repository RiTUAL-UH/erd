 Well, statistically it is not as bad as you think it is.  Here is my very specific example: I used to live in Louisa County, Iowa which is in Tornado Alley.  There was one time in the 14 years I was there that several tornados came through.  0 fatalities.  Here is the hard data: http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/Iowa/Louisa/table  




 The assistant principal at my high school outlawed purses on the basis that carrying them was sexist against boys (although there was no rule that they couldn't.... they would just have to put up with harassment from their male peers....).  So my sister and her friends threaded a string through tampon boxes and wore them as purses while they dragged their car keys behind them on another string.  Believe it or not, the rule against purses stopped being enforced.  This is some cheek, I can't believe it worked.  Back in my day, I just carried a billfold that constantly fell out of my inadequate female pockets.  




 A toad.  I was camping and I saw this toad hopping towards the fire pit.  I fished him out as quick as I could but his back legs were all melted and he was chirping.  I set him down and stomped him as hard as I could as an act of mercy.  I still feel guilty.  




 If you wrap your warm soda can in a wet paper towel before you put it in the freezer for 20 minutes, it will be consistently cold rather than that kind-of sort-of cold you get normally.  (Always set a timer on your phone when putting sodas in the freezer, dear ones.) 




 Sorry for being redundant! :) 




 I'm sincere but not serious whenever I joke around with my dementia patients in Hospice.  Obviously dementia is not funny, but when we laugh together, it's not so scary for a moment.  




 This isn't exactly what you're asking, but I think it's pretty funny in retrospect.  My ex-boyfriend let his mother think I took his v-card, so she was pretty much awful to me (the son thief who turned him on to premarital sex).... I'm not sure what she thinks he was doing at college for three years.   




 TROLL ALERT.... LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THIS IS NOT A DRILL.  WE HAVE A TROLL. 

Edit: This is very ironic... So many people upset about how feminists don't call out extremists in their own group, and yet I'm getting downvoted.  Oh, Reddit, do you really know what you want?  




 Right, I don't claim to have all the answers.  What I took issue with is the statement (that you did not make) that women only claim feminism when it benefits them.  I don't believe this to be the case.  A lot of "feminist issues" are merely human issues, and, indeed, a lot of men's issues happen to be feminist issues.  You offered an example of when women failed to pull the feminist card so to speak.  I refuted it with a very specific example.  I am not a feminist when it is convenient.  I help where I can.   




 Well, you're setting a great example for how to take another road.  I'm not on the same page as you are, but you made me stop and examine what it is I believe, and that is a beautiful thing.  Thank you for being respectful and for taking the time to try to enlighten people.  I appreciate you.  




 I am so sorry for what I'm about to say here, because it's not something that can be proven, it is merely anecdotal, but any man who thinks that a girl need only cry "rape" and ruin his life has very little first hand experience with how things actually work.  I'm sorry to say that when my best friend went to our FEMALE HR director because her boss sent her unsolicited messages on Facebook about his sex dreams about her (he being married and twice her age), her exact words to my male boss was "There was something more going on there, she was pursuing him, I'd bet my life." She was pursuing an overweight, bald man with a wife and three children.  She was asking to be put in a situation where she had no idea what to do and agonized over whether to get help for over a month.  She was forced to remain under this man for almost a year until she was promoted beyond him.  She wasn't raped.  This isn't comparable to a rape.  But think about Brandon Teena.  A female to male transgender person who was raped by two men.  Look into how successful he was when he tried to get help. 




 This was sheer brilliance.  




 Edit: Sorry, I thought I was talking to the same person the whole time here.

Shutupharu: I'm glad you're giving me a chance to explain.  Direct combat wasn't something that women were allowed into without fighting for that right.  It's a job with a high probability of fatalities and we fought to do it. :)

Monty 845: I don't think that what you're suggesting is altogether reasonable, you see, I don't want to put my life in peril, but I'm quite sure that if I did, I could apply for a job on an oil rig.  However, I'm sure I wouldn't be physically capable of doing the job.  Do I think that the job should be made easier for me?  Absolutely not.  Full disclosure: I would rather be carried out of a burning building than dragged out by a woman, BUT do I think that a woman shouldn't be turned away without giving her a chance to prove herself?  Absolutely.  You see?  We're not all crazy.  




 I think it is very admirable that you can view a terrible experience as a positive lesson.  I'm also glad that you were able to come to terms with your rape.  I'm sure you're a vibrant and interesting person who deserves to be happy.  Thank you for existing.  




 I know you're not going to do this, but I encourage you to look into sexual assault statistics for the U.S. Armed Forces, and then to remember that until very recently, all assaults were to be reported to your direct commanding officer (you know, the person that would be reprimanded for that kind of behavior going on within their contingent).  Before I get accused of being callous of assaults on men, I'm absolutely not.  It breaks my heart that so many of them suffer in silence thanks to the idea that one of the worst things you can be in this society is "a little bitch." 




 I'm sorry that that happened to you.  Truly.  




 I am now going to systematically upvote all your comments everywhere to show my sisterly support of you.  Yes really.  Don't thank me, it's not about me.  It's about you.  I only wish I could do more.  




 Very eloquently put. I dislike the misconception that feminist issues only affect women positively.  Men are nearly twice as likely to commit suicide and that has not a little to do with the myths that men are not allowed to be anything other than hyper-masculine.  I've never seen a feminist cheer when they read a story about a young man being raped by an adult women, that's a feminist issue too.  I sincerely hope that your optimism is borne out.  Thank you for your thoughtful and brave response.  




 Can I just say I like your swagger?  I'm crying out of one eye now. 




 Put the bunneh back in the bahx.  




 Con Air.  SOOOO GOOOD SOOOO BAD. 




 "Mind your p's and q's" is actually supposed to mean "Mind your pints and quarts," meaning don't get drunk and pick fights with people.  Most folks think it means "Be polite." 




 His heart is in the right place.

 Go outside... Chew some gum... walk as fast as you can while you chew the gum.  I bet your rage doesn't last ten minutes.  This works for heading off a panic attack too.  




 If you get one from me, I either agree with what you're saying, find you well spoken, was entertained, or appreciate your support.  Getting one seems 100% random.  You never know what redditors will like, it seems.  




 What are the Basement Jaxx for 300?  




 "I'm sorry that no one has responded to this question yet. I don't exactly fit the bill for what you're asking, but I am a volunteer who spends about six hours a week as a companion in Hospice. In our training, we are taught to encourage whatever the person is feeling. If they are angry, yeah! You be angry! If they are sad, we are to cry with them. If they can't really communicate, we're to hold their hand and just let them know we're here and we care. We had a speaker come in and share that the four most important things we can say to someone who is dying are "I love you," "Thank you," "I'm sorry," and "I forgive you." This dovetails nicely with what you're asking. The best way to come to terms with your own death is to live a life where if you were killed tomorrow, you wouldn't wish you had said any of these things. Don't wait. Just be brave and live." 




 Reading an interview with Billy Corgran without making this face: :-/ 




 I upvoted this, but I think you mean staying happily married to someone who is famous.  Why do they even bother getting married?  What is the point, I ask?  




 The pages of a book! Nothing better. :) 




 I think that the one thing about it that really got to me was the rage in the rebuttal against people saying they care about the health of people they don't know personally.  I think that all life is precious, and my anxiety tends to focus on death a lot.  One of the ways I struggle is when people don't hide their internal machinery well.  Just as I get nervous around people who work out too much and wear their veins sticking out, I get nervous around obese people because eating is the ultimate proof of mortality.  If you get hungry, you are going to die and that is very sad.  Is it such a bad thing to not want people you know personally to die?  Why wouldn't you believe that I care?  The heart is such an uncomfortable concept even in a healthy person, but the fact that I knew a person who was so morbidly obese their heart failed trying to beat against the back of his ribcage is terrifying for me.  I don't want that for anyone.  (I'm sorry, I know this was 100% weird, but it was also serious.)  




 Read.  Reading makes you more emphatic, thoughtful, introspective, knowledgable, and kind.  If you simply can't go out and experience things first hand, you can always read about them until you get to that point.   




 That divorce is a sad thing.  For example, Neil Young and Peggi Young getting divorced after 30 years of marriage.  At first I was like how sad, but now I'm like, you know, Peggi is nearly 70, Neil is obviously cranky (yes brilliant, but c'mon you know he is cranky as fuck), good for her! Go be free!  See new people and do what you want!  GO!  




 Saxondale. 




 If you aren't selected for trial, you're on call for two weeks. Hope this helps!  




 Almost every piece that was featured in the Granta issue "Betrayal" has stuck with me.  It forced me to think about a lot of really uncomfortable things.   




 I used to have these super graphic violent dreams about animals.  The worst one starts with me coming out of a stall in a mall restroom and there was this overweight lady torturing a dachshund with a taser.  I left the restroom and there where these people all crowded together in a circle.  When I pushed my way in, I saw that they were trying to tear this toucan apart with their hands.  The toucan was jerking his head and making this clicking noise in his throat and he had a tear coming out of one of his eyes.  It fucked me up for a very long time. I can still hear that clicking sound.    




 Lots of people dip their jelly toast points into a fried egg.  I just make a fried egg and jelly toast sandwich.  




 Jeremiah Johnson 




 I don't know about best ever, period, the end, but the best acted scene I've ever seen is Robert Redford at the end of Jeremiah Johnson when Bear Claw observes that the "Winters run long up here."  The sheer amount of pain that man managed to get into a "Yeah," it fucking rends my heart every time.  BRAVO REDFORD, Bra-VO. 




 This doesn't ruin my day, but it annoys the fuck out of me: If the CEO's phone rings three times with no answer, it rolls to me.  People will wait until it rolls to me and then hang up.  This leaves a stupid missed call icon on my phone that I can only get rid of by calling them back.  




 You click your username and then pick the downvoted tab. 




 I don't think so.  Here is why: I once encountered a boy who was not very solicitous or interesting or funny or even a good sport.  He was not conventionally attractive, in fact he was a bit overweight and kind of looked like a penguin.  But when I would sit down next to him, I would get hyper, mega turned on.  I couldn't sleep next to him, I was too aroused.  It had to be pheromones.  I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he had no similar reaction to me.  I think the real question is how much of any of this had to do with the fact that I'd been on hormonal birth control for five years at that point.     




 Too cold to snow.  




 The question was "Something that sounded great in theory and was fucking terrible in practice." My response was breastfeeding.  Apparently the plight of new mothers is extremely unpopular.   




 I just checked the parent company's website and the only thing we're looking for is in Hartford for an engineer.... I pulled up a lot of results by just looking for "call center CT" in Google, I'd do that since I don't know specifically what city you're in. :) 




 I used to work for an outsourcing call center (this isn't telemarketing, it's mostly utility company customer service), and I can tell you that call centers offer an awful lot of upward mobility.  My former boss only had a GED and he's making well over $60k a year as the call center manager.  He started as an agent on the phones.  I was there for five years, was promoted four times, and was making $20.18/hr when I left.  I wish you good luck, sir! :)

Edit: I should say "Call Center Manager" is a title. It sounds like he was just a general type manager reading it again... He wasn't, he over saw the team of 12 major supervisors and all of their team leads, who were responsible for 300+ employees under them.  He ran the whole center and sometimes more than one location. I figured I should clarify. :) 




 How would I know? I'm an American!  Good job, media ban! :) 




 The 9 times tables.  Or any other times table come to that.  




 He made a blog for the sole purpose of complaining about me, describing our break-up as "harrowing."  I promise I didn't try to push him off a cliff.  




 No! Who the hell is Russel Williams?  If he's under a media ban, it's working!  




 Hey, thank you!  I'm not, but I like to write them occasionally.  I'm also fond of this one, although it is not on topic : Cactus in sweater / Never to be cold again / in the starry night 

or how about this one about how my mom hates carnies? : Sticky hand pulls me / seeds rattle in sweaty cup / do not talk to them

Obviously I don't take myself very seriously, but my post was supposed to be about how the world calls to you and your family calls to you and you need to remember you belong to both. :) 




 I'm with you.  I steadfastly believe that folks who don't like eggplant don't know you're supposed to press them.  They're amazing!   




 I have seen them all, and I don't like any of them.  Apart from uniformly suffering from pacing issues, he just can't seem to help himself when it comes to cheeky jokes within his films.  He just seems so damn pleased with himself!  Also, three of his most famous films completely missed the point of the reference material thanks to his casting choices.  That is very upsetting to me.  




 Oh, ANYTHING by Stanley Kubrick.  




 Stars bright over house / Warm light from inside places / They shine for you too 




 How about the most awkward thing I do on a consistent basis?  If you text me and I don't want to talk to you or wish you didn't have my number, I'll respond with "Who is this?" 




 I'm going to be telling people about this side-quest where I gain a severed arm as a weapon for the rest of my life.  So far, it's been true.  I'm doing it now.  HagtagGimblesProsthetics.  




 If by best you mean so bad it's almost good, probably the date-rape montage in Dahmer which featured "More, More, More," as the soundtrack.  




 Saxondale. 




 For me, it is explaining something totally implausible by throwing in that there was another dimension at the last possible moment.  I'm looking at you, Clive Barker.  




 I'm not really sure what you're looking for from me since our experiences are very, very different.  I can't go back in a time machine and make my interactions as a person working for a Fortune 500 subsidiary that happened to use a temp agency any different from what they are.  Our entry level employees are paid $8.50 when they hit the door.  We pay $16.50 an hour to the temp agency for people who temp in those same positions.  Obviously if we can buy out their contract, it's better to do so as soon as possible.  We have to pay that hourly fee while we train them, a time when they are not generating any profit for our company.  I'm sorry you feel you need to argue with me, but maybe the area we live in plays a factor here.   




 Just look up Luke Magnotta on Wikipedia.  I was serious.  




 While I appreciate that you have a very strong opinion that is likely rooted in experience, it happens to be at odds with what I've seen.  It's definitely true that places are not obligated to hire on a temp, they're paying a premium for  your work and have already had to eat training costs.  You'd be a much better candidate than a person off the street would be, having come from a temp agency for that reason alone.   




 1 lunatic 1 icepick is totally real.  




 100%, although after Stephen Collins, I'm seriously worried it's going to be the next equality frontier.  I can just hear it now.... "I was born this way..." "I don't actually harm children...." 




 It was yesterday.  I asked for help in building a set-up to play vinyl records within my specific budget.  I'm happy to say I put in an order that night.  Thanks, Reddit!  




 I am a big advocate of researching cooking techniques before you start, but if it's too late for that, use a cooking thermometer.  Safe internal temps are different for each kind of product.  :) 

If you don't have one, as a last resort, pick a really thick item you've cooked, cut into it.  If the juice is clear instead of red, you're good.  




 My advice is actually to sign on with a temp company.  Temp companies are used to extremely high employee turnover, so they tend to skip doing background checks.  Because a temp agency is supposed to run a background check, the company you are matched with will likely not do one.  This is how my former company ended up with several level 1 sex offenders on the payroll.  Let my disturbing experience be your boon!  Best of luck to you... It's awesome that you're so driven. :) 




 I think a better question is why is Neil Young still Canadian when he's lived in California the vast majority of his life?  Can you answer this OP?  I'm dead serious.   




 I know that you guys do media freezes for atrocious crimes.  The average American has no idea who Paul Bernardo is, and definitely have never heard of Luke Magnotta, which is crazy when you think about it.  




 Thanks for being a good sport. ;-)

 I love it when a man isn't afraid of asking about things he doesn't understand.  Wanting to learn is very sexy and it connotes that you understand that seeking knowledge is always more important than saving face.  If you don't know what "loquacious" means, ask me! I would love to explain it to you. :) 




 I like your style. 




 I actually don't care, so long as it isn't what it is.  Before and after I'm married, my name is unique to the entire planet (or at least folks searchable on the internet), meaning if you know my damn name, you can find me.  This has happened. 




 I thought of a good one... My mom once said to my cousin Jason that he could go into the basement and have Hot Sex with Grandma.  She was down in the basement drinking Hot Sex which I think is sort of like Bailey's.  He turned so red you could've fried an egg on his head.  




 Hardcore Pawn.  (Which in no way stops me from watching it.) 




 Well, I wish I could agree with you, but American Tabloid was the last straw for me.  These days, I'd take a good Southern Gothic over any gumshoe story.  Thanks for the banter! :)  




 Since you mentioned Black Dahlia.... Teddy bears with locks of children's hair taped between their legs? 




 You start knitting and wait for her to approach you because you're that interesting guy who isn't afraid to knit. 




 Start knitting.  Go to your local yarn shop and knit.  Blog about knitting.  You will not believe how many cute girls knit these days.  I follow 15 boy knitters on Tumblr just because they are boys who knit. None of them happen to like girls, but you see.... there's a niche here.  You only need google "Ryan Gosling knitting" to see what the hell I'm talking about. 




 In this blog, he described our break-up as "harrowing."  I mean, at that moment, part of me was like "Don't be so dramatic," but part of me was like "Yesss, he thinks I am Liam Neeson."  




 I'm walking to a meeting I'm already late for.  I have to present at the meeting, but I'm not prepared and it involves math.  I'm stuck behind someone who is walking very slowly.  They are wearing flip-flops that they are dragging across the floor.  They are also whistling.  While all of this is happening, I'm wearing pantyhose and an ill-fitting outfit.  It's 90 degrees inside with 60% humidity.  




 How has no one said eggnog?  If you drink a whole carton of eggnog, you will regret it with your body and your soul.  Just ask my husband.  




 A subscription to Granta.  Every issue challenges me to think about things I never have before and to examine my reactions closely.  




 Almost anything for your infant. Almost.  




 I went back and looked at every letter and e-mail and chat history and birthday card I ever exchanged with him.  Looking at everything in order as a cohesive progression allowed me to come to conclusions I had avoided before.  By the time I was done, I realized I never wanted to be with him at all, I just wanted to be him.  I felt that he was what I could be if I weren't afraid.  He was me without limits.  




 I'm a woman, and my contribution is slipping into a hot bath when you're really cold.  




 Me and the unsightly callous on my right ring finger approve of your contribution.  




 Anything where people employ aggressive upselling.  Cable, insurance, funeral services. 




 Backstory aside, let me tell you for future reference, that yes, a teenage girl could absolutely get pregnant the day before her period.  A woman's cycle especially when she is young, can be far from consistent.  There is a possibility that it's not a period at all but implantation spotting.  You should be practicing safe sex if you don't want to impregnant someone.  It's as simple as that.  




 Red Velvet Oreos. 




 That is so rude, outting me like that!  




 Dr. Pepper.... Did you know that Dr. Pepper is actually owned cooperatively by Pepsi and Coke?  Read about the Soda Wars of the 90's.  Fascinating stuff.  




 I would think since I'm 105 lbs and a C-cup you would be like, o bby, bring your neurosis over here.  Tell me more about how you like to count things.  




 All of our survival instincts are suddenly not allowed.  You can't run away.  As a female, I find police to be terrifying.  









 Hello;
Does anyone know off hand why the Pro-Ject is a better choice and thus higher price than the TEAC? 
Thank you for your help! :)  




 Hello; I'm looking to buy a full set up for about $800, with a bit of wiggle room.  Can you please suggest what would be the best use of my money?  Thank you... this is way overwhelming!
