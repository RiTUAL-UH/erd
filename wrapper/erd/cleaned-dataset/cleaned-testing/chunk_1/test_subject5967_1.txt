 Should we spot start Lincecum for Hudson's next start? Best case scenario he just needs rest.  




 If we're going to be successful in the playoffs, Hudson is going to have to step up. Depending on how tonight goes, I'll either be feeling really good or really bad. 




 Nasty curveball. I ain't even mad.  




 Even she's tired of the Jeter circlejerk.  




 Even though you're right behind us in the WC standings, I can't bring myself to root against you. Hopefully we win the west and you guys can take care of the Dodgers.  




 Depends on what you want to do. For night life, the Gas Lamp, Pacific Beach and North Park are the main spots. The Gas Lamp is even cool during the day and it's within walking distance of PetCo. At night, it's a little showy, but a lot of fun. The trolley runs there, but it stops around 11:30. Pacific Beach is great at night too. It attracts a younger crowd, a lot of bros and hoes. Cabo Cantina will have more 21 year old girls than you'll ever see again in your life. You have to drive there though. North Park is the most laid back spot. It has a super hipster vibe. If you go here, be sure to check out Seven Grand and True North Tavern. 


During the day, I recommend visiting a brewery. San Diego has Stone, Green Flash, Mission, Ballast Point and a few others that I can't think of. I recommend Mission. Their Shipwreck IIPA is one of my favorite beers ever. Plus, you can take the trolley to 12th   Imperial, walk there and then either walk or trolley to the game.  




 Yeah, if you take the trolley it's pretty much an all day endeavour. You'll see more just staying in SD.  




 Curious what your plans are in Tijuana. I loved going there during college.  




 Because each of those fouls count as team fouls. Once a team gets 5 team fouls in a quarter, they will shoot free throws on all subsequent fouls, meaning that strategy will almost certainly result in other, better shooters shooting free throws.  




 Look at those fundamentals!  




 I thought I was in r/funny and your friend was [the only white person]( http://imgur.com/1939Q6h). 




 On one hand, I agree with you. NFL players aren't my role models and I don't look to them for moral guidance. On the other hand, I love watching the NFL mishandle these situations at every turn.  




 They played 4 games at LSU's stadium, 3 at the Alamodome and one at Giants Stadium.  




 This would have been an absolute heartbreaker to lose considering the Dodgers' result today. Now we're only 2 games back and feeling pretty good. I would much rather be heading to PetCo than Wrigley.  




 From San Diego or just visiting?  




 You mean Panda Frien...ooh.  




 What happens if the Giants either win the division or finish second in the wild card? Do you get a refund?  




 Dodgers scored a run. Why does that bother me so much?  




 What a weird week for the Dodgers. Lose 9-0 to us, come back the next day and win 17-0, and now they're losing 15-0 to the Rockies.  




 M M's with obstacles.  




 Runer at third. Batter strikes out on a ball in the dirt. Batter heads towards first. Susac throws runner out at first. Runner on third runs home.  




 This reminds me of one of JD Dorian's fantasies.  




 What happens in r/timlincecum stays in r/timlincecum.  




 No, no, it's "revved up like a douche in the middle of the night."  




 Gutierrez sniffing his hat... 




 This is awesome. I just drove past Raley Field last night. I would love to go to some games to see some future Giants. 


Also, Tony Torcato. That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.  




 Are the refs just quicker to throw flags this year? It seems like every game I've watched so far has had a lot of penalties. It really takes the life out of the game.  




 A lot of these penalties are legit, but it sure seems like the refs are quicker to throw flags this year. It really sucks the life out of a game.  




 That feeling when your outfielder dives for a ball and misses and you have to watch the batter run for days... 




 You know when you're playing RTTS and the pitcher you just created is getting rocked in his first AA game? That's how I feel right now, but I can't rage quit.  




 I really doubt it would have been overturned. It was too close.  




 It's not so bad. You get to win a World Series every couple years ;-) 




 Ugh...come on.  




 I think twice. Mixed results.  




 Gutierrez sniffing his hat... 




 I would call Bum's performance Kershaw-esque, but Kershaw usually gives up 1.67 runs/game.   




 Who holds the overall Giants single season strikeout record?  




 You just took the rivalry too far!  




 Get some garlic fries. They will turn around even the crappiest of nights.  




 Can someone summarize the story Vin told about Blanco? I'm up north and watching a different broadcast.  




 Unclinch!  




 Keep this troll at 0.  




 Just put in Brian Wilson already. That's who we really want.  




 [MRW I just spent a couple minutes in the Dodgers game thread.]( http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/article/100/1000475/hero-showdown-cartman-vs-stewie-20090701022443845-000.jpg) 




 If you're in nor cal, it's 31. The guide says it's family feud, but it's actually the game.  




 [Oh, they mad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dodgers/comments/2g8ulp/game_chat_912_dodgers_8363_giants_8165_715_pm_pt/ckgvi6a) 




 YOU GET A DOUBLE! YOU GET A DOUBLE! EVERYONE GETS A DOUBLE!  




 Why can't I find the game on TV?  




 That's what happened. Jeff didn't have room for it at his temporary place, so he had Tony hang on to it.  




 I don't know if my nerves could handle it though.  




 For a starter to get a win he needs to:

1. Pitch at least 5 innings.
2. Leave the game with the lead. Had Vogey finished the 7th, he would be in line for the win because the Giants scored in the bottom of the inning. 
3. His team cannot give up the lead for the rest of the game.  




 Kid's huffing paint out of that finger.  




 Nope. Machi will get the win if the score holds.  




 Unclinch your bums, guys and gals!  




 [Pagan looking like he stepped right out of a telenovela.](http://i.imgur.com/YxXI9Yh.jpg) 




 Should have pushed it fair, jerk.  




 Looks freezing there. For once, I'm glad I'm not in the crowd.  




 We'll probably have to choose between Vogey and Peavy, which is an easy choice.  




 The biggest surprise of the address for me was the way the president talked about the Assad regime. He said the regime will never regain the legitimacy that they have lost. I don't necessarily disagree with that, but I'm surprised to hear the president write the regime off as a potential ally against ISIS.

Assad is in control of an entire air force, and what seems to be a more organized military than the rebels. I would not have been shocked to see the US reluctantly side with Assad in exchange for his assistance in going after ISIS. The language the President used tonight rules that possibility out.  




 The biggest change from what we've already been doing is we are now expanding the air strikes to Syria. 




 I'm just going on memory, so take this with a grain of salt, but he stated his plan to:


1. Begin air strikes in Syria.

2. Arm the enemies of ISIS, including moderate Syrian rebel groups.

3. Send 400+ more troops to Iraq in non-combat roles.  




 I'm sorry, but this just isn't correct. Just because they commit horrendous crimes doesn't mean they aren't religious. They certainly don't represent the majority of Muslims, but it's not accurate to say that they aren't religious. I think we can be mature enough to criticize a terrorist group without attacking an entire religion.  









 It just went final in San Francisco.  




 Padres now up 6-2 with a runner on 2nd with 1 out.  




 Joe Panik. So hot right now. Joe Panik.  




 Padres have runners on the corners with no outs.  




 Petit pitching like he has somewhere to be after the game.  




 They can have the MVP, we'll take the division.  




 I read that they are only ~5 games over .500 in games when Kershaw doesn't pitch. That's the best argument for Kershaw winning the MVP I've heard yet.  




 A Dodger fan in r/baseball summed up my exact thoughts about LA in a thread last night. They're winning games, but there's something not quite right about them. I think they're vulnerable and I wouldn't be surprised if they struggle in the final 3 weeks. 




 Panik is a stud.  




 Loved watching him play at Notre Dame. It's a shame his game didn't carry over into the NBA.  




 Najera?  




 Stole this idea from r/baseball. 


I'll start. Keon Clark. I just looked him up and last year he was sentenced to 8 years in prison for weapons charges. He also claims to have never played a game sober in his NBA career.  




 Finally, that city has something to be proud of other than a two ingredient sandwich and a fictional boxer. 




 I remember when Noah Lowry and Jerome Williams looked like they were both going to be studs for us.  




 A three quarter triangle? What an idiot. 




 One more touchdown and the Cowboys will cover the spread. With these refs, I wouldn't be surprised.  




 Week one and I'm already reminded what annoyed me about the NFL last year: Ticky tack penalties and so many commercials.  




 Geno is looking LEGIT! Surprise of the day so far.  




 Especially impressive considering he was batting in the .280s a month ago. He's been on another level lately.  




 The steak ends at 46 after a 1 out double. 


Mark Buehrle's ML record was set in 2009. The previous NL record of 41, which Petit also broke today, was set by Jim Barr in 1972. 
 




 I'm watching Parks and Rec and seeing how out of shape Chris Pratt is in season 1. That makes his recent transformation all the more impressive. Do you have a favorite actor/actress body transformation?  




 I know, I know I hate posts here where OP makes excuses too.

I'm staying at my parents' house for a few months. My dad has a bench. So, I can do bench, DLs, rows. He also has dumbbells and a pullup bar, so I can do dumbbell press and pullups. Everything I need to build a strong upper body is there. The problem is, he doesn't have a way to safely squat. The only thing he has for lower body is a leg extension/leg curl machine attached to the bench. 

What kind of results can I expect to my lower body if I combine that with dumbbel lunges? Are there any other lower body exercises I can do with the equipment I have?  




 It seems like the general consensus around here is that deadlifts are the single best lift you can do. I'm wondering what your body would look like if you only did deadlifts. 



















 I thought it would be a good idea if, once a week, we had a weekly discussion thread where we could discuss anything.

My question to you: What sporting events do you have your eyes on over the MLB all-star break? 

I ended the first half of the season with a perfect day, betting on SF, CIN, TB, ATL and LAA. Nothing like having a perfect day and then not having baseball for the next few days.

What's on your mind this week? 









 I'm reading *The Master and Margarita* right now. I'm only about half way through, but I think Woland should be played by Johnny Depp in a role similar to Willy Wonka or Jack Sparrow; obviously intelligent, but a little spacey, although you're never quite sure if it's an act or not.  Ivan would be played by a younger actor. Maybe someone like Heath Ledger.  




 There was a thread recently about classics that have not aged well and I'm curious about the opposite. What classic books have aged well? 









 I just read it for the first time and while it was a decent story, it didn't strike me as exceptional in any way. Why is it so famous almost 100 years after it was written? 









 I just landed this morning and immediately did the Freedom Trail. I'll be here until Thursday night and I'm looking for suggestions from locals for activities to do. I definitely want to catch a game at Fenway either tonight or tomorrow. I also want to go to a brewery. I know Sam Adams is the famous one, but I've heard good things about Harpoon. What else do you recommend I do? 









 I have always wanted to do this and I'll probably never get a better chance to do it than next month. I had some travel plans with a friend that fell through, so I have a week off work. More importantly, I can fly for free or nearly free through a family member who works for an airline. If you've done it before, what was your experience like? What advice can you share? 




 Right now I weigh 165 lbs @ 5'10". I included lifts at 3 different weights: 135, 185, 200. Just want to make sure I'm not headed towards a preventable injury. Please take a look and let me know how I can improve.

 I'm constantly wondering how I'm going to get my next meal. I wake up in the morning and I try to remember how much food is in the house. How much milk do I have and is it enough to make it through the day? When will I find time to go to the store today to get more milk for tomorrow? Did I remember to wash my blender last night? Is today lifting day? I think about how many calories I need to have consumed by the time I leave for work, because I know I will be too tired to cook a big meal when I come home. I don't want to be hungry at work, but I also don't want protein farts. I lay in bed browsing reddit on my phone, but I know I should be eating.

If I start to feel hungry at work, I fret over the gains I'm losing. I count the minutes until I can take my break and find some food. But I only have 15 minutes. I run to Starbucks and hope they have breakfast sandwiches left. That will have to hold me over for the rest of my shift. 


I come home feeling tired, but I can't go to bed until I hit my caloric goal. I debate whether I have the energy to cook a full meal or if I should just piece away at some milk and snacks for a bit. I choose the latter. I hit my goal for the day, but at what cost? I now have almost nothing left for the following day. If today was a struggle, tomorrow will only be harder. I look at my shirtless body in the mirror as I brush my teeth. I'm tired and bloated, but goddammit if I don't look bigger. 









 Pretty dark, but could be funny if done right. 














 Brothers and sisters in swole, like many of you, I didn't think it could happen to me. I read your stories of swolestation and felt the same rage you felt, but I thought I was safe. Surely those around me appreciate me for my personality, I believed. Yet, yesterday, at my own place of employment no less, I was used like some piece of farm equipment.

I'm relatively new to the Iron Path, but Brodin has been very good to me. I've noticed the stealthy glances of passersby as they 'mire my aesthetics, but I can take that because I also consider myself swole of spirit. But what happened yesterday was more than I can bare.

My work has conducted a food drive over the last two months to collect food for the less fortunate. I was extra motivated, as I saw this as an opportunity to give the aspiring followers of Brodin the fuel they need to make mad gains. Our store was very successful in our efforts and yesterday, we finally delivered the boxes of food to the food closet on the other side of town. There were dozens of boxes, many filled with canned goods. 

Without warning or asking me if I wanted to help, my boss informed me yesterday that she "needed my muscles" to help her deliver the food. I was dumbfounded. I've always tried to be the best employee I could be, but suddenly I found myself as nothing more than a tool to help move nonperishable food items. I have never felt so objectified. 

I sat in silence next to my boss on the car ride over as I tried my best to contain my tears. When we finally arrived, I did my best to deliver the boxes as quickly as possible so I could return to work and have a good think in the break room. As soon as the last box was set down, the food closet manager said perkily, "We sure are lucky to have you. Otherwise we would have been moving boxes all afternoon." Do you believe the nerve? She didn't even consider the possibility that the previous day was deadlift day and maybe lifting heavy boxes off the ground wasn't ideal for me. 

I'm at a loss, reddit. I thought my place of employment was my sanctuary. What should I do? 




 I'm not the most devout worshipper of Brodin, but I have paid my dues at the Iron Temple regularly this year, and have been blessed with righteous gains. I've been swolested on a couple of occasions, but I forgive those people, for they know not the error of their ways. The pain that their actions caused me was erased after an experience yesterday at work.


An unruly customer, neither swole of body or mind, threatened my boss after she banned him from the store. This was the third time she has had to ask him to leave and each time he has made a scene while exiting. Unfortunately, I was not present to witness the events as they happened that day, but they worried my boss. As the day went on and she resumed normal work activity, she needed to go to her car to get something. Although I was the youngest man working that day, it was me she asked to walk with her for protection. Brodin gave me this opportunity to use my gains for good. I escorted her to and from her car without incident. Although my presence was unnecessary, it felt good to be asked to provide protection.
