 link? 




 Thanks for sharing, looks awesome :). Mine is your typical 4x4 :( lol 




 Hey guys, I love Rust. Primarily base building. However I'm not too great at making something that looks awesome. Anyone care to share what theirs looks like? Or know of any sites that show how to guides etc for sweet base layouts? Thanks :P 




 fuck that, did it on normal already 




 Would love to see decklists :) 




 Thanks for the info! Bought it today and played a little Altis Life xD. Although I had no idea what to do lol 




 When you go to multiplayer do you simply type in Altis life or you need a specific server address to type in which then downloads the appropriate files? I've been waiting to get this for like 6 months I'm praying its on sale today! lol 




 Waiting on the 50% off too, was so sad when it lost the community vote lol :(. Need to play that Altis life 3. I heard it's built right into the game now so you don't need to download anything additional is that true? 




 It worked, thanks! 




 Any ideas people? I can't even use the "ESC" key.
