 Sounds like you need to let go. If she wasn't interested in you in that way, her opinion isn't going to change by you just convincing her. D-Bag move by your buddy though, I think you could use a new friend AND a new love interest. 




 Who/what is 'itmejp'? 




 That /r/giants pre-game shot was the essence of rivalry. 




 Pretend you're with people you ARE comfortable with, whether that's close friends or certain family members. They're probably a bit nervous about hanging with you- be the one that reaches out. Think of it as an opportunity to make a valuable, unique connection. 




 Does it bother anyone else that there's zero split-screen capability for both campaign AND multiplayer? 




 Any suggestions to a specific product would be most appreciated.

Thanks! 




 I did the train show on Friday night had a fantastic time. 




 So much for having a productive day at the office... 




 Read samples of each book on Amazon (Google Books most likely has them too). Everyone has a different taste for style of writing, and when it comes to research everyone absorbs material differently. Spend 5-10 minutes on each book and see what sticks. 




 Better experience with e-ink. 




 Dune. Can't believe it took me this long to read that brilliance. 




 It may be my favorite book as well. There's never been something so long that I've become so completely engrossed in. A lot of it has to do with being an American and already being intrigued by Japanese culture- that was the case for me and I'm sure a lot of Clavell lovers.

Just like the protagonist, the reader finds him/herself washed ashore in a strange land with an entirely new lifestyle and mindset that permeate throughout all the inhabitants. And as you read on, these feudal Japanese concepts make more sense, become less foreign, and just like the hero you find yourself falling in love with this way of life.

This is a tremendous adventure book, a tremendous history book, and a tremendous spiritual book. So happy for you to have had the pleasure of reading it.  




 I used to have the same issue as you, SO frustrating!

I read on a kindle so they track your progress a percentage. In order to read a book in a week's time, I need at least 17% a day. I set a goal every day to reach that amount, and it commits me to the book. Obviously I don't always stick to this but over the past couple years it's worked out well.

If you prefer raw doggin it with real books just make it 30 pages or a chapter, whatever your comfortable with. Best of luck- 




 From RA Salvatore I'd move to some Raymond E Feist, start with the Riftwar Saga. Robert Jordan's wheel of time is excellent, but very long. A Song of Ice and Fire is the best as far as I'm concerned, but is lacking in a lot of the traditional fantasy elements. For something weird and challenging The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe. David Eddings has written a lot of great fantasy, for him start with Pawn of Prophecy. And of course, Lord of The Rings. 




 This is probably the best advice I've ever give anyone: Don't see the ball drop. Spend hours in the freezing cold, you can't leave to go to the bathroom, can't leave to get food or drinks, and no room whatsoever. 




 I want to be in that moment right now.
 




 Might try the Belgariad series by David Eddings. I've read a good bit and fantasy and typically do find romance to be a lacking element. I read a couple books into this series a long time ago and remember there to be some high quality romance written. Might be best to read some more opinions on it as my memory is fairly cloudy about this.

A Song of Ice and Fire also has some great romance now that I think on it. 




 Look up "sell books" on Yelp in your area 




 Haha enjoy! 




 Judge for yourself, but I think without question. Many of the main and most popular characters are female. Here's a pretty humorous quote that gets thrown around a lot- http://imgur.com/nu2Mipb

The books are fantastic. I'd be surprised if you read 30ish pages into the first one without being hooked. 




 How'd the cops get tipped off? 




 Packers- Let's be honest they're probably screwed anyway without A-Rod steering the ship. They're gonna have to run it all game, ATL has a soft run defense, ATL's passing attack will be diminished by the weather.

I'd say it benefits the Pack the most because a) They're desperate for a win and b) I don't think they can win this game without this edge. 




 There's a ton of businesses in this country that give out loans to people like you. Interest rates are more lucrative for them but A LOT of businesses get started this way. If you're in a major city there's certainly some available.

Here is one that I'm familiar with - http://www.nextlevelfunding.com/

Being able to overcome failure is what truly defines a person's character. Sounds like you're quite motivated and I'm sure you have a bright future. Best of luck. 




 What do those characters translate to?

Great drawing! 




 I mean this in a nice way, because you seem like a hard worker and a good person, but you're being a 'pussy' in this relationship. You deserve better. She sounds like a bad person. You're young, spend some time apart and meet someone that appreciates you. Are you happy? Because there are women out there that will make you actually happy- toxic relationships don't allow for that. 




 How much debt do you have exactly? Have you considered community college- why do you think you were unsuccessful at school?

Your first step, without question has to be losing weight. It's something that's entirely in your control and will only open up more options for you down the road, aside from making you feel substantially better about yourself. r/loseit and r/fitness are invaluable resources for this. 




 Thoroughly enjoyed reading this- you've got a talent for writing sci-fi hope you stick with it! 




 Sorry for the bad advice! Thanks for informing me, though. Looks like I was completely in the dark on my egg info and need to do more reading up on it.

I still stand by my beans, great inexpensive high protein option. 




 Have you tried A Song of Ice and Fire? 




 Might want to cut down on those yolks for starters, that's what going to mainly affect your cholesterol and egg whites will give you plenty of protein.

Beans, lentils, tuna fish, peanut butter, and nuts- all great sources. If you can find some organic low sodium canned beans, they are an excellent healthy and inexpensive option- and pack a great deal of protein. 




 You haven't really talked about why it is you want to get married so bad. Could you shed some light on this? 




 Been reading up on Little, Big and have to say I am thoroughly intrigued- I can't believe it received so many awards and I'm not familar with it. Have you read anything else by Wolfe? I was looking into his other pieces and thinking of picking up The Death of Doctor Island. 




 Dude's practically begging to get his dick grabbed. 




 Ice skating in Bryant park, walking around Central Park, botanical gardens in the Bronx, there's a lot of great bars with fireplaces that are nice to hang out at, Bryant Park and Union Square will be filled to the brim with small shops that are great to find gifts at. 




 Shogun and pretty much anything else by James Clavell. 




 Once those interior D-Linemen started getting injured that run defense was screwed. I remember the Giants went into that week 6 game with arguably the worst rushing offense in the league, Bears made Brandon Jacobs look like AP. 




 This guy also did a Ted talk I enjoyed, basically the same subject- 

Aubrey de Grey: A roadmap to end aging via @TEDiSUB
http://www.ted.com/talks/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_aging.html 




 You could use that app in conjunction with r/writingprompts.

It'd be great to have an app that rewarded you with points and had an rpg/experience system. 




 The Master and the Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov is a weird russian novel. If you're looking for fantasy, The Book of the New Sun series is a tomb but it's a weird challenging-but-rewarding read.

When I was having a tough time I became completely engulfed in Shogun by James Clavell. Very easy to disappear into that book if you need to, I'd recommend this one the most. 




 Whole Foods has truly conquered this dillema. 




 I'd say it'll most certainly get better in your calves as long as you continue running. If October was your first half it makes sense for them to not be used to such an undertaking. Hard to give a timetable, but as long as you keep at it they'll become stronger and more durable. 




 Awesome. 




 I started trying a few weeks ago and have also been encountering difficulties. What method have you been using primarily? 




 Yeah but their post-game rates range from $5,000 to $7,500. 




 Saints- after a loss like that against the Seahawks, Sean 'Vendetta' Payton is gonna show the world what kind of hell his offense can truly raise. Would love to see panthers win this though, that team's been a tremendous story this year. 




 If he decides to stay after next year, why in the world would he want out of Denver? He's been put into a dream situation- things would not be going as smoothly if he had signed with Arizona or Miami. I also don't see another owner in the nfl that can relate to his quarterback as well as Elway does. 




 Turns out he wasn't real. 




 You won't have to read that far, and fortunately for you the movie changed many fundamental aspects of the book so not too much will be ruined. It's a tremendous trilogy, definitely worth reading (Book 2 is my favorite).

Try to just get lost in the book, the world Pullman creates is very intriguing. I've read the first one twice and both times feel as though I'm on my own adventure exploring this strange alternate world that Lyra and her companions occupy.
 




 Off the top of my head:

Science Fiction: Hyperion by Dan Simmons and Dune by Frank Herbert (Both are the first books in a series).

Historical Fiction: Shogun by James Clavell, First Man in Rome by Colleen McCullough, and pretty much anything by Michael Crichton.

Fantasy: Wheel of Time Series and Book of the New Sun

"Classic" Authors: Mark Twain, Dostoyevsky, Dickens, and Kafka (These are the ones I'm personally most familiar with, obviously there's many more of excellent quality out there).

EDIT: I realized these are just books that I personally liked. There's tons of lists out there by people more well-read, just google it up. This list from Esquire pointed me in a great direction a while ago: http://www.esquire.com/the-side/feature/80-books#slide-1 




 Anyone else peer down at their legs in shame after watching this? 




 I always felt that students were turned off to literature courses due to the intimidating length of so many of these books. Someone who's never read 400+ page book recreationally is going to avoid one of these courses at all costs- and rightly so! That kind of inexperience would make reading one of those take up way too much time. This doesn't lessen the content in any way, if anything you dig more out of the text by having a smaller area of study. 




 This was a huge help for me as far as personal finance:

http://www.amazon.com/Get-Financial-Life-Personal-Twenties-ebook/dp/B001UP63MS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8 qid=1386187208 sr=8-3 keywords=personal+finance 




 Are they looking for something different, exciting? Then absolutely.

The main issue with SNM is a lot of the situations are going to make you uncomfortable, and your experience is going to be entirely a product of what kind of attitude you have.

Yes it's going to get weird, that's what make's it such a unique experience. If it's not embraced though, I can see them having a bad time. 




 Thanks!

I've been considering Jailbreaking my iPad for a while and this re-lit the fire a bit. I'll have to do some research on how this would be handled. 




 Magnifies how awful the film was for not portraying any of this to a casual audience. 




 This seems to have been an impactful injury this season. I haven't really been following this team, has this played a serious role in their offense struggles this year? How has his replacement performed? 




 Depends, what part of the city you gonna be in?

If you're gonna be near midtown I'd recommend The Football Factory (33rd St between Broadway and 5th). 




 If you think this person would enjoy Historical Fiction, two books I can't recommend enough are:

The First Man in Rome by Colleen Mccullough

and

Shogun by James Clavell 




 I'm new to using Mods such as this- Is this something that can be used on a Jail-broken Tablet or is this PC-exclusive? 




 Some of the best Sci-Fi ever written. 




 American Psycho. A tremendous satire on the Wall Street/Yuppie culture that permeated the elite class of new york city in the 1980s....and some of the most disturbing passages you will ever read. If you've got a weak stomache, the last 1/3 of this book should be avoided. 




 Something that helped me tremendously was Sperm Wars by Robin Baker. Keep in mind this is written by a biologist, but it teaches you how men/women are innately wired and why we act the way we do. In my opinion profoundly more helpful than a lot of these typical dating/pick up artist guides.

http://www.amazon.com/Sperm-Wars-Infidelity-Conflict-Bedroom-ebook/dp/B0046A8SEU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1386179569 sr=8-1 keywords=sperm+wars
 




 For something more on the traditional side, I'd recommend anything by Raymond E. Feist. Best to start with the Riftwar Saga and the book Magician.

For something more challenging/pretty weird, I'd recommend The Book of the New Sun series by Gene Wolfe. 




 I'm not sure if there's a website/database that has the information- couldnt find it on my own. Anyone have thoughts? Main concern is this Brown/Patriots game coming up. Have a feeling Amendola is going to catch a big nut on Sunday.

Thoughts?
