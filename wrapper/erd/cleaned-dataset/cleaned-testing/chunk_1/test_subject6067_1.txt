 I make them at home! 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream + milk (add as much or as little depending on thickness of milkshake desired *I add 1/2 cup) + about 1/8tsp of peppermint extract.  You can add green food coloring if you'd like. 




 I'm embarassed to admit that I've fallen asleep like this before... 




 Gambling, especially in Vegas.  Slot machines..no desire to play them at all. 




 I don't believe that you should always take something just cause it's free... 




 Sorry to hear about your breakup :( I don't have a lot of advice on this topic since I don't know you or your situation, but I know that you'll be ok.  It probably sucks big time right now... but watch some good movies, eat some good food, and just treat yourself like a king while you ride this whole thing out :D 




 I do some light cleaning around the kitchen while I wait for the microwave to finish heating up my food.  Hot food and less mess in the kitchen... Win! 




 I think she seems really nice, really pretty, has a great body, but she seems like a bit of a fame whore and she really can't sing.  Benjy and Elisa seem perfect for each other.. both very delusional.. LOL

 I can send some asian candies if you'd like to exchange with me!  I'm in Los Angeles and can get lots of stuff here.  Let me know if you're interested :D 




 Agreed.. plus nothing is more refreshing than iced tea!  I use Stevia in my tea and coffee so I don't have to worry about sugar either.
 




 Agreed :)  But it also depends on how you ask the question... so there's a big difference between " HEY! YOU GOTTA BF?GF????" and " So are you dating anyone currently?".. all about delivery. 




 Avocado + soy sauce + fresh minced garlic... or if you want something sweet... avocado + sugar + milk .. blended with ice.. AMAZING! 




 Bacon anyone? 




 Croc + Eagle = talons/flight/teeth... scarrryyyyy 




 Maybe it's just all the liquid you're drinking that's helping you eat less... 









 Omg... Walls, seat, handle??  Ehhhhh poor janitor....  I'd expect that to happen in the men's restroom, but I've seen some disgusting toilets in the women's restroom.   




 People that use the public restroom and not flush after they do their business.  Ehh the stuff I've seen... Lol

 Darn I just removed the URLS using webmaster tools the other day.  I'm not sure how long it takes for google to change it.  I guess if I don't see a change I'll try the 301.  Thank you SquareWheel. 




 her non-watermarked pictures... :D lol 




 hm... I do see what you mean... 




 That's what I'm thinking as well... but I do wonder how much extra traffic it actually would add if I did...

 Hey guys, I have a small photoblog where I post photos from travel, things I make, etc..  Recently I've found photos of mine on tumblrs, and other wordpress blogs.  I'm complimented that they'd like it..but should I be watermarking my photos so that i get a little extra traffic?  What are your opinions? 




 Hi guys!  When I launched my photoblog, I had a few extra categories which I deleted within a few days.  Now that it's been almost 2 months since my wordpress blog has been up, google search and  webmasters tools are still showing those deleted categories.  I've submitted my sitemap since the initial category deletion, but it hasn't worked.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you! 




 I posted it as soon as he left... so at the time it did just happen lol. 




 The UPS guy just stared at me, I smiled having no idea his name was Neil...  Then after i signed for the package, he asks me for my dog's name and explains why he was confused.  Then I just went.. "oh.. Hehehehe" 









 Posted this before, but this is how we torture our whippet when he wants to sleep on the couch with us lol http://i.imgur.com/eKZFy.jpg
