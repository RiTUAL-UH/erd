 Hey I had one of these once, used it at BK and the cashier just looked at it for about 10 seconds!  




 Put a mustache on it 




 Norwich is great for exploring! We have tons of stuff! 




 It sounds like someone who isn't into bisexual girls. I mean take what you want from it, but it's me. My profile said something similar to "I'm intimidated by bisexual girls." I got rid of it, but I never once said I'm not scared of anyone who has had homosexual relationships. Me saying I'm intimidated is my way of saying I would be nervous to be with a girl who has been with other girls. If you want to be uptight and get offended by this then so be it. Saying that just because I have my profile set to straight girls only is a sign I may have other "illogical beliefs" is the most ridiculous thing I've heard in a while. Why don't you bring this up with okcupid who has that setting allowed? Do something constructive with how you feel instead of targeting one person. That's the problem with a lot of people these days. So many would rather harass someone over something silly than actually do something about it.  




 Sounds good, I'll take care of it. Thank you! 




 Nothing, honestly. It's just I don't know how I would feel dating a bisexual girl. It certainly isn't homophobic, but if you feel like it is then that's fine.  




 Well if someone was reading my profile first before going into the detail section I would think they would remember I'm in college. 




 I'll take it. Thank you!  




 Thanks. I deleted a few pictures and and I'll try to get more real pictures. 




 College student working part time. Sorry. 









 Nice!

 As long as it isn't a black light, no secrets will be revealed!  




 I get severe goosebumps whenever I see a trailer for this movie!  




 What sort of beautiful display can you make out of butt plugs?  




 I always say sorry and laugh when I do this 




 Shit happens.  




 I feel good when something on WTF makes me want to vomit.  




 Damn it... You're right! Success comes from mistakes though, and I am excited for these new successes!  




 So happy this guy never left! Shabazz you're a UCONN hero, win or lose!  




 Haha I really hope that we are relevant. With MCW and a healthy Noel(fingers crossed) all we need is a legit scorer and we should be relevant! 




 FUCK THE NEW JERSEY NETS AND THE BOSTON CELTICS AND THE NEW YORK KNICKS! 76ERS ALL DAY MOTHERFUCKER! FEEL OUR WRATH IN 2 YEARS THUNDERCUNTS!  




 Most beautiful city I've ever been to. 




 Explain that all that beastiality porn is for science! 

Edit: bestiality. I'm keeping the original and thank you for the correction!  




 Pass out in a comfortable chair. 




 I sleep for 23 hours. 




 I would guess it sort of depends on where you live and what your career is in.  




 I think you mean Kabletown. 




 Wow. I never noticed that they're the same person. What a world! 




 So I notice that a lot of girls say don't send me a message saying just "Hey", give it some effort. Every single first message I have received from a girl has been a simple "Hey" or a variation of hey such as "Hey cutie" or "Hi". What's up with this double standard? Why can girls say hey, but males get shunned for saying hey? 




 Good man. Good luck tonight and here's an up vote to you having a wonderful life with her! 




 You know why you want to marry this person?  




 I would say CT is a solid 25th best state in the country.  




 I'll try to get more non selfies. It's tough, I don't like pictures. 
Also that's an anchorman quote... I feel like it's amazing. 




 I've had this account for awhile now. This is account number two actually. My username is drannen126, I'm just looking for some constructive feedback! Thanks! 




 Yeah true. I might as well make some banter when I see her randomly. It's the thought of talking to a person I don't know. Once I do it I'm fine.  




 Well... you know... that would involve me...  having confidence... which I don't have. 




 Just take it super slow this time of year. I try not to get involved with people in December, January and February. I just don't like the idea of spending money on a person I haven't been together with for a decent amount of time.  
I'll still chat people up during these months, but I'll take it slow and just keep my options open. Don't totally become a hermit. Just be that neighbor who talks about the weather when you're both picking up your newspaper.  




 Oh, I will.  




 I'm glad I saw this thread. I work next to a Target and there is this girl I see on OKCupid and she also works at Target. I'm nervous to message her because I go to Target almost everyday and I want to avoid being awkward. Screw it. I might go and message her now! 




 I saw this while taking a dump before a class at my college.
