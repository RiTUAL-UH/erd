 Nope :( 




 Guys this has been bothering me for a while. I was watching The Usual Suspects and Kevin Pollock reminded me of this actor. He is short (I think), white, has curly hair and I think a receding hairline. For some reason I associate him with a cigar, Joe Pesci and an Academy Award. I think he is smiling wide in his IMDB page. Please please help me out :) 

Edit: GUYS GUYS GUYS: IT IS GARY SINISE (LT.DAN)
I LOVE YOU ALL!
