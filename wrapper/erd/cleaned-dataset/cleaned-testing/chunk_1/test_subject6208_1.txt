 Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, but I have some vinyls I've gotten from my grandmother and would love to listen to them, but I don't own a record player. I don't even know where to start and what to look for. Can someone help me find a good starter record player for under $150? 




 Okay, so I made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hwb6k/what_are_some_good_movies_to_show_to_a_group_of/) a few days ago looking for help figuring out what movie to watch on our movie night. 

After looking at the comments, and comparing them to the movies I actually own, I've put together a list of seven movies. However, I can't decide which to watch. In the original post, I talked about what my friends liked. "They don't like slow paced movies and would rather not watch a drama unless its interesting and has good pace. They like just about any genre but would prefer either a horror, comedy, action or any combination of those. I think above all though the thing that matters most is if its interesting and has good pacing. I don't want to bore them. I showed them There Will Be Blood once and I could feel the awkward boredom in the room."

The List: Pulp Fiction, Event Horizon, Fight Club, Children of Men, Dredd, Crank, and Se7en.

So which of these would be the best crowd pleaser? The one everyone would be most likely to enjoy? Which is the easiest to get into, no matter what kinds of movies you like? 














 Looking for a great sci-fi horror movie to watch. I love sci-fi but I also want to be horrified, terrified, grossed out, etc

Any ideas? 




 So me and some friends are doing a movie night Friday and I'm trying to figure out what to show. 

A little info on my friends. They don't like slow paced movies and would rather not watch a drama unless its interesting and has good pace. They like just about any genre but would prefer either a horror, comedy, action or any combination of those. I think above all though the thing that matters most is if its interesting and has good pacing. I don't want to bore them. I showed them There Will Be Blood once and I could feel the awkward boredom in the room. 

Also I'd prefer something that didn't come out in the last two years. Thanks guys!

I watched this not knowing what to expect and was immediately drawn in by its animation style. Tells a very interesting story about a selfish morally corrupted man who one day wakes up with wings on his back. I was really amazed by not only the animation but also how it tells this story with no dialogue. It even gets a little Cronenberg-y at some parts. Definitely give it a watch.   




 Lets fantasize for a minute here. Lets say that there is no way it will be bad. That they will get everything right and it will do justice to the original show. That it will without a doubt be great. 

And I'm not talking about a remake of a show. I'm talking about a sort of continuation of the show. I'm talking about something like the Rugrats Movie, Simpsons Movie, Serenity, and Arrested Development. 

So what tv shows would you like to see get a movie? 




 I mean he's so good with creature effects and Pacific Rim sort of reminds me of Power Rangers in a way. Just a thought.  




 For example, I hope Aaron Paul makes the jump to film because he's a great actor that should get more roles.  




 Saw White House Down then I went to a casino and I was wondering what games have levels that take place at a casino or the White House? 




 I really love the Mardi Gras level in Hitman Blood Money. It was probably the first time I saw that many NPCs in one level. 




 What are some really good flying games for this current generation of consoles?

First time posting here. My friend and I decided to challenge ourselves and see what we could come up with in only 24 hours. Would love some feedback. We loved our idea so much that we'd like to make a full length film of it some day so, criticisms, tips, and suggestions are more than welcomed! 




 I'm really interested in seeing this but I can't find out where it's being released at. On my local theaters website they have a list of movies they'll be showing up to middle August but Only God Forgives isn't listed so I'm assuming my local theater isn't showing it. 

Anyone know where it'll be? 









 I'm not talking about a movie being turned into a stage play. What I mean is, what if the movie was shot as a musical.  




 I have some khakis that need altering.  




 I love Nine Inch Nails and think they're great, but even if they weren't great, Nine Inch Nails is such a cool name. 









 Also what items are they? 



















 So my friend got me into World of Tanks and while we were setting it up we started talking about the voice chat in the game, or any pc game in general, and thought it be cool to have some sort of voice modulator software, where whenever we talk, people hear like a delocated, super low voice. For example, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=YlxxxXz4T-s#t=16s)

So my question is, is there any software that can do this?

Again, if this isn't the right place, please tell me where I can ask this, thanks, guys! 




 Loved Just Cause 2 and was wondering if anyone's said anything about it at E3 this year. 




 [Picture](http://imgur.com/yrLLfCQ)

My friend is moving away this week and I wanted to give her a photo of all of us. The problem is that it was taken on an iphone so it's super fuzzy and grainy and the quality isn't that great.

Could someone improve the coloring to make it less yellow and more "natural" looking? Also is it possible to make it clearer or less grainy? Just an overall better looking picture?

I really appreciate any help. We just want our friend to have a nice picture of all of us all.

Edit: Thank you /u/screwball2 and /u/braceyourself87 these are great! I really appreciate it! 




 I'm talking about some not so well known directors that have only done a few movies, or they can even be well known directors that make movies every so often.

My pick is Gaspar Noe. Dude makes great movies, but he's only done a few and hasn't made one since 2009. 




 Me and some friends are going to have a movie night tonight. We want to see something sick and disturbing. Almost all of us, including me, are very squeamish so we thought it'd be fun to be grossed out.

I wanna know what the most disturbing, gruesome and grisly gore you've seen in a movie is. I'm not talking about someone getting shot and blood sprays out. I'm talking head crushing, bone breaking, gut spilling out sort of things. 




 What scene of violence or gore in a movie has made you cringe the hardest? 




 I watched Kill List recently and really liked it. I liked how it starts off pretty standard but as the movie progresses, things start getting darker, stranger, and more evil.

Are there any other good movies that start off pretty standard, but throughout the course of the movie things just get darker, more evil, more insane, stranger, and just all out worse? 

Like the protagonist is totally sane at the start, but throughout the movie he experiences things that get increasingly unsettling, violent, dark, and evil and by the time the movie is over he is a different, emotionally and mentally broken man. Anything like that?

Edit: Requiem for a Dream is a good example of what I'm talking about. 




 I'm looking for some good mature adult graphic novels. But not mature as in violent or gory. Mature as in language and subject matter. Basically an R rated comedy in graphic novel form. Something funny, but also very adult and mature. Anything that fits the bill? 




 I can't remember the title. It was something along the lines of "Getting drunk in front of the movie theater" or something like that? It was about a young adult girl? I read a little bit of this novel a while ago and liked it but don't remember what it was called.  




 I'm looking for some graphic novels to read that are realistic. As in, they're about real, normal people. Not super heroes. Not zombies. Not monsters. Just regular average Joes or average Janes. 

One of my favorite graphic novels is Daytripper. It's about a guy and his life from his childhood all the way to his adulthood. No superheros or supernatural stuff. Just a guy and his experiences in life.

Or some good heist graphic novels, or cop novels, detective novels, war novels, or even just novels about a person or group of people. Basically graphic novels about people who aren't superhuman. They're just like you and me.

As much as I think superheros are cool, I'm just fascinated with human drama. Human interactions. Human problems.

I hope I explained well enough. If you need more details and information about what I'm looking for, just let me know. 




 What are some great graphic novels that aren't well known? 









 Also, what would you do?

I choose link karma instead of comment karma or combining the two because it'd get ridiculously high.

Mine is 1961, so I guess it'd be interesting. 




 It was a post withe the title "Whoever wins this game..." or something like that. It was about a game that drops you into google streetview and you have to make your way to an airport. Tried looking for it but it seems like the post just disappeared. Anyone know where it is or what game it was? 




 When people talk about funniest movies, they tend to talk about movies made in the 20th century. So what do you think are the funniest movies of the 21st century? 




 I'm getting sick of long hair and since it's summer I'm thinking of getting a haircut. But I don't know where to go. I know MHA says to stay away from places like Super Cuts. So where should I go? Salon? Barber? Hair studio? What kind of place is best to get a good stylish and fashionable haircut? 









 It can be a character, too. Just any famous person or character. 




 I was looking for a vinyl of The Fragile and someone mention they heard there was going to be a repress of it? Is this true? If it is, when? And if it is, does this mean I can finally get The Fragile vinyl at a reasonable price?

 I'm working on losing weight. I have a diet set up and I'm starting to run. However, I know that weight lifting is an important part of losing weight and getting in shape. So my question is: As someone who can't afford a gym membership or weights, what is a good substitute for weights? A box of books? What DIY stuff can I bench press or curl? 




 Basically what mom and/or dad from a movie or tv show would be cool to have? Why? You can mix and match mom and dads from any movie or tv show to make awesome combinations of parents if you want.  




 Everybody's bashing the new Xbox talking about, "Oh it looks like a VCR! Hurhur!" But I actually think its kind of sexy. I like the simple sleek design of it. It seems like its built for efficiency. And besides, when it comes down to it, the look of the console is near the bottom of the list of things that matter. 




 What do you consider a must see movie simply because of what they achieve or do on a technical level(music, camera work, sound, cgi, effects, cinematography, etc.)? Regardless of how good you think the movie actually is in terms of acting or writing or story. 

For example, Enter the Void is a movie many would consider bad or boring and not that great. However, I think it's a must see purely because of what they achieve with the camera work and cinematography.

Also, Avatar. Many like it, but there are also many who don't think it's that great and has a bland story and average acting, but I also consider it a must see because of its groundbreaking effects.

So what movies do you think are must sees from a technical standpoint? 




 So yeah. People tell me it's great, but have never told me why. All they say is, "It's great man. Just give it a shot." "What's great about it?" "Just watch it."

So no one as ever really argued for it or given me reasons why I'd like it. I like fantasy stuff. And I appreciate a great story with great characters. But I have a hard time looking past the fact that it's animated and about kids.

But like I said, no one has ever given me reasons why I should watch it and what makes it great. I want to check it out, and I'm open minded,  but I can't convince myself because I know nothing about it. So, change my view. 




 So I've been trying to convince my mother to watch this show for a while now. I know she'd love it because she loves these types of shows. But she won't give it a chance because it's animated and that automatically makes it a "little kids show." So can you guys help me develop an argument to convince her to at least give it a shot? How did you convince someone you know to watch it? 




 Disturbing or terrifying videos/audio recordings are welcomed too. Basically things that just don't sit right with you and you find unsettling. 




 As someone with social anxiety who's also super shy, this situation makes me want to die. 




 I have social anxiety and this situation makes me want to die.  









 It takes me about three months for my facial hair to resemble anything close to a beard. Is there any way to speed this process up? Rogaine on my face? Anything? 



















 Basically a subreddit where people post awesome fan made trailers and mashups. Combining other trailers. Also creating tv show intro mashups. 




 I hate Betty White. But it's not her fault. It's everyone else's fault. She so overrated. Everyone's like "OMG Betty White is the funniest person! She's the greatest! She's so much win! I love her so much!" Honestly she's just humorous. Don't get me wrong, she's a kind person. But I absolutely hate that everyone goes nuts for Betty White. It seems like whenever she's in a movie or show, it's only so the producers can be like, "Look we have Betty White! We're relevant!" 

She's everywhere just for the sake of being everywhere. And her show Off Their Rockers is kind of bad. I guess I don't hate Betty White. She nice and fine. I just hate the absolute over hype about her.  




 Okay so I saw this anime movie a long time ago and I've never seen it again. I have no idea what it was called or what it was about. In fact I didn't even see all of it. I only watched one part and have been wanting to see it ever since.

The scene I saw involved a man and a little girl. There was also a cyborg like woman attacking them. This was in like the near future I believe. So the cyborg woman attacks the man with some sort of hand blade thing. I think. But the man holds up his hand and the blade goes through his hand and stops right at his eye. It was also raining I believe. And this took place within a skyscraper I believe. Please identify this! It's been haunting me for years! 




 I've played a lot of Skyrim. I've seen almost all it has to offer. It's really starting to bore me. What are some ways or challenges I can do to make it interesting again?

Edit: I'm on 360. 




 I'm 19. One friend who works all the time and when he's not working, he's with his girlfriend. So I never hang out with him. 

Weekends suck because I always spend them alone. 

I mean, I have many "friends" but we never hang out. I only have one real friend. I always invite people to stuff but they rarely accept. 

I'm a nice, funny, caring guy. What's wrong? I just want to enjoy my life because I don't know how long I'll be alive, but its hard to enjoy life alone.

I have some friends who frequent Reddit. A few know my username. So if anyone who knows me sees this, don't let me know that you've seen this.

 Thanks for listening, everyone.  









 What song do you think has the best singing you've ever heard? 




 Saw this movie a while ago. Can't remember title for the life of me.  





























 Didn't know where else to put this. I just want to see it get made. The creator has said that The Jungle Movie, the next and final HA! movie, was suppose to be the last movie. It would've answered all sorts of things like what happened to Arnolds parents, what happens between him and Helga amongst wrapping up  the stories of all the other kids. [Here's an interesting article](http://tendraheyarnold.wordpress.com/2009/03/28/confirmed-notes-about-the-jungle-movie/) where Craig Bartlett, the creator, talks about the unmade movie and what would've been in it. 

It saddens me that this might never be made. I just need closure! 




 So what movies have made you cry just out of the sheer beauty of it? I watched To the Wonder tonight and there was one part where I started crying because of how sweet and beautiful it was and all I said was, "It's so beautiful!" as I was crying. 














 My friend asked me if I knew anyone who could photoshop. I don't so I came to you guys. [Here is the pic](http://i.imgur.com/X6vv7ju.jpg) he wants edited. [Here is what he wants edited onto his glasses](http://i.imgur.com/wVvYJtW.jpg) as if it were reflected onto his glasses. Sort of like [this](http://i.imgur.com/pfxg80W.jpg) for example. Thank you so much for your time! 














 First off I wanna say that I don't hate this movie. In fact, I really liked it a lot. However, it didn't meet my expectations. I think it might have been too over hyped.

Before it came out I saw some reviews that said this movie was incredible and it was the bloodiest movie ever made. Now while it WAS bloody, I felt only one scene was super bloody. I was expecting every death to be crazy amounts of blood everywhere. Also, the trailers were absolutely incredible and did and amazing job of hyping me up. And finally the poster. The poster said "The most terrifying movie you will ever experience." That tagline made me believe I was about to see a remarkable piece of horror.

And the movie wasn't really that scary, it was more just violent. I was expecting to not be able to look at any of the deaths, but it was actually pretty easy to watch. I felt more grossed out watching the original Evil Dead. Now, again, I still really liked and enjoyed this movie, but did the marketing over hype this movie? Or was this all my fault because I set my expectations so high?  




 Going camping in a week. I wanna put together a playlist of some good camp fire music. You know some good accoustic stuff. Stuff that sort of have the feel of someone sitting at a camp fire with a guitar playing. Maybe not just accoustic. Maybe some nice mellow stuff. So what do you guys think should be on this playlist?

What I have on the playlist so far to give you guys an idea

Over the rainbow - Israel Kamakawiwo'e

Guaranteed and Society - Eddie Vedder

 Are there any fictional movies like Samsara in terms of cinematography? It's one of the most breath takingly beautiful movies I've ever seen and I'm curious if there are any other movies that aren't documentaries that have similar cinematography or even similar thematic elements.  




 Who decides what commercial to show and when? How do they decide this? Is it random or on a playlist? How do commercials come on automatically?  












































 So I have a lot of money and I wanted to spice my game up by giving my character an overhaul in terms of his looks. The problem is I don't know what to change and how to make him look. I need inspiration. You think you can post a screenshot of your character? Show your character off! Maybe one of your awesome characters will inspire my new character. I'm just not really creative and my character's super generic. Thanks! 



















 Okay so I watched 500 Days of Summer and it kind of reminded me of Blue Valentine in that it was sort of a story about the rise and fall of a relationship told in a nonlinear fashion. I want to see some more movies like this.

So, are there any good movies about the rise and fall of a relationship? Movies where you see the beginning and end of a relationship? It can be about the relationship between husband and wife, girlfriend and boyfriend, between friends, parent and child, etc., any relationship told in either nonlinear or linear fashion. It just really fascinates me to see how a relationship progresses from two people getting to know one another, to loving each other, then to see it start to crumble and eventually fall. Blue Valentine is one of my favorite movies, but it's also one of the saddest I've ever seen. Thanks! 




 So I want to get Operation Flashpoint but don't know which one to get. So simply, which is better(mechanics, gameplay, graphics, difficulty, fun, etc.)? 




 First off, sorry if this post doesn't belong here. If it doesn't, please let me know where to put it, thanks!

I can't decide which show to watch so I came to ask you guys. Basically, which show should I watch? Which is more worth my time watching? Thanks! Note: I haven't seen any of these shows before.

* Arrested Development

* Lost

* Mad Men

* The Killing

* Archer

* Twin Peaks

* Hell on Wheels

* House of Cards

* Bob's Burgers

* Parks and Recreation

* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia 

* Louie

* Alias 




 I'm new here and just wanted to say hi. 









 Okay so I've only played like three quarters of Mass Effect 1 and stopped because my game was messing up so I never went back. Recently I've been wanting to play a Mass Effect game. The only thing stopping me is the fact that I'm like two and a half games behind and don't have that kind of time to play both Mass Effect 2 and 3 on top of finishing the first one.

I listen to a couple of gaming podcasts so I kind of know what happens in all of the Mass Effect games and kind of know what's going on. So I want to get Mass Effect 3. My question is: Is it a good idea to jump in the third one without finishing the first and not playing the second? Will I know what's going on or get lost? Also, should I get ME3 or ME2? I've heard from almost everyone that ME2 is better, but I'll only have time to play one of them so I figured I'd get ME3 because it's the last one. Basically, which one will give me the better experience(better mechanics, story, fun, stuff to do, etc.)? 









 [How does these kinds optical illusions work](http://media.log-in.ru/i/3dstereo_2.jpg)? How are they made? I don't get it. 




 What's your favorite song that was written specifically for a movie?

Mine's probably Down to Earth from Wall-e. Yours doesn't have to be a Disney song, though. 



















 So I was driving and some nut turned in front of me and scared me to death. My heart skipped a beat. Then I thought, what happens in your body when that happens? What causes it? What's going on? 









 Like, if I saw a man who weighed 125 lbs I would think that he looked gross and unhealthy and like a skeleton. However, when you see a woman who weighs 125 lbs she looks healthy and normal? Why do women look different than men who weigh the same?  




 I've been out of high school for almost two years contemplating what to do in terms of education. I've always known what I wanted to do: Film. So after tons of reading and thinking I've decided that I want to be a professor of film. And in my free time I'd work on my film. So my question is what classes did you take to be a professor of your chosen subject? How long did it take? 




 So this documentary is fantastic. It's basically interviews with big filmmakers about digital vs film. Really interesting! Definitely worth your time. 

[Here's the link for it on Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Side_by_Side/70239473?trkid=2361637) 




 Also, who are some actors/actresses that don't deserve all the work they get and should be getting less roles?

My pick for actor that should get more roles: Jared Leto. He's good in everything he's in, but I don't see him enough. Runner up: Ben Foster

My pick for actor who shouldn't be getting as many roles as they do: Adam Sandler. He's a funny guy with good acting chops, but he hasn't made a quality movie in a long time.  









 First off i want to say that if this isn't a good place to post this please tell me a good place to post it. So I play Skyrim on the Xbox and I've put a ton of time into it and have a high ranking character, but eventually I want to get a pc. I wanna add mods to it. However I don't want to have to start from scratch. So my question is, is there any possible way to move my character profile from my Xbox to my pc? Could I import my save somehow or somehow create a fake save? Anything I can do? 









 I've applied at nearly 100 places within the last 4 months. I've been unemployed for about 8 months. I'm about to go to college and need a job, but haven't been able to get one for 8 months despite the fact I apply to multiple places a week. I mean, I don't even get a call. I never hear from the job, so I have no closure about if they even saw my application or not. 

This upsets me because I've been searching for 8 months, however I have friends and family members that got jobs after looking for only a couple of weeks. And we have the same amount of qualifications. What gives? How come the people who actually need and want a job and have been looking forever seem to stay unemployed? And the people who don't need a job, but want one just so they'll have money to buy material objects they don't need seem to get jobs easy? This blows. 




 First off I want to say that I'm not sure if this post belongs here, and if it doesn't, please let me know where it goes, thanks.

So I got a speeding ticket today. Why does this piss me off? Because I've only sped twice in my life counting today. Both times I've gotten a ticket. And both times unintentional. I know a bunch of friends and family that speed on purpose all the time and never once have they gotten pulled over! Why me? This blows! 

Also, I was ONE mile away from my house! 




 Hey guys. I'm pretty new here and have some experience with guns but I have a question. I just bought a used leather holster. It was made for a S W 659 but it will hold any pistol of the same size because it's not specifically molded for the S W. So what are some other pistols the same size and dimensions as the S W 659? Thanks for the help! 









 What are some movies where a person or group of people travel across a country (any country) and they experience the various natural wonders and beauties of mother nature as well as various cultures. And even meet some strange people along the way? Something in the vein of Into the Wild or Wild America? Not a documentary though. An actual movie. 




 I'm looking for movies that are epic, but not epic as in huge. I mean epic as in the movie spans across a vast amount of years. Something in the vein of Bicentennial Man. Or maybe Forrest Gump? 




 What line or quote from any movie or tv show is your favorite? Feel free to post links to videos or pics of the quote. 




 What exactly are electronic cigarettes and what makes the different and healthier than regular cigarettes? 




 There was a game I played a lot in either the late 90s or early 00s. It was an internet based game on a website. I mostly played it in the computer lab. It had to do with a fox I think? It had multiple levels. Each level was a different puzzle I think? One of the levels had you bouncing a bubble with another bubble. You had to keep the bubble in the air and it couldn't touch the ground. Again, it has to do with a fox. I think it might have had the word "fox" in the title or url. Please help! 




 What scene from a movie was serious or not meant to be funny but had you laughing hard? 




 I saw the Fast and Furious 6 trailer during the super bowl and it got me thinking. I remember the first Fast and Furious way back when it was just a small crime movie about an undercover cop in the street racing world of a California city. Now it's evolved into international heist/race action thriller taking place in world locations with huge action. Not that I'm complaining, I just find it interesting how this franchise started as one thing and has changed into something else entirely different. 

So, what other movie franchises or tv shows have started as one thing and turned into something else entirely? For better or worse? 

**EDIT:** I'm no talking about what franchises stated off good and ended up bad. I'm basically saying what franchises or shows have basically changed genres. Example: The Fast and Furious used to be a small crime movie and is now an over the top international action movie.  




 Hey I'm new here, but I love writing. Was wondering what you thought of my short story. Give me some constructive criticism. [It's called NDE](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0By3l0nVnUv1hU0t4aEFRc3pWTVk/edit) It's a working title. 




 Hey guys I'm new here and also started collecting last summer, so I thought I'd post some pics of my collection so far.

1. Memphis/TN/USA

2. August 4

3. Anything mind-bending

4. Probably Charlie's Angels

5. Mission Impossible 2

6. In the Name of the King

7. Either Christopher Nolan, Terrence Malick, or Zack Snyder

8. The Thin Red Line Criterion Collection

9. Kill Bill The Whole Bloody Affair

10. Alphabetical

11. IMDB?

I'm planning on adding to my collection frequently, but here's what I have so far.

[My collection so far.](http://imgur.com/a/6DTiI)  




 I saw the Impossible and it's one of the best movies not only of the year, but in a while. It has incredible effects, acting, and directing. So why is it basically non existent at all these award shows and top ten lists? How come this fantastic film is getting no nominations at practically any award shows and getting hardly any recognition from critics and columnists? I've seen tons of websites and magazines talk about what they think are the best films, but no one mentions the Impossible. What gives? 




 Out of all the years the Oscars has been around, what do you think is the biggest snub in Oscar history? 




 I saw Zero Dark Thirty on Friday and I was thinking this is such an American movie. But, is it the most American movie? Probably not, but what do you guys think is the most American movie ever made? 

Also, if you had to pick a movie to represent America and what America is, what would it be? Like what movie embodies best what America is? Like, if you gave an American film to a foreign person in order to show them what America is really like and what we're all about, what film would that be? 




 Pretty self explanatory. I would love to see a sequel or prequel to the Iron Giant. So, Reddit, what is your pick? Also, what would it be about? 




 Also, what would they be? They can be anything. Your relative, sibling, friend, your dentist, your teacher, local cop, weather man for your local news station, etc., etc.. They can be anything! Anything! 




 Guys, we've already seen posts about what were the best movies of 2012 and the best cinematography and best performances of 2012. But what do you guys think are the best scores of 2012? Or best soundtracks or best original songs of 2012? I really loved the scores for Samsara and Dredd because they really captured the mood and feeling of those films. But what do you guys think are the best? 




 Hey I'm looking for a show. It was a Japanese game show that came on G4 and I loved it. It was a show that had a ton of extremely difficult obstacle courses. One of them was had people unicycling along super thin platforms and hopping upstairs. That's the only obstacle course I can remember right now. Please help! 




 Hey guys. Recently I've had an urge to play a game with good tactical multiplayer. Something along the lines of Spec Ops from Call of Duty(best example I could think of). I want something they relies heavily on tactics, communication, and teamwork in order to win/complete objectives. It can be co-op, online or offline, doesn't matter. Or even player vs player/team vs team. I don't really care what genre it is either so long as it's good tactical multiplayer/co-op. Thanks, guys!

Edit: Preferably console games. I don't have a decent pc. 














 Hey guys and gals. I was playing spec ops: the line and noticed in the settings that you could change the filter on the game to change the look of it. This reminded me of red dead redemption. In RDR, you could change the brightness and contrast and make it as vibrant and colorful as you want, or as desaturated as you want. You could even make it black and white if you so desired. I thought this was an awesome feature as it allowed you to tailor your game to the look and feel that YOU wanted. So my question is are there any other games for consoles that allow you to change/adjust the color/contrast/look of the game?  




 Hey everyone! Listen, I'm pretty new to photography so I need some help looking for a good wide angle lens. I have a Canon EOS Rebel T3i. My budget is preferably no more than $150 and the most I'll absolutely go is $200. Also, how reliable is ebay for buying lenses? Thanks for all the help! 




 I was wondering if you guys can suggest a movie that will make me cry. I'm a guy and I've seen a lot of movies, but none have made me cry. I hear people all the time talking about a movie they saw that made them cry, and I want to experience that. I want to see a movie that affects me so much on a personal/mental/emotional level that it makes me cry. I don't really know why I want to experience this other than the fact that I haven't ever experienced it. There are a few movies though that have brought me close to tears such as Requiem for a Dream and Lion King. I would say it takes a lot to make me cry. I mean I cried when my golden retriever died and I cried when my grandparents died, but that's basically it. A friends son past away recently and I didn't even cry (I don't mean that in a proud way). I mean sure I was sad, but I didn't cry. So I think it has to affect me on a personal level. So can you guys suggest a movie so incredibly sad and depressing that if it doesn't make me cry then there's something wrong with me? 




 So I'm having family photos done tomorrow at around noon. It's going to be outdoors. I live in Tennessee. What should I wear? I'm going to go shopping today. I'm looking for some jeans and a shirt and possibly a jacket. So, generally speaking, what colors/patterns should I get? What kind of jeans/shirt should I get? If I got a jacket of some sort, what kind should I get? It's a pretty casual shoot. I really want to look nice because these will be the last photos of us for a good while. Thanks guys! 




 So I want to start off by saying I'm sorry if this isn't a good place to post this, but it seems like it belongs here. Also, I'd like to say that yes, Nathan Fillion would be the perfect Nathan Drake, but I think we can agree that it won't happen unfortunately. Now, the person I think should play Nathan Drake is Bradley Cooper. Hear me out. The guy is a pretty solid actor. He can be funny and he can be serious. He also has the physique to be able to handle a role like this. The guy's got star power! This is just my opinion, but what do you guys think? Every time this topic comes up, Brad Cooper's name isn't even mentioned.  









 Okay so you know how at the end when Joe sees Sara get shot and the screen's all gold, and Joe says he saw everything, a mother die for her son, a man kill for his wife yadda yadda yadda. Then he says something about how the loop is closed or something like that. I think it should have ended there implying that he caused Cid to be the man he grows up to be, and the events in the movie will repeat itself forever, therefore creating an endless "loop". I think that's how it should have ended. I think it would have created a bigger impression and been a better ending. But this is all just my opinion. 




 I don't know if this goes here, but here I go. I want to know why so many pc users relentlessly hate on Apple products. I'm not trying to start a flame war or anything. I want to have a serious discussion about this because I am genuinely curious. Like when my friend (who hates Apple and loves pc and Android) comes over and I say my iphone or macbook is acting up, he says it's "because Apple made it." I've asked him what his problem with Apple is before and he has never given me an answer other than "because Apple sucks." In fact, most of my pc friends react this way. So in an attempt to get valid reasons why people who use pc and Android tend to hate Apple, I've come to you guys for answers. Again, I'm not trying to start a flame war. I just want some insight on this issue.  




 I saw a movie either in the late 90s or early 00s where a guy transformed into a woman (I think only at night?). I think when he was a woman he had black hair, but I'm not sure. I remember one scene where he was a woman and some guy (with glasses?) was trying to sleep with him/her. Again I'm not 100% certain on some of these details. 









 I ask this because in order to make one, they will have to reboot Batman again. Plus they will have to reboot Superman again because this new Man of Steel (based on the trailer) will be like Batman and won't allow a way for other DC heroes to exist in its world. In my opinion, I would rather have a great Batman series, Superman series, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, etc. if it meant that there wouldn't be a Justice League movie rather than have crappy movies of these super heroes just so a JL movie can happen. So how badly do you guys want a JL movie? Bad enough to have crappy super hero movies just to have your JL movie? Or would you rather continue having great super hero movies if it meant there would be no JL movie?  









 Hi, I'm new to Reddit and relatively new to photography. I have a Canon EOS Rebel T3i and would like to start taking pictures of things like insects, plants, eyes, and other small things. What kind of lens should I get? What should I look for? Like I said, I'm relatively new to photography so I don't know a lot of the terminology, so could you please answer as if you were talking to an amateur. Also, if you could maybe suggest some lenses, that would be helpful, too. Thanks you guys for any help you can give!
Also, any tips for macro photography would be nice! Not necessary, just nice!
