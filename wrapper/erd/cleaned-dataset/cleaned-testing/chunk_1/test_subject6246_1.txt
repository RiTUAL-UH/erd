 Thank you. I'm supposed to take the Oxazepam everyday for three to four days and then when I feel like I need to.  




 We have two small children (1 and 3 yo). The older one have been sick for some weeks so last weekend they slept at my husbands parents house so that we could catch up on our sleep. Other then that I can't remember us going on a date for some time. This saturday we are invited to a party for my brother-in-law. Maybe we can leave the kids to their grandparents a little early and go out for dinner before the party. 

My husband is home on parental leave with our youngest now. Maybe that sounds strange but in Sweden where we live it's normal. I have been thinking about going away to visit a friend but it feels like I'm trying to run away from my problems if I do that.  




 I hope I will be able to feel like this some day. Right now I have trouble seeing a future at all. How are you supposed to live if you can't handle being alive? I just don't understand how people do it. 

I work out occasionally. We actually have a gym in our home. But I just don't feel like even getting started because I know that I will fail again. Sorry for the pessimistic answer. :/ 




 Thank you. It really helps to hear this from someone who has been through this. I can really relate to apologizing. I just want tell everybody how sorry I am for being such a disappointment.  




 I took my first pill this morning (it's called Citalopram, maybe the name is different in different countries). They told me that the anxiety gets worse in the beginning so I also take pills called Sobril or Oxascand (I think the name in english is Oxazepam maybe). The anxiety was worse before I took them but now I just feel kind of empty. Like I'm not able to feel or think at all. I guess that means it's doing what it's supposed to?
