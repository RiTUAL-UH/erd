 Journalists won't take pictures because they know they will be retaliated against if they do; in this report he said they might delay airing the report for their safety. I would be surprised if he's ever let in Gaza again. 




 So HOW should they do it instead? 




 Wary. They'll turn back to anti-semitism as soon as their preachers have a change of heart. 




 If true, this would give an almost 1:1 militant to civilian ratio, which is in line with previous conflicts in the Gaza strip. The Gaza Health ministry run by Hamas say that there has been 1,900 dead, of which 80% or so are civilians. 









 He meant 96% of West Bank civilians, under areas A and B. 




 Because, legally, as soon as the charge is brought Israel can counter charge the PA with much worse. 




 To add a bit too this, the "character" of God in both Islam and Judaism are almost the same, so much so that it is universally agreed within Judaism that Muslims worship the same God. It's a debate whether Christians are polytheistic or not. 




 It's a midrash that Muhammed took and incorporated into the Qur'an. 




 To add to Lazer_Taxon, the evangelicals in America are the greatest "bloc" support of Israel -- but only because they believe it will hasten the second coming. As soon as their preachers switch back to anti-Semitism, 15% of America will go back to hating Jews again. 




 A quote without a source! Might it be pulled out of your ass? 




 It is no no longer a war crime if it is used as a military site, which is what Hamas is doing to this hospital. So Israel is going to bomb one building, not the whole thing, once all the civilians leave. 




 maddoweis.net

Nice joke, hilarious! 




 Older people saw the international Palestinian terrorism during the cold war, and educatikn teaches you is not as simple as casualty numbers. 




 To get a different perspective about the letter, read this:

I'm going to try to re-translate the letter myself and see if it comes out differently.

 Kidnap. If they're not allowing Red Cross visits or abiding by the Geneva Conventions, it's kidnapping. 




 The attack came less than 2 hours into the "ceasefire." 




 Please change "they" to "Hamas", you don't know how stupid some people are.

Edit: People upvoted my comment, I guess that works just as well. 




 Soldiers are captured if they are allowed visits by the Red Cross and the captors follow the other Geneva Conventions related to POW's. Hamas doesn't, so the soldier is kidnapped.  




 THe army went in the day that Hamas militants first attacked from one of these tunnels. Unless you think Israel controls Hamas... 




 The tunnels going into Israel cannot be used to transfer goods, they are only to attack Israel. 




 http://this-is-not-jewish.tumblr.com/post/34344324495/how-to-criticize-israel-without-being-anti-semitic 




 There are actually a lot of reports that ground troops are really frustrated that, though they are finding lots of tunnels and booby-trapped houses, they can't get the people shooting at them. 




 Wow, great rebuttal. I'm impressed. 




 Not quite yet. It will if Israel decides to go further. 




 For the 10th time, [Haaretz live blog at 7:45pm.](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.607945) I couldn't submit it because as a live blog it was already submitted. 




 Correct me if I'm wrong

You are wrong. All of the tunnels that Israel is destroying now are ones leading into Israel to conduct terrorist attacks. The IDF only put boots on the ground in Gaza after the attack from one such tunnel. 




 ...what? Because this is true. 




 Um, no?

This is the "Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War."

This specific section is "Wounded and sick IV. Discontinuance of protection of **hospitals**" [emphasis added]

If you want to prove your point, find a general article, or at least one that doesn't mention that it's specifically for hospitals

  




  Yet they didnt do it last time they had chance, nor ever before.

When was this time? They've only attacked sporadically from tunnels after it was clear that the IDF is going to destroy them so Hamas won't be able to use them in the future. 

The tunnels were stupidly not taken as a big danger by the government until now. If one attack happened from a tunnel and casualties resulted, Israel would immediately invade Gaza and destroy them. They could only be used once/in one military operation.

They dont need 10 people kidnapped, they can get the equal attention by a single guy or a couple.

No, they need as much people killed and kidnapped as possible, for popularity, money, and exchanges.
 




 Unfortunately, there will be no journalists in the area because it's an active military zone and ground fighting. No confirmation from other completely unbiased sources will have to wait. 




 If Israel is destroying everyone and everything, they're doing a horrible job at it. I'm sure that given 3000 bombs the US could level Gaza within a few hours. 




 And everything else is just a claim by Hamas. Do you actually expect journalists to report every detail about military operations from an active military zone? 




 http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter4_rule14 




 So if I shoot at you many times but either miss or hit your bulletproof vest, you'll just sit there and take it? 




 Good, now you're reading! Not quite enough though. This is only regarding hospitals, **not UN shelters.** Find another article to support your claim. In addition, the only time Israel has deliberately bombed hospitals is with imminent military activity or large stores of weapons and warnings. 




 Purpose? To massacre and kidnap Israeli civilians. This achieves many of their goals at once. 




 No, the censor doesn't provide false info. Does the IDF itself? Very possibly, many militaries do. 




 It was formed specifically for Palestinians because of the creation of tons of Palestinian refugees when the ~~general assembly granted Israel the land~~ war broke out between Israel and the surrounding Arab countries, including Palestinians. There would have been no refugee problem without the war.

And really, the ones in the West Bank and Gaza (especially the latter) should not be called refugees. 

1. No other population has refugee status transferred to children.

2. Those under the control of the PA and hamas are free to move around in their territory, they don't have to stay in refugee camps. But it presents a better image to the world and continues their claim, so they stay. 




 Haaretz specifically mentions it, and I've linked to it a bunch of times here. 




 No, initially it was reporting (and still is) 70-80% civilian casualties,  "among them" women and children. Easy to be misled though, with how it's reported. Currently, [by the washington post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/world/gaza-counter/), about 1/10 are women and 1/5 are children under 18. Women make up 50% of the populace, while children make up around 50-60%

Your source is the top end, the UN is reporting 3:1 or 4:1, and the IDF is saying between 1:1 and 2:1. But for now, these high numbers will be used to bash Israel as much as possible while the reports in 3 months will be brushed under the rug. 




 I'm saying that there is one refugee organization for the Palestinians and one for everyone else. It's not racist, but it is a double standard. 




 Eh, state actors are still expected to minimize casualties if possible. 




 The journalists know the full news, even if they can't publish it. Again, they wouldn't publish something false deliberately. 




 85% is a 1:5.5 ratio, and I'm sure it will go down right after the fighting is over and Hamas announces their martyrs. It doesn't change the fact that lots of civilians are suffering though. 




 Oh, Israel has done a lot wrong. There just happens to be (or was) an Israeli peace movement, but not a Palestinian one. It sucks. 




 "Terrorism" or not, they are still a military target. And rockets are purposefully attacking civilians with the purpose of committing genocide, even if they suck at it. 




 Because logistically, it's impossible to bring stuff in and out more than once without Israel noticing. 




 Reading comprehension alert:

the presence of small arms and ammunition taken from such combatants and not yet handed to the proper service, shall not be considered to be acts harmful to the enemy.

these are neither "small arms and ammunition" nor have they been "taken from combatants."  




 Saving your comment! 




 The first rockets and war with Gaza (2006) was before the blockade took effect. Lifting it now would only cause a free flow of weapons into the strip. 




 They are currently hiding in the network of tunnels built instead of  hospitals and bomb shelters. So brave. 




 He has reported for The Jerusalem Report, the Forward, the Wall Street Journal and WRNI among others

Nice selection bias. Most Israelis serve in the IDF that doesn't mean anything.

 




 Great response :P 




 Ok, provide proof if you think otherwise. 




 So what should Israel do instead? 




 What do you mean, stupid? During a lull in the fighting when Israel is not  expecting it, possibly during a holiday, they break out of 8-10 tunnels near towns. Then they murder and kidnap as many people as possible before escaping. 




 If there is military activity in the area, it becomes a legitimate military target even if it is a declared safe zone. It then comes down to the amount of civilian casualties vs. military benefit like any other target. Doesn't make it a war crime to do so unless the civilian casualties are extremely excessive. 




 The first two were written before the full news came out, as did Haaretz. Haaretz then published an update after the full information was cleared for publishing. 




 Again, this is less than a mile from the boarder with Gaza and is constantly monitored. The only reason that they weren't discovered until now is because they are closed at the top until the militants attack. Why wouldn't they just use the Egypt ones they have? Why use thousands of tons of concrete for these and not the ones into Egypt? 




 The 8:1 ratio. 




 That's because it's an organization with helps refugees -- but only Palestinian ones. 




 Haaretz has it too, is that any better for you? It is still coming from the IDF in the end.

I think Israel has made numerous mistakes for this assault, and I'm still waiting for an explanation of the bombing/shelling of the market and school today. That doesn't mean that Israel is committing genocide or deliberately killing civilians. 




 Just think about the logistics of transferring goods into Israel, to the border which Israel is constantly watching, and then bringing those goods into the tunnels and out the other side. You really think this was ever done? 




 How many months did it take to build this tunnel while it was being used? You think the UN employees didn't know about it? 




 Cite the 8:1 source, which means only 1 out of every 9 people killed is civilian. The most I've seen (out of the Hamas run health agency!) is 4:1, and sometime 3:1. They've claimed similar numbers before, but when the dust has settled down it usually comes to around a 1:1 ratio, and I am expecting the same to happen this time. 




 I would love to be paid for this! I would be making so much money right now. :P 




 [It also has lots of credible journalists.  
](http://www.timesofisrael.com/about/)
 




 where, link? You're claiming two things in this thread and citing no proof. 




 Do you have a link to the last? Hebrew is fine. 




 Not yet. I bet Hamas' plan was to attack from all of them at once, but they didn't get the opportunity before the fighting started. 




 Read Haaretz every day and then say that no one ever criticizes the IDF. 




 The tunnels into Egypt are for smuggling, but it's not like Hamas can transfer goods into tunnels in Israeli territory. Why do you think they're building tunnels into Israel, [most of them near civilian towns](http://i0.wp.com/www.jewishpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IDF-map-of-TerrorTunnels.jpg?fit=485%2C485)? 




 No Israeli newspaper will deliberately print false information. [The US had a censorship office during WWII as well.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Censorship) 




 Haaretz current live blog at 7:45 

http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.607945 




 Well, the post is gone now and it wouldn't allow me to comment *shrug*

Unfortunately, no international news source is publishing info like this as fast or as thoroughly as Israeli news sources are. It would be nice if CNN or other international publications produced the detailed reporting that ToI and haaretz is doing, but they don't have the audience for it.

The IDF might be wrong, but there is no source for this outside the IDF anyway, and any news organization would have to source them. That doesn't answer why you think ToI is run by the IDF. 




 Because the UN workers live in a culture where they are under threat by Hamas and it's much easier to look the other way than than speak out, especially when you came to help Palestinians anyway and your boss is doing the same. 




 This Israeli censor doesn't provide false information, only prohibits some news to be released for a time. 




 Because you can call a building empty, but if Israel tries to bomb it as a legitimate military target than civilians in the two other buildings can be hurt/killed. 




 And what about haaretz?

http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.607945 at 7:45 




 Building underground is easier than building above ground, really? I guess we're just really inefficient then, and we should all live in hobbit holes!

Plus, there is still quite a lot of empty land is gaza to build on, just look at google maps. 




 It comes from an IDF general stating what 800,000 tons of concrete could build; that is just math. Why do you think that ToI is any more "run by high ranking IDF members" than any other Israeli news site.

Edit: ~~Since you deleted your comment downthread~~ since your comment was deleted...

OP here, not a shill. I am Israeli, and started posting when I began to be disturbed by all the shit that gets posted here. I'm actually a leftist and would gladly vote for Meretz if I trusted Palestinian people/leadership, but like 95%+ of Israeli Jews I support this operation. I will need to look at what is said about the shelling of the school and market today, as well as some other things that happened;  like the "IDF bombing" of the school a few days ago which turned out to be an Islamic Jihad misfired rocket. I can't say anything about that now though, or I would contribute to the "Israel is a genocidal baby murderer" meme here. People can't seem to understand that it is neither in Israel's strategic interest, not do they want to, kill civilians. 
























 I hears reports of at least 13 Hamas members captured or surrendering. Is this possibly one of the goals of the ground invasion, maybe for intelligence purposes, or just a fluke? I don't remember any reports of captures members in 2006 or 2008. 







































 I've been fasting since early this morning; no food and no water. Since starvation mode is activated when you eat too little, I'm wondering exactly when it starts? I would really like some free energy right now. Anyone have tips to make it begin? I'm starting to feel weak...

Edit: oy, Poe's law. In case people didn't get it, this is satire. I am really fasting though. Thankfully it ends soon after sundown. 




 A UN agency recently announced that around 75% the Palestinian casualties in Gaza. Is this correct, or is it just the UN again? If it is true, why is it higher than the 1:1 ratio in the previous two Gaza operations? 









 Jesus very obviously did not fulfill the important messianic prophecies which people associate with the Messianic age. [\(A small list.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/wiki/jesus) The usual counterargument is that Jesus will return and and fulfill all of them in the second coming. But if I don't believe in Jesus in the first place, why should I assume this? The Messiah will be the person who brings in the Messianic age -- if he dies before doing so, then he cannot be the Messiah ([see Bak Kokhva an example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt)).

So can you prove from the Tanach (Old Testament) that the Messiah will either die before fulfilling the prophecies or come back to Earth after dying? I reject the validity of the New Testament, so unless you want to try to prove that first, it won't be very productive to argue from there.

 




 I know this thread has probably been posted many times in the past, but I have two specific questions I don't have answers to.

1. Why do Muslims think that the text of the Tanach (the Torah, Prophets, and Writings) was corrupted? I know that there is a su'rah (is that the right term?) claiming such, it would be nice if someone could quote it. But I would also like to know how parts are determined to be corrupted and how it happened. Is it just assumed to be the stuff that contradicts the Qu'ran? [I had a small discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/29de5y/islamic_view_on_jews/cik3of9) with /u/possiblea2m about it, but he couldn't follow up on the final answer he gave me, so I clarification on that would be nice as well.

2. Do all Muslims believe that the current Jews are not related to B'nai Yisrael? I was told a such by /u/Redhawk1000 [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/29de5y/islamic_view_on_jews/cijzcnq), but he didn't finish answering my questions. If yes, why? When did the split/loss occur? If no, why is are the quotes wrong? (I have very limited background in Arabic, so please provide translation if you can. Interlinear/transliteration is even better.)

Oh and one minor question I recently thought of. Do the Qu'ran record any prophets in the line of Ishmael (edit: besides Muhammed)? I haven't seen any referenced, but that doesn't mean there aren't.

Thanks in advance for answering! Feel free to ask me any questions about Judaism as well. 

   /May you find peace. 




 My computer is a Dell Inspiron 1440, running windows 7. My computer was slowing down after longer periods of use (over an hour), especially while playing games. I asked here on the live chat what I could do to improve performance and was given various good suggestions. Now, I consider myself somewhat knowledgeable about software if not hardware (I know, I know, I lot of people say this, but I have a little experience programming), so my computer was already clean of malware and I had been disabling unneeded programs running in the background. After trying some of the minor suggestions, I decided to clean the fan when I downloaded Coretemp and realized my computer could run up to 190 degrees F even when only using internet and video chat when in a 70 degree room. After seeing this, I decided to clean the out the fan and make sure nothing was wrong with parts of the computer.

I watched a video on how to disassemble the parts, and it was a great learning experience! Unfortunately, in order to access the fan, I had to take out the motherboard as well instead of just the keyboard and outer case. The fan was indeed dusty, though not quite as bad as other pictures I looked at online. I cleaned the fan using a small vacuum and cloth, cleaned the motherboard of dust with compressed air, and wiped down the non-electrical parts of the computer. I made sure I was very careful, remembered where all the parts and wires connected, and kept track of all the screws and various other parts while taking the laptop apart and putting it back together. The only part I know I might have made a mistake on is the order of the two large chips in the bottom of the computer (Maybe the RAM? I don't know what they're called...taken out at 1:05 on this video:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulecDVBnDwc. Would switching them actually change anything?)

Now my computer turns on, but the screen stays off and after about a minute it starts beeping 4 times in a row every 5 seconds. What could I have done wrong, and what are my options now? I did a full backup right before disassembling, so worst come to worst I guess I'll have bring it to a repair shop and they could fix it and wipe it. Any advice for me, r/techsupport?  




 A common argument I've seen for the validity of Jesus as the Messiah is that he was unique in certain respects. Usually, the twin claims are that he committed no sin and that he performed many miracles, including raising himself from the dead. Putting aside the former claim, (because of the unverifiable nature and that there is no reason for a Messiah to be sinless), why do the miracles make Jesus unique. The Bible clearly states in Deuteronomy 18 to be vigilant against false prophets who will turn people away from the proper worship of God. These prophets will "perform signs and wonders" to prove themselves, and God tells the people not to trust just because they perform miracles.

So why are Jesus' wonders used so often as proof of his status as the Messiah/divine? And are there any other reasons to believe that Jesus was a unique human?

We can also discuss the sinless claim if someone brings a verse to show the Messiah must fulfill that requirement. Please don't bring into the argument that he was God as well, because not only is that impossible to argue about, it doesn't answer my question. 














 Can anyone explain to me what exactly is the reason that minhag is taken so seriously in the orthodox world? I've heard people talk about minhag like they do about kashrut. Some really weird practices are justified as minhag, sometimes so much so that people refuse to change them. Why is it taken so seriously both culturally and halachically? 

I went to Orthodox day school, so feel free to give me sources. 









 Is there any knowledge of specifically how parasites control the behavior of their hosts? What parts of the brain do they affect? Do they block or add neurotransmitters? Does the method change among species? For example, I know some wasps use venom, but fungi or bacteria probably use different means. Links or books to read further on this topic are also greatly appreciated. Thanks! 




 I recently bought Awakening, and absolutely loved it. I owned Path of Radiance and played it when I was younger multiple times. Then I bought Radiant Dawn some years ago and played once, and now I'm playing it again when I rediscovered FE with Awakening. Once I'm done with RD, what game(s) in the series should I play next, and how can I get it? I have a 3DS, a DS, and a Wii, and a computer (:P). Thanks! 




 I was a really big Pokemon fan when I was younger. I played the first and second generations to death, starting multiple games over again so I could experience the thrill of training my pokemon from scratch and beating all the gyms for the first time. I then tried my hand at emerald for a it after it came out, but for some reason I couldn't really enjoy it and stopped after a while. I did the same for Pokemon black, and even almost made it up to the Elite Four, but I didn't understand a lot of the new pokemon, moves, or any of the background stuff. 

I just got a 3DS and a copy of Pokemon X for my birthday, and I want to play and understand, and enjoy it! I'm really excited about the new generation since it seems really immersive. I'm not really interested in the competitive scene nor spending hundreds of hours breeding the best pokemon, but I do want to know how to better train the ones I catch! 

So what's new? What are EV's, how do battles with multiple pokemon flow, did B-down to catch a pokemon ever actually work (I'm still going to use it anyways!), etc. Educate me, please!
