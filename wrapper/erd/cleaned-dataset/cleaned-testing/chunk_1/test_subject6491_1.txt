I don't like free move at all, so I guess that rules out most RPGs. But any nice board games, civ style, space, etc. are welcome. 

Thanks 




 Who wouldn't want to watch episodes named Antipasti, Minestrone, Pane, Pizza (highest rated episode ever), Spaghetti and for season finale, Tiramisu.
 













































































































 This accusation coming from Wendy got me thinking, what if Kendal isn't innocent and was telling (partially) the truth? This is by far the most diskish move by Raylan and he's willing to put a manipulated boy (guilty or not) 40 years in prison just to get his chance at his big brother. And if he didn't do it? "Well, that makes it worse". 



















 Let's say I use Arc with 40% chance of shock (10% from gem + 10% from quality + 20% from passive nodes). If I link Chain to it, I hit more enemies, and have better chance to trigger shock. However, Chain also reduces the damage considerably. If I understand this correctly, shock has a minimum duration that is derived from damage. So less damage means less duration, and if the duration is below the required minimum, shock won't trigger. 

Can anybody shed a light on this subject?

 I'm currently using Moon+ Reader Pro for reading, and I'm happy with it, but I never found the speed reading to be very useful. 

I've just read this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1yvvam/software_that_speeds_up_your_reading_to_500_words/) and I thought maybe I'll give other apps another shot.

My requirements are: ability to open any epub/mobi book on the device, speed settings, and one-sentence-at-a-time UI.

Thanks!

 On the face of it, House of Cards is another political drama, telling the story of one congressman on his way to gain power. I usually hate this kind of television, telling us how great government is and how people with opposite views learn to come and work together. However, this show arguably provides the best criticism today on government and politics in their current form.

Nobody on the show cares about the public, and everybody's working out of self-preservation, narrow political interests, ego and selfishness. 

Bills, projects, acts, executive orders and such, are all introduced, executed, canceled, supported or opposed based on the political points, and almost never on 'what is right for the people'. It shows how people with political power can crash regular people and businesses standing in their way.

The writing is almost always cynic. Phrases like 'I have no ulterior motive here' are always there to hide something else. 

There's also some nice criticism on representative democracy. Season 1/2 **spoiler**: When the congressman sworn to VP (replacing the existing one), he looks at the camera and say: 'One heartbeat away from the presidency, and not a single vote cast in my name. Democracy is so overrated.'

Another nice touch is that the anti-hero is a democrat. So most of the people who abuses power and deceives are from the left.

Anyway, besides the criminal aspect of the story (which I think can be regarded as fiction and not a true demonstration of politicians) the entire system is pained in very unflattering colors.

 Here's something the bugs my mind. Let's say your country descend (ascend?) into anarchy. Who should take over the parks, roads, rivers, sea and other public areas?

Private hands, sure, but the way I see it, everyone has a right to this stolen land, and everyone can claim ownership of it. So who'll get it? 










































































 If you are waiting for a particular deal on an item or just want to see the daily deal in your rss reader without checking the website everyday, here are instructions on how to it.

First, create RSS feed from the daily deal page. To do that, go to a site called [feed43](http://feed43.com/). It's free and no need to sign up. Click [Create your own feed](http://feed43.com/feed.html?action=new).

Step 1. 

Put in the page address: https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/daily-deals and click reload.

Step 2. 

Leave the first box empty (Global Search Pattern).

Put the following [text](http://pastebin.com/S3z7v82C) in the second box (Item Search Pattern):

    img class="itemImage" src="{%}"{*}/{*}h1 class="name"{%}/h1{*}div class="description"{%}/div{*}div class="label"{%}/div{*}div class="value"{%}/div{*}div class="totalCost"{%}/div

Click Extract.

Step 3.

Fill the properties:

* Feed Title: Path of Exile - Daily Deal RSS
* Feed Link: https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/daily-deals
* Feed Description: Path of Exile - Daily Deal RSS
* Item Title Template: {%2}
* Item Link Template: https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/daily-deals

Item content Template:

    
    {%2} - {%3}/br/br{%4}{%5}. strongDaily Deal: {%6}/strong/br/brimg src="{%1}"/

This is an [image](http://i.imgur.com/kMzdLJ4.png) of how step 3 looks like.


Click Preview and you are done. You can now take the feed URL and use it in your favorite RSS reader.

*Just a quick note: the reason I'm not sharing my feed (and neither should you) is because feed43 limits the pull requests to few hundreds a day. More than 500/hour will get the IP banned.*

*Also, this feed will break if/when GGG changes their html layout. I hope it won't happen often.*


Now that you have the feed and you want to create an email alert, you can use a service called [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/new). There are some straight forward steps to create what they call a recipe. Simply choose **Feed** as a trigger - New Feed Item Matches - Keyword: put the item you are waiting for, like "Black Cat Pet", Feed: put the URL from feed43. - Create Trigger - Email - your email information.

That's it. Hope you found it helpful. 





























 I see that many are asking about ways to evaluate items and decide which to keep and which to vendor. So I'm sharing my personal Excel spreadsheet. It's fast and gives a good snapshot about any Rare item.

First, here's a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/l3grWX6.png). And here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/3aXcp) with more examples (but I'm going to use the first screenshot in my explanation below)

To use the excel, simply copy the item data in the game (Hover item, click Ctrl+C), then go to the spreadsheet and click the button. No need to paste, that's what the button does.
___
**Here's what you get** 
___

~~ The left table is straight forward and contains all the information about the item.

~~ The top-right table displays all the mods. 

* The rank column shows how the **minimum** range of the roll is ranked within the possible rolls. In the example above, *74% increased Energy Shield* is rank #3, because according to [poemods](http://www.poemods.com/index.php?item_type=helmet)   [PoE mods compendium](http://poetools.com/mods-compendium/), the possible rolls for % increase ES in helmet are:

iLvl|range|description
--|--|--
72 | 101 to 120 |(Unconquerable)
60 | 83 to 100 |(Dauntless)
44 | 65 to 82 |(Fearless)
30 | 47 to 64 |(Resolute)
18 | 29 to 46 |(Strong-Willed)
3 | 11 to 28 |(Protective)

So this roll is ranked #3 on the list. Obviously you want to see ranks 1 or 2.

* You can also notice that 2 mods are shaded. those are the 'sought-after' mods. It's not easy to compile a full list, so I did it just the basics:

If the mod contains: | with value above:
--|--
any Resistance	|20
all Elemental Resistance|	10
maximum Life|	60
maximum Mana|	40
increased Energy Shield|	60
increased Armour|	60
increased Evasion Rating|	60
Movement Speed|	20
increased Rarity|	15
increased Quantity|	15
+ to Gems level|	1
+ to Dex/Str/Int|	30
increased Spell Damage|	20

*If you have some knowledge in Excel, you'll be able to update this list, extend it and modify it to your needs*

~~ The middle right table displays the basic properties of the items.

* Here you'll see two ranks. The first is the rank of the item in the entire category, based on [the official list by GGG](http://www.pathofexile.com/item-data). So in the example above, this helmet is #21 on the list (where #1, [Lion Pelt](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Lion_Pelt), is the best white helmet in the game).

* The second rank is how the item is within its armour specific category. Since the helmet in the example is ES, you want to know how it is ranked within the pure ES category (where [Hubris Circlet](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Hubris_Circlet) is considered the #1 helmet). In this example, the helmet is just the 4th best so don't bother with it.

**You want to see items ranked #1 or #2**

*Note: the second rank is only valid to armour. Weapons have just a single category (ranks within wand, staff, 2H axe, etc.)*

~~ Finally, the bottom right table displays the Armour/Attack values and the implicit mods (Armour, Evasion, ES, Phy Damage, Ele Damage, etc)

* For Armour, the following rolls will get marked:

Armour Stats	| Level 1 | Level 2	
--|--|--
Evasion Rating	|800	|1000
Armour	|800	|1000
Energy Shield	|160	|200

**You want to look at those marked level 2**

____

**So what items should you keep?**
____

You want to keep items that have:

1. 2-3 desirable mods
2. Rolls are ranked #1
3. Item is ranked 1-2 within its category
4. The basic stats of the items are level 2 (end game)

About pricing (Domination): Don't get your hopes up. Items usually go for 1 chaos top (rarely 2-3, unless you got some exceptional luck with 4-5 desirable mods, no stupid mods, and high level). Especially if you found them in maps level 72 or less. My recommendation: if an item is in your stash for more than a week, lower the price to 1 alch, if it doesn't go, vendor it and move on. **Good items disappear almost instantly**, so if it's not selling, don't wait.

____

**Batch Mode (!)**
____

If you got this far you probably be happy to know that the spreadsheet supports batch evaluation. Here's how you do it. 

1. Install [this AHK script](http://pastebin.com/W76rk74T).

2. Copy the first item as usual (Ctrl+C)

3. Now go over the rest of the items and click Ctrl+Shift+C. If the item is rare, the data will be added to the clipboard (and not replace it)

4. After you copied up to 10 items, go to the spreadsheet and click the button

5. Now you can use the [up/down arrows](http://i.imgur.com/RZiQ8L0.png) to circle quickly through the items

____

**Download**
____

You can get it from my [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kd9sbxj9zt8xanv/Path%20of%20Exile%20-%20Item%20Eval%20v1.0.xlsm).

Final notes:

* Please don't expect something perfect. It's meant for personal use. 
* Some less common mods are not mapped. 
* Some mods are overlapping (1H/2H/etc). So you might see double readings. 
* I mostly concentrated on Armour and not Weapons. 
* You gonna need Excel 2010, macro enabled (click enable content when prompted). 
* If it's not working for you, or if you have questions on how to expend it and add different values, feel free to pm me.
