 Japes? lolwhat? 




 Even though he is seated a good distance from the marrying families, Bern Cinder met Lorella Royce's eyes through the thick crowd and thought he glimpsed a smile. 




 I would like sigil #7 please! Oh, and this is my first roleplay ever :P 




 wooooooooooooooooops. Correcting. 




 **House Cinder has been considered outlaws in the Vale for hundreds of years. Decendants of** the first men and named after the volcanic caves that has been the center of a fortified hill by the Cinders since the time of the dragons. Some say the volcanic rockfomations (which has give the house it's name) surrounding the cave were created by a stray dragon.

House Cinder were awarded **Strongsong** recently for their **unexpected loyalty** to the Lords of the Vale in the War of the Ninepenny Kings. Lord Cinder managed to still the warrior's want for the spoils of war when the still outlawed mountain clans rode to war with Lord Ormund Baratheon. Lord Cinder knew war was coming to The Vale. It was just a matter of time. 

**The current Lord Cinder**, **"Burk"** recieved the hand of Marinera Corbray. The youngest daughter of Ser Arman Corbray who is 8th in the line of succession to Hearts Home. Together they have recieved two sons aged 13 and a daughter of 7,

House Cinder's **military forces** consists of 2000 fierce and utterly fearless warriors wielding two-handed weapons. 100 mounted noblemen and 900 archers/crossbowmen

Staying true to the vows made to the Lords of the Vale would grant rewards to the those who were patient. 




 With the last hobbit movie out I'm putting a request out there.
A loyal Tolkien-fan with love for the LotR movies and sharp film editing-skills should cut The Hobbit trilogy into a single movie with a max length of three hours.
Are there any aspiring editors out there?

 Tinfoil? Check
It has begun. The **government** has begun. Starting with kids. They will make them feel it is alright that someone is watching you, making sure you behave. 




 Going on an assignment for Tommen. Goes on a killingspree.  




 I'd say wait if you are an honest man. It has released in some countries (here in Sweden), and english is soon to come. They are good though. Really good. I can really praise the comic too. Really well done. 




 Now that. Is what I call a final stop for this particular train. Spring 2016, here we come. 




 I'm surprised no one have asked grrm on his blog.  




 If this is a cheap trick to score sales for The World of Ice and Fire.... Nerdrage is going to happen. We do not have the patience for this kind of shenanigans. The book is nowhere to be seen and millions of people are waiting eagerly.

But my hype is active so long as George doesn't make a firm statement on the notablog. 




 12th day will be The World of Ice and Fire promotion. I am so sure of it. So sure. (fingers crossed) 




 I think the Bronze sword points a little to some kind of forgotten blood sacrifice done by the first men. 









 It means Winds of Winter confirmed!
What would you expect the odds to be for a sneak release 3 days before christmas? Huh!? Huh?! 




 Maybe **We do not sow"** should be "We **could** not sow" 




 Of course I have talked about it with his parents. I thought it would be an interesting topic to talk about though. And so it has proved to be!

 




 I was thinking **Princeless** would be too. If anyone here has a daughter they want to introduce to comics, that would certainly be something to look at.
The theme fits well with today's gender equality-discussions. 




  Am I missing something here or do you not know about the HBO show?

Wait, what? No of course, but I don't think that the universe is at all near to be fully capitalized. Just you wait Wheemix. Just you wait. 




 Beautifully put, and I must say I agree. When this saga is finished (touch wood) I believe it will expand and be regarded as probably the greatest fantasy series ever written. 

**And the movie-franchise will be crazy.** I expect there to be a bidding war over this series, and it will be big. We might even se a red wedding. 




 Is it just me or is it justifiable to pirate the books to get digital copies when you already bought the books? I would say is.
Pirates must not discuss it here, but we can upvote.  




 You make really good arguments..
Is it known if there is a really easy way to gain access to all the avalible comics of Dunk   Egg? 
A Physical copy is a better gift, but they do have two ipads, so a digital copy could make due..
 




 Yes, **I have realized I at least have to re-read them and see in what context and with which words the adultery is described.** 




 I myself discarded that as trying to make some extra bucks because they only just mentioned it when they released the new edition.

It was obviously not supposed to be a part of the story when it was written in the 1980's. Ten years before GRRM even knew that Jon Snow know nothing. 




 With risk of playing the proud uncle. He's really smart and clearly interested in fantasy. He has read and listened to both Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and the Harry Potter-series. Narnia too if I am not mistaken.

Thank god his father is a true nerd. 




 This is so helpful!
It's the mixture of those three that makes me doubt if it's a good idea.
I', fairly certain he will love the story nevertheless. 




 Thank you so much for your helpful post! The Graphics Novels would be perfect (great adaption btw) aside from the fact that his English is not that good. 
**Perfect moment to brag about Swedish english!**

He can understand spoken english fairly well, but written it's a different matter.
The book contains all three novellas though, so I might have to re-read them. Which is not a hard task really. 




 It sure is a tale that resembles Westeros a great deal what I have heard.
And Old Nan's hints about Ice Dragons makes it so much more difficult to decide.

But, since it was written ten years prior to **The Song** I take it as a standalone universe, even though they obviously have common themes. 




 Yeah it was the violence I felt unsure about. There are some nasty duels. I think I might have to read it again to make sure about the most gruesome parts.

The Ice Dragon is not Westeros though. Right? And I think it is for younger audiences even thoough he is not to old for it. (doubt even I am to old for it) ^^ 




 **A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, the perfect steppingstone to introduce young readers to the universe?**

I just visited my local bookstore and after I had drooled over "The World of Ice and Fire" for a minute I noticed this book:

http://s.cdon.com/media-dynamic/images/product/book/book/image0/riddaren_av_de_sju_konungarikena-martin_george_r_r-27265257-2403511085-frntl.jpg

This is the Swedish version of "A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms". And I now recall GRRM stating that the book might get an early release for some countries.

**I got an idea that it could be a great gift for my nephew.**
But before even asking my sister if it's ok I wanted to ask here if you think the novellas are ok for a 10 year old child to read.
He probably have more hours on **Skyrim** than I have, which certainly contains a great deal of violent.

It was a long time ago since I read the Dunk and Egg stories, so I just wonder if anyone here knows if there it contains scenes that might not be ok for a child to read? 
**I thought it might be ok, since there are no sex-scenes in these stories what I can recall. Yet. And the story has a protagonist about the same age as my nephew.**

Would love for someone with a good memory to help me out. 

**This could be the perfect gateway-drug for kids today to grow up with George R R Martin's universe, and if they are lucky A Dream of Spring might release just in time for their graduation**  




 Arya in the Mercy chapter was a highlight for me. I have longed for a more grown up Arya who uses her sexuality to lure her prey. 




 Boy, would that be just after world peace on my list! 




 I noticed a funny post on twitter by GRRM, and not wanting to be too creepy , I thought some speculations are welcome this cold november. Shall we throw in some wild guesses for when this gigant will arrive?

I also noticed his freshly **(?)** updated tour dates on his website which shows a lot of booked events almost once a month. I thought he said he was sitting down not making tours to make more time for writing?

**I think tWoW will release winter 2016** (secretly hoping for summer 2015)

feel free to rate this to the bottom of the internet if this is to much 









 Episode 7: **"Edd, fetch me a block"**

That is all I need.
 




 **I suggest rereading.** If you are a show watcher mainly and havn't heard of the theories around R+L=J you should definitely read the first book again. 
You will have missed too much cut material around what happend in Robert's Rebellion.

Audiobooks are great as well. Roy Dotrice is a king.  




 I'd like The Hedge Knight and the rest of the novellas about Dunk to be a miniseries like HBO.

Robert's Rebellion would be so exciting as a feature film.
Barely any recasting. **Charles Dance** returns for coninving Tywin? 




 Yes he is. And this is my theory.

Bran will be able to weirwood.Net-warg Duncan the Tall because he is Hodor's great grandfather. And therefore fulfilling his life's wish of becoming a knight in some sense. (And what a knight).
This is an idea of my own that came to me when I read a passage in "The Sworn Sword" that read something like this: "It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior. Was there a god of fools?".
It could explain why Dunk acts recklessly without thinking. And also fits in to some great lesson given to Bran by Bloodraven. Bran gets to meet Brynden Rivers in his physical prime and learn about the history of Westeros culminating with the mystery of Summerhall. 




 Arya Stark or just Arya would be pretty mind blowing. She hasn't been referred to as that in the chaptertitles since I don't know when.

It would be time to go home when her name pops up. 




 Dunk and Egg. Try the graphic novel version. It's refreshing. 




 Naah. There were like 24 Brandons with some Bolton rebellions along the way. Rest assured I think the current Bran of Winterfell will learn a lot about his family's history in **the next books.....** 




 The Walk of Shame. 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6%C3%B0r

One theory is that Hr. Brother to Baldr.
Baldr is immortal except for his weakness to mistletoe.

Baldr was tricked by Loki to kill Baldr with an mistletoe arrow.

This could mean Bran safe in the cave where magic protects him from the magic of the Others represents Baldr and Hr is Hodor tricked by another part to kill Bran.

 




 I heard something Kristian said a while back, and that it was him taking a break from the show this year. Have that been changed to Bran not being in it at all?

That sucks then! Heard something about **flashbacks** a week ago. 




 Leto would be the best. Honestly. He's my mancrush. 




 So, we basically have confirmation that Dany will get het whole A Dance with Dragons storyline. (maybe a chapter or so less)

But where will the other characters end up?
**I thought I would fill up this OP with the best theories.**


* **Tyrion** - Ends up practically where book 5 ends. fAegon and JonCon is cut, meeting Ser Jorag and possibly meeting Dany.
* **Bran** -  Confirmed to be stalled one season to catch up with the book with character progress possibly happening behind the scenes.
* **Arya** She should begin her training this season if she is gonna go back to Westeros at the end of season 6. Maybe reaching the Mercy-chapter by the end of this season.
* **Sansa** Filler material. Hopefully gathering the support of the knights of the Vale.
* **Cersei (Whole Kings Landing plotline)** - Maybe as far as the Trial by Combat. Possibly a Maggy the Frog flashback.
* **Jaime** (We know he's going to Dorne, so this covers that plot. Hope for some Bronn development)
* **Brienne** (  Pod) IF they have not cut out Lady Stoneheart completely, she will surface in the last episodes of season 5, threatening to hang Brienne and Pod. if LSH is cut. Your guess is as good as mine what Brienne will do.
* **Jon (The whole North plotline)** - Is elected LC, stabbed and possibly ressurected by end of this season. **GOD. I can't wait for unsullied to get this cliffhanger episode**
* **Sam** If they go with him leaving he probably will be meeting Arya in Braavos before season 5 is over at least, then onwards south.
* **Iron Islands** - Chances are this story will be cut save for Ashas involvement in the North.

Any strong feelings on how they will end next season? I managed to predict season 4 mostly, with some things they cut out and such.
 




 Hopefully another 50 years. 




 The Girl in the Fireplace is a good choice. Especially if he's in to history. 




 Trevligt :) Yeah I feel they catched most themes very well and I'm glad they didn't change any of the names. 
Will probably watch every episode once they're all out. 




 Well yes of course, but they have sure taken some inspiration from the movie as well. That is clear and something I am happy about. Watched that film once a day as a kid! :) 




 **Sanzoku no Musume Ronja**, the japanese Anime, co-produced by Studio Ghibli have aired a few episodes.
Based on the swedish movie **"Ronja Rvardotter"** And the book by the same name written by **Astrid Lindgren** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_Lindgren

I really like it so far. It is fairly true to it's swedish inspiration, something that surprised me. My favourite scene is in the second episode. But I like the original swedish version of that scene far better.
link to the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdAkrQFO-xQ

Have you watched the Anime yet? It is avalible with english sub to stream on some shady streaming-sites and it should not be too hard to find. 









 Please, a link. I am to lazy to find it myself. 




 It's pretty cheap on Ebay! 




 I challenge everyone to team up with a buddy and beat 07:07 minutes boss attack mode!

If you beat my thirteen-yearold selves best time I give you a cookie!

 




 My favourite game Spawn seems not to be supporting VGA if the indicator is the icon at the back of the case.. :(
Might invest in an adapter and scaler if I get money for it. Seems kind of expensive. 




 How much difference does the VGA adapter make quality-wise? Considering I have a 92" projectorscreen I could use some better quality. 




 **Anyone else remember this awesome game?** Well, it's not that awesome now when I come back to it. But as a ten year old, this was the coolest thing I played. Nostalgia is a powerful feeling and this will always be one of my favourite games.

I just played a game of Spawn with my sister, and when playing boss mode I came across the best multiplayer time with my cousin.


We beat the game in 7 minutes (!)
Me and my sis managed in about 25 minutes. Does me an my cousin have some kind of **world record** or something? It's crazy fast.

Pic or it didn't happend: http://i.imgur.com/SGWhyy7.jpg


**Anyone else want to share their record time on multiplayer bossmode?**
 




 Probably Elio Garcia who posted it and it will probably have to do with the eminent release of TWOIAF.

 I don't think **GRRM** uses twitter.
He made Elio set up the account because there were so many fakes with his name. 




 Did everyone notice when he almost spoiled something?

When talking about Aegon the Conqueror and the dragons subjecting the people of Westeros, and with the dragons gone, ultimately they didn't feel the Targaryens had any power over them anymore.

"Of course Dany...." and then he turned in his seat and changed subject. 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6%C3%B0r

Balder is Bran.
Enough said. Whole book spoiled. 




 It was late, I quit when I got into a circularized orbit.

I really **hope** the launch system can lift off from Eve. I will probably have to land on the highest mountain for sure though..

I am bringing (except for the gigant launch system I am pulling) a Science Lab, A lander for Gilly, and a small lander for Eve (with two impact probes).

This ship makes me realize I really need to upgrade my computer. 
I can basically hear my processor **screaming**. 




 (Spoilers All) 
This is my most tinfoil-branded theory. But hey! **That's what we do.**

**Bran** will be able to weirwood.Net-warg **Duncan the Tall** because he is Hodor's great grandfather. And therefore fulfilling his life's wish of becoming a knight in some sense. (And what a knight).
This is an idea of my own that came to me when I read a passage in **"The Sworn Sword"** that read something like this: **"It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior. Was there a god of fools?".**

It could explain why Dunk acts recklessly, childish and without thinking soemtimes. And it also fits in to some great lesson that will be given to Bran by **Bloodraven.** Bran gets to meet Brynden Rivers in his physical prime and learn about the history of Westeros culminating with the mystery of **Summerhall.**

I know its pretty crazy. But I have wondered why GRRM began writing about **Dunk and Egg** in the first place. They are obviously important to the story. And since he began around the release of **A Clash of Kings** he probably already had Bran's fate decided since long ago.

 The most interesting shit about that chapter is her killing Raff the Sweetling on her own initative, and at the end the text refers to her as "ARYA". 
As opposed to her being refered to as "Mercy" for the entire chapter prior to that. I interpret is an a transition where she is beginning to go back to her original identity. 




 Incestanity and Cersei's fucked up raising of him.

 10 000 ships I seem to recall right? Just had to (a) 




 I only know I like season 4 the most. It's like an origin story when they open up the new firm! 




 That's really cool!  




 I'm certainly no pro. But don't you need some regular rockets for when you have escaped the atmo? :)

I am nowhere near trying to take off Eve myself. Just got back from Duna in one piece! 




 It looks amazing! The perfect circles of moons and planets would be a little stretched though. Probably something you can oversee :) 




 The Arryns are Andals? No? But maybe you mean the mountain clans? Totallty first men-descendants. 




 You can totallty fly up there with a dragon, though :) It would be cool to have a Harrenhal 2.0. With Littlefinger roasting juicy mutton chop. 




 His own squire named Payne? (pain)? Assigned to him before the siege he is afraid to die in.

I think it would be that, but I'm not sure. 




 Also, **I know how to do it myself**. But after hundreds of takeoffs and rendevouzs I am sick of it. The fun part is constructing large interplanetary vehicles and stuff. 




 Considering this post is at the top of Reddit, and it is such a valid request, I would see it as a terrible sign if CA doesn't take the advice and release a demo of some sort. 

**They won't get a preorder from me if they don't release a preview! And I know friends who feel the same.**

They aren't very careful with their reputation. 




 I had to go on 9gag and 4Chan.
And now I'm probably gonna cry myself to sleep. 




 Exactly. Probably the best movie ever to show someone unfamiliar with anime.

And one more thing. Studio Ghibli's movies always has this realistic feeling. People act like normal people would, living ordinary lives. Nothing has this unrealistic flawlessness that comes to mind when you think of Disney's films. (oh I do have some Disney favourites, fear you not)

Roger Ebert nailed it. 




 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095327/?ref_=nv_sr_1

Halfway in I was completely sure it had to be based on a true story. It had so much emotions and experiences that would be completely alien to someone who hadn't lived through these events.
I love books and films based on true stories,  and decided to look it up when the the movie would end.

**And then the ending came.**
I think I cried halfway through the credits, and then I looked up the book and the true story. (semi autobiography)
It is written as a tribute and an apology.

And apparently the ending is shown exactly like it happend IRL.

The most powerful movie I have seen this year. 
**If you havn't seen this film. Do it.** 




 The Stories of Dunk and Egg is the story where Bran gets to live his dream of being a knight. Warging Hodor's great grandfather, meeting Bloodraven in his physical prime.
The Sworn Sword: "It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior. Was there a god of fools?"
Remember where you heard it first. 




 * Tyrion claiming Casterly Rock. 

* Daenerys saving the world, in some manner.

* Arya getting to cross off some names on her list. And preferably some Bolton and a certain Frey.

 Yeah

Focus on the ones that is NOT "test this" or "test that". 

 




 I reinstalled everything with MechJeb as the only mod. 

NOW IT WORKS

Time to see if my old savefile will work, watch a lot of docking tutorials on MechJeb rendevouzing and docking! :)

Thank you all for you help. This is what internet is all about.

 




 I'm gonna try a fresh install install tomorrow, really gotta go sleep. 
Thank you for your help! I will get back when I have reinstalled everything. 




 Yeah I tried them, but it won't execute them either. :( 




 It's too large to host at pastebin. Dropbox, why didn't I think about that lol.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/lm2vx550b0tzv7r/output_log.txt?dl=0

here you go. That's a lot of text.. 




 No change :(

http://imgur.com/Gm2TC8z,BdBRgfw#1

Thank you all for answering.. Would really like to get this working.. 




 I posted a thread, but didn't get a sollution, so here goes.

Installed MechJeb for the first time. But it doesnt execute maneuver nodes.
It gets to the target altitude, firing stages and doing gravity turns.

But when it get out of the atmosphere, nothing more happens.

http://imgur.com/GbtAZlt
picture is past the node and on the way down. 




 No it doesn't make any corrections after leaving the atmosphere and change to "Autopilot Status: Coasting to circularization burn". 

Just goes past and downward after that. 




 I had a complete ship with batteries and solar panels, but when it didn't work the first time I made a new save file in sandbox to see if it was a technology problem. Didn't put that much effort into the test rocket. 

The speed was probably due to "limit to terminal velocity".

Added stuff electrical stuff, and changed the turn shape a little.

New picture shows altitude at 62 000 km. past the node at 75 000 and now descending.
Still not working. :(

http://imgur.com/GbtAZlt 




 It will be remembered, but if he doesn't finish it, it will not be a good thing to remember. 

If he finish it, R+L=J and he connects all the dots and make the ending really epic I think it will be as big as Lord of the Rings. 




 Yeah, after the first try I thought it would be the electrical. But after 10 tries I am pretty sure it's not that...

http://imgur.com/pf2aLfG 




 SOLVED!



I'm tired of launcing and rendevouzing so I just installed Mechjeb.
Got it to work, it is great at getting in the air.

Although it won't work entirely. It creates a node at apoapsis, but just goes right past it without buring. 

Autopilot Status: "Coasting to circularization burn". and it says so until the shit hits the fan (ground).

I have RCS, 3 kerbals and a little fuel left in my mainsail and a third stage ready. I don't get it because it manage to drop first stage, do the gravitational turn and set the manuever node at set orbit altitude.
But it won't execute the node.

Anyone have any ideas? This is so frustrating! 




 I read Arya, Jon, Daenarys and Tyrion chapterwise from book 3 - 5. It's awesome to do when you already read them a couple of times.  




 Catched that last week during my re-listening :) 
People who discredit R+L=J are just.... well. Stupid. 




 I **hate** being one of those persons posting a thread with the name of the next book in the title. But I have no choice.

Just read an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor) where he said:
"**We** have a season off and we have a year's hiatus, solely because I imagine our storyline is up to the end of the books," 

The whole interview here:
https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/24890664/actor-kristian-nairn-reveals-the-other-side-of-hodor-on-game-of-thrones-themed-dj-tour/

As he said "**We** have a season off" I guess that means his gang. That be Hodor, Bran and Meera. Oh, and Brynden "Bloodraven" Rivers ofc.

They totally have rushed Bran's storyline and I would never have suspected they would pause his story for a whole season, that seem really weird considering the huge twist at the end.

if they now feel they should take a break with Bran for a season because there is no more book material. Is that an indication that **The Winds Of Winter** could well be released 2015? Maybe in time for season 5 to end, or worst case before season 6 airs?

If there were no chance George would have the book out before season 6 is well under way I see no reason what so ever to delay Bran's storyline at all. Just make him a flashback-machine.

I take delaying of story as a good sign. That should mean they feel **hope.** And that is good enough for me.

However I am glad. I don't want weirwoodspoilers in the show.
And I am sure we will get clarifications from D D what the holdup is all about soon enough. 














 Theory about the powers of the Weirwood trees and Bran's extreme warg abilities.

Spoilers D E

I read The Sworn Sword on the plane just before, and smiled a lot when I read the part where Dunk defies his former liege and sends his soon to be slaughtered smallfolk home. 
The reason for my smile was Dunks monolouge after his outburst:
 "It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior" 
"Was there a god of fools?"

"not the warrior" felt a little out of place, and got me thinking towards the old gods. 

We do know about someone who can control people. And we know someone who wants to be a Knight more than anyone. 

This could well be wishful thinking and another crackpot theory. BUT IF Bran theoretically could Warg someone in the past (weirwood magic seems pretty craycray you got to admit) do you have a better candidate than Dunk the lunk, thick as a castle wall? 
I bet we will know if it's the jetlag, or if I'm on to something in Winds of Winter and or The Shewolves Of Winterfell. 

In any case, I think Dunk and Egg is really important to the story of the novels. He began writing the novellas between agot and acok I believe. 

My first ever Post on reddit BTW!
