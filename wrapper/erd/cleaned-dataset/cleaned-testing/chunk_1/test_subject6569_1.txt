 I would recommend that links to the actual leaks here not be included. Discussion is what is really desired (at least for me), but the links allow them grounds to delete the links in their subs to this one. Anyone can do a google search and find them quite easily without too much instruction.

I agree 100%. 




 The response I posted in the other thread:

I do understand the sentiment even though I suspect it's a bit hypocritical. I doubt that out of all of the mods over at /r/gameofthrones, none has watched the leaked episodes... Well, it's a moot point.


I guess there's just one thing to do:**Whenever you see anyone over in /r/gameofthrones (or any other sub) ask about a place to discuss the leaked episodes, send them a PM to inform them of this subreddit.**


That way only people *overtly* looking for a discussion are told of this place and the mods over at /r/gameofthrones can rest assured that this sub is only "advertised" to people who want to take part in the discussion.

 Yeah, me too... 




 Do that. 

I understand and respect their decision to not allow any discussion of the leaked episodes on /r/gameofthrones but at the same I would like them to acknowledge that people *will* watch them and *will* want to discuss them afterwards, to pretend anything else would be naive. 

Why not give viewers a sub where they can do just that? It would drastically cut down on spoilers in /r/gameofthrones and it would give subscribers a clear decision: Want to watch the leaked episodes and discuss them afterwards? Head over to /r/piratesofthrones. Want to watch the episodes as they air and remain spoiler-free? Stay in /r/gameofthrones! 




 By the same logic they could ban ASOIAF wikis. I don't think they should have to keep their subscribers safe from spoilers *outside of their own sub*... 




 Some one mentioned /r/piratesofthrones in a comment in the "Episode leaks, Spoilers and Piracy" sticky thread.

I responded to them with this:

I wouldn't be surprised if your post were deleted - it's what happened to the only other post I saw mentioning another such subreddit.
I would be interested in the mods' reasoning behind this. I understand and support their decision to keep /r/gameofthrones as spoiler-free as possible but it seems like sending people to another sub for the discussion of the leaked episodes could only help that goal!

A couple of minutes later both our posts had been deleted. No explanation by the mods. The only explanation I can come up with is that the mod team doesn't want people to fuck off to other subs but that would be incredibly petty...

Thoughts? 




 Right you are. Thanks for refreshing my memory! 




 It's been so very long since I read the books so I'd appreciate it if someone could refresh my memory:

Is that how Mance dies in the books? This scene seemed very unfamiliar to me. Also, it seems like they completely changed Tyrion's story line or am I remembering that wrong? Was Varys with him in the books?

 I agree - sex is an important aspect of a romantic relationship and you're not helping anyone by staying in a relationship with someone who won't/can't fulfill you sexually.  




 Good idea, a separate subreddit will help keep /r/GameOfThrones as spoiler-free as possible!

Upvoted for visibility. 




 Serious question:

I understand that the uploader blurred the watermark but wouldn't HBO alter something (e.g. a tiny blip in a random frame) unique to each screener so that if it leaks they could find the guilty party?
