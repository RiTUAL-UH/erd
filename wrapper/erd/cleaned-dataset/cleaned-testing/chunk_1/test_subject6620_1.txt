 Best looking vehicle with a Subaru badge on it. I've got to go back to [this] (http://www.motorstown.com/imgs/18020-subaru-svx-2.html) in order to recall any other Subaru as visually stunning.  




 You should drop Mendenhall. There has got to be another way to fill that roster spot with someone that doesn't register 0 each week. Time to start scoring some points, man. 




 Being that you're in Chicago after all [unlawful intent can be presumed] (http://thefiringline.com/library/blades/knifelaws.html) 




 Not the most exciting roster spot to add, but consider the Cardinals D/ST. They shut down Vick and the Eagles weapons last week, and are going up against a struggling Miami offense. 




 Livable wages   fair medical benefits would be the first of a number of reasons. Unionized commercial food workers can make around $16-17 per hour for the jobs that Walmart workers get paid $9-10 an hour for.  




 The ice rink at Millennium Park would be a great option in late November. Zoo Lights in Lincoln Park = free. Ride the Ferris Wheel if the two of you aren't afraid to shiver a little.   




 Perhaps the Gangster Disciples near Division   Pulaski should consider moving to a more friendly community. So many of their neighbors are of the insane/maniacal variety. 




 Any game that the Hogs play against the Wolves will either be televised on Comcast or MY50 for Chicago locals. The way AHL's scheduling is structured that's probably 8-10 games this season 




 Sometimes stickers come in cow shapes and chicken shapes too. That's protein for ya!
 




 Perhaps Cutler could be more of a said bitch if he went to play for the Wings and remained a mediocre defenseman on their squad until he is 67 years old. 




 This has got to be one of the lesser liked Illinois or Cook County cops. They gave him a 2004 Malibu! 




 Inappropriate. There is no way that the Pentagon is that close to New York!  




 James's turn:

      C   O   C   K
          H
 




 No brainer. Forte   Spiller/Martin could all start ahead of a wildly unpredictable Johnson. 




 I find it more offensive that the Canucks are #3. First, their logo can simply be classified as stupid. Additionally, the huge VANCOUVER letters are obnoxious. Lastly, they borrowed the color scheme from the 1990s Seahawks. #3? Seriously? 




 For most of the mid 90s until about 2006 these jerseys were about the only thing the Hawks had going for them.  




 What did the 911 call sound like?
 




 It's a bit crazy. I've thought about proposing some trades for depth. Trading away the guys that you drafted early makes no sense though. Why pick a RB/WR1 and not show the confidence to keep him on your roster? 




 Looked at the title too fast and thought "He bought steak at Giordano's!?" ...but hopefully this helps the owners get it together.  




 Guy is alone because of the Detroit Vipers jersey. 




 How the hell is Jamaal Charles on waivers in your league?
Seems like you're dominating a league of inexperienced players. Have fun winning. 




 Change Portage Park to Polish Park.  




 Svengoolie was at his best in those years that it aired @ 11pm on WCIU! 




 Saddest moment in Berwyn history: http://chicagoist.com/2008/05/03/berwyn_spindle_1.php 




 Gone are the days when the Wolves were the only independent club in the IHL; I miss that. It's partly said "business" and partly the growing emphasis on the AHL being a developmental league. It seems that the number of veterans a club is allowed keeps shrinking. 

But with an impending lockout there is a great deal to be excited about this October! The roster will be stacked, and Wendell has brought Haydar and Sterling back together too.    




 I second this. The wolves are more of their own entity than most AHL teams. 

As far as the Ice Hogs go... thanks for Andrew Shaw. Nothing else positive to say about that organization. 




 Terrible luck!
 
If you go to Velasquez   Sons they can replace a catalytic converter way cheaper than most. It was 2006, but I got one for $90 parts and labor.  




 Even funnier is the ad box on the tribune's page: 

"Single? Meet local older women for free!"
 




 AHL gets no coverage in the states either. Chicago Wolves are the only team that televises all of their games, and it's local coverage only.  




 Way too much credit being given to Americans with this. This is assuming that they know of at least 10 countries in this region and can identify their shapes. 




 AHL during the last lockout was damn good. Guys like Vanek   Cammelleri ,that normally would have made NHL squads, played and tore things up. I remember watching my Wolves get destroyed in the finals by a team that featured Patrick Sharp, Jeff Carter, Mike Richards, Umberger, Nittamayki, and more.  




 Since it is a 2-way deal they should be able to. 

The circumstances were different in 2004-2005, but young NHL players like E.Staal and Spezza went down to the AHL after playing full seasons in the NHL. 




 Not over Sproles. Even though Sproles may get less than 10 carries, he has the potential to grab ~8 passes and rack up big yardage. Gerhart my get the same amount of touches, but his ceiling isn't nearly as high.  




 For a 10 team league this is terrible depth at RB.  




 Satisfyingly evil-looking.  




 Is it? Shouldn't it be "woman's best friend." Not "women's"
Nobody is saying "men's best friend." 




 So I'll refine my question and eliminate the loaded term "genocide." 

What is the proper historical legacy of Japanese war crimes (and crimes against humanity) that included: mass killings, human experimentation, biological warfare, and undeniable torture during the time period I mentioned? 




 This must be your life...

 This is really informative. I have found historian, Herbert Klein's book on the Atlantic Slave Trade very eye-opening in many respects to slavery's practice on an international level.

 Sometimes referred to as the "Asian Holocaust," some historians cite a number of ~30 million Chinese, Filipinos, Malays, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Indonesians and Burmese dead a the hands of Japan during this time period.

 What other city is this killer-friendly. At least Detroit is showing it can be an attractive place for at least one group of people. 




 "The Great Encounter of China and the West" D.E. Mungello. 




 Not a female, but I'm going to guess that women hate denim shorts the most. (on men)

Weirdly enough there are tons of denim shorts on women out there, why does this make sense?
 




 I've been a good sport and worn all of the clothes that my girlfriend buys me. Even purple shirts but I will absolutely draw the line at pink! 




 This is staggering stuff: http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/chalmers-johnson/the-looting-of-asia

How can we diminish the importance the potential lowest point humankind has ever reached. The actions of Japan during the 1930's and 1940's brought about what is perhaps the most widespread suffering the world has known.  




 No way! I've never under-appreciated this dude since I learned about him in sixth grade. 

We've literally taken a crap on his legacy... Well, I guess that was point of his invention.   




 Rosalind Franklin... but that may be too easy as well because of all the posthumous recognition. 

I'll go with significant, not necessarily great, Robert Oppenheimer.  




 Anything about 9/11 

OR 

when James Dobson insisted that Spongebob is making kids gay. 




 Did she take your reputation into consideration when she cheated on you? 

You have no moral responsibility to respect the confidentiality of someone who showed absolutely no respect to you.  




 It has been a long journey for this guy since playing in Texas trailer-parks. 

Now he's playing for ~$10million (American); so much to like about this guy's style of play. He ought to be a great fit.   




 You must have been that girl from Venezuela. 




 The dude's aura communicates so well. 




 Morrow   Hartnell are actually pretty clear to spot. 




 Wish I had been alive--or they would bring back--the NASL. Hockey fans would love it. MLS just is not that exciting. The NASL was able to lure big names like Pele and superstars from Europe. Plus they had probably the most intense post-regulation elimination shootouts. 

Shooter gets 5 seconds to take the ball ~40 yards   crack one on goal. Goalies can charge shooters, sit back, or get caught in no-man's land. Equally intense to the hockey shootout. Check it out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJEnwi7otu0  




 Uh. I think you mean that Chicago is like Toronto except Chicago has 10 times as many murders. But, otherwise a Canadian ought to love it here. Be smart and bring your own maple syrup.   




 interested. what time on sunday 9/2? 




 I would be interested for sure. 




 My '02 had problems with the Pass-Lock Security system that also made the ignition lock up   refuse to start. More info/solutions to this common problem with the Grand Am: http://www.bergerweb.net/grandamsecurityfix.htm 




 Or... keep it; instead of a 2 min penalty being assessed to the goalie, he becomes a skater who is allowed to handle the puck. However, being that he is outside the trapezoid/ goalie zone, the rules should allow for him to be bodychecked within the rules of checking any other puck-handling skater. I know my grandpa would love to see this, he suggests this every time he sees the damn trapezoid on tv. 




 Had to have been a Catholic/parochial school; being that it is evil to waste I was forced to eat the white, slime-based coleslaw by a nun. Not to mention the sandwich my brother's teacher fished out of the garbage for him.
