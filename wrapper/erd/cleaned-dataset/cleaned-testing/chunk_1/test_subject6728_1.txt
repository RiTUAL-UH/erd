 that's a good point too particular event or people. 




 So a connection to some particular event? yeah i can see that, thanks! 




 Yeah, uniqueness and power level of the game, i guess if everyone has it it become common. that's a good point 




 When i said no "story" answer i mean a comment that is just literally written "story"

yes stakes and hassle to get it. 




 Yes, thank you this is what i meant when i asked the question, characteristics that legendary things have

I think a "price" to pay for a legendary weapon is a must.

Also as you said the power level of the campaign matters too that's something to keep in mind too. 




 To you guys aside from stats what characteristics makes something considered epic or legendary and plz no answer like "story" please give an answer with some dept, if you want to use something you made as example i'm all for it.

As of now the characteristics i got are

Uniqueness

Means and stakes of obtaining it

Background story

The better, the worst, as in it's good but it's power comes at a price.

A connection to a certain event or people 




 I'm a Mage: the awakening player and alot of people recommend Ars magica to me, me being somewhat tired of Mage listened to some suggestions and Ars magica popped out more than a couple of time as some call it the predecessor to mage.

Are the more conceptual Arcana equivalent such as Fate, Time and so on still there or accessible in some way? or are the mages "weaker" in comparison to Mages from Awakening?

It seems a much more detailed system such as the labs and such which Awakening refuses to put in more detail about alot of things, which i understand but it takes me out of it somewhat.

Also a problem i had with Awakening such that mages seemed too alike magic wise by that i mean you had no reason to be "creative" in most situations and even then it was hard to set mage apart from one another as the player  has almost no way to go about being "creative" i'm having trouble explaining it so i don't except help here. 




 It looks really sleek, i like colored sheets,dude i would advise making a black and white one and a colored one i fucking love this design! keep it up! 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobilis

I haven't played Nobilis yet (can't find groups accepting people) so i'm reading the core, 3rd ed btw, is the one i'm reading, yh the one with cancerous art...but it's the newest so i went with that, don't know any better

I have general problems understanding the game but the attributes just pin me to the ground how do they work?!

Please explain them to me. 




 So i have been trying to make a magic system for fate core and this is by no means finished it's just an idea and i'm trying to get the idea of it before the mechanics, here's what i have in mind.

i thought of magic working like the materia from FF7 as in switch them and make them stronger through use, i have taken the habit to go to the super power wiki and taking a look at the powers and checking them out

Let me give you an example let's say the gm gives a player the following Materias:

Fire manipulation.

Then he chooses the applications

Applications would be the uses of the power you start with two of those and with milestones in game you would give the Materia (i'l get to that) access to more application, of course the gm dictates what is "legal" as an application because some of them have applications that could ruin a game.

So the players chooses these as he would choose aspects of sorts:

Create/Generate/increase,shape. (this counts as one, the gm might think otherwise tough)

Flame Solidification.

and he would choose stunts called techniques if he wants for ways to use these powers with greater mastery such as Pyrokinetic Constructs for flame solidification.

that's what i got for this step, it's not very well translated from what i have in mind but it's an approximation

Now i thought this stuff is way too op and it is ,so i decided that using Materia recklessly would make you go insane instead of using a mana sort of thing.

When a player fails to cast a Materia properly he rolls a skill that the gm finds appropriate, the player is encouraged to give suggestions to the gm as in what skill he should roll, to circumvent a disaster.

the gm says what could happen as in what the calamity would be either bad for the caster or for people around him.

Example: The Player with the fire Materia tries to fling a fireball at someone,he rolls, he fails , so the gm says "well, you have a big fireball in your hand and it's about to blow up in your face and burn everyone around you, you lost control of the flames."

The player might suggest "i want to use my WILL to stop the flame from blowing up by concentrating to appease the flames " 

The gm agrees, next time this happens he might choose another way the spell could go wrong always withing the powers of the Materia tough. the player rolls he succeeds but what if he had failed? well the player could use a fate point to negate any negative implications or endure the consequences, this might seem way to cruel but with the appearance of more powerful Materias this is a must.

But of course the gm is expected to offer worse implications to botching a power of greater magnitude as in things getting way way worse for having greater power means greater possible destruction.

Botching a spell completely makes everything go bat-shit crazy and that includes you for a while it scales with level of failure.

I have more but what do you guys think as of now?
