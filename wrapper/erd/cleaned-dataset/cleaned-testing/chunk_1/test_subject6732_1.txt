 Just yesterday I have seen this quote being credited to Anne Frank! 




 Yes, Gitanjali is absolutely *the* place to start Tagore. 




 They're really worthy.. especially Kindle Paperwhite, which has an inbuilt light as well... Amazon has provided many many classics in Kindle format for free.. That's really something worth mentioning and worth respecting.. It has an AMAZING and flaunty life.. And the best part (although not accurately a moral point) about Kindle is you don't have to really *buy* the books in Kindle editions.. You can just download those ebooks in *.mobi* format from torrents.. I mean, come on, we all download stuff from internet! 




 A couple of years ago, I was introduced to the real beauty of words through *Gitanjali* by Tagore. (And that day I understood what kind of Literary art forms are awarded Nobels in Literature)

Have you people read that book..? If so, how you liked it?? 




 very fuckin funny!! 




 Oh fuuuuuuckkk!!! It's awesome :D :D :D 




 Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca from *Angels and Demons* by Dan Brown 




 **STEPHEN KING IS A GREAT WRITER.** 




  it relates to the themes of finding beauty and meaning in the dull American suburbs. 

Does Beauty mean trying to work out and develop body so that he can fuck his daughter's classmate??

(Although, I liked the part when he doesn't fuck her at the end..) 









 Too good!! 




 Yeah great thought definitely.. The actual source was Thoreau's very influential essay **Walking**. 









 Well, that's a very good TIL stuff! Thanks.. 




 I guess, that's because they're too busy trying to be funny in their comments in order to get up-voted.  




 care to explain, anybody?? 




 no words!! 




 Oh wow.. you gave there a whole new website for quoted pictures.... lovely!!!  




 Awesome!! JUst outstanding... 




 thank you so much for posting this here.. awesome post!! 




 this quote is directly going to my twitter right now.... 




 Something!! 




 "He didnt like what he had seen so far of moneys influence, and who could blame him? So far as he could see, money corrupted whatever it touched. Money kept his mother waiting for buses that never came and prevented him from attending schools that could have brought out the best in him. Money put people on different levels, in a way he found unnatural.  And money caused people to forget the right reasons for doing a thing." ~Michael Lewis, NEXT 




 [These](http://www.rstudio.com/faq-items/connect-rstudio-oracle-database/) might help. Sorry, if they don't. 




 [This](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/files/scicomp/Dloads/RProgramming/BestFirstRTutorial.pdf) is the tutorial that I was following.. and 3rd chapter knocked me down.

Any help would be much appreciated.

 




 Interesting. The quote, and its author, Friedrich Nietzsche, both are interesting.  




 I put quotation marks around the word finished because I've discovered that finishing a fiction writing project is not like finishing a cheeseburger. I've had to come to a point where I am at some acceptable equilibrium between "I want this to be perfect" and "I can't fucking look at this thing again

Very well put.. Might as well start a new sub with the name r/AspiringWriterProblems 

*Hey, I mean it, ah!* 




 Since my childhood, something about sky always interested me.. The mystery in there, in the eternal space has kept me enchanted and left me wondering about what dwells there and beyond. Now, once and for all, I want to take interest in Astronomy.. please suggest me where to start. (by the way, I'm 25 and from India) 









 Well, that's a pretty fucked up attitude for a growing future citizen of this world!  




 That's shit sad.. really.  




 Isn't it great to be a nerd!! Using the mind, keeping it focused for something worthy... I can only feel sorry for those who thinks bullying them is fun!!  




 So can they be just beaten up by other kids??.. Is *that* a good social acumen for them?? 




 In what ways? 









 See this is what reasoning sometimes does.. ruins the feel out of it.. Anyways, we won't do any *bioluminescence* for whatever worthy we want to burn in our lives.. so we can be fine with the quote! 









 In such case, the best part would be to rather talk.. Speak in English with someone who is good at it and ask them to correct you whenever you err. As this goes on, you will not only become good at grammar but also the correctness in grammar will become a part of your sub-conscious; and with this, you will even realize and catch errors (if any) in something that you read or write.. 

When I was learning English language in my school days, we were not allowed to speak in any regional language(I'm from India). So, that is how I learned English, by talking it and correcting it whenever I erred.

Listen to audio books as well.. It will be very helpful!

Good Luck :) 




 * **On Writing** by Stephen King 
* **The Elements of Style** by William Strunk

are the most famous of all... 
 




 I too am an aspiring writer from a country where English is not the official language, India.. Luckily enough, I was able to pursue all my education in English medium all along.. 

Ok, now coming to the *Writing* part. To write a well is an art. And to create art, you ought to be *inspired..*  As you're saying that you're interested in writing, I would suggest you to recognize the kind of writing that inspires you... You should take it from the very basic level..

*Start reading quotes*, lots of quotes from lots of authors.. And I'm sure that will inspire you.. and then alongside, think back into your own past experiences that you feel are vital for your life, and try writing small quotes/sentences about them, whatever they would be, just write a sentence about it. Once you start doing this regularly, you will not only feel like writing more of them, but you will also unconsciously strive to write them more beautifully.. That's how you start recognizing the preciousness of the **art** that you possess.

And once you do that, you will automatically get to know what more to do to improve your style, flow and simplicity in putting the words together.. When you're well into such process, you will eventually build up confidence and you will know what would be the purpose of your writing.

This is what I learned by practicing writing since past 4 years.. I started with writing blogs (began with Blogger, and after all this time, recently switched to Medium.com).. At the begining, my writings had lots of grammatical errors, but after all these years, I'm able to write better, with very less grammatical errors, and above all, with a more inspired spirit in my writing.

*Note*: Read more. Once when you start reading quotes from the books, and when you stumble upon a really really really grand quote or sentence, sit back and think what would've resulted somebody in writing such a sentence.. and then try to read the book which the quote came from... This way you will understand the context behind beautiful words and sentences and believe me, you will desire to create such onces youself.

Even after doing all this, if your skill or ability as a writer doesn't change or advance, tell me, I will give you my address.. you can come and kill me! 




 If you're a girl, gift me this and I will marry you :D 




 Awesome!!!! :D 




 I didn't had to read *Harry Potter* when I was a teenager, but I did.. So when I had faced ethical problems later in my years, where I could've reacted unethically, I opted not to be so. I was good, because I chose to be. Reading those books taught me to be that way.

That's what this quote means.. *It says that something from the books you read will surely stick within your heart and will determine the way you will walk in the path of life when faced with adversities!*  




 Always liked this quote!! 




 Yeah.. the conflict itself loses sense without the Time thing!! 









  How much creativity was lost to WW2?

An interesting and thoughtful point, indeed! 




 World is a small place, pal! 




 Alongside loving books, I'm also an avid lover of book covers... If any of you have any favourite book covers or collected albums of them, plz do share them here. I really really want to look at the best bookcovers in the world!!

Thanks :) 




 Watching movies is fine... but I seriously think you should read books... any normal person who can't go out for a couple of years would sit and watch movies, because it is *easy*... 

**Don't be easy!**

Read books... and if you can do that you'll be proud of these two years more than any couple of years in your entire life... and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/) is where you would want to go if you pick up the habit.

(I'm not suggesting you to not watch movies at all, of course you should... all I meant was when you look back, I don't want you to have only *watching movies* as a significant pastime, that is all).

All the best, pal! 




  Every five years, like clockwork, I think of what an asshole I was five years ago

This is so cool one.. and

Before I do anything, I ask myself "would an idiot do that?" If they would, then I do not do that thing. -Dwight

This one too!! 




 Well, there is always a search engine these days, isn't there, pal! 




 That's the beauty of it!! 




 Some places on the internet this quote was widely attributed to Will Smith. 




 Very funny!! 




 Something! 




 This quote, even in the least bit, doesn't talk about fishing literally... So, you're peace from Fishing isn't going to be touched by this quote.. Chill :) 




 It is a metaphor that says people live all their lives doing things they are not even conscious about, they just survive and pass days in their lifetime... and then finally after their time is done, they go away without knowing what they lived for all this time.. 









 Oh.. OK.. I was just tying that in Reddit.. didn't do so in R itself. But thanks anyways.. Didn't knew this before :) 




 I'm a very newbie to R. I just found out that there are numerous datasets inbuilt into R's *datasets* package.

but when I tried to access them, I don't see anything.
For ex: when I type

data(Nile) //I have this 'Nile' dataset in the package

The data present inside it is not being visible. The prompt just goes to next line, and nothing happens. But in online examples they got the data when they typed a datasets name like: data(phones)

Any idea why am I not getting the data? 




 I like the way you presented it... like in UNIX :) 




 Oh How much I love this kind of posts!!!

**I request people to post the name of the writer who wrote the quote.**  




 awesome! 




 18! 




 Hey this is cool....!! 




 Deep! 




 Too deep.... depressingly deep, but at one corner, inspiring.
Thank you so much for posting it. 




 I think I read the book in a hurry... But yeah lots of great quotes.. 




 Nailed it, dude! 




 Life is weird. You go from being strangers. To being friends. To being more than friends. To being practically strangers again.

This is very nice. 




 That's a very thoughtful sentence!! 




 Good guy M.. 




 Stabbing sharp! I think it's really unfair to post such a great quote without crediting its writer.. So, I just found out that it is written by **Naeem Callaway.** 




 Just what I need... that too from my favourite non-ficition author!! 




 Funny.. but makes sense! 




 Deep! 




 Philip is one of a kind!! 




 Can somebody explain this?? 




 If it smells like shit everywhere you go, you better check your shoes. 

Very nice..

honey why is this whiskey bottle half empty? because you are a pessimist

Well, that's being too frank to your face. Awesome ofcourse!

Very nice list, friend! Thank you.. You should make more of these...

This is way powerful... Awesome! 









 I was actually thinking to do this specially for Gone Girl.. I was spellbound by Trent   Ross for their work in *The Social Network* and I'm also enjoying *Gone Girl* now... 




  8tracks

Never heard of this.. Will surely try.. Sounds interesting what you did. 




 Wow.. what a post... I really do... Moreover, I imagine and hum in my mind some Hollywood OSTs when reading some of the most important and influencing aspects in a story... It feels seriously enriching experience.... 




 I recently finished reading Michael Crichton's PREY.. and the closing line was deeply provoking:

"*They didn't understand what they were doing.*

I'm afraid that will be on the tombstone of the human race."



I felt interested in asking you people about such touching closing lines from other books.. Let's post/share such lines. Thanks! 




 I've very recently starting my career with first job by working with Informatica ETL processes.. I'm keenly interested in Data Science.. So, I want to ask you if there a way for me to eventually make a switch into Data Science? What is the necessary skill set that I would need to do so, and is working in Informatica tool going to be of any help to me in the journey towards being a Data Scientist?? 














 1984. It is said to be a timeless classic book in English Literature..  I started it some time long ago, nearly more than a month ago and am still not able to finish it. For me it is surely not a page turner. I'm just keeping up with it still because I feel bad when I start a book and decide not to finish it, so am just trying to read it page by page and find out if I can realize why it is such a classic.

There are many instances in the plot that seemed really senseless.. Winston, Julia and O'Brien... there is no proper relation between how they develop their opinions and feelings that they have for one another.. Why Julia loves Winston and a lot more such loose ends..

Can somebody please tell me why this 1984 is a classic?? 




 A dystopian time period... people living by a set of strange rules and practices... the protagonist character also lives as one among them all.... and then eventually he starts thinking differently... and then a girl character enters the story and that stirs him for even more revolutionary ideas and actions that protest against those time period socially accepted customs... 

I have observed the same plot line in very well known classics Fahrenheit 451, 1984, and also a novella Anthem (by Ayn Rand)... 

Now, why is that??  














 Truth be told, I'm heavily influenced by Inception film.. Ever since then, I am interested in lucid dreaming concepts.. I've tried to come up with interesting story lines... but whenever I start writing something.. After some time, inevitably I ask myself "How is this different from Inception, anyways?? Why would people want to read this when they've already seen all this in Inception?"

So I want to ask you people: Is it really possible to write a lucid-dreams fiction, whose concepts would appear new, while most of it is already covered in the Inception film in a very grand manner???

Please help me... 














 For me, it's every line from *The Social Network*. Every freakin' line, I tell you!

If I've to be really precise, I would pick:


"It's raining."

"I'm sorry."

"It just started raining." 




 I'm an aspiring writer, and I thought myself to be a fine amateur at Writing. But just today I came across [Medium](http://medium.com) and it was great, but the content I saw there overwhelmed me. Honestly and shamelessly saying, friends, looking at what and how good people are writing there, I found myself being far far from their quality. I'm deeply depressed from all the content I saw there and am feeling very underconfident about my Writing skills. Can somebody please help me?? Thank you! 




 Whenever I come across some books that have started a new sub-genre kind of thing in themselves (eg: Cyberpunk, Quantum Fiction and etc..) I feel very motivated.. I'm an aspiring writer and I want to write very different books that would completely stand out from the mainstream conventions of sci-fi or any categorizations of literature.. 

Any tips on how to invent a new genre/sub-genre in Writing??
 




 I'm reading **The Undercover Economist** by Tim Harford.. I'm a novice to economics, but am interested in learning it. So I picked up this book and am reaching its end right now. But there are many things in that book that left me in dark, many concepts seemed very unclear to me, especially the concepts like how game theory is used in auctions and lot more such things from that book. I understood some concepts very well and now am looking at those things differently in everyday reality. So, I want to also get the gist  of those concepts that I didn't understand clearly when I read them from the book. Can somebody please provide me with a link that has a detailed chapter vise summary of the book or any of your personal analyses of them?? It would be of *GREAT* help if you people can do that for me. Thank you! 




 All mylife I've been great at nothing, only good and ok at a few things. I'm very much fed up with such life style. I want to know how can i remove this mediocrity from my life forever. Tell me what kind of things I would need to do en route this path. (By the way, my ambition in life is to become a *great* writer! ) 




 The way the character Jordan Belfort talks in the movie is simply outstanding and really captivating.. the confidence in his words, his body language, his aggression, the articulation -- all in all his way of speech is everything that a person with "I-want-to-win-the-world" attitude needs!

I'm really impressed by all that.. I want to talk like him... How do I do that?? Any ideas and suggestions?? (By the way, I'm an Indian!) 




 Ive finished 100 days of abstinence and there is a specific viewpoint of mine that I want to portray today to the members of this brotherhood about the subject at hand, *the addiction.*

Along this time, Ive only, or at least mostly, seen people referring to masturbation as a completely negative thing in their lives and it ruining their vital time. People say its a demon that stops ones development in life and so should be killed. *I dont agree.* It should not be ended; it should rather be fought and conquered but never despised and killed, never; because the real meaning of victory is not killing but conquering. After all, what would we, the powerful Humans, the soldiers who man the eternal Universe residing within each of us, do if there is no worthy opponent, if there is nothing standing between us and the ambitions we carry in our hearts? You can trek to the heights and watch the horizons only when there are mountains present in your way and blocking the view. So, I say your addiction (to masturbation or anything else) is not a prison that locks you up but a gym that strengthens you; and of course strength is only enjoyable when it is tested, not when it is rested. So it tests you, it weakens you, it hits you in the face, it hits you in the heart, it provokes you to fight back, and in the process it makes you stronger, it makes you brave, it makes you familiar to the hurdles again and again in the form of ups and downs, crests and troughs, so that when you encounter greater ones ahead in your life, you dont fear them anymore. Addiction can be an ocean of pleasure; you either learn to swim it and enjoy the dive, or fall straight in and drown away into its depth; choice is yours; and in both the above cases, ocean is not to the blame. A gymnasium is presented to you but working out in there is solely your duty. Don't offend your addictions, overrun them.

After 100 days of staying away from PMO, especially masturbation, this is all Ive realized about it. I wont hate it, I cant hate it; because it gave me intense pleasure since my puberty and I cant deny that. So, I stopped seeing it as an enemy, I never saw it as an enemy, I only saw it as a competitor, as an opponent, who irks me to dare win against it. 

I started my abstinence not at all because I was an addict of masturbation, but because its very valuable and enjoyable to me and I wanted to sacrifice such blissful pleasure for a goal that I took up in my life, like leaving the joy and comfort of home and going to the war to achieve my goal. That day was the start, and today it is 100 days; and this is just the beginning. 

*Thank you all, for your unstopping support to many brothers like me here, justifying the name, a brotherhood!* 




 Last year I had A lot of free time.. so I managed to read some 35 books in that year.. that's the biggest number ever for me, till date. Now I'm into my first job theses days. Moved into a new city and new time shcedules and stuff liek that... But these days, after entering into the actual career I'm observing that I'm not reading like before at all... I'm unable to enjoy the reading like before, too. My reading list has increased massively. I love to read, I bought more 20 books from a bookslae and lot of ebook downloads for my Kindle, but besides all this I'm not understadning these new changes in my reading habit and how to cope up with it.. Any suggestons and views?? 




 I see only boys making posts and replying the threads over here. I am wondering if this page is having only male members.. and eventually that made me question myself if we, the MEN, are the weakest Human species when it comes to lust related activities, which is why we needed a whole internet community here to abstain ourselves from PMO!!

Do girls ever, like *EVER*, suffer this PMO related things like us, at all?? 




 Recently there was a conservation going on with my friend about porn and masturbation and I mentioned to him that I took break from all those things. 

Friend: Why don't you masturbate?

Me: Just like that, took a break for a while.

Friend: Whatever happens won't you masturbate?

Me: No. I won't.

Friend: What if a very sexy girl comes to you? You won't fuck her? 

Me: No.

Friend: Won't you even masturbate thinking about her?

Me: No.

Friend: Why? Don't you have a dick??

Me: *I do. And I also have dignity in my dick.*




I felt very good about myself after I said. 




 I've always had this doubt inside my mind and now I started watching Carl Sagan's **Cosmos** hence this rose again in me. Now I can't stop asking this to the world, once and for all:

When we talk about the Cosmic entities such Planets, Solar Systems, Stars, Galaxies and etc, we talk in light years.. We, the human beings never even have set foot on the farthest planet even in our own solar system, but we diligently talk of numerous Galaxies apart from our own as if we have a crystal clear knowledge of them. 

When we haven't been to any of the other planets or to any farther than our own solar system, how the hell can we say that we are this much far this this galaxy and that much far from that galaxy??

 Not just that, anything and everything that is being told about the cosmic universe by our science, how can we be so sure about it all?? For example, in the Cosmos TV Series, *Ryan Nebula* is said to be **ONLY** 1500 Light Years away from Earth.. How on earth can we even envision, sitting here on this planet, about something that requires one to travel for 1500 years at the speed of light?? 

How in the world do we know all these things? I beg for the answers!!

 




 I'm a blogger and book reader.. For some of my future ventures I need an extensive knowledge of various systems, including how the society works, how an organization works, how corporate works and stuff like that.. So,  I want to start observing them and learn from them. But there is so much that happens around them all that I often get lost in thinking what to observe and take into account. 

Can somebody pleaes suggest what kind of observations of the world or a system are vital for understanding those systems in depth? 




 Although all sci-fi movies aren't good, their sound tracks can sometimes be captivating. I'm collecting such grand and enigmatic tracks from sci-fi movies. Please give out the names of those movies that you've felt as having great sci-fi tracks.

My personal favourites: TRON Legacy, Oblivion, Inception...

 I love to read books.. and then one day, just like that, I also discovered erotica (erotic stories) and started to love the kinky ones..!! I would even go further and say that I was once addicted to them than to the actual porn.. 

Now, I'm into NoFapping.. I'm on my 70+ days without fapping. But recently, as I started exploring Reddit, I found those subreddits that are very closely related to the kind of erotica I used to read.. and was kinda into them for a couple of days on the weekend.. I broswed through lot of captioned pictures on reddit and some real life stories...

I realized this is wrong too and am again trying to keep myself away from them like I did when started NoFapping a couple of months ago, although I didn't reset my badge right now because I **did not** masturbate at all!!

So, plz tell me does reading erotica, watching related captioned pictures and feeling aroused comes under Porn?? 




 I love to read a lot and I also chose to do so in my life because my future dreams are related to me reading varaciously. But I don't read so fast like many poeple and that makes me low sometimes.. Any of you with similar issues, friends?  I would like to be helped with some suggesstions too!! 




 I very recently bought 'Mein Kampf' by Adolf Hitler, published by Wilco Classics. It was a leather bound edition for a very less price, for just Rs.275 (less than $6). I was impressed by the hard binding, quality of the paper and the print. Out of curiosity I then browsed for other books from Wilco. Fortunately, I found lot of other books, all leather bound/hard cover editions and at prices even lesser than the one I mentioned above.

But to my surprise, none of the books are rated/reviewed (in Amazon). This made me wonder whether these books from Wilco Classic Library are of people's interest or not.

What do you people think of them?? Are there any particular disadvantages if one collects Wilco Classic editions?? 




 I see a number beside people's posts and comments in this NoFap section.. Can somebody tell what that represents?? In case it is the number of days the subscriber is away from fapping, is there any way that I can start the number from 60 plus, because i've been away masturbating since a couple of months.. To look at the number of days is kinda inspiring and encouraging to continue that way!!
