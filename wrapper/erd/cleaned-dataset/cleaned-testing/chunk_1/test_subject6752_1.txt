 I have lived there a year and paid a lot of late fees because my job keeps witholding and fucking with my pay. I couldn't save at all because I was paying sometimes 40 a month extra in late fees because of my job. I have also recieved three 10 day eviction notices. The first was for being 10 days late, the second for seven, the third for 2. I had never missed a payment, only paid late. My landlord recently broke my car window and has done nothing toward paying for it. I only have until 10/15 left in the lease and last rent is due 9/15. The entire length of my tenancy the management company has been shady and rude and I don't believe I will see a dime of ny security despite making no damage. I am not worried about future tenancy as I will be living with my parents for some time from then on and can use them to get a new apartment down the road if need be. 

What will happen if I don't pay? 


































 I'm new here and don't know a whole lot. My girlfriend recently took up MK and I like a lot of the products, but are they actually good for skin? I like microdermabrasion and botanical effects. 




 What do you guys like and dislike? Our anniversary is coming up, and my girlfriend and I want some new toys. We have been looking at RodeoH for me and Velvetnest for her. Anyone know anything about them or any other preferences? 









 We have been together just shy of four years. She has PCOS and has yet to find a perfect birth control to treat it. The current one has her extremely nasty and she claims depressed but I don't know. 

Last night, I got stuck late at work and therefore late to pick her up. She knows I am working on getting a raise. She called my mother and they each called me several times trying to find me. The exact situation happened a week ago. I told her that she is mauling me and she got pissed at me for worrying her.

She will not get her driver's license, leaving me responsible for transportation of both of us.

My mom is disabled and doesn't socialize much except with me and my girlfriend. My girlfriend often ignores her in favor of reading books despite the fact that my mom has bent over backwards for her. (Buying work uniforms, letting her move in at 17, etc).

I wake up early in the morning for work and she works second shift. I spend free time with my mom as I only get one and her poor health means I need to treasure the time I get. She always complains about being tired and wanting to go home when she gets far more sleep than I. 

We used to be very sexual. We would have sex twice a day everyday the whole first summer we were dating. We haven't had sex in a month. I ask and get either maybe or we'll see or I'm tired. I hate being rejected. Mostly I hate when she spends the day trying to grope me and make out with me AT MY MOMS HOUSE and then sleeps when we get home.

We are going away in October for our 4th anniversary. I took a day and a half off work for it already. She has yet to request it. I don't even know if I want to go. We were going to announce our engagement after this trip. I don't know if I want to promise another week never mind the rest of my life.

She promised we wouldn't go to her abusive father's wedding. (He abused us both when we lived with him briefly.) Then she told them we would. Now we aren't because it's the weekend before our anniversary and she can't get two weekends in a row off. She still hasn't told him she isn't going to attend. 

I really do love this girl. We have been together since high school. I just don't know where to go from here.

TL;DR girlfriend is being unusually psycho and I don't want to stay but I don't want to leave either. 
























 Theu played hockey with the poor little guy amd cleaned him thoroughly. He was fine. Theu were ashamed. It was very adorable in the end after a horrifying beginning. 









 My Moxie, who is probably around 2, has had labored breathing and been barely moving since at least 8 this morning. She is hanging on and her cage mate Roxie keeps checking on her. I have accepted that she is likely dying, but is there something I can do to help her? 









 One who saves you personally. 














 On /r/parenting, people talk about cosleeping in a positive way. We know cosleeping is dangerous. Babies get rolled on, and babies roll or fall of beds. Having a baby in bed also destroys intimacy in the parents' relationship. It is hard to get a kid to stay out of your bed anyway. If you let them for a long time then stop them, it'll be thay much harder later, further destroying intimacy. Basinets are not a huge inconvenience. Keep it by your bed to make feeding easy. They are small enough that they fit nearly anywhere. There are also basinets that get attached to the bed. Cosleeping should always be discouraged and absolutely never encouraged. CMV. 














 On October 10th we will be together for four years. Their wedding is October 4th. 

They got married already and are now having a big wedding. They waited two months before accidentally telling my partner that they got married. 

They have out right stated that they dislike me and that our relationship is invalid. We aren't sure if it is because I am female or if it is personal.

It is a semi themed wedding. My partner is to dress for the theme while I am not.

Despite the fact that we have been together two years longer than them, our invitation was addressed to my partner and guest. They know my name.

Are we being petty or is this just icing on the rude cake that is her parents?

**tl;dr**: Father in laws. Girlfriend wouldn't exist without him, and he won't go away.  
























 You guys are really turned on by WBC. 









 I am overweight, hefty, whatever you prefer. I got an exercise trampoline to help change that. After having been swimming a lot lately and generally eating better, I decided to jump on it today, not for the first time. I jumped twice and metal flew from the side and scared the hell out of my cats. 

TL DR too fat to work out, not fat enough to be confined to a bed.

Edit: Thank you all so much for being encouraging! I start my next semester of college on August 25th and since we have a new campus, I get access to a great gym facility that I plan to use. I'm going to keep at it and maybe be able to show you guys some before and after in a few months.  



















 Half a case of Lager in my fridge and I can't stand the taste. 














 Ask whatever. 




 I work for an agency to transport a developmentally delayed man to and from work and to take him to activities. Currently, my car is unsafe due to the lack of these parts. My brother and father are willing to install the parts, I just can't afford them right now. I am on food stamps and extremely hard up. If you can find the parts for the car (1999 Plymouth Neon) cheaper and wish to send me those, feel free. Anything at all helps. PM for shipping info if interested.

 It is up to mod discretion and I have been deleted in AskWomen because the mod fucking DISAGREED with me. I'm sorry but if you can't handle reading words on the internet you need to be in a bubble. It is total bullshit that people are so offended by words that they are deleted. It just gives the words more power. Grow the fuck up. And un fucking subscribe to AskWomen and their asshole mods. 



















 A few bad apples can spoil the whole bunch. The reason for not wanting them to be there in the first place is people who choose to expose their non female genitals in what is supposed to be a female space. Take Mich Fest for example. Many women there are victims of violent sexual assault. They are choosing to be in a space they feel is safer. As a women only space they should not have to worry about seeing male genitals. Pre op stealth women would not want to be outed and so would be extremely unlikely to even accidentally expose themselves. Post op transwomen have no.male genitals to show. In order to keep people more comfortable, a female space should be just that. People who are male do not belong their if they risk hurting female women even emotionally. 

Disclaimer: I am not debating whether or not trans women are women. They without a doubt are regardless of stage of transition. The issue is whether or not out transwomen who are pre op or non op belong in a space meant for females to feel safe. 

TL DR a penis free zone is a penis free zone. Cmv. 









 I am a transmasculine genderqueer lesbian. I am 19 and live in an apartment in the Poconos with my girlfriend of almost 4 years and our 11 pets. What would you guys be interested to see in a youtube vlogging channel from me? If you post specific questions, I will answer them in the video. 














 Hosted my brother's graduation party last night. My uncle in his 60s buys a case of lager to split between him, my other uncle, and my cousin. They only get through half so he leaves instructing my older brother to inform me that it's mine and to put it in the fridge. I don't like beer from my limited Rolling Rock experience and I don't have friends to drink with. 




 There is a reason you aren't legally allowed in Central Park after dark. If you choose to go in anyway and are raped/mugged/attacked/murdered, you knew the risk of going into the Park.

We all know that date rapes happen. If you leave your drink completely unattended and then choose to drink from it again, you are partially responsible as you are the one who chose to put something rather unknown into your body.

Bullies currently heavily target out gay kids. If you "pass" for straight and choose to be out in school, in part, you brought on the harassment. You knew the risks.

I know that breaking the law doesn't give others a right to harm you nor does making any other potentially poor choice, but if you know the risks and follow through anyway, you aren't totally innocent. 

TL;DR: choices have consequences. CMV. 





























 Has anyone done this before? I've never even been to the city. Any advice you could offer would be great. 









 I have been with my girlfriend and out as a lesbian for almost four years. A friend of ours invited us (well actually she told us we were going not asked) to a picnic with her family this weekend. We were happy to go until she informed me and my girlfriend we can "be out just don't hug or kiss or touch and don't act like you are dating". She askef my gf if she is okay wiyh it and my gf is a bit of pushover and was like oh yeah sure. However I am pissed. I went through a shit ton of crap for the right to be out. Like I had food thrown at me and was slammed into lockers and walls and just about pushed down the damn stairs. This girl knows all of this and yet she had basically told me to hide it. I cannot believe it. I have been nothing but supportive of her (she is a lesbian) and my girlfriend and I know how to behave. But for us to not be allowed to hold hands or anything is insulting. Now we are stuck going to this picnic and I don't know what to do. Am I overreacting? Should I still go?

TL DR: been out for 4 years. Friend wants my gf and me to hide us being a couple and gay for a picnic. Advice? 




 I work split shift for between five and eight hours Tuesday through Friday and tutor a kid when it fits with my work schedule. My partner works around 15 hours a week at a restaurant on weekends with extra shifts sprinkled in. Since the semester is over, we have a lot more free time. I desire to get things done. We need to be finding ways to make more money so we can get out of our really shitty financial situation (a near eviction, no car insurance, power over 1000 dollars late and due to be shut off, no food, etc.). I work from 8 to 830 every morning. She usually comes with me. Lately, she has been either staying in bed, or, like right now, going back to bed. She went to bed at about 1 this morning so it isn't like she should be exhausted. She knows I don't want to mess up my extremely sensitive sleep schedule. She insists I lay in bed next to her until she gets up at some point between 10 and 11. She gets mad at me if I go to the bathroom. I really love her and want to marry this girl. I just hate spending my days in bed not even asleep. I either read or go on reddit and facebook all morning.

TL;DR: Life ain't nothin but sleeping girls and no money. 

















































 In Cultural Anthropology just now, I was reading the AskReddit thread about kids' lies. I laughed, audibly, at one of the stories. Incidentally, I laughed just after my teacher was talking about slaves. Now my class thinks I find slavery funny. 







































 Can provide a spare bed in my living room. Lesbian couple, ages 19 and 20, pm me if needed. 




 There is a person in one of my classes that is a transwoman, however, at least in that class, she is not out. I know she is trans in part because of her presentation and in part because I was told such by a mutual friend when I asked. I only asked because she is very feminine and is referred to by other classmates with male pronouns. We have only interacted once and I avoided pronouns. What should I use? 




 If it pertains, I live in Monroe county.

My girlfriend and I have lived in our apartment for 5 months as of March 15th. In that time, we have been late with payment because of waiting on paychecks but have always paid the 5 dollars per day charge. 

I work as a companion to a man with Down Syndrome. He had been in the hospital, so I couldn't get papers signed, so I couldn't get paid. My pay will be in on April 5th. I will be getting about 700 dollars. Our rent is 675. I made a partial payment the day after the rent was due this month of 150 dollars. My girlfriend lost her job and got a new one and had been waiting on new pay checks to come. Today, March 25, we came home to a 10 day eviction notice. Our lease does state that habitual late payment can result in eviction. When we made the partial payment at the real estate agency the lease is through, we explained the scenario and asked to be notofoed if there would be an issue. No one notified us until now. Any and all advice is of help. 




 Edit: My girlfriend and I started datibg at fifteen and sixteen. Now that we are 19 and 20, seeing one is important. We both liked her's so I have an appointment with him next month. Just wondering if this was common. 




 Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but you girls always answer stuff well.

Back ground on us: I am 19, she will be 20 in early April. We have been together 3.5 years. 

Background on Dad: He has been married to 4 different women. He married my girlfriend's mom, divorced her after about two years, ran away to Vegas to marry wife number 2, then had a big Catholic wedding a year later. Divorced wife 2, married wife 3. Married wife number 2 AGAIN in a secret wedding, and is now having another big wedding to her.

Background on my girlfriend and her dad's relationship: he left when she was 2. He saw her maybe once a year until she was 16. Then, like 2 or 3 times a year. She and I lived with him for 7 months until he threw us out to move in with wife #2 in her state, 2 hours away. He has since tried to force her to leave me and move im with him and force them to only spend time together despite her refusal since he is verbally abusive and controlling. 

He hates me. We are both expected to attend this wedding, and the wife wants my girlfriend to be a bridesmaid, despite only having seen her 4 times since she was 4. My girlfriend doesn't want to go. I really don't want to go. Do you guys think we are obligated? 
























 As a gq lesbian, I don't quite get it as it is. How does it work in general and is it different for transgirls? 




 I know this is pretty insignificant, but today I was on /r/AdviceAnimals and I eealized something really shitty. Every Scum Bag Steve post was ahout general douchey stuff. Every Good Guy Greg post is about general nice thing. However, every Scum Bag Stacy post is about either a girl being a "slut" or a bad mom, and every Good Girl Gina meme seems to be about her sleeping with the guy or being a good homemaker. Does anyone else see this? 














 I am FAAB genderqueer leaning male. For as long as I can remember, I have "felt" a penis, just been unable to see it. I'm just trying to figure stuff out. 





































































 Generally, guys aren't all that clean. And lack of sensitivity is a good thing because you last longer. And, while minimal, it does protect against some STIs.

Edit: thank you all for realizing I was serious and not trolling. Much more to think about for when I eventually have children.  





























 NSFW 









 What were some of your rules, who suggested it, would you do it again? 









 I'm FAAB. I have identified as genderqueer leaning male for almost 5 years now. 

From when I was a kid, I have distinct what I call "trans memories". For one thing, I remember trying to make an STP out of a toilet paper roll. I also remember trying to always have a reason to use the men's room. When I first saw the SVU Episode "Transitions", I cried because I thought that my parents had gotten me a sex change when I was a baby and wondering why they couldn't just love me as the baby boy I assumed I had been born as. 

I'm fairly certain that I am FtM. My family would not accept it. We've already discussed it. My girlfriend says that she would be very much okay with, but I don't think she would be okay with any bodily changes.

I'm wondering if, if I use Androgel, I can gain all of the effects besides facial hair. My family history is very limited body hair growth. My mom's brother's didn't grow facial hair until their thirties and it was then still very limited. My legs only need shaving once a month or less, as it grows so sparingly. Also, how much would my voice change most likely? 




 Added discussion, defend your choices, argue other people's. 




 Feel free to provide screen caps and such for examples. Also, do you frequen it and if so why? 









 Card games like Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity count, as do games like Kerplunk, Hedbanz, etc. 














 When I last left you guys, all was going rather swell. Sadly, since then, everything as fallen apart. Moxie, one of the girls, ate through most of the cardboard I used to make the split. I tried, since it had been a while with no fighting, to introduce them directly, and fighting immediately ensued. I haven't had the time since to work on making them a better divider, but once I do get some time, I'll be sure to let you all know. 









 So, I posted yesterday about introducing my kids with a homemade split cage. They initially fought (or tried) through the screen, but have since gone to seeming to almost ignore eachother. I am switching their sides periodically so they learn the scents, but I want to wait until they are sleeping side by side for a week before I put them all the way together since my boy is so young.  




 I want to breed some gerbils. I love mine, but I know that they will eventually die, so I want a little piece of them left. Also, some friends have said that they want gerbils, and would be good gerbil parents. I have homes lined up, and I am willing to keep any that don't get homed. 

I recently got a baby gerbil, I think about 1-2 months old. He is a little boy, he is solid very dark grey. I also have a pair of girls. One is blonde and and the other is grey and white. They are each in half of a split cage I made.

I used heavy cardboard wrapping paper tubes and window screen materials to make a divider. They can't seem to get through it. 

Wish me luck on this bonding! 














 [I was 17 and drunk for the first time when this happened. My girlfriend's father kept filling my cup with more cider, and I had never even had a sip before this. His girlfriend's six year old beat the living hell out of me.](/spoiler) 




 Also, did you ever get caught? What happened? 









 I am "blessed" with a 40HH chest. I have checked websites like Double Diva's and Casique, but no one seems to carry a bra in my size, particularly one with padding. I prefer padded bras as they hide my nipples more so. If anyone has a website that carries that size and they know it to be reliable, please let me know. 




 I have two female gerbils named Moxie and Roxie that I've had for about 9 months. I also have a little guy named Remy. I've had him for about a month. So far, he has bit me to the point of leaving a scar once, he has made Roxie bleed, and he has bit me hard a second time. They live in separate cages, but I want to breed them, so in a completely open cage without bedding, I was introducing him to Roxie. He doesn't seem to fight with Moxie as much. I got them from separate pet stores, no chance of relation.

I have tried placing their cages side by side, since Moxie is an escape artist, I don't want to risk her getting into his half if I were to split cage them. I have bought Remy special presents, including his own ball, a track to run it on, special treats, and various types of chew toys. He is still very shy and very nasty. 

How can I get him to be nicer?
 




 First ever post on reddit. 

When I was about 3 or 4, (I don't remember the first time) a neighbor kid of mine who was two years older, used to coerce me into doing inappropriate things with him. These started out just as him getting me to kiss him, and then lead to French-kissing, and further to eventually kissing and licking his genitals. He would tell me that if I told he would never talk to me again, and we were best friends. He also would say that if I didn't do what he wanted, he would tell his mom I started it or that I wasn't allowed in his rec room anymore. He had a captains bed, and, in my strongest memory, we were "hiding" in the part that goes near the wall while my brother played Nintendo 64 in the rest of the room.

I have always been aware of what happened to me as a kid. It was just the other day though that someone actually told me that it was abuse. I always pretty much just thought that it was just "kids being kids" or that I was willing. 

I must have been pretty young when it started, because I remember, very vaguely, my dad telling me that if anyone touched me or made me touch them, to tell him. I can remember at that moment wondering if the other kid counted, but I knew the other kid said not to tell.

Later in my life, when I was 13, there was a girl who I had been friends with for my entire life. She was 12. We knew we weren't supposed to, but we put on a DVD, I think it was American Pie, and she decided that we should try "stuff". The next day, for her birthday party, she told me that she told her other friend about all of it, and that her friend then wanted to join because they had done it before. I was pretty much terrified from the previous night, and I certainly didn't want her friend to know, never mind join. However, a few months later, I willingly fooled around with her, (the girl, not her friend), so I don't know if this can really count for anything, since I went back for more. 

I also recently realized that I have a large majority of "symptoms" per se of abused people. I have severe depression, despite the fact that I have a pretty good life. I am incredibly anxious all the time. I have been to the point of suicide more than once. 

What I want to know is, now that I am 18, can I get therapy without insurance? I live in PA. Also, does the second thing count for anything other than stupidity?
