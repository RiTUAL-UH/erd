 It's just holy water to test if they are demons. Someone there watches too much Supernatural. 




 I'm almost 50 and I still try to grab a little feeding when I can. Which might explain why I keep getting called into HR. 




 Which was the bad part, the chicken or the cuffs? And which came first? 




 Yeah, the right is so obsessed with Obama he is in their mind on every single thing in the world. Ebola? Obama's fault. Some folks in a place where there is a lot of turmoil kill some people? Obama is to blame and congress must investigate like 15 times.

Bush and 9/11 and anthrax? "Why don't you leave bush alone? America is at war, you can't criticize our president during a tragedy! Benghazi!" 




 The GOP is an apocalyptic cult, so they will follow to be sure. They will gladly throw US troops into a war and take US dollars to give to Israel (so much for bootstraps/etc) because they think god will pat them on the head and give them some virgins or something in the next life.

Cons - don't trust them. They put religion and money ahead of country and family. 




 It has less of a zing, like budweiser in plastic vs bottles. But, damnit, I like to have a choice! 




 Another responsible gun owner.... 




 They ate a pancakes family? Did they have blueberry eyes and strawberry noses? 




 LOL. Ole Dick played the "The liberal media is complaining about us because we are republicans". 

Suck it up, dick. I will say I am happy that he is just doing playboy interviews now and not screwing up the country and shooting people. 




 So now I have to pee in glass bottles when I am there? I dunno, never liked the flavor of plastic compared to glass. 




 Were they around and active before we invaded Iraq to save the US from certain invasion from Iraq?

Was there even Al Qaeda in Iraq before that?

Ah...Iraq. The right waves flags and crosses and talks about how the Americans who died there as though they died or were injured to save us all....and yet the only thing they died for was bush's  and the right's personal desire for war.

Go America! 




 So what does it mean that Obama handily won, twice?

Oh - that they approved of his job and the ACA. Got it. Thanks :) 




 I'll bet the right isn't too happy about this. Whether it is blacks/gays serving their country or being allowed to marry they are convinced that America is failing because we don't have a military and marriages like they envision in their heads.

I am sure they are praying right now for god to whip up a hurricane to punish some people over this. 




 So gays won't be able to convert kids anymore in schools by promising them free ipods with Judy Garland songs? 




 He had some stormtroopers try to rob a bank for him but they ended up being the gang who couldn't shoot straight. 




 Is he related to Dirty Harry? 




 /r/gonewild

Hasn't affected me in any negative way. 




 Well, maybe she was just testing her thesis :) 




 Yep, I was right :) A conservative. Soooo easy to spot on here. You need a hug. 




 A river full of unicorns and rainbows? Oh...let me guess. You are a conservative aren't you :) 




 Why not look at your own link's title?

Or do you just like to make up things in hopes of getting attention? 




 Wait, what 'facts'? That Obama watch it all happen? That he ordered troops to stand down?

This has been investigated more than 9/11/2001 and the Anthrax mailings combined. And at every turn the RW BS has proven to be...wrong. 




 The press: "Hey, can your HR dept, which has nothing else to do, go grab this personal information from a file and hand it to us? What is taking you so long? Why won't you just give us what we want now?? It has nothing to do with politics. Drop what you are doing and pay attention to us." 




 Romney soon to be 0-2 against black men. 




 Hopefully Holyfield will only use 47% of his power when punching him.

But I can see the right spinning this now "Black man attacks Romney!" and then tying it to Ferguson protests. 




 From the report: "The Islamic Republic of Iran is an ongoing threat to US national interests because of its support to the Asad regime in Syria".

The 'terrorism' section is one page long and isn't broken down by country.

So not sure, overall, what the big deal is. 




 So - what do you want Obama to do? Ignore how the court ruled??

It's settled and the FR has been updated to reflect the facts - some I know cons don't like. Maybe you would like him to say "Hey, I am the king and don't care how the courts ruled on this issue! And let's not update things to reflect reality to please the right."

Ok..whatever floats your outrage boat. 




 It's not about feelings, it's about facts. The court ruled in bush's favor, that changed the nature of foia and this is simply an extension of that. By updating the FR they will probably not avoid headaches but will be ensuring the public has the facts as it relates to those regulations as the court has ruled. It's pretty simple and basic - unless you think Obama should act all king like and ignore the court ruling? 




 So you are against updating the federal register to reflect the reality from the bush court case? Ok....whatever. 




 I support them on this. The court battle started under bush played out that way and all the Obama Admin is doing is updating the Fed. Register to reflect reality.

 




 Sure - as soon as republicans stop being mad about people needing help and maximizing their kitchen with food to survive.

Why is it no one on the right gets upset when companies use the law/resources to their advantage but call people lazy bums when they tap resources to survive? 




 That has to be a tough competition to judge. It's like having a barrel full of idiots swimming in ignorance and trying to decide which one to grab and declare as the best swimmer.

Gotta love republicans. Love spending money on 'defense' but when it comes to things that actually are harming our citizens - from climate to lack of health care, etc, they balk. 




 And he starts off with a Hitler reference.

Fear mongering, it's what the cons are good at. Scare people into spending more on defense, screw up diplomacy, hype terrorism and china/russia, and then start some wars. 

We've had two Iraq wars and one in Afghanistan to make us safer - apparently they didn't do that because we are now less safe than ever. So, let's spend more money!

Reminds me of education. Every election pols tell us it is broken, elect them and they will fix. I am almost 50 and they say the same thing every time. Apparently they all suck because every election they tell us it is still broken. 




 There are some things I don't think Obama is criticized enough for this - this is one of them. Other things though can get downright silly :) 




 Things were better under Clinton, and Obama, than ever under Bush.

Of course some folks like em some wars and tax cuts to pay to for the wars (how tax cuts pay for them is beyond me, apparently if you cut a billion in taxes it makes a trillion using some voodoo magic) 




 Like I have said before, the right can't admit when it is wrong and it just makes up stuff to scare the weak minded.

Obama WILL take all your guns, he will crash the stock market, he will destroy america, open the borders, make it illegal for your kids to do chores (2012), he hates israel and will destroy (in 2008 people claimed he didn't even say the word 'Israel' in the debates), he ignored ebola and it killed us all....

They haven't been correct about anything. But they still keep making up stuff and never, ever, admit they were wrong about other things. 




 Can Rahm beat Jesus? If he does, look for a Mel Gibson film to cover the details. (ok, going back to my corner now) 




 The right was recently all bent about "White Students Not Allowed To Attend Black Lives Matter Event At Illinois High School, Sparks Controversy "

There can be stories every single day about any other race running into issues because of their race and the right just passes them right on by. They don't claim it is wrong, they don't care one wit. The second a white person runs into some bigotry (or a Christian vs a muslim/hindu/etc) the right suddenly 'cares'.

Then they claim "Look, some others do it as well! So why complain when whites do it? Huh? Go on, explain why my being racist is bad but when someone else does it no one pays attention? It happened once, just look at that high school!"

Yeah...no one takes the right serious on race matters anymore.
 




 When you are dealing with the right, just ignore facts and go with 'belief'. "God controls the heavens and weather!"

The people most skeptical of climate change are the people who most believe in sky fairies.

Funny how that works.

 




 Wait, what, really?

Hey, the people behind this (the ambassador) said a lot I agree on when it comes to Iran. 

Look at the evidence. A biased person from a biased source has said something with no proof to back it up. Back it up.

Conservatives are just upset Obama beat them. Twice. So they make up things because everything they have said to date hasn't come to pass. All they have to go on now is hearsay. 

Did Obama, for example, take people's guns away? Nope. But they said he WOULD. Not that he could. That he would. And the right believed that, without any facts, because....well, hell I don't even know why.

Every prediction from the right about Obama has been wrong, but people put them out there as fact because they want to believe.

 




 This is how we should handle elections. 




 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And Obama is gonna take all your guns, make it illegal for kids to do chores, open the borders, make the US a caliphate, ignore ebola while it kills us all, crash the stock market, send gas to 10/gal, etc.

We get it. The right lives in a fantasy land. 




 Off topic - your comment reminds of that scene in "It's a wonderful life" where George Bailey averted a run and had two dollars left and put them in a basket and commented that he hoped they would be fruitful and multiply :) 




 When I take calls from my X about her new hubby and take her out for something to eat and to talk to comfort her. 




 Record heat in Southern CA.

Here is how republicans view the world: "I looked out my window, and it was snowing, so warming is a lie because out my window is he whole world. Git r done!" 




 The AG's job is to enforce the law, it's congress's job to change it. 

And yes, I do remember that. And what has been the result? People getting pissed off and pushing harder for it to be legalized. 

*Princess Leia: The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.* 




 I think the point is - when haven't we handed them money? And I read both articles (the NYT one was better IMHO). We have become so used to the US just tossing around cash to everyone but the poor and needy here no one even blinks anymore unless they can make a political point out of it.

 




 I think I confuse her in my old age with Loretta Lynn a lot.

Overall: Obama nominated her, she won't serve very long, and I don't see that her impact will be all that much given the scope of the job and the short term she will be serving. If congress approves her and Obama is for her than what I think of her isn't relevant at all to anyone. 

I am pro MJ but short of some national legislation making it legal I don't see her views on it impacting much. It's not like cheech or chong were nominated. If her job is to uphold the law as it is written her views on it all won't matter a lot anyway - though she could divert resources. 

What does one expect a person to say when applying for a job "I think your rules suck and I won't endorse them or enforce them"? 




 No, would rather they actually vote - it's kind of the job we pay them to do. Whether or not they confirm is up to them. They questioned her, have the information they need, now do your job.

 




 Her merits aren't what the discussion is about - bringing her nomination to a vote is. They can do it, they just don't want to because they are pouting. 




 Still haven't found anything?

Here's a start:
http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/US-releases-450-million-of-frozen-Iranian-funds-citing-compliance-to-nuclear-deal-349830

You know, honoring deals that were made, etc. You can dig more from there. But I am guessing if Obama didn't release those funds the right would call him a liar, king, etc.

Maybe you could find the actual deal. How it was made, who made it, signed it, etc - that is,  if the issue is something you are actually interested in instead of just an unintelligent attack. 




 *The administration that Biden is part of has instead been releasing $490 million a month to Iran.*

Now, why don't you go and fact check that, as I did some time ago, and see what comes up. Go on. I'll wait a minute. 




 That guy in the background with the hat on and gray shirt looks like Binny from supernatural (and is that lady wearing an orange hooter's shirt?). 

http://31.media.tumblr.com/10e6a2ef0ba94a994884afcc25897cfe/tumblr_mwcda44wqk1qdcaeco2_500.gif

Anyway, open carry doesn't bug me. But since this is from dead bart I will check elsewhere to get the real facts.
 




 I can be understanding here towards cops. They see it as tool to aid them in serving and protecting. I can't blame them for wanting to do their jobs better.

On the other side of the equation is concern about government employees having data that isn't relevant to any particular crime but could be misused many ways. 

Now, given that there are trust issues between citizens and government I can sympathize with the citizens here more than I can with cops (who often have their own trust issues with citizens).

My solution? Set up a framework of standards. From how data is stored to it's retention period. Shorten the normal retention period but allow a longer one - one where after the short term the data is encrypted and requires, essentially, a 'key party' to access it and the signature of a judge. 

After the longer period data is purged and it is certified that data was purged and any data that is used in a criminal case that happens to have not been purged (accident/willfully) will be tainted.

Lastly, make sure there are stiff penalties should these procedures not be followed. Both criminal and civil. 




 Actually, I have no problem with them at all. Or gun ownership. But thanks for playing :) 




 Just buy some damn ear muffs and you won't hear them. Sheesh, why does everything have to be so complicated? 




 Do a little digging. Note a few things, the original source for example. Also note the name of the ambassador and look at the group he belongs to (and what they say about Iran). What you will find is one quick blurb made on a radio show (Mark Levin), never substantiated, verified, looked into, anywhere. 

So some guy, on a nutball radio show, claims secret meetings took place - and the guy making the claim is from PJ Media...Yeah. OK. I put stock in that.... 




 Good thing he didn't have his hands in his pockets, they would have beaten him for having a concealed weapon, or shot him if they thought his thumb was cocked back and ready to go pew pew pew. 




 Not Obama - that has been debunked. But cons will believe anything if you say it about Obama. 




 He went for a walk over to Palin's back porch for a cup of tea. You 'betcha! 




 What whiners. The money would come from restitution funds. And turtle man is just trying to hold the nomination hostage (sort of like the iranians held Americans hostage back in the 70's...hmm, letters to Iran and holding up a bill on human trafficking. Alex jones should put the two together).

If you believe in a bill put it to a vote and quit playing games, and don't make excuses for holding up this AG nomination longer than any in the last 30 years. 




 This investigation has taken longer than than 9/11/2001 and been investigated more that it and Anthrax combined.

And all their fishing trip has done so far is make fools of conservatives who ran about making up all kinds of wild accusations. 




 Conservatives to scientists: "God controls the weather, it's why he sends hurricanes to punish people who are for gay marriage. All we have to do is pray and sweet baby jeebus will save us. Of course, if all you godless libs would read the good book, you would see climate issues are a sign from god and a punishment on you all. Git r done!"

And that, my friends, is the republican position on science. 




 That when they lift the veil they will see Hillary underneath it. And I would pay well to see their faces when that happens :) 




 Did you even read the article? What is it you 'believe' that folks will find? Want me to help you out? I can. 




 LOL...Oh, ok. So the State Dept is 'Challenging' Hillary on this?

Right. Really, does anyone take fox serious anymore when they write such headlines? Oh, don't answer that - we know the right won't look past the headline much. 

*She said the department only started automatically archiving emails for other senior officials in February.* - note, "senior officials" - which isn't even defined by anyone. Google it. There are 9 of them. 

Why didn't fox make note of that? I mean, it is basic fact checking.


 




 No, they aren't. They are looking into a tax exempt group that may have violated conditions of funding. But fox knows the right won't think for themselves so they make up headlines.

Back in 2008 Obama was gonna take all the guns away according to the right. Has that happened or were they just making up shit like now? I'll let the facts answer that :) 




 Republicans will oppose this. The idea of not being able to control a woman and her personal choices upsets them deeply.

What they would like to see is the child born, hungry and homeless and in this case motherless so they can practice their own brand of Christianity and tell the kid he is a lazy bum, worthless, and no way they will support him/her getting foodstamps or a free lunch at school.

That is hard to do when someone is pregnant, so force them to have the kid so you can belittle them later. Oh, and discourage birth control, health care for the baby and pregnant woman (she should work harder if she wants care - what do you think we are, barbarians like in those other countries where people have single payer???)

But don't worry - the republicans are on the way to save the save day and force women to carry their babies to term. Git r done republicans. 




 Well, we changed it up a bit. On the gun thing:

We will announce that all gun owners can get a free bible and ammo when they bring their guns to a jesus station to be blessed by a rabbi. And for each gun they bring in to be cleaned, for free, they get a copy of the quran with Obama's face on the cover to burn (we will have a fire going with free smore's and such).

We will also be offering a free entry for each gun to a raffle. Grand prize is a 50 cal machine gun signed by reagan that was used to kill muslims after 9/11. Many won't be able to resist. And when they show up, Obama will personally take their guns (don't tell them, the place is already surrounded by isis folks to protect him).

Gonna be a hoot! See you there! 




 You give /politics too much credit. At my age I have spent a lot more time doing other things. Like working with conservative/republicans in the 80's/90's, being involved in a lot of religious groups (baptists/lutherans/pentecostals/etc) and a good amount of time studying eschatology and politics in general.

It is the right who insists we are a 'christian country' and that if we ally ourselves with Israel we will get god's blessing. 

You don't have to believe me. That is fine. Spend just a few hours if you like examining the links between religion, israel, republicans, fundies, and the push for war and come to your own conclusions. I offer only my many years of personal experience as evidence because I really don't believe if I gave you a slew of links/info you would care anyway. 




 The republicans won't listen. They want with Iran and they want Iran to pursue a nuke so they can have their war. Their minds are on Israel and the Apocalypse. Their bible, like the quran for fundie muslims, is their guide. Not science, not diplomacy, not common sense.

You can't rationalize with a fundie because their minds are based on beliefs and nothing else. The right prays for jesus to come back and kill everyone who hasn't converted. They believe their meal ticket to paradise is Israel...because 'god'. They don't want 72 virgins, but they do want a wedding feast in heaven.

The most dangerous people in the world are fundies, and we have a government full of them. 




 So... did he listen to the people when they said they wanted Obama? Twice? If so I am sure he has been supportive of his presidency. Cause, you know, he's a voter-listener.

 




 You can't order the Noblesse Oblige anymore - labor costs were too high so they took it off the menu and replaced it with grilled cheese since it has a better profit margin ;) 




 Every single time the min wage comes up people claim it will destroy america and cause businesses to close. We still have a glut of food joints and such places. A big mac costs more now than ever, and they are still selling.

Yet people don't seem to complain when investors want to cut costs and raise prices to get more of a return on their investment. Workers are investors (in time/labor) but when they ask for more return people get all upset. 




 As usual, a blog post with no intelligent thought which appeals to people who can't handle much more than that.

How about they take on things like this:
Why Are GOP Hopefuls Speaking At An Event With An 'Ex-Terrorist' Who Allegedly Threw Jews Off Buildings?

http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/why-are-gop-hopefuls-speaking-event-ex-terrorist-who-allegedly-threw-jews-buildings 




 I heard they were doing that so they have more room for fema trailers when they start operation rushhannity and round up all the republicans and take their guns. Shortly after Obama will declare the US a caliphate and attack Israel to bring on the apocalypse. Hillary will be the camp's commandant. 

Or something like that. 




 Mr Paul? Have a seat over there. 




 She didn't break the rules, all emails to others there are obviously recorded. SO: She could have used both state dept email and her own email for her personal emailing. Which would put us in the same boat now. Except some really want her personal emails. 




 Why, does he need a job or something? Maybe someone wants him to close down the US government and outsource it, seems to be his thing.  




 You mean by not screwing up the US and keeping our soldiers out of stupid wars? I'd rather have another clinton, the worst that could happen is sex and the best is no wars and booming economy. 




 Let me guess. Conservatives, fundies, republicans? Yep.

Well, I suppose when you believe god punishes America because of gay people the whole thing might make sense to you. Thankfully America is getting more diverse, less isis...errr fundie christian like, and more open minded. 

You can't stop progress now anymore that you could in the 60's, but the same people are using the same arguments now. 




 Even the people she sent them to? 




 See also 1:23 in for more specific information and the actual quote around then and it's real context.

http://www.appropriations.senate.gov/webcast/cjs-subcommittee-hearing-fy16-budget-fbi-us-marshals-service-dea-atf 




 Not really. Go to the link. Check the link they give. Watch the actual hearing.

One area of interest is at 1:14. Section relevant to this article is around 50 min in.

Might give people a different view on it all. 




 Spend money to help the poor and needy? Nope. Spend it to investigate hillary and benghazi? Hell yeah! 

If hillary wasn't running they wouldn't care one wit. If she decides not to I will laugh :) 




 I will add to that (but without the god part for now).

Here is what the right believes:

All humans can be wealthy
They can all own businesses

Of course, if that were true there would be no one to actually work.

"Look at me! I own a bank...but there is no one to work here, do IT, cash checks, etc"

Or "I own this large freighter and can pilot it and maintain it myself, and load it!"

Basically, they live in a fantasy world where workers aren't needed and hence have no rights.

Somehow, someway, I think maybe they think god and his angels will just do the actual work because they don't actually believe anyone has to work for anyone else, ever, anywhere. And if they do it is just because they aren't smart enough to own their own company.  




 *On Monday, Republican state lawmakers proposed a constitutional amendment that would block California's publicly funded colleges and universities from banning the American flag*

Ah, smaller government. Of course republicans like the flag. What else would they wave during their wars and drape over the coffins of those they sent to die in them?

How many 'died for our freedom' in Iraq? Cause, last time I checked, Iraq wasn't a threat to our freedom. 

Flags, crosses, bibles, and war. It is like the republicans are constantly trying to sell us a movie trailer. 




 Well, it all depends you see.

If the economy is bad, it's Obama's fault. If it is good - well congress makes the law. If spending is up and debt is up, well, Obama did that with his super magical presidential powers. If it is better, only congress can do that.

So the only thing that really matters is - do you hate the person in office or do you like them? 




 Well, fundies (conservatives), believe that gay marriage will cause god to send hurricanes and such. 

Apparently god doesn't care about cheating, lying, killing, corruption, screwing the poor and sick, etc. That stuff is just fine and dandy. But gays? Whew boy - that will bring punishment.

Fundies are a big part of why I am now an atheist and a liberal leaning person (Independent, but I won't vote for another republican so long as I live). 




 Ahhh, conservatives. They were upset when interracial marriage was allowed but 'traditional marriage' survived. Now that gays can marry they want to tell state employees "If you don't like having to do your job we will help you, because we know how hard it is on you to sign some papers".

Yeah. Ok. Maybe someday they will grow up and join the rest of the 21st century. 




 Well. Election isn't for another, what, 20 months, and she hasn't even announced yet. So...not sure anyone cares :) Heck, does she even have a job right now??

If it comes down to clinton vs bush I will look at the last two in office with that name and compare. Which one did better? 




 Good. I wonder how many hours of her phone calls weren't taped and we will never hear? People get all goofy about email - but phone and private conversations they just shrug off.

Maybe this will trigger a new patriot act if bush wins - where we will require all email, phone, and personal face to face conversations be recorded so everyone can view them.

Finally, the republicans will be happy - but, of course, they will still be investigating benghazi no matter what. 




 A crappy pic, was expecting it be some congressman. 




 Or is a trollportation device? 




 This makes me want to go to church. Do they use holy rollers to paint with? 




 Is there a pic of the poopatrator? 




 Is it a contest when you pay to enter, or gambling? :) 




 So? By the rules she could have a private account for emails. She is under no obligation to share her personal emails anymore than anyone else is required to tape all their phone calls for anyone (or record their personal conversations).

The right is doing all it can to bury good economic news. Obama must have them scared, their hopes for america to fall under his presidency has failed. All they have left are emails and benghazi..... 




 Is there anything they don't blame Obama for? Oh yeah - the economy improving. 




 No, it's just more ranting from some guy whose first name is the last name of his favorite author. 




 Judge made the right choice.

"The judge said if you allow one type of display, then you will have to allow all types." 




 What a whiner. People are still upset Obama beat them twice and there isn't a day that goes by they don't find some reason to try to convince us all that he is evil and America will turn out like it did under bush (wars, death, recession, less freedoms, etc). They have ratcheted up the rhetoric now that there is more good economic news. 




 Man, that fox station did a poor job of reporting. The Beast refers to trains in Mexico and the protest is in mexico and about mexico. The government down there has gotten more involved in the last year with the issue of immigrants going through mexico and chasing them off trains/etc. 

http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/central-american-migrants-and-la-bestia-route-dangers-and-government-responses

 




 I think someone needs a hug and to watch some My Little Pony. 




 Ah, leave it to the daily caller. When it's white people involved they suddenly care about rights. Black folks in ferguson/etc? They basically call then whiners and denied racism ever played a factor in that city in anything. Beat protestors, don't allow them to stand still, etc? Go for it. But a school punishing kids for racism? Why...the horror! 




 Is that anything like summoning a demon? 




 Wait...what? He had a 'watch' where he was supposed to be doing...well, what exactly? 

I love how the right gives Obama super powers. "He will ban all guns!" How? Can he do that? "Uh...no but he will!"

"Poll says race relations deteriorate, Obama to blame! Story up next on Fox."  




 Is the economy better now than 2008? Stocks up. Unemployment down. Profits up. If this were a republican president the right would have bands playing in the street and trumpets blaring all over the place. 

But now they have a sad. They wanted to see America get worse. They made all kinds of terrible predictions about what would happen. All your guns would be taken. Stocks would crash. America would crumble and lose it's freedoms. Etc.

You would think people would be happy we aren't struggling like in 2001-2008, bogged down with 100,000+ troops in wars, economy tanking, etc.

Naw. Some just like to whine. 




 "Hey, I don't like gays so I don't want to do the job I was hired for. That's ok right?"

gop: "Sure thing!" 




 2012:
When U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Scott Gration resigned his position early this morning, he said in an emailed statement, differences with Washington regarding my leadership style and certain priorities lead me to believe that it's now time to leave." 




 LOL. The closest they get is a letting in 1984 by ten dems - and what was it the right was saying about it then?

* ''This letter,'' Mr. Gingrich wrote, ''clearly violates the constitutional separation of powers. It's at best unwise, and at worst illegal.'' Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, who helped draft the letter to Mr. Ortega, calls Representative Gingrich's attack ''frankly ludicrous.'' *

So...I guess they feel the same now?? 




 But...but, Obama is a socialist dictator king and he already banned all the guns, why would he stop now at his moment of glory? It is not like him at all. Fox news must investigate this and explain why their portrayal of him as a dictator was off a bit.... 




 An old story from 2014 with no link to the actual law. Ok.... 




 I remember a lot of things. 30 million spent to investigate lewinsky/clinton. 15 mil for 9/11/2001. Anthrax? Don't recall that terror being investigated by congress. What was the stated goal of the benghazi investigation (it WAS investigated and a report released - and it debunked the right wing bs)?

Now, let's go back to the 9/11 investigation. How do we know everything was released? We don't. You never can. By the rw logic that investigation should still be going on today (at least until we can get the results some want).

 




 They don't want her Benghazi emails (what could they prove anyway??) what they want, and what gowdy is now going for, is ALL of her emails so that they (republicans) can view them and leak anything they can find not related to benghazi to try to embarrass her.

She turned them over and gowdy is now saying he doesn't believe the state dept turned over all of the benghazi ones and doesn't trust them to. So he wants them all to see for himself. So now he is accusing the state department of lying (which I am guessing would be a criminal act - but they aren't launching a criminal probe are they?)

Can any conservatives here tell us what they think they will find? That she caused it, let it happen, stand down orders, etc (all of which have been handled already)?

What they want is dirt ahead of 2016.

They have investigated benghazi more than 9/11/2001....why? 




 AM talk radio. 




 So basically - this was all a ruse to get *all* her emails to the "Bi-partisan" group so they can leak some for 2016. Very slick - looks like clinton made the right play in the long run :) 




 I can hear the conservatives now - just like on gay marriage "Now people can marry animals, their cousins, etc" they will be saying "Now people won't be allowed to do violence against cousins and their own kids! Where will government intrusion end??" 




 A fair question. If I had to guess I would say most who signed up were fellow citizens who needed it and don't let their personal politics make the decision for them. 




 Bush said he would be court painting the proceedings. With puppies he stole from war orphans. 




 I don't know if anybody did or not either. I wasn't reading everyone's emails. Can I get daily caller to write a story about me? 




 Well, from the right has told us - Obama is going to take all your guns, not allow kids to do farm chores, was born in kenya, crash the stock market, ebola would kill us all because of obama, he is a criminal, king, muslim, corrupt - so I am sure that they didn't think this would happen either. But...they have been wrong since 2008 on just about everything. 




 He is, apparently, a criminal. The right is stuck on this one - Obama's justice department is doing this - but the right swears anything Obama does is bad/criminal/etc. So they will find a way not to give him props on this and complain about it, while using it to smear dems in general.

Will be fun to watch :) 




 So, we have people like married couples that the right thinks she be headed by the male and the woman should stay at home - and now that may be the case....but instead of saying that the cons want to use the numbers to show how 'bad' things are. LOL.

"OH we can't give more aid to the poor, makes em lazy and then they won't go get a job!" and then later that day "There are no jobs cause of Obama". They keep trying to pass the buck instead of just admitting they hate the poor and needy and Obama as well and do anything they can to denigrate things and paint themselves as the solution. 




 Wait, wasn't SHE the head of the state dept? So she can make her own rules, that's what being the boss means. She worked hard to get where she was and thems the perks. Conservatives she be backing her here for doing her job like a boss. 




 Well, I don't like her myself :) But when people are more upset over this than things like bush, 9/11, Iraq war, etc and so on it amuses me a bit :) 




 So the head of the state department, who makes rules, didn't follow the rules a different head of state department had in place. Ok. 

*After this story was first published, a State Department official acknowledged the 2005 policy but emphasized that it is limited to records containing such sensitive information.*

So it wasn't a blanket policy. Ok. 




 Prostitution roundup. Sounds like something Monsanto would make for STDs. 




 Hooves up. Don't shoot. 




 So, an illegal immigrant christian eh? I knew it! Thanks Obama. He just lets anyone from the country of Latin in here. 




 Damn that big government anyway! Those guard troops should be in Iraq fighting for our freedoms against....well, I dunno. Saddam or something. Anyway, they should be fighting in wars where all good soldiers belong, and in 2016 when we get a republican back in office we will get back on track in Iran and such and put those troops right where conservatives want them. In war. 




 Is it ISIS or Christianity - sometimes, it is easy to get them confused. They both hope and pray for those who don't believe to die (see Revelation, apocalypse, 2nd coming, etc), they both want their religion to influence laws, and they both spend a lot of time converting others and warning of god's punishments, oh - and both have started wars in the middle east. 




 Not sure why she should. Is she employed somewhere? Did she violate a law that someone can point to? Or do people just like to randomly ask questions and complain when people don't answer them? 




 So rehosted content from gateway pundit and you repost from a link that references the same.

LOL. 




 So, who is this Clinton person? Does she have a job right now or something? Is there some reason we care about things that happened in 2000 or so? If so, I have some 9/11 questions I would like us to look into, and that whole anthrax thing too.

I know I have heard her name somewhere before, but then I have heard ashcroft, cheney, bush, and a lot of other names from back then. Maybe I am missing something.... 




 *"Moving people from welfare to work is what has made this program a success," Ryan said in a statement announcing the legislation.*

But, but, republicans keep telling us there are no jobs to get because of Obama. Hunh. Maybe they are just lying. As usual. 




 What did he say today he couldn't have said at home on the TV?

 




 Ohhhh I get it! So what the right wants Obama to do is break the law, so they can whine again about something.

*President Obamas new deportation amnesty could grant Social Security numbers to as many as 4 million illegal immigrants, making many of them eligible for tax refunds under the Earned Income Tax Credit*

Sooo....it triggers a law already in place and the right is wanting Obama to just stop it or something? Hey, maybe that republican congress can do the job you pay them for and change the law instead of whining that the law is being followed. 




 Oh hey - instead of using an article from 2011 how about you post what they are saying NOW?

https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/fcc-votes-net-neutrality-big-win 




 2011? Reaching there aren't you :) 




 I bet he believes bush called 9/11 a terror attack and that Obama didn't call Benghazi one. Bush called it a 'cowardly attack' that morning.

The guy obviously isn't too smart - which makes him a perfect candidate for the nomination. 




 *Heres the simple truth about our foreign policy. Our allies doubt us and our adversaries are all too willing to test us. No one should be surprised. No one should be surprised that dictators like Assad would cross the Presidents red line because he knows the President wont even defend the line that separates our nation from Mexico.*

Let's just get down to the brass tacks here. Under Obama we have deported more people and defended our border better than bush did. But let's not even bother with that.

What is Perry really trying to say here? That Assad sits around reading immigration reports from the US? Really? Is Perry that stupid? But OK, maybe Assad has nothing better to do.

So now we have Assad reading immigration reports and coming to the conclusion that Obama won't do anything about anything he does. Which is still silly. 

BUT maybe, just maybe.....

Assad sees how the right tries to stop anything Obama wants to do by yelling "He didn't get our approval first!" and realizes that if he does anything Obama won't be able to act because republicans will get in the way because they care more about politics than the country.

If I were Assad I would act more on that than anything else - divide America because you know one party will stand in the way no matter what. 



 




 Sad, but true. It's all a shell game and the right and the left not in power in America just beat each other up while the true enemies walk off with it all. 




 Take a look at the difference between the two. 

*Quantitative easing increases the money supply by flooding financial institutions with capital in an effort to promote increased lending and liquidity.*

Note the difference in broad based tax cuts and targeted items like this. There is a fundamental difference between the two, take your time and examine them both if you need to.

One has a direct purpose and a 'plan' (if you will). The other does not. 

 




 Well, hell. Now conservatives will be against it. 




 I tried to get to it, but it was throttled. 




 Don't tell him that, he might bring in a rocks and drop them on the floor. Oh wait...didn't someone just do that with a snowball? 




 Not when the supply is coming from tax breaks. As we saw with the tax holiday and cut bush pushed.  




 So what you are saying is that trickle down doesn't work? 




 You mean like the gun owner who killed 9 people today in Missouri? Yeah, folks like that worry us all. But the gun owners will rush in and say 'we are not all like that!' and then turn around and say 'a muslim killed someone, they all are to blame'.

Funny how it changes when your own ox is gored. 




 Corporate Profits Are At An All-Time Record Peak And Expected To Grow in 2014
http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlenzner/2013/11/30/there-are-far-fewer-bears-on-the-stock-market-today-than-at-the-peaks-in-2000-or-2007/

We aren't hemorrhaging jobs, wage growth is set by companies, debt is high but we can thank a trillion in spending on wars for part of that and debt isn't always bad.

It just chaps the right wing that the nation didn't collapse like they claimed it would/hoped in 2008. 




 Which party is trying to do that?

*ast month, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich became the first high-profile conservative to champion one of the most extreme environmental positions in recent memory: total elimination of the EPA.*

So, okay, the stock market is up under obama, and was down under bush - great, we agree on that. 

Now, google 2008 obama will crash stock market. You will find such gems as:

Warning: Stocks Will Collapse by 50%

*Faber doesnt hesitate to put the blame squarely on President Obamas big-government policies and the Federal Reserves risky low-rate policies, which, he says, penalize the income earners, the savers who save, your parents  why should your parents be forced to speculate in stocks and in real estate and everything under the sun?

Billion-dollar investor Warren Buffett is rumored to be preparing for a crash as well. The Warren Buffett Indicator, also known as the Total Market Cap to GDP Ratio, is breaching sell-alert status and a collapse may happen at any moment. *

The right wing is a little butt hurt all the bad things they said would happen didn't. Jobs grew, the stock market soared, we didn't all die from ebola, people can still buy guns.

And here they are in 2015 still predicting doom and gloom like some cheap 900 line psychics. 




 You would think fox would be all over it slamming Obama. Hell, I might agree with them for once if they did. 




 Oh look - you just said we are in a recovery, though you claimed it is the worst one ever. I'd rather be in a bad recovery than a good recession/depression like under bush.

TIL learned that even though companies have more profit now than any time in history it was under the weight of restrictions that have kept them from growing, all put into place by Obama and which didn't exist at all under bush's superior plans (which saw...well, nothing good happen). 




 Has no one ever heard of skype? Why does someone need to come here and give a speech to congress? Can't he email it?

Maybe it's just grandstanding and politics. 




 Here, let me help out a bit on this:

Republicans: "Unemployment is high, because of Obama!"

Later that same day: "We won't extend UE benefits because there are plenty of jobs and people getting UE are just too lazy to get jobs"

So there are plenty of jobs according to them, but then there aren't....as usual, they make little sense. 




 More of that smaller government they are always talking about eh? I bet he proposed not helping kids who need food or medical care- but then, once kids are born the right aborts their care about them. 




 First: No conspiracy is being claimed by me about 9/11. But an attack of that magnitude certainly warrants more investigations into it than the 2012 one.

Second: The right is simply milking this to fuel their outrage. Republicans don't even have to have a stand on issues these days because they just rely on people buying into everything about Obama and scaring them into voting.

If you want to destroy faith in the system just look at bush. Stock market less than when he came into office, job loses, housing market, failed wars, etc - and NOW the right us upset and whining? Yeah. A tad selective don't you think? 




 No, I don't recall claiming that. What I am saying is people are making a mountain out of a mole hill because what some people said during an ongoing issue isn't what they desired to hear.

And now they want to punish someone for not running about yelling terrorism because it denied them the ability to use the deaths right away to denigrate an entire religion based on what some conservative faction of that religion's followers did. 




 Correction - they suspected. First off, just because some terrorist group claims something doesn't mean you believe them - they could be looking for street cred. 

Second - even if it was the tape could be a trigger event or the reason a group claimed it did it (look at claims made the folks beheading people, they list causes).

So, play it safe until you can prove otherwise and don't give credit out willy nilly.

Oh, and that group that claimed it did it?

Members of Ansar al-Sharia have regularly taken part in protests in Tunisia against perceived blasphemy and have been suspected in involvement in a number of violent incidents.

So, they claimed they did it, they have a history of violent attacks due to blasphemy.... 




 Yeah, and we don't have all the facts about 9/11 either - but the right sure pushed away those investigations in a hurry. And that whole anthrax thing? Repubs buried the chance for that investigation.

But hey, some groups looking for tax exempt status (including liberal ones) were looked at closely by the IRS before granting them that status and suddenly we have a crisis.... 




 They will probably try to tie them to Benghazi somehow. 

Also, from the article:
*Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Utah Republican and Oversight Committee chairman, said the ongoing investigations undercut President Obamas assertion last year that there was no evidence of corruption in the IRSs targeting.

I have no idea how the president came to such a definitive conclusion without all the facts, he said.*

And ya know, I don't know how the right has come to the conclusions they have either about it all without all the facts, but there they are - republicans running around saying they know what happened. Weird. So maybe all those blabbering on about it should say "We don't really know anything because we don't have all the facts." instead of the gotcha headlines and such about Obama targeting them. 




 Armor piercing ammunition

18 U.S.C.,  921(a)(17)(B)


    A projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium; or

     
    A full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile.


The term armor piercing ammunition does not include shotgun shot required by Federal or State environmental or game regulations for hunting purposes, a frangible projectile designed for target shooting, a projectile which the Attorney General finds is primarily intended to be used for sporting purposes, or any other projectile or projectile core which the Attorney General finds is intended to be used for industrial purposes, including a charge used in an oil and gas well perforating device.


----

The ATF isn't extending, it is interpreting based on existing law what fits into the law. Your link has a link in it to the PDF of the technical reasons laid out as to why they are suggesting the change and I am guessing they are required to allot time for the public to comment on it - so letting the comment period last '5 minutes' would have been a wrong move for them.

Further, in the PDF, you will note that they have been getting a lot more requests, since 2011, for exemptions to the rule - hence their desire to clarify the rule and make it more simple in it's application. Again - this is a proposal which is open for comment on their ideals. 

This reminds me of when there was proposal about kids doing some work on farms and there was a proposal period open for discussion on restricting certain things. The right waited till the comment period was about up and then railed on it claiming Obama was going to forbid kids from helping out on the farm. 

[Barack Obama proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores, John Thune said](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/29/john-thune/barack-obama-proposed-banning-farm-kids-doing-basi/) 




 Let me help you here: "sounds like it came from" and "because the facts aren't what they claim." go together in a sense. When someone wants to detract from the facts (because they aren't as bad/motivated for x reason) they use a headline to plant a suggestion. 

In this case, in the article it is noted: "The proposal by the A.T.F. to reclassify the rifle ammunition started more than three years ago" and it is also noted: "This is an A.T.F. proposal being considered through its standard process, an official there said. "

The attempt by the right the last few days has been to associate Obama himself with this to prop up their failed propaganda in 2008 that Obama would ban all guns. So.....any chance they get they make sure "Obama" appears in the headline.

They also don't mention the 1986 law reagan signed and how this is somewhat of an extension of the definitions listed there to keep the law updated and relevant based on it's stated goals.

Overall - some poor journalism and a story being used by the right to whip up their base. I would have more respect if it was simply written as "Here is an ATF proposal, this is comment period, here is the history of it all, if you oppose it let them know" 




 LOL at your title. "PO's Administration" vs the actual title or saying 'The ATF' for example. It's cute - sounds like it came from a not too bright right wing source that has to manipulate emotions because the facts aren't what they claim. 




 And idiot conservatives actually believe that. Which is sad. 




 They use public paid for/subsidized infrastructure so they have to play by some rules. Do you remember the whole debacle re: fiber cabling and how we got screwed on that deal? Time for them to stop milking us and do what they are supposed to - provide internet. We lag behind other countries because companies can't be trusted. And again - we subsidize their efforts and it isn't irrational to apply some rules. 




 So they used the internet to complain? 




 It's reddit. It's politics. 




 How can this be? I thought Obama was a mulsim and was protecting terrorists? Something doesn't add up!! 




 A bush appointee, no shocker there ;) 




 Well, how do we know if they don't ask the questions? I mean - if he grew up with Islam as his religion do you think they would ask if his religion played a part? Maybe he grew up Christian, shouldn't they look at his bible and see what parts he highlighted? 




 So - some white, probably Christian, male killed someone and was found guilty. Wonder if conservatives will mention his race or religion? 




 Sounds like a true genius of science right there. Must be a conservative. And why wash it out? Just pray it away - I mean prayer is what the republicans want to replace the aca with anyway. 




 I would sit on them too - the republican bills usually read like: "We will allocate funds for highways to create jobs. Also, Obama has to admit he is responsible for Benghazi and food stamps are to be cut 75% to fund a tax break for banks" 




 So, the repubs, knowing he would veto, spent the time and energy anyway on this - yet failed, for years, to push through spending on bridges/roads/etc (at least a clean version of such).

Well, back to Benghazi hearings for them - might as well waste more time and money. It is what they seem to do best. 




 She can attack me anytime. We'll see if she can wield my hammer. Git r done! (yes, somewhat sarcastic there folks and satiric). 




 "Imported"? Did the admin buy them online? 




 BRB have to get my Rainbow Brite doll out of the closet. 




 The criteria is whether you could perform the job if you had it, not whether or not you have a job. Your "past relevant work" is defined as any work you performed on a substantial basis during the past 15 years. The Analyst will assess your Residual Functional Capacity (RFC), which indicates what functions you are able to perform despite your disability. You will be classified as to whether you are capable of doing sedentary, light, medium, heavy, or very heavy work. Your RFC will then be compared to the requirements of your past jobs. This is why it is very important to list all of the physical and mental requirements of jobs on your Work History that you are no longer able to perform. 

https://sp-foundation.org/social-security-disability-insurance-ssdi-and-supplemental-security-income-ssi/#disabled-def

It can play a factor. I think what many don't understand is the complexity of the term 'disability' and how it plays out.  




 *To meet our definition of disability, you must not be able to engage in any substantial gainful activity (SGA) because of a medically-determinable physical or mental impairment(s):*

Low earnings, however, don't necessarily establish that you're unable to work. The SSA will consider the circumstances under which work was performed. For example, where a disability applicant had worked as a substitute bus driver, the court found that he was doing SGA because his low earnings did not indicate that he was unable to work and his income was less than it could be because of the on-call nature of the job. The SSA can even consider volunteer activities and criminal activities as SGA if they represent substantial work for which someone would ordiniarily be paid (the agency will not consider hobbies or school attendance to be SGA).

Similarly, high earnings don't necessarily the claimant was doing SGA, if he or she was working under special conditions. Claimants can argue that their income would have been lower but for the fact that the claimant:

http://www.disabilitysecrets.com/sga.html
--------------

People often picture disabled people are being unable to do much of anything, then see them cutting the grass and yell AHA! Cheater! You are doing work! Without understanding the legal definitions of disability. A mental illness is another example. Your meds can have terrible side effects that leave you in bed most of the day for days, then you are a little better and can do more - but you lack consistency to gain employment (again, people won't see you laying in bed sick in your house,but step outside to shovel your walk and they will think you can hold down a full time job). 




 With republicans in charge you can expect that money will be shifted to corporations that want it or weapons. 

The problems with the fund have known about for last two decades and congress has been too lazy to fix it - the right will claim the problem is from lazy moochers/etc and not congress screwing around. And it will play with their base who don't understand what ssdi actually is (ever hear one say "I know someone on ssdi, he can work!"? They always fail to understand how the term disability is applied and you ability to do what you were doing, etc).

So yes - be worried, the vets will cry out and soften the blow because the right loves soldiers wounded in wars they lied them into, but they will use this time to try to force cut backs. 




 Well, the right is always whining about how they want the government to be run like a corporation. So guessing they support this fully. 




 So just like regular police who have similar choices. How many cops don't arrest people who have been drinking and driving? More than cops who arrest everyone who drinks and drive. Fox news, it isn't for the bright people of the world. 




 I think the "no weapons" part is aimed at them not finding things like camel pox/etc that they claimed were there. I don't see any weapons in the article that were a threat to the US. But hey, we can say we went to war over 400 rockets and some of them from the 80's had sarin - and it stills sound like shit. 




 Do you go fishing there? What kind of motor you use on your boat, a trolling motor? 




 From earlier:

North Carolina man charged in shooting death of three people

Police charged a North Carolina man with three counts of first-degree murder in the shooting deaths of three people outside the University of North Carolina.

Carl Stephen Hicks, 46, is accused of killing two Chapel Hill, N.C. residents Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, and his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Rzan Mohammad Abu-Salha, a Raleigh, N.C. resident, the Chapel Hill Police Department said in a statement.

Both Barakat and Mohammad were students at the University of North Carolina. Mohammad Abu-Salha was studying at North Carolina State University.  




 Nice, about time - twitter folks were hammering on it :) 




 New website (registered last month), new twitter, FB - and a story written to sucker in conservatives by someone named lana whom the editor now claims has been hired to write for them.  Yeah....right. It has been all over right wing sites - mission accomplished. 




 Interesting, fox has it now as well, no mention of 'muslim' (*puts on shocked face*)

http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/02/11/north-carolina-man-charged-in-shooting-death-three-people/ 




 [America, fuck yeah.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R5A0pg4oN8)
 




 Sooo. The rw'ers believe there was some discrimination going on in this case by some dude with a gun because the perp was muslim but fight tooth and nail here in the US whenever someone says a crime was a hate crime ("Crimes are all hate crimes", "you only see hate involved in that killing because the victim was gay in a gay friendly store", etc). Suck it up buttercups. 




 The website was set up last month, same with twitter/fb account, they have now 'hired' the 'author' who wrote that. Yeah....I smell BS and they trolled the right and got lots of web traffic. They knew conservatives would just believe it. Well played webmaster. 




 Good. I know conservatives won't like it - they think you should just accept any action by someone in government and have no means to speak out if things go wrong. But people in the real world like the idea of the government having a place where people can inquire about issues they encounter with government agencies. Maybe if Bush gets elected he will please conservatives and insist that no complaints be communicated and you just take it. 




 Naw, I think the point is that if rw'ers here want to blame all of islam for what some who follow it do they should be consistent and see the mote/log in their own eye and blame all christians for what some christians here did. That they aren't is rather telling. 




 Weird, don't all military people hate libs because they are all cons?

What's your next trick, telling people marines are for taking pics up little girls' skirts? 




 Naked Amish dudes swimming in the sea of Galilee....there's a pic you can't get out of your head. 




 why are you spamming that link to every thread on the issue? 




 The same people whining about this probably were recently telling people "American Sniper" is just a movie, deal with it. 




 Would you like them to add some unicorns and little ponies to the story for you?
