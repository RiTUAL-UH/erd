 Okay, look, if you are suffering from depression and you used to cut I feel for you. Depression sucks, I know it. But there is absolutely no reason for you to bash other people who are suffering by calling them slurs used against women and queer people. That is not acceptable behavior. I don't care if you don't like other people "whining" about their problems, but you have issues and hate speech is not going to help you out any. 




 A lot of bisexual people I know don't like men and women completely equally or in the same way. Some of them are bisexual but only homoromantic or heteroromantic (emotionally attracted to those of the same sex/gender or opposite sex/gender). This is not uncommon at all, and totally normal and okay.

As to whether or not you should come out, that's up to you. Everybody has to make their own decision about whether or not they want to come out and who they should come out to. If you're afraid of coming out because people won't believe you or you don't think your identity is "legitimate" don't worry about that. But if you have reservations for other reasons, I can't really help you there. Just do what you think will work best for your.

As far as counselors and therapists, you should do some research online and see if you can find any in your local area that are LGBTQ-friendly. Not all therapists have the best views, but the ones who are friendly usually advertise it. You could also potentially ask around if you know anyone else that sees a good one - word of mouth is usually a pretty good indicator. Whenever you talk to them about it, just talk. They're there to listen - it's their job.

Hopefully all goes well, I wish you all the best! 




 Well, it would be somewhat concerning for me. If you don't have any friends, that's somewhat of a red flag. Are you too busy for friendships? If so, how do I know you'll have time for a romantic relationship? Or perhaps your personality isn't that great, so people don't really want to be your friend. Or maybe you just don't like people, in which case I would wonder what sorts of things we can do together that don't involve lots of other people. Or maybe you just moved into town and haven't met a lot of people yet.

If we were in a relationship, I would expect you to hang out with my friends on occasion. If you don't like people, that would be a problem for you, and if people don't like you, that would be a problem for everyone else. It could potentially put a lot of strain on our relationship.

That said, I'm sure I could potentially make it work with someone in this sort of situation. However, it would be a cause for concern. This sort of thing really depends on why it is exactly that you don't have any other friends. But keeping up with conversation/not being clingy definitely helps. 




 Wow! You're looking great! Keep being fabulous :D 




 I got a very similar feeling, although I don't smoke and it would be tequila instead of scotch. 




 One of the more common conditions was actually syphilis. In the late 18th century syphilis patients made up about 20% of those in asylums. By 1818, the Royal Asylum for the Insane at Charenton recorded that up to one third of their male patients had GPI, or general paresis of the insane - the underlying cause of which was syphilis. The numbers of syphilitic patients increased greatly throughout Europe in the last few decades of the 19th century. (Source: Syphilis, sex and psychiatry, 
17891925: Part 1 by Robert M Kaplan)

Symptoms included and abnormal gait, blindness, confusion, dementia, depression, headache, incontinence, inability to walk, irritability, numbness in the extremities, poor concentration, seizures, stiff neck, tremors, visual disturbances, and weakness, according to the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/neurosyphilis/). Of course, this disease was no longer an issue after the advent of penicillin during WWII, as syphilis is a bacterial disease and antibiotics made it easily treatable, so it rarely gets to the later stages that doctors used to see in psychiatric patients.

I can't tell you that much about other conditions as (unfortunately) they don't teach a lot of the history of psychiatry whenever you're an undergrad, but what I do know I mostly remember from reading things here or there in my spare time, so I'm not really comfortable discussing other stuff I don't know as much about. 




 I was doing okay until the person draining the abscess started digging their finger around in it. That's when I noped out. 




 That sounds like a really awesome project. I hope they get all the funding they need. :D 




 I'm so glad that I don't have any more school obligations until next semester. I turned in my last paper today.

I'm glad that I live with two incredibly wonderful people who have been really supportive of me throughout this very hectic year.

I'm also thankful that my mom, who divorced my abusive stepdad a few years back, just recently got married again to a really great guy and my sister now has another awesome parent she can look up to as she gets older.

Finally, I'm really thankful that I decided to join a group therapy session for LGBTQ people, everyone in my group was really great and they all made me feel a lot more confident of myself and forgiving of my flaws. They were super inspiring people and I will miss all of them. 




 Well when I came out to my dad I didn't get the best response. To most of the other people I know I merely posted a link to the Huff Post series on asexuality with the comment that anyone who was interested could read more about my identity. It did get a few responses, mostly from friends who were curious, and also one friend who told me that she was ace too! That was kind of neat.

I think that this approach certainly helped. Have information ready. Coming out as gay is different, because at least when you tell someone "I'm gay" they know what that means - you like people of the same sex/gender. But most people have never even heard of asexuality, while even those that have don't usually understand it that well. Plus, if you come prepared with research or articles or FAQs or whatever it shows that you've really put thought into this and your identity isn't just low self-esteem or a phase you'll get over or something equally stupid. Asexuality is a thing that exists, and it is a definitely a part of who you are.

Hope that helps, and good luck! 




 That he was the weird guy with the long hair and all the calendars.

Fyi: I knew my SO through mutual friends in high school before we started dating. Back then he had hair almost to his shoulder blades. Also, he kept a calendar print-out each month with all sorts of random pseudo-holidays on it - talk like a pirate day, pi day, etc. 




 Like, 95% of the time. I dunno if it's just because the shelf we keep our condoms on is on my side of the bed, or if it's merely habit, but my SO almost never puts on his own condom. 




 Nope, not overreacting at all. If a guy did that to me I'd be pissed. This dude sounds like a class-A douche. Slut-shaming, anti-abortion, yet he thinks it's totally okay to have sex with you while not using protection, cum inside you anyway knowing that you're not using any form of birth control, and laughs at you for being upset? I don't know why you were every with this guy in the first place, to be honest.

I would seriously advise you to cut this guy out of your life. Clearly he doesn't respect your body, your consent, or women in general. NOT boyfriend material, at least imho. 




 That's the cost for an electronic transfer to any account that's outside their system. You can get checks but they highly discourage you from doing this and I have no idea how they work. 




 That's exactly the kind of account I was talking about. But our university automatically disperses your financial aid to these accounts. I'm not sure if there's an option to get it sent to a private bank account instead. 




 That's tough. It's really hard for people to come out to others, especially when they're that young, and then have those few people completely phase out of their lives. It sucks, because you feel like you lose the only support you had.

I would definitely suggest you talk to your friend. Just call him up or send him a text asking what's up, and if there was some particular reason you haven't been hanging out as much lately. It's possible he's just been really busy lately.

If that isn't the case and he's actually uncomfortable with you being gay, you'll be able to address that as well, although it might be a lot more complicated. Hopefully it goes well, though.

Good luck! 




 I think the 80-90% communication thing is definitely true. OP and OP's boyfriend really just need to sort out the communication issue, and then the rest will be rather manageable. 




 Feasibly? No. It is possible, but the ATMs on those accounts limit us to a rather low withdrawal amount per day. So we would have to make several bank trips across multiple days to transfer all the money. It's super annoying. So we're all basically forced to use the accounts the university gives us unless we want to spend a whole lot of time withdrawing and depositing cash, or paying a $25 transaction fee if we want to send the money to another bank account. 




 I graduated high school in 2010, so still fairly recently. 




 If you're going to combine finances, you need to actually combine them.

This might not actually be possible for the OP. I'm actually in a similar boat, where I'm living with my partner and another roommate and we all depend on financial aid. My SO has a full scholarship that pays for residence and meal plans, while I only have partial scholarships and grants that cover my tuition while I have to take out loans to pay for everything else.

Although it might not be the same situation for OP, my university automatically disperses financial aid funds to special accounts set up individually for each student. It is also nigh-impossible to transfer this money to other accounts, as it's much more headache than it's worth with the processing times and fees accrued. So we don't really have a choice - all of us are automatically working from separate accounts. The only way we can budget properly is by communicating to each other how much we are spending. 




 No, it's totally reasonable for you to be upset about this. Mishandling money that should have gone toward rent could have ended with you being evicted if you hadn't had someone willing to give you money to make up the rest. And speaking as someone who also has to live frugally off of residual funds from school, I know how every dollar counts. Being flat broke at the end of the semester is a common occurance for me.

You should tell your bf that financial decisions (especially when they effect both of you) should be made together. The fact that he went and made decisions without you shows that he doesn't trust you fully. He should be less worried about you getting mad at him (like it seems he was, leading him to not tell you about your money problems) and more upfront about what's going on. Otherwise, how can you help when things like this happen?

Also, what if for whatever reason an unexpected expense came up and you were even more strapped for cash than you are now? What if your car broke down or one of you ended up sick or in the E.R. and had medical bills to pay? You both need to be aware of how much money you have so that you can respond appropriately in these sorts of situations. 




 I know mine all did. And due to budget issues, a lot of them were incredibly old ... and incredibly racist, just like *Lies* talks about. 




 I would say that you should do whatever makes you happy. If you want to date someone, do it. If not, don't. You shouldn't have to because you feel like someone your age "should be" doing anything.

As far as not being out to everyone, though, I think you shouldn't worry about that either. Not a whole lot of GSRM people are out to every single person in their life. Sometimes that just isn't practical, or it would put them in danger. So no, you shouldn't have to be out to everyone in order to try to find a partner.

Of course, if you do end up finding someone and dating long-term, it will be harder to keep in the closet as that person becomes a bigger and bigger part of your life. However, at that point it will be up to you and your partner to decide if/when you should reveal your relationship to other people. 




 I'm asexual, so this basically describes all my relationships. I'm not attracted to people physically, I'm with them because I enjoy their company. 




 No, I'd say you're correct. Of course you choose whether or not to ask someone else out on a date, or to have relationships with certain people. However, you cannot control who you have feelings for. It's just a part of who we are.

I've actually used food analogies several times to help explain sexuality to people. For instance, some people might really like ice cream or cake but they're on a diet so they can't eat sweets (celibacy). Some people really like certain foods, but over time get sick of eating them a lot so they start eating other things. Or perhaps they might not think they like a certain kind of food but after trying it they realize it's not so bad (sexual preferences sometimes change). Other people are convinced they won't like a food, try it, and end up hating it (sometimes they don't change). And some people really crave things like spicy food, while other people have almost no tolerance; some people only want to eat spicy food occasionally while others will eat particular spicy dishes they're used to but not all spicy foods (asexuality/gray-a/demi spectrum). 




 I have problems recognizing when someone likes me sometimes too. I'll be going along, minding my own business, thinking I'm just good friends with somebody, and suddenly out of nowhere they confess their love to me. This has happened to me like three times. And then I look back and go, "wait, so those times they were saying this or that they were actually flirting..."

It's a bit annoying. 




 Wow, what a difference! Congratulations, I hope you continue to be happy and healthy! 




 Yeah I went for generic descriptor here, but on /r/outhere it's Oh So Squishy, which has gotten a few fans apparently 




 That is an awesome story. Also I love your flair, btw. 




 I think a card saying something like "your bravery is an inspiration" or "I hope your transition goes well and that you have a happy future" would be really sweet to get, especially from someone who they might not know that well. I bet it would make her pretty happy, and who knows, maybe you'll end up being friends? 




 I would love to see a Misty with full sleeves. Just sayin'. 




 That sounds like asexual to me. You should probably look around on the AVEN website or wiki (links in the sidebar) and read up on some things. Then just explore and see what works for you. 




 To be fair though, Tom Bombadil was a pretty unnecessary character, at least in the first book. I'm really glad he got cut out from the trilogy movies, tbh. 




 I too was disappointed by a distinct lack of Strong Belwas. 




 Now that I think about it, book and TV Littlefinger are pretty different. In the books everyone is constantly writing him off as not that big a deal. He's really useful, but no one really seems to understand the extent to which he is manipulating others or how far he is willing to go to get what he wants.

Meanwhile in the show, everyone seems to be relatively well aware that Littlefinger is a backstabbing asshole but he's still really necessary so they can't get rid of him. 




 I know what you're going through. This sort of thing is really rough. It feels terrible whenever the person that you've committed to and want to build a relationship with turns out to not be trustworthy. Whenever I found out, I felt hurt, and betrayed. But I also felt shitty because it felt like I wasn't *good enough*. Or that I was an idiot and should have seen it coming. That sort of reaction is perfectly normal.

You really shouldn't worry about what your friends and family think. It will probably suck for a little while whenever someone asks you about how your SO is doing and you have to tell them you aren't together anymore. But I'm sure most of them will be supportive, and try to be there for you rather than make fun of you or anything.

You aren't naive or silly for liking him. You can't really control your feelings for other people or pick who you fall in love with. And everyone falls in love with someone at some point who turns out to be less spectacular than what they thought. You shouldn't feel guilty or insecure for being a human being who has human emotions and makes human mistakes. Don't beat yourself up about it. You didn't do anything wrong, he did.

Honestly, I know that hearing the "you'll get over it line" sucks but it is somewhat true. In time, your feelings will start to fade a little bit. I think now would probably be a good time for you to do some introspection. Focus on the things you like about yourself and what you want from life. Reflect on what you'll do differently in the future. That sort of thing. Just take time to sort through your emotions and thoughts. The trip you mentioned might be a good time for that.

If you need anything please let me know! We're all here for you. :

Also, it just so happens that my first name starts with an "M" and I would love a tie clip ~~ 




 Sounds like you're asexual to me. You can still get checked out by a doctor if you want, but there is nothing inherently wrong with not being attracted to other people or desiring sex. So don't stress too much. : 




 Speaking as someone who has depression, it sounds to me like you're depressed. I would suggest going to see a therapist. They might be able to suggest therapy or medication that could help you start to feel better. I know it helped me a little.

That said, I know what you're going through is rough. It can be so difficult to find the energy to just keep existing. But you just have to do it. Because eventually, things might get better. I really hope things do get better for you. But in the mean time, we're all here for you. 




 As far as your sexuality goes, to me it sounds like you're somewhere between demi and gray (both?). That's not really anything to stress out about, though. And honestly, you shouldn't have to feel guilty about not wanting sex. You're different from most people, but that's okay, and as long as your partner is happy and love you there shouldn't be a problem.

However, the painful sex is definitely an issue. Sex should never be painful (unless it's intentional because you're kinky like that). I would suggest talking to a gyno about that. 




 Of course it is. I still plan on getting married. Although if I do have kids, I'll adopt. 




 Well if that's your only regret in transitioning, I'd say you're doing pretty okay. ; 




 Daaaaaaaaaaaaamn. 




 Yes, because I consider the community to be more than just strictly for lesbians, gay people, bisexual people, or transgender people. The acronym isn't really that inclusive, but is usually shorthand for the community of all people who aren't strictly heterosexual and cisgender. Some people are now using GSRM, which is more inclusive of those who fall outside the traditional four categories.

I have, however, gotten some resistance from other members, especially cisgender gay people. Of course, these are the same sort of people who usually say that bisexuality isn't a thing and that trans* people don't belong either, so I don't really listen to them. 




 I actually had to read some of Jared Diamond's work and watch a documentary featuring him and his ideas for an intro anthropology course. I remember sitting there the whole time thinking, "this is stupid. This guy is racist, he has quite possibly the biggest white savior complex I've ever seen, and his theory is so simplistic." I'm glad I'm not the only one who recognized that this guy has some problems. 




 Thanks for the help. I will report them for sure if they try to send me anything.

Thank you for your apology, although from what I've seen this person is in a very tiny minority of users in /r/asoiaf. Nearly everyone else has been really welcoming and awesome, so I won't let them scare me off! 




 Seriously, I don't understand you. All I wanted to do was talk about something I like with other people who like it too. Instead, I get an outcry about why I don't belong here because I haven't finished the books *even though the rules of the subreddit state this is perfectly okay.* When people try to tell me that I might get spoiled I respond by saying it shouldn't be an issue as long as everyone follows the rules, and that I'll take my chances because I came here to have fun and participate in discussion.

So instead of letting it go, you insist that I'm a dick for wanting to be here and now you're going to do the EXACT THING that you and everyone else has been warning me about? Self-fulfilling prophecy much? But apparently I'm still the dick. Whatever dude, seems like you're the one with the problem here, not me - I've had plenty of good discussion and pleasant exchanges with other people on this thread and in this sub in general. Right now you're the only one who is acting like a stubborn dick, really. 




 Well, I thought I was being pretty reasonable. Just asking people to follow the rules and not worry about me doesn't qualify as being a dick, at least in my opinion. And telling me to get out is not helping me, fyi.

Also, I find it hard to believe that you perceiving my tone as hostile is proof of me being a dick while you and other people constantly telling me to get out isn't being a dick. 




 Of course it would get rid of the "you shouldn't be here" argument, hypothetically, but I don't know if it would make the situation any less threatening for trans* folks, since they would then potentially have to contend with two groups of cis people who might not want them there instead of just one. Sharing bathrooms won't take away the prejudices that a lot of people have, at least not right away. So it might get better in the long run, but I imagine it might get worse in the short term.

It would be really great though if this sort of thing were no longer an issue. 




 Ok, I laughed. ngl 




 It depends on the person, I think. 




 I don't normally post pics online, but what the hey.

https://scontent-a-iad.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/969507_10151240118682255_928045531_n.jpg

I'm on the left, with my SO on the right. 




 Honestly, I feel like people don't give kids enough credit. The whole "how do we explain it to the children?" argument is used a lot when discussing sexuality or gender identity or any of that stuff. Adults tend to assume that explaining that someone is any form of LGBTQ will confuse children, or even potentially harm them. But in reality, children are often far more understanding about that sort of thing. You explain to them that Uncle Bob is gay because he loves other guys and they usually say something like "okay. Let's go play now." They really don't care.

I would say the same thing applies to polyamory. "Sometimes Mommy and Daddy like to have other partners." "Oh, okay. Can I watch Spongebob?" Really not that hard. And if they have questions, just answer them the best you can and don't act ashamed about it. 




 Honestly, no, I wouldn't be that comfortable, because we live in a terrible world where violence against women is an unfortunate reality. Also, a lot of trans* people have bathroom issues, and I'm not sure lumping everyone together in one big one would help matters much.

Theoretically, though, if we lived in a society where none of the above was an issue, I wouldn't really mind. Of course, I would agree with the other comments though about having proper stalls. No huge gaps underneath the doors or walls, and no cracks in the doors that let you see people. Those are terrible enough in our current bathrooms, ugh. 




 Your parents were definitely abusing you, and sounds like they are either in denial or are trying to [gaslight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting) you about it. That is not okay. None of the things you described are in any way okay.

I am so glad to hear that you are going to get away from them soon. Please take care of yourself. Also, I don't know how the laws work where you live, but I know that in the U.S. where I am if someone files a missing person's report on you and you are an adult they can't force you to come back if the authorities find you. In fact, this is often used as justification to abandon a case if there isn't any evidence of foul play. So I wouldn't worry about that too much. 




 Arousal and attraction are not the same, although they can overlap. While it is possible that you are demi, the fact that you experience physical arousal doesn't necessarily mean you aren't asexual either. Honestly, female bodies are prone to lubrication even if they definitely don't want sex (even during sexual assault), so it's pretty safe to say that if physiological response isn't always linked to a willingness to have sex or an attraction to someone.

Not all asexual people have no sex drive. Ultimately the decision is up to you, but identifying as asexual doesn't mean you can't want to or enjoy having sex with your partner. It just means you aren't physically attracted to people. 




 Like previous commenters have said, follow through is really important. It takes time but you have to walk the walk. Don't just try to tell her that she can trust you, but SHOW her you are trustworthy, again and again. Eventually this will help her feel safer with you.

Also, it would certainly help if you just ask her if you can help and how. Not only will it give you some actually effective ideas, but it will demonstrate to her that you care about her needs and feelings.

And don't be afraid to mess up sometimes. Not everyone is perfect. But if you make a conscious and willing effort to fix your mistakes, that says a lot about your character and the lengths you will go to in order to have a healthy relationship with this girl. 




 I really don't get along well with women who thrive on drama. I am very much anti-drama, so women who are really gossipy or in any way double-faced really don't work for me. But then, the same goes for people in general, not just women. 




 When I first started dating my SO we were monogamous, and we tried to open up and it worked out terribly the first time. The main issues we had were a lack of communication, as well as the fact that I really wasn't ready for it at the time, and then the other person he was dating (and one of her other partners I had contact with) all treated me like some afterthought. All in all it was just not a very good situation. Our relationship was seriously rocky for a while. But eventually he stopped seeing the other partner, we worked everything out, and for a while we went back to being mono.

It's been nearly two years since then, and we're in a much healthier place now. A few months ago, I brought up the idea of having an open relationship with my SO. This time around we were both frank about our feelings, and what we wanted. He still had the desire to date other people, and I had developed a crush on someone else as well. So now we're open again. This time things have worked out much better because we're more open and honest with each other, and we approached the situation with mutual respect. Now he is freely looking for other partners, I can freely pursue my crush, but our relationship with each other is even stronger. We're a lot happier now.

So I would say that yes, going from closed to open can certainly work, but it can also go wrong if you go about it the wrong way. You need to maintain open communication, respect for everyone involved, honesty, and adherence to whatever boundaries all of you decide upon. 




 "I'm not racist, but..." 




 Smart kid. xD 




 If you ever find yourself saying the words "but I didn't mean it to be offensive," odds are you really need to re-examine what you're saying. 




 This might also be good for /r/pettyrevenge - that is some petty revenge if I ever saw it. 




 I'm suddenly really glad that I'm allergic to rabbit and have therefore never bought angora yarn. 




 That's the sort of thing I was talking about! Of course OP might not have had their wrist broken so maybe they don't need as long of a break. They can probably experiment and see what works for them. Still, though, the idea is that you need to avoid constant strain, so short breaks and stretches are probably a really good idea. 




 No, sorry - I haven't used one. 




 Making my own patterns for items that are fitted. Right now I'm working on a long-sleeved shirt and tunic for a Link cosplay. It will be quite the adventure. 




 Fantastic! I'm jelly. : 




 So jealous. I need a ball winder really bad :/

I've got one on my Christmas wish list, though, so hopefully I might get one too :D 




 I've done a little of my own pattern work, as well as freehanding. The one thing to keep in mind, I think, is to be aware that YOU WILL MAKE MISTAKES. This is inevitable, and part of the learning process. Even if you've made dozens of your own patterns before you will still make things that end up looking wonky sometimes. So don't be afraid to frog it and try again!

Something that might help would be to take existing patterns that are a bit simpler and making alterations to them. It will help you understand how shapes work, and how you can manipulate them. 




 I've had problems with my wrist getting my sore and my hand cramping up while trying to crochet too fast for too long.

A wrist brace will probably help, and also try to take regular breaks. Like, crochet for 50 min. of an hour, and take a break for the last 10 minutes or something. That way you aren't getting a constant strain. 




 That's adorable! I've actually been thinking about making a cowl to look like the Traveler. I bought the yarn and everything, just haven't started yet. I'll be making my own pattern so I've been procrastinating because it will involve a lot of swatching and I hate swatching. 




 Well usually when people ask me to make stuff for them I just start explaining all the work that goes into it. They'll ask me for a Dr. Who scarf and I'll say, well I need 7 colors of yarn at approximately $5 or so a skein, plus a set of straight needles which will be around $10 or so, so you've already spent about $45. Now it will take me at least a month to make it since I'll be working on it in my spare time between classes and other projects. So if you paid me per hour at minimum wage that scarf would be hundreds of dollars. Sound good?

Of course I never actually charge an hourly rate, just enough to make it worth my time and get a little profit. Perhaps the best way to show people how much time, effort, and money this sort of thing takes is to just hang out with them while you make something. You can physically show them how much work you can get done within the few hours you're together. Then you can estimate how much longer it would take to finish the entire project. Usually when people see me working on something and I tell them how long I've already been at it they gain a lot more respect for what I do. 




 I'm making this a text post because I don't really need karma for this, I just wanted to gush a little bit.

Recently I had an artist's table at a local convention. It was only the second time I've done this and the first time I had to do it by myself. Also, nearly all of the stuff I made this time around was from my own patterns and designs, rather than using other people's patterns (with permission, of course) like I did last time.

This is kind of a big deal for me, as I've had a lot of trouble trying to get a "real job" while also being in school and dealing with anxiety and depression issues. However, starting my tiny crafting business has really helped me, not only because I got to destress while making things (isn't knitting so relaxing?) but also because it's given me a lot of self confidence. So many people came by my booth. Some of them bought my stuff, but even those who didn't had a lot of compliments about how cute all my stuff was or how impressed they were with the time and effort I put into it.

Also, a guy from a group called The Dish Out, which promotes underground artists, happened to come by and asked me for an interview. [Here's the link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_ZoItG6IBw), if you're interested.

I know that this post might be a little off-topic compared to the usual  fare here, but I wanted to share my experience with you because I hope that some of you will be encouraged by it. I have spent many hours across the years being frustrated, starting and restarting projects, giving up and then coming back to it. But knitting is such a great hobby, and if you stick with it I hope that when the day comes where someone recognizes your skill you'll feel it was incredibly rewarding, just like I did.

So to all you new knitters out there, keep going! You have a lot of great stuff waiting for you down the road. And for all of you more experienced stitchers, I hope you've enjoyed it as much as I have! Hopefully we can all continue to have such positive experiences in the future. 




 So after many weeks of reading a few chapters here and there between classes and before bed, I finally finished A Storm of Swords. I only started reading after I saw all of the HBO series that's been released so far, so I really enjoyed seeing the incredible amount of detail that was left out of the show. But JEEZ is this book long or what? I haven't been as big a reader as I used to be since I started college, so this one felt like running a marathon after I hadn't done much besides walking around the block for the last four years.

So a few things I've noticed so far are that Season 3 ends at right about the 50% mark of the third book. However, the last scene of Daenerys liberating the slaves is put at the end of the show, while there are several chapters after that point which were also in the show but put in earlier. I have to wonder if the producers of the show did that because they thought Dany's scene was more dramatic, or if there was maybe some other reason influencing the decision.

Speaking of Daenerys, I'm also curious to see the direction they're taking in the show with her advisors, particularly Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. In the books, Barristan knows that Jorah was spying on Daenerys for Varys and King Robert, but this isn't revealed until just before the battle for Meereen, after Barristan's true identity is revealed. In the show, however, Barristan tells Daenerys who he is right away, and if I recall correctly he doesn't seem to be aware of Jorah's disloyalty because he was banned from small council meetings (even though this is exactly how he knew in the books). I'm wondering how the betrayal will play out because of these alterations.

Another topic I've been pondering is the fate of the remaining Starks. It seems to me like as soon as they start getting separated bad things happen, and the thought process seems to be that if only they could reunite everything would work out. Nearly everyone thinks that Arya has been dead the whole time, Sansa is being shuttled along from man to man and has no contact with the rest of her family, Jon is stuck doing his duty around the Wall, and Bran and Rickon have to remain unseen so that no one knows they're still alive. It's really terrible to see how cut off they are from one another, and how lonely each of them feels because of it, especially once they all hear about Robb and Catelyn dying at the Red Wedding. But at this point I'm not sure that getting them all back together would help anything. Sure, it would be nice to see them happy again, at least for a little while, but odds are something else would go wrong and they all really would get wiped out.

Well I've been rambling long enough. Does anyone else have any theories about some of the changes we'll see from the books as we start Season 4? Or perhaps some thoughts about the ending of ASOS? Because that one really threw me for a loop. 




 A recurring topic I've seen lately, both here on this subreddit and in other places, is how identifying as asexual fits in with sexual relationships, masturbation, or finding people's bodies aesthetically pleasing. There seems to be some general confusion, not only from people who are outside or new to the community, but also from some people who apparently have been with us for a while. So I wanted to bring this up for discussion.

Many people I've talked to, as well as those who come to the subreddit looking for advice on identity, have issues with these subjects. Most people define asexuality simply as "not being sexually attracted to any sex or gender." But then some people will say, "I don't want to have sex, although I still find some people cute." Or perhaps, "I masturbate, but it's mostly just a routine or chore." Or, if you're like me, you might have a sexual partner and regularly engage in sex with them.

I just wanted to emphasize the idea that *none of these things* negates your asexual identity. Not all asexual people are the same. Some aces enjoy sex or masturbating, but that sex drive isn't really directed at a certain person or group of people. Some ace people can look at a person and think, "they're an attractive person," but they don't want to have sex with them or anyone else who looks attractive.

To me, as long as you aren't sexually attracted to any sex or gender, like the definition above, it doesn't matter if you find people aesthetically pleasing or if you masturbate or watch porn or have sex. Because all of those things aren't necessarily related to your sexuality or how your identify.

How about the rest of /r/asexuality? What do you all think? And how do you all feel about these sorts of things? 









 Background: I'm 21f and asexual, dating a 21m straight guy. We've been together now for over 5 years.

Just a few months ago, my SO and I decided to try having an open relationship. I developed a crush on a close friend and he's expressed polyamorous inclinations for a long time now. So we mutually agreed that we wanted to date other people, but still keep our current relationship.

For the last few weeks, my SO has been trying to date various women he's found attractive, knowing that he has my blessing - after all, if he is able to get sex from multiple sources it really takes some pressure off of me, considering my orientation. However, he's been pretty much unsuccessful. Nearly every person he's talked to has said they are too busy for a relationship, already like someone else, or think he's really great but just "not their type." He is very understanding of their needs and reasons, of course, but it also sucks for him because he is a little disappointed. He's gotten somewhat depressed and frustrated lately with the whole situation.

I'm sort of in a dilemma over this, because I don't really know how to comfort him (or if I even should). It's a little weird for me, because I want him to be happy, but at the same time I feel like saying "well at least you have me, right? So you aren't totally lonely!" That doesn't really help, though. I know he's disappointed because he's trying his best but not getting anywhere, and he probably feels like he's not that attractive if no one really wants to date him. But on the other hand, I feel like the whole "woe is me" thing is a little bit sore for me since it's making me feel like I don't count for anything. Of course I know he loves me and appreciates me, it's just that there's this tiny little part of me that wants to be upset about the fact that he's acting as if he's foreveralone when I'm still here.

Am I weird for feeling that way? I'm trying really hard here to be mature and understanding, as he is certainly much more poly than I am (the crush I mentioned earlier is the first crush I've had - ever - and I'm not terribly into relationships in general). I guess I'm just a little confused about what to do here and I could use some advice.

Thanks for reading. 




 After watching all three seasons in the span of a week during this past summer, I soon started reading the books and I've really enjoyed seeing the differences between the two - especially the elaborations that the books give.

Right now I'm partway through A Storm of Swords, and I just recently read the section where Tyrion is attending a small council meeting after Tywin arrives at King's Landing and assumes his position as the Hand. As the council members were all discussing the war, the subject of the Vale came up. At this point, Lysa Arryn is still insisting on doing nothing except keeping her son bottled up in their castle where the nasty Lannisters can't get them, but of course this could change at any time and they need assurance she won't later decide to join Robb's (or any other potential king's) cause.

Littlefinger suggested that, since he is now a lord, he can marry Lysa and bring up her young son to be a loyal subject of King Joffrey. And he should leave right away - after all, it is autumn and the seas will soon be stormy, and he can't exactly marry Lysa if he drowns before he can get there. Everyone agrees, except Tyrion, who points out that they will no longer have a master of coin. So the others suggest Tyrion can do it, and Tywin agrees, as Tyrion had recently complained to him that his father never let him do anything important.

The clever part? Littlefinger leaves before Joffrey's wedding to Margaery Tyrell, and this wedding is going to be SUPER expensive. Oh, and the treasury is empty. Oh, and Tywin won't forgive the crown's debts to the Lannisters because if Tyrion can't make this work he wasn't worth much anyway. Oh, and on top of this there is still a war going on. Oh, and it was Littlefinger's suggestion that Tyrion take is job in the first place.

Of course Littlefinger's suggestion to marry Lysa and then essentially become Lord of the Eyrie (in practice if not in name, as the title technically belongs to Lysa's son) is yet another example of him being very ambitious. But I'm also pretty sure that he felt just as much satisfaction dumping Tyrion with the mess that was the royal wedding and laughing to himself while someone else, especially someone he doesn't seem to particularly like, has to deal with the headache.

Edit: I find it interesting how most of the comments have been about how I should be careful of spoilers rather than actually discussing anything in this post. They way I saw it, this post contains spoilers for ASOS so I had to label it that way regardless of what sorts of spoilers I was expecting ... Anyway, I get that I need to finish the books (and I will) but until then let's get back on topic maybe?

Edit 2: Names are hard. I have new appreciation for Robert Baratheon's impatience with titles. 




 I made a post last week [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/outhere/comments/1ovmxf/its_asexual_awareness_week_and_i_think_im_ready/) about my decision to come out to everyone I knew on facebook as asexual. A few people expressed interest and gave me well wishes, so I figured I'd post an update in case anyone is curious.

Strangely enough, most of the week went without much fanfare. The first posts I made, which were changing my profile picture and cover photo, got a few likes, even from family members. But I hadn't actually said explicitly that I was asexual at that point so for all anyone knew I was just being an ally like all those people who changed their prof pics to the HRC equals sign logo.

Next I posted the link to the Huff Post series on asexuality (which I also posted already on this subreddit), mentioning that people should read it if "you're curious about my identity." Suddenly, a few of the likes on my earlier pics disappeared, most notably the ones from my family members. As I live in a different city about an hour and a half away from my hometown I haven't seen or talked to any of these relatives so I have no idea what they think. The silence is deafening.

In better news, though, a few of my friends liked my posts, including articles, diagrams, and videos. One friend liked and commented on almost everything throughout the week and asked a few questions, and was completely cool with it. Another said he was a little confused because he was raised in a conservative religious household but he genuinely wanted to learn more so we'll skype together sometime soon and I can answer his questions. But the best part of the week was getting a message from an old high school friend I hadn't seen in years. Apparently she is also asexual and had come out to a few LGBT friends in the past, but they didn't respond well so she'd remained completely in the closet ever since then. After seeing all my articles, it gave her hope and joy to see that she wasn't the only person who shared this identity. I was really excited that I could do something positive for her, even if she wasn't ready to come out yet!

Although I'm still somewhat anxious about the people's reactions I haven't seen in person yet, I'm relieved that I came out. I feel like being in the closet is so anxiety producing because of all the uncertainties - how will people react? What if something bad happens? But now even if bad things happen I can actually do something about it instead of worrying all the time.

Well, enough about me! I know how difficult and scary it is to be open with people about your sexuality, so I just wanted to say that I will continue to encourage everyone else on here until they are ready to take that step themselves. Coming out is a long, hard, exhausting process, and you all have been here for me, so I hope I can do the same for others. : 









 For a long time I've been out to close friends but I've never discussed my orientation with family or with acquaintances or more casual friends before college. I've been on the fence for a long time about telling more people, especially my mom, but I kept finding excuses not to bring it up. "It's not relevant to the conversation right now." "I don't want to make them stressed out or worried about me." "I don't know if they'll accept me."

Well, I'm tired of excuses. Lately I've been coming out to more and more people, because I'm sick and tired of asexuality being a fringe group that no one knows about. I want recognition. I want people to see me for who I am. I don't want to be ignored any longer, in queer or straight spaces.

So this week, which is Asexuality Awareness Week, I have changed my facebook profile picture and banner to ace-related pictures. I'll be posting videos and articles that I find. If someone asks me about my identity, I will proudly say, "yes! I am asexual. It's just one factor in all the things that make me awesome." I don't want to hide because I'm afraid of judgement anymore.

I hope you all wish me luck, and I'll continue to support all of you as well :D 




 I've been following /r/knitting for a while now, and I love all the awesome stuff that's posted here! Especially some of the really cool socks. Often whenever I find a cool pattern I'm inspired to try it out and make it myself!

The only problem is, most sock yarns use wool. Like, at least 50% wool. And I'm terribly allergic to wool - I will break out in hives that don't go away for almost a week. It's painful and itchy and generally miserable. As I have yet to find a sock yarn at any of my local craft stores, I am kept from knitting awesome socks unless I want to turn into a giant rash.

Have any of you knitters out there found good sock yarns that don't use wool? I'm used to working with acrylic and other synthetics as they're usually pretty cheap, but I don't mind spending a little bit of extra money here - after all, socks are usually a pretty small project so I won't need to buy much. Please help me out of you find something you think would work! Thanks in advance :D

Edit: Thanks for all the helpful suggestions you guys! I'm really excited to try some of these out and finally be able to make some really awesome knitted socks. 




 I like to browse this subreddit for discussions about various VNs, but something that seems to pop up a lot would be posts that say something like this:

"I just finished [insert game here], and I really liked it. Can you guys recommend more games without nudity/H-scenes/sex scenes?"

It seems like it would make things a lot easier for everyone if we had a master post that was linked to in the sidebar which had a list of VNs that either didn't have H-scenes or had the option to turn them off. Or at the very least, it would be nice if we had a place to link them to whenever someone posted yet another thread like this. 




 So, yesterday I went out with my SO and our roommate. We're all 21, I'm a woman, SO is a man, roommate is a trans man (although he's been doing HRT for half a year now so he usually passes really well). We were out running errands and then had dinner, and last thing we did was run by our local Gamestore (not real name). All of us are really into video games and I think between the three of us we currently have half a dozen pre-orders for things, lol.

Anyway, we were in Gamestore and browsing around. We met another customer there who seemed pretty nice, roommate and I chatted him up about RPGs. SO was checking out controllers. And then roommate and I decided to ask for applications since we knew they'd be looking for temps for the holiday rush. Gamestore employee went to give us applications, and told us about a job fair coming up. We both took an application, I bought a game, and we all left.

After we got home roommate asked me, "Did you get a weird vibe from Gamestore employee or was it just me?" I replied, "Yes, totally!" Even though Gamestore employee didn't say anything to the effect, his body language and attitude made us both really wary. We had both gotten a feeling from him that he didn't like either of us. Roommate commented on how whenever I went to ask for an application too the employee seemed to look at me like, "what do *you* want an application for, you're a girl."

Again, none of this was ever explicitly stated, it was just the feelings we both happen to get. But whenever we asked my SO about it, he said he had no idea what we were talking about - he was totally oblivious to the exchange. Roommate and I chalked it up to "woman senses" - as he was also brought up as a woman, we were both conditioned to pick up on these sorts of things while my SO, a cis man, had never been made to.

Do you TwoX ladies know what I'm talking about? Do you ever get vibes like this? If so, share some of your stories! I'd like to hear them. 




 For those of you who aren't aware, asexuality is a thing. And a lot of aces (asexual people), like myself, have had many discussions about the community initialisms like QUILT-BAG or LGBTQIA (or any other variant) and what the A should stand for. Depending on who you ask, the A stands for Ally, or Asexual, or both. But a lot of ace people have a problem with this. Someone [recently posted something](http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1mep6a/reasons_why_i_need_the_a_in_lgbtiaq_to_stand_for/) to the effect in /r/asexuality.

I for one agree with the sentiment the OP expressed in that thread. Often, aces are completely ignored or dismissed, not just by straight cis people but also by the queer community. We just aren't acknowledged in most cases. But setting that aside, I wanted to address why I believe that having a special initial for allies is somewhat problematic. The most straightforward way to go about it is just to say that allies are not members of the LGBTQ community.

So, I realize that this sentiment is not held by all LGBTQ people and I will most likely offend some allies by saying this. But hear me out. I'd like to illustrate why I believe this with another example.

Say you are a Christian. And say that you have a friend who lives down the street who is Jewish. You hang out together a lot, and their family really likes you, so you often participate in some of their culture. Maybe you went to temple services with your friend a few times. Maybe you visited them at Hanukkah and exchanged gifts. You probably went to their Bar/Bat Mitzvah. You have different faiths, but you've always been supportive of your friend and try to stand up for them whenever someone else acts in a way that is anti-Semitic. Does this make you Jewish? Does this make you part of the Jewish community?

I would say no. At the end of the day, you go home to your family and you are still a Christian. You associate with them and you certainly aren't hostile, but you are not one of them.

I think the same sentiment applies to the LGBTQ community. Allies are great. They can be excellent friends, and they are certainly helpful when it comes to accomplishing positive change for our community. But they are not members of our community. They don't face our same struggles. They don't have the same experiences. At the end of the day, they go home and get back to their lives outside of helping us. So I really don't think they should be considered part of the community or get an initial.

Of course, this is not to say that I am not thankful for the help of allies or that they shouldn't be acknowledged for their own struggles. I just don't think they should be prioritized in such a way that they are considered full members of our community, especially since there are other GSM groups that still aren't fully acknowledged such as aces, or people who are agender or otherwise genderqueer.

Edit: Since there seems to be some confusion on the matter, the way I view things, allies are not a part of the LGBTQ community, but rather a separate group that works with us in order to promote change, especially against those straight/cis people who try to actively oppress us.

Edit 2: I am also of the philosophy that differences should be acknowledged and celebrated rather than ignored. I think it's much more meaningful when two people come together and say "You and I are different, but that's okay, let's be friends and work together," than when someone says "You and I are exactly the same because we're both human and that's all that matters." Not that the sentiment of the second statement isn't nice, it's just that it ignores the reality of most people's situations in the real world. 









 I apologize in advance for long text.

So, I'm a 21F panromantic ace, and for a long time now I've been developing feelings for a while now toward an old friend of mine (22F bisexual); we'll call her Lilly. I want to tell her about how I feel but things are kinda complicated so I'm not sure how to approach the situation.

It's important to note that I'm already in a relationship with a 21M (straight). We've been together for over five years now so this is a thing that will not end anytime soon. I really love him and I don't want to end my relationship with him at all. Also, he is completely aware of my feelings for Lilly, and we're in an open relationship, so this does not bother him.

But back to Lilly. Basically, we've known each other for the past seven or eight years; we were really good friends all throughout high school, and although we went to different colleges we've kept in touch. I still try to visit her whenever I can, although we don't spend nearly enough time together she's always happy to see me and it hasn't diminished our friendship at all.

Last year, Lilly came out to me as bi. She'd already known I was queer for some time, so she knew I'd be okay with it, but it was still a really big step for her. We both grew up in a pretty conservative religious community. She still isn't out to most of the people we know from our hometown because she's afraid of judgement from them. In fact, when she came out to me it was the first time she'd ever admitted she was bisexual out loud. As important as that moment was for her, I think it was really a turning point for me too. I don't know when I started to like her as more than a friend, and I wasn't always aware of these feelings, but when she came out to me I feel like suddenly something clicked in my brain. She wasn't completely unavailable to me, so I started entertaining thoughts of her beyond the purely platonic.

Since we've been friends for a long time we naturally talk about each other's relationships. She comes to me for advice all the time on how to deal with various people she's dated. And I've noticed that whenever she tells me about how she wants certain things from the person she dates, such as someone who can carry on long intellectual conversations but at the same time be silly with her, I find my self thinking "I could be that for you." And whenever she tells me about cute girls she hangs out with, I think "I wish you would go on picnics or get coffee with me instead." I'm not normally a jealous person, but I can't help but envy the people she tells me about a little because they get to experience things with her I've never been able to.

I've been reflecting on this a lot lately, and I want to tell her how I feel. But at the same time I'm conflicted about it, because she lives in a different city and I'm already in a relationship with something else. Although my current SO is okay with me seeing someone else, I don't know if Lilly would be okay with that arrangement. Not to mention that it would be hard to see her regardless, since she lives an hour and a half away. Plus I'm ace and she's sexual. I know that she's never had a serious sexual relationship with someone before (she's still a virgin, I'm pretty sure) but that doesn't mean she won't want to later on. I'm not opposed to sex (I'm relatively neutral about it) but since neither of us has had a lesbian relationship before it's a bit daunting.

If any of you have advice on what might be a good way to tell her how I feel or how to handle the logistics of a relationship (if it gets that far) I would really appreciate it. I've been really anxious about this for the past few months and I just needed to get this off my chest.

**TL;DR - I need advice on how to tell my crush how I feel about her. I've never had a crush before and my situation is complicated. Help, please!** 














 I always get a small burst of glee whenever I vote on something and it ends up being the 100th, 2000th, 550th etc. vote. I really like having even numbers for some reason. Not just multiples of tens or hundreds, either - I also like fives. Or repeating numbers like "3333" etc. 














 I just finished reading A Game of Thrones, and have read a few chapters into A Clash of Kings. I watched the series before I began reading, and while watching the show I thought that the whole story arc with Ned discovering that Joffrey was actually Cersei's bastard and not Robert's son was pretty believable. After all, there weren't exactly paternity tests back in medieval times, and unless it was entirely obvious that a kid didn't belong to one parent (i.e. the affair was discovered, or the child clearly resembled its true parent rather than the one who supposedly contributed) you stood a pretty good chance at nobody finding out about it. Cersei could easily claim that all her children just take after their mother - after all, their father was her twin brother, not some other random knight that they might resemble, so they just REALLY look like her. And in the show, there aren't really many other hints about the fact that Joffrey isn't Robert's kid outside of Ned Stark's investigations.

The book, however, was a completely different story. There are hints dropped everywhere - for instance, in the lineage book that Jon Arryn and Ned both looked at, it talked about two previous marriages between a Baratheon and a Lannister where the kids all took after the Baratheon side. There was also Sansa's comment about how Joff was not at all like his father, which made Ned finally realize the truth. At Joffrey's birthday tourney, his younger brother Tommen wears Lannister colors instead of Baratheon ones when he goes to fence. Plus, nearly every other time Joffrey or his siblings are mentioned by an outside party, they lump them in with the Lannisters by habit.

So my question is, if it was this incredibly obvious in the book that Cersei's kids aren't related at all to Robert, why aren't more people discovering this much earlier on? I know it gets revealed at large eventually, but really ... Joff is 12 years old at the beginning of the series. This seems like an AWFUL long time to keep a secret that seems so poorly hidden.

Anyone else have an opinion on this? 



















 Trigger warning for descriptions of abuse.

Okay, so, I recently went to a therapy session where I talked about some stuff from my childhood. So here's some background info - I am the oldest of three children. My mom had me when she was single, but when I was about three she married my stepdad. They then had a boy when I was five and another girl when I was nine.

We were never a totally functional family; most of this had to do with money issues, and I know my parents' marriage was terrible, as my mom was pretty much miserable all the time. Whenever I was little I assumed it was because of me (like a lot of kids do) and this caused a lot of conflict between me and my mother. Add that to the fact that my stepdad was working most of the day and then whenever he was home he was too busy drinking to ever really have much to do with us kids, and I basically ended up in an environment where I had no one to talk to about my problems.

The biggest of these problems was my younger brother. He has always been mentally unstable, and went through a wide range of possible diagnoses as a kid until about a year and a half ago when he was officially diagnosed with Asperger's and Generalized Anxiety. He not only has problems with social interaction, but he also has an extremely volatile temper; he would completely freak out at people over the littlest things that everyone else didn't really care about. I might me talking about something completely unrelated and he would take it as a personal attack against him.

And with that temper came a lot of violence. He would often get upset at me and then hit me, or break my toys, or throw whatever was closest to him at my head. As we both got bigger I retained a physical advantage for a while - I was four years older, so I was stronger and could run faster, making it relatively easy for me to run away and hide in my room whenever he started exploding. I would have to hold the door shut, though, because he would grab chairs or other large objects and literally try to break my door down in an attempt to get at me.

It only got worse once I got into high school, as he hit puberty and started catching up to me in size. I'm only 5'2" (about 159 cm). Pretty soon he was nearly as tall as I was, and about as fast. We would get in fights and I couldn't escape completely unscathed anymore. I started getting defensive wounds - welts, bruises, scrapes, pulled hair, bloody lips. And once I got to college he was actually bigger than me. I remember the first time I came back home to visit he got upset in the car whenever we went through a drivethru and I told him he shouldn't order [Vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_\(soft_drink\)) (a drink that was basically a hybrid soda and energy drink) partly because he wasn't supposed to have any caffeine, and partly because as soon as he said he wanted it my little sister immediately wanted some too. That didn't go over too well. On the ride home he reached up from the back seat to punch me multiple times, tried to smother me with a pillow, and screamed and swore at me almost constantly. I was silent the whole time, as I didn't want to provoke him any further. My mom tried to calm him down but she was limited as to what she could do since she was driving.

Whenever we finally got home, I walked with my little sister up to the front door, and mom went to get some stuff out of the trunk. My brother screamed at me again for a little while and then took off around the side of the house into the back yard. I thought good riddance, maybe now he'll leave me alone. He didn't. While he was back there he grabbed a gardening stake from our vegetable patch and then came out to the front of the house again. I was still waiting by the door, since my mom was the only one who had keys. My brother started yelling at me again, and then swung the stake at my head. I threw my arm up in defense and he hit me there, leaving a huge swollen bruise. My sister jumped out in front of me and shouted at him to stop hurting me, and he nearly swung and hit her as well, but decided to just smash the stake against the house instead, which promptly shattered it and sprayed us with splinters. At this point my mom came up and let us in the house, and told my brother he was grounded and to go to his room. I was livid because I was tired of taking this shit from him and told my mom I was calling my friend and going to her house for the night. She tried to get me to stay as I started packing but at that point I was sobbing and nearly hysterical so I told her no, I couldn't, I was leaving.

On my next visit home a few weeks later I said something my brother didn't like and he ran outside, then came back in with one of the broken off pieces of that same gardening stake and tried to stab me with it. I barely managed to run into the laundry room in time to get the door between us.

After describing this story and several others to my therapist, as well as two different instances in the past year or so where I was suddenly triggered by something and started having mild panic attacks, she said I show symptoms of PTSD (although it's not full blown - I don't have enough symptoms for an actual diagnosis). At this point in my life my mother is now divorced from my stepdad and we have a good relationship. She's started to see more of my brother's temper now that I'm not there anymore to take the brunt of his anger, and she now knows what my life has been like this whole time. She's been committed to getting my brother treatment.

But I've fallen out with my stepdad over this issue. He's in complete denial about anything at all being mentally wrong with my brother, refuses to take him to therapy appointments or even regular doctors visits, and won't give him his meds for days at a time. For those of you who don't know what happens when you suddenly stop taking your antidepressants, imagine someone who goes from smoking more than a pack of cigarettes a day to quitting cold turkey. It messes you up. He's making my brother worse, and he won't acknowledge I've been abused. Every time I talk to him, he tries to guilt trip me, saying that if we get in a fight it's my fault because I'm the oldest and should know better, or that I should be more loving and supportive of my brother. He's basically facilitating the abuse, saying that I somehow deserve it while simultaneously dismissing my suffering. I couldn't handle it anymore so I stopped visiting him, and the last time I spoke to him voluntarily was two Christmases ago.

Part of the goal of my therapy is to help me deal with the trauma of the abuse, but I also want a better relationship with my dad. The problem is, the only way for us to work on our relationship is if he acknowledges the problem with my brother first, and he refuses to do that. I have really mixed feelings about my stepdad, and I don't know what I can do or say to make him understand where I'm coming from. I don't want him to apologize or make up for anything that happened in the past, I just want him to admit that it happened so we can make things better. But I don't know if that will ever happen or if I'll just end up never speaking to him again. Any advice?

**TL;DR: My brother frequently abused me from childhood up until college and it's left me with some symptoms of PTSD. But my stepdad won't acknowledge that there's anything wrong with my brother, and blames me for the abuse whenever it does occur. Now I'm not speaking to him and I don't know how to fix our relationship.**  
























 So, there's a convention this summer in my city called [Fandomfest](http://fandomfest.com/en/), and I'll be doing four hours of panels for it. One of these will be called "Bat-Girls!" - a mostly lecture-style panel about all of the women of the Batman universe.

This will be the first time that I've ever done panels for a convention let alone a Batman related one, so I figured I'd go to you all at /r/batman for any helpful suggestions you'd have for the following:

1. Which heroines should I feature/focus on? I was thinking of doing a rundown of the female Robins and Batgirls (obviously, I mean it's in the title) but are there any other noteworthy heroines I should discuss?
2. Which villains should I highlight? I think Ivy and Harley are definitely noteworthy, but what about some lesser-known ones?
3. Also, I would like any recommended readings you could suggest for each character that would show off the best aspects of each woman/girl (e.g., read issue such and such to see Barbara doing blah blah).

Thanks in advance for all of your help! I recognize that I need to do the bulk of the work, but I want this to be a really good panel for everyone in attendance and not just "watch test_subject6794 talk about all her favorite Batman moments for an hour," so some different perspectives will be greatly appreciated!

**TL;DR:** I'm doing a panel at a convention about female characters in Batman comics, movies, and shows. Thoughts? 









 Ok, so I'm a short woman (even below the "short" threshold for this subreddit) and as I was browsing through some of the comments /r/short a thought occurred to me.

For pretty much my entire life I've been made to feel insecure about my height. I was one of the tiniest kids in every class in school and I got picked on a lot because I was too small to fight back. Even close friends constantly poked fun at my size, knowing that I was insecure about it. I am also constantly mistaken for being younger than my actual age - commonly four to five years younger.

Ultimately, a lot of the teasing also affected my self-esteem; among other reasons, I felt as if I was unattractive because my physical size made me appear less mature. I was never described by anyone as "hot" - the most I would occasionally get was "you look cute." I hate that word. I constantly feel as if I am being treated like a child. It doesn't help that I also have a very young-looking face and practically no boobs. Whenever I first started dating my SO (who is 6'0"/183 cm) people would make jokes about how I was so young-looking it made him seem like a pedophile or cradle robber. Now I am approaching my 21st birthday; I applied to get a library card about two weeks ago, but the person at the desk assumed I was still in high school and needed a parent to get the card for me.

So my question to men on this subreddit would be, have you also felt that your shorter stature has made people talk down to you or patronize you as if you were still a juvenile? Or does it affect you in other ways? Do you feel like people still treat you like a boy, or is it something else?

**Edit: If your first instinct after seeing this post is to make a comment about how short people just need to suck it up or how tall people have issues too, don't. That's not the point of this thread. The point is to see if there are any differences across gender in how height discrimination affects short people.** 




 I know most people on this subreddit have questions about issues that pertain specifically to themselves, but this one is about someone else I know - I hope that's okay.

Basically, I've been dating the same guy for almost 5 years now. I love him a lot and I've gotten closer to his family over the years, including his older brother.

Now, the brother (we'll call him T) is a generally nice guy; a little nerdy, average-looking, but funny and intelligent. I'm sure he could get along well with just about anyone. But he has a problem. Whenever we spend a significant length of time hanging out, T inevitably brings up the fact that he doesn't have a girlfriend (he is a straight, cis male btw). Most people have had the single blues at one point or another, but T is severely inexperienced. He's a virgin, he's never kissed anyone, he's never been on a date, and I'm pretty sure he's never even held hands with someone. And he won't stop complaining about it. Most recently, I went with him, my SO, and their parents to one of their other relative's wedding and he skipped half the reception because he was overwhelmed with all the lovey-dovey stuff I suppose, and I had to go and console him about it for half an hour.

Now, I don't mean to be selfish - it's not just that his complaining annoys me (although it does, to some extent). I'm also really frustrated about it because I know how he feels. My current SO is the only boyfriend I've ever had, the only person I've been intimate with, and until I met him I was just as lonely and hopeless about my dating prospects as T is now. I get where he's coming from. But every time I try to talk about it he just gets really angry and upset and won't listen to anything I try to say to make him feel better. I really care about him and I know for a fact that there is at least one girl in his life who would be willing to date him, so I want to make him feel better. But I really don't know how to approach the subject since he never talks about it unless he's feeling really upset about it at the moment.

If any of you have been in his situation, or in mine, and have some helpful advice about how I should approach the situation or things I could tell him, that would be fantastic. I want to be sensitive to his feelings and I know that me hanging out with his brother all the time probably feels like we're rubbing the fact he's single in his face sometimes. But on the other hand, he's really starting to frustrate me as he constantly asks if anyone I know is single or if I'll set him up with one of my friends, and he complains A LOT about how "forever alone" he is. I just want to help him so that we'll all be happier.

**TL;DR:** My SO's brother is single and has no experience with girls. He's really depressed about it and he's starting to bum everyone else out about it too. What should I tell him? 




 Ok, so I know this is a little late since ME3 came out quite some time ago. Forgive me. I started playing the first game on a friend's xbox, but then he moved and I had no way to finish it on my ps3 until the box set came out more recently (huzzah!). It took me a while because I was kept busy by school and whatnot, but I finally finished off ME3 and now I'd like to enter the discussion about it that I've been avoiding in order to keep from getting spoilers on everything. So without further ado, here are my opinions about ME3 (note: all the following spoilers are ME3 specific).

I have several complaints about this game. First, the way it tracks your progress for galactic readiness. I can't think of any good reason to keep it fixed at 50% from the very beginning to the very end of the single player campaign. At first I thought maybe this was the developers attempt at impressing upon us the idea that everything Shepard does is ultimately futile. But then I played a round of the multiplayer, and suddenly my progress shot up by 6% and that theory went out the window. This makes absolutely no sense to me. They put a big progress bar in your campaign, but it's only affected by online matches, and otherwise has pretty much no discernable impact on your campaign? Then why the hell is it there?? It just makes me feel completely impotent every time I look at it, and I played through the entire campaign before starting a multiplayer match so I know for a fact that this thing is completely useless to the actual story.

Second, I felt like everything I was doing was ultimately futile. I'm no stranger to doing the most inane things in a game purely to fulfill sidequests or get achievements for the sake of being a completionist. But I really felt like there was no point to doing any of the sidequests in ME3. Probably because no matter how many extra resources I gained my "galactic readiness" never budged. But perhaps also because this game felt like one huge, drawn-out ending to me. Because it's the final piece of the trilogy, everything is wrapping up and whittling down to one final conclusion, so it basically made all my choices pointless since I'd still end up in the same place. There was all this work but all the payoff was delayed until the very end, with the final choice of the game, and no individual choice before that really mattered - your outcome only changes after doing huge chunks of side missions. So why do I bother?

And that payoff was lousy. I know understand why so many people had a disliking for the ending to this game. Oh, guess what, Shepard? [No matter what you do, you're boned. Choice A: you die along with most of the galaxy. Choice B: you die so you can tell the reapers to fuck off. Choice C: you die so that your DNA can somehow be used to make everyone into cyborg ... things.] (/spoiler) Wow. Such a broad variety, how can I ever choose? It honestly felt like they were taking the heavily polarized moral system and applying that to your endings as well - you get your your renegade ending, your neutral ending, and your paragon ending. And none of those is really worth all the effort, if you ask me. Your only reward for hours of your life dedicated to this thing is [how many crew members will pop out of the Normandy in the final cut scene.] (/spoiler) There is so little difference between any of these endings that it makes me wonder why I didn't just play eenie-meenie-minie-mo to pick one.

Don't get me wrong, I love this series, and for the most part ME3 was a pretty solid game. But their management of the multiplayer features and the ending they seemed to pull out of the developer's asses really killed this last game for me. It felt like a major disruption in an otherwise interesting and seemingly well-thought out series.

All that said, what are some of your guys' thoughts? Did you enjoy the ending or no? What did you like or not like about ME3? I'm curious to find out!
