 The man is a genius. He just plays stupid, so people like him more.  Everyone loves a fool.  




 Say that to their face. Let someone record it first... 




 Did someone really get paid to "find" this?   




 I wouldn't know.  I missed it, for a reason.  




 Fuck you.  Littering is never Ok.  




 Of course it matters.  




 My vote is on asshole trolls from outer space.  




 Not if they have a dash cam or someone else is a witness to you breaking for no reason.  




 Fuck you and everyone that cares for you. You're what's wrong with the roads.  




 Are you a cop? No, then fuck off out of the left lane.  




 Yes.  Rules of the road.  




 I am so happy right now.  




 Is it that horrible to live there?  




 I can't decide if this is a good thing, or a fucked up country.  




 I came here to say this, about.  +1 




 Are you passing someone? No? Then you shouldn't be in the left lane!  




 Don't be in the left lane in the first place then!  




 GET OUT OF THE LEFT LANE THEN!!  He's not the tailgating asshole, you're just an asshole!  




 I had two girls want to make that deal with me, after I asked them out.  All I heard was "you're to ugly and not rich enough yet, but if you look me up when you're rich..." 




 You ARE an asshat.  No justification.  




 Point is, this guy was a negligent ass.  No one should have to handle this due to a "mechanic" who knew about it!  




 You're a careless, thoughtless, asshole.  I wish bad things on you.  You said you knew and let it go. Fuck you. Fuck your family. And fuck you again.  




 I have but one up vote to give.  




 So, I was half right?  




 No, no you can't. Not only would the elections take forever to dry out, but it's the rest of the car that is really fucked.  Mold in the seats, mold in the doors, rust everywhere.  Water gets into places it was never meant to be and doesn't have a way out.  That's why insurance companies always total flooded cars.  




 I thought you could only legally make and sell porn in California and Florida..? 




 I don't know what you did, but I assume you drive like an idiot.  I'd have to be furious to throw food.  




 My wife is a horrible cook, but she at least knows and admits it.  




 I'd go off on that bitch.  Touch my food and we have issues.  




 That IS common knowledge.  




 I showed this to my wife. She's really mad.  




 Fuck that guy.  




 Nice try, NSA. 




 I hate that he said that do much, I almost down voted you, for typing it.  What an ass.  




 Except for the fact that you have an a/c leak that isn't going to be fixed with a can... 




 Thank the diy ac recharge kits.  




 I'm not sold on the fiesta.  There is a rather large selection of after market performance upgrades for the focus st and several message boards dedicated to enthusiasts.  




 I have 2014 focus ST and I love it more than any car I've had before.  Fun, fast, and great as a daily driver.  




 This times a thousand. Traffic engineer people.  Listen.  




 Try speeding up then.  




 One car length. If you leave more than one car length between you and the car in front, I will take that spot.  Keep up with the flow of traffic people.  




 Best. Job. Ever. 




 Where are you supposed to put your beer then?  In some secret fridge?  Asshat 




 Sold meth at a rave.  




 And that kids, is how I met your mother. 




 What about the traffic jam that people cause by stopping in the road, as opposed to pulling off? Example, on a normal four lane street (two going each way), a person stopping in the street blocks off one lane and backs traffic up for miles (sometimes during rush hour).  Why don't people driver up another 100 yards to a parking lot or side street? 




 Kind of a sucker punch, but that guy deserved it!

DAMN, YOU GOT KNOCKED THE FUCK OUT! 




 That's do dumb it gets fooled by decoys.

do dumb

DO DUMB? 




 Were you high on pot or LSD? 




 I guess I forgot to finish reading.  My bad. 




 If I was in this situation, I would go to his house, talk to his parents, find out when he will be home and give him one chance to make with the photos.  Digital copies before I went anywhere/let him out of my sight.  I would not directly threaten physical violence, but he would be able to tell from the look on my face that his well being currently in jeopardy.

Sometimes an ass kicking or threat of ass kicking is the quickest solution to a problem. 




 Not going to tell what the sub reddit is..? 




 Do you know where he lives?  Pay him a visit.
