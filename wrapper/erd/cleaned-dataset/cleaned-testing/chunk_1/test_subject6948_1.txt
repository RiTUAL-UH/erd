 I can tell you right now that there aren't any anime characters on the roster currently. The rule for third-parties (and, by extension, fourth parties) is that they must have had an appearance on a Nintendo console, their games are well-remembered, and made an impact on the console they appeared on, or gaming in general. An example is Sonic, Mega Man, etc. 




 I'm definitely thinking options to change things like airdodges and such, but I kind of see what you mean. I think that I may keep one general speed, but customization on a character before you select a stage would be interesting, kind of like choosing a kart in Mario Kart.  




 Yes, this means that we'll be implementing techniques from both. For instance, pivot grabs from Brawl will be added, and we're contemplating a lot of different techniques from Melee, such as moonwalking. 

For characters, a lot of moves are taking more reference to the character's origins. While this does spice up characters a little bit, characters like Dr. Mario (assuming we add him in later) will likely take more scrapped parts from their original counterparts to make them more unique. A example off the top of my head would be that Mario gets the F.L.U.D.D. while Dr. Mario keeps the Mario Tornado.  




 Hi, I'm test_subject6948 and I'm developing a game currently titled "Super Smash Bros. Affinity". It's main goal is to take the best from Smash 64, Melee, Brawl and SSB4, and put it into a free online game that people can pick up and play. Currently, a very basic demo is expected by July, but I need some fan input. Here's what I can tell you so far:

-The game is sprited, similarily to that of Smash Bros. Crusade and Smash Flash 2. We're currently using sprites from other sources in the demo, but custom sprites will be added soon. 

-The game's main goal is to focus on improving veterans and mechanics first, but we can promise you that many newcomers will appear eventually. 

-The game will attempt to reach the speed of Melee, but appeal to Brawl players as well. 

-We're mainly keeping it to Nintendo and some of it's third-party affiliates. 

-A variety of Nintendo characters will appear, such as Mario, Link, Samus and Ness, alongside newcomers such as the Balloon Fighter, who's main focus is stage control and lightning-fast aerial combos, as long as you avoid getting your balloons popped.

-Stages include iconic locations from previous games, such as PictoChat, Mario Galaxy and Onett, as well as new stages like Mt. Dedede and Kokiri Forest. 

I'd truly appreciate the input on ideas or suggestions, and a link to some in-development pictures is below. Thank you for your assistance.

 I've got the Tale of Desperaux for the Wii. 

That ought to be a funny video.  




 MEGA MANS EVERYWHERE.

IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY RAIDED CAPCOM'S DUMPSTER. 









 I get to live out my dream of fighting boxers, plumbers, gorillas, princesses, monsters, knights, demons, aliens, spies and bounty hunters as a small blue robot. 

My life's complete.  




 I have very basic coding skills (small webpage basic in HTML, to be exact), but I'm always trying to learn more.  




 I was thinking to myself a few nights ago, and with all the Classic Mega Man stuff happening lately, I thought up two ideas for Mega Man fan games:

1. Mega Man: Worlds Collide. Basically, it's the Mega Man Archie crossover with Sonic, but in game form! Play as Mega Man or Sonic, and fight the 8 Roboticized Masters (Shadow, Knuckles, Amy, Vector, Charmy, Espio, Blaze, Silver) and summon in Tails or Rush for assistance. 

2. Mega Man Smash. Mega Man vs. the 8 original fighters from Smash Bros: Mario, Link, Samus, Kirby, Pikachu, DK, Fox and Yoshi. 

They're kind of stupid, but I'd like to know if anybody else would be interested in doing this before I scrap 'em.  




 Let's see:

Super Mario 3D World (5/5)
Pikmin 3 (5/5)
Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD (5/5, only get if you don't own it on GameCube)
Nintendo Land (4/5)
New Super Mario Bros. U (4/5)
Sonic Lost World (4/5)
New Super Luigi U (4/5)
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures (3/5)
Scribblenauts Unmasked (3/5)

I highly recommend 3D World and Pikmin 3, as well as Lost World and Nintendo Land. Also, try out Rayman or Donkey Kong, and definitely get Mario Kart and Smash when they come out.  




 I'd personally keep Pika, Puff, Lucario and Red (with Squirtle, Ivysaur and Charizard) snd add Mewtwo. But a standalone Red, Meowth or Zoroark would be kind of cool too.  














 Looks like this leak is officially debunked. You said that Rosalina was an AT, yet now she's a playable character. Don't fret, Shulk and Little Mac supporters!
