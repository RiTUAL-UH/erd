 First of all, there's gonna be people clicking at like 12 seconds because internet. Then when it really gets to 10 there will be nothing but clicks, all of you once pure greys will become 60 Second players feeling regret like I do. Do yourself a favour and not click at 10 seconds.

 If you're using the Steam Community Market to ever value something then don't, it's near pointless. Unless you mean market like just in general, in which case, yeah you're good I guess. 




 How is violet so low? Honest question here, it's my second favourite and I've been able to sell them higher than any other sheen when I sell them on backpack.tf or tf2outpost 




 Owner of a Team Shine RL here, I used to have a DD sheen on one and a VV Festive one, I'm personally liking the TS sheen more than the other one, specifically on Blue. 









 I hope I win the Stout Shako :]  
  
Also great job!

 Out of curiosity, when are you giving back that money you stole from those guys, OP? 









 No horrible voice acting for the Soldier? Today is a good day.

 Helen Clark's Own Professional Killstreak Grenade Launcher 




 It's really good, I assumed it would be pretty trash since there's Lenny Face right there. 




 If I had an Australium, I would name it "New Zealandium Rocket Launcher" in a heartbeat. 




 Can you tell me the name and post? I'm curious. 




 Only premium players can get random crits.  
  
Your backpack must be more than 1 bud to get mini crits.  
  
If any of your classes have a Gibus, Pyrovision Goggles or Mann Co. Cap you cannot get Random Crits. 




 If I had 26 buds I would believe you, the actual trade was 1 scrap for my Quadwrangler.

 Considering that Reddit is like "Nah dog this was posted too recently" I'd say it's been long enough to get reposted. 









 We all mess up sometimes.... ^^^^^dingbat

 I'll give you a unique Eyelander for it. 




 I saw 420 kills on something once. That's pretty high. 




 You ding bat, I used /s  




 Why are you renaming unique weapons? Rename stranges. /s 














 Already there. 




 /r/itwasagraveyardgraph! 




 I've heard about Market Bots before, but how do they work? Do they refresh the page until an item drops below a specific price? 









 You don't even have a circlejerk. 




 Yeah, when it hits 0 it reset. It's gone to 0 about 10 times now.

 I'll shove a leak up your ass in a second. 




 I wish. 3 




 lmao no 




 (Critical Kills: 421)  
  
You missed it! 




 mfw i was waiting a day to post this thread to contrast my original thread  
  
Anyway, the best rename I've seen is absolutely  
  - "Download my mixtape"  
  - "www.soundcloud.com/the-shaman-of-ramen"  
  
His mixtape is fire but I guess that's why it was his Flamethrower heyoooooooooo.  
  
It's mine. I called it that. I'm proud. 




 As someone who played Engineer today and needed to fix my Sentry, REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 




 Are you dissing his spelling? 




 That's kinda the point 




 I'm guessing Sasha Grey is there somewhere. 




 Adolf Kritzler. 









 Sounds pretty /u/test_subject7026. I'm sorry, I needed to say it before someone else did. 




 The name is actually pretty clever, I won't lie, but the description ruins it. 




 Here's mine,  

 - BOOM, Headshot.  
  
 - Point and Click Adventure  
  
And of course,  

 - abcsddjjjjjj

 Don't fuckle with Shuckle. 




 I would personally have a  
  
- Cool Cat Cardigan painted Black, because then I would look good in ANY decade!  
  
- Boston Boom Bringer, because my heart's a stereo 3  
  
- Merc's Pride Scarf, because it's pretty cold in the Southern Hemisphere but I dislike the Muffler.  
  
- Buds.... I listen to alot of music, I'm sure most of you would have buds on this list.  
  
- Fed Fightin' Fedora/Killer's Exclusive, M'lady.  
  
- Digit Divulgers, because it is still cold down here.  
  
- Buck Turner All Stars, you know I got me some of them dog.  
 
- Stereoscopic Shades, because they just look cool.

 Buying Pitchforks 8 keys pure 




 Fantastic backpack, I really like the unus- Oh my god buds are 8 keys. 




 afk back to runescape mode  
  
Well it is the Easter Event, he really needs those eggs! 




 Reskins like the pan or the Lugermorph don't count, neither do Stock.  
  
Hard Mode: None of the actually horrible ones, so basically what are the 5 worst weapons that aren't listed by everyone and their mother. 







































 100 damage seems higher than normal, especially if it's been a solid 100 with no 99-101 just always 100. I used it in a pub today and it just stayed at 100 on everything. This seems like more than normal. 




 You use guns.  
The new heist DLC is a rip off of MvM due to people leaving before you finish.  
There are many hats  
Cosmetics, too  
There is a first person mode  
You can shoot rockets at people to make them die  
There is a minigun that when you use you go slow.  
  
/s 




 Title. Seeing as the most important tier is OU, are they really over used? It seems like they're just being used now.  




 I would personally give myself max cash and buy all the PK gear I could, get some rare items; Phats, Halloween Masks etc, max my skills and do drop parties in the Falador room. I would also put some cash into the well of goodwill. 



















 Now don't get me wrong, Muselk is an amazing content creator and tf2 player, but does anyone else notice a huge spike in usage for Mad Milk Atomizer Scouts or Diamondback Spies? Normally when I see one of these I just let them do what they do, but when we have 9 of the same loadout on a team, it gets kinda mundane. His loadouts are for the most part relatively average, but people are taking them as being the undeniable best loadouts (Even though he says in his Soldier video that there is no best class) Has anyone else noticed the large amount of his sets in TF2 lately? 









 Feel free to yell (Voice)MEDIC! Because that's what I'm here for, to heal you in your darkest of times. If you're on full health, yell out to me anyway, an overheal is indispensable these days. (get it? Because a dispenser can't give you an overheal. I thought it was pretty funny.) If you're a Baby Face's Blaster Scout then I'll heal you in a couple of seconds, You're a pretty quick guy. If you picked up a health kit when I'm on low health then I'll give you a quick overheal and wait for it to come back, When I'm on fire and you're a Pyro, I don't hate you for not airblasting, you might not know how to do that, maybe you don't know it puts out a player, and I'm fine with that. But I swear to god if you wear a Lime Green or Pink loadout I will never heal you. Because Y'all look stupid. 









 Ahh, the age old question of 'Should I set people on fire or should I use a stick to hit people already on fire?'  
  
  
Please don't be mean to each other, be mean to the weapons 









 So tomorrow I can buy things off the market again, I'm thinking of getting an Aces High unusual (not gonna say what because I don't want somebody to buy it just to be a dick). I heard it was broken, can anyone confirm or deny this? 




 Please, pick up money when one of these two situations arise, the first one is when I, as a Scout, have passed away, think of it as my dying wish. The second time would be when you kill a robot really really far away from the big group of players.  
  
I know you're thinking 'But Scout, it's your job to pick up the money, and it helps you by giving you a huge health boost!'  
  
While that may be true, I cannot get all of the money all of the time, and the health gain, while being extremely beneficial to me, isn't always too important to me, by the time I have picked up $20, I will already be at around 250 hp, it doesn't hurt to stand on money, In fact, it probably feels good seeing as you can brag about how rich you are since you can walk on money and it probably feels really soft.  
  
  
Kind regards, /u/CringeWorthy 3 









 Emboar Is available as a mystery gift, the best part is that Emboar has their Hidden Ability just Serperior did, just go to the Mystery Gift, Select Receive Gift, Receive with code, then type in POKEMON500. Have a nice day :] 




 Even though you can get unusuals, you're going to be [uncrating alot of junk] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwO8b9iq34) it's more worth it to buy a quicksell for 10 keys or even buy them from the community market, it's a waste of money to uncrate with the amount of unusuals you're not getting compared to how many you do get. 




 So I was in a little plane in GTA Online and some guy in a huge jet comes up to me and tries to shoot me outta the sky. I had my Kinect on and was going 'Come on man I just wanna fly' and he sounded like a 12 year old going 'NO FUCK YOU I'M GONNA KILL YOU' so I made an evasive move and flew directly up and he exploded. So I promptly yelled 'THESE ARE MY SKIES MOTHER FUCKER!! KNEEL BEFORE THE MIGHT OF THE CROP DUSTER!'   
  
  
I made a little thingy to show you guys what it was like for me.

 So let's face it, the EoTL update was pretty overhyped for what we got, but why don't we look at the positive things we got from this year, I'll start by saying The Base Jumper is one of the greatest things to mess around with weather you're market gardening or rocket jumping or even just being a troll. What do you guys think were great things from this year? Some nice cosmetics? The BOOST you get from the Baby Face's Blaster? Or even just a tweak to an older weapon?

 Place a sideways sticky piston with a slime block next to it. Then place a slab on the top half of a block. While it's moving you can see a sideways half slab. Side Slabs confirmed!
