 My grandfather has the same set as well. He actually just gave them to me, along with an old spokeshave. 




 Isn't this what you weird goth people wore along with ample amounts of chain? 




 Top left-hand corner anyone? 




 Nothing on this thread is really that creepy but this made me shit myself 




 It's already begun. My chin...it...it's gone. Tell everyone you can. Please. The dawn of the chin-snatchers is upon us. 




 Hahaha - "chin" as in chinchilla. However, I think you know that. 


Just kidding. I'm coming to steal your chin. Beware. We are coming for you. 




 I'm sorry you had to depart with your chin - that's a shame. But yes, they are extremely sociable and smart little creatures. I let mine run around an hor or two a day and give him plenty of chew toys. He seems to be happy. I've only had him for a couple months.
 




 Mine is just so fuzzy and little. Certainly not a threat to the paranormal.  




 If anyone/anything tries to do this to me, I'm screwed. I have a chinchilla 




 It pains me to read that your parents treated you like that. One of the better stories on nosleep, in my opinion. I hope to read more from you.  




 This was wonderfully written. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it; however,  this didn't actually happen,  did it? Excuse my naivety.
