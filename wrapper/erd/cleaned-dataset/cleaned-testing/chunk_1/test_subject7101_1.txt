 it's running a bit better but still pretty bad lag in some parts

they need to fix it so there is no lag runner games like these can't have stuttering/lag issues makes it unplayable  




 lag has always been a issue with the game but i ever had it as badly as i am now after the latest update

horrendously lagging like a son of a bitch causing me to die a lot (even losing a 250 combo just before the boss!!!)

i'm on android  galaxy S5 




 would be nice

i can say though top 999 needs a score of at least 2.5/3 million 




 friend requests pile up with no option to reject and no option to remove current friends

seems like something that should of been put into the game a long time ago
 




 noticed that after i posted i checked my bulletproof and it needs 600 to get to the 5th star

complete waste of ISO 




 just noticed that the bronze medal is 50 ISO-8 (100-999th place)

you need to get over 2 million to get it though i got 1.7 million yesterday and made it 740th place by the morning i was down to about 1100-1200th place

quite hard for me to get more than 2 million with a 28 multiplier but at least the chance to win a lot is ISO is back 




 3.4 million for me in this event placed me in 14th place 




 it's a waste of ISO-8 IMO but if you have the money to burn it will be at the bottom of the screen if you don't have the necessary card for it

if i'm not mistaken it's like 200 ISO-8 to rank up a six star spider.. that much ISO-8 could buy you 16 discount premium portals 




 most games like this don't do it for the powerups especially when the vials have no other use (as of yet)

the game already makes you use premium currency to buy the portals which is the most important thing to upgrade your spiderman..

you have to use a lot of it if you're unlucky like me and never get the spider you need 




 that one actually sounds good but i don't think i've ever got a ben riley one

lost many combos the extra 4 seconds sounds pretty good 




 starting with 10x counter is pretty useless.. using a spider that gives +1 on near miss or +1 when you kill a enemy over the course of even a short run will give much more then the 10 from the beginning. 




 they shouldn't have a event portal as a prize if it isn't ready from the beginning of the event

often if you unlock it before it's ready you don't get it when it is 




 my favourite 2 are the +1 near miss and +1 for enemy kill (battle damaged and bulletproof spiders)

i find for me they are the only 2 that are worthwhile and can build a huge combo

 




 got to the point where i bought the 80,000 vial upgrade only to realise if you want to upgrade it again you need to spend ISO-8

what is the point of vials if you can't upgrade the powerups all the way? literally that's all the vials can buy (except when you spend 500 when you want to waste a useless spiderman to add more xp to another)

why couldn't they of just made them even more expensive (like 160,000 vials then 250k or whatever.. 




 i watched a few youtuve videos of the gameplay and it just look like a updated 2013

also the engine sounds are terrible and sound nothing like the real 2014 cars 




 didn't get my event portal after getting 20k in the event before it finished.. (event portal was available when i got 20k)

the game has been really glitchy lately 




 pretty sure that's what we're stuck with now.. 

i'm in the same boat i'll get a score good enough to stay within the bronze medal then leave it for the day 




 i think they should people you up against people of a similar level atm it's just the level 90's winning everything 




 always wondered why they don't give 1-3 clams when you level up in the game 




 they changed the rank required for silver medal it's now 10-99 (bronze is 100-9999) not only impossible for those with lower multipliers but a bit unfair on people who get high scores that get screwed over with a bronze medal

i think they increased it because it's 50 ISO-8 but it's hard to achieve
i wouldn't mind if it was less ISO-8 so more people could actually have a chance to earn it 









 i wish it was only at the beginning for me i've lost at least 3 100 combos in the last few days and always before one of the bosses since it just doesn't recognise some of the near misses 




 is anyone else having issues with near misses? for me it doesn't register some of the near misses which has caused me to lose 100+ combos i'm even incredibly close to the objects when this happens

only happens a few times during the runs but it's incredibly frustrating to lose a combo because of it 




 think i know the part you're talking about it's got me a fair few times 




 whenever i die in this game it's always on the easiest part of the track.. like jumping to early or late or going for the near miss combo and just screwing it up

when the track is full of stuff dropping and enemies everywhere i never seem to screw it up only on the easy parts. 




 i hate the level up system.. either pay iso-8 or wait til you get the same card and then waste 2 similar cards to level up and you have to do that EACH TIME!!!!! obviously geared to get you to pay for iso-8

because of this there are people with level 90 spiders already (or they hack) and they just own the leader board because of the score multiplier.. you just can't compete with them if you have a 7 score multiplier  




 yer i got 3rd in the event and won him.. going to be a royal cunt to rank him up though 




 it will be the death of the game when a large majority of people who don't want to pay $100's of dollars to rank up spiderman stop playing 




 i hate the rank up system in the game and have been playing nothing but events lately because i've hit a road block needing a level 35 spiderman to continue.. 

even that sucks because there is a few people with level 90 spiderman that i have no chance to match their scores of 1-3 million with my level 30 spiderman with a much lower score multiplier 

game is massively geared to get you to pay for iso-8 for instant rank up or to get the right premium spiderman to continue 




 it's the worst rank up system.. so clearly designed to get you to spend money on iso-8

would take months to save up enough of it to buy the premium cards and get them for ranking 




 they should have a event that's based on how far you get not the score 




 been playing them a lot recently as it's all i can do and probably the best way to make any currency

hard to get in the top 10.. people with scores of a million or more i'm lucky to get 250k before stupidly stuffing up on something easy 




 downloaded it the other day it was fun at first but when you get up to the missions that require a level 35 spiderman the game gets ridiculous

the amount of iso-8 you need to level up is ridiculous and you got to be lucky to get 4-5 of the same premium card and another 2 to level them up

obviously geared to get people to pay otherwise it would take months to even get enough (other endless runner games aren't this bad)

takes away from the fun of the game when you hit a roadblock like this

  




 i hardly ever get battery drops so i have to wait the 4 hours for one zap and in that time he appears on more buildings

got like 3 in my town right now (one on a building i need) and just not getting any batteries

really don't want to spend clams getting them because they are a bit overpriced.

how often do you guys get battery drops? 




 not even close although i haven't been playing much recently.. i'm finding it more of a chore to unlock him then fun and it's only going to get worse when higher level characters are released. 




 they are a bunch of idiots 




 ferrari staying out 




 i think ricciardo will win this one just have a feeling hamiltons tyres won't last and he'll pit or ricciardo will get him with the fresh tyres.. 




 i have a feeling Hamilton will have to pit again 




 those clouds look pretty evil i wonder if rain will hit before the end 




 i wonder if the conspiracy theorist hamilton fans will claim the spin was because of sabotage of the brakes they seem to think everything bad that happens to his car is sabotage 




 they are cold because he had to start from the pits 




 3 weeks really isn't that long between events, if you don't use clams you have to grind them out collecting whatever and to me the game is becoming more of a chore then fun

they should space big events out by at least 3 months and have smaller updates like the toy boxes or something similar to fill the gaps between 




 i hate when games put big events out so soon, events need to be spaced out so you don't get tired of the game and this one most likely will be similar to the last with collect x to get y or spend a zillion clams to get it now..

too many events so soon and you get burned out on the game (especially since many are probably still unlocking stewie or trying to get the toy boxes) 




 does it really surprise you? they are desperate for ratings with how shit the show has been over the last few years 




 i thought they said it was a iconic or great character that will bite the bullet.. rabbi krustovsky is not iconic or great and has only been in like 10 episodes i think..  




 there really isn't much premium content worth buying and most is horribly overpriced

i'm just glad they have been giving some out for free in recent prize boxes. 




 at first i liked the collect x item for skin etc but now it's getting ridiculous especially for what you have to collect to get stewie.

i realise some people would collect it quick then be waiting for the next item but anyone that can only play this game once or so a day etc would be put off in having to grind so much to unlock a character.   




 ever since the moon idol event i've been getting constant freezing.. the game doesn't crash it just freezes every 30 or so seconds for a few seconds then starts again

anyone had this happen (i'm using a S3 but it was fine before that first event) 




 now stewie is around the corner i regret wasting so much money on the prize boxes during both events.

i have a feeling it will be like when you unlock Tricia and you'll have to unlock the land around the funhouse first before even repairing it which could be 50k upwards.
 




 whilst i am playing the game will freeze for a few seconds then go back to normal then it will do it again 20-30 seconds later.. it doesn't crash completely just freezes and starts again

only started happening during the event.. anyone else getting this?

i'm using a galaxy S3 




 yes they have stopped for me 




 anyone know a fix for this? game just constantly freezes for a few seconds then goes back to normal literally every minute or two only crashes a few times but it's annoying as hell.

only started happening during event (galaxy s3)
 




 is anyone else having this issue? i'm on android and when i try to buy a box of coins the purchase confirmation screen shows tank of clams for $106

all the other options work fine just that one isn't right.
