 Looking for non-rooted stuff, GO Backup came up as an app that will save your contacts, messages and apps. Must have root to save app data, but if all you need is a way to easily save and re-install favorite apps it seems good enough. Lots of other options if you do a little searching. 




 Yeah, and it isn't even complete. I use Titanium Backup myself, and there are other options for restoring favorites.

But if you want to re-download favorite apps from the play store, try this...

Click the My Android Apps tab

Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click My Orders   Settings

There you'll find your most recent downloads/purchases. Keep in mind it shows all store stuff, so books, music, ect. will be there as well. And if you click the settings in there you can adjust your device list.
 




 That's probably the best bet for most folks. Installing anything other than from a providers site or the play store can break your TOS. Even taking your phone in with the Unknown Sources box checked can break it. 




 Those are all neat launchers. Another one I really liked was Rocket Launcher, but mostly because it seemed to confuse most folks. :)
SPB Shell was a *really* nice launcher for showing off my phone. The idle screen is unparalleled. 




 ...is that a llama up there? 




 Yeah, I'm digging the whole ICS experience myself atm. But I've been using Holo over the other ICS launchers. I was using Apex so I could put widgets in the dock, but they're just unsightly there. With Holo I can still put folders in the dock (which gets rid of my need for Folder Organizer) and I'm loving the app drawer. The favorites tab is my goto spot to launch apps from.
The current favs atm for ICS seem to be Apex and Nova. 




 Yeah, I didn't really want to put up the market Chinese link, it's still in the xda thread if someone really wants it. It's still one I haven't tried yet, though. I'm a Holo fan atm. 




 There are a ton more, but most link to other sites, are other languages, or simply too shady for me to feel comfortable with pointing anyone to them.
Personally, I mostly stick with the Play Store and Amazon for the free daily apps. I only made this list out of boredom one day, and haven't put much into updating it like the others. 




 Thanks, I've got more hours than I can count into these (mostly the launchers) but I'm going through the browsers now and hunting up more. 




 I try to keep the lists updated and as comprehensive as I can. Didn't see anything here, so I thought I'd share with the redditors.

 You're most likely going to need a task manager, like Tasker or NVC Task Launcher. 




 ....front page. This is an excellent example as to why I lost interest in Reddit.

 Training Day is one of my favorites. But, damn, there are a *ton* of good cop movies.

edit: the more I think of it, the more great ones come to mind. L.A. Confidential is probably in my top 20 of all time movies. Fallen is rather cool, too. 




 Beat me to it. I've drilled for quite a few of them. And I've seen some churches hide cell towers in their steeples. Any way to disguse them, they're doing it. Folks want more and better coverage, but don't want to have to look at them. 




 Nope. I can see it, though. I'm pretty sure you're family was killed, and you're flashing back to the past all the time. I can't remember if the whole thing takes place in your house or not, but it's very dark, gothic, and weird. 




 I'm pretty sure that's not it. 




 Aargh, I know this game, hold on, I'll think of it...
 




 That thing is actually like 6 feet tall.

 Huh. Guess we're screwed. 









 So, you're putting quantity over quality. You're spending so much of your time and resources on making bigger and better looking games that you're surpassing your ability to do them correctly. But as long as people keep eating them up you can move on to the next project feeling justified, I guess. 




 I was working off the Chesapeake Bay and it was below 0 at night. I left my water sitting on my rig and when I saw it the next day, I wondered why it wasn't frozen. The moment I picked it up it froze solid in less than a second. Everyone left water bottles out that night. :) 




 Best Part: So many things. It's unreal how it changed my life.

Worst Part: The scary times. Serious accidents, illnesses, when I'm in a public place and I don't know where she is for a moment or two, etc. That feeling of dread is far worse than any I've ever felt for myself over the course of my life. 




 lol 




 Get someone who knows about such things to install a remote kill switch for the car, and give the remote to your brother. When he knows she shouldn't be driving, he just clicks, and they go nowhere.

Realistically, though, you could have just about anyone who knows about cars put in a regular hidden switch that keeps the car from running. When someone knows she shouldn't drive, they sneak out to the car and flip the switch. Bet it wouldn't cost ten bucks. 




 Um, sounds about right to me. What's your gripe? 




 No, but I have a few I use. Which one I use depends on what kind of comment I want to leave. 




 lol All vid games are like that. But I guess it's all about how you use them. I play here and there, maybe a couple times a week. 




 You mean it's finally dead? Woot! 




 Meh, no. If the ads look like Resident Evil to me, I'm pretty turned off. I'm sure it's "not the same game at all", but it's rare that a FPS game can grab me. Or worse yet, a third person view when you simply shift from target to target with an auto-aim. They all really get monotonous.

I'm pretty hooked on the MMORPGs. I've tried tons of them, paid and free (and there ARE a ton of them.) Dealing with people makes for a much richer experience to me. (For whatever reason, the biggest one, WoW, bores the hell out of me though.) 




 PC only here, too. But I enjoy TF2 quite a bit, still. My game of choice, though has been the same for 6 years, City of Heroes. 




 Sorry :( the best I can do now is toss you an upvote...

 Looked like it could be. I clicked the pack instead of the single, saw it was still under ten bucks, so decided to go with it. Surely, thinks I, there must be a couple people who would like to try it out... 




 Got 3. First come, first serve... 




 Too many of you are bitching that it's light beer. A couple of my favorite American beers are light. You don't need heavy lager to get good taste. That's not the problem here. A beer fan drinking Natty Light is like a wine fan drinking Thunderbird. Cheap as hell? Sure. But it's not worth drinking that crap for the extra cases they're getting, not to mention the blow to their social statuses. 




 Amen. 




 ...can I have the coffee mug? 




 *cough*TheVeronicas*cough* 




 lol I think you win. 




 You can sort according most any criteria you wish. I have almost 300 in my instant watch queue, and this is a god-send. It doesn't just sort it in your browser, it sorts the queue itself, so when I start up Netflix on my Google TV, it's sorted by genre first, then in alphabetical order (my preference.) 









 I played it a lot back in the day on my Tandy 1000sx (dual disk drives woot!) but never won it. I'm trying to find a copy of it, but coming up with zilch. Anyone have any ideas?

edit: NM, it's freeware now with it's own site. I quit looking too quickly. 




 Also, steam has awesome holiday sales, not to mention weekly sales on random games. If you decide to go with steam (which I'm loving) make sure to only buy the games you absolutely must have now until you see them on sale.

I think I got over a thousand bucks worth of games this past xmas for less than 200 bucks. I can't remember buying anything less than 75% off, and still have more than 50 or 60 games I haven't even tried yet. 




 Capital One is probably the biggest credit card company. And if you can't get one there yet, get a secured card, by someone like Orchard Bank. Capital One will send you an invite soon if you balance that one well.

If you get a card, use it. Put 30 bucks a month or so on it, or just use it for gas, or something like that. Don't just start using it for shopping. You can quickly get pulled under, then the charges start.

And make sure you pay it off on time, every month. Finance charges are how they make their money, and they make a LOT of money. Those charges will be like throwing your money out the window while you drive down the road.

If you find out you don't have the self-control to use a card wisely, then cancel it quick, and stick with a secured one. 

Just google around a bit for credit advice. You'll see the smart tips being repeated if you spend the time to really dive into it.

And JReitman is right. Don't use them if you don't have the cash to cover them. 




 Never played it. When Majora came out, we were too busy with other stuff to even turn on the TV. It was a few years before I got back into gaming. 




 For a while now he's been all about using his computer as a media center with all the other TVs hooked into it. He lives in a lake house on a lake in Kentucky (his retirement home.) And he's just out of the hospital from some sort of lung infection + pneumonia (on-going problem, had half a lung taken out years ago.) I'm trying to figure out something other than my old standby present, a Hickory Farms assortment pack. He loves them, but surely he'd like something new, and I'm at a loss for ideas really. Got any good suggestions? 




 Zelda's Ocarina game was great on 64, too. Plus I drove myself batty on Shadowman because I didn't see the ledge next to the gondola for at least a week. My friends and I played Perfect Dark all winter one year during lay-off.

And I think I agree with most of [this](http://ign64.ign.com/articles/081/081042p1.html"Loved me some Banjo Kazooie!") list. 




 I was just debating this myself a couple of weeks ago. I went with a written one. I've found that I'm much more likely to jot down a note than to open a program or app and type something in. When I was using Google Calender, I found myself having to put it off until it was convenient to do so, only to end up forgetting to do it. Plus, it's just quicker. 




 [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Damazontv field-keywords=seasame+street x=16 y=18) has a few on pay per view, and plenty more on dvd. [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiSearch?oq=seasame+street ac_posn=-1 v1=seasame+street search_submit=) has some, too. Free, though, I don't know.
 




 Cool peanut butter use: The next time you have chili, take a slice of bread, coat the top with peanut butter, fold it in half, dip it in the chili, and be utterly amazed at how good such an odd combination of foods tastes. 




 Everything I've tried has resulted in low frame rates. :( 




 At first I figured that it'll be little more than a chat channel for whatever teams join, since I'm sure you won't be able to keep a window open with all members in it. It would be huge. Though I'm sure such a window will be available. Just not practical during gameplay.

But what would be awesome is if when you joined the league, it recommends you to join such and such team, attempting to balance the teams out, distributing healers and tanks and such. 




 I remember those. However, I never knew anyone who actually bought one. 




 So much for my paying attention to things while on a game break. So in i20 we can form leagues? Essentially 48 member teams? Has anyone seen how this is going to work?
