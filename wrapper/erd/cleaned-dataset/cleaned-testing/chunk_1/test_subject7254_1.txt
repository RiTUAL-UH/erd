 The petulant boy king speaks... 




 The Patriot Act wasn't about patriotism. It was about control.

The Affordable Care Act wasn't about affordability.  It was about control.

Net Neutrality isn't about neutrality.  It's about control.


Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free. 
-Ronald Reagan

 




 Those pesky facts are finally surfacing.

But, like Jay Carney said 9 months after our men fought for their lives all night long as no fingers were lifted in Washington,

"Benghazi was a long time ago." 









 100 inches of snow in Boston.

The most ice on the Great Lakes in recorded history.

Longest period without a hurricane hitting the US mainland in recorded history.

But:
Up is down.  Down is up.
Any dissent of newspeak will not be allowed.
Forward, comrades! 



















 I'm sure his next speech will cover the epidemic of black-on-white murders, robberies and rapes in America.

No, he'll just worry about people's speech. 




 You actually believed that? 




 Oh the ways the elite reddit intelligentsia ties itself into logic knots justifying the non-stop corruption and lies of the Democrat party. 














 Pai asks. "Can you think of any regulated utility like the electric company or water company that is as innovative as the Internet?"

The Internet is the strongest entrepreneurial force in the history of the world and the last bastion of pure freedom.  Leave it unregulated! 














 "Under my plan of a cap and trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket"

Barack Hussein Obama, 2008 









 You're right, giving people money to do nothing will teach them to feed themselves. /s 









 Seem to have struck a nerve here!
How's that fundamental transformation working out for you?
50 million people on foodstamps?  Yes we can! 



















 She knows. She's just establishing dominance. 









 Liberals love the 14th amendment, equal protection under the law, except when it applies to the rich.

Then they want to apply disproportionately high income tax rates on people simply because they make more money.
 









 Yes, the Third World is colonizing the United States.  If you oppose this, you are "racist". 




 There are many sources who say Morsi was not legitimately elected and was chosen to appease the MB.  

But that's nice of you to support a terrorist dictator who immediately begin attacking non-Muslim minorities when he began to rule.

 




 "The tensions between the two nations have escalated in the last 18 months after the Obama administration suspended the sale of certain weapons to Cairo in the wake of the Muslim Brotherhood leaders removal from the presidential office in Egypt."

Yes, Obama supports the terrorism-connected Muslim Brotherhood.
It really can't be any more obvious.
 














 No one has a Constitutional right to buy flowers from you. This is not a freedom of speech issue for the couple. 




 The US Congress was not involved here.  Did you read the article? Having the Legislative branch of the federal govt involved in the sale of a bouquet of flowers between private citizens would be the antithesis of the Constitution and any notion of a free state. 




 Who are really the intolerant ones here?
In a free country you would be allowed to chose who you do business with. 



















 Will your opinion change when they are on your continent?
In your country?
In your state?
In your hometown?
In your neighborhood?

The civilized world is going to need those 3 percenters again.
 









 Anyone else think it's a little Orwellian to have an 'Education Minister' ?

Absolute power always corrupts.  Remember this when you support the Dept of Education's control over our schools. 














 Another over-promoted, disconnected elitist. 














 This is significant analysis.  No one else has mentioned this anywhere.  The definition of "significance" should have nothing to do with volume of original content, but the..uhh..significance of the content.

This is not rehosted content, but a unique and profound observation. 




 I am Barack Hussein "I will stand with the Muslims...my Muslim faith...civilization's debt to Islam...Muslims have built the very fabric of our nation...the Muslim call to prayer is one of the prettiest sounds on Earth" Obama, and I approve this beheading. 




 Pulling the race card to avoid tipping on a big check?

Yes, stereotypes are usually true. 




 We need to realize this will eventually affect our lives outside of the computer screen. 




 In before the mass gargling of Muslim semen by the Reddit intelligentsia. 




 Like I said before, I'll take him. 




 I'll take the word of an Army Colonel that has been in combat fighting terrorists against a proven Islamic sympathizer from Columbia University.  But that's just me.

 When you begin your quest to become an American citizen by evading federal and state authorities you should not be allowed to become a citizen. 




 The IRS targeted conservative, American citizens wholesale and Congress did nothing.

Obama enacted executive amnesty to increase the Democrat voter base and Congress did nothing.

There are no more statesmen in Washington DC to represent us, only politicians. 









 Don't worry, it has a nice, cozy word like "neutrality" in it.  What could be so bad about it?  /s

If you believe in freedom, take the red pill and oppose Net Neutrality! 




 "My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government."

Keep the Internet free and unregulated! 




 When we quit using the phrase "N-word", you'll know racism is over. 









 You magnificent bastard.

The Affordable Care Act wasn't about affordability, it was about control.

The Net Neutrality Act isn't about neutrality, it's about control.

The Internet is the most entrepreneurial medium in the history of mankind and the last bastion of freedom in the world.  
Keep it unregulated!   




 Financial collapse?  Yes we can! 









 So who decides what a "reasonable" perspective is?  You? 









 Keep in mind Al Gore said the ice caps would be gone by now.

 You'll "solve" terrorism when you "solve" rattlesnake bites.

The attackers are almost exclusively North-African, Middle Eastern or Pakistani Muslims.

Celebrate diversity! 









 There are two options to cease continual warfare: surrender or achievement of victory.

Don't let the faint-hearted convince you things are different this time because we live in "modern" ages. 




 "So you shouldn't go blaming the whole religion because a minority of the people are acting like fucking asshats."

You mean like Obama did with Christianity? 









 Obama's right.  We should just sit back and absorb the car bombs, shootings, and beheadings.  We deserve it.  /s 














 "Dominance established"

 Evil didn't stop existing in 1945.



 









 I call bullshit on this story.
