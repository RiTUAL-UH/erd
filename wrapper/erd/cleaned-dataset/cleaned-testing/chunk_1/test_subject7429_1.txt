 Agreed. 




 Drapes would be too interesting. 




 Yes. 









 It's've* 




 Oh, you're too kind, dear.  




 I know someone like this. He's a dear. 




 /r/dragonsfuckingcars and /r/avacadosgonewild  




 Examples? 




 My manager who used to work at a casino in Louisiana said that he would see the Duck Dynasty guys all the time and they would lose ridiculous amounts of money on a regular basis. 









 Whoa 




 Studying for math. 




 I remember the first time I played Oblivion. After leaving the sewers, I didn't turn around, so I had no idea the imperial city was right behind me. Just spent two hours walking around looking for one of those damn cities. 




 I think the most interesting thing about a WWI game would be the fact that they combined (at the time) futuristic weaponry with very obsolete strategies. That's one of the things that made the war so devastating. It wasn't only trench warfare, a lot of interesting things could be done with it.

 They've announced Lobo as the first DLC character. 




 What did your grandmother ever do to you?

Edit: and now my joke makes no sense... 




 It actually works on low and high attacks. I'm not very good at hitting it at the right time, though. 




 I think I'd enjoy MK style mechanics over SF style. Street Fighter has just never really appealed to me that much. Just my two cents. 




 You, sir, are a poo. 




 Actually, a project called "Version Two" was supposed to be made into Battlefront 3. First Assault was gonna be a marketplace game to help fund the soon-to-be Battlefront II sequel. 




 Wait, people don't do that? What do they say now? 




 Yeah, I think it's RMCF, I remember the one in Winter Park, CO had one outside. 




 Man, this is totally shopped. Get out of this subreddit, poseur. 




 Feminists are so conceited sometimes. I swear to god, they think anything to do just with men is an insult to them, somehow. I once held a door open for a woman and she started screaming at me about how I'm doing it because I think she's "weak" and because she's a woman. Bitch, I don't care what gender you are, I was just being polite. 




 Russia isn't, sir. 




 If you want a Star Wars shooter, there's a pretty cool mod for CoD 4.  




 Since I work for mainly tips, fuck you, you can't have my services. 




 And "you all" just takes god damned forever. 




 No one ever said touching boobs was to make WOMEN horny.  




 In Alaska, it's illegal to push a moose out of a moving airplane. 




 Childhood: Reengaged 




 We all know perfectly well that that's a fucking simulator. 




 You, sir, have never lived. 




 Oh, how true this is, comrade. 




 To put it simply, Tolkien really didn't like technology. 




 Wales *is* pretty big, guys. 




 That stupid men think about sex every 7 seconds thing. I just think its a ridiculous statistic that I'm fairly sure was made up on the spot by someone. 




 *ahem* Rage *ahem* 




 "Ahh.. Pop that pussy for a real nigga
Pull out my black card, that's my lil nigga
Make a movie with your bitch, Steven Spiel nigga"

Oh, Lil Wayne... What would we do without you and Steven Spielnigga? 




 I can't blow my goddamn nose. 




 That's an awfully curvy L, don't you think?

Edit: in all seriousness, though, that's pretty cool. 




 My parents and I all thought I was just high energy, then I was diagnosed with ADHD. Aren't logical fallacies awkward? 




 Relevant username. 




 Totally just read that in Nigel Thornberry's voice. 




 Dude, me too. Fuck rainbows. 




 You smiled at your sex as the door shut? 




 As someone who works at a car wash/detailing place, I can relate. I can relate so gooooood. 




 A friend of mine was at the Olympic training center for archery and met Michael Phelps. When he tried to say hi, Phelps just said, "Fuck off," and walked away. 




 Hit the nail right on the head. Exactly how I feel, man. 




 /r/dragonsfuckingcars 




 Same thing with my Granddad's lab. I would stare for a few minutes until I was sure I could see breathing. 




 Canada. 




 I am devastated by how long it took me to get this post.... 




 I don't know about others, but I say it quite a lot. 




 AlienBlue 




 If you look closely, you can see that this is shopped. 




 Oh, my god, you just saved me so many hours of sleep. 




 It's sucking my will to live! 




 Heart disease? 




 Play-Do: Fun to play with, not to eat! 




 That guy must've been like, "WOOHOO! New profile picture!!" 




 That's some Wile E Coyote shit, right there. 




 As a lover of history, if absolutely love to have this. 




 Ah, yes... I've heard of these so called, "flagged posts" 




 Nothing like milking your feet for the fhrer. 




 Much more fuel efficient than racing with cars. 




 Ghost probably pushed him. 




 That, sir, is not an apple, but a larger than average strawberry. 




 Am I the only one who's more interested in who's between his legs?

EDIT: I apologize for my awkward word choice. 




 This is essentially Japan's wet willy. 




 Nice pin stripe! 




 I've been fairly lucky with my first gen PS3 still kickin'. Though the fan sounds like a Boeing. 




 Would a "put.... Put your dick in it" be relevant here?  




 Totally thought a car was gonna hit him at the end. 




 Am I a bad person if I saw black face immediately? 




 I stopped going to the fridge at night because I'd accidently leave the milk in the glass cabinet.... 




 If you aren't making eye contact you aren't doing it right. 




 It literally took me 2 minutes to see the damn goat. Ashamed. 




 The fact that that happened to her is kinda morbid, but the general post is kind of uplifting.  




 Well, from the video he could've easily been white, so you did make assumptions.  




 Put... Put your dick in it... 




 She's cuuuuute. Kinda. Like in a baby kitten road kill kinda way. If it were covered in more dead kittens. And then had that volcano on her face added on for good measure. 




 A Russian exchange student at my school told me it's just highly recommended.  




 "Ur" repetitive. 




 She should go pro! 




 He died instantly.... The next day. 




 I've heard they also have villages where they send people with HIV and AIDS to die. 




 THE TABLES HAVE BEEN TURNED
