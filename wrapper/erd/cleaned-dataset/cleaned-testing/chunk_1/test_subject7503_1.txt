 I still get nightmares. In fact I get them so often I should be used to them by now. Im not. No one ever really gets used to nightmares.

 In my town we have a "Jesus Runner", He's a man in probably his 50's who runs all over town almost every day while carrying a large painted cross with wheels on it. He's been at it for years. He's also a really nice guy doesn't push religion or preach to anyone. He just runs and carry's that cross.

Heres The Deal

Since 2003, weve set up and organized Childs Play, a game industry charity dedicated to improving the lives of children with toys and games in our network of over 70 hospitals worldwide. Over the years, you as a community have answered the call and come together to raise millions of dollars.

Childs Play works in two ways. With the help of hospital staff, we set up gift wish lists full of video games, toys, books, and other fun stuff for kids. By clicking on a hospital location on our map, you can view that hospitals wish list and send a gift.

Childs Play also receives cash donations throughout the year. With those cash donations, we purchase new consoles, peripherals, games, and more for hospitals and therapy facilities. These donations allow for children to enjoy age-appropriate entertainment, interact with their peers, friends, and family, and can provide vital distraction from an otherwise generally unpleasant experience.

Also happy B-Day and this is one of the best contest ive seen on ROAP. 




 I would really like too have Torchlight 2 on steam, im broke as all hell and my cpu is good enough for D3 or anything like that, but TL2 looks amazing. 




 I once let a friend buy me for a day for 20 bucks. She had me do all types of stupid shit, her laundry, her nails, cleaning, cooking. Then after the two hours of that wore off she started to get creative. She put me in a skirt and tank top and had me go to our local video store and rent the most off the wall porn (rim jobs, interracial gay porn, granny, tranny, gay gang bangs, ect ect). After that fun she had me get naked and run around the apartment complex a few times, had me make her dinner, tuck her in for bed, sleep on the floor so I could be up early to make her whole family breakfast. Tons of different things for the remaining 24 hours, pack her bong hits, call her mistress, rub her feet. Then as the time was winding down she pulled the whole "i want you too eat me for the rest of your time". Needless to say I did. That was the best bag of bud Ive ever had. 

The whole eating her out thing didnt happen. But a few months later it did and we hooked up for a few months. Man she was awesome.

 Some people just want too watch the balls burn. 




 My mew tattoo is waaaaaaaaaaaaay cooler.  




 That is true dedication. Congrats fellow issac bro. 




 Yeah that worked out perfectly. Great way too end out a video. 




 I liked it, You have good sound balance between you and the game. It has some humor that wasn't forced or dumb. You got lucky as shit with the two clips. 

All in all keep up the good work.  




 Pure joy. Also a sugar rush. 




 No you didnt. More importantly hes 22 and his parents wouln't let him have a girl sleep in his bed. What the hell? 




 Oh Wesley.

 My mom got me a PS2 and FFX but forgot to get a memory card, so i told her and she said ill go pick one up tomorrow. So instead of waiting I played for 23 hours non stop until she got me the memory card. Then I saved and went to sleep. 




 Nope moot visited 2chan all the time and the something awful forms before he made the 4chans 




 The rules were made by Gaia fags.  




 It does suck, but I still have my PS2 so its not to inconvenient, still sucks though. 

I swear if the new gen on consoles pulls this no backwards compatibility shit im gonna flip out. Its bad enough that I have to use two consoles to play some Playstation games, and another two for some Xbox games. At least Nintendo has made all of there last systems games work and stuck with it.

 I think this sums up everything I have too say.

 So one day in 2005, I get up and notice I have some kind of spider bite on my inner thigh. I slept in the basement so thats what I chalked it up too. So I get outta bed and start getting ready too go to work since i overslept. As im getting dressed my leg starts throbbing and swelling, I say "eh" walk out the door to work. As im walking I can feel it hurting and swelling more and more. Make it to work, get told to get in the kitchen someone called off (the other guy who closed with me) and we are busy as shit. So I limp on past the GM and a normal manager. They ask whats wrong I tell them, get in the kitchen, bust out all the orders for about maybe an hour.
 
Thats when the pain set in. On a scale of 1 to 10 I was at a 50. So here i am on the floor, basically in tears, all sweaty and holding my leg, while the other guys in the kitchen make food. Manager comes back asks whats wrong, I tell her I have too leave something is really wrong with my leg and I cant work if I cant stand. Here is what she tells me "If you leave you are fired, that's not coming from me thats from the GM" I flip shit "What the fuck do you mean he left like an hour ago" 

Apparently as I came limping in the GM (who was a piece of shit human being to begin with, thats another story) Tells the manager "I bet he and Nick (guy who called off) are up too some bullshit they probably planed this out, If he tries too leave fire him". 

So I do end up leaving going too the hospital and turned out that I had MRSA. MRSA is some serious shit if you dont know if it gets into your blood stream it call kill you. So I get an IV pain pills all that fun stuff, get a doctors note saying that I cant work until im healed. Call the manager tell her whats up she tells me, Im still fired and she will mail my check too me. 

So too finish up, after i can work again, I call the higher ups, tell them what happened, we have a meeting with all parties involved, they admit they did wrong and agree too hire me back. They tell me too come in on Thursday, I come in on Thursday and they say "we told you wednesday your fired agian."

Cunts

 Well crap, Guess I'll get it on my next play through thanks for answering buddy.

Love me some J-roc. 




 I forgot all about it until it was too late.  #3232;\_ #3232; 




 Not that one but a few songs from it. Also do I have to sign up for that site because I can't d/l it. 




 I actually own all of those CD's long time DFD fan and also all the side bands and relate able bands. Too bad there isnt going too be another Alter Boys CD (Since Dunn or so I think).  














 I thank you for your dedication and your contribution. 




 And we're off and running. 




 i will try that thanks 




 maybe just a little :D 




 As am I, I was starting too drool thinking about it, and thanks I still have no idea how i made something that cute.  




 http://imgur.com/c0vCv

I asked and it was deliverd thank you so much, also here is the picture of my daughter Aya gettin down on some pizza crust. :D 




 So im a broke ass father, my daughter is loaded up with food due too me spending all my food card on her and a little for myself a few weeks ago. So here i am 2 days till my food card gets anymore on it, and I just relised i have nothing but ramen left for myself. Please Reddit i really dont wanna go 3 days in a row on pasta.  




 Have an upvote sir. :D 




 Lets see the last time she saw her was about 2 weeks ago for about 2 hours and thats because I told her come see her. Before that it was easily over 3 months since shes seen her. Ill give a few attorneys a call and see if any of them say anything helpful. I just have a feeling that somehow someway she could turn it all around on me. and make herself out too be the "victim" she is quite good at that. 




 I have no idea if i can, and no she doesnt pay anything never has prob never will.  




 I haven't went there yet, ive asked my case worker too file and she hasnt done shit. Also when she was around 5 months the county she was born in had me come in for childsupport, I did, and I explained everything too them so they dropped the case on  me and told me that my county will pick it up. My county hasnt done anything. 









 Im 58 hours in and only at 67% -_-.  Gotta love the randomness of this game and the challenge. I really want too get all the items before the update comes out, its going to add 100 or so items, new pills, 5 alternate levels for the existing ones, a new level on the end. So worth buying if anyone hasnt. 

 Congratulations OP. 



















 That was such a great game. Firing up the emulator now.  




 I'd love too have Ryu from Ninja Gaiden. You are awesome for doing this.  




 I like too sneak into peoples homes and leave money in different easy too see places. 




 I picked up on that one too. Good eye.  
























 I shit all over myself.  









 I dawww'd, jumped, headbutted something, and chewed a can. 




 Tucked away in an attic? 




 Thanks those are everything I have now, but I sorta have a plan but its a long one. 




 I used too have maybe twice as much including 360 games, NES, Snes, and maybe a few more ps2 games (Metal Gear, Xenosaga, Dragon Warror). I miss it but oh well.  









 I cant wait it looks promising, also I just posted something about this a few days ago some new gameplay and a new interview. I'm not saying its gonna be as good as two as it clams but i am still very excited. 














 Have an upvote sir, for a good cause. 




 I used too live in PA as a child and for a field trip one year we went to Gettysburg, i remember seeing a few buildings one with a hole through the front wall and back of the house and tons of other interesting things. at some point I do remember the guide saying something alone the lines of "The whole area has always had very high sightings of ghost and other unexplained things."  




 To clarify hes doing a NES marathon. 









 No one will even know I was there. 




 Epona is also fed up with that shit.
 




 So here the story im flat broke as of yesterday, I live on my own with my daughter so most of my check goes to her (she has tons of food because of WIC) and I rely on my food card too get me between checks. But I cant go shopping for food until around the 3rd, when my card refills. So im pretty screwed on having dinner. :( Sadly i have nothing to give in return but all my internets.
Im in Licking County, OH
