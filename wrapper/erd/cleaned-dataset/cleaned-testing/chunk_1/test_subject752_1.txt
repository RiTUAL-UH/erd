 Go with the Samsung, their Samsung SSD Magician software taks the guess work out of configuring the OS to best suit your SSD. 














 And for the record the SR71 flew at such a stupendously high altitude there was no chance of a collision. 




 As I said, I'm over you. 
You're probably feeling like a great keyboard warrior, but really you're coming across like a massive douchebag. 




 I'm actually over you. 




 Couldn't agree more.

If you ever get the opportunity to see one either fly or up close, take it, they're majestic beasts. 




 [edited]

Look, my point was if there was an unfortunate series of events, the TCAS is the last hope to avoid a collision. 

Without their transponder operational, TCAS is useless.

I'm not saying they ever got close enough to cause this, or ever intended to but having their transponder off in such an environment (around civvie aircraft) is reckless, surely you could agree to that. 




 [edit]

TCAS has and will continue to saves lives should the absolute worst happen, and while the Russians may be stellar points, murphy's law dictates everyone can fuck up, and having your transponder on can avoid turning a mistake into anything worse. 




 It was humungous. I saw it fly, it almost appears to hover in mid-air. 




 5 foot 7 inches = 67inches.
According to Ask.com the average Banana is around 8inches,
So I'm 8 banana's tall. 









 Ah, sorry I misunderstood. They had to blow it out of proportion for a good media show!  




 The point is they required flights to be diverted away, which means they were enough of a threat -close enough to to an air corridor to warrant be a threat.

Of course you *can* fly without a transponder anywhere in the world, however if you're going to do it next to/around a busy commercial air corridor expect trouble.. 




 A plus 1 for you Sir. 




 The reason they had to be escorted away immediately is because the world has a very effective and proven collision avoidance system, but but it relies on an active [transponder](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision_avoidance_system) which the douchebags had turned off. 

Do you really think this would have been so funny if a commercial airliner collided with one of these guys because that was a real possibility.

You can't just fly in international airspace without your transponder on, that is just incredibly arrogant and puts lives at risk. 

Of course they knew this was going to happen the moment they flew into commercial airspace. 

For fucks sake why are they risking an international disaster by bringing down an airliner in a mid air collision while the world is itching for an excuse to start WW3? 




 Petrol starts to naturally break down, and only lasts a few months once it's been processed. 
So these movies with cars a few years after the worlds petrol distilleries would have been shut down are just impossible, unless they are distilling the oil - petrols themselves.

This will let you see what is keeping your phone awake as there may be an errant application keeping your phone awake. (I know this is unlikely as your issue has already been potentially identified as a signal error, but it's still a very handy app if you have any further battery issues. :) )

 Thanks sylon, I forgot to mention I use the recovery console to clear cache relatively frequently, I use opera which is a cache monster!  




 Ok, this has happened 3 times now so I know it can't be just me. this is irregardless of power saving, screen brightness and there are no errant wakelocks (using Wakelock Detector via PC Developer mode as not support by KitKat.)

Brand new phone stats:
   
***Brand new Samsung S4 i9506***

    4 hours Screen-On-Time, 12+ hours standby.

***Battery life at 6 months:***
    
    2 hours SOT -8 hours standby.
    
***Did a factory reset:***
   
    4 hours SOT 12 hours awake.

***3 months later:***
        
    2 hours SOT, 8 hours standby.

***Another factory reset:***
   
    4 hours SOT, 12 hours+ standby.

***3 months ago now:***
   
    2 hours SOT, -8 hours standby.   

***Last weekend back again:***

    4 hours SOT, 12 hours+ standby

TL:DR battery life is significantly enhanced by a factory reset even if same Apps are installed immediately afterwards. Why is this? 














 I agree. And point taken.

 I only get 30 minutes for lunch, and you need your oven around 180-200 which takes longer than 5 minutes that's just not always a feasible option!

1 minute boil the jug.
2 minutes in the microwave.
3 minutes = delicious pizza.

10 minutes to heat oven up to 200degC.
10 minutes to heat up pizza.
20 minutes = wolf down hot pizza while scarpering out the door! 









 I've just freshly installed it into chrome, thank you for suggesting it. I couldn't agree more about the devs implementing it, would result in less edits, and more intelligible posts. 




 Thank you, I'll install RES as indicated above. 
However for people who don't/can't use Chrome I feel it would be a well used feature, and can't fathom why it's not included. 




 Ah, thank you will install on my Desktop.

Although I use Opera mobile when browsing and posting on the go (so most of the time) so having a feature which isn't browser dependent would be nice. 
I mean other forums I frequent have one, I can't understand why Reddit doesn't. 




 This would help people to see the formatting of their paragraphs etc, and ensure they've used the hyperlink function correctly. 




 No, 2 reasons why I think not:
1- when you have testers in the field you're introducing the human element, and exposing it to be be seen by eagle eyed enthusiasts. Or just simply left in your local pub.. (e.g.infamous iPhone debacle)

2- If you want something released for public consumption it needs to be certified, and with certification companies releasing their records almost immediately. (E.g htc One camera leaked.) 




 I tried this with my s4 but it really didn't like it, crashed and froze often. Settled on dailyroads voyager. Been happy since. 




 I use [DailyRoads voyager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dailyroads.v hl=en) for my poor man's dash cam equivalent (coupled with a windshield mount for my phone.)

Works well, has a multitude of options, including turning audio on/off and had a widget so can run in background, allowing you to play spotify etc.

 Thanks, I searched and something something similar. I'll ask /AskReddit/. 
























 None of those have accurate localised reporting for the smaller villages (like Hamner).

 Exactly, sometimes it's when they trip up and don't use encryption becomes the break in the case investigators use to unravel the rest.. 









 Can we all just realise not just terrorists use encryption? 
If I'm using the internet and my credit card, I want that to be encrypted without a damn back door!  
Or how about secrets that could get to killed if the wrong person knew? 
Or companies transferring information that could bring down corporations.

If back doors exists they are a weakness, which can be exploited and will be by both governments and whoever is either smart or lucky enough to stumble upon it.

In short fuck off, leave us alone and stop treating everyone like damn terrorists, cause that's working so well for you so far ay?


 




 Thanks :-) I think it's mostly to do with the fact Google can't be arsed getting the rights to have that stuff available to nz.  




 That's great and all but fuck Google sideways with a deep heat covered broom stick, they never give out free movies to kiwis like this. (Yes we missed out of the big free for all which affected every other fucking country before Christmas.)  




 But to each, plastic and colored metal scratch and fade over time, exposing the raw material beneath. For leather is intended to have this happen, man made materials are not built or designed with this in mind. 




 Stuff garish gold and silver trims, that leather looks stunning. 




 Ah, thank you that makes sense.

In nz we just have (for panadol) "take 2x 200mg tablets every 4 hours" for instance. It's been like that for 10+ years. 














 I concur!  




 Well, I think the info should be there, but in the same breath I've never understood why there's a sex offenders register, but no murderers register? I would rather know if my neighbor killed his last neighbor personally than if he/she had charged with sex offences.. 




 For instance most acetaminophen and ibuprofen are measured in 200mg and 100mg tablets here in nz, but as I understand the recommended dosage would only work for "most people" based on average weight, so as nations get fatter, won't average pills have to increase too?  




 Yeah!  




 Yeah, not my strong point.  














 Oh my god yes. Likewise just after sex and (if you're uncircumcised) foreskin is like lulwut did I just do?  




 How high are you? 




 That blows dude. 




 Thank you for giving me the tingles. Good feeling. 




 Gently scratch the contacts on your SIM card and expose the shiny metal. Do this very gently.

 "We launched Spotify Connect because we believe that by owning the technology end-to-end, we can deliver the best connected home music."

 It was firmly tongue in cheek.. Geez, sarcasm doesn't translate well in Reddit it would appear.

 MRW reading this post:
Ah, got to keep up appearances I see. 









 Thank you for correcting me, I have always thought that Jade was Chinese, and Greenstone/Pounamu was exclusively nz! 




 A love of coffee. We have some of the best coffee in the world, especially if you like milk, ask for a "flat white" (If you don't know what it is already).

A bottle of our national energy drink - "V" (literally just V.)

anything possum fur related, possum's decimate our native forests, and one of the biggest forms of population control is culling for pelts, so you're supporting our native forests in a round about way.

Ugg boots made with Kiwi sheeps skin are extremely comfortable.

Enjoy your stay!  




 Maori tradition says it is bad luck to buy pounamu for yourself so make sure you have someone there to purchase it for you. :) 




 Proper green stone jewelry, an appalling amount (especially the stuff in the tourist shops) is actually cheap Chinese jade.

If you want proper Greenstone rock on over to the Westcoast. Any reputable seller will happily tell you where it's from.

Be prepared to fork out a bit for it though, proper greenstone can be quite expensive due to Ngai Tahu's exclusive rights to sell it. 




 The ironic thing is if I could afford to give you gold I would.

 Mangos Increase, Strengthen, And Even Lengthen The Euphoric Feelings Felt After Smoking Marijuana

 Ah I see. I'll report that then. App dev's aught to be paid for their hard work.
Also Reddit post says:
"submitted 19 hours ago by [deleted]" hence why I thought your account was deleted! Odd. 




 My point was (however ineloquently stated) why should we report it, you need a valid reason. Just saying "an app for piracy" is useless without a context, like maybe this dude had his app stolen? 

Secondly don't link to it with the main header, as that just piques your interest into downloading it, which rather defies the original purpose of the post. 

That makes me think this was thinly veiled (and rather shameless) advertising. 

But then that probably explains why the dude's deleted his account. 




 And you've now advertised it. No offence but what do you want /r/androidapps to do about it?  




 This: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamucil
Every day man! :-) 









 Well I can thank you for putting me right. 
I strive to make at least semi educated comments, and it's become apparent I have missed the mark here somewhat. Consider me enlightened. :-) 




 I respect what you're saying, but as a layman I have only my opinions based upon reported isolated incidents- articles like this? And other stories brought to me by the media. 
I only know what I read on the internet, and (as with most subjects) what the media portrays. 

Based upon the above my comment still stands however based upon my opinion formed. 

As you're educated on the subject I understand where you're coming from and it must be frustrating to read comments like mine, but let's be honest here, it's not likely to change as the media aren't going to change how they report things of this nature - e.g. "anticorruption measure" stories will get buried amongst stories about corrupt officials each and every time, so can you blame me?  




 I'm saying the country as a whole is very average - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_India

"..But many analysts believe India's sprawling bureaucracy and weak institutionsthe police and judiciary were ranked as the second and third most corrupt institutions in India, respectively, after political partieshave thwarted convictions, and arguably increased incentives for bribery. In recent years, graft pervaded society from small-scale "harassment bribes" (payments for essential social services) to scandals on a national level. At least 42 percent of young Indians have paid a bribe, according to a 2012 Hindustan survey"
[source](http://www.cfr.org/corruption-and-bribery/governance-india-corruption/p31823)

And I specifically refer to the corrupt judge's trial - http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bribery-charges-trial-against-judge-may-finally-begin/article4978237.ece

And now this, which the high court has thrown out as clearly some very dodgy motions were passed without due diligence. 




 Just got home, baby is in bed, I'm on Reddit to unwind after a bloody long day! I'm a kiwi so 7.30pm here!  :-) 














 The night mode didn't adjust for 'night mode' at all. Then I went into my default Samsung camera, selected Night Mode, then hopped out and back into 'a better camera' and voila - night mode activated.

Also flicking between front and back screens causes the camera to freeze for around 2 seconds.

Also changing to and from Video - camera mode causes screen to freeze, need to escape it and get back in.

And HD video quality is piss poor when pixel peeping vs stock Samsung S4.

On the PLUS side, takes very nice HDR photos. 




 Anyone else reminded of the Simpsons episode where Homer got morbidly obese to get out of work?

 Different strokes really. 
I think that's a pretty arrogant thing to say given they target completely different audiences. 
I know there are a few features I love on my Samsung phone my Mate really misses in his CM driven OnePlus. 




 Can we stop and just realize for a minute that you're using a *cellphone camera* to capture a starry night.. 

..Capturing fucking **starlight** on a motherfucking camera phone.

 




 Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you my Prime Minister.. 




 I found Opera crashed frequently, but that was a few months ago I last tried it.

To be honest my phone didn't feel "right" after installing it, Apps were a bit slow to respond, and crashed infrequently, but often enough to make me uninstall, and everything went back to normal.  




 Thank you kindly good sir.

Edit: Actually it is a much better low-light camera than the standard App, (Samsung S4) as it focuses better, and with the HDR mode always on, offers an advantage over the HDR mode over the Stock S4 camera as HDR has to be selected everytime, through a rather clunky menu. 

Very good, and hell, it's free so always a worth a shot! 




 Perhaps forgive my ignorance, but why not take the SIM card out and put it into your phone? The contacts may be old, but could still have "mum"or "dad". 




 For those in NZ - TVNZ's Android App.

Steaming pile of buggy, laggy, useless shit.
They update it about once every 6 months, it crashes around once every 20 minute episode and it takes forever to buffer/load your programs. 




 With Wakelock detector, Facebook and Facebook Messenger each wake up my device around 600 times (!!) in a given day to check for news.

My battery life has increased significantly since I removed messenger, and just don't get messages until I'm at a PC. 

For a casual user bloody pathetic and small minded for them to "Save me a few seconds". I'm not even kidding, Mark - suckerdick honestly told people he cut out Messenger into its own App so save a few seconds when checking/reading messages.

 Zombie Gunship.

Takes up 92MB on a Samsung S4.
Very light on the battery life. 
Very easy to use/learn but hard to master.
Each "game" only takes around 4-5 minutes.

What I especially like is the ability to pause in game, and in the case of my S4, I can leave it running in the background and send a txt message, and then using task manager go back to my paused game.

 This is prettty stupid way of testing your speed, quite a few ISP's actually cache frequently downloaded information, such as Origin or Steam downloads. They pay less as they host the data locally, and it means you download at really good speeds.
