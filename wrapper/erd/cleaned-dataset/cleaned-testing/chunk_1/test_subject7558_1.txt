 I have always gotten auditory hallucinations when I'm falling asleep, whether I'm sober, on kratom or on dope. Sometimes they startle me lol. But that's how I know I'm finally falling asleep. 




 I think you meant to reply to the comment above me. But yeah, I agree. HS is the shit. 




 Where do you go? 




 TIL Valium grows in the ground. 




 I went to the optometrist after a 4 day crank bender one time. He says to me, he says "Holy cow! Your pupils are huge! I don't even need to use the dilation solution!". So I says to him, I says "Yeah, I forgot to take my Klonopin this morning!". And so he says to me, he says "Oh. OK." Afterward I went out to my Jeep and my buddy (who was waiting in the car) has my hood popped and all my doors open, scouring the whip with a washcloth. I says to him, I says "God damn Robby, you hit the shit again, didn't ya?" And he says to me, he says "Yup. You were taking forever". 

I was only in there for like 20 minutes. That brother got issues. 




 I had the same problem for a long time. Now I chase every burn with a half a glass of ginger ale and I don't have the problem anymore. 




 HS for sure. I go 2:1 RVS to Bali. I buy 50 bucks worth total (shipped) and it lasts me around 10-14 days. Obviously I still have 50% of the Bali left after the RVS is gone, so then I go $25 on just the RVS to get me through the next 10-14 days. 




 It's... somethin special. Got me ready to take on the day today, boy. 




 But if I had to choose 1, it'd be Bali. Red Vein Sumatran doesn't do too much for me by itself. 




 I actually combine RVS and Bali 2:1 for every dose. It's the fucking best, ever. 




 BALLLIIIIIIIII 




 This was a wonderful post.  




 Coffee gives me anxiety, but the last 3 times I drank it, the reaction I got was so bad that there's nothing worth going through that again. Coffee can go fuck itself. I was having like tremors, couldn't even hold my head and eyes straight ahead without my head shaking, hands felt detached, and I just felt like shit. It almost felt like dehydration or something but I POUND water all DAY my nigger so IDK, 




 Wait.... there's kratom on Amazon?
And There's such a thing as a Canadian Amazon? 
 




 Yeah I almost panicked a little when all that happened. I'm comfortable with them and the strains I get from them. Would not like to have to shop around. 




 Fuck yeah 




 I always go Herbal Salvation 




 If you're a hardcore kratom aficionado, you manned that shit down and you liked it. 




 Once I got like 95 Dilaudid 4's and I shot them all with my girlfriend over the course of like 60 hours. I didn't shit for maybe two days, and i didn't think anything of it because I was always doing meth and not shitting a whole lot anyways. Well, on the third day, I suddenly had to shit. It didn't feel crazy or anything, just the normal bowel movement feelings. I went and got on the toilet and I pushed and it felt like the fat end of a bowling pin was trying to squeeze out my asshole. I pushed and pushed and it got just to the point where I couldn't just pull my pants up and get laxative and wait, cuz it was too far out, but at the same time it was still not coming out at all. I tried picking at it, but the way it was shaped it just didn't do any good. After 67 minutes of straight pushing on the toilet, sweatin my balls off, it finally came out. I have never experienced such a relief as I did that day, in that moment. I was so happy, the whole time I was pushing all I could think about were all the times I wasn't constipated that I took for granted. It was really a glorious one. It was shaped like a football and it was easily the widest I've ever had. I almost wanted to weigh it. But yeah so I know what you mean by bein so desperate you want to pick at it. 
 




 Bagel with cream cheese for breakfast, random meals with meat for lunch and usually either ham or turkey sandwiches on rye bread for dinner. Some bowls of granola cereal thrown in here and there. I drink probably 3 liters of water a day. No coffee. Do drink juice. Just copped magnesium citrate and stool softener. 




 Shut the fuck up 




 I got some. Thanks. 




 It would but it gives me wicked anxiety so I don't drink it. Sucks cuz I love it. 




 Well. I can eat Bali all day and not get bound up at all. But as soon as the Sumatran comes into play, I'm bound up. So I'm not thinkin it's so much the plant matter as it is just the effects of a certain strain... For me, anyways. 




 I bought some magnesium citrate caps and some stool softener without the stimulant laxative. I'm gonna use both the magnesium and the stool softener for now and see if I can clean myself out a little and then I'll see if just the magnesium does the trick. Thanks for the input. 




 I take Green Bali and Red Vein Sumatran twice a day, about 6-8 grams total. The Bali doesn't block me up, but the Sumatran does. Most of the time I manage to squeeze one or two small bowel movements a day, but it's common for me to go a few days without having one. It always comes around the third day, but this is obviously not a comfortable schedule. What does everybody recommend to take in order to regulate my bowl movements? I have no plans of dropping the kratom as a whole, or the Red Vein Sumatran, for that matter. 




 P.S.  your user name is awesome 




 This thread is retarded. This is the type of shit you don't want lawmakers to see. 




 What strain(s) do you use? 




 I go 2-3 grams of Red Vein Sumatran to 1-1.5 grams of Green Bali chased with a little ginger ale to (successfully) counteract nausea. I do it at 7 am and then again around 5-6 pm. I think your best way of cutting back would be to stop cold turkey for a few days and then continue at a lower dose, because lowering your dose without clearing your system out might lead to disappointing effect.

I love kratom. It's the shit. 




 Just toss it in a little bit of applesauce and then you can swallow it whole. That's what I used to do with shrooms. But I would try to keep the amount of applesauce as minimal as possible. 




 I would just take some on the flight but I would also send some through the mail to your destination in case they take it on the flight. 




 I feel like you maybe ought to tackle one thing at a time. That's what counselors suggest and I can see why they do... like maybe start taking kratom first in lieu of alcohol, since I'm pretty sure that's probably your biggest problem. After a few months of stability, then you should try substitution for the caffeine and nicotine. 

That's just my opinion. I understand why they tell you to do it that way... quitting alcohol, cigs and caffeine all at once seems like it could possibly be disastrous before long. Then again, kratom does some wonderful things. Just my 2 cents. 




 I smoked weed for a few years and then got hooked on opiates. I did them both together for a long time, but then whenever I would smoke weed without being high on opiates, I would get absolutely horrible anxiety. I just ended up quitting weed completely, because it doesn't appeal to me any more... but that sounds kinda the same as you're experiencing. 




 WHO IS THIS FUCKIN GUY 




 Maeng Da makes me feel like I'm gonna die. I go two parts Red Vein Sumatran to one part Green Bali.. about 3-4 grams. It's super excellent. 




 Have some ginger ale on hand in case of nausea. 




 Yeah usually I don't bother responding to articles like that but it put me over the edge when he recommended a benzo. I also just couldn't believe all the comments absolutely bashing kratom. People abuse it in order to get high and then are somehow surprised it becomes a problem for them. I don't use it because I want to get high, I use it because I want to stay sober.

Congratulations on your clean time. 




 I chase every burn with a few gulps of ginger ale. I thought it was stupid when I first heard about it, but I tried it the first time and my nausea instantly was gone. Haven't gotten nauseous since. 




 Eastern US time. New to PS4 and BF4. 

PSN: crfw

Do have mic. 




 fuck yeah 




 I get it from Herbal Salvation. I get the Green Bali and the Red Vein Sumatran. I take it 2 parts RVS to 1 part Green Bali. I always dose the exact same amount and my tolerance hasn't changed.... but I've also learned to appreciate the subtle effects, I don't go into it looking to get blasted... although my morning one is always stupendous. 




 me too. 

psn: crfw

just got it and i don't even know anybody who owns a ps4 lol. i only play bf4. 




 There's so many nightmare-ish comments about kratom on that page that it's hard to believe they aren't loaded comments.  




 Pffffft. Swishing krat around my mouth is half the fun. It just wouldn't be the same if I went with caps. 




 Whoops. My apologies. 




 I've never even heard of this. 2 micrograms seems like a very small amount, since there's 2 milligrams in an 8 mg suboxone strip and that's hardly even really active at an oral dose. Wouldn't taking any amount of nalaxone with opiates just offset the opiate's affinity for the opiate receptors , so taking a small dose of nalaxone would be like taking a little less oxycodone than you actually ingested? Are you supposed to still feel the effects of the oxycodone when you make this combo, and still have your tolerance lowered at the same time? Confusing stuff. 




 Never mind. I'm sure it is. 




 Is it legal for me to sell it to somebody? 




 You scare me by taking 12-14g of Bali. 




 Bali and Maeng Da are really at opposite ends of the effects spectrum. If you liked the Bali then you should be looking into the more sedating strains. I personally combine Bali and Red Vein Sumatran, but I have 100 G's of Maeng Da just sitting here because I tried it and I hated it. Makes me all jittery and fuckin like twitchy and light headed and fucks with my muscles. Not fun. 




 So I got up today and dropped about 4.5 g of the green bali... 3 hours later I was at lunch with my family and the nausea was still bad enough that I didn't even wanna eat. I remembered you mentioned ginger ale, so I ordered some and bam.. gone instantly. I went to the store and copped some 2 liters and came back here for the second dose of the day with a ginger ale chaser and it's all fuckin good. Thanks a lot man (or woman). 




 I don't need to justify it. I shot heroin for 8 years and now I only do kratom. I think that says it all. 




 K, I literally just went and ordered 100 g's of Red Vein Sumatran from HS. Hopefully that solves the problem for me. Thanks. 




 The strain I use is actually Green Bali, it's the only one I've tried that I like... although the one I'm trying next is red vein Sumatran. I was told it's similar to Bali. 




 Tossing and washing literally does not even bother me. I could toss a spoon-full in my mouth dry and chew on it and throw some water in and swish it around and chew some more and just swallow it and it wouldn't even faze me. I'm 100% positive the nausea isn't from the tossing and washing. It may be from the powder itself in my stomach, maybe I need to use a tea, but if that's the case the capsules won't help anyway.  




 Really? You take it on a full stomach to prevent nausea? It works? 




 Sometimes I get nausea on a dose i barely even feel. 




 Alright, I'll give it a go. Thanks a lot. 




 Where from? I have anxiety too and I can't deal with anything speedy. 




 A vicious liquid? Is that like sulfuric acid or something? That stuff seems pretty vicious. 




 Do you mean the green bali from HS does that to you or all green bali does that to you? 




 Honestly, if I wasn't a recovering opiate addict, I'm not even sure I would notice the effects of kratom. They can be so subtle sometimes and I think people often think it's going to hit them like a ton of bricks.  




 THAT BROTHER WRECKED 




 I've been going with MmmS but i recently put in an order to HS after seeing all the glowing reports concerning HS on here. The estimated delivery was supposed to be today, but it hasn't even made it out of Idaho yet. WTF! Again, it's USPS's fault, not HS... it just sucks cuz I'm really looking forward to it lol. Hopefully it gets straightened out before I run out of my current supply. 




 I'LL BE BACK ON THE DIRTY D IN NO TIME
