 Django Unchained
Hobbit 2 
Interstellar 
Wolf of Wall Street
Avengers 2
Dark Knight
Dark Knight Rises
Inception 

those are the ones i can think of 




 The least best film of the series. I didn't think it was terribly awful but not particularly good 
They should have ended at Shrek 2  




 Doc Brown and Django in A Million Ways to Die in the West. (wouldn't say they're my favorite but recent good ones) 
 









 E.T, Jaws, Gremlins (?), Lion King, Forrest Gump (sort of)

just never got around to seeing them :/

 




 Hobbit 1 (64%) and Hobbit 3 (61%) - i like them a lot and think they're hated on too much IMO. 

same with Quantum of Solace (65%)  




 Space Jam 




 oh right, thanks a lot!  




 I'm trying to play all heists in order to get the $1mill bonus so i can buy a hydra. i started playing them and then my WIFI was disconnected for 8 weeks and now im finally carrying on with them. Due to the length of time i havent played, will this affect my chances of getting the bonus? Probably an obvious answer but i need to know.
