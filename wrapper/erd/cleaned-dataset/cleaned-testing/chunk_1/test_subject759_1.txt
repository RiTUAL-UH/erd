 Is that just, like.. A big bowl of meat?? 




 At first I wasn't sure about this compilation but by the end of course I had tears in my eyes. A unique version of a "Most Heartwarming/Heartbreaking Photos" collection, I thought it was pretty touching. 




 Mind over matter; what a crazy wild thing! 




 I LOVED this book when I was little and currently still love it. I found it again at a yard sale last year and all my positive childhood memories came rushing back!  




 Seconded: go see a doctor and they'll give you the answers to these questions but seriously dude this is not an area to take any medical chances with in my opinion.

 Lemons; some full and some cut in half. The full ones can be thrown at people and the cut in half ones can be squeezed into peoples eyes mwahahaha! You walk in with your lemons, attack anyone who gets in your way, blind everyone with lemon juice, and walk out with the diamonds!

Edit: oops got caught up in the fantasy and forgot it was a has station. So instead you walk out with the CASH and CANDY!! 




 This is the perfect type of question to ask the people over at r/outoftheloop :)

 We can't stop here; this is bat country!
