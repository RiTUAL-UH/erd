 you get a pack of 5 cards no matter what your record is in arena, unless I am misunderstanding you 




 Since you get 5 cards minimum per arena, obviously a terrible idea 




 Hmm, that is something I didn't know, and you are right, certainly has a very large impact on results.

I'd like to see Blizzard eventually implement a mode with 2 out of 3s, and a 5-8 card sideboard only for games 2 and 3. 




 23 total decks from 6 tourneys (11/2, 11/3,  11/9, 11/10, 11/16, 11/17). One tourney only reported top 3 decks, the rest had top 4. One tourney had 2 decklists for one place(switched mid tourney or sideboarded into, not sure), so I counted them as worth half each.

* Rogue - 37% (8.5 decks)
* Warlock - 22% (5 decks)
* Paladin - 13% (3 decks)
* Druid - 13% (3 decks)
* Mage - 11% (2.5 decks)
* Priest - 4% (1 deck)
* Hunter, Shaman, Warrior - 0%

Yes, the meta is undergoing a lot of changes and it's a relatively small sample size, but the player quality is likely high and the tournaments are large. I thought it provided an interesting view into the current metagame. 




 rogues, warlocks, paladins, OTK hunters, shamans, mages. I guess "paper" is pretty broad 




 no, it's just conjecture, plain and simple 




 entering for my bro, thanks 




 deal dmg, usually means deal one damage, usually from an ability 




 super wrong 




 They could try and make something like [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=217992) from MtG, but they'd need to test it pretty heavily as this mechanic would be very, very good in Hearthstone. 




 This game is not Magic the Gathering. Rather than countering cards you need to predict what they'll play and lure out their good cards like flamestrike and mind control so they don't get great value out of them. 




 Rogue actually. Love playing priests, they are essentially free wins. 




 obviously not if everyone is still complaining 




 Always good to see lower ranked play determining what's balanced or not...   :\ 




 You mean you actually have to strategically lure out their removal rather than just slamming legendaries? How boring... 




 And it's true because Jimbo727 says so 




 Priests do not need a nerf, they are not good in the first place. 




 Priests are this game's control deck, OTK Hunters are this game's combo deck. Looking at tournament results and hearing opinions from top players, neither of these heroes are very good at the moment in comparison to some of the top classes.

Crying to nerf or change a class that isn't very good in the first place is crazy. Hearthstone needs variety in playstyles. Cutting the control and combo elements from a game is a horrible idea, and just devolves the game into an all aggro deck fest where who can curve out the best wins.

Maybe control or combo isn't fun for you, but playing aggro vs. aggro every match doesn't sound very fun to me. 




 I mean, maybe you still use mind control, I'm not sure. It's just so slow and against a lot of decks the best thing you can steal is like a 4/5, and then you just get smashed and die. The 5+ SW I think is at best a one-of, and probably fine not playing it at all.

I used to play priest and switched to rogue, it just seems like as the meta gets more aggro there are fewer and fewer good matchups for priest. 




 Or you could just buy a game that actually values your time in the first place 




 priests are generally junk now, they are like free wins for a good amount of the very popular deck builds out there. Mind control is pretty bad as a lot of games are decided by turn 8, SW:P is junk maindeck, etc...switch up to something that counters aggro builds like circle of healing/auchenai, or just play a new hero 




 not bad on an acolyte of pain or loot hoarder either 




 entering for my bro, thanks 




 psh that's how I play 90% of the time and I still rattle off 7+ on the reg son 




 Spelunky is great, lots of replay value with daily challenge runs. My personal favorite buy of the year. Rogue Legacy is also good but there's no multiplayer and I have invested a lot less time in it than Spelunky, which I'm still playing for short periods daily. Haven't tried Risk of Rain yet 




 Just temper your expectations, he was good last week but he's been pretty dogshit since taking over for Daniels. The Jax matchup this week is a plus though 




 Says the guy whining about how he sucks at arena 




 That's why top players have around 80% arena winrates, right? They must be soooo lucky. Only scrubs complain about rng/luck 




 Because it isn't luck 




 he's not fixed 




 What makes it the best? I haven't heard of it, playing Hearthstone mainly right now. I have Solforge as well but there's nothing to do in that game 




 I don't think there's a way to drop cards into your lap in hearthstone though 




 posting for my brother who would greatly appreciate one 




 Priests have never been OP in my opinion, they're just the most swingy class and people get pissed when you mind control them to flip the advantage in a game.

They're a class I've even taken to avoiding in arena due to me getting much better results with others, the class heavily relying on picking up mind controls and a few other choice cards, and being very weak to 4 power swarm decks that can survive a turn 5 holy nova. 




 Ah, gaming culture. The only time reviews are taken as truth, and aren't done by "paid shills" or are just "clickbait", is when it's a franchise the majority wants to see do well 




 I'm on the fence. I've heard great things about Expeditions, but I wish it wasn't a flat 6 bucks, especially when nothing else is really of interest to me. I think this is the cheapest E:C has been though, and I doubt it gets any lower than 5 bucks during winter sale (75% off). 




  For whatever reason the #3 receiver in Miami is the #1 receiver.

It's because they're the slot receivers, and Miami's embarrassing O line basically forces Tannehill to throw it to the short yardage guy nearly every play

 




 Nobody is saying a tier list lets you rattle off 9-0s, but it will probably at least help out this 0-3 guy, at the very least to let him know that certain cards he's been drafting are downright unplayable 




 another mind control whine thread... 




 SylasSlays, arbiter of fun has made his decree 




 Fable 3 is so boring and the worst of the Fables by far. It's an ARPG that is incredibly easy, lacks variety in combat, doesn't really have much in the way of interesting mechanics. The "twist" in the game is so poorly done and feels either not thought out at all or completely unfinished.

I actually liked 1 and 2 to boot. Definitely skip it. 




 shelter is 1$ here along with other bundled games - www.groupees.com/bmx 




 None of them 




 Yes, I'd take the flier on Johnson 




 Ivory 




 does he really though? I'd say it's arguable, he's probably still behind deangleo and tolbert 




 I definitely wouldn't count on Johnson being a savior, he's pretty much a lottery ticket. Then again, the over/under for points on JStew is probably around 4, so maybe you grab Johnson and hope he breaks loose. I don't think Stewart really helps you this week or ROS 




 according to rotoworld, he is 




 No, Tate is getting the start, and ARI has a tough run D. If it were ROS I'd say yes 




 there will not 




 How can you possibly claim that when you have no idea what the mechanics of the game will be 




 @DavisMattek - Dennis Johnson is the best add in fantasy right now. Foster very, very out, Tate with broken ribs. Make the move.

I wouldn't go crazy dropping guys, but if you have filler on your bench, could be a nice help on your way to/during playoffs 




  No last hitting

I'm sure hardcore MOBA players will hate this and claim to ruin any depth the game will have, but personally I like this change a lot. 

 




 can't wait to feast on noobs in arena 




 Why would you even be concerned about this in an alpha build 




 I wouldn't call Hearthstone "blatantly pay-to-win", especially since arena mode isn't pay to win in the slightest. As for constructed, it's a CCG, what do you expect 




 Is the Gold Edition DLC worthwhile for someone with only the base game? I've heard mixed things about the Head Games DLC, and have been waiting on a purchase since I don't want to ruin the original. As far as I know, there is no way to play just the base game once the DLC is installed. 




 Why do you even need to say it in the first place? 




 Because it's pretty much just rubbing in the loss. Due to only having emoticons, it's hard to tell if your opponent is actually using it as "good match, you played well", or "haha, I win". I don't need to hear well played before my opponent plays his ripped pyroblast or king krush. Just play the damn card and take the win gracefully. 




 Arena is fine, the RNG is what makes it fun. I played a mage deck with 5 blizzards the other day. Other times I pick mage I won't even get a sniff of any board sweep.

Half the fun of playing arena is making shitty pulls work. 




 Saying well played before you actually go through the motions to kill them is definitely rude, yes. 




 They do, it's called magic online. It's still just as expensive though 




 Definitely really strong in arena, but doesn't need a nerf.

He does have a few downsides. Playing arena as a paladin last night, I think I got 2 free wins by hitting him with an Aldor Peacekeeper(humility also works) and leaving him alone. My opponents desperately tried to suicide him, but by the time he died it was far too late... 




 I mean, afterall, f2p is a misnomer because if you really want to enjoy your f2p game it typically is no longer f2p.

I'm enjoying it just fine without having spent anything 




 You can only de cards from expert packs 




 turn 1 sinister strike 




 It sounds like he hasn't even played it 




 Sure, I get that. I'm just not sure why this thread is about how Solforge is so much better than Hearthstone, because simply put, it really isn't right now. 




 I play both, but quite honestly (and probably unpopularly) Hearthstone is much better right now. It seems like this thread is kind of a knee jerk reaction to hating the big mainstream company, or hating a competitor of a game that we love and are invested in.

To clarify - I think they are both interesting, well made base gameplay CCGs, and I don't think that either is more fun or deep than the other. Solforge is really lacking behind Hearthstone in a lot of ways, though -

* Draft. Right now Solforge has nothing, Hearthstone has arena mode fully implemented which is very enjoyable.

* Free rewards. Both games have daily quests/rewards that are easy to complete. Hearthstone however lets you disenchant cards you don't want and allows you to essentially trade in cards for any card in the game. Solforge, you're cracking crappy free packs and crossing your fingers for a rare - maybe hoarding silver, which we have no idea what it can even be used for.

* Pay to win factor. There is a little bit in both games, but this comes back to the fact that in hearthstone you can craft anything, and only have one legendary per deck. A deck that won a recent tourney, I was able to put together in 2 days not buying anything. In Solforge, 3x legendaries seem to be practically required if you want to play something tier 1 - zimus, phoenix, ghox etc.

* Polish. Blizzard clearly has the upper hand here, Hearthstone is extremely polished, looks and feels great. Solforge has server lag, timer issues, crashes when you open packs, etc...

Maybe all of this stuff gets ironed out when Solforge finally releases some updates, but as it stands I'm playing Hearthstone most of the night, then I'll login to play my 3 quick matches in solforge and quit because there's nothing to do in the game right now. 




 The worst are the people who slowroll the timer every turn, period 




 well played 




 I'm fine with leaving that skillless mechanic with mtg. 




 Not really. Priests are pretty weak to strong 4 attack cards. Playing more of those and cutting some of your top end doesn't gimp you against the rest of the field. 

You aren't running an "anti priest deck", you are just metagaming. Look at chanmanv's unleash the hounds deck - it doesnt care about mind control at all, and hey, it's still pretty strong against the rest of the field!

If you want to keep dropping ysera turn 9 and then go to reddit complaining that priests are so op, go ahead, but you aren't working very hard to actually beat them 




 Or, rather than complaining, you could just design your deck to not be weak against mind control? Just a thought. 




 subtle brag 




 onions make me sad - a lot of people don't realize that. 




 It's pretty similar.

Major Differences -

* in mtg you put land in decks, which you can play one a turn. these are essentially mana crystals. In mtg you need to think about how many land you want to put into your deck, as not drawing enough/too many will screw you - in hearthstone you just get the ideal 1 mana crystal per turn.

* In mtg you only declare you are attacking with a creature - the other player can choose to put one of their guys in front, or take the damage himself.

* In mtg you have opportunites to play spells during your opponent's turn.

These are the major differences, obviously there are plenty of other small differences but the basic gameplay is pretty similar otherwise 




 You can store up to 3, you get one per day 




 No, and to my knowledge it never will due to flash limitations. BOI:Rebirth will have controller support.

As an aside, I'm one of the few that plays BOI with controller and j2k and I don't have any problems. I like it a lot more than KB 




 Can somebody give me a quick sales pitch for someone that doesn't know all that much about this game? 




 I don't think that's true for Halloween sale 




 MTG bans cards, invalidating entire deck archetypes and making other cards worthless in the process. Welcome to CCGs! 




 You can't report them, but they clearly need to implement a time bank or something. It's immature children grasping for a way to troll someone in a game where nearly every method has been prevented.

It is incredibly annoying to play against, especially when you only have so much time to play, and end up using 45 minutes of your time because your opponent has no life and nothing better to do. 




 Waiting until the timer runs down to one second every turn isn't strategic, it's just being a dick 




 It's a beta 




 can you start an arena, exit the game before you get your 3 losses, and continue the next day? 














 Looking for a time killer team to add to my other two, nothing serious. It appears Yahoo doesn't have signups for midseason/redraft. Am I just missing it? Any other major sites still have midseason leagues available to join?

* WR: Justin Blackmon, Josh Gordon, Torrey Smith, Keenan Allen, Percy Harvin

* TE: Jermichael Finley

Leaning towards accepting this counter, but wanted to give it a run through you guys first as it's a big one

Edit: Ended up accepting, yahoo eval trade had me as losing so wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything. Thanks guys 














 14 team non ppr 1 QB 2 RB 2WR 1 TE 1 FLEX 1 K 1 DEF

* RB - TRich, SJax, Bush, Hillman
* WR - A. Brown, Austin, Gordon, Blackmon, Britt, Harvin
* TE - Finley
* PK - Bullock
* TD - Oakland (streaming)

Leaning towards doing the trade as I think PIT isn't going to put up a lot of points, I'm worried about my RB depth, and Givens has nice upside for a throw in. If Wilson goose eggs me, I lose my top WR but I can hope Gordon/Blackmon/Harvin fill the void when they each respectively get back. Thanks for your help in advance 




 14 team Standard non PPR. I need to bench one guy, got ravaged last week with Miller and Wilson giving me duds.

2 RB/2 WR/1 FLEX, CJ2K is locked in by default as my RB1, giving me 4 spots for 5 guys.

Which do I bench out of:

WR: Edelman, Austin, Shorts
RB: Wilson, Miller

Thanks 




 I just drafted a 14 team league non-PPR, (1 QB 2 RB 2 WR 1 TE 1 FLEX 1 PK 1 TD), and am projected for a close week 1 matchup - within a point of yahoo projections. My defense is GB, playing SF. I'm not sure if GB has any value making it worth it to hold onto them, or if I should drop them and pick up a highly projected defense this week and each week after.

I'm looking at a few available - 

* WAS vs PHI
* KC vs JAX 
* IND vs OAK
* CLE vs MIA

I also could drop a bench player for a fill-in defense this week - likely Tannehill, but there are very few backup QBs available - Even EJ and Pryor are gone, leaving Geno, Ponder, and Henne/Gabbert as the only active QBs currently available if Tannehill gets scooped up.

My team for reference -

* QB -Andrew Luck, Ryan Tannehill
* RB -Trent Richardson, Steven Jackson, Reggie Bush, Ronnie Hillman
* TE - Jermichael Finley, Dwayne Allen
* WR - Antonio Brown, Miles Austin, Kenny Britt, Josh Gordon, Justin Blackmon
* PK - Randy Bullock
* TD - Green Bay Packers


What do you guys think? 




 I'm new to the game(FE:LH), picked it up during summer sale. I feel I get most of the mechanics but this is bugging me. Just looking to hear if there is a concensus, as once I start to get many hero units, it becomes slightly overwhelming.

- I generally keep a hero unit in each of my cities to defend it. My cities are protected, but my unit never levels up unless the city is heavily attacked, which is very rare. Is this smart, or should I just use basic forces like militias to defend?

- Is it wise to put multiple hero units in one army? Does this cause exp degradation? I generally don't do this, but will often combine heroes if I want to make an assault on a city early (for example in the first scenario, I used my sovereign, jormur the giant, and the giant golem you get from the quest...didn't even initially realize they were hero units)

- Should your heroes all just be wandering and exploring the map? Any other advice?

Thanks in advance.

 I just received a new 3DS with Fire Emblem Awakening for father's day. What games are must haves for the system? A few things to keep in mind, I know noone else with a 3DS so multiplayer centric games like Animal Crossing don't interest me that much. I generally have a broad taste in games, but particularly like:

RPGs, roguelikes, strategy games, metroidvanias, and indie games. I have a huge game backlog, so I don't really need recommendations of mediocre games (Castlevania for example - not sure if it is mediocre or not but the reviews didn't look very favorable.)

Thanks!

 The game looks cool, seems like Robotron 2084 with upgrades and a makeover. Does this play pretty tight for a twinstick shooter? Alternatively, are other games from this dev (Puppy Games) worth looking into? 




 I know literally nothing of the series, or the quality of the ports to PC. Older graphics won't turn me off, but is the gameplay dated? Any insight to the series is appreciated. They're currently on sale 2.50 each, 6.25 for the bundle on steam. 




 My friends and I saw this late one night on VH1, and now I can't find it. It definitely had a music video, but so far searches have gotten me nothing. Thanks 




 Sega game, most likely genesis or sega cd, early 90s - A ship crosses the ocean, the oars move fast to an upbeat tune. The ship is black I believe. The battle system is on a green field and the enemy is on the other side, it's more than one bad guy. And there are red X's and O's. Black dragons were also involved somehow.

Edit: we figured it out, King's Bounty for Genesis
 









 This game is a updated version of a free flash game on adultswim.com, just recently released on steam. The basic idea of the game is that you are a badass ninja who starts on floor 350 of a tower and descends to the bottom, fighting enemies and bosses at set levels as you go down. The game is procedurally generated and has permadeath of sorts (5 health that is upgradable, 2 continues), so the replayability of the game is very high.

The game is challenging without feeling impossible. It is similar to Dark Souls in the way of once you learn aspects of the game, you begin to breeze through parts that were once stopping blocks. The game to me plays like an amalgamation of NES Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man X, Super Meat Boy, and Hotline Miami, with lots of bits of other games sprinkled in.

Each kill increases a rage meter, which gives you temporary invincibility when it's filled, but is always going down. This increases your score as well, so you are encouraged to go quickly. If you've played Hotline Miami and know the feeling when you get into the zen state where everything works out, that is this game at its best when you are destroying enemies left and right, jumping over spike pits, and clearing 100+ floors without taking a hit.

Along with being procedurally generated, there are tons of unlocks to strive to get, and they greatly vary the play experience and increase replayability. There are 10+ different unlockable choices for each weapon of your starting loadout - weapon, ranged weapon, bomb, and magic(4 choices for magic). Getting tired of katana/shurikens? Play through with a whip/axe instead for a Castlevania throwback. You also can unlock various things like increased item limits, item pickups, and cosmetic changes. Probably 100 unlocks in all.

The sound in the game is great, and the visuals are crisp and look great even when you're racing through the levels. This is a game I picked up on a whim and I've found to be an absolute gem. At less than 5 bucks right now, it is definitely a steal, highly recommended. 









 It is currently on sale for 2.50 on steam, but I'm more concerned if it's worth my time than the money, as my time to game is becoming scarce.

I don't know much about the game, but enjoy the rpg/srpg genre. I am cool with old school as well, have played and enjoyed baldurs gate, planescape, avernum, etc, though I play many games from a wide variety of genres. Thanks! 
























 Currently on sale at 50% as a steam flash deal. Curious if I should buy the entire bundle, certain games, or none at all. I'm worried that this is a series that hasn't aged well, but know very little of any of the games. 




 I just picked this game up, and have read a few guides, but there are still a few things I don't understand. I started a new game in Dublin.

One of the first things I did was to create the title of duke of meath once i had the gold. However, I noticed doing so changed my succesion laws from primogeniture to gavelkind, which was annoying as my initial ruler died to illness almost immediately, so I could not change it. Why did the succession laws change?

Secondly, after getting a CB on Kildare, i gathered my armies and attacked. Still not exactly sure how war works. I defeated their main army, and sieged their town. Do I want to press the button that says (paraphrasing) press the attack but risk more casualties? Or do I just sit there and build war score until i get a surrender?

Finally, once i get the surrender, I noticed the guy is still in charge of kildare but it's in my holdings. Should i tax him? Revoke his title? Imprison him? It seemed somewhat counterintuitive to me that the territory i just captured won't be making me any gold. 

Thank you all for taking the time to help me out. 




 Looking for something fun to pass the time - I'm a big gamer, and my wife is no stranger to gaming either, but not as hardcore.

We have been looking for something fun on emulator (nes/snes/genesis), but can't find much that isn't a button mashing beat em up. Next gen suggestions are ok too, as well as pc.

 Hey guys, been out of the game for a while, since around new phyrexia, but I'm a pretty experienced drafter and grinded the PTQ scene a few years. Going to an fnm draft tonight, Any tips on drafting this set? Colors to push/avoid, speed of the set, availability of removal, underrated/overrated cards, and specific synergies would be helpful.

 I have been out of the standard scene for a while - i quit right before caw blade bannings. I'm looking to put together a standard deck, but I'm pretty unsure what to initially build. I have mostly everything I'd need from before new phyrexia, and could likely trade for the rest.

I'm leaning towards UW delver or a controllish build (UB?), but I figure a lot of you could tell me which decks are tier 1-2, which are on the rise/fall, etc. Thanks!
