Example:

Boy: I'm off to school Mom.
Mom: Ok, don't forget to bring a packed lunch.

When it should be like this:

Boy: I'm off to school Mom.
Mom: Don't forget to take a packed lucnh.

If you're talking to someone and you're asking them to take something from where you are to somewhere else the word take should be used. If you're talking to someone and you want them to bring something to your current location the word bring should be used. I don't understand the misuse. 










































































 It just seems logical. So much quicker, plus you don't have to remember/write down your passwords and such. 













































































































































































































































































































































































































































 I'm literally angry with rage right now.

I love Gears of War. Easily the best part about it in my opinion is Horde mode. It's the mode me and my mate spent the most time playing in Gears 2 and Gears 3. Now all of a sudden they've removed for some unknown reason.

And to add insult to injury the game is shipping with only 4 COMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER MAPS!!!!!! Gears 3 shipped with 10 for fuck's sake. I have been lookin gfor ward to this game for so damn long and now my dreams have been dashed against the rocks of bitterness. Sure I'll still play the campaign and a bit of overrun mode and miltuplayer but the main draw is gone.

I know for a fact that if I hadn't pre-ordered this game weeks ago I sure as heel wouldn't be buying it now.

Way to royally fuck things up People Can Fly.

Anyone else disappointed by this news? 
























































































































































































 I personally don't really mind. Most of my games are on disc but I have a couple of dozen games downloaded from Xbox LIVE and PSN. I would probably be sad when the time comes that games no longer come on a physical medium but I will understand that it's been made redundant. 
































































 Please don't downvote people for their opinions, unless they word them in a scumbag kind if way. 

Personally I hate Gangnam Style and Harlem Shake videos. I just genuinely don't see the appeal of either and am befuddled as to why they are so popular. 

Your turn...
