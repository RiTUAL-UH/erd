 WOW...I didn't know that Batman's costume looked that bad. He looks like a chode of some sort TBH 




 I'd give Alan Watts a chance. Check out a video on youtube. He's a modern philosopher like I've never seen before but then again I don't know many philosophers other than Socrates and his pupils 




 Not necessarily, if you eat more then you have to get rid of the waste products that you're body doesn't use and if you eat more then you are bound to have to poop more. So technically, a thinner person can poop more but on average the bigger person will expell more fecal matter. 




 No 




 Oreo is definitely one of the biggest cookie companies in the U.S. There are a ton more (We are capitalist after all) like Chips Ahoy, Mother's cookies, Famous Amous just to name a few. Oh and you probably already know that biscuits=cookies in the states. 




 I want to say no, but he might be that to you so idk 




 Okay??? Just because he had a vice, like us all, doesn't mean his philosophies are not valid.  




 Go listen to Alan Watts and his philosophy on life...Your Welcome. 




 Because the man gave us 'College Dropout' and 'Late Registration'. 




 I'd keep my lights off so that he/she doesn't have an easy time looking inside the house from outside.  




 Not bad at all man. Keep it up! I make [music] (https://soundcloud.com/sonnywane/intoxicated) too! 




 People will always go for easy karma. I for one, think people should boycott reddit gold. 




 If you say moral of the story is to not listen to a redditor's advice but you, a redditor, tell me not to....WTF 




 In PKA 132, Woody claimed to have a MMA fighter guest who fought a chimp lined up. Did he ever follow through getting this guest? I personally don't remember this ever being brought back up. 




 Ohhh. Yeah, she wasn't a very good guest. I remember her saying something like "People come to watch my streams for gameplay" and then I saw her twitter feed...And was like BULLSHIT https://twitter.com/MystikGunn/status/489593547062927361 




 Well, thats a pretty boring answer. Was she asked this before? 




 They've talked about this before but it was a guy who payed something like court fees or maybe a ticket in pennies. Don't know what episode sorry :( 




 I know, Lot of ways you could go with this  




 If I Only Had 24 Hours I Would... 




 Get off your fucking phone in the movie theaters! I don't give half a shit if you so much so desire to snapchat that you are watching Jurassic World, hoping on the inside that your friends are jealous that you are having fun.  




 Thank you so much for this post! 




 I guess you're Australian now mate :) 




 Just...Wow 









 I've put in a ton of work finding samples (mostly on youtube). I was just trying to get some new artists or songs that I might not have heard before! Thanks for the input! 




 Im 16 y/o, I make hiphop instrumentals and whatnot, I am running out of samples and I was wanting a challenge or even just some suggestions. I'd prefer ambient, chillwave, downtempo, soul, disco, or rnb samples, although any suggestion would be great!

Not sure why the link wasn't working in the text. SKIP TO 0:20  









 Not sure if you need a song? but I make beats and if you like it then let me know. https://soundcloud.com/sonnywane/demons 




 I am currently 16 but when I was 14 I was in a similar situation. Try FL Studio's free demo. I used that for a year. Save your projects and export them all you want! You just can't re-open saved projects after closing the program :( 




 Simple Kick on every fourth beat, a oldschool hat, and a clap. Not my genre per-say (  I'm 16) but its just a simple drum loop over a sample. I could re-create it in like 2 minutes. Sorry, but I don't know what exactly you are asking. 




 I'm not an expert, just a 16 y/o hiphop music producer, and I use samples a TON, but I think the situation varies on who you are sampling. If you can get into contact with the creator of the sample source, he/she can give you permission to use the sample for free or they might charge you/want a cut for the use of their artistry. If you're releasing this for monetary gains, usually the label would take care of sample clearance but I'm not sure if thats possibility in your situation or not. 




 What episode was it discussed? I consider myself a PKA Historian but I don't recall when this was discussed. Time stamp would be great, episode number would be good too! 









 I'm no PKA veteran but,my experience is that, Woody pronounces Liam Neeson correctly nearly everytime he attempts to on the show. 




 Can't wait to see how the Punisher is gonna be in Season 2!
