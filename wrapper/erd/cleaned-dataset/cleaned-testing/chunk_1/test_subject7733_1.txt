 valid point, wp rpeet 




 my post was obviously meant to be taken with a grain of salt, I knew pr0lly would never read this 




 I got dumpstered by a Fizz, then bought him as my first champ and dumpstered on other people because of his high burst. Then I began to systematically branch out and tried to pick 1-2 champs for each role. I would experiment on specials champs or I'd play ARAM so i'd be forced to mess around with different champs even though it was still an ARAM. I also began to main Pantheon in the jungle when he was stronger and got quite good with him. So basically I think it comes down to enjoyment. I'm sure you've read about people maining an unpopular champ and getting into diamond or other divisions. So if you pick a champ that you enjoy playing then you should main that in my opinion. 




 There are plenty of good youtube videos directed at new players that will give you a bunch of general knowledge to help you as you learn the game

edit: damn why the downvote :'( 









 Can someone TL;DR pls? lol 




 Nasus is really reliant on farm, more so than any other top laner. The current meta denies cs to the top laner. If it takes about 20-25 minutes for a Solo queue nasus to become relevant with easy farming. It would be too late for nasus in LCS gameplay

 IT'S A DATE

EDIT: DAMN IT 




 I saw this on reddit a couple days ago and I agree. It was a post about how it was embarrassing that the LoL client was so out of date, that 3rd party organizations have created clients that are far superior. 




 You made a lot of good points, and I appreciate you're really thoughtful insight. About your point on buyouts. I wasn't necessarily suggesting a company buyout. We both acknowledge that Riot more or less has a monopoly on the MOBA market, aside from Dota2 being the only competitor which really can be seen as negligible in my opinion. 

You're also right to point out that I was basically asking for LoL with Riot that makes little to no mistakes. I was just trying to think about games I know that have risen to popularity in the gaming scene. My first real experience with the gaming scene was with Halo 2 back around 2007-ish at the beginning of Halo 3.  Halo dipped because of their own shortcomings, but rose to prominence? Call of Duty in the First Person Shooter genre. Which was always in my opinion, a simplified Halo. So I was thinking that simpler is always better for gamers. Whether that be because of people's attention span or something else.  I don't think we'll see a change in the foreseeable future. 




 Good looking girl with some self-respect, but not enough *personality.*
See you on the second page. 




 This is purely a skeptical post to talk about the current state of affairs and *professionalism* of Riot.

I'm not creating this solely because of the recent Korean uproar, but it definitely served as an impetus for me to finally put this out to the community. 

In my personal opinion, I think Riot is setting the stage to be over taken as the world's largest MOBA and competitive gaming scene. Not within the next year or even the next few years, but eventually I think their mishaps will culminate to their downfall. I believe this is because of how they conduct their interactions with the community and how whimsically they conduct the professional scene.

**FIRST**

I will first talk about the community interactions and secondly about the professional scene.

Riot has historically been a company that interacts largely with it's players and with positive results. I don't wish to talk about Riot-to-player interaction because I don't have any problems with the way those situations are handled. But the thing that they fail to do is live up to their promises. These promises include client updates, champion releases, VUs, reworks, etc. Things are promised and aren't really delivered as expected, hence the popular soon^TM when upcoming releases are discussed. To me, this is unprofessional, however, Riot never gives a date or timeframe for their releases which allows them all the flexibility in the world so that they don't back themselves into a corner. This is the general gist of the unprofessionalism without going to much further.

**SECOND**

The second topic was about Riot's conduction of the professional and perhaps the most astounding one to me.  I think Riot aren't doing themselves any favors with the way they reprehensibly plan their events. Most notably:
* Korean *miscommunication* about the location of Worlds
* Treatment of Gambit with the London LCS event
* Replay of LCS game because of Aatrox bug

This is just a short laundry list to exemplify in major ways that Riot is failing it's fanbase and perhaps it's most famous players.

**My thoughts to the problems**

For the first topic, I'm a little bit more forgiving because complications in testing and designing are a necessity when aiming for perfection. However, where is the line drawn with how much leniency Riot gets after they make promises.

The second topic, however, just can't happen in a professional setting. As a major gaming company, you can absolutely not allow these mistakes to happen. Poor planning and unfair treatment of your own teams resonates deeply in me and cannot happen.

**RIOT ISN'T EVIL**

Now this may be completely unfair of me so lets talk about the great things about what Riot has done professionally.

NA   EU LCS are streamed for free in a professional setting, Free game, many compassionate employees that care about making the game better, and **FREE GAME**

**REPLACEMENT?**

Now what would it take to usurp Riot at the top of the totem pole? It simply comes down to money in my opinion. Riot has generated so much money and invested so much money into this scene, that it would take a great sum of money to topple Riot. Dota 2 turns off fans because it is seen as a more complex MOBA that can be unforgiving. LoL holds your hand as your learn, its pretty simplistic and can be learned within a couple weeks. 

So I think it would take a new MOBA that was as simple as LoL to learn, instilled many of the elements that LoL has, and most importantly, can offer **money** to tournament teams as prize money. Money used to advertise the brand and money to pay the best employees with knowledgeable MOBA experience.

**TL;DR**

* Riot doesn't deliver on promises that are generally advertised earlier
* Riot mishandles professional teams and events
* Riot is obviously still a great company, that has obvious room for improvement
* Would take bookoo bucks to usurp Riot


**Again, these are just some general thoughts of mine! I wish to only stimulate conversation and kind of bounce thoughts off the reddit community. Thank you for your time! CRITICISM OF ALL KINDS IS APPRECIATED, TRY TO KEEP IT RESPECTFUL**

 Also for clarification, he wasn't absolutely being forced by the NBA to sell the team. It would go through a vote of owners to decide his fate, but even then would go through countless legal proceedings because the team is his property. And you can't force someone to sell their property, pretty unconstitutional.

 I was in Baltimore once when there was an anime/cosplay thing going on. I couldn't help but feel embarrassed for them as they walked around the city in 90 degree weather looking like jackasses. AND Yes I have tried it, It's called Halloween.

 Thanks guys

 Loco is annoying as fuck 




 The kid he called was 17 I think xD. I couldn't make out all of the conversation, and only caught bits and pieces. I heard something about him being a prince or some shit. There are a lot of pro streamers that don't have quite the popularity as other streamers. So maybe it'd be easier to get an interview with them. 




 Well some dude was just watching Imaqtpie and donated a bunch of money, and then qt got his number and called him. It was pretty tubular so maybe if you have 250 quid lyin around.

 At the beginning of a game once, a Brand ran straight to the mid turret and suicided. Afterwards, everyone was spamming their own versions of "WTF LOL" and after a brief pause. Brand says, "Gotta get them turret hits" Wiser words have never been said.

 I've definitely said some bannable things, but I haven't been chat restricted. Not necessarily raging, more or less I've said things in jest. Essentially my point is, system seems incredibly broken. 




 FINALLY HECARIMJOB! 




 WHERE THE FUCK IS HECARIMJOB? 




 Boring people do boring things. Simple. 




 Just Main Street 




 Is lich bane still the best item to build first on Fizz? Or is there a better item? 




 If the LoL/esports community needs to call on the fans to make a Hall of Fame, then it doesn't deserve one. To have a hall of fame, it requires tradition, this game hasn't been around long enough to prove it deserves something as prestigious as a HoF. Just an opinion.  It should also be created by the governing body (Riot) to preserve the integrity of the Hall. 




 Only word I understood was 'Fuck' 




 If I play mid I always play Fizz if he's open (he's my main). However, I don't know what to build first with the recent Lich Bane changes. Is this still the best item to rush? Another question of mine is, who are the best AP junglers? I'm not good enough to play Elise, Fidd is too situational, and Evelynn is more AD than AP. 




 You're seriously put-off by some champions (a digital character) taunting? Damn dude, would hate to see you get tea-bagged on Halo. You can also keep the pentakill because it's extremely rewarding and badass. I've never seen someone steal a penta then have a teammate ragequit/grief. Why have equal portraits either? This is an extremely soft view you're taking, I'm sorry.

           The only point that I really agree with is the "all chat". Because that is essentially useless in 100% of the cases. There is nothing that you can communicate with the opponent that can help you out. It usually stems from playful joking from 0-1:55, then after that its nothing important from 1:55-end.  




 Heres the tiers in my opinion,    Riot  ESPN  British Football Commentators, those lads are brilliant over there across the pond. 




 RIP headphone users, fuck
 




 Came for the prospect of Iker playing League, left disappointed
 




 I know it's your body and not my decision in the slightest. But come on man, do you really want a LoL champion tattooed, the game probably won't survive 5-10 more years. Commence my down votes. 




 Yeah I'm totally disregarding that comment, athlete sports take a level of intelligence in their own right 




 Seems like the problem lies within riot and not the fans. With the amount of cameras they have, the commentators could announce it remotely in the next room over without missing a beat. I will admit that league does involve a precedent never seen before in sports. This precedent is that live commentary is actually a necessity for the fans. Seems weird to think about goin to a football game and have an analyst over the speaker the entire time. 




 So I'll preface this, like I did in my title, that I'm a long time sports fan before I ever got into e-sports. There is an unusual thing that I'm seeing with the e-sports fans. There seems to be factions forming about how fans should be cheering and other etiquette issues, which is foreign to me. Maybe it's just because I support Philadelphia sports teams that have some of the harshest fans that made me like this. But I say that fans cheering and being loud is all a part of the game and it's the atmosphere that riot should want to generate energy in the building. Now I don't think fans should be able to call out opponents positions or if the other team is baroning. In the real sports world there are unfair conditions, home field advantage, etc that can swing games, but it's a part of the game. Fans do whatever they can, within reason, to help their team win.

TLDR; If you want to accept the popularity of the growing sport and help keep the exciting atmosphere, then accept what real sports atmospheres are really like. 




 I hate cosplay and think it's one of the most awkward things I could ever witness. If I'm ever fortunate to have kids some day, I'd rather walk in on them beating off than have them dressed as a league character and dancing To make a YouTube video. 




 Vel'koz is the Flying Spaghetti Monster, what an awesome skin idea concept! Anyone? 




 CFC CHECLSEA!!! 




 Yet again I can't play Hecarim even once! Rito plox! D: 




 Does that yellow show up on their screen too? 




 Can I just have a quick clarification for Evelynn's stealth? When I'm around my opponent, the eye above them is gold. Does that mean that they know that I'm around, they just don't know where exactly? And when it turns red, it means they can full on see me. I just want to make sure I watch for this as I learn to jungle eve. 




 Yeah this helps, thank you. I know what you mean about the trouble with some mids picking AD assassin champs like a talon or zed. I don't have a very deep jungling champion pool. I keep it to panth, j4, and fidd. I'm still trying to learn eve, but I think Elise might be above my skillcap to use her well.  




 When I'm picking a jungler, is it right for me to want to keep a balance between the AD and AP on my team? So lets just assume that mid is AP, bot is AD with an AP support. If my top picks an AD champ, do i always wanna go with an AP jungler, and vice versa? I realize that it is in a sense situational and it depends on my team comp. I'm just kind of looking for a general rule of thumb for know which junglers to pick, given a team comp. 




 I feel embarrassed that this dude was wearing that in public.
 




 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand another week without Hecarim 




 If it happens in real professional sports, its even more definite to happen for League Of Legends. Since English isn't your first language, this analogy might not be very effective. However, for basketball, Kobe Bryant (Famous  dude) this year was almost voted an All-Star despite being injured for pretty much the entire season and not having any stellar performances. 




 If you check his right ear, ya missed a spot. 




 Riot's own Vitruvian Man 




 What happens when Vel'koz gets The Lantern 




 I feel the exact same way man. It's been well documented that the toxicity of the LoL community is pretty great. I see posts all the time about these issues and it happens to me all the time too. I actually almost considered quitting the game entirely because I was amazed at how selfish most players are. Reminding people to be nice to other people, and remember who is actually behind the computer screen doesn't really work. In theory its great, and practical, but its so easy to be angry. So really the only way to make great environments for playing is for riot to take drastic action, and place all the trolls together. But they've already stated that they won't do that, so don't hold your breath for any changes in the ranked environment any time soon. Essentially the only time I feel like I'm in a relaxed environment is when I'm in normals, and the result of the match doesn't really matter to me. So good luck in trying to get out of bronze and thence forward. :) 




 Ever since I started playing about 7 months ago or so I always saw Hecarim as a badass. However, he hasn't been free since I've started playing and I think 6300IP is too expensive to try him out. Hecarim I want to try you please come out and play! D:  




 Out of the 5 or so best junglers currently in the meta, which have the best level 1-3? And which counter each other so you know whether to invade or not? 




 Why have game modes been playable for a week or so and then removed? Why not give players the options to play a variety of different game modes? Seems interesting that they keep a game mode like dominion, yet neglect game modes that get a lot of traffic. Maybe, there are server issues and it becomes just too hard for Riot to keep all these game modes functioning simultaneously. Does anyone know an actual reason or do they just like to keep things fresh and new? Thanks! 




 Plus his eye is basically an extra pink ward if you look at it. OP 




 Ah, those were all very good points to be made. Especially the time zone one, since I live on the east coast and the time I play before bed, could be the time that someone on the west coast just ate dinner. 




 I was just making an observation and this is in no way a definite truth, but I feel like I win more games during the night time. And this is independent of what day of the week it is. So I began to wonder what the cause might be. Is it that I just am more relaxed and focused to play before I go to sleep? Am I just at an awkward ELO that it's hard for be to be too consistent? Now before I make my main point, I'd like to preface that I'm over 18 years old :P. But could I have a better win percentage because at night I'm more likely to play with other players of my age demographic? Since I wouldn't be playing with younger players, is there a less chance of having ? I realize that this is completely different than the 65-year old trying to text and just being completely confused by a younger generation. But could this age gap with my teammates during the day be causing me to lose more? I also want to point out that I'm not trying to condescend to younger players that are better than me ha. However, is there a point to made? Please let me know if you find this interesting or if I'm just seeing things that aren't there. Thank you.
