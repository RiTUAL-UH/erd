 Well there is certainly no rush!  I'm just thrilled that you're working on it.  Can't wait to hear what you've come up with! 




 I love his tummy spot -- perfect for scratching and kisses!  I had a rat as well, who is no longer with us, but rats are awesome! 




 This is my plan B career. 




 Tongue is one of my favorite foods.  This ad makes me wish I could go to the store RIGHT NOW and buy some.  No joke. 




 I cannot upvote this enough.  Huzzah for you! 




 Please do!  Apollo is sitting here with me right now, and it's just so...quiet.  If only there was some sort of song playing... ;) 




 I noticed that too!  I'm guess that since the horse in question was a yearling, they are using the term "pony" incorrectly to mean a young horse.  Do some research people! 




 Oh I do hope it is!  Thank you!!! 




 Thank you GreivisIsGod!  Glad people are getting excited about this.  Maybe I'll get several submissions and Apollo can have different themes depending on his mood. :D 




 Maybe you can team up with someone?  You could do the words and music, and they could sing it for you?  Heck, even if you can't sing well, do it anyway!  Silly songs don't need perfect voices! 




 The dog in question is Apollo, a springer spaniel/golden retriever mix. I often sing to him about his greatness, his beauty, and his strength, but I'm no songwriter, and I think he deserves an anthem of sorts. I know that a song about Apollo would make my boyfriend incredibly happy, so this is a surprise of sorts for him!

First off, here are some photos of Apollo for inspiration: http://pineappleblurt.imgur.com/apollo#38wmp

Now, some Apollo facts:

- I often sing of how he crunches the bones of his enemies, and that he is the destroyer of Tirmok, and had pillaged and burned many villages and thatched roofed cottages.

- Apollo loves the water. He also loves tennis balls, bones, eating, and his eternal love -- our neighbor Deb.

- According to Apollo, no one ever feeds him. Dinner time for him is all the time.

- He was named not for the god Apollo, but for Apollo from Battlestar Galactica.

- He has a superhero alter ego named DarkFart, who fights crime under the cover of darkness.

This doesn't have to be an original melody. Something epic sounding, like the Soviet national anthem, would be incredible. Silly lyrics, about Apollo's unrivaled awesomeness, strength, and beauty, are a must. :D

Forward songwriters! I hope someone accepts my challenge! If I end up with an mp3 of a song all about Apollo, I'll be the happiest girl alive.

Edit: formatting 




 Thanks!  I shall cross post as suggested. 




 That is excellent!  Thanks for the info.  Also, I upvote this not just for the help, but also for the hilarious name of the website. 




 This is so exciting, yokaishingami!  Thank you!

 I have some things!  Most of my shirts are XS or S, and I do have 1 or 2 sized pants and dresses.  Let me raid my closet and see what I can find for you.   




 They are all so cute! 




 How exactly do you get out there? 




 I feel for you.  This March I got some bad sunburn while wearing an earflap hat and large sunglasses.  It looked...interesting. 




 My friend is going to have a boy in August!  She and her husband aren't terribly "in need", but they are grad students, so things aren't all sunshine and lollypops either!  Can you message me your email address and I can put them in contact with you if they are interested?  They aren't Redditors. 




 The Bulldog, either in St. Paul or NE Minneapolis.  Super tater tots too! 




 Thanks for the info you guys!  I didn't have much time to look around while I was at the show, but I did get to the American Saddlebred Museum and the Barn of Champions (got to meet Cigar!).  It was a great show venue and we had a great show!  Check it out: https://www.shaneshifletphoto.com/dspProofImage.asp?width=1210 show=2011%20Bluegrass%20Morgan\Saturday%20Morning\128%20-%20Hunter%20Pleasure%2C%20Ladies%2C%20Championship image=128-061-11BM.JPG
 




 Hmmm...I find this silly. 




 How does 143 mean I love you? 




 Ah!  SQUEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!! 




 Nice outfit, Riblet!  Also, GREAT dog name, knaps! 




 Your daughter is seriously cute.  Cutest kid I've seen in a long time! 




 I hope you guys do this again another time.  I'm out of town this week, but I'd love to bring my dog at some point! 




 Thanks for the info.  I'm going for the Bluegrass Morgan Classic -- I know there are several shows going on at the same time at the Horse Park this weekend.  There is going to be so much to see, and probably not enough time to see it all! 




 I have Morgans too!  Nice to know another Morgan Redditor! 




 I'll be heading down this week to Lexington for a show at the Horse Park.  It's my first time there, and there is so much to see!  I know I won't have lots of time in between showing my horse, so for those of you who have been there, what were your favorite things?  What should I skip?   I'm for sure checking out the Saddlebred museum, and I'd like to see some of the famous horses there. 




 What is the difference between "yellow" and "lemon"? 




 I liked Mirror of Korea ok, but when I ordered the Bibimbap they COOKED THE EGG YOLK ALL THE WAY THROUGH.  The runny yolk is what makes that dish! 




 He is wonderful!  You should crosspost this on r/equus. 




 Are you kidding?  I WOULD LOVE THIS!  Do they make them for big kids? 




 Yeah, I don't live there anymore -- now I'm in Minneapolis.  But I still go back to Roscoe quite often to visit my folks. 




 Sweet!  Roscoe is represented on Reddit!   




 Is that Hononegah high school? 




 NOT a stupid question!  I do mine damp (wet and rung out).  Not sure what would happen if you do it dry...let's not find out. 




 Also related, you can kill all the nasties on a sponge by zapping it in the microwave for 2 minutes.  Careful -- resulting sponge will be hot and steamy. 




 Merrils are awesome!  Another way to take care of your feet while still being frugal is to get a pair of prescription orthodics crafted by a podiatrist.  While the initial investment is pricey ($200?) they last for-freakin-ever (they are made of a material called Superglass, a type of fiberglass).  I got some 10 years ago because I have extremely high arches and it was killing my knees to walk.  Now they go in all the shoes I wear (except heels) and it really don't matter if I buy cheaper shoes that have no arch support (like Converse) because my orthodics are in there.  Any shoes I want, and no knee pain! 




 Shoes.  Buy good shoes.  If you buy crappy shoes you will mess up your feet over time and when you mess up your feet, you mess up the rest of you (knees, hips, back, etc.)  

I buy all my clothes secondhand, but always purchase top quality shoes! 




 Enchilada bake is the best freakin' thing ever.  Get an 8x8 pan and open a can of enchilada sauce.  Put a little bit of sauce in the bottom so things don't stick, and begin layering -- tortilla, black beans, cheese, sauce, tortilla, beans, cheese sauce, etc. until you get to the top of the pan (usually about 3 layers).  Then top it off with any leftover sauce and cheese and throw it in the oven.  350 for...I don't know...25 minutes?  You know, until it's bubbly and hot-looking and done.  

Hella tasty, impossible to mess up, cheap to make, and great for lunches. 




 I am also building credit, and I only use my card for groceries.  Even if I don't put much on it, I'm paying it off in full each month, and therefore build credit.  I have a Chase Sapphire card along with a Chase rewards debit card (I bank with them, but they have credit cards available in general).  Also, the US Bank Flex Perk cards are very highly ranked. 




 D'AWWWWWWW!  Darling!
 




 My dad convinced his secretary that bison dig holes in the ground to live in while they hibernate in the winter.  I convinced this same woman that a local water tower was actually a hot air balloon. 




 Your dog is darling.  What is he/she? 




 I had one of these guys too.  We named him Earl the Squirrel.  I found out upon bringing him to the Wildlife Rehab Center that squirrels of this age (just out of the nest) don't really understand danger and routinely approach people, just like Ruppert did.  Earl did the same to me, hopping onto my foot and looking scared.  You would think squirrels would have evolved a better sense of fear after all these years.  Nevertheless, Earl was super fun to have.  We used to nap on the couch together and watch Jeopardy.   




 Folding myself in half backwards, and other contortionist-like abilities. 




 I've had this all my life but never knew it had a name!  I have asked eye doctors about it, but none of them have ever told me about visual snow.  Makes it incredibly difficult to see at night, especially things like holes in the ground while walking in the dark.  Glad to know it's a real thing, and I'm not just completely insane. 




 Thanks!  Wish this topic would make it to the front page -- I want to see more pictures of people's horses! 




 Guys always laugh when I tell them how sexy I think forearms are, and yet here we are, so many of us loving forearms.  Especially when the guy is wearing a plaid shirt with the sleeves rolled up.  *drool* 




 I'm just finding this thread now, and I'm thrilled there is a subreddit for horses!  Here are my two Morgans, Baby (chestnut) and Rillo (bay).  Baby is Rillo's mom, so it's a family affair when we show!

 Just found this subreddit now!  Some great Saddlebred magazines are:

Saddle and Bridle - http://www.saddleandbridle.com/
The National Horseman - http://www.tnh1865.com/
Saddle Horse Report - http://www.saddlehorsereport.com/

Also, this is a complete list of books written specifically about Saddlebreds: http://www.trot.org/forum/showthread.php?t=2158 however many of these you would have to find used/vintage.

From a fellow Saddlebred lover, I hope this helps!
