 that's way more coherent than what i used as my facebook status update. of course, i was drunk at the time, as that was the only way i could muster up enough courage to hit the "post" button.

that letter pretty much says everything you need to say.  good luck! and of course, if you need to talk, we're always here. 




 nope 




 i'd say both 




 it DID say "early" results 




 nobody said science had to be boring 




 Power density (or volume power density or volume specific power) is the amount of power (time rate of energy transfer) per unit volume.

Supercapacitor power density is typically 10 to 100 times greater than for batteries and can reach values up to 15 kW/kg. 




 i know plenty of trans girls who, when they first come out, go uber ultra femmy femme femme. and then after awhile, slowly drift towards andro. i also kinda hate them because the ones i know look awesome at ANY point of the gender spectrum, boy, girl, AND inbetweeny.  




 when i was first out buying girl clothes, i was so nervous because i thought the sales people would judge me with their judging eyes. but i soon realized that nobody gives a shit. 




 rule of thumb is that the younger you start the better. but, as you get older, the effect of hormones is different from person to person, so YMMV 




 *sigh* that sounds like my dad. way back when, he actually helped his friend transition. but the second i came out, he sed that he "didnt believe that being trans was a real thing" and asked if i had "tried not being trans?" yes, he actually used the x-men question. (no he has never seen the movie)

every time he posts on facebook about me, it starts off with "My son..."

i've been transitioning for almost 3 years. smh 




 no prob, i know it get confusing. 




 The Blade is the oldest LGBT newspaper in the United States and second largest by circulation,  originally launched by a group of volunteers as an independent publication in October 1969. It's  often referred to as America's gay newspaper of record because it chronicled LGBT news locally, nationally, and internationally 




 i didnt know it either, i totally thought they were hard bits of soap too. 




 hell, I didnt know WPATH was based there til i went looking. good luck tho! i totally understand about wanting a female therapist to talk to. i lucked out when i went a'googlin' for mine. i found her a block away.

 yeah, i know they say that they dont require a court order any more, i was sure asked for one at the dmv. the court doesnt keep a record of your gender other than when you file the application for name and/or gender change.

at the DMV, they required the DL-44, which is the application for new license, and a DL 329, which must be completed by a licensed U.S. physician or psychologist.

but in addition,  they required a court order, Form NC-230, to go along with it. 

i dont think they updated their procedure, cuz people at the dmv and SSA were pretty confused. the court order made it way easier. that little piece of paper carries a lot of weight to it.  




 no, i'm a trans girl, who was assigned male at birth. and i like girls, so that makes me a lesbian. sex and gender are two separate things 




 http://t-vox.org/newtvox/medical/therapists

also try maybe finding a trans meetup group in your area, it'll give you an opportunity to go in girlmode. 




 that raises ALL kinds of Nature vs Nurture questions. i'm glad you're happy tho.  




 well, i just changed my name and gender in feb, and you have to go thru the court if you want to change it with the dmv and social security. 




 you're not alone, there are many  others who were or are currently in your situation. i've known a few couples who stayed together, a few who didnt. but i know this, you have to see a therapist. you're tearing yourself apart right now. make the appointment, tell your  wife that you're seeing a therapist to help with your gender identity. if they're a good therapist, bringing your wife along to a few session wouldnt be a bad idea either. i've known some couples to work thru transition together this way. there are many other bridges to cross, but they comes way later down the road. this is the one you have to cross now. 




 it took me about a year before i started seeing the girl look back at me in the mirror. we're often our own worst critic. i think it finally clicked when i was talking to a bank rep on the phone and she gendered me female. it dawned on me that everyone around me was gendering me female, even people on the phone who couldnt see me. i was pretty much a girl in all aspects of of my life. it was only then that i stopped worrying and relaxed enough to actually enjoy this crazy journey. 




 i'm not the one arguing against gravity. 




 ok, first off, i have to start by saying that the only person who can know if you're trans or not is you. if you can, make an appointment with a gender therapist, because they're the best equipped to help you figure out any questions you might have about your gender identity.

that said, i've known i was trans since i was 7, i saw a documentary on a group of trans women prostitutes working to save money for their transition. in my head i knew i could "switch to be a girl!" of course, i spent the next 33 years fighting myself, because just like you i'd go thru periods where i'd be fine with myself, and other times where i'd just YEARN to be a girl.

and it IS exhausting. after years of frustration and depression, it just got to a point where i ran out of energy. i broke down and went to go see a therapist. and started transition pretty soon after that.  




 at least y'all get it covered. we here in the states are shit out of luck unless we have decent insurance, obamacare notwithstanding. 




  For ages there was no proof either of the US spying on their own citizens. Hell, there isn't proof that Israel owns nukes. That doesn't mean shit if you can connect the dots and draw your own conclusions.

again, you said that the CIA was out to get Chavez. that's a pretty bold claim. perhaps you have an inside track on some information that the rest of the world doesnt. please, share with the class. until you do, i'll file it away with the rest of the conspiracy theories.


and as far as communist countries go, if you want to argue semantics, go ahead, the UN classifies them as communist, so i'm going with it, pretty simple.

There is no active war against communism

ok, thanks, we're done 




  What, to correct you at the expense of being snowden-ed? Go find out for yourself. Look at the most recent 2002 coup, for example. The US admitted to meeting representatives of the Venezuelan opposition.

right, no proof, gotcha. thanks.

A communist state is a country run primarily on the principles of Marx and Engels with the end goal being the establishment of communist ideology worldwide. 

"Communist state" is a state that aims to achieve Socialism and then achieve Communism. Most communist states have been states with a form of government characterized by single-party rule or dominant-party system by a party which claims to follow communism, usually with a professed allegiance to Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology of the state. None of these states achieved communism, and the term is used no matter to what degree that state or the movement associated with it actually follows communism, if at all. nonetheless, they are considered communist. 

 Furthermore, both the war on drugs and on communism are very obviously connected by the effects they have on US foreign policy towards the Latin American region and therefore geopolitics.

we're not living in the 50's. there is no war against communism. that died when nixon went to china. the cuban exiles who are still mad at castro are fast becoming the minority. any conversation in miami today will show you that, and the polls show it as well.



 




 You may not believe in CIA actions against Chavez

if can point to a single shred of evidence that the CIA in your words "went after" Chavez, i'd be happy to stand corrected.

And of course China, Vietnam, North Korea and Cuba differ politically. Mostly because none of them are communist states.

this statement is so ludicrous, i cant even.

The Communist Party of China is the sole governing party of China, which  is organized on the basis of democratic centralism, a principle conceived by Russian Marxist theoretician Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies.

The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a single-party state. A new state constitution was approved in April 1992, replacing the 1975 version. The central role of the Communist Party was reasserted in all organs of government, politics and society. Only political organizations affiliated with or endorsed by the Communist Party are permitted to contest elections. 

According to policy experts and news reports, including the BBC World Service, North Korea continues to embrace a communist ideology and is a de facto communist government. In 2014, for example, the BBC Country Report on North Korea characterized it as a nominal communist government

The Communist Party of Cuba is the only political party permitted in the Republic of Cuba, others are not allowed to exist. It is a communist party of the Marxist-Leninist model.

The war against drugs and the war against communism aren't separate issues.

yes they are, because they're not even remotely connected to each other in any way shape or form.

However most of them are strongly anti-Castro.

again, you're wrong. Nearly 600,000 U.S. travelers went to Cuba last year  the majority of them Cuban Americans. 

http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/poll-cuba-obama-cuban-americans-florida-116570.html

http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/11/us-cuba-usa-poll-idUSKBN0M72KO20150311

Regardless my point is that it's in Cuba's better interests to seek trade opportunities in solidarity with the latin american nations instead, even if only to maintain its economic sovereignity from the US. 

once the embargo is lifted, cuba can establish ties with whichever country they want to. right now, they cant, because the trade embargo penalizes countries and corporations who do business with cuba. 




 well first off, it's not polite to ask a trans person if they've had surgery. and trans dudes exist too, it's not just women. there's more to a person than which bathroom we use. but to answer your question, far more trans women get harassed and assaulted in women's restrooms. you know how women have been assaulted by trans women in women's restroom? none. zero. nada. zilch.  




 Venezuela is socialist, not communist. and i'd love to see proof that the CIA "went after" him. otherwise, stop peddling that conspiracy theory crap.

and Cuba is communist, like vetnam, china, and north korea, and you can see that communism is very different in each of those countries. 

you cant mix up socialism either, because Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway are all socialist countries too.


you keep mixing up the war against communism and the war against drugs, both of which are equally ludicrous. the faster the US decriminalizes drugs the better. hopefully marijuana will be legal in more states by 2016 and mdma, lsd, and mushrooms will be taken off the banned list of drugs so that research can be conducted.

and finally, the US lies 90 miles away from the cuba, it is GOING be the biggest trading partner. miami might as well be another cuban city. the ties run too deep. 




 uh, which part in south america? the drug war is what is screwing up the economies of south america, not communism. besides, cuba is in the Caribbean, not south america. besides, are you actually advocating that the embargo stay? it's made life really hard for every day cubans. the sooner it goes, the better 




 no, it's science 




 cuba's economy is only the way it is BECAUSE of the US embargo. once castro dies, the boom in tourism is going to go thru the roof.  




 why do you hate your parents? did they do or not do something? and committing suicide isnt the answer, and writing a fake note isnt either. neither of these are a solution. what did you want to accomplish? did you want them to change their minds about something? maybe we can brainstorm together to find a different way to get to that point. 




 oh the irony.... 




 something , something, church and state 




 except that on reddit, we all have to abide by the rules that the admins set, and one of those rules is that nobody under 13 is allowed on. 




 whoopsies, that'll learn me to check my clipboard. i'm building a site for my friend

here ya go!

http://www.reddit.com/r/TransSpace/comments/36xmrj/wait_times_for_sexual_reassignment_surgery/

(thanks for looking out!) 




 we're actually working on providing links to published studies, as well as links to general information from the various medical organizations.

of course it always helps when people flag a comment that's questionable or that goes against established guidelines. we're human, and sometimes we miss things 




 trans girl/trans guy 




 they've given up in the gay marriage, that's why you see all these "religious freedom" laws popping up. segregationists did the same thing during the civil rights era. 




 soooo... a war against rhetoric? 

 nbsp;

^^i'll nbsp;see nbsp;myself nbsp;out nbsp;now 




 that would require an original idea 




 The distinction between sex and gender differentiates sex (anatomy of an individual's reproductive system, and secondary sex characteristics) from gender (social roles based on the sex of the person, usually culturally learned), or personal identification of one's own gender based on an internal awareness (gender identity). Gender is sometimes referred to as the sex of the brain. In some circumstances, an individual's assigned sex and gender do not align, and the result is sometimes a transgender person. 




 rules are rules, and as a mod you decide how they are applied. i abide by those rules.  




 dont let the door hit ya, where the good lord split ya 




 so let it be written, so let it be done 




 they now have hormone implants, so we can go 6 months or a year before needing it replaced. 




 um, no, again, i posted it because 1) i'm trans, 2) i was in the military. this article shows me that the attitudes are changing, ever so slowly, but changing all the same.

and believe me, if i posted to srs every time i ran into a homophobe or a transphobe, that's all i'd be doing on reddit. i DO however want to try and change attitudes myself.

i cant change the fact that i'm trans. i CAN try and change perceptions of trans people so that maybe someday, we can serve openly.
 




 i'd agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong.

;-) 




 it's the military, the rules dont always makes sense 




 becuz rules.

(and try not to use the T word, would ya? it's considered a slur) 




 i see, because i mod queer news sites and have to populate those queer news sites with articles, it's considered "spam"? i also post to /r/atheism and /r/science, but i guess those would be "articles of interest" right? 

this article was relevant to me as a trans woman and as someone who served her country (full disclosure - not US Military). if you want i could get my jarhead friends to repost this.

there are transgender vets from all branches of the service, that's a fact. and there will CONTINUE to be trans people who serve, as a mod of a few transgender subs, i know this to be true because i know several people who are currently on active service.

i posted it here because it was apropos for both me and the sub. why dont you try reading the article first before you judge.  




 i try not to post buzzfeed links, but this was a pretty good one as far as their stories go. 




 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand this is why i post stories like this here. simply because transphobic people like you are still around. lots of us trans girls served because we saw the military as a last chance to "man up". doesnt make our service any less meaningful than yours. when we're done, we transition. and some of us need help with that from the VA. thankfully, the VA isnt as transphobic as you. 

 




 you're welcome! 




 wait, hold up, you think a story about transgender vets getting the help they need from the VA is clickbaity? 




 nah, my bible thumping fam fam had WAY more issues over me being transgender and a lesbian than me being an atheist, 




 come on ireland, you can do this! 




 c'mon ireland, you can do this!!!

woooooo! 




 gender and sex are very different. sex is who you go to bed with, gender is who you go to bed as. 




 ok, there's a lot going on here, so let's break it down, it'll be easier to handle in chunks. taken altogether, it's overwhelming.

ok, first thing you have to know is that you can transition on the DL, you'll just need a sports bra when the boobs start coming in. either that, or maybe it's time to find some on campus accommodation.

if you have your health insurance thru your school,  trying sending your hormones to a PO Box, they're relatively easy to get, or send it to a friend you trust. (i'm going to assume your parents will snoop)

now, uni. if it's not too late, drop the classes you're behind in, i'm assuming your grades are crappy. it's ok, classes can be retaken. no biggie, it'll be ok.

most of all, take a little time out and have a deep breath, you dont have to do everything at once. it's not hopeless when you break it down into itty bitty little steps. 

like /u/Yveris, when i had my breakdown, it wasnt pretty. i holed up in my apartment for two months during my awkward, inbetweeny stage. i popped a lot of Xanax because i was having panic attacks ALL the time. almost lost my job, almost got kicked out of my apartment. urgh, those were NOT fun times.

but i CAN tell you is that when i got thru that, it started getting easier, i stopped getting the stares and everybody just started gendering me female.

you can do this too. you gotta just look to what your next step is, just work to cross that thing off your list. you gotta do it one step at a time.

you can do this.

 




 it'll be fine, just remember, it only sucks for awhile 




 3 3 




 stop by /r/asktransgender if you're feeling down, or if you want to check in, or need a pick-me-up, we're always there to help

also, good luck! 




 or a chris hansen special 




 but it always helps to have backup ;-)

thanks!

Position Statement on Access to Care for Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012)  
 The American Psychiatric Association:  
1. Recognizes that appropriately evaluated transgender and gender variant individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical gender transition treatments.  
2. Advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage for gender transition treatment.  
3. Opposes categorical exclusions of coverage for such medically necessary treatment when prescribed by a physician.

Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals
(2012)  
 Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.  

**The American Psychiatric Association:**  
1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.  
2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.  
3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.  
4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons.

Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression Non-Discrimination (2008)
As stated in the Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression NonDiscrimination,
the APA opposes all public and private discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity and expression and urges the repeal of discriminatory laws and policies and calls upon psychologists in their professional roles to provide appropriate, nondiscriminatory treatment to transgender and gender variant individuals and encourages psychologists to take a leadership role in working against discrimination towards transgender and gender variant individuals. 

The APA recognizes the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public and private insurers to cover these medically necessary treatments.

Resolution No. 1004 (2012)
In 2007, an AAFP Commission declared that the association has a policy opposing any
form of patient discrimination and stated its opposition to the exclusion of transgender
health care. In 2012, the organization released a new resolution: RESOLVED, That the
American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) support efforts to require insurers to
provide coverage for comprehensive care of [transgender] individuals including medical
care, screening tests based on medical need rather than gender, mental health care, and,
when medically necessary, gender reassignment surgery.

[S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures...


The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not cosmetic or elective or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition.

**National Commission on Correctional Health Care**


Position Statement: Transgender Health Care in Correctional Settings (2009) 

The health risks of overlooking the particular needs of transgender inmates are so severe that acknowledgment of the problem and policies that assure appropriate and responsible provision of health care are needed.  
Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the
biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis.

**American Medical Association**  
Resolution: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)  
An established body of medical research demonstrates the effectiveness and medical necessity of mental health care, hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery as forms of therapeutic treatment for many people diagnosed with GID Therefore, be it
RESOLVED, that the AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for  treatment of gender identity disorder.

**American Psychiatric Association**  
Position Statement on Access to Care for Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012)  
 The American Psychiatric Association:  
1. Recognizes that appropriately evaluated transgender and gender variant individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical gender transition treatments.  
2. Advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage for gender transition treatment.  
3. Opposes categorical exclusions of coverage for such medically necessary treatment when prescribed by a physician.

Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals
(2012)  
 Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.  

**The American Psychiatric Association:**  
1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.  
2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.  
3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.  
4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons.

 awwwww, thanks! 




 you identify with your gender before puberty 




 http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/11/11/hey-yall-southern-accents-voted-most-attractive/ 




 i'm always on /r/asktransgender if you want to ask questions! or send me a PM 




 yeesh, to tell each of the people in my inner circle, i had to practically chug an entire bottle of wine before i could send them an IM. (i was too chicken to tell them face to face. and right after i told everybody, i was even MORE terrified because there was no going back at that point. i had the whole "WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST DO?" moment.

and the first 6 months of transition was rough, i HATED the inbetweeny stage. urgh. when people dont quite know what gender you are and they just STARE, or whisper. god i hated the whispers.

now i'm having a blast. altho i kick myself for not coming out sooner.

Fear is a bitch. 




 sometimes we just know. i knew at 7, but spent the next 33 years in denial. 




 She, please use the proper pronouns, it's only common courtesy. you wouldnt like it if somebody kept misgendering you, so please stop doing it. it's insulting.

and yes, if a child identifies as transgender, they are taken to a therapist and if a diagnosis of gender dysphoria is given then depending on how far along puberty they are on the Tanner scale, puberty blockers or hormones are prescribed. this is true for bot transgender girls and boys.  




  Is it really possible for a prepubescent girl to be trans?

yes

and stop mixing up sexuality and gender, those are distinct from one another.

[Children as young as two can struggle with gender identity](http://www.wdbj7.com/news/local/early-years-children-as-young-as-two-can-struggle-with-gender-identity/33124652)

Wouldn't it be easy for a child to fake being trans just to be a part of a club? 

ok, think about what you just asked. you're asking a child, who at that point in their life just wants to fit and with all their friends, to do something that would make them COMPLETELY different from all their friends.

besides, there are criteria that doctors and therapists use before they give a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. 




 aint THAT the truth. i pushed it for as long as i could, because i was SO scared of transitioning. you know, the usual questions, "what if i dont pass?" "will anyone find me attractive?" "what will my friends/family say?" etc etc ad nauseum, ad infinitum.

i just ran out of energy to fight it anymore. 

i'm WAY happier now! 




 transgender females are females, they arent boys. and gender has nothing to do with sexual development. your gender identiy kicks in at a very early age.  




 girl, trans girl. the girl scouts only accept girls. 




 hey you started transition way before me, i only started at 39 




 i think those are really good questions. i hope somebody does a follow up study with those in mind 




 actually, according to the DSM V, it's no longer a disorder. being transgender now falls under "gender dysphoria" 




 urgh, gross. so much for "family values" 




 they're true, his dad was the one who turned him in, the only reason he didnt get charged was that the detective in charge was a pedophile too and was hoarding all the evidence he had collected for himself. the cop was removed from the case, tried, and convicted, but by the time they got around to trying to carge duggar, the statue of limitations had expired.

TL;DR: he's guilty, but didnt get charged because of a technicality 




 the latter 




 you're allowed to specify, so in this case, TEXAS House

*edit: dang it, they changed the headline, so you're right 




 nope 




 Ok, which of you raptors has been sending sexy pics to the straight friend that you're desperately in love with? C'mon, 'fess up! 




 [we destroy objective reality](http://www.politicususa.com/2015/05/17/mat-staver-transgender-rights-destroy-objective-reality-2.html) 




 well, i'm trans, and i knew what the pastors were telling me about sex and gender didnt quiiiiiiiiite line up with reality, at least in the way i was experiencing it. so that's when it started, i figured, if they were wrong about that, i wondered what ELSE were they wrong about. and the things that happen in the bible and the contradictions and the stuff you had to take on faith.... it was a slippery slope right toward atheism. 




 [like this?](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/18/us-health-sexual-males-idUSKBN0O31M220150518)

 they're the ones that eat the babies, right? or do they do the earthquakes? it changes so often that i cant keep track even with the cabal meeting notes 




 hey, at least you admitted your mistake. i went to summer bible camp for ten years, i was a true believer.... right up until i started going to those camps. the more i read the bible, the less sense it made. 




 yeeeeeeeeeeeeeup 




 isnt it? 




 it always amazes me to find out people ACTUALLY believe this shit 




 lol 




 oh yes, at this point, it's a complete hodge podge. it's amazing that anyone can understand me at all 




 dont forget "class", that one's a dead give away, because the brit in me slips out. every time i say it people give me a weird look. 




 just out of curiosity, what were the other more ludicrous titles there? 




 just a little bit to their left.... 




 Oh, dogs. Sure, I like dags. I like caravans more.

 yeesh, the fear of not passing, that's a really common fear among trans people, guys and girls alike. the height isnt a big deal, just go onto /r/tall and you'll see plenty of cis girls way taller than you. hell, you'd be one of the shorties.

and as for your shoulders? [here's jesslyn](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=e7d_1298068190)

never doubt the power of hormones, makeup, and the right clothes.

i was terrified of not being able to pass as female. my therapist suggested very firmly that i start seeing her in girlmode, and for the first few times, i hid behind a hat and sunglasses, and i practically RAN to her office. she had a helpful piece of advice, she called what i was experiencing Other People's Disease. and she was right, i was transitioning because i was trans, not to pass some arbitrary standard of some nebulous concept in my head of what an ideal female was supposed to look like. once you start owning who you are, it gets easier to deal. "passing" for what it is worth, comes a lot of the time just from confidence and a little slight of hand. like i said, hormones, makeup, and the right clothes.

so, if you decide to join us on the journey to planet girl, feel free to send me a PM if you wanna talk, or post another question here, there'll always be someone here to help

 The typical American woman will have two children in her lifetime. That means she will spend more than three decades trying to avoid pregnancy.

The most effective contraceptives are IUDs and implants. These methods are up to 20 times more effective than the birth control pill in preventing pregnancy, and they are often the safest options for women.

But high up-front costs put these methods out of reach for a lot of women. Insurance coverage for contraception without a co-pay would allow a woman to choose the best method for her, not just what fits in her budget. Taking away coverage would effectively block access to those most-effective methods.

Birth control is not only safe and effective preventive care, it is also care that physicians support and millions of women need. Allowing an employer's personal values to trump his or her employees' right to care would allow the beliefs of the few to trump the health of many. That's both bad policy and bad medicine. 




 i have no problem with your faith, right up to the point where the followers and leaders of said faith try to impose the beliefs of the faith onto me.  




 just wanted to point out how ludicrous it was 




 **Women like their birth control:**

* 99% of women who have had sex have used contraceptives at some point. Its already a near-universal practice.

* Opponents of contraceptive coverage are in the minority. In a recent NPRThompson Reuters poll, 77% of respondents said that private insurance plans should cover some or all of the cost of birth control pills. If the plan is subsidized by the government, 74% of respondents thought it should cover some or all of the cost.

* Women who have used birth control pills have been found to have fewer cases of anemia (low red blood cells), ovarian cancer, and uterine cancer. These beneficial effects occur because the birth control pill works by decreasing the number of ovulations, amount of menstrual blood flow, and frequency of periods.

* Taking the Pill helps prevent or reduce the occurrence of functional cysts (the most common kind of ovarian cyst), which form when ovulation goes awry.

* Oral contraceptives are also used to treat cystic acne, a potentially scarring condition that affects women even into their forties.

**Why we need birth control:**

* Half of pregnancies among American women are unplanned. Of unplanned pregnancies, 4 in 10 end in abortion. Preventing unplanned pregnancy prevents abortions.

* Contraception is estimated to save $19 billion a year in costs related to unplanned pregnancies. Increasing access will increase savings.

* Contraception supports and improves women and childrens health outcomes by enabling women to plan the spacing and timing of their pregnancies. It is also used to address health issues such as preventing ovarian cysts or endometrial and ovarian cancers.

* Access to free birth control leads to lower rates of abortions and teen births, according to a new and extensive study from Washington University in St. Louis.

* The average cost per publicly financed unintended pregnancy is nearly $10,000.

* New York Citys teen pregnancy rate has decreased by 27% over the past decade. And Health Commissioner Tom Farley attributes the change, in part, to the provision of contraceptives in public schools. 




  Corinthians Chapter 7

i see, so if we apply that, then we have to abolish divorce too, right?

10 To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. 11 But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.

and we can bring back slavery, right?

21 Were you a slave when you were called? Dont let it trouble you

or are we cherry picking? because if we're cherry picking, they i freely choose to ignore everything in the bible that i disagree with. 




 you raise some good points 




 riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight. you keep telling yourself that 




 so in other words, even tho the bible is filled with "thou shall not" verses, which are rather specific in their meaning, you cannot show a single verse that specifically states that one should not practice contraception. got it. 




 i'm asking again where in the bible it specifically states that practicing contraception goes against the word of god. also, while we're at it, since you brought it up, please show me where in the bible it specifically says to practice celibacy until marriage.  




 the current genration isnt as hung up about gender and sexuality. it is a far more accepting world, from women's colleges accepting transgender females, to more positive roles on screen and in print. even the tabloids are toning it down as can be shown in the coverage of bruce jenner's transition. there are federal, state, and city protections for trans and gay people.

homophobic and transphobic religious outlooks like yours are ever more the minority. and the world is a better place for it.  




 can you please show me where contraception goes against the word of god?  i must have missed the part where jesus said, "thou shall not hath thou pill!" 




 right right, adam's apple the size of a fist, man hands, and anynumber of insults you use to hurl at trans women, like i said, transphobia. there are none so blind. 

using your hypothetical situation of a trans woman at a bar. if you're chatting up a girl and you find out she's trans and you're uncomfortable with the thought of sleeping with her, even though you were attacted to her before, here's what you say,

"i'm sorry, i'm not comfortable with it. sorry for giving the wrong impression. i'm flattered that you would find me attractive enough to ask."

protip: also works for gay people hitting on you

protip 2: always observe the golden rule, i.e., dont be a dick 




 please see "lack of evidence." should eveidence arise that shows proof of god or life after death, i will happily change my outlook. 




 i tried looking for it, but i couldnt find it, i'd love to read what you thought 




 i know, but we always get so excited by the rise of the "nones" 




 fear of death is no reason to sacrifice logic for comfort. we do know that when we die, we cease to exist on this plane of existence. if there is another plane we go to, nobody has yet found it. to say that we go on in some form without any evidence does us a disservice.

that's the whole basis of the "god of the gaps" theory, where where anything and everything that science doesnt have an answer for must be proof of "god" 




 i'll take banana for $500 for the next question, alex 




 yes, people like you like to think that trans women go around and hang out in bars for the sole purpose of "tricking" men into sleeping with them. 

trans women are women, and there are plenty of men who think so. they just have to weed out the bigots like you. 

 




 as a trans girl, i too, love my HRT 




 Transphobia (or much less commonly transprejudice) is a range of antagonistic attitudes and feelings against transsexuality and transsexual or transgender people, based on the expression of their internal gender identity (see Phobia  Terms for prejudice). 




 ahhhh, i was wondering when the homo and trans phobia would show. took you long enough. always about the sex. you do realize that relationship are more than just sex right? and again, what people do behind closed doors is up to them. people like you always reduce it to sex, or the ick factor. well,  get over it. the world has changed, and we're all better for it. 

 




 none, zlich, nil 




 again, only religious fanatics cling to outdated ideas, as the rest of the world advances past them. 




 By the end of the 19th century, medicine and psychiatry were effectively competing with religion and the law for jurisdiction over sexuality. Thankfully, science won out. Early in the twentieth century, Havelock Ellis argued that homosexuality was inborn and therefore not immoral, that it was not a disease, and that many homosexuals made outstanding contributions to society.

Yes, they were wrong about a lot of things back then, and as science and medicine advance, our knowledge expands, and treatments, diagnoses, and definitions change. Religion, on the other hand, does not.

I live in a world of reason and logic. and there is no scientific basis for the need, or for that matter, the ability, to change a person's sexuality. 




 yeeeeeeup 




 Freud believed that a homosexual orientation should not be viewed as a form of pathology.

"Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function produced by a certain arrest of sexual development. Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals, several of the greatest men among them (Plato, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, etc.). It is a great injustice to persecute homosexuality as a crime, and cruelty too...."

Homosexuality was removed from the DSM because it was never an illness in the first place. 




 no, the DSM was changed in regards to homosexuality because of evidence that showed that it was not a disease. There is a debate in the medical and transgender communities about whether or not Gender Dysphoria should remain in the DSM. But only because some believe removing it could limit patients access to insurance coverage.
 




 while not all Singaporeans are homophobic or transphobic, there were enough of them to make me leave and not come back, and this was 20 years ago. honestly, i dont see myself going back at all.  




  Your confusing religious fundamentalism with life, reality, biology, history and, well, just about everything.

i'm not the religious fundamentalist here. and luckily, neither are any of the medical organizations. see, they make their protocols based on evidence and not what's written down in "holy" texts 




 Religious fundamentalism has been found to correlate positively with anti-homosexual bias. One way you can tell that people are starting from a conclusion and arguing backwards is when they bust out the everything-and-the-kitchen-sink strategy: Trying a bunch of different arguments in hopes that one sticks.

 




 people arent in pain with their sexuality or gender, they're in pain because people like you want to CHANGE their sexuality or gender. religion has it's place, you are free to believe whatever the hell you want. you cannot, however, impose those beliefs and values on others. 




 there are none so blind as those who cannot see.

dude, drop it already. if you cant see that your position goes against the collective procedures of every single medical organization on this planet, then i cant help you.

the only people still advocating for conversion therapy are religious organizations. 

seriously, let it go, you'll be a happier person. 




 no, every tans person is unique, and they experience dysphoria in different ways. and they may or may not get different kinds of surgeries. or none, if the case may be 




 racist much?

fingerprints are a unique identifier that a different from person to person, i.e. unlike race or gender

psychological trauma again implying that some trauma leads people to be gay or trans, which goes against all current establish medical evidence to the contrary 

absent parents, again imply trauma leads people to be gay or trans, which goes against all current establish medical evidence to the contrary  




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_of_Care_for_the_Health_of_Transsexual,_Transgender,_and_Gender_Nonconforming_People

but you go right ahead and keep calling the WPATH a "political" organization. in the meanwhile, here's more:- 

The American Psychological Association is the largest scientific and professional organization representing psychology in the United States, with more than 122,500 researchers, educators, clinicians, consultants and students as its members.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of "gender dysphoria."

A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder.

 Researchers adept at analyzing the genetic threads of human diversity say that the concept of race--the source of abiding cultural and political divisions in American society--simply has no basis in fundamental human biology.

With the tools of molecular biology, scientists can peer past superficial characteristics to explore more powerful, underlying genetic commonalities and differences, which are making racial categories look increasingly arbitrary and irrelevant, the experts said.

"Biologically, we are saying in essence that race is no longer a valid scientific distinction," said Solomon H. Katz, a University of Pennsylvania anthropologist.

"Race is a social construct derived mainly from perceptions conditioned by events of recorded history, and it has no basic biological reality," said C. Loring Brace, a biological anthropologist at the University of Michigan.

"The old biological definitions of race were based on what people looked like," said Joseph L. Graves Jr., an evolutionary biologist at Arizona State University West. "Now that we have better ways of looking at race . . . we could construct races based on what type of fingerprints people have, or on what kind of blood type they have, and that would be just as legitimate." 




 There is no single explanation for why some people are transgender. The diversity of transgender expression and experiences argues against any simple or unitary explanation. Many experts believe that biological factors such as genetic influences and prenatal hormone levels, early experiences, and experiences later in adolescence or adulthood may all contribute to the development of transgender identities.

A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of "gender dysphoria." Some contend that the diagnosis inappropriately pathologizes gender noncongruence and should be eliminated. Others argue that it is essential to retain the diagnosis to ensure access to care. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is under revision and there may be changes to its current classification of intense persistent gender incongruence as "gender identity disorder."

 




 it's for minors 




 the bill is for the protection of minors, so that parents cant force their kids to those pray-away-the-gay camps. as an adult, if you want to fool yourself into thinking that you can change your sexuality, go right ahead. 




  There ARE documented cases of success with conversion therapy.

no, no there arent. nada. zip. zero.

The most important fact about these therapies is that they are based on a view of homosexuality that has been rejected by all the major mental health professions. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, six published by the American Psychiatric Association, which defines the standards of the field, does not include homosexuality. All other major health professional organizations have supported the American Psychiatric Association in its declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder in 1973. Thus, the idea that homosexuality is a mental disorder or that the emergence of same-sex attraction and orientation among some adolescents is in any way abnormal or mentally unhealthy has no support among any mainstream health and mental health professional organizations. 




 they've tried changing the mind to fit the body, and it never worked.

 you can wander to your heart's content, it's just when it comes to the actual "light up" that you have to leave. like i sed, tis a silly place. 




 as a tourist? prolly fine. and there are gay clubs there if you're into that sort of thing. it's just as a citizen, gay people often have the short end of the sticl 




 The WPATH Standards of Care for Gender Identity Disorders were first issued in 1979, and articulate the "professional consensus about the psychiatric, psychological, medical and surgical management of GID." Periodically revised to reflect the latest clinical practice and scientific research, the Standards also unequivocally reflect the Association's conclusion that treatment is medically necessary.

Sex (gender) reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures. Genital reconstruction is not required for social gender recognition, and such surgery should not be a prerequisite for document or record changes; the Real Life Experience component of the transition process is crucial to psychological adjustment, and is usually completed prior to any genital reconstruction, when appropriate for the patient, according to the WPATH Standards of Care. Changes to documentation are important aids to social functioning, and are a necessary component of the pre-surgical process; delay of document changes may have a deleterious impact on a patient's social integration and personal safety.

 

Medically necessary sex reassignment procedures also include complete hysterectomy, bilateral mastectomy, chest reconstruction or augmentation as appropriate to each patient (including breast prostheses if necessary), genital reconstruction (by various techniques which must be appropriate to each patient, including, for example, skin flap hair removal, penile and testicular prostheses, as necessary), facial hair removal, and certain facial plastic reconstruction as appropriate to the patient.

"Non-genital surgical procedures are routinely performed... notably, subcutaneous mastectomy in female-to-male transsexuals, and facial feminization surgery, and/or breast augmentation in male-to-female transsexuals. These surgical interventions are often of greater practical significance in the patient's daily life than reconstruction of the genitals." 


Furthermore, not every patient will have a medical need for identical procedures; clinically appropriate treatments must be determined on an individualized basis with the patient's physician. 




 because they tried changing the mind to fit the body and it doesnt work. that's why the recommended course of treatment for transgender individuals is to transition. 




 yes, make fun of it. like the racists who made fun of desegregationists. because that's the company you're keeping right now. 




 lol, you'll do just fine, come on over to the sub, plenty of interesting convos going on 




 yes, i noticed

:-p 




 non-op, i got all the parts i was born with, altho, i did promise my bestie that if i ever had my testicles removed, he could hang em from his rearview mirror like fuzzy dice. 




 thanks! 




 hmm, i use a 16g to draw, but even with an 18g it shouldnt be that hard to draw. and you're doing everything right. do you know anybody else that can show you how to draw? can you go back to the clinic and get a nurse to show you how to draw? 




 YAY!! congrats on getting on hrt. glad the sub has helped.  




 well come over to /r/genderqueer, plenty of non binaries for you talk to. 




 i stand corrected 




 lol, all the other gay and lesbian couples and groups that i know are perfectly happy with each other. i'm pretty good with my two girlfriends. and we get on great with other straight people who arent all tied up into knots trying to reconcile their faith with the new reality.

opinions like yours are fast fading into memory. and while they'll prolly always be around, just like racism is still with us, they will be reviled for the homophobic and transphobic thought that they are.

there are more people today who fight for equality than there are people like you tryin g to sow hate and fear and division. that's why we're winning and that's why we will continue to win. inclusion helps everybody feel a part from society, exclusionary ideas that you push, just isolate you more and more. 




 i had enough problems switching from boy to girl, i am NOT going back 




 huh? conversion therapy is an attempt to force the conversion of someone's sexuality, in the case of minors, usually against their will.  




 yeah, you and me both 




 you seem unusually concerned by what two people do behind closed doors and by what gender they are. is there anything you'd like to to talk about? feel free. like i sed, no judgements here 




 this bill is specifically for minors. if you're an adult, you can do whatever you want 




 because all the the major medical institutions have labeled conversion therapy as ineffective and harmful. you are free to believe whatever you want, you are not free to forcefully impose those beliefs by sending your child away to reeducation camps. 




 actually, it doesnt at all, wanna know why? because loving another person is a wonderful experience. we only limit ourselves by adhering to the rigid sex and gender binaries. sex, like gender is a broad spectrum. we are made lesser by not exploring other options. just as travel broadens the mind, exploring our gender and sexuality broadens it too.
