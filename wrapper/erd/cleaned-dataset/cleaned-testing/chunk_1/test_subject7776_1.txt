 During school I am perfectly fine, I laugh (Well... giggle), smile, and am generally a positive person. I get all my work done in class, I never have homework, I help out people when asked. I try my best to just help. But when I get home I am instantly having suicidal thoughts, I fight with my girlfriend, and I just overall hate everything.

I feel like I'm just a horrible person, I believe I have let my father down. He wanted a smart child who likes what he is into, But I'm not smart in my eyes, and I don't like sports and NASCAR and all of that stuff, I tried to play sports to please him but after I cracked my head I said "I don't want to play sports again" and I haven't. I like games, and girls...
I've never heard my parents say "I love you." I know its hard to believe but I just haven't. They don't go out on dates, or kiss or anything. I feel like its my fault.
People think, "Oh Travis, You have it was easy you get what you want and can do whatever."
But getting what I want isn't fine. My parents do not have a college savings account for me, nor my brother. My brother (who is smart) got a little bit of a scholarship and it makes it easy for him to go. I, however will not get a scholarship, I don't get 100% on tests and I don't do the best work.
So, I don't know what I'll do for college. I don't want my family to take out another loan. I would like my parents to just go out on dates, and act like a married couple.
I take medicine but the dosage seems to be too small, if I take 2 I'm happy all day and everything is fine.
I noticed myself getting depressed after a break-up, I tried so hard to make everything up and talk to her, I wrote a 6 page letter to her, and she just ignored it. Awhile later I had tried to search our home for a pistol we keep for safety. I searched often when no one was home and could never find it, and I'd usually end up sitting on the bed and crying.
On my birthday, sadly, I had tried to OD. My birthday wasn't good.

I don't want to die, and I don't want to have these thoughts, but they won't leave me alone. I just want to have my parents be a couple, I want my my father to say hes proud of me, And I want to be happy.

Help? 




 Ah, thank you. And one last thing, do you know how much a Gold Botkiller Rocket Launcher is? 




 Thank you, so its 20keys or a bud? 




 Thank you!

 For the love of all the is tasty, I need a box or two. D: I miss them! 




 But... But... I want some too.. 




 I'm from Arizona, we don't have much but if you like any Arizonian snack and you happen to have some Oreo O's, I will gladly try my best to get the snack you want! 




 Can/Will/Does anyone have Oreo O's that they can ship to Arizona, USA?

 For the love of that is notch, can you put animals in. The real DayZ has Cows and Boars, so why can MineZ have Cows and Pigs?

I was way out in x 800 z -3000, in giant open fields and no town near, and I starved.. so please put animals in. 




 Shit Tyrone, get it together.

 I did Nazi that coming. 




 Too soon it seems. 




 Reason why I own Photoshop, is for things like this. 









 Thanks man :DDDDD 




 Hell yeah! :D 




 I put it on the pandas forehead, seeing as it wont go to the bottom right D: 




 Simple is special ;) 



















 Its fine, I understand that some people don't have the money. 




 I was wondering if any of you fine non-zombie people would actually donate to make a DayZ Lingor Island server in the US. I know a person who is whitelisted for a spot by the Lingor Hive. The only problem is we'd need money to host it. It'd be the only US server.

So, would anyone actually donate? 









 Ah, didn't see. Thanks :D 




 Except for sex. 









 I think this would be an amazing map to play DayZ on. 









 Honestly, its all good. You can keep trying to kill us, like the [NC] Clan. We're waiting. 




 Come at me bro. 




 Thank you for the hour long fire fight, deaths, and walk backs to the hill. I'm sorry a hacker had to come in a ruin the fun, hopefully we can fight again. But why would you have a camp up there in the hill? 




 Back when you spawned with a Mak, I shot a kid for lols. 




 I jumped... 




 Well, you gave me a good impression of the game which led me to buy it. :D 




 When you spawn in it'll say "Day x" (x being the day you've been alive) 




 This is what you get if you upload the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXIpPORrOKo 




 Uploading the video to YouTube at the moment. 




 lol its alpha 




 It was my first character ever made in Day Z, I spawned in Cherno (Though I didn't know that was its name). I had somehow found a friend, who was new as well and thought me how to use voice comm. We went around the building and found the hospital. I stumbled upon some Anti-Biotics and headed up the roof. I called for my friend to come look at the view and I made a dash for the ladder to see if he was coming, I ran off the roof and died instantly. 




 Oh, you fancy huh? 




 LOL 




 Yes. Yes. Yes. 




 wow, we're all in Chandler!! 




 A girl who likes me sent this to me, it always makes me smile.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0Ohl3MMq0o

Shes an amazing girl.

I mean really. 




 lol dont join unless you like to get raped by the AI 









 ART! D: 




 Russian server, very peaceful. 




 Welcome to the dark side, we've been expecting you. 














 I'm sorry, I don't have enough money to gift you it. Hopefully someone else will help you! I'm sorry. Have faith! The reddit community is full of good, friendly, and kind people! Hope to see you around DayZ sometime, hopefully soon ;)! 




 I know what I'm going to do now...

I keep reading this, its just so good.. 




 It'd be amazing getting a free copy, I could play with my friend who I literally do everything with, It'd just be nice to finally play a survival game with her and not play WoW all the time. Thank you for being super generous. Have a wonderful day. 




 I feel like I've killed you before... 




 Most of the day. 




 I did this today as well. TX20, It's very fun. 




 Contact me here or VIA steam. (test_subject7776) 




 Amazing shot. 




 fags. 




 LOL
Oh god, Olive, you, you're a funny man. 




 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVvxCdNv2vc 









 Ah, thank you both very much! :D 




 I was wondering what Add-on you need in order to have high quality skins and such? Any help would be appreciated! 




 Must have. 




 T'is a big bitch. 




 We're not mad. :P 




 So we were playing Day Z (7 of us) and we were in an open field checking a deer stand (of course it had nothing), we heard a shot and one of us died, we all proned down and DC'd. (Yes wussy move, wanna fight about it?) We reconnected to a new server and messed around in the field recollecting ourselves and healing our injured. The moment we were all ready to go we heard another shot and again, another friend got shot and died. We all hit the deck and now we're just waiting it all out.

Now I'm scared. 




 AHHHH THIS GUY! 




 You lead our group through the thick and thin, but in the end you just couldn't get to the ladders fast enough... 









 It's pretty sexy :3 




 I tried to get a real screenshot, but eh it takes pictures of my wallpaper instead. 




 lmao. 




 So I spawned in, found a house and a nice pair of Binoculars, I took them and then.. well these just randomly spawned. I can't pick them up, and they don't look like hatchets and crowbars... 









 How old are you? 




 priceless. 




 Oh god, this is amazing. 




 I'm on -7 time, but I'll play! 




 Anyone?
