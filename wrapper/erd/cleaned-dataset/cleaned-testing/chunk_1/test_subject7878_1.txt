 You gotta play ["Los Cuates de Sinaloa"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUmpTKXpIdM) all the time in your car now.  ;) 




 Leaked images? Why haven't I seen these? 




 Not really, what I want and what Republicans want aren't always synonymous.

Examples:

1. Legalize friggin' marijuana already.
2. Let anyone get married at any institution that will perform the ceremony.
3. Pull all troops from any foreign country; let them protect OUR boarders, not other countries' boarders.
4. No more foreign aid until we no longer have national debt.
5. Disband the IRS, and enforce a flat tax.  It's fair.  Poor people buy cheaper things; rich people buy more expensive things.  It's fair; quit whining.
6. etc...

 To paraphrase Ronald Regan:

I didnt leave the Republican party, the Republican Party left me.

Don't get me wrong, I can't STAND Democrats, but I've slowly started hating Republicans more and more since I turned 18 back in 1999.  They're all talk, and no action.  The "Republican" candidates that do get into office are so middle-of-the-road, that nothing happens.

I think I will now consider myself a Conservative Libertarian.  Screw the (D)/(R) parties.  I'm sick of this crap. 



















 Ah.... j'aime l'inceste. 




 Well, terrorist don't seem to care what the Christians are doing; just that they're Christians... so the "Reverse-terrorism" label still stands. 




 "Reverse-terrorism"? 




 Really?  My trumpet doesn't play a note simply because I push a valve down. 




 Sampler is a button representing a set sound.

Beatboxing is live sound using an instrument (vocal and percussion). 




 Hell yes!

Kanye = listed as being able to play "keyboards", "sampler" (not even an instrument), "percussion", and "sythesizer".

Beck = listed as being able to play "guitar", "keyboards", "bass", "drums", "harmonica", "percussion", "sitar", "banjo", "slide guitar", "12-string guitar", "glockenspiel", "vocorder", "kalimba", "melodica", and "beatboxing".

I'd say Beck is a better musician. 




 Covered?  No.

A few large, dark hairs?  Yes.  Enough that it's unsettling. 




 Yeah, even MORE surfaces to get saturated in urine! 




 Every time I see this, all I see is the duck that the Americas turns into. 




 Do you ladies sometimes milk being pregnant to make people do things for you? I swear that my wife did that during each pregnancy. 




 Because most dudes don't like sucking on a hairy nipple. 




 Lady Margery of Pimbleton.  




 Herp-derp...  




 It's satirical humor.  Get a sense of humor, why don't ya? 









 Oh, my God--That needs to happen! 




 Amen to that! 




 Interesting infographic! Thanks! 




 I can't stand the dude either. 




 He's done so many of them, though. 




 Amen! 




 Bodyguards protect people from other people, not from themselves. 




 The only downside to metric time would be that a year wouldn't match the rotation of the Earth. 




 Yep.  That's exactly my point! 









 She was a little to flat for me, but she had nice nips. 




 The same nail bed, just has a gap where the nail bed might be dead.

Does it grow back at the same rate as the larger part? 




 Unfortunately, what this idiot doesn't realize is that this was an AMA... not a Kanye Music Award.

If this fuck-nut wants to judge music, let him host and pay for his own show.  What a jackass. 




 Ingrown toenail, man. 




 What the heck ***is*** that? 




 Loved the shower scene back when I was 16-17.  HAHA! 




 Married for 5 years now with three kids.  We're great! 




 And you've never even HEARD of Beck?  I could understand not being able to name a song by someone, but not even knowing who they are...?

I couldn't name a Kanye West song, but I know who he is. 




 Haha!  Weird!  I watched that last night on Netflix for nostalgia's sake. 



















 Me: "Can you PLEASE stop being so lazy around the house? I work overtime hours to come home to a messy house and you watching television!  If I didn't do the dishes, cleaned up the house, do laundry, etc., then NO ONE would. It's getting really damn old, and you're setting a bad example for the three kids!" 









 "...who acknowledge Jesus with their lips, walk out the door, and deny Him by their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable."  ~Brennan Manning

I first heard this quote in the intro to DC Talk's "What If I Stumble?" back in 1995 when I was 14 years old.  I got it then, but it means so much more to me now that I'm coming up on 34.

I strive to be a good example for others, but more specifically for my children.  I try to keep this quote in mind.  Thought I'd share it in case others haven't heard it before. 



















 It seems unfair, counter-productive, and not a valid way of seeing what the actual PARTY members want. 




















































































 Okay, there was one moment that made my jaw drop at the utter stupidity of the scientists.

Miller's Planet... massive time dilation. The team went down to get the information.  Notice the massive waves.  Brand gets the idea in her head to go get data and gets stuck.  CASE is commanded to get her.  He suddenly transforms into SUPER-SPEED MODE!  

My jaw dropped in the theater.  I turned to my wife, and whispered, "What the HELL?!"

Why didn't they just send CASE down?  He could pilot the lander; he could go into super-speed mode; make assessments; get the data; come back; and it wouldn't have been 28 years lost.  Maybe half that.   














 That's the only thing I can think of. In America, we'll have a foreign song become popular occasionally. 



























































 I was raised in the Assemblies of God church.  My mother is still a registered AG pastor, in fact.  Come 16 years ago, my parents divorced, and I backslid.  I met my wife 13 years ago, and she and her family are very Catholic.

I converted through RCIA, and received all the sacraments at the Easter Vigil Mass in 2003.  The one thing I have never agreed with, and have not participated with is confession.

Why should we go through a mediary, like a priest, when we can go strait to God, and ask for forgiveness?  Didn't make sense then, and it doesn't make sense now.

 I never thought about it until I was posting in another topic. I guess I would classify it as its own separate entity.
