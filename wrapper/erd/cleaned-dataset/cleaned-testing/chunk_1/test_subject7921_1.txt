 Love the boobs, and you're very pretty. 




 I have tried full face masks, but don't use them regularly.

Some of them go over the chin, some go to the little dip in your chin below the "base" of your lower teeth.  They should not sit on your teeth at all, if it does, then it's too small.

The only full face mask I have ever seen that "strapping it down super tight" makes it fit better is one that looks like a fireman's mask, has like a clear open visor goes all the way up above your eyebrows and down to that dip below your lower teeth on your chin.

To give you an example, often times I will measure small or medium in over the nose masks, but small usually ends up with it leaking if I move much in most masks.  So there's the possibility you could go medium or large and they picked medium and it just isn't big enough to cover your face sufficient when you move a little causing leaks.


Looking at your specific mask.  The top strap is going to change how much that upper piece flexes against your forehead...if it's flexing even a little it should be tight enough to hold the mask to your nose at the top.

The lower strap you need to adjust it when you lay back in your normal sleeping position because if you adjust it sitting upright it won't fit right at all once you lay down.   Just get it close, then lay down and readjust WITH THE MACHINE ON.

Then your mask should be JUST loose enough to pick the whole mask up slightly off your face and seat it again where you think it needs to be. 

Then reason you pick it up off your face and put it back down is so that the rolled in edges of the piece on your face aren't pinched or pushed out of the mask causing it to leak.  They need to be inside the mask and against your face to it forms a pocket of air pushing out on the silicon pad walls making it conform to your face.   You just need your straps to be tight enough so that it conforms but doesn't make "fart" or squeaking noises indicating it's too loose.

I think your mask might be too small.

And from my experience MOST cpap users don't use full face masks when they've had some options to try and find one they like....it's either a nasal pillow (in the nose) or a around the nose type mask.   Full faces are usually for people who can't keep their mouth closed (which is also a sign of your cpap not being treated well) or who have facial issues like slackness due to strokes.


If you're really set on getting a full face mask...try looking into the fire fighter looking mask..  which is infact called a TOTAL face mask.

Can browse there for other ideas on stuff too, they have a pretty good selection.  A lot of doctor offices only carry one brand of masks or machines and kind of let you think it's your only options. 




 All of it sounds pretty normal for me.    I don't go out much at all anymore.  I make a whole lot of stuff into awkward dirty jokes and I'm allergic to bananas, they give me a itchy mouth which sounds stupid..but yeah.  Plus people look silly eating them.

 You should be able to run it off the car battery, but I would check into it as it could damage the units.  I know there were some people that came into a local support group talking about how they can no longer recommend a whole line of stuff for CPAPs due to issues and it voiding the warranties, etc.

They make special batteries for them, but they ALSO make little portable cpap units for using on flights and things that come with it's own battery unit that is pretty much small enough to like strap to your leg.  I forget the MFG.

For example, they were recommending marine batteries for cpaps due to how long they hold charge and put out power...now they no longer do that.    




 You = hot.

Let's hope you can't sleep more often?.....or something. 




 I do most of my book consumption video audiobooks.  And I find music to not add much to the experience and often detract from it.

I think they used to use it to make it easier to fastforward through cassettes and stuff where you could hear the sped up audio and it just kind of stuck.  

But.....unless you can prove it's really adding to the situation I'd avoid it.


Also, while it's not asked for.  Pronunciation is something that drives me crazy, even more so if they pronounce the same word differently since you don't have the text in front of you to check wtf they are trying to say.

Oh and characters with similar names, or names that start with similar sounds start to get rather confusing to me when there's a lot of dialog.
 




 I like what I've seen so far.  More requested. 




 1) If there is a shortage, these tradesman schools should have companies PAYING people's way through the school to get a standardized education they can build off of.

1b)  Companies are not doing this because they are purposefully driving wages down and using any and all excuses they can to do it.

2) Companies are looking at eminent failure if they don't have the people they need to do the work.

2b)  Again, they are outsourcing it and using any and all excuses to do so.  It's just a flat out lie.

3) You can't expect people to work at Walmart pay and also tell them that there should be dignity in their work.

3b)  Paying people minimum wage just reinforces that the job is not "skilled" or "desirable".  Which is another way they are driving the jobs to foreign labor and outsourcing when they can.



The only time this is going to change is when these companies keep assuming that the labor they find elsewhere is what they would get at the 80k+ range in the US...and it blows up in their face.   Then I hope workers who have been putting up with shit pay for the same work rake them over the coals nice and good to demonstrate how each and every other company out there doing this crap will suffer a similar fate come their "turning point".


College education requirement stuff is heading the same way.  It's like the exact opposite of Henry Ford's strategy.  Paying people enough so they can buy what they make....has turned into keeping prices the same and making more per unit while the people buying them make effectively less and less each year.  GENIUS!
 




 How long would you say this took?   If you don't mind saying.
 




 Ah only on the second part of the study then.  6cm is I THINK below the threshold.  I believe they told me a 7cm is like "normal" breathing pressure...but I could be wrong it's been awhile since I've been on anything under 10cm.  I actually went from a 14 to a 10cm recently due to medication changes...so always keep this in mind that medication CAN change your pressure if you suddenly get worse.  Drinking will too, I don't drink...but drinking is something they warn a lot against.


I think I've been on Cpap since.....2007ish.  And I've had 3 titration testings, the original and two re-titrates.  1 was due to a machine failure and wanting to make sure the pressure wasn't off, and the other was recently for medication changes and feeling like crap...got a new machine since it had been over 5 years.


My first titration was horrible, granted they were in a hospital building and I could hear things going down the hall and lots of external lights.  They moved to a new more separate location with more "bedroom" type designs and better light blockage etc.  But I had figured out what bugged me most about the room, was that it was too quiet.  I use an air filter at home and it's just generally noisier in the room I sleep in, and the quiet was just unnerving.  To combat the quiet they were able to get a box fan and place it in the room with me to create some noise.  The wires suck too, but it's better to just be cautious but sleep how you wanna sleep and wires be damned to be honest...because if you can't get to sleep..they aren't going to get any meaningful readings.  Oh they also had some sleep number beds, which were kinda fun to play with...much better than "hospital bed" beds.  

To get heated hoses you need a machine that supports it OR you can get one that is a third party hose and has a separate power brick to heat the hose..  My friend has one of the third party hoses and likes it, so either will work, but the built into the machine hose makes it use water a lot more efficiently which is just such a big difference for me.

AND this just came to me.  The newest machine offerings on CPAPs can be put into a "auto mode" where it will evaluate for itself what kind of pressure you need to some degree.  So they can send you home with the machine and it will try to figure out your needed pressure too so they have another source of information to pool from if the over night stays don't work out.  I don't know how much they use this, but I insisted they do it for me because I didn't believe I went from a 14cm to 10cm given that i had gained weight...and everything pretty much agreed.

Still want a longer heated hose....if any of you CPAP MFGs are reading this....10 foot heated hoses!  




 Have you tried sleeping without a pillow?  You might be holding your head differently because of the mask.  Ive found a lot of pillows to be rather uncomfortable with the masks and make me have to lay oddly causing neck pain, etc.

Also your mask shouldn't be too tight, they recommend allowing two fingers between the strap and face easily for "tightness" on most.

I know my back would hurt on CPAP because I wouldn't lay naturally with the mask on due to the tubing and everything else and being afraid of pulling the machine off the table for quite awhile.  The hose management thing took away the fear of pulling the machine off since it would have taken extreme force to do it. 




 Look at buying a hose management device if you can't move in bed without your mask coming off.  Cpap.com has some examples....I bought the "Hoser" or something like that.  Stopped having to wrestle the mask every time I moved.  Most I had to do was spin the connection on it to take pressure off the side that was pulling and move it to over my head or just unbind it where it got caught.    You may need a longer hose...which currently heated hoses are only 6 foot and people need to bug the hell out of them to make 8 and 10 foot ones so you can use management systems more easily.
 




 Have been on CPAP for a number of years, go to regular support group sessions a local sleep center offers.   I would recommend seeing if a support group exists because the people there will have ideas and recommendations most doctors won't even consider for comfort.

1) You can analyze the data yourself.  I have no experience with it but some of the companies even had bluetooth enabled things you can plug into the machine.

2) I don't use a UPS, but you need to make sure it doesnt beep when the power fails because that'll drive you crazy.  One bad night is not the end of the world, but going on three and you'll want to murder your power company.

3)  Once it's successfully treated:  You find a mask you like, you use it all night, and you've visited your doctor for a follow up visit after using it for a month....you SHOULD have knocked out daytime sleepiness.  

Hypertension may be alleviated some, but generally I found that if you are on meds you will stay on meds to deal with it unless you lose weight or find some other cause.  

Teeth grinding, it did absolutely nothing for me in stopping this.  In fact they seem almost to ignore it completely as a symptom of sleep apnea unless you notice it increasing/getting worse.  Some people recommend taking your mask to your dentist if you are getting fitted for any appliances because it can cause discomfort and stuff lines up a little different.

Morning headaches SHOULD be gone.  They were for me.  Although Ill wake up with a headache now and then depending on the weather, allergies, etc.

Feeling like crap......you should notice a marked difference a month in.  And it should only get better once you get more used to the machine.


My biggest beef with CPAPs in the current generation is that their heated hoses are too damn short.  A 6 foot hose is just long enough to get hung on everything but not long enough to elevated up off the bed and allow for tossing and turning.  I bought a hose management thing that works kind of like a fishing reel for my old machine and it made a HUMONGOUS difference in how much I had to futz with the mask in the night and uncoil myself.  Made for a much more sound sleep where I could just roll over and not wake up enough to remember.  So if by chance they do have a longer than 6 foot heated hose, GET IT is my recommendation.


The new machines are WAY better on water usage with their new humidifier designs and heated hoses....so you aren't draining the tank empty in dry dies and waking up with a dried out nose or crazy dry mouth.  If you're opening your mouth while sleeping, it's probably because of lack of humidity on CPAP.

Also build up a small collection of different masks.  Sometimes heavier masks are more comfortable in winter....or sometimes you'll get a pimple or ingrown hair and a different style mask will give it time to heal.

They also make sleeves for the hose, which kind of did the same thing as the heating on hoses does now.  But it also keeps you from touching cold hard plastic at night that might be distracting.

And use DISTILLED WATER in your humidifier, anything else builds up gunk on the bottom of your humidifier and causes you to inhale water that has a "smell" to it when it becomes gaseous and might irritate you.  It's cheap and now that they use so little water a gallon lasts me nearly 2 months so far, and saves you from having to use vinegar to break up the build up every few months.  

If you wake up with dried out eyes, it's a sign that your mask may be leaking by your nose.  Sometimes it can't be helped if you really like a certain style mask...and wearing a sleeping mask will keep it from really bothering you if you can't adjust it to stop it.
 




 What do you hope to do once you graduate as a chemistry student? 




 What kind of games do you develop? 




 I don't know about passion, but I enjoy fantasy fiction and some sci-fi books.  I usually listen to the audiobook versions if I can get my hands on them.   More of a thinker and a reader than a go out and do kind of person. 




 Just as a random thread I picked to read, you might want to take a moment to put some info about your book in the post when do giveaways.  Might generate some buys even if they don't win.   I know you included links, but never hurts to put a little more info in the post to catch eyes......maybe? 




 Sure, sounds like it could be informative.  Always wondered how much an impact the "test" readers had on the process. 




 What is expected of beta readers?

I do not believe I have read Hollow World or Riyria, but I have been known to confuse authors and book titles. 




 I like the coy smile. 




 Yep.  They also do this same thing with fake checks.  Chances are the "carrier company" is bogus as well.

Few things to look for obvious form letter responses.  Never mentions the  vehicle/item in question.  Can't name the carrier company or you can't find it when looking it up.

Easy test is to respond and mention a completely different car make/model and jack up the price a bunch to cover possible "fees" paypal, etc might have.  If he doesn't care, then scam....who cares what you get if it's free.
 




 Anything boob related.  Sucking them, nipple clips, titfucking.    Oh and spanking, enough to leave a good red hand print....on her.
