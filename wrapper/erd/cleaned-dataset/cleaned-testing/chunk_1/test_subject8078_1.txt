 I went from having ZERO ads on anything to ads appearing on Facebook, Twitter, OKCupid, reddit etc.  I personally haven't changed anything or any settings.  

I am able to use the "Block element" function to get rid of the sidebar ads, but the in-line ads in Twitter (Promoted by....) and Facebook (Suggested Post) still appear.  

Was there a new update that removed preferences?  Should I just switch to Ad Block or something else?

I am using the most up-to-date Google Chrome (Version 32.0.1700.107).

I am using the following extensions:

* Adblock Plus
* BugMeNot Lite
* Disconnect
* Ghostery
* Google Cast
* Google Chrome to Phone Extension
* Google Dictionary (By Google)
* Google Docs
* HTTPS Everywhere
* Imagus
* imgur Extension by Metronomik
* Jeffrey's Exif viewer
* Reddit Enhancement Suite
* Save to Google Drive
* Search by Image (by Google)
* SmartVideo For YouTube
* Stealthy
* TinEye Reverse Image Search

This is my first post in this subreddit, so please let me know if you need anything else!  

**EDIT:** I removed ABP and a few other extensions.  Then installed AdBlock.  Now everything looks normal again!  

I also updated a setting in Ghostery.  In the Options, under Advance, "Block new elements by default" was unchecked.  So I believe that allowed new trackers to sneak in.  Hopefully that won't occur anymore.  

Thanks for everyones help! 













































































































 The 2014 Hornets doesn't own the 19882002 history of the old Hornets.  


Do they own [this](http://media2.newsobserver.com/smedia/2013/07/13/20/27/899-W4GVU.AuSt.138.jpeg) Hornets design?  


If they wear throwbacks, will it be the Bobcats? Or what? 
























































































































































































































































































































































 Long time lurker, first time poster.

I searched around MFA and google first, but I need some additional help.

First off, I currently have a self-tie adjustable bow tie with thistle ends.  

I originally adjusted the tie to match my neck (like with my shirts), but I wasn't able to get a good knot.  When I folded the tie over, to form the knot, a thicker part crossed over.  So I increased it by 1.5 inches.  Is that fine? As long as I have enough fabric for a good knot? 

When I start out, I've seen a lot of places say you need to lower the left end 1.5 inches.  I usually match the right end with the concave dip in the left end.  Is that fine?

For a normal necktie, I know how to make it look good.  Good looking knot, with dimple, etc.  But what are some things to do to make sure my bow tie is a step above?  Should I have a dimple on both sides of the knot?  Should those dimples be symmetric?  

How about the back part of the ends?  There are the "front" ends, that everyone sees, then the back ends, which are behind the front ends.  Should/can they show?  Or is it like the skinny part of a necktie?  The bow tie I have has two different patterns on each side, so it wouldn't camouflage in.  I think it looks fine if a little bit of the back end is showing, but I don't want to commit a faux pas.

I'm going to a wedding with this, so I want to make sure everything is on point.  

One tip I've figured out is once you pass the tie through the loop and you're in the home stretch.  Then lightly tug on the single end on each side.  Then do the same thing with the double end on each side.  Eventually it will make the knot tighter and create the dimples.  

My apologies if I misused some terminology or whatnot.   






























































































 Assuming I don't have the original on my computer, I would need to pull it off of facebook. 




 The NCAA first had a University Division and College Division. The University Division became Division I and the College Division became Division II and III, in 1973.

In 1978 Division 1 divided into Division 1A (Football Bowl Subdivision) and IAA (Football Championship Subdivision).  

So each break made the club more exclusive.

Now we have the AQ conferences that at one time was 66 of the 120 schools in FBS (I haven't counted all of the new schools).

So are we going to a point where we will have an NCAA FBS "AQ" National Champ and NCAA FBS "non-AQ" National Champ, along with the FCS champs?

Let's face it, no team outside of the current AQs or the merged conference are ever going to win consistently.  

Or am I just talking out of my ass? 







































 The Farm and The Point are two covert CIA training facility. 

The Farm, [Camp Peary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Peary), is located near Williamsburg, Virginia.  This seems to be the main CIA training facility.

The Point, [Harvey Point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Point), is located in Hertford, North Carolina.  It conducts counter-terrorism courses that involve high explosives and ballistics.

So what are other grey/black places in the United States that aren't on the official maps. 




 The subreddits I'm subscribed to on reddit.com aren't on reddit is fun. My subreddits used to be on RIF.  What happened? 




 I have a few (if any) links that are all seven days old. Vast majority have around 20-30 points, none over 75.  I have my "links from:" option set to today.  WTF gives? Anyone else having issues? 





























 So lets say we have medication X that comes in two forms, instant and extended release.  For my question, lets say both are prescribed as 20mg.  I know the instant gives you the full 20mg dose of medicine X.  And I know the extended release has a part of it (usually half) in an extra coating to prolong the time for you to feel the effects.  

So the instant release has 20mg of active product, my question is how much does the extended release have of the active ingredient?  Would it be 10mg instantly, then 10mg in the coat?  Or 20mg instant and 20mg in the coat?  Or something else? 
 



















 For some reason I am still rocky with Redox reactions.  Every time I feel I get right to the cusp of getting it, something throws me off my game.  I know **OIL RIG** and **LEO GER**, and I have watched Khan (besides reading my chem books).  So is there anyway to look at a (pair) of molecules and know if they're reduced or oxidized?

To the second question.  I've been messing with [Glutathione](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) (GSH) and its partner [Glutathione disulfide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_disulfide) (GSSG).  So GSH is also referred to as L-Glutathione reduced and GSSG is also referred to as L-Glutathione oxidized.  So is having the Hydrogen always equal reduced?  And not having the hydrogen equal oxidized?  

So in other words HR (**H**ydrogen, **R**educed) and NoHO (**No** **H**ydrogen, **O**xidized)

Also going off that we have [NADPH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate) which is the reduced form of NADPH.  So NADPH, with the H, is reduced and NADP, without the H, is oxidized.  

Looking on wikipedia, they have another memory aid: "**LEORA** says **GEROA**"  Loss of Electrons is Oxidation (Reducing Agent) and Gain of Electrons is Reduced (Oxidizing Agent).

So with my GSH/GSSG example, GSH is the oxidizing agent (because it is reduced) and GSSG is the reducing agent (because it is oxidized).  

I apologize for the length of this, but I am at the point where I would be embarrassed to ask anyone (even though it is better to be embarrassed then not to know it).

Plus if anyone has any tips regarding this, I would love to see them! 
























 And today was the first day I took my prescription of Adderall (10mg).  What are some things I should look for or know etc?  The only thing I felt today was a warm feeling for a little while.

I read about the abuse (they have to give a pamphlet on it).  I am not worried about that.  

So any hints, tricks, or whatever I should know or look out for? 






















































 Obviously, Arrested Development was a beyond awesome show.  This show isn't on that level, but it is probably the best 30mins on TV currently.  

All "normal people" watch The Office (which sucks and is old now), and somewhat 30 Rock (which is awesome as well).  No one I know watch Community.  

God I hope the C word doesn't happen to them........ 




 It was simple animation/cartoon.  I remember a black background.  I looked on wikipedia for the name, but didn't see anything that stood out.  I can't recall though if this was the WHOLE show, or part of it.  I just remember it was a bunch of chemistry stuff on a VERY basic level.  Like I was around 5.   




 Come on Ira Glass, get off your ass and make some more free shows for me 


































 Just cause I like to troll doesn't make me a bad father 














 Facebook gave you the option to change your url to something you know.  So it now takes this form http://www.facebook.com/qwerty (whatever you chose it to be)

When you sign into facebook, type "qwerty", instead of your full email address.

It should allow you to sign in a little quicker.   




 I keep up with a few websites, but I have to randomly check on them to see if new information is posted.  They don't use RSS or anything like that.  Is there a program that could do that? AND if so, is there one that is free? 









 I used to use my mouse for everything, but after learning keyboard shortcuts, I've completely use the keyboard, outside of things where the mouse is faster.  I've actually developed a snobbery towards "mouse only user".  It is quite sad.

Some of the shortcuts I use:

Crtl C - Copu
Crtl V - Paste
Crtl X - Cut
Crtl T - new tab
Crtl W - Close opened tab
pgup - page up
pgdn - page down
Crtl Shift N - private browser
Atl Tab - Rotate between open windows
Crtl Tab - Rotate between tabs

I'm sure there are other ones I use, but don't recall the shortcut keys. 














 Isn't natural born via normal vaginal birth?  Has this ever been discussed?  





























 It is another cop show.  It started on NBC, but "moved" to TNT.  I really enjoy it and it seems "realer" than others.  I'm not a cop, but it is put together well.  The grittiness of it reminds me of The Wire.  I am afraid it is going to get dropped though..... 
































































 Sure there are some shitty programs on Discovery Health, but where will I be able to watch Dr. G: Medical Examiner, Medical Incredible, Mystery Diagnosis, Trauma: Life In The E.R. etc?  I don't care about anything Oprah does.
