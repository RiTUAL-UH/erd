 Besides airsoft I'm guessing you guys have different hobbies too, so what stuff do you guys like to do?

I like to play instruments with a small circle of friends, and we kind of have a band but it isn't anything too serious. I love to play guitar, and [I also collect guitars.] (http://i.imgur.com/5dlTnM2.jpg) 

To the left is my BC Rich Warlock. I paid about $700 for this guitar. 

To the right is my custom Jackson that a friend of the family rebuilt and repainted. This project was overall about $1000.   

Here's a [picture of my main guitar] (http://i.imgur.com/wZBJ1ja.jpg) that I play the most. It's a custom Fender Stratocaster that the same guy made custom tailored to my size, it has a scalloped neck because it's the most comfy way for me to play, and custom pickups that sound better while playing in the basement. This guitar was the most pricey at a cool $2,600. 

I also watch a shit ton of anime and play video games. 

Edit: Oopsy I also have a [drum set,] (http://i.imgur.com/VtsZo9a.jpg) but I don't play drums as much anymore. Usually I just teach my friend who plays the beats or what he needs to play. 

Wait what's that white part in the edge of the shot? Well we put a [black light] (http://i.imgur.com/bVMqn9A.jpg) above the drums for shits and giggles, then the white part is a [poster] (http://i.imgur.com/yLc842c.jpg) from an old school project. Put them together and you get something [kind of ominous.] (http://i.imgur.com/32HCzoD.jpg) Thought I'd throw this in because I thought it was funny.  




 I was just wondering what would happen if I put a few packages of 8x10 printer paper in my dishwasher. This got me thinking of intrusive thoughts. 

You guys got any good ones?  




 Is it just me or have the past few days been an ocean of self posts? 

I guess I can't complain because I just asked a question, but I don't flood the place with questions. 

I also made a few water puns in there, so if you sea what I did I'll be on my wave.  




 I've looked high and low on YouTube and forums for reviews of this gun, and I haven't turned up with much. I read a good review from Booligan about the gun, but otherwise I can only find reviews on the Marui Mac 10. 

Would this gun be worth getting with a few extra magazines for a bit of CQB fun, or is this gun too much of a hassle and a waste of time? Any input on the topic or other great AEP's would be great.  




 I just finished watching an anime called Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo so this is kind of a reference, but what color are you?

I think I'm orange. I am enthusiastic like yellow, and I like red. 

 




 [This is my current wallpaper and probably my favorite] (http://i.imgur.com/lUZpvyV.jpg)

[Next would be this.] (http://i.imgur.com/EvJJkaA.png) The resolution is kind of meh, but it doesn't look too bad. 

[Then this.] (http://i.imgur.com/ZFva2Cl.jpg)

As you can see all anime related, eh I don't really care. I would have one of my airsoft gun wallpaper [like this] (http://i.imgur.com/Db68anX.jpg) but I'm going to be using my laptop for school work and my school is very strict about looking at guns. I got banned from school computers for a year for being on Call of Duty Elite and building classes it's so bad. 
 




 Since it's almost 4:00 in the morning I'll count this for yesterday, but I peed in a Dr.Pepper bottle and filled it all the way up to the top. 

Your guys' achievements of the day? 




 I was just nominated by a friend, but I said no. Everyone got really upset, and I had to explain to them that I didn't care, and didn't want to get wet.  









 [Here's the image itself.] (http://i.imgur.com/0jEWYT7.jpg)

If you could make it slowly zoom in on his eyes, but with text like [this] (http://i.imgur.com/dhbi6dD.jpg) but have the text stay in the same place?

Edit: Pleeeeease? 









 This obviously isn't the case with every anime in the universe, but every one I've watched I've **loved** the opening songs. Are there any ones that suck? 




 He keeps telling me that he got "totally legit" m frames at a state fair for twenty dollars. Yeah. Right. 

But he keeps telling me he's going to wear them while we play and it pisses me off. He said he won't shoot them to test them out because he doesn't want to sacrifice his "good deal." 

To put it shortly, he's a dumb fuck who's going to go blind if I don't intervene. What do? 




 [The picture itself.] (http://i.imgur.com/kSqlAIb.jpg)

If someone here could make it vibrate, similar to [this] (http://i.imgur.com/bm7LeZr.gif) then that would be awesome. Thanks! 




 For me?

[Then] (http://i.imgur.com/l0AnGBO.jpg) and [Now.] (http://i.imgur.com/sYFX2tS.jpg)

*Cringe*
 









 I didn't want to share it with my camera guy loadout album on /r/airsoft, so I'll post a seperate album [here.] (http://imgur.com/a/T26Ny)

[Camera guy album I'm talking about] (http://imgur.com/a/HNjGu) 
























 At the end of [the .gif] (http://i.imgur.com/4EZuska.gif) it turns into a negative color scheme/filter. If someone here could just cut out that part that would be awesome. Thanks!

Edit: Sorry, where are my manners? Please..? 




 I probably don't have a favorite because I stumble on so many a day, but I'd have to say right now some of my favorites are, 

[This] (http://i.imgur.com/SJ7IuCg.gif)

[Then this] (http://i.imgur.com/pRbDVzL.gif)

[Maybe this] (http://i.imgur.com/GZzB4YT.gif)

[This] (http://i.imgur.com/yUeVFn2.gif)

[And this] (http://i.imgur.com/rcZxQb1.gif)
 




 I usually need to get rides from people to get to my shitty job. I've never liked working there, so when I couldn't get a ride tonight I said fuck it. 

This has been the first time in awhile I've felt like I was in control of what's happening to me. That job doesn't make me happy, so fuck it. It's not like they'll fire me for missing a day and not showing up. If they do, I don't care either because I hate it there.  




 I know, I know it sounds gay, ineffective, etc. but hear me out. 

I was thinking about my perfect comfortable/effective kit, and I was also thinking about solid color loadouts. Now one time with some friends we we're messing around and playing some pick up games after the day was over. At this point I had taken off my BDU pants, and put back on my usual **mens** skinny jeans (like that matters really.)

Here's the thing, they didn't really restrict my movement as much as I thought, and they were still comfy as fuck. 

Next, would be my next loadout choice, I want to try something different and do an all tan loadout. I know this won't blend well, but I don't really care. I usually push up and run anyways. The whole point of this is really, would khaki skinny jeans looks goofy with an airsoft kit? I don't think it would look that bad.  




 Since this is chat and shit I'm assuming this is allowed. 

My favorite color is orange. Style of red and enthusiasm of yellow.  




 I know that Pandora exists, but this song is from an anime so I was assuming I wouldn't be able to find anything in English with a similar style. [This is the song is any of yall are curious, I ain't ashamed.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDnB6Sjw9BM) 




 I mean I'm not going to kill myself, but Robin Williams killing himself got me thinking. I always thought it wasn't selfish, and never understood why people thought so. I just thought Robin Williams killing himself is proof that it isn't selfish, because he seemed so happy and healthy but he wasn't all along. Just proves how easy it is to put on a fake smile and pretend to be happy, I guess sometimes it's a part of the job.  




 So I got a pair of Condor Knee Pads that are very loose and I can't tighten them to my fit. I don't feel like getting out the sewing machine because, 

A. My skills are rusty.

and

B. I'm lazy and it'll look like shit because all I have is black thread (the knee pads are tan.)

So do you guys have any suggestions? I'm a small guy with small knees, and I need knee pads. I have some old Pro Tech pads from my mom because she plays roller derby and she gave me her old pads. I would use the Pro Techs but they don't look "totally uber oper8ter" enough for me. 

Edit: I'm checking out these [BLACKHAWK!] (http://www.amazon.com/BLACKHAWK-Advanced-Tactical-Knee-Pads/dp/B005GA7MWS/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t) ones but it sucks because I have no way of telling whether or not they'll work for small legs/knees. This is the case with all knee pads. 

 




 If someone had a nerf sword or capable melee weapon, do you think they could [deflect airsoft BB's like Kirito does with bullets in the series?] (http://i.imgur.com/oX2Ot96.gif)

I mean at certain distances you can see BB's coming just like the bullet paths in the show, so there must be a chance of it working? Just curious, it's not like I'm going to do it, just seems interesting to me.

Edit: Clarified stuff for clarity or some shit 




 I just got it again, while browsing Evike's new products today. Now I'm going to be eye balling [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/48746/) baby for awhile. I have a fuck ton of GBBR magazines piled up in my gear cabinet that I can put to use now too. 

This happen to any of you guys recently? 














 * It's my day off and I got up at 12:00 pm.

* My dad brought pizza home for dinner.

* Two of my good friends stopped over for a cup of coffee and to chat before pre-season football practice.

Turning out to be a pretty good for a rainy day!

[Part 2] (http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ckpo8/its_been_awhile_rdepression_i_just_need_to_thank/)

**We left off with me making a channel and starting to play airsoft again**

So I got about $1000 worth of gear because I don't go anywhere or spend money. The airsoft stuff ends here because I'm starting my tour of public fields with my friend when I get my license. Otherwise back to the girl of the story,

Things didn't work out with [neckbeard] (https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/10583843_830625146982733_3372155739179801587_n.jpg) and her. She almost turned to self harm, and I stayed up until five o' clock on the phone with her to calm her down. This was just mid July. We agreed to coffee and just catching up.

She told me about what happened with her and neckbeard. He insisted she dress up in public, and then he tried raping her but she beat him up. I came clean about losing my virginity, and then the unexpected happened. She started to cry. I couldn't help it either and I started to cry as well. The thing is, is that I love her, and she loved me. In the end I wish I would have lost my virginity to her.

Blah blah that's lame. We began hanging out more and by the end of July we were (and are) back together. Now it's going into August, the tenth is coming up! Now we hang out all day, and I might even ask if I can spend the night one of these days. 

Well that's the story of my struggle with depression, and how I fell in love and shit. This tenth will be the seventh month for me cut free! 
If you actually read all of this boring shit, then thanks. If not then it'll be archived and chilling out on the internet for people of the future to read.  




 **Where we left off something neckbeard guy blah blah**
[Link to previous post.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ckofd/its_been_awhile_rdepression_i_just_need_to_thank/)

Okay continued. 

Around January I forgot to mention I got a job as a dishwasher and this comes up a bit here and there but I'll get to that in a bit. Overall it helped me make friends, and try pot for the first time! (I don't use it all the time don't worry, like once a month at most)

Around April/May I started talking to my next girlfriend a lot more. She was so cold though. She never cared about me in the slightest. I wouldn't say I fell back into depression by any means, but I felt like I had to fight for my next girlfriends attention. I was willing to do anything to make her happy, that's the only thing that hurts a little.
She wanted to have sex, and I wasn't really comfortable. At the time I was willing to do anything and if she wanted to, "Bond bodies" or some shit, whatever. That's how I lost my virginity. To be flat out I thrusted and watched It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia until she said she was done. It was terrible... 

I broke up with her after that, and it only lasted two weeks. After that I felt neglected, used, and I was on the verge of hurting. At work things were getting better at least though. I wanted to cook, and one of my dreams was to cook. I was confused, I wanted money, and I didn't care about anything at this point. This next part of my story gets darker, and I think about it a lot.

Around May/June to move up I got the main dishwasher fired. He was already slow, but still fast enough to be proficient at his job. I knew he was from the town over, and got in trouble for being in possession of marijuana all the time. I told the police department about the pot he liked to hide in his hoodie sweatshirt that he always wore. 

He wasn't at the restaurant when they came, but the police barging into the restaurant was enough to get him fired. That's how step one of my plan went into action, I was lead dishwasher, and I got bumped up from $7.50 and hour to $8.25 and hour as the lead dishwasher. The only thing I thought about was how to become a cook at that point. 

One of the main cooks was barely a year clean from smoking crack and just getting back on his feet. His name was Warren. He had a free ride to college on a hockey scholarship and he threw it away to do drugs all day. The boss's son was one of the cooks, and was already teaching me things here and there in his free time. I was absorbing the information well. I was learning how to prep and how to cook from watching and doing stuff in my spare time. 

The hardest part was getting Warren to smoke crack again. I even hung out with him and the bosses son athis place. I tricked him, and I fucked with his head a lot. He'd still talk a lot about how it made him feel, or how amazing it was. I would entice him, and I would say things like, "It's human nature to do what you want," or "Sure it's unhealthy, but you'll be thinking about smoking it for the rest of your life."

This was about the end of June. I stay up some nights thinking about it. About how I'm a "sick mother fucker" or a terrible person. I didn't care. I wanted to cook, I wanted money, and Warren was in the way. They found him buying some in an alley a few towns over, that's what my boss told me. With that the position was mine, and I was bumped up to $9.50 an hour. 

With the money I was making I decided to get back to getting my license. My test is on the 6th and I'll probably get my license. But that has nothing to do with the story, I'm just happy! I bought a car from a friend of the restaurant for $500. A '98 Monte Carlo something something, I don't know. I'm not a car guy. 

I got back into airsoft, I got more gear and money, and I started up a channel with an old pal. I think I need to continue the story to part 3 but I don't know. Here's a picture of the bracelet she made me with my airsoft gear! It's the rainbow one on my left arm. http://i.imgur.com/twpx4QL.jpg

[Part 3] (http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ckqcd/its_been_awhile_rdepression_i_just_need_to_thank/) 




 So this is the story of how I got over my depression, and your guy's help in all of this, if you decide to read this wall of text then thanks!

It was the tenth of December, and I just turned 16 on the third. I didn't bother to get my license because I had nobody. I had a lack of friends, lack of motivation, and I just wanted to die. On the ninth I cut myself two times in the morning before school, and wore my favorite sweater to cover it up. When I got home I tried again. It felt like I had nothing more to do, and that was it. I was a hermit, and the only place I felt safe or happy was my room in the basement. I even bought a couch, and a bunch of instruments to occupy my time.

This was all on an old account, but I remember asking you guys about how to talk to people or get friends. I remember one of you said I should try talking to girls. This was weird because usually girls made fun of me and pushed me away. You guys said it would really help, and you were right! There was one person who really got me out of this, and of course you guys too :D.

I had been talking to and texting this girl from my science class for awhile beforehand, at least two months. She was really the only person who showed me genuine kindness at the time, and it felt amazing. I spiked up my hair like I like to do, put on my second favorite sweater, and got really excited. I asked her to go for a walk at her favorite place, the water tower hill. Eventually it became my favorite place to be too! She wasn't allowed to have guys over at the time so we met at the hill whenever we could. *Sorry for rambling on back to the story...*

So I remember rolling up my sleeves because it was either really hot outside, or I was nervous and really sweaty. Of course stupid me, I forgot about my cuts. When we met at the bottom of the hill she saw my cuts. I started to cry, a lot. I got embarrassed and almost ran away, that's how it always was when people saw my cuts or scars. But she grabbed my hand, it was a funny feeling and the first time I ever really held a girls hand. She told me it was okay and then she hugged me too. That was also the first genuine hug I had ever gotten (honestly my parents didn't/don't give two shits about me.)

When we got to the top of the hill, I asked her if she would think differently of me. I remember thinking, *why did I just ask?* and thought about the usual, "Well duh stupid emo" or something along those lines. No matter what I hope until the day I die, the way she smiled at me and said that it didn't matter. That it didn't change anything. That she really really liked me. I remember hugging her really really tight, and her hugging me really really tight, and it felt great. I wanted it to last forever.

The whole time we walked back to the bottom of the hill we held hands really tight. It was the first time I had smiled for more than fifteen minutes to be honest. When we got to the bottom of the hill she stopped and looked in my eyes like before. She said, "No matter what you can't never (her grammar is a little shotty at times but I think it's cute) ever hurt yourself like that again." I remember tearing up a lot, but I was still smiling. I agreed, of course I would! We hugged again and she was off to her house before her parents got mad.

The next few months we met up more and more. We talked at school **way** more than before too. She made me [this] () bracelet too so I'd, "Always be happy" and to remind me to never break our promise. Over January I met her parents, and even went bowling with them and stuff. They had excepted me, and I felt like I belonged. 

Fast forward to February, we were hanging out at her house and of course Valentines day was rolling around. It was to the point where everybody knew we had a thing, or were together. At that point we never really made it official, we just had a lot of classes together and we were always together if we could be. By the time Valentines day was upon us I asked her to go for a walk, and I asked her out at the top of the hill. (Cliche but I'm not creative so whatever lol) Then I had my first kiss! 

Over March though, things got bad. Her birthday was on the 13th, but I didn't remember it, I made an anti Semitic joke at dinner (turns out her father is Jewish), and we grew apart somehow. I felt sad, but I also didn't. As long as she was happy, and as long as we could still be friends. 

Over April she began talking to [this] (https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/10583843_830625146982733_3372155739179801587_n.jpg) neckbeard guy and we all hung out together a lot. I had moved on to a different girlfriend, but things weren't the same.  
 

I think I have to make a continued post sorry. 

Edit: I FORGOT A PICTURE OF THE BRACELET D:. Oh well on the next post. 
 [Part 2] (http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ckpo8/its_been_awhile_rdepression_i_just_need_to_thank/) 




 [So I decided to poop in a Cheezit box, yada yada. I need tips from you guys, please it's unbearable and my family is upstairs and I think they can smell it. I don't know, please.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2ck0iv/serious_pooped_in_a_cheezit_box_what_do_i_do_with/)

This is a casual conversation sub so hey why not. Right?

Edit: [:D] (http://i.imgur.com/8E3mB08.jpg) 




 I really needed to go and I had a *shitty* day so I thought it would give me a good laugh. I wiped with a sock, and it's also in the box. It smells really bad and the majority of my family is right upstairs in the family room. What do I do please help it's terrible. 

Edit: I tried pulling it out using a fly swatter like a little arm and broke open the poop and now the smell is just spreading even more please help it's in the corner of the room right now. 

Edit: The smell stopped spreading because I put a bag over it but for the time being, this is only a temporary solution.

Edit: I took it upstairs in an attempt to put it in the garage or something. My dad asked for a Cheezit, and then said, "Ah what the fuck dude did you fart?" and then I ran downstairs mumbling about moderator stuff for a subreddit. 

Edit: Someone asked for an update for his enjoyment, but this isn't really fun for me. My parents like to stay up late and I'm in a festering room of stench for at least three more hours. I put a scarf under the door so air doesn't escape. 

Edit: The bag on the box isn't blocking anything anymore. I have an old surplus gas mask but it's only been for decoration up to this point. I'm not sure if it will work. 

Edit: The mask is working a little bit, but it just smells like old books and rubber. 

Edit: My parents asked me to let the dogs outside and I'm afraid they'll figure out.

Edit: Forgot a period on the last update. 

Edit: I'm going to let the dogs out and take the box outside with me. I'll get the dog to eat it. 

Edit: Okay the dog ate the poop, but the box is still smelly. I wouldn't be able to put it in the garbage without the smell getting everyone's attention. 

Edit: What do I do with the box? My dad has a pool table and hangs out in the garage, if I put it in the garage garbage can will the smell go away by tomorrow morning? 

Edit: I took the box and put it in the street adjacent to our house. 

Edit: The sock is still in there.

 [CADPAT and tan gear, or ACU and tan gear?] (http://imgur.com/a/F31JL) 




 So a friend and I are doing a two man team sort of thing and we have our channel set up and everything. Now he already had ACU and I didn't want to make him buy a new pair of BDU's so I just got ACU camo too. I also like how it looks with tan gear so I was into the idea. 

But now I'm watching loadout videos on YouTube and gameplay and all of the poor, beginner, children, or noob loadouts include ACU gear of some kind. Did I make a mistake? [Here] (http://i.imgur.com/twpx4QL.jpg) is a picture of my current set up that I'll be running.

If it really is too bad I'll just get some Multicam BDU's for myself and then buy him some for his birthday so he doesn't have to buy any. Sure Multicam is average, but ACU is too. At least with Multicam we look a little better on the field. Right?

Edit: Fixed the picture 




 I got my new loadout a week early and don't have time to get down to the rock quarry for kit pictures so I'll just post my [head gear] (http://imgur.com/SjHnGff) for now.

**It goes as follows-**

Matrix MICH 2001

Matrix/Element Comtac II Replica

Revision Wolf Spider Goggles

Rothco Balaclava

Condor Tan Shemagh

Matrix or something half mesh mask

**The glasses are just for the picture I won't actually wear them in a game don't worry.** I didn't wear the mask in the picture because  I'm only wearing it when it's required. 

**Edit:** Formatting shit 




 So I just started watching Sword Art Online. Only the third episode and I'm crying dude. I'm already hooked to say the least. Otherwise I watch Eureka 7 and other shit. 

Edit: Just realized "animes" isn't the proper plural

Edit: 3:39 AM: Just watched Sword Art Online to episode 19 and might keep binge watching until I hear my parents wake up for work. Holy shit watch this show if you are reading this and haven't watched it. It is brilliant.  




 For me I just realized is probably waiting for new gear/guns to come to my house. Especially when it's a pricey order.  









 That is all. That made my day.  




 So I'm your average run-of-the-mill 16 year old teenage nerd dude. I just go about life right now working, and laying on the couch on Reddit. I want more, I really do, but I have one friend and nowhere to go. My only friend who's a girl, let's call her Allyson, is dating a douchey dude and she never wants to hangout now because of it. My only hobbies are watching anime, airsofting, and very seldom video games. The same song and dance. Every. Fucking. Day.

What really pisses me off is that all of the cooks at work patronize the fuck out of me even though I've been working there for eight months washing dishes for money to fuel the only hobby I have (I just watch anime online and shit, never bought anything.) One time the old pizza delivery guy even beat me with a mop. A fucking mop. I've been made fun of so much and hurt so much I just take it. I feel like an elephant at a circus every day. I can't quit or tell anyone because my dad is best friends with the restaurant owner. They all pretend to want to be my friend for shits and giggles too, and I've fallen for it twice.

The first time I went over to one of their houses with the Boss's son (Let's call him Vinny). When I walked up there were a bunch of older dudes (around 20) and all I did was stand there and wait for them to tell me to leave. I had no place there, and Vinny knew it. But no let's drag Tommy to Mitch's house just for shits and giggles. Only fun part was watching Mitch trying to pry his bong from his dog's mouth.

After all of this, I've been tricked and played. I just don't care. They poke and pry and tell me to "hang out" or shit. I just don't care. Even if something could be genuine I shrug it off. I've been broken. I've shrugged everything off lately. I've accepted laying here, drinking my coffee, with my eyes locked on this screen for at least five hours at a time. When I'm alone like this it's the only time I feel like I'm me. I don't know what to do, how to change, or who I am. 

This past eight months has changed me so much, and I don't know the real me. I sleep a lot and lucid dream because it's a great escape to be honest. I go to work at 5:00 pm so I just sleep until 4:00 pm so nobody bugs me. I then work and try to shrug off the hate as much as I can, and then I go home and cry. I cry for like a half an hour and then I sit on forums and shit until 4:00 am and then go to sleep and start again. 

My parents have noticed me changing now too and I'm afraid. My facial expressions have died, my sense of humor dulled, and I just don't feel like getting up. My parents have started accusing me of drinking or drugs. I don't even listen, I just drown it out so I can go back downstairs and be alone. The only genuine joy I've felt lately was three days ago when I went for a walk at the water tower hill where I used to walk with Allyson. I lied back in the grass and thought about how we used to watch clouds and she'd just say random things that she didn't even see. 

I don't know. I just don't care. I don't want to kill myself because it'll hurt. I've been 7 months self harm free because I promised Allyson I wouldn't because she's 10 months self harm free. Also, she made me this bracelet and sometimes I see it and think about her. But what do I do? What can a kid do when he's so broken that he doesn't know who he is. I don't care. That's all I can do.  









 I was just wondering, because this girl I like quit talking to me because I like airsoft and I like dressing up to play. But here's the kicker, she started talking to [this guy] (https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10430853_809480539097194_7650496038351710603_n.jpg?oh=e9dfa016be3761652c705cabbd718768oe=544D8B30__gda__=1413517241_5a9916b7dcf375335d8557da08511eab) who is probably one of the most cliche neck-beard cosplayers I've seen. What do you guys think? 



















 So I had nothing better to do when I got up at 1:00 pm, I went back to bed and set an alarm for 2:00 pm. When I fell asleep I first remember being in my room, and I got up and went to the kitchen. I told myself, "This is a dream, I can do what I want."

Then I heard gun shots and I saw a bad guy pretty far off, but near my house. I looked down and there was a sniper rifle in my hands. I shot the bad guy, and then I thought, "I wish my friend Alex was here."

"Hey Tommy we got two more out front," IT WAS MY FRIEND. NUH UH. 
So I shot one guy who was out front and another guy and then I went downstairs and my friend disappeared. Then I woke up. 

But the whole time I was aware of the fact it was a dream and I thought up the gun and my friend right? It felt like I was totally in control.  




 I'm too afraid to tell my parents, or my friends but I've been seeing things. It started about a year ago, and I've had this inner monologue thing. It isn't my voice though. It's a calm male voice, around the age of twenty. He just *narrates* and **narrates** with breaks every once in awhile. I've read up about violent voices and violent things and it's just this damn narrating. Hell it's even talking right now. I just call the voice Josh. In my Spanish class one time it was being particularly annoying and I couldn't help but yell out, "Shut the hell up."

Now Josh has kept talking and still does a lot. But three months ago is where it really gets scary for me. I was taking a walk at my favorite place near the town water tower. As I walked down the path I saw a white dog, and it was really furry. When I walked closer I clapped my hands a bit and said, "Come here" and then the dog just disappeared. It didn't vanish or like vaporize, it was just gone. 

What do I do? I'm too afraid to tell anybody and I'm afraid it will get worse. I'm only 16 and I'm really really really scared. I've heard of far worse cases and I'm afraid people will call me crazy or send me somewhere. What do I do? 




 I do realize how rare they are since they're discontinued everywhere and nobody seems to have one at all. Usually I am very against buying used guns and gear, but this is my last chance.

[Boom.] (http://i.imgur.com/7kNagaU.jpg)

[And why the fuck not?] (http://i.imgur.com/ZxI8EDo.jpg) 














 Are [these] (http://www.amazon.com/Military-Equipment-Paintball-Tactical-Multicam/dp/B00K7CP35S/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8qid=1405811555sr=8-10keywords=emerson+combat+pants) legit? 




 For years and even to this day I've had the same dream a few times a week and I've never figured out why. What happens is I'm stuck on my couch (I sleep on a couch instead of bed) and I can't move at all. Then two giant rat men walk into the room and look straight at me, and these guys are **really really** scary looking. 

At this point they both look at eachother and whisper something into eachother's ears. They look at me again and instantly materialize chairs in their hands, and take a seat. Then they sit there and stare at me. They just **stare** this terrifying death stare.

The only way for me to wake up is to whisper, *"Mom"* for a really long time three times and then I wake up in the position that I was in the dream. Arms right to my side, and looking right at the door.

Does this have to do with lucid dreaming? I think it must have something to do with it.  




 That is all. I just wish guys could wear hats with cat ears on them and shit. I think they're funny, and I also like how they look. I just wish I could without looking like I'm gay or an Asian chick.  




 I lost a friend on Xbox that I met while on a cruise a year or so ago. His name was Dmitri. He was seventeen years old. He was a really really nice guy and he was on his way home from vacation with his grandparents. He liked Minecraft, various animes, and he was planning on going to go to college to be an anesthesiologist. 

When I sent him some messages today wondering if he was up for some Battlefield 4 I didn't get a response right away. His mother replied and told me to join a private chat. Though her English was rough, she got the message across that her son had been on the plane. I told her that her son was a great guy and that I was sorry for her loss. 

I just wanted to share this so more people would know he was a great guy, and he was a human being who deserved more than this. Everyone on that plane was. 

Edit: lost not lose oops  




 So usually I've used my parents laptop or computer or the family computer for everything (I'm only 16). I built this laptop with the help of my uncle who loves computer stuff, and this is my first computer that's actually mine. 

Right now I am typing from the toilet, taking a shit while on a laptop, and buying the complete collection of Eureka 7 on Amazon. I haven't been this genuinely happy for awhile. 

Edit: Done pooping. Never used a laptop at all while pooping, this was my first time. Also, Eureka 7 complete collection coming next week. 




 I'm at about $2,500 or so since I've started if I roughly do the math.


JG AUG-$175.00

Echo 1 SOF 2- $260.00

Sniper My Mom Found At A Garage Sale- $50

Matrix M4- $280.00

WE Open Bolt M4- (On Sale) $260-something

Magazines for WE Open Bolt x4- $150



First Gear Order- $300

Second Gear Order- $250

Third (And upcoming kit) Gear Order- $500


So that's about.. $2,300 excluding shipping stuff. What about you guys? 
























 All I remember is this kid and this girl. The girl was somewhat mean to the boy and rode a scooter. Also it was in a city but it had to whole, "Can't leave my life sucks" vibe. PLEASE HELP.

Edit: FOOLY COOLY found it sorry  




 So I'm contemplating my next addition to the armory. I've always loved SCAR's, and I've always turned back to SCAR's when looking for a gun I truly want. 

When I was first thinking of GBBR's I almost got the WE Open Bolt SCAR-L. When I wanted to do a designated marksman loadout I thought of getting the VFC SCAR-H SSR. But out of all of these a SCAR-H really stuck out.

Since there isn't a GBB SCAR-H, the VFC isn't blow-back, and P* or Daytona Guns are out of the question I was immediately drawn to the [SCAR-H Recoil Shock by Tokyo Marui] (http://echigoya-guns.com/guns/index.php?route=product/productpath=36_35product_id=446).

How is the gun overall? I can't find many reviews, but from what I've seen it seems like a gun I can run for a really long time. Would it be good for medium range to longer ranges? I don't like to upgrade and would like a good stock gun. Anyways, any help would be awesome. 




 [I made this.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyl9rq_jVG4feature=youtu.be) 









 So I just watched the majority of Eureka 7: AO and I don't see why so many people hate it. Eureka 7 is my favorite anime, and Eureka 7: AO isn't that bad of a show either. Why does it get so much hate? 




 Just wondering if anybody here has taken cosplay to the next level and attempted a Simon "Ghost" Riley loadout from MW2. Now I know Call of Duty gets a lot of hate on this subreddit and in the airsoft community in general, but it's a very interesting kit to me. 

I have everything figured out to do a Ghost loadout and might order some gear and show up to the field in a Ghost loadout and surprise everyone. I just want to know if it's worth it or if I'll get made fun of. 









 I really want a side arm now, but I don't know what to do/get. I don't want a gas gun or a pistol, and I want something unique. 

I was thinking of maybe a shotgun, but shotguns seem cumbersome to carry. I was also thinking of the JG Scorpion, but I'm afraid that it will suck. 

One idea was the Tokyo Marui MP7 on a drop-leg holster but my dad won't order for me from overseas. 

Ideas? Help? 




 So after reading some stories here I thought this was another fun subreddit to come on and read some stories.

Well today I was talking to this girl I've been talking to for awhile. Usually she'll get hurt by some guy or something and I'll always be her shoulder to cry on blah blah. Well we've been good friends for the better part of the last two years and lately she seemed interested in me so I came up with a plan to ask her out.

So I call her up, ask how she's doing, and ask if she wants to go for a walk at our favorite place to talk. She says yeah, but she wanted to bring a friend. I say sure and I meet her at the top of the hill by the water tower like always. But as I was walking up I could swear I could here a guy's voice.

Whatever, keep walking it's probably just her manly friend Hannah. As I turn the corner to look and sit next to her like I always do that's when I saw her kissing some dude. I don't know who is he is and never did before. 

Now me being as awkward as I've always been can only mutter, "Hey um hi hey so sorry bye sorry." and run off in tears. But as I reached about half way down the road I stopped. I realized I don't give a fuck, and I don't care. I've been chasing her for this long, and have been lead on for this long. Why should I keep chasing? The dude looked like he was about twenty (we're both 16) so she'll get hurt anyways. 

Well thanks a lot /r/howtonotgiveafuck you really helped me with this and helped me realize how to not care.  




 I'll just paste it here quick, I need opinion on if this would be a good enough start to a short zombie survival comedy film. I'm not very good with formatting so bear with me.

**Scene 1
(Scene fades in and two people are seen. One slaving over a sink, the other drying.)**

**Tommy: (Wiping his sweaty forehead with his fore-arm)** Man...

**Dalton: (Turning to Tommy from his drying station)** When the heck do we get to leave? I have lonely videogames and soda waiting at home.

**Tommy: (Jokingly punching him)** Probably soon.

**(His boss walks in)**

**Vinny: (His voice is joking)** Hey **(whatever nickname he uses at the time)**, hey Dalton. Go sweep and mop the back, put that stuff away, and I'll have you out of here.

**Tommy: (His eyes light up)** Oh. Y-yeah! Okay. **(He grabs his towel and wipes his hands)**

**Dalton: (He goes to put away a container and drops it)** Dang!

**Tommy: (He picks it up and sighs. He goes to put it back in the machine)** Ah man.

**Vinny: (He grabs the container)** Hey it's fine, not like it'll start a super zombie pandemic huh?

**Tommy: (He laughs nervously)** Huh yeah probably not.

**(Camera zooms in as Vinny puts away the container on the stack of other containers. Their laughter is heard in the background as the scene cuts out abruptly. The title slams over the black screen)**


**Scene 2
(The scene cuts back in abruptly in a similar fashion as before. A text box that says, "3 Months Later" cuts into the scene just like the title. As the next scene plays out actors and music names will fade in. Tommy is sitting on a log at what appears to be a garabage dump)**
 









 I was looking at shotguns like I always do because I've always dreamed of a Zombie Survivor kit. Anyway, I was looking and I want an M870 because they are more survivor-esque and more civilians have them than M3's. 

But I've come to realize most shotguns are either single shot M870's by GP or Tri-Shot M3 variants by Matrix, JG, blah blah all the same. 

Why haven't they made a **SPRING** tri-shot M870? 




 So for fun I started a band with some friends, and it's gotten a little more serious. We need some sort of logo but I have no clue where to start because of our name. Our band name is The Real Crime Stoppers, just because we thought it was funny. How would I make a logo or symbol for that? I have no clue where to start. 




 So when I order my new gear I'm going to do a helmet, goggles, and half mask combo with my headset. [Here] (http://imgur.com/tTpNJvH) is something I threw together in photoshop to get it planned out. What do you guys think? I want to paint a design on the half mask, and I planned on doing the [Smiling Titan's mouth] (http://x3.fjcdn.com/comments/Nothing+scares+people+more+than+teeth+that+arent+supposed+to+_9e1b288a22ff818decbda3a985965229.jpg) from the Attack on Titan series because it seemed unique and cool.  




 Would I be able to take [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/46036/) mount and stick it to a mask to use a GoPro? 
























 I'll just make this a text post. Over the next few days just submit stuff here for the banner art. Otherwise, it's almost complete. 




 I'm pretty dead set on getting this camo for my next kit, and was wondering if any of you guys use it. I searched the sub and couldn't find anything. If anybody has pictures of how it looks with tan gear that would be cool.

edit: [What it looks like] (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/GWB_choc_chip_camo.JPG) 














 Tango down 




 DAE? 




 So with my drivers test around the corner I'm going to look for public fields. One field that got my attention was [Black Ops Airsoft] (http://www.blackops-airsoft.com/index.html) in Zion, Illinois. 

Has anybody been to this field? If so, how is the gameplay, area, or overall how the field is? Also one more question, I have a list of must haves if I'm going.

**1. Mask-** I'm getting [this mask] (http://www.evike.com/products/44222). Is mesh stuff okay? If not I'll just get a Dye mask or something.

**2. Gun Case-** I know I'll need to get a case, so I'll make sure to get that.

**3. Barrel Condom (hehe)-** This is what I see people put on their guns in videos at public field, so would [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/24715) suffice?

**4. Lastly, Dead Rag-** I'm assuming any old piece of red cloth would do, but I'm getting one with the Evike logo just to represent.

**5. New Spring-** So I'm getting a new [spring] (http://www.evike.com/products/31455/) since my FPS is really high on my gun. Will I be able to just throw this bad boy in my gun and be good to go?

Otherwise, I think I got everything down and I'm ready to go once I order everything. Am I missing anything?  




 So I've been seeing a girl for at least a year, and we just decided to make it "Facebook Official". I feel comfortable enough with her now and I want to believe she's the one. I'm only seventeen right now, and I would be totally content without being sexually active, all I really want to do is cuddle and stuff.

So we were hanging out today and she brought up the idea of sex. I thought, "Well that would be fun." I care enough about her to give her my virginity. But should I? She really really wants to at this point. I'm up for it, but I don't know if I should. I've never been in a relationship where I didn't bring up the idea. 

She said something about wanting to, "Bond our bodies physically," and "Become closer" or something. She's also 17, but not a virgin. Should I go through with this? Will it jeopardize anything? I'm totally blind on the subject and have no clue what to do. HELP.  














 I've seen a boat load of reviews of the older versions of this pistol, but not many reviews on this gun. Would it be worth the money? I need to pick up my first side arm and I really want a pistol. Thoughts? Concerns? 

[The gun itself] (http://www.evike.com/products/45591). 




 This is my current set up I'm going to be running for the better part of this summer. I've always loved the look of the average PMC kit so I went in that direction. Please excuse the tactical skinny jeans, I just got off of school and at the time I took these pictures and I was as giddy as a child on Christmas. Don't fret, I use eye-pro, I just left them at a friends house. For the purpose of picture, I thought my casual prescriptions would be fine. 

[FUCK WHEN EVER I TRY TO FORMAT PRETTY THE IMAGES ARE TINY SO HAVE AN ALBUM OF THE PICTURES NORMAL] (http://imgur.com/a/ArEwK)


**KIT LIST FROM TOP TO BOTTOM**

**Hat-** Basic tactical cap from Condor

**Patch-** Sassy MilSpec Monkey patch

**Comms-** Just a basic Element headset

**Shemagh-** Basic black and white Condor shemagh

**Jacket-** Just a Condor Softshell Jacket, nothing special

**Patch-** Hazard PVC American Flag Patch

**Chest Rig-** No name brand I added to the cart 

**Dump Pouch-** Just a Condor Drop Leg dump pouch

**Knee Pads-** Standard Condor quick release knee pads

**Sling-** GP sling plate, came with a one-point sling

Other than that I'll probably just get some Khaki's or some blue jeans to finish off the kit. 

**GUN**
It's a bone stock WE Open Bolt M4 I posted a little while back with a previous kit. I run four magazines right now, but plan to get at least six more (I'm very trigger happy.) Otherwise I hope you enjoyed my kit, and I tried to keep everything as detailed and nice as possible.  




 So the JG AUG uses a standard version three gearbox if I'm not mistaken. Would I be able to just take it out and drop in a [KA Version Three Gearbox] (http://www.evike.com/products/37365/) into the gun without much trouble?  




 So during the recent time I airsofted I couldn't wait to field my brand new WE Open Bolt M4, but there's one problem... It was too cold. 

It never occurred to me and I ended up just filming and taking pictures. But now I want a new AEG for when it is too cold out for my GBBR, and so I won't miss out on the action.

So I've narrowed down my search to two guns. My price range with everything I need to play is about $500.00 to $650.00.  I just want a gun that is guaranteed to work, that will last me awhile, and will have good performance at short to medium ranges. 

My first choice is the [VFC SCAR-L] (http://www.evike.com/products/45160). I've always loved SCAR's and I've seen just about every review on this gun drooling over it. 

My second choice would be the [GG GK-5C] (http://www.evike.com/products/44551/). I know this a newer gun to the airsoft scene, and I couldn't find many reviews on it. Has anybody used this gun/know anything performance wise or durability wise? It looks like a solid gun that I'd enjoy, and that would be pretty reliable. 

Any help would be nice, I'm not trying to be a bother at all with a bunch of questions.  




 I have a shit ton of friends who smoke pot, and I'm kind of curious. About half of those friends have become fuck ups, and half are perfectly fine. Most of the people I work with at a restraunt smoke pot, and they are all fuck ups though. I don't want to end up working as a dish washer for my whole life. 

I'm sixteen if that matters. I know that it won't magically transform me into a fuck up, but will I change at all if I do smoke pot? I really want to know what it's like, and I'm a 4.0 student, so I don't think indulging will effect me in any way. 

My dad said if I were to it's like alchohol, some people can handle it and some people can't. Is that the case? I need advice ASAP, because I was gonna ask a friend who frequently smokes if I could try it with him one of these days.  









 I want to go for an MK18 build, but have a few questions on barrel length. Would I have to buy a shorter barrel for the gun? Right now I have a standard WE Open Bolt M4 and I thought the barrel was 14.5 inches, does this mean a new barrel is in order?  




 I don't want to spend a lot of money on a rail system for my WE Open Bolt M4, but I really want a rail system. Is it true that the Daniel Defense Omega 7 inch rail system is compatible? 

[Rail system itself] (http://www.evike.com/products/31496/) 














 [The channel itself] (https://www.youtube.com/user/lonesofterhalberd).

After researching I finally got it to fit like I wanted in the art area. I know it's a little grainy, and I might fix that later. Just decided to get my channel fired up for the nicer weather and ready for airsoft footage. I decided to go with my main logo color and try to selective color it a bit, a little cheesy but I think it's pretty nice. Thoughts?  




 Will [this stock] (http://www.evike.com/products/42150) fit on the WE Open Bolt M4? Also, are there any guides on how to take off the LE stock that comes with the gun? 









 I was curious how many of you guys have Zombie Surivial-esque kits, or apocalypse kits? I was thinking of starting one, since my first main loadout is complete.

Also, would a Vietnam Era M16 have a place in any of these kits? I want an excuse to buy the WE Open Bolt M16 VN, but I don't want to make a VN kit.  




 So I'm investing in a nice kit and I was looking at TACO Pouches, the single rifle magazine ones to be exact. I saw a video on a YouTube channel and they shook the chest rig around and the magazines didn't move, but I'm still not convinced. 

With TACO pouches will I be able to run around, slide, sprint, jump, and roll with my magazines in these pouches? I want to get pouches to protect my magazines since they are like thirty dollars a pop.  




 So I recently bought my first real primary weapon, and being that all of my disposable income goes into airsoft, I now have enough money for a sidearm. 

So there's one pistol I was wondering about, and couldn't find many reviews on. The [WE 3.8 Compact] (http://www.evike.com/products/41759/).

Now I've had great luck with WE GBBR's so far, but I've heard of problems with their pistols. For the price, this gun looks pretty and for the price seems nice. Thoughts? 




 *Ten Years Ago Today 




 Here are the questions,

**1.** I heard [this rail system] (http://www.evike.com/products/31496/) is compatible. Is it? 

**2.** As for upgrades I was only going to buy the RATech NPAS kit and Trigger Box. Anything else I should invest in? 

Edit: No picture, it was messed up. 




 Very very excited to enter the realm of GBBR's so here's [the kit itself.] (https://imgur.com/a/Cbrfl)

Kitlist:
[Gryffon Golem Chest Rig] (http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?products_id=15135)

[Gryffon Dragon Spine Belt](http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?products_id=15137)

Otherwise the other stuff from my kit was bought from tactical gear trade but I don't recommend ordering from that website. Overpriced, shipping was high, and took a long time. 

The gun itself is a WE Open Bolt M4 totally stock. I plan to upgrade with an NPAS and new Trigger Box. Otherwise I might get an RIS and crane stock. 

Edit: Buncha formatting crud

**Warning Potato Pictures** 




 To begin, I was **very** hesitant to order from Evike given all the horror stories I've heard here. I have to say, my whole experience has been very enjoyable. 

To start, I wanted the WE Open Bolt M4. I would usually order from ASGI, but they do not stock as many guns as Evike, or at least in the GBBR department. So after researching I didn't want another AEG, so to Evike.

At first there was a problem with our credit card (My father's credit card of course, I gave him the money and he deposited it etc.). When he was on hold for over five minutes I was certain it would be a grueling affair. Somebody picked up right away and a young man named Michael described the problem very politely. We just needed to raise our limit on the card and the gun was ordered!

Now another con I heard about with Evike was that you had to pay for shipping, but the price wasn't even that much. It was only twenty five in shipping for a gun and everything I needed to skirmish. After ordering I was informed the next **morning** that the gun was shipped. Within three or so days I got the gun. Only three days was how long it took, even with the cheapest shipping. With ASGI it was two weeks before I got my gun, and the shipping was free. Even though it's free, two weeks seems like a long wait. 

All in all, everything I've heard about Evike is wrong and my experience was very enjoyable. 10/10 would order from Evike again, and I'm not ordering from ASGI again. 

Edit: It took no longer than ten minutes for our call to be transferred. 




 I'm writing a persuasive paper on why airsoft should be offered as an extra curricular acticity in school. Now all SB199 or whatever or kids being shot by police stuff aside, what would be some good points to make? I figure it's fun and helps with team building and friend stuff. Any tips? Any other points I could use?  




 So I've been contemplating a new addition for my armory. I LOVE the look of a SCAR-H but there are no GBB SCAR-H's and I don't want just another AEG. 

So if I were to buy a VFC SCAR-H and buy a P* engine for it, what do I need to buy? I have a list of a few things, if somebody could fill me in on the mistakes that's be great.

[Engine Itself] (http://www.evike.com/products/37091)

[Tank] (http://www.evike.com/products/36570)

[Air Tube System Thingy] (http://www.evike.com/products/40898)

[Battery for FCU] (http://www.evike.com/products/37904)

[Charger] (http://www.evike.com/products/30777)

As for the [gun] (http://www.evike.com/products/32613) I was planning on ordering it before-hand separately with magazines and BB's. Is my checklist complete? Any help from seasoned P* owners would be awesome. 
 




 I'm just a dude in highschool with a few quick questions. So I just asked this girl on a date that I've been talking to for awhile. How much money should I take with me? Like average movie price, and a nice dinner? Also, would we go to dinner then movie or vice versa? Or does it not really matter?  




 I'm pretty set on getting a JG Scorpion, and to increase effectiveness, I thought doing a LiPo mod for the gun would be beneficial. 

I've seen somewhere around here a guide on how to modify the gun to take a 7.4v LiPo. Could anybody dig it up or point me in the right direction? 




 Will [this holster] (http://www.evike.com/products/34450) work with a P99? 




 As for any new subreddit I'd like to lay down a few quick rules.

* Read the Side Bar
* Read the Stickies
* **Don't be a dick**

Otherwise have fun, post away, and spread the word!
The whole reason reason I made this subreddit is because in Wisconsin, and the surrounding states airsoft isn't very... Alive.
Well here in Southern Wisconsin there are a few teams trying to make a difference and really spread the love of the sport. So spread it, play, subscribe, and have fun!

 Is ranger green, sage green, and smoke green the same thing as foliage green? 




 For my primary weapon I'm deciding on the [WE SCAR L] (http://www.evike.com/products/36555) and for my secondary weapon something a [little unconventional] (http://www.evike.com/products/25041).

Thoughts? Concerns? Any tips or information I should know about?  




 So I have a six hundred dollar budget, and I want to jump into the GBBR world. The WE seems like a really good choice out of thr box, and of course I'd get upgrade parts from RAtech and such. I've been on Arnies Airsoft, Airsoft Society, and a plethora of forums to find reviews. I've also watched every review on YouTube. At this point I'm pretty dead-set on this gun.

Now with six hundred dollars will I have enough for the gun and magazines? If so, how many magazines should I buy? I usually play thirty minutes games at our friends private field, with short breaks for reloading and drinks.

Next quick question, anybody with past experience, what parts should be replaced? Delving into a whole new type of airsoft rifles is pretty confusing. All over I've heard, " RAtech, RAtech, RAtech."

HELP /R/AIRSOFT! 




 Will the [WE SMG 8] (http://www.evike.com/products/43558) fit in [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/38605/) holster? 




 I've read about every review on forums, and have watched every video. At this point, the Vector seems like a reasonable choice for my next order. 

The problem is that every review gives the same information. Usually it's the, "Feels great" and "Really realistic." If I wanted to use this gun for field play would it work? If not, would the Angry Gun power-up silencer be a good choice for field play? 

I have a friend that uses the KWA MP9 with no upgrades for field play, and he fares pretty well. Noting that, the Vector seems like a sensible choice for a unique GBB SMG for field play. 

Does anybody have any information, reviews, or help on whether or not this gun is good for field play? 














 Best battery option or what battery for the VFC SCAR-L? 




 Pretty much it They are a huge part of many Japanese paintings, early Japanese art, and even anime today, but never the fruit itself. As far as I know I've never really seen much Japanese cuisine with cherries.
