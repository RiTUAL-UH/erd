 yes but those movies are shit  




 also has the same actor on there  




 The Walrus fight from Tusk  




 that was probably the most shocking thing I have ever seen in a theater oh man those screams tho and the brief glimpses before we were given our first look.  




 Oh well your loss  




 Yeah its more comedy than horror but there are some truely terrifying and creepy moments.  




 Yeah even when they showed the little glimpses and his horrible screaming I was like WTFFF.  




 Yeah I noticed the fake CGI right away and just thought it was someones cool new video but then they said it was supposed to be real so I was like oh.  




 Holy hell how did I not notice that!!!!!  




 LOL  




 HAHA they make a joke about that in the film  




 AMEN  




 See it in the film itself the buildup and reveal is so messed up I cringed when I first saw it.  




 Hes not TOO obvious tho most people might recognize his voice and eyes but thats it. He was freakin hilarious in it LOL  




 Just saw it wow WTF was that LOL so funny and terrifying at the same time I LOVED it cant wait to see it again!!!!! That walrus was scary looking LOL and Johnny Depp oh man was he great in this!!!!!  




 OMG yes I cringed when I first saw it and I rarely do that with movies.  




 Then watch it and have it explained for you  




 Because they r awesome!!!!!!!  




 LOVE that scene!!!!!  




 WOW I did not know that.  




 Thats what caused me to start the thread LOL  




 What are some movies that are an actors last film appearance ever and in their last scene they die in it??  




 Boring, artsy, and not enough Hulk.  




 sounds cool.  




 Avatar  




 Looks pretty good cant wait to see it also hope it gets some award recognition.  




 she didnt want to reprise a role that she earned a razzie for LOL.  




 Yeah she would have been apart of one of the biggest grossing movies ever. She chose to do mad whatever tho.  




 It was a good movie I kinda got confused at some parts but I loved tom and james performance RIP BTW. It was a good crime drama.  




 GOD YES THIS BETTER BE TRUE!!!!!!!!!  




 What is the origin of this term??  




 Just keep reminding yourself that it is NOT real just a movie with actors and a director.  




 Memento the first time I saw that movie I was blown away now everytime I rewatch it while still good it lacks the shock factor or whatever.  




 Not a good way to phrase it LOL but if she likes those kind of movies than why not!!!!  




 Hellboy 3  




 Yeah thats what I was thinking it would explain a lot.  




 Interesting theory how have I not noticed this yet.  




 They should just have a renner damon teamup movie.  




 Ah man I was gonna say that one, but yeah thats true.  




 Daniel day Lewis in Lincoln to me that was just WOW how he recited all of those monologues and stories while still doing a perfect lincoln accent so awesome.  




 Yeah but most of it is based on other unknown facts that I am not familiar with like if it bombs he will have lost a lot of money.  




 maybe  




 Yeah thats what I was thinking I also read somewhere that frank the rabbit was sent by some invisible gods or something to fix the timeline.  




 I Am Legend  




 now that is a good one I remember downloading the script and reading some of it it was genius. Too bad it will likely never be made be nice to see stallone behind the camera only and to see him do a pure drama biopic.  




 I love that movie!!!!  




 Yeah thats what I think too so a brooklyn accent.  




 I always wanted to use one of those but I never did.  




 Like what are some things that seem perfect for someone but will likely never happen because of one person being a jerk ie Steven Seagal is perfect for the expendables franchise but will never appear because of his beef with avi lerner.  




 I cannot stand hardcore girlie movies like the sisterhood of the pants or the yaya sisterhood. Also directtodvd kids movies. Anything else tho I generally like oh yeah except crappy b movies like the ones steven seagal does nowadays.  




 Yeah I love that movie I remember how scared I was when I first saw it.  




 Yes  




 Dam she has an oscar I forgot and she hasnt put it to good use yet either.  




 Ig u havent seen Ghostbusters then it would be an amazing experience to watch it in the theater brand new!!!!  




 Its all about the benjamins for him, it is really sad cuz I think he does great in drama and he should do it more but all he does is shitty comedies all the time.  




 Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln in the movie Lincoln also Heath Ledger in the Dark Knight.  




 I would feel like a horrible person. 




 yeah that one  




 that movie that Marion Cotillard won an oscar for.  




 that one doesnt count cuz the thread is about heroes and villains who only meet once.  




 good one  




 Yeah that POS was released in theaters.  




 Man i wish that had a sequel just to see Sinestro as a villain anyways.  




 Yeah I love snowpiercer and why did I just realize that one?? Interesting.  




 Movies where the hero or protagonist only meets the villain once in the entire film.  




 Who would be cool in a film version of the book carte blanche?? Just for fun.  




 What are some perfect film collaborations that never happened??  




 UGG I HATE it when he drinks, it is SOOOO annoying!!!!!!  




 Like I will move either my leg or arms for something and they will make a creek sound, kinda like a floorboard. Why does it do that??  




 My BMI is 31 and I weigh 244 Lbs I want to get my BMI down to a healthy weight which is 184 so I want to lose 60 pounds at least. How can I do this without getting dangerous I dont care about the time either.  




 like regular actors who donet usually do comedy but r actually very good at it, like van damme on welcome to the jungle.  




 Go the hell to bed now!!!!! You have literally been sitting there for 13 freakin hours!!!! Give someone else a shot on the tv now!!!!  




 When you are expected to do something do it!!!!!! Dont just blow it off and ruin someone elses whole day do what is expected of you and also get off the dam couch for at least 30 minutes!!!!! God I HATE people who do that!!!!!  




 I sleep 8 or 9 hours a night band I am 22 years old but why do I yawn all day everyday??? Is there something else?? I wont feel tired at all but I still yawn.  









 I just mean actors not actresses because we all know what they did to get famous LOL, Like just guys who have no acting skills or anything but still get roles for no reason.  




 Its my soda god damit go get your own!!!!!! I only have a little and it is for ME noone else!!!!! Jesus christ if it was yours I would have said it is mine and yours, I dont care if you raised me it is MINE.  




 UGH I HATE when people randomly drink my god dam soda like they dont even care!!!!! I am on a budget and I cant afford to keep buying them damit if it isnt yours dont touch it!!!!!!  




 So I live with my dad and me and him were never really close I am more close to my mom and sister but I live with him because he lives close to where i work and I dont have enough money to get my own place yet. Anyways it is a one bedroom apartment and he sleeps in a bed and I sleep on an old military cot we both take turns on the tv and stuff but sometimes I wish I just had my own space!!!!! He is also kind of an ass sometimes, earlier today he assumed I was gonna go stay with my mom and sister for the weekend and I didnt correct him, then when he got home that evening he said "I thought u were gonna go with them" Then I responded " I never said that" He responds with "yes you did" UGH I HATE when people put words in my mouth that is one of my pet peeves!!!!! GOD I need my own place again!!!!! When I leave I will never call or visit him again that is the truth.  




 I have always wondered how do they know which bullets came out of what kind of gun???  




 I mean something along the lines of Daniel Day Lewis when he played Bill The Butcher who hated Abe Lincoln but eventually went on to play him, stuff like that.  




 I recently realized that I have crooked ears by almost a thumbs width. Why did this happen to me??  




 Whenever I hear the term inflation like for how much a movie has grossed and stuff I always wonder what it is???  




 Wat r some good ones where someone is first billed but they have very little screentime??? 




 I remember watching an episode of johnny bravo where he finds something and there is the sound of a choir and you think it is in his head but it actually was a choir singing behind him and he tells them to cut it out cuz that is annoying. Anyone know which episode that is???  




 A long time ago I remember watching this movie with my parents about a group or guys who defend a fort or something in the middle of the desert there was the main guy who may or may not have been played b Jean Claude Van Damme. There was also a black guy who gets captured by the enemy and a guy who gets an eyepatch over the course of the movie. At the end of the major battle it is just the main guy and the eypatch guy left, that is all I remember. Anyone know???  




 Like do u always get snacks if so what?? Also is there a favorite place u like to sit in the theater??? For me I always get snacks usually just popcorn and a drink but for longer movies I get candy too which I usually sneak in LOL. I also like to sit in the middle of the theater that way I dont have to crane my head.  




 What kind of film career would he have had?? God I wish he had lived I assume he would have been in The Expendables at some point.  




 I have always wondered what does having a mortgage mean???  




 What are some uncredited roles that are more than a cameo I mean a full fledged supporting role that was never credited for some reason.  




 Also what do u feel when u get scared, or startled??  




 Basically she is a few years younger than me and we used to go to the same high school and we r facebook friends and I really want to ask her out, but I dont know how I never see her around town and I dont want to ask over FB that sounds lame, I did look her up in the phonebook and I know her address and home phone number but I dont want to use those as it would be too stalkerish. What should I do???  









 What are some good ones???  




 I know an author gets an advance or something with a publisher but exactly how does this work??  









 I remember seeing a foreign commercial with all of the horror icons and stuff just outside doing normal things. Like Freddy Krueger, Michael, and Jason although I forgot what they were doing but I do remember Chucky was on a pogo stick bouncing around. It was all in live action.  




 I am considering reading 2 hp books at the same time. I am reading HBP but I also want to read GOF. I am just wondering if I should or not. Has anyone ever done this before?? LOL 




 I am just curious what other actors would u guys have seen in other roles. I for one think Bob Hoskins would have made a fine Horace SLughorn. Any other ideas??  




 A long time ago I watched the ending of a movie which had Men in Black as villains, I mean they were also aliens but they had big alien eyes that they would hide with sunglasses and they had white blood I believe. I also remember a bunch of the men in black attacked a house at night and tried to kill people.  




 Im sure this has been asked for but what if Tim Burton and Michael Keaton had returned for Batman 3 I think it would have been pretty amazing actually. I liked the first 2 and It is sad that they only made 2, thoughts???  




 A few years ago I walked in on my friend watching netflix and he was watching some movie that I have no idea was but it seemed intriguing. It was the very end of the movie and a prisoner got a letter in a jail cell and as he read the letter with a voiceover of the kid who wrote the letter, he was poisoned or something and the guy just dies there in his cell with some kind of poison that was on the letter I believe.  




 When I was younger I used to watch this anime show about some guy named Tenchi I believe he lived in the forest with a bunch of girls and one of them was nemed reoko or something like that. I remember he would fight people with a sword too.  




 To me some of the worst movie lines ever have to be on Taken 2 "look a flip flop" or "I just shot some guy". Another one was After Earth "my suit is black I like it but I dont know what it means". What are some others???  




 title  




 Like a relative or something.  




 Like a movie where there is no actually villain or antagonist for the heroes to fight it is just them against the clock or something like Inception.  




 I know there is Nicky in The Bourne Ultimatum and Angel in XMen First Class but r there any other ones where there is a character who doesnt talk after like halfway into the movie??  









 Like when a british person is playing an american and in the movie they "pretend" to be british and then revert to their real life accent. Any other country would work too like Australian, or Irish or german.  




 Every time I try to use Hola unblocker to watch netflix it takes me to the page but it never fully loads. Does this happen to anyone else?? Also what is another program that does the same thing as Hola???
