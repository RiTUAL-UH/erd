 Deadly Premonition 2: The Deadcoming 




 Japanese Hard Dance is so under exposed (which is sad because it's an awesome scene!) and for anyone interested in speedcore check out M1dy

Edit: also if your interested in hardcore checkout Kobaryo, his song clock control is great 




 Awhile ago I really didn't like speedcore... Now I like it, anyways RWC dose some good stuff and I would recommend checking out some of his terrorcore   extra tone if your feeling crazy :' ) and if your not feeling crazy don't worry he also dose hardstyle under the name shingo DJ 




 I'm a little sad this release isn't hard dance but I am sooo happy Mat's back!

 Hardcore for life 




 Get this song for free from the DL's in the description then play dark souls so you can engage in jolly cooperation while you listen! 









 Get this song for free form the DL's in the discription and then play dark souls so you can engage in jolly cooperation while you listen!  




 Baebii :D 




 Ohh... Maby A fine romance by frank or some where beond the sea by Bobby Darin  




 The sad thing is this could actually be a thing that you would see pop up on your news feed 




 I totally forgot about gammer! Also I've never heard that song before so thanks! 




 Oh sweet!, I thought it was that guy he killed... 




 I'm a huge gabber/hardstyle/hard trance head and I've been getting into happy hardcore lately so please give me some suggestions! The only people I know of right now are Rhythmics, Nanobii, S3rl   Matduke 




 What's woolie supost to be? 




 Some one please make a video where all the pics are of woolie/grandma swamp 




 Dude I know, I was reading it and the whole time I was like ":(" the I saw the familiar vegtiable at the end of the article  




 Look closer at the website... 














 He responded to my message on FB and said that it might be hard for him to do because he doesn't really have a method. I for one would love to see how he made the kick from sounds of the machine if he dose decide to make one  














 Just think about it, hiding from lickers in lockers, running away from 2 hunters instead of the twins and of course nemesis would replace walker  
























 Recently I've been listening to a lot of speedcore, terrorcore .etc stuff I told my self I would never enjoy when I started listening to hard dance. As you can tell by the title that has all changed, so please link me the most fucked up stuff you know! 









 I get most of my hardstyle from the yearly Cloud 9 hardstyle compilations (10$ = 100 songs, great deal) recently I found out about the 2014 compilation and to my sadness I already own two of the songs on the compilation (God said 2k14   Reality) are there any songs that grab you as must haves? [iTunes link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/hardstyle-top-100-2014/id893210852) 









 This February me and my friend will get up on stage in front of 500+ high school students and play a 20 min DJ set. He will be doing 10 min of house and I will be doing 10 min of hardstyle, since most people at my school haven't heard of hardstyle I'm going to do a euphoric set as opposed to a raw one. With that in mind I want my set to be the best euphoric, harmonically mixed gateway into hardstyle ever! Even though I have a lot of euphoric stuff I still want to hear from you guys, so please link me some of your favorite euphoric tracks. Also, producers.... Do you have a track that you think 500+ first time hardstyle listeners would love? Well link me some of your stuff and I'll see what I can do to get your song in my mix :) 


































 I think someone could get a lot of mileage out of doing a parody of music production like by referencing modern talking in massive, vengeance sample packs, pirating and other things. FL Studio would probably be the best choice for this but it could still be funny in other programs like ableton, logic, reason, cubase and pro tools

 Hello everyone. As the title says can someone fill me in? I haven't seen any spam (I'm guessing the mods deleted it). Also can someone tell me how it all started, thanks :)

p.s. I promise I'm not trying to agitate the situation if someone tells me to take this down I will. 




 1.What are some of your hobbies? 2. Besides hard dance what other genres on music do you like? 3. Favorite food? 4. What got you into music as a whole? 5. Can I post your response on the hardstyle sub?


1. Hobbies, anything i do is geared towards improving myself and my creativity. Be that weight training (clears body and mind) reading up on art techniques (going through a graffiti phase) or minecraft (started a few days ago, experiencing a new world), I try to keep things varied. Might take up fishing next.
2. I actually try to listen to as little hard dance as possible. This is because I want to keep my 'work' fresh and not to be over saturated with the same sounds all the time. I listen to a lot of drum and bass and movie scores, but often house, trap n moomba.
3. All food when prepared with fresh, quality ingredients is awesome. I do have a soft spot for italian cuisine, but I love a good kangaroo steak too.
4. I got into music because once I heard it, I wanted to make it. Though this question is a bit like Alice in Wonderland, the hole goes as far as you want it to go....
5. Sure. Dunno if its gonna be that interesting tho.

 














 What's your favorite distortion plug-in and why? For me I'd have to say ohmicide, it's easy to use and you can get great results with it 














 Hello all! Yesterday I made a [monstercat anime post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/2gil1y/lets_make_a_monstercat_anime/) and from the looks of it, it didn't do too well :/, but I won't let that discourage me! (If this post doesn't do well promise I won't do more) so any ways here's the premise: make up a morning routine for you favorite producer (make it as bad or as good as you want!) I'll start! " Rameses was awoken from his deep sleep by the familiar sound of rain. He quietly got out of bed and went to the window and stared out at the cloudy Yorkshire landscape. "I could wright so meany songs about this" he thought to himself, and before he knew it he had been starring out his window for 30 minuets. When he finally snapped out of it he saw he was going to be late if he didn't hurry, so he quickly ran downstairs grabbed his crumpet with jam and rushed out the door. (forgetting his umbrella I might add :3) 
























 everything is reverberating (even the start up sound) I've tried opening a new project and restarting my computer but nothings working. [heres what it sounds like](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/problem)
EDIT: It is my sound card. dose anyone know how to fix it? 
  














 I've noticed that quite a few people on here listen to rap so tell me... Who are your favorites? Mine are P.O.S/Doomtree, Brother Ali and Atmosphere (you might notice a bias here, that's because I live really close too the twin cities)  



















 "for those curious i'm 90% done with say it ain't so. another week or two and i'll start shopping to labels"
 





























 A while ago I saw this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/2dx51k/ive_always_loved_the_scifi_style_album_covers_for/) about how cool looking pretty lights album art was. So I decided why not share some cool art but this time with a heavy/industrial look. Also for those wondering Vision recordings is Noisia's record label and for those who don't know who Noisia is they are a 3 man neuro funk/DnB group and I highly recommend them!

 I've been getting into Melbourne bounce lately and I need some artist suggestions   









 For me I'd have to say TC's dog [Rex](https://m.facebook.com/tc.bristol/photos/pb.48469779094.-2207520000.1409108882./10152483245584095/?type=1 source=42) 









 I know we have some shufflers/jumpers on here and I would love too see you guys in action! Post a video of your self :D 







































 John Berkey was a artist who made [breath](http://www.fond-ecran.com/ORIGINAUX/divers/john_berkey/john_berkey_011.jpg) [taking](http://www.tucoo.com/fantasy/f_john_berkey/images/sf_john_berkey016.jpg) space ship scenes (and saying that isn't doing his art nearly enough justice). Now, some of you may be thinking "say this looks a little bit like star wars" well thats because he [did](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DuQ1FWS6Iiw/UR70HxsiF6I/AAAAAAAAdVw/3iMF1oTIWzs/s1600/star-wars-cover__john_berkey.jpg) do some art for the star wars movies. Also on an unrelated note John Berkey is the reason I know some one at VALVe and one of the reasons I got to take a tour of VALVe HQ    




 Dear Pat Powertuff, because of your expertise in the subject of RE4 I was finally able to beat it, I also learned a few things from your play through with matt: the Red9 is the perfect weapon for leading a one man crusade across "Rural Europe", the TMP is a hardened black turd (Although the ammo box is super hype), shotguns are mans greatest creation, knifes are great against crazy buff military mans, verdugos are SUPER cool!!, Salazar's whine when he gets stabbed in the hand is one of the best stupid noises I've ever heard, the broken butterfly is basically deaths scythe in the form of a magnum and finally separate ways sucks :( the only kinda good thing about it is you get to stare at Ada's butt the whole time. Best regards, test_subject8320 




 Before I goto bed I like to listen to music and in doing so I've noticed something about myself. Listening to Hardcore, Hard Trance, Hardstyle and Psy/Forest Trance actually helps me sleep while listening to Chill music by people like Mr. FijiWiji, Rameses B and Direct actually makes me less tired. Dose this apply to anyone else or is their just something wrong with my brain?  
























 I honestly love both. I love the happy up beat melodies of UK Hardcore but I also love the violently distorted kicks of Hardcore  









 My questions were:

1. Do you ever plan on doing hardcore (the non happy kind)?

2. Who are your musical influences?

3. I remember you said somewhere that you don't do collabs so if you were forced at gun point who would you collab with?

4. Can I post your response to the monstercat sub? Stay kawaii!!!!


Here's his response:

1. i really dislike the non-happy hardcore you're talking about because it doesn't 
 have any elements at all that i value in music, so no

2. mitch murder (synthwave and 80s music overall), dj shimamura, kz, early owl city.

3. i said i don't do collabs with just ANYONE. there needs to be some form of friendship established through chats or whatever imo. but if i'd have to pick someone it'd be mitch murder

4. sure. you too ()

 





































































 My questions were 1. Who are your musical influences? 2. Are any of your new tracks collaborations? 3. Can I post your response to /r/Monstercat?

Here's what he had to say:

1. I'm influenced by everything- both in music and through visual art! My older tracks just kind of happened, I just sat down and made them, no specific inspiration there!

2. No collabs- I work in a very drawn out way and I like to get things sounding exactly right before moving on, especially with my new music. I don't think many collaborators would be cool with sitting around for months working on something! That said I do have plans to work with vocalists in the future- but not the traditional "vocalist sings verse on track" kind of way, I'll have her sing whatever, and then chop it up/process it like an instrument. I like vocal snippets and how they can convey the emotion of a vocal, without actually having any discernible words. Looking to take that to the next level with my unreleased stuff!

3. Sure thing, fine by me!
 














 its by SMD and it has a guy laughing in the beginning   



















 Free songs are preferred but not required, also it doesn't just have to be monstercat  














 For me it's jay cosmic's remix of rocket  






















































 For me it's a tie between the screech from dragon born by Headhunterz and the screech from destroy by Atmozfears  









 So I did a post like this on the monstercat sub awhile ago and it got a pretty good reception. 
 Rules:
post a mix that your proud of (preferably hardstyle) in the comments and say what you use for mixing the winner will be the person with the most up votes 

* what you win: my respect as a DJ and the love of the sub (possibly) 




 I know Audiofreq has one  




 As you all know Mr. Suicide sheep always finds amazing pictures to go along with his uploads. [My favorite is this one](http://arcipello.deviantart.com/art/Scorched-earth-304068383) it's actually my back round in FL studio  














 Same Rules as [last time](http://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/27uk1n/djs_lets_have_a_little_competition/) if you competed last time just post a diffrent mix  





























 So a while ago F3tch released some patches for massive. All of them are very robotic and gritty so they might not be for every producer, but for the ones who make heavy dubstep I would recommend checking them out [heres a link to his FB page](https://www.facebook.com/F3tchmusic/app_220150904689418) 




 "Something more. Better. Greater. Meaningful. Unforgettable. Beautiful.

In the near Future."
 









 Timeless is probably my favorite. Her voice just adds so much to the song  




 Here's what he had to say "Oh awesome!   I've been considering doing some more collabs in the EDM world, maybe something trap-y.   Thanks for showing me yo " 




 By colorful I mean people like Madeon and Grant Bowtie  









 For me it would either have to be Aero Chord or Noisestorm (Aero Chord is from Greece and Noisestrom is from Dublin so it be awesome to hear their sexy accents also) 




 INFO: 
1. Post a mix you've made below (doesn't have to include monstercat songs)
2. Say what software you use (you don't have to but still it would be cool to know)

RULES FOR VOTING:
Be fair and nice, don't judge on length but on song choice, transitions, etc. 

The winner will be the person with the most points on their comment 

WHAT YOU WIN: 
1. My respect as a DJ
2. The love of our savior GQ (Maybe)   




 What do you guys think? 




 I have been watching quiet a few videos from before 2010 and I have to say, the Melbourne shuffle is really cool and it makes me a little sad that its not as popular as it used to be. So /r/ Monstercat can we bring it back or should I ask /r/ Hardstyle about this ?   




 When do you guys think it will be released?
