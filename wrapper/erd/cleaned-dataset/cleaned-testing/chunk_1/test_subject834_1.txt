 Yeah, I'm back on them now broseph.  




 Edit: I've been back on my meds, but I've kinda not taken them properly? What I mean by this is, I wake up at weird times of the day, so I take my morning dose a little bit later and my nightly dose a little bit later, but so far, I still have my symptoms somewhat under control.  




 Those are non-specific symptoms I believe. 




 I think we still use it, but very rarely... Do vets not use it anymore? 




 I live in the UK and I know that we use it but I've never actually even seen anyone on ketamine here, weird. I would love to try some if I could find it somewhere.  




 I started taking prescription opiates at about 14-15 with my girlfriend at the time. Do I regret it? Yes and No.  




 That's pretty much true I suppose, but it definitely depends on how you look at it. For example, opiates, benzos etc. won't produce the same "euphoria" as say, MDMA, Cocaine etc. 

 




 I was just wondering what your thoughts on stimulants were? I know that for me when I have some extra money I will buy any real stimulant I can get, usually Methylphenidate and Amphetamine (Rarely). I usually do this 1-3 times a year, but from my recent usage of stimulants I have realized that I don't really like them that much, but I use them because I used to really, really love stimulants. It's kind of a weird relationship with them.

Anyway, what are your thoughts on stimulants? 




 Why the heck would they put someone with psychosis on anti depressants, especially Bupropion. They should've started you off with an anti psychotic first, that's what usually SHOULD happen. 

How long do you have to wait for? (I live the UK so I don't really understand health insurances). 

Edit: If you were depressed before, then you should've been put on an anti depressant AND an anti psychotic, but it's still kinda weird putting someone with Drug Induced Psychosis on anti depressants, especially if it wasn't caused by the depression (Psychotic depression).  




 Mood lift does count as euphoria, same with sociability (to me anyway, because I'm usually not social). Well I didn't feel anything noticeably physical, so I don't think it was much L-Amphetamine, but I could be wrong on that.  




 I think your doc is correct, you are definitely paranoid for sure, so the drug induced psychosis thing is definitely a good Dx. I have schizophrenia, so I know what it's like, albeit a little different but when I'm in a psychotic break, its essentially all the same. Are you taking any medications for this psychosis? 

MDMA and Coke can both cause psychosis if abused the way you abused them, and acid also can I believe, but more commonly it's usually HPPD with acid but psychosis can definitely happen with the use of acid as well. So basically, you abused 3 drugs that can cause psychosis... Hopefully you're taking some meds, or therapy at least, but psychosis usually can't be solved by just therapy itself.

Stay safe.  




 You do realize that Amphetamine is a euphoriant?  




 So, I remember taking Freebase (Paste) Amphetamine from the streets that my sister had at my cousins wedding, she gave me a dab of it, and it didn't feel as good as something like Ritalin (that I've use quite a lot in the past). I know Amphetamine is meant to be better than Ritalin, but to me, it felt like pretty much nothing. I thought this was weird, I did get a nice feel for the music and I did get pretty talkative, but not that much, and there was no body like euphoria there. Why is this? It's kinda strange to me.  




 DHC is good, it actually feels a tad weaker than codeine to me for some reason, but it definitely lasts A LOT longer. I'm guessing codeine is pretty strong for me because I must be a good metaboliser. Have fun. 




 I've never really felt anything from caffeine, it hardly even keeps me awake, but I do drink a lot of energy drinks and stuff pretty much daily.  




 Why do people say, "I laughed longer than I should have"... How long are you meant to laugh, is there guidelines that I don't know about?  




 During the black death, it wasn't just the bubonic plague, it was also the pneumonic plague, which, is extremely contagious.  




 If you can't even speak proper English, then you can't make a cheat, whatsoever.  




 I can tell you this with experience, a lot of the time when someone gets a prescription for oxy, sooner or later, they will do something illegal with it (snorting, injecting, or just taking it for a buzz and no longer for pain). Criminalizing anyone for drug abuse/use when they are otherwise a loving parent is just, insane. Also, I think you CAN do something about it, YOU can also fight back at the heart of it.

And it would be nice to become a foster parent when I'm a little older. 

But can't you just change something at the core? Yeah, we should do something to, but YOU (and others that work in the system) can change it at it's very core. 




 Thing is, weed? Really? You wouldn't take a kid away from a family that has a few too many every night, but are otherwise loving... I just don't get it. 

Also, a parent popping a few oxy because of their "bad back" is fine, right? But weed obviously isn't because its the "law". 




 If you truly believe in that, then you aren't a modern feminist, so, good for you.

You're an egalitarian, which is great.  




 I'm sorry, but is a job more important than a persons life?  




 Hey, why don't you draw something as good or even better than this then? 




 This is actually somewhat a good story, believable and the doc will also feel sorry for you. 




 Not exactly true in all cases. 




 I had a very hard time, I know I'm schizophrenic but I there has been people that do good without meds.  




 Where do you live? I live in the UK and people with bad back pain, arthritis (depends on the type) and other shit get opiates codeine to oxy.  




 Why do people not like morphine? I dont get it... 




 Okay, so I know its incredibly stupid to come off meds without a doctors go ahead or supervision, but I accidentally came off my meds a few days ago (Seroquel) and I'm not doing so bad, the meds were working, which is good, but I wonder how long I can last before I relapse into the illness again... What if I never get ill again? I mean, do I need the meds? I'm not even sure if I even need meds... 

This is just some thoughts I wanted to write down and decided to make a reddit post.  




 Also, the OP is 20, opiate prescriptions at 20 aren't uncommon at all. 




 Question, how does going on methadone or sub screw the OP from an opiate script for the rest of his life? Here in the UK (depending on the doc I guess) I can still get opiate prescriptions for legit pain even though I am a recognized addict, even though its a little harder I might add.

Is it different in the US? Because I'm sure a doc wont just leave someone in pain just because someone's an addict. 




 Man, that's fucked up. I live in W. Scotland and my town is like 10k population (if that) and I can walk to the pharmacy which is about 5 mins walking and I'd probably see at least one or two blatant heroin addicts.  




 You may be schizophrenic, but most of what you describe is some sort of personality disorder, like sociopathy with some narcissism... Can anyone correct me if I'm truly wrong?  




 I'm sorry, but how can you be a junkie depending on the day you're having? Elaborate please. 

And western feminism is completely lost... Equalitarianism is better. 




 Either idiocy or extreme corruption.  




 Feminazis are worse than any form of junkie, so it really doesn't matter.  




 I've heard a while back (kinda just remembered) that a lot of schizophrenics gets better faster and better over time than the ones on meds. In my opinion I think that's somewhat false because everyone is different, but have you heard about that?  




 Morning is usually a break from my illness for me, until about 2 hours after I wake up, and then when it hits dark, I get really paranoid and my illness basically just gets worse during the dark.

I also get more depressed during the dark.  




 I know this is old news but it really does outrage me when shitty clinically retarded (probably 10 IQ) come into someone's house and shoot a harmless dog (and I mean harmless, eg labs, Jack Russell's etc) for no good reason other than being a brainless sub 10 IQ moron that should be euthanised. YOU DO NOT TAKE A DOGS LIFE OVER DRUGS, ESPECIALLY WEED. 

Also to cops that know cops that do this, give them this message, if
you come into my house and shoot anything for no reason, I will, and I repeat, I will get a gun and blow atleast one of your retarded brains out, thanks. 

I don't care If this sounds stupid, but it angers me beyond belief. Thanks for listening.   




 Either a mental condition or he is just fucking with everyone. 




 It's sad that certain African countries governments are so corrupt that they give about 2% of the donations to their people basically live and THRIVE through them. Have you seen certain African country leaders? They live in wealth, while their people live in extreme poverty.  




 Also, does any leader that starts unnecessary wars deserve compassion? Like a lot of US presidents, UK prime ministers etc? 

But civilians that have done nothing to deserve this, they indeed, need all the compassion they can get.  




 I love how you take that out of context...  




 Things have changed, but most of the donated cash goes to the government of certain African countries and the government of these countries basically steal the donations. 




 Everyone deserves compassion... 




 Isn't China/Chinese more clean than most of the west as well? Or am I wrong?  




 What do you mean 'Yes'... Do you mean that's what you believe or are you just answering?  




 People still believe schizophrenia means split personality? My god...  




 FEAR THIS NOW!!! 




 Not to give in to hysteria... Does he realise he's talking to the human race here?  




 No one really gives two fucks about terrorists, well compared to this anyway.  




 Enzymes bro, everyone's different. 




 It's not just bad that they're spewing misinformation (of course that's bad) but it's when people basically say that you can't have schizophrenia because you can type or make somewhat coherent sentences, because we already have a hard time believing that we're ill in the first place. 




 So in my experience I have encountered a lot of people that just don't believe schizophrenics are on the Internet. It's gotten to the point that in online society that if you even ADMIT you have schizophrenia, everyone laughs, why is this? It's as if that if you have schizophrenia or even bipolar (to a lesser extent maybe) that you can't come online, it's just simply impossible to these people.

Does the wider Internet still believe that schizophrenics pretty much just sit in a corner and cry or babble insanity as if we are insane? Do they not realise that we are just normal people that can come online and share experiences? I don't get it. 

I've even seen people that are allegedly in a psychosis come on reddit and type their thoughts, of course when I'm in a severe psychosis I don't say anything online about it and sometimes end up in hospital or... Worse, but I'm not in a CONSTANT severe psychosis that some people seem to think. 

So basically what I'm annoyed at is, on the wider Internet if you even ADMIT you're schizophrenic, you're deemed a fake and a "dumbass". Its really put me down because now, I don't know if what I experience is real. Maybe I am just a dumbass. Who knows. 

Please share you're thoughts, this was just a rant.  




 Have fun with that man, Gabapentin and Hydro, nice.  




 So basically what I was saying is that my psychosis came first and I basically found some prescription opiates and thought that maybe this will help (which it did at the time).  




 Yet to read it all yet but for me I started taking opiates (before I was prescribed meds) to basically try and "self medicate" so to speak... So for me it's/was basically a form of instant relief in a way. Anyway, love your blog :). Gonna read it all now.  




 I've been diagnosed btw, I dunno if that was a quote that yoh responded to about me or not haha... anyway may I ask something (that MAY be kinda personal) in a pm?  




 But what I'm telling you is just what I've gathered from a lot of health professionals (neurologists and stuff also) and about a year and a bit of opiate use. 

So schizophrenia wasn't really caused by anything for me, it's just stuff I've gathered from health pros :). 

And even they don't even fully understand the brain  




 Scientifically though, opiate use no matter what stage USUALLY doesn't do anything long term, except maybe depression. Also opiates have Anti depressant, anti anxiety and anti psychotic properties (I have no idea why they have anti psych properties, I don't even think scientists know this because we don't know SHIT about the brain let alone schizophrenia. 

Opiates are actually one of the safest drugs (besides weed, heck even weed can bring schizophrenia out apparently). I know quite a lot about drugs especially opiates and alcohol since I was addicted to opiates and my parents are alcoholics.

 




 It really depends on the drug, for example, opiates/opioids will not give you psychotic symptoms (except maybe through withdrawal) but drugs like amphetamine etc can. So you have to consider that.  




 Yes I have tried a few other meds, they either produced more symptoms or made me a zombie (but not sedated just emotion wise). They're working a little I guess, they've made me more insightful but the symptoms clear up then come back for longer than they've cleared up, it pretty much feels like the meds are trolling me.

I don't feel like being medicated forever, I'm just a little sad with having a mental illness I guess. Thank you for your input. 

Also, it's just my positive symptoms that somewhat get better, negatives never have.  




 I've started seroquel as my new med, I've been on it for a month and a bit, and I've been starting to get a bit better but now it feels like symptoms still breakthrough and they're doing it a lot harder now, are meds just a false hope, I was pretty much better for a week and a half (maybe 2) and it feels like everything is coming back, especially paranoia (not so much the people inside my head).

I think meds are just a false hope... no point in them now. Love you guys :* 




 Make them live with an alcoholic for 15 years. 




 I'm still in that phase were the illness is really bad... And what makes the social aspect worse is, I have really bad disorganized thoughts, I talk a little like this, "yeah so I um I dunno what I was saying so maybe we can go and chill out at the mountain? Yeah uh, yeah I dunno". Which is hard. 




 Ever since I got my first symptoms of this disease I started withdrawing, it took a little over a year to basically be in complete isolation, I'm in the midst of this isolation and it's killing me, it feels like I've pushed all of them away, and it hurts that I don't have my best friend anymore, he's been my friend for a very long time. 
Please help me, I don't know what to do, I see pictures of all of them having fun on Facebook, I drove past them all today, and they saw me like they saw a ghost... I just want my old life back. 




 Would you rather everyone essentially going mad?  




 Man, I can't handle pain at all. I had a lumbar puncture and needed pain meds for a week or two. Your pain threshold must be higher than Pluto compared to mine. 




 WHAT? No narcotics? Damn, how can it not hurt? I thought the mouth and stuff had pain receptors. 




 http://imgur.com/qUlb8G4 




 I feel like I'm a pussy for not being able to handle it better, sometimes I think everyone has what I have and they're just better at dealing with it and I'm lower than everyone.

Thank you, a lot. I don't know if I've hit rock yet, but I think I'm slowly getting there, but I don't want to, I want to go up NOW!!! 




 I did start CBT but I never finished it. It's really hard to do CBT for depression and anxiety when I'm psychotic, thank you for giving moral support so to speak. 




 Hey. So I've had moderate episodic depression for a while now along with schizophrenia and I just feel like it never gets better, the loneliness, the sadness, emptiness etc. sometimes when I come out of it I think that I will never go back into it, only to find my self depressed again. It's like it gives me hope when it goes away, and then takes all that hope away when it comes back.

Meh, I must just be a pussy. But does it ever get fully better? Ever?  




 But why would people thinking because I'm sometimes aware I'm ill that I can't be disabled with it? That's like saying people that know they have the flu or cancer can't be disabled with it, right? 




 Well, she thought the symptoms of schizophrenia weren't actually symptoms, which obviously made my depression worse because she put me down for having symptoms that she didn't see as symptoms... I just want to know why people do that? I don't get it.

And of course it made my schizophrenia worse because I lost more and more insight because of her.  




 I'm not irritated at all by self diagnoses, as long as you're very educated on mental health, as you said you were.

People in my family knew I was schizophrenic before any doc diagnosed me, so self diagnoses or semi self diagnoses or family diagnoses (in my case) can be helpful to the person and the doctor that will later diagnose you, well, in my case that's how it went.

And all you can do is get out of the house and get a psychiatrist AND psychologist and if you need one, someone that's educated on mindfulness, or research that form of meditation yourself and try it out while you're "in the dark" so to speak when it comes to meds. :)  




 The people that you would never think to even be depressed, commit suicide from it... It's extremely sad and shocking.

I'm very sorry, RIP.  




 Hey, so a story of my ex girlfriend... 

Well, every time I was in the midst of a delusion and acting weird and strange, and very out there and you know, "paranoid", she would get angry and say, "you can't POSSIBLY blame your disorder/illness for this", I found this very insensitive and out right stupid.

As the disease progressed I would stop seeing people, essentially isolating and not washing and having thought issues, like word salad, and again she would look at me weirdly, scoff and say, "you can't blame schizophrenia *scoff*"... Funny thing is I never blamed schizophrenia at all.

And this goes for hallucinations and my depressive episodes too.

Why is this? Please answer anyway you want, you don't have to be nice if you don't want to :).  




 How do you know you're bipolar without a Dx? 




 I have a form if schizophrenia, and I'd like to ask, what's the worst mental illness to date? Jw.  




 Do you like fame? If so, why? 




 Everything in my head is telling me I'm dying, I just want some help, I'm in seroquel, I just want something to make me feel normal. I feel really trapped in my head and don't have anyone really to talk to. Thank you. 




 I've been told it can happen in psychotic disorders too (but I might be wrong). Maybe your brain is overwhelmed with all the noise and stuff and becoming detached. 

And trauma doesn't HAVE to happen, no.  




 Dissociation? 




 Sorry for bad writing  




 Oh and suicide wasn't exactly in my thought, I'm thinking ebola got me  




 I love I'm the uk and I got sick and I'm in fear of my life that I got or had ebola and I'm giving it to people or that I'm slowly dying from it without knowing... And even if I didn't get it, what stops me from getting it in the future, I don't know what I'm even thinking... Just round and round, ebola, ebola, ebola in my head... What is this?  




 May I ask? Do you have any mental illness that makes you paranoid? Not judging as I do too but I try and not believe my insanity. 




 Hi, im still here. I was having a VERY bad few weeks, I'm starting to have some better days. I has a lumbar puncture so I've been incapacitated with pain. 









 For me at the start of delusions I know it's paranoia, then after a while if I don't take meds for a few weeks while it's starting, or maybe 5 months idk, I totally lose insight and shit... It's all insight. 




 So why are people wanting to kidnap me and my family and torture us? Why can't I think? Why can't I have relationships that last? Why do the voices commentate in what I'm thinking or doing? What is all of this? Why does it even exist, fuck it all.  




 This psychotic shit happens non stop, with or without meds, they just make it easier, without meds, I have no idea what time and place is. 




 I would give you gold if I had money, but most of it goes on opiates  




 Lately I've been having really on and off nausea, I've been having to force myself to vomit... I've been somewhat constipated (not going to the bathroom as much I used to) and unable to pass gas... I feel pretty bloated in the general abdominal, and my stomach is rumbling quite loudly and I've also had a runny nose. What could this be?  




 Either the pain meds (hydro) is causing it, or making the ibs worse... But without extra info or more symptoms I can't say for sure. 




 Well I knew I had some sort of mental illness before most doctors... Didn't know exactly what one, just thought some of the shit I was hearing and thinking wasn't right. 




 Haha, I love you man ha. 




 The longest I've made it is nearly 2 weeks lol, I've tried many times... But bad shit in life when you're trying to stop seems even worse, and that's what always makes me go back, ill try and make today my last:) 




 Alcohol made my dad into a loving caring emotional person into a hateful abusing pile of shit, in a matter of years...  




 I don't even know what I'm doing anymore, opiates aren't even recreational fun anymore, they're just something to block out the pain in life and stop my fucking obsessive fucking tendencies and all that shit, idk what I am saying, just sick of having to go through  so much shit day to day and having to hide it from everyone that can help me... What's the point? Does anyone have any advice here? I need my life back  




 I hate how people say addicts are these evil people, when in reality it's usually the opposite. 




 If I HAD to choose between alcoholism and opiate dependency, I would choose opiate dependency by far... Alcoholism fucked my family up.
