 I disagree on it's easy. When I walk out a bar in Japan, I have a choice of taking a train, bus or cab home and they will all be there waiting for me within minutes. That doesn't happen in the US and when you've been drinking, preparing for alternative transportation usually is not on the top of your thoughts.

That being said, it's no excuse to drink and drive. I simple made the statement because even with tougher laws, I don't think the US would see the same dramatic drop in people not breaking the law due to it not being easy to find other transportation. But even a small drop would be fine by me. 




 The key difference is that Japan has quality and safe public transportation so that it's easy to go out drinking without driving or designating someone as a driver.  









 Not to have any resolutions - I learned long ago that if something was worth making a resolution about, it was worth beginning immediately instead of waiting for the New Year to begin.  



















 It is this reason that I still don't understand why Kucinich is polling so low. The man tells the truth and has made the right call on all the big issues from a Democratic standpoint. I hope that we as voters are also brave enough o vote for a person that stands up for the truth and not someone who is supposedly "electable" 









 ??? Why is the goal $200,000 when the blimp costs $350,000 - am I missing something?

update: I see they changed it to $350,000 




 How about putting together a very simple webpage for an opposing candidate so not only does he lose money, it also earns the opposing candidate money ;) 









 Someone that seems to be talking from the heart for once instead of taking polls to see what they are supposed to say. If there is a better democratic candidate running, someone please show me what I'm missing. I don't understand why this guy isn't leadng in the polls. 




 Seriously, what happened to us as a country? Quite depressing to see what we have let our leaders do and it is abominable that there are not more in congress fighting to uphold the true American values.  




 It just depresses me to no end that of all the Democrats, there is only one that is willing to stand up to Bush and Cheney and try to hold them accountable for what they have done. If what the Bush adminstration has done sickens you, support this guy and help him keep up the fight to get rid of those that don't deserve to be where they are

 The more I listen to him, the more I hope he gets the nomination. Granted, I don't agree with some of what he is promoting, but then nobody is going to agree with me 100% of the time. What is nice is he seems to have principles which I just don't see in the others running for office. It would be nice if he could garner the Internet support that Ron Paul has and although I have been silent on this thus far, I will do my part to help from this point forward (and hope that others here on Reddit who believe he is the best candidate of the bunch will do the same)

 They really need to make a rule that anyone that says it isn't torture has to have it done to them. I bet that would solve the issue real fast. 






















































 These are the type of articles that should make it to the front page...a complete shame if this one doesn't. 




 woohoo - guess who's getting free beers tonight at the bar! 
























 Actually, I can read fine, just can't type worth a damn...sorry about that. 











































































































































 Yahoo maps seems to be hiding it too 









 Yes, the translation is pretty much dead on target. Not you average campaign speech...
