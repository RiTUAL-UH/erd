 It seems legit http://i.imgur.com/i9oKXza.jpg 









 What did you say before that

Exactly. Yet Abraham calls them Lord.

I was responding to your mindset that every time the Bible says Lord it means God.

On that I said it is untrue, adonai is used as Lord/Master of all or as Lord/Master.

But in this context it it is correct to say that in verse 3 it means God/Lord of all.

 




 The headline is from Reuters. At the time the details were not known.  




 This guy is usually correct, except when it's about Israel...

https://conflictantiquities.wordpress.com/ 




 Neither have I. 

The whole thing doesn't make sense. As far as I know Shiites don't destroy Mosques.  

IT 'source' [Al-Araby](http://www.alaraby.co.uk/society/a911a6c0-0d6a-4450-afe7-138feb8c1838) writes clearly that the militias only seized the synagogue. The Shrine of Ezra still remains under Shi'a control.

I have no idea what went wrong..

I now compared [Al-Araby's photo](http://www.alaraby.co.uk/fullimage/3f9b540d-4039-45e8-a648-9a4779a0938d/a911a6c0-0d6a-4450-afe7-138feb8c1838) to multiple photo's of the Shrine of Ezra.

There's absolutely no resemblance. 

Side note; Josephus writes that Ezra Hasofer was buried in Jerusalem.

 You got it all wrong.
One angels assignment was to tell Abraham that Sarah would him bear a child. Once his task is over, the Bible doesn't feel a need to continue speaking about him.


God appeared. 

18:1

Now the Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre

The three angels.

18:2

 And he lifted his eyes and saw, and behold, three men were standing beside him,

This doesn't mean actually standing "right" beside him for then there would be no need to run towards them

and he saw and he ran toward them from the entrance of the tent,". 

Abraham asked God not to leave him while he attended to the three angels.

18:3 
My lords (The word  (My lords) is plural, but the plural is interpreted as respectful, not meaning more then one), if only I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass on from beside your servant.

One angels assignment was to tell Abraham that Sarah would him bear a child. 

18:10
And **"he"** said  

(note it's in singular form, it was one angel speaking)

I will surely return to you at this time next year, and behold, your wife Sarah will have a son.

The angels task was over, the Bible doesn't feel a need to continue speaking about him. 

The other two angels who continued on to Sodom still had a task to fulfill. 

18:22
And the men turned from there and went to Sodom

18:32 

And the Lord departed..

(Source: Midrash) 




 




 Like I said before. 

The context of Abraham asking God not to leave him while he attends the three arriving angels clearly implies that God was NOT one of them. 




 verse 1

           

Now the Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre, and he was sitting at the entrance of the tent when the day was hot.

verse 3

      ****     

And he said, "My lords (The word  (My lords) is plural, but the plural is interpreted as respectful, not meaning more then one), if only I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass on from beside your servant.

**** is in singular form because Abraham was addressing God, not the angels. 

Abraham asked God not to leave him while he attended to the three angels. 

where did yahweh come from?

He was there the whole time. 



 



















 Nope. Jacob was face to face with an angel who had God-like attributes, not God.
You admitted to this by Moses and Aaron.
/infinite loop 









 {deletion needed} 




 And so was the angel to Jacob....

 









 The meaning for the word is always God.

Was Moses and Aaron Gods??? 














 Never.  Jacob was striven with an angel, not God himself.



Besides for in reference to God, the word "Elohim" is used all over the Bible for false gods, angels and humans (Kings etc.).

Quick example, Exodus 7:1

The Lord said to Moses, "See! I have made you a **"Elohim"**( Lord) over Pharaoh, and Aaron, your brother, will be your speaker.

The Bible means that Moses was "divine' over Pharaoh because Moses was God's representative to Egypt.

This is how Genesis 32:29 should be read
 And he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, **because you have striven with an angel of God** ("Elohim") and with men, and you have prevailed."

Edit: Just remembered Psalms 8:6 with "Elohim" in reference to angels

Yet Thou hast made him but little lower than the **"Elohim"** (angels), and hast crowned him with glory and honor.

 Very sad! May his memory be blessed.

 




 You are correct. Jabob wresling with the angel of Esau. 

Some Christians try to twist the meaning of scripture and claim it was Jesus.
They have this weird obsession with the Hebrew word "Ish" (Man).  Every time it is mentioned in the Bible they try to push Jesus in to it.

I'm in no way a Bible scholar and quite certain that I'm much younger then him.
But for anyone who reads the Bible in Hebrew all these claims sound completely ridiculous.

For any real questions, the proper person to ask is a Rabbi. 




 True, but my statement is still valid. "Adonai" is pleural  and "Adoni" is singular. 

According to you God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost all appeared in human form as "MAN" to Abraham. This is absurd. I doubt even Christians agree with you.

You also never answered my original question. If you interpret "Ish" to mean Jesus, how was Jacob able to overpower a God?

 
26 **When he saw that he could not prevail against him**, he touched the socket of his hip, and the socket of Jacob's hip became dislocated as he wrestled with him.	
 




 Exactly. Yet Abraham calls them Lord.

Sir, you are mistaken. The Hebrew word "Adonai" is used tens of times in Bible in a non divine way. 

The meaning is Lord as in Master *Edit 2/17 for Clarification:[ and also as Lord of all or God]. 

I'm mobile right now, but if you'd like, later tonight I can bring examples to prove you wrong. 

Your mistake may originate from the fact that you are reading a translation of the Bible instead of the Bible in its original form. 

*Edit 2/17 for clarification In this case it does mean Lord/Master of all or God but he's mistaken to assume that Adonai is always is in reference to God.

But as far as I l know according to the Judaism  the text is not referring to the three men only God

See http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/2vy0r5/serious_i_need_clear_explanation_for_this/conet74
for a proper explanation 

This mistake comes from translating Hebrew to English and defining one word as it's meaning without looking at each case for its context  




  [Genesis 18] 

They were three MEN

[Genesis 32:22-31]

Are you claiming that Jacob overpowered a God?  




 The Christian concept of "trinity" came much later (I think John) and flies in the face of the Bible's account of God being one. 

Being three and somehow also one doesn't make sense. 

If "God" is composed of the unity of three, then each part of that "God" is lacking and not absolute. This is not "One" "God". 

Grouping the three dependent parts together and calling that trinity a one "God" doesn't diminish this.

Also no were does the Bible suggest that the Messiah will be in any way devine. 

G-d born to a virgin mother is an ancient pagan concept which was later adapted by the Christians.

 I'll keep it mind. 




 Suggest you click on 'take a tour' for a tour of our solar system. 




 Mass chaos 




 As of now its not legal for a search and rescue org. to use a drone to search for a missing person from the air.  The FAA considers them like for profit which aren't allowed to operate without a whole bunch of licences. 

While a hobbyist can do as he pleases.

The FAA is clarifying the rules this year. Hopefully this will change.    




 The headline is the text from the website and what they claim to prove. [I](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2vi2wt/http_vs_https_speed_test/cohw968) and others clarified it in the comments section.
 




 No, thats not it. Thanks anyway for the effort! 

I'm also too young to have watched that... 




 Indeed it is. This site reminds of an IMAX film I once watched. Can't remember the name. Wish I could watch it again.

I stumbled on this website a few days ago.  




 That looks like a case of an inaccurate HTTPS speedtest result being sort of accurate... ;) 




 These types of fruad are also repetitive.. 




 I got flamed for criticizing Obama on his Vox Interview.

 In the end, after a very long covo. I managed to get a half-hearted apology from one of the Jew haters. 
 




 SPDY can disabled in Firefox by going to about:config and find network.http.spdy.enabled  and double-click on it to make it TRUE

Is this the case? 




 Its HTTPS with SPDY. Technically HTTPS is slower then HTTP, it's the SPDY that makes it faster. 




 Yeah, but currently the FAA deems all non-profit's as commercial and it would be illegal for an emergency responder to fly outdoors. He'd have to endanger himself to physically put the drone in the collapsed structure to be allowed to fly it.

 Insane. 




 Be careful, I was flamed by two users for posting that video

 




 This is why many Journalists ask to not have their passport stamped.   




 Thank you for the advice. I will surely keep it in mind. I apologize for calling him a troll.

In this case, I sent my post before reading his comment in entirety. It was sent after reading the first line, his fake quote. I thought he was just messing around.   




 Pravda means "Truth" in Russian. There's an old joke on Pravda Newspaper's so-called "Truth's" 

"There is no Pravda in Izvestia, and there is no Izvestia in Pravda" 

English "There is no truth in News, and there is no news in Truth."  




 It's a dying dialect. 

One of the times I was at The Center for Jewish History, the librarian practically begged me to switch our conservation language to Yiddish. It seems she doesn't have too many people to practice her language skills with.

With Duolingo-Yiddish on the way, maybe there is still hope.
  




 litvish/akademish, you mean the yiddishist dialect? 

 




 You caught me :) 




 I never suggested that, I agree with you.

I have no idea why my religious affiliation was brought up in this sub.

My political opinion and has nothing to do with my religious views. If the victims would have been Christian, Muslim (one of them actually was), Hindu, Sikh, Atheist etc. I'd feel the same way.

My only issue is OBAMA calling it a RANDOM event and THE CONTEXT.

France declared it a targeted attack against Jews, Obama is calling it just a RANDOM act of violence.

He is ignoring the CONTEXT of the event, the Jewish victims and the supermarket, because the CONTEXT actually shows that it wasn't RANDOM. He is being politically biased to his views on policy. I wont get in to the details, it's a side topic...  


So what? Jews aren't special, they're no better than anyone else.

Jews are not special and are no different than anyone else.

Jews don't claim to be "special".

What do you think "chosen" means?

If you think "privileged" you're making a big mistake, because being "chosen" doesn't make things easy. Actually the opposite is true. Were the Jews killed in Auschwitz "special" or "privileged"?

You get chosen for something specific, not just generally "chosen".

According to Judaism, G-d chose Jews for more duties, not privileges and is harsher to them when it comes to judgment. Jews have to obey 613 Laws while non Jews only 7.

It's directed at the Media. Understand?

Yes, it may have been written in poor taste and I will delete it, but it's in no way how you think it is, islamaphobic etc

Lol, seriously? Look at the subs your a moderator of. look at your comment history. Your obviously a zionist 

bang head on wall

Thank G-d I have a high tolerance level and can keep my cool but it's nearing the breaking point.

Do you even have a clue what the subs stand for?

I am interested in genealogy (the study of ones ancestry).
Here's reddit's Genealogy sub  http://www.reddit.com/r/Genealogy/

I created a board for people who share common Jewish ancestors to connect and help each other with their family trees.
As of now it's inactive.

All the subs stand for 'Jewish Genealogy'. 

/r/jewgen
/r/Jewish_Genealogy
/r/jewishgen
/r/JewishGenealogy

They aren't  "Zionist" code word's...
Please explain what is racist or Islamaphobic about that. If anything you're the who is being racist and Judeophobic. 

Am I not allowed to be interested in my Jewish heritage and ancestry? 
 
Have a good one. I'm taking a brake from this non-sense. /bang head on wall
 




 The source is irrelevant? Wow. You forgot how to be a credible person.

The source only uploaded an unedited video of Obama. Anyone can listen to it without bias and decide for themselves. 

Understand?

Edit 2/10
Is it important that it's disclosed what type of Muslim the victims are and what type of establishment they're in every time another situation happens?

Like I said before, my main issue is Obama calling it a RANDOM event. 




 Thank you for you concern.

My comments on this thread is my own political opinion and  has nothing to do with my belief. If the victims were Christian, Muslim (one of them actually was), Hindu, Sikh, atheist etc. i'd feel the same way.

My humble opinion is that Obama is ignoring the victims and portraying this hideous attack as something trivial. Be the victims of any race or religion.  He is ignoring the CONTEXT of the event, the Jewish victims and the supermarket, because CONTEXT actually shows that it wasn't a RANDOM act of violence

When I said that it appears that Obama is biased, I mean, that Obama has a political bias. Obama has a reason why he refrains from such discussions. I wont get it to it now, it's a side topic...

The only one who brought religion in to the discussion (if you can call it a discussion) was [andsothenbut](http://www.reddit.com/user/andsothenbut) and [secondaryaccount22](http://www.reddit.com/user/secondaryaccount22).

 [andsothenbut](http://www.reddit.com/user/andsothenbut) "knows" I am a Zionist (even though I'm not) and [secondaryaccount22](http://www.reddit.com/user/secondaryaccount22)" knows" what's better for Jews  (I have no idea why my religion was dragged in to this political discussion) and expects I listen to his orders (typical liberal view of claiming to know better then the person and then advise them to do as they think).

You are both bigoted and anti-semitic. 




 Thanks for the heads up. The OP deleted his post and you are now only quoting my comment WITHOUT CONTEXT. 

The OP posted that 
violence against civilians doesn't equate to terrorism

my response was;

"Yes. "Hitler wasn't a terrorist" because he "didn't kill" for the purpose of scare tactics, rather for ethnic cleansing and world domination. According to you "Hitler was the good guy"?
 
My only issue is OBAMA calling it a RANDOM event and THE CONTEXT.
He is ignoring the CONTEXT of the event, the Jewish victims and the supermarket, because the CONTEXT actually shows that it wasn't a RANDOM act of violence. He is being politically biased to his views on policy. I wont get in to the details, it's a side topic...

Edit: I noticed you edited your post to try to make it look better in your favor  




 That's a lie.

Anyone can do that. Example:

 I just quoted [/u/probablyreasonable](http://www.reddit.com/user/probablyreasonable) being unreasonable
 




 The source is irrelevant.  Please stick to your argument. 

Why is my title ridiculous? The accuser must bring fourth the evidence. 
 
I agree with you that there's nothing wrong in calling Jews a "bunch of folks" or a Kosher supermarket a "deli". 

The ONLY issue IS WITH THE CONTEXT, as you so rightfully say. 

France declared it a targeted attack against Jews, Obama is calling it just a RANDOM act of violence. Couple that with the fact he doesn't mention any of the CONTEXT of the event, the kosher supermarket and the victims being Jews(which shows that it wasn't a random act of violence). It appears to me he's being *Edit for clarification 2/10 [politically] biased. 

So yes, actually it's all about CONTEXT.

Interesting observation.  Your mouth is spewing vile hate, "extremist diartbags", "Zionist".. (which to your misfortune isn't true, I'm not a Zionist) and you have the audacity to call me an extremist? 

Even though you don't care about all that I wrote an till now, i'll still do you a favor and tell you that you're ruining the image of whatever political party you belong to.

I suggest you take some deep breaths or maybe even a walk and then if you speak as a decent human being should i'll listen to your opinion. 

*Edit 2/10 for clarification: The source only uploaded an unedited video of Obama to youtube. 
 Anyone can listen to it without any bias and decide for themselves. 




 I agree  that there's nothing wrong in calling Jews a "bunch of folks?" or a Kosher supermarket a "deli". 

The ONLY issue is WITH THE CONTEXT, as you so rightfully say. 


France declared it was a targeted attack against Jews, Obama is calling it just a RANDOM act of violence which didn't target anyone specifically. Couple that with fact that President Obama did not mention any CONTEXT of said event and who was the target, makes me see him being politically biased. 

 OP, you're not going to garner support for your causes

You are wrong here again, Sir. I came on reddit to have a civil political discussion/debate. What makes you think I am trying to garner support. Am I a lobbyist?
 
 




 He had in the past.. 




 Friedlander actually did write commentaries under his own

Yes I know. That's what I wrote here.
 could have just stuck to publishing commentary under his own name

You aren't to blame, my writing skills aren't the greatest.

Also, Friedlander appears to have been a bit of a maskil 

He also left his wife a agunah and took a second wife([1](http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50517 hilite=f96a31c0-a616-49b8-b37c-addcfc58d7f0 st=%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%93%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%A8 pgnum=193)[2](http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50517 hilite=f96a31c0-a616-49b8-b37c-addcfc58d7f0 st=%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%93%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%A8 pgnum=197)) .

 and if he had published the commentary under his own name it would probably have been reasonably popular

Friedlander who forged the Yerushalmi was also a very knowledgeable person and could have just stuck to publishing his own commentary under his own name, if he would have put his mind to it. This is just something that I won't be able to understand.

And, at least in the edition I own, he includes a translation of Conan Doyle's story (presented as nonfiction) as an appendix to his own story, which is essentially a parallel narrative about the same events involving the Maharal acting behind the scenes. (Its been a long time since I actually read it so I don't remember all the details.)

Just looked it up. You are correct. 




 They enter Gitmo with a Master's degree in "Death to the crusader America and the Zionist Jew's" and graduate with a doctorate...

You can run your own Private IRC chat server on a $20 WRT54G router.  Use point to point antennas for 10 mile+ TX/RX on WiFi Band's. No FCC power limits.

 Hummus's main ingredient is the mashed chickpeas. 




 The line's that you see are called contour lines.
Each contour line represents a specific value (number) of depth below the surface of the water.

The maximum depth till the bottom surface under the water (more deep) would be the high number and minimum depth of surface till the bottom surface under the water (more shallow) would be the low number.

So let's look at question 1a: What is the maximum depth (more deep/high - number) you would reach if you traversed along the path shown below?
Follow the red line, at about 19.5 lat and 66.5 long the depth is -8,000 which is the deepest point on the line.
  




 I second it. 




 It has very much to do with what people answered on the question "What does it mean to be Jewish". 




 Interesting results.

I noticed Pesach/Passover is more important to [r/Judaism](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/) then Yom Kipper/Day of Atonement and Rosh HaShana/New Years. 

Edit: Another interesting detail, remembering the Holocaust is a lot more important to [r/Judaism](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/) then Judaism being a part of your identity.

Also Maimonides scored the most in "Who is your favorite Rabbi/Theologian.
 




 Thanks for the link. I'm also going to check if hebrewbooks.org has any of his Seforim. 

Just remembered another wild claim. He wrote that President Woodrow Wilson was a descendant of a character in his book. 
 




 Most of the story's on the MaHaRaL's Golem comes from the book Nifl'os MaHaRaL miPrague by Rabbi Yudel Rosenberg. 

R' Rosenberg also put out a book called Choshen Mishpat. I once read it and noticed it is almost an exact copy of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's book The Jew's Breastplate.

He basically plagiarized the whole plot, story-line, just switched the main character to the *Edit: [MaHaRaL] and added his own ending. He then presented the fictional tale as fact.   

In the preface of both books Nifl'os Maharal miPrague and Choshen Mishpat Rosenberg claims it was based upon manuscript's he acquired.

Since I have proof he lied regarding the book Choshen Mishpat there's no reason for me to believe Nifl'os MaHaRaL miPrague  is anything more then fiction.
 
I believe the author has zero credibility and most if not all of his story's on the MaHaRaL's Golem is false.

 The hate on social media is out of control. Search twitter for "Lakewood" and "Jew" for endless vile and anti-Semitic tweets.

Lately there has been significant raise in hate and anti-semitism from Jackson. 

The cause may have to do with recent events. A Hasidic sect built new house's bordering Jackson. For reason's I don't understand, some people don't like it.

Although this girl is clearly deranged, she is not the only family member that shares her views...
             
From social media post's it appears she may be using drugs, which explains a lot.   

Edit: I stand corrected. As far as I now know the new houses were not built near Jackson.

 It appears you are grossly ill informed on the Shi'ite Houthis relations with the Jews.

The Houthi's have a vast history of anti-Semitic violence against Jew.

The Jew's of Yemen are anti-Zionist due to the secular nature of the State of Israel. This hasn't helped them one iota.

In January 2007, Houthi leaders threatened the Jewish families in Saada and Raida, "We warn you to leave the area immediately... We give you a period of 10 days, or you will regret it."

The entire community fled to the capital where the President of Yemen gave the Jews protection in the Jewish quarter in Alafi Qaa, Sanna.

In 2008 Moshe Nahari, a well-known figure in Raida's Jewish community was shot dead.

Not too long ago a Yemenite Jew was stabbed to death. I also remember another incident where a hand grenade was thrown at a Jew which killed him. I don't know if it was by Houthi's or AQAP.

Last month two Jewish boy's in Sanna were beaten by Houthi's and forced to convert to Islam by praying the Shahadah (There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God) to their prophet Mohammed.

The Jews of Yemen are constantly being being assaulted and harassed.

The Houthi's destroyed their homes, sanctuaries, cars, took their money and property.

They took over Yemen's Jewish library which also holds many antique Jewish manuscripts and a very ancient and rare Torah scroll.

In the 1930's there were over 40 synagogues in Sanna alone, today there's only one left. Many Jewish cemetery's were also destroyed.

This the end of the 2,500 year's of Jews in Yemen.


So no, "Death to Israel" is not a reaction to government policy, it's plain old Jew hatred. 




  but unlike the Sunni extremists they don't go above their heads to kill Americans and Israelis and won't if they're not fucked with in Yemen.

This the end of the 2,500 year's of Jews in Yemen.

So no, the Houthi's aren't any different then other extremists with regard to their hatred to Jews. In a sense they are worse. Anti-Semites justify their hatred by saying they are only anti-Israel. The Jews of Yemen are clearly anti-Israel and still being targeted.
 




 If it's disturbing your normal routine of life you should see a psychologist/therapist. Cognitive therapy may also help. 


Do you experience the same level of anxiety in all large gatherings and events or is your anxiety predominant in a religious setting?

If your anxiety is predominant in a religious setting, it may very well be that your anxiety stems from a fear of being judged/guilt on religious observance or someone finding out a dark secret/sin which you are embarrassed about.   


  




 And so is your remark. 




 It's illegal for a private citizen to run a tag on a plate. In some states it's a felony even for an officer if it's for unofficial purposes. But a private investigator can access the info without problems.  

There's a website operated by PI's that do this legally online for $40. 




 Activist and blogger Abu Ibrahim Al-Raqqawi (from Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently) tweeted this back in Jan 8, 2015 A group of #ISIS members in #Raqqa are talking among them enthusiastically about the execution of Jordanian pilot, Maath al-Kassassbeh, who was burned to death by #ISIS,

He is usually correct. 




 Replied in PM. 




 Thanks. I found it in a 'Abarbanel on Nevi'im' which was printed in Amsterdam in 1641. 17th C. was a typo.
The *Sefer* itself has many notes written on the margins by the same author.  




 Take a brake from the Internet.

 Understood. It's similar to *dichuyah*, the Torah law remains in place. 




 heh. I was down voted -1 for telling the truth.

 There's an ongoing attempt to re-brand the entire Haram al-Sharif (The Temple Mound) as al-Aqsa, a campain for an overall dejewification of the 'Har Habayis'.


The Dome of the Rock is a shrine (with 7th Century mosaic passages, some anti-Christian) with no special holiness in Islam while 'al-Aqsa' or 'Farthest Mosque' is a 'Masjid' (Mosque) where according to Islam happened the first 'Qiblah'.

They intentionally uses pictures of the 'Qubbat As-Sakhrah' (Dome of the Rock) for 'al-Aqsa'. 




 I don't know if here's the right place to discuss.

My comment was in reference to this;

 No prophet has the authority to go against the Torah in any way

After further thought I agree that in essence you are right. It will never be considered going against the Torah, since the Torah itself commands a person to follow the prophet even when in the situation mentioned before.  




 You may be surprised, your question is in fact discussed in rabbinical literature.  Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein (18291908) the 'Aruch Hashulchan' (YD 83:10) raises this hypothetical question and concludes that mermaids are not kosher.

 The word 'senior' was used in reference to al-Nadhari and his affiliation with the terrorist group AQAP which was founded in 2009.  




  

In the Brooklyn Museum (p.276, fig. 310) resides a papyrus scroll numbered Brooklyn 35:1446 which was acquired in the late 19th century by Charles Wilbour. This dates to the reign of Sobekhotep III, the predecessor of Neferhotep I and so the pharaoh who reigned one generation before Moses. This papyrus is a decree by the pharaoh for a transfer of slaves. Of the 95 names of slaves mentioned in the letter, 50% are Semitic in origin. What is more, it lists the names of these slaves in the original Semitic language and then adds the Egyptian name each had been assigned, which is something the Bible records the Egyptians as doing, cf. Josephs name given to him by pharaoh (Genesis 41:45). Some of the Semitic names are biblical and include:- Menahem, Issachar, Asher, and Shiprah (cf. Exodus 1:15-21) - John Fulton

 Why did you hassle me with all of the RaMBaM's thirteen Ikarim when you could have just used the Sefer HaIkarim's three. :)  




 Here we go. I was right. http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/no-jordans-king-abdullah-ii-not-personally-flying-planes-against-isis-1486742 




 Doesn't make sense. Jordan's King is a helicopter pilot and never flew a fixed-wing, let alone a fighter jet.

 It's the cockpit of a blackhawk helicopter. 




 I think these reports are not true.

The photos of the Jordanian King wearing a flight suit was in a non-combatant role in a H-60 black hawk helicopter. He is a helicopter pilot and never flew a fixed-wing, let alone a fighter jet. When Jordan bombed ISIS it was with F-16 fighter jets. 




 Yes. It seems so. The video editing alone would not have been possible to create in a short period of time.    




 Interesting. From what I read on twitter, it seems there's a very big crowd awaiting him at the airport. I had the impression the mood was quite different. - We are all Moaath, Kullnah Moaath,    :)  




 I wrote this brief chronicle of events pertaining to the killing of Jordanian pilot, First Lieutenant Muath al-Kasaesbeh.

Aug 17, 2014 - ISIS posts a video of Haruna Yukawa, a captured Japanese national.

Sep 2014  The King of Jordan   Japan join the US-led coalition against ISIS.

Dec, 24 2014 - ISIS posted a video which purportedly shows a successful hit from a shoulder fired missile on a Jordanian F16 Fighter Jet.
Videos and photos of captured Jordanian Pilot, First Lieutenant Muath al-Kasaesbeh was also uploaded.

Dec 24, 2014 - US Central Command said in a statement that evidence clearly indicates that ISIS did not down the aircraft.

Dec 25, 2014 - The Pilot's father went on Jordanian State Television and pleaded for ISIS to have mercy on his son (later, not sure when, I think Kasasbeh's brother was also on State TV).

Jan 6, 2015 -ISIS released a video titled Message from Muslims to the Family of the Pilot.

Jan 8, 2015 - Activist and blogger Abu Ibrahim Al-Raqqawi tweeted A group of #ISIS members in #Raqqa are talking among them enthusiastically about the execution of Jordanian pilot, Maath al-Kassassbeh, who was burned to death by #ISIS,

Jan 17, 2015 - ISIS released a video titled "Interviews About the Jordanian Pilot".

Jan 19, 2015 - In a video titled A Message to the Government and People of Japan ISIS threatened to kill two Japanese hostages if a ransom of $200 million was not received within a 48 hour deadline (no pun intended).

Jan 24, 2015 - After the 48-hour deadline passed, ISIS released a video titled Slaughtering a Japanese Captive and Appeal of Second To His Family and Government in which Japanese hostage Kenji Goto Jogo stated that his fellow captive Haruna Yukawa was executed.

ISIS then switched their demands and stated the Jordanian will be killed unless Sajida al-Rishawi, an AQI (al-Qaida in Iraq) terrorist held by the Jordanian Gov. is released within the next 72 hours.

January 27, 2015 - In an ISIS released video titled Final Deadline for the Jordanian Government To Release Sjidah al-Rshaw Before Sunset Thursday, Japanese hostage Kenji Goto stated that the Jordanian air force pilot held by ISIS will be killed unless Sajida al-Rishawi, an AQI terrorist held by the Jordanian authorities is released by Sunset.

ISIS intention was to swap Kenji Goto for Sajida al-Rishawi.

January 27-28, 2015 - The Jordanian Government agreed to free Sajida al-Rishawi, but only in exchange for their air force pilot Lieutenant Muadh al-Kasasbeh and only after proof of life was given.

Japan wanted to stick to ISIS demands and have their journalist Kenji Goto freed.

ISIS did not publicly respond to the Jordanian Government.

January 29, 2015 - The deadline set forth by ISIS passed, with Jordanian Officials demanded proof of life of before agreeing to any exchange.

January 31, 2015 - ISIS released a video titled A Message to the Government of Japan with footage of Kenji Goto's dead body.

Feb. 2015 - Jordan threatened to expedite the execution of ISIS and AQI terrorist members who were currently in their custody if Kasasbeh would be killed by ISIS.

Feb. 3, 2015 - ISIS posted a 22-minute long video titled "Healing of the Belivers Chest" which includes footage of the Jordanian air force pilot Kasasbeh doused in flammable material, locked in a cage being burned alive.

Feb. 3, 2015 - Jordanian State TV reported that Jordanian pilot Kasasbeh was killed a month before on January 3, 2015.
It is unclear how they concluded his exact day of death and why it wasn't known or publicized before.

Feb. 3, 2015  The Jordanian Government said that prisoner Sajida al-Rishawi, the woman ISIS wanted in the prisoner exchange and Ziad al-Karbouli, both AQI terrorists, were executed in response to the video. 




 Contrary to popular news reports, the walls of the ancient city of Nineveh in Iraq wasn't destroyed by ISIS. https://twitter.com/Eleanor_Robson/status/561135033134899200

 I have the TIKKA RXP and it works well for me. I often go night hiking with friends and the auto-adjust is very helpful, now I don't need to worry about accidentally shining the light at my partner and ruining his night vision.
