 I seriously doubt your bookmark's bar actually saves you any time.  Typing in a web address would be much faster than sifting through all that shit. 









 I don't know if the dude doing the spread eagle is actually tied on and about to get ripped apart or if he's just really fucking committed and a badass.  




 Mr. Freeman, it's an absolute pleasure having you here. Now tell me, would you rather fight 100 duck sized horses or one horse sized duck? Since, as God, you're the only one that can actually make it happen!

 It's not cancer, spiders or an abscessed tooth.  According to the dentist, the nerve on one of my molars died and then became infected.  So, the guy who said "blood and puss" is today's winner.  The only reason it ever got to this point is because I'm a Canadian that was traveling in the U.S. and couldn't see a dentist until I got home.  Thanks for your concern everyone, I'm on antibiotics and was even prescribed percocet for the pain so I'm high as a kite. 




 Thanks for the suggestion!

 I once sent a customer a text saying "goodnight beautiful" that was intended for my wife. He still greets me with "hello beautiful" every time he calls.
