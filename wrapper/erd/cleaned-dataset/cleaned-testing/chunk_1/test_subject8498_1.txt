No me pregunten por qu pero la noche anterior, cuando nos estbamos acostando, le dije que no vaya a donde tena que ir. Simplemente tenia un mal presentimiento. Nos despertamos 6:30 am y se lo volv a decir, quera que se quede en casa conmigo, y bueno, lo hizo.       

Nos despertamos 9 y pico con el mismo escenario, 25 mil llamadas perdidas cada uno, y empezar a tratar de entender qu estaba pasando. Fue horrible para nosotros que estbamos en casa, no me quiero ni imaginar para el resto de la gente que lo vivi de mucho ms cerca.          

Fue algo fortsimo, al da de hoy sigo pasando por el mural de Once, y s que si me detengo a verlo, me angustio instantneamente.

 You're very welcome! It's crazy indeed. Even more crazy was that in that time of war, our newspapers and TV news channels said *we were winning the war*, when that was absolutely incorrect. Bare in mind, lots of TV shows made 24hs transmissions with entertainment content to gather food and clothes for the soldiers, all of which ended up in the hands of the generals and commandants, and none of the soldiers... 

It's a very interesting subject, what happened in Argentina (well, latinamerica to be more precise) around the late 70s and early 80s. Google it and you'll be amazed with the numbers. For example, close to 30.000 people were abducted, tortured, killed and disappeared by the military forces that were in power then, only in Arg. The huge majority of their bodies are still missing, with little to no data about what happened to them.

It's a part of our story that is very present to this very day, because a lot of the babies that were stolen by the same forces then are now adults who rediscover their identities with DNA tests and come foward as "hijos/nietos de desaparecidos" (sons/grandsons of disappeared people). Lots of us (me including) have family members or family friends who've been abducted and tortured. It was a dark time, and a scar that isn't quite cured yet. 




 I think you should go and see a doctor, you may be experiencing a stroke 




 I'll try to be brief, it's a very long subject, but basically... British people have populated the Falkland Islands for a long time, and they've claimed it as their own. In 1976-1983 there was a military dictatorship goverment in Argentina, and between all the shitty and genocidial decisions they took, they decided to "recover" the Islands. They sent 18 year old boys with faulty old weapons, very few clothes and very few food to battle agains a very, VERY superior british army.

Of course our country lost that war, leaving 600+ dead argentinian boys and a huge scar in the history of our country. The Falklands remain british territory, and some people here say that we should reclaim them again, that they are ours, not theirs.

If you ask me, the majority of people of my age (I'm 23 years old) doesn't really care about them. I say leave them the Islands, we can't get our country to run properly, why add more territory that we can't handle? It was pretty good trade point but we don't use that kind of export zone anymore, so we don't really have a use for them. 

Also, in my age group, there's very little to no hate towards british people or their culture. It's a thing that older people have mostly, and generaly they're also big retards in other aspects of life or political understanding. That war was just an excuse to mantain the dictatorship longer in power. The militar that was president then and that commanded the war (General Leopoldo Galtieri) was a dude that LITERALLY went to public speeches totally DRUNK, and sometimes with a glass of whisky in his hands. So, as you can see, this war was pretty pointless to begin with.

Since then (1983) a lot of the argentinian culture was based on that british hate. For example, that soccer game where Armando Maradona passed alone like 4 or 5 rivals and scored a goal is mostly remembered here not only because it was a great play, but also because it was against Britain in the World Cup. 

I for one can't hate someone just because they were born here or there, it just seems stupid to me. I know that the majority of british youth doesn't even care about that war and/or us, so... It's all good.

 /r/cringe 




 I agree with you, but I wanted to say something about this bit

 Unless they come up with some novel way of procedural generation of areas to make it feasible but I doubt this will be a surefire fix to this problem.

Bare in mind that Diablo 3 (and I'm sure other games do this as well) already has something similar; in the infinite dungeons you get random generated dungeons (that could be caves or spaces in TES) that never end until you either die or choose to get out. I see this could be applying in TES with a few tweaks in the future to make it more RPG-alike and less ARPG, like Diablo 3.
 




 I think what he meant is that in a future we could mod SkyWind and SkyBlivion into Skyrim, to make it all a single game.

Now that I think about it, could this be actually done? I haven't played other TES other than Skyrim, but I'm guessing they occur in different times and the stories could get crossed. 




 There's just so much of it 




 Spanish! Sorry I took so long answering this, I didn't see your comment haha

 De la Ra declar Estado de Sitio con toque de queda y murieron manifestantes bajo su poder a mano de fuerzas armadas que estaban reprimiendo, y defendiendo esa animalada. Tambin fue el presidente responsable cuando se tom la medida del "corralito". Son datos fcticos y con sangre, algo MUY distinto a las *acusaciones* por enriquecimiento ilcito. Ests comparando cualquier cosa, me parece errneo decir "por mucho menos". De la ra tenia un pas entero en su contra y decidi tomar una medida an peor. 




 The sad part for me is that this isn't even the first time I've got rickrolled this year. 









 I work at a pharmacy and I was restocking the aspirine section, when I dropped 2 boxes to the floor and accidentaly tripped with them.

15:17: tripped.     
15:17: im on the comedown now.      
15:17: I think I really hit bottom, no more drug dropping for me.     




 After two weeks of being dankrupt, I learned that my dealer got busted, and it appears that he's going away for a long time. This is super bad news to me as I don't know any other good dealers, and in my country is hard to get good weed.

Maybe I'll start growing my own, but its going to take time and practice. Sigh, it's a sad day for me, ents. I'm forseeing months without any, but well, I guess it was about time to start growing my own.

Uptoke for me tonight, friEnts. I love you all. 




 *I included a TL;DR at the end.*

So, last night I was wondering if I could consume Salvia in an edible way, to get a longer and more controlable/less chaotic trip, but the problem was I had only an extract (40x) and not the leaves.

After reading a bit, I decided that the best way of getting there with the tools I had was smoking slowly and in slow quantities. Around 00:30 my parents went to sleep, so I locked the door, made sure there wasn't anything breakable in my surroundings, got the water pipe out, the torch lighter, and the extract. This was my first time solo, and I wanted to go slowly and with care. I had 2 pretty strong experiences and 1 total breakthrough with Salvia, but always with friends, music, and lights on.

So, I smoked a bit and felt a little bit weird at about 3 minutes. This was still with the lights on. I still knew who and where I was, and that I was feeling like that because of the drug. I take another hit and now things begin to vibrate. I'm starting to loose the grip of my selfness and begin to see my vision sense as something more abstract, more "decontextualizable". I begin to see my perception of my life itself as something material, more simplified and understandable. I believe at that point that I'm going too fast, so I wait a bit, and when the high goes a bit down at 10 minutes, I pack another small bowl and hit it, but now I'm with the lights off and near to my bed.

When I did this, I lay down in the bed and put on an eye mask (those things they give you in airplanes so you can't see), and now I begin to see myself, my conciousness, as I start to "fall" from reality. After a couple of minutes of mild visuals and "seeing" myself, I decide to take another hit, a bigger one, and when I do, I lay down again, put on the mask, and exhale. When I did, I began to see my perception and my mind itself, my "way of thinking, of perceiving, of existing in this body" in a very material way. I mean that I materialised my very existance and understood in that moment that I am not only a human being, this is one my forms and therefore one of my many, many realities. I saw myself as an infinite being, which has no notion of past and future, only present, and that this, my human form of thinking, of existing, and of perceiving, is only one way of an arranged and organised way of existance. 

I saw the very fabrics of my reality, I now understand that what I perceive is a frame in a multiple quantity of frames, each one different from the other. I am currently in this one, but with Salvia I fell from it and watched it from far away, with perspective. 

Now, this is important. I began to panic because I couldn't think and perceive the existance as I used to, and I was afraid to be this way for ever, because I had understood reality itself and now there was no turning back. But, when this happened, I remembered that someone here said to "let go". Just let go your way of thinking, stop trying to control everything that happens on your trip, and surrender yourself to randomness. I did, I gave up every control I was trying (unsuccessfully) to have and it was very liberating. I fell in the flow of my trip and all traces of fear were gone. 

And then, I peaked. I saw ripples of different realities being generated with each motion of myself and with each thought, and in an infinite loop saw how these very realities formed a much giant larger one, like a field of reality made of little tiny other ones, and this giant larger one reapeated itself infinitely to form another giant reality, and so and so on, for eternity. I remember trying to stand up (in these other realities, I was really in bed and not trying to stand up for real), and when I did, I remembered that I've been always standing up for eternity and saw myself doing it for ever. I was wordless, I was witnessing the fabrics of existance and I won't ever forget that. It was one of the most gorgeous things I've ever seen.

This went on for 2 hours **(!)** and it had ups and downs. As I began to enter reality again, I saw it as more complex and more "in focus" than when I was watching it from far away, and I saw myself, surrounded with my notion of the universe, as super super tiny. When I was coming back, I began to see the back of my head and the universe complete, in very similar sizes. But, as I was stepping into this reality again, my head and the notion of myself began to grew smaller, and the universe larger, until it took the form and size that has now. When I watched my clock, it said 2:30am, and I couldn't believe it. It was like 5 minutes for me.

This is by far one of the most beautiful experiences I've ever had. I hope to never forget the amazing places I saw and how I surrender myself to the trip, the first time of my life I gave up control entirely and met the Salvia experience entirely. I felt the plant itself, a gigantic powerful being, carrying me to show the other realities behind this one and making me understand that yes, this is one of many, many ways of perceiving and that I am much more than only one of them. It's like seeing yourself, but not you in your human form, not you in your name and in your country, in your world and in your galaxy. You, as an existing being, and nothing more. Undefinable by our common standars, by our very existance. You just are, and now you are in this frame, in this reality, but just for the moment. It's amazing.

I believe this is the right way **(FOR ME)** of doing Salvia, in the dark, alone, and without anyone watching you. Please, note that this experience was made at my own risk, and I do not reccomend anyone to try this for their first time of doing Salvia. Read and research A LOT before smoking Salvia, and if it is your first time, always do it with someone else; a sober sitter. I, in particulary, feel that being watched by my friends launching questions to me every 20 seconds and with music makes me paranoid and kind of having bad trips. I enjoyed this experience way much than my previous ones (which I also enjoyed in perspective).

**TL;DR:** Smoked Salvia 40x extract very slowly, alone, and in complete darkness. Tripped a lot, surrendered myself to the plant, and saw my very self as a part of much other existance forms. Total ego loss and understood my existance as an morphless being. Chose to come back after 2 hours and did, and now I see reality as only 1 option of perception.

Thanks for reading! If you have any questions or if you want to share some experiences, I'll try to make sure to comment on them all. Sorry if this is poorly worded; English isn't my first language. If something is sketchy please tell me and I'll try to rephrase it. 




 I want to go for the larger and less chaotic trip that smoking provides. I know that some people chew the fresh leaves and that this provides a longest and nicest trip, more controlable and enjoyable, but I don't have any.

Is there a way of cooking it or making a tea with the extract? Thanks! 




 Last week I tried it for the first time, and I loved it. It was a gram of 20X extract, and I smoked around 0.2g, with a water bong and a torch lighter. I loved the experience, it was pretty harsh coming back, but looking back at it, it was amazing. So amazing that I smoked again that same night, a few hours later, and loved it again.

Now I have 1 gram of 40x extract, and I'm probably going to smoke some today with my SO. The thing is, tomorrow I'm going to my friend's house, the one who has the 20x extract, and we're probably going to smoke as well that day. He sure is, I will see how I feel in the moment.

But, if I decide to, is there any risk for my health? I know there's no OD with this plant, but being the psychedelics effects so strong, can it damage me in any way?

Thanks!


EDIT: Hey guys! Many many thanks for all the responses. I didn't smoke today though, but tomorrow I will. I will keep track of how I'm feeling when I repeat the experience, sadly there's little to no information about this plant but everything seems to point that no risk is involved. I'm going to explore it with care and measure anyways, and I'll keep you guys informed if anything off happens.

Again, thanks a lot for the comments! They were of real help.
 









 Instagram clearly refuses to add another format than 1:1, but now Facebook (again, because they did this in the past but then removed it) is forcing people to crop 1:1 their new profile photos. It just sucks.

I just don't understand why is this. Can someone tell my why social networks are choosing to force people to 1:1, and if some other sites are using it as well? Of course you can add edges to your pic, but that decreases the size and therefore the quality of the picture when zoomed.

Thanks in advance.

no BULLSHIT, JUST [10] AMA 














 Well, this is my first post in /r/nosleep. I hope I'll be able to express myself well, since English isn't my first language.         

I was thinking, almost meditating, about distances between us people, and how the technology now easily available in every home allows us to connect us and debate instantly about ideas and conceptions. That's admirable, and it's something to remember and charish. Let's not take it for granted.          

But also, on the other hand, at the same time a lot of people can not access to this technologies and therefore is marginated from that community, geting behind in human evolution pace. And, a lot of them can not tell us their realities such as we can, and must be in dark places and needing our help, but without getting it. And it made me sad, to think of all those people, departed from their beloveds, kidnapped girls, war prisoners, war victims in the middle east, everyone and everything that you love, gone.                

And that made me wonder about my beloved ones, my house, my things. My life. What if, say 2 to 3 years from now, some political debate gets into a discussion, and then into an issue, and then, into a international complaint, and then, into a war. And its a war with your country, and another very threatening one. And this is ALL from a trouble that to this day, did not exist. Maybe it'll originate tomorrow, but, there's a chance that in 3 years, you will be in that situation.                                            

With your beloved ones gone. Imagine your neighrhood, destroyed, your family killed brutally by bombs and bullets of high .cal, your sons and brothers, and fathers, burned and mutilated. Imagine them, with their faces and their voices gone. You knowing that you wouldn't see them anymore, hear them anymore, hug them anymore. Feel them anymore, not ever again. Your pets, all killed as well, you and a few people you know and members of your family survived, but the hunt isn't over yet and you may be the next victim. Or your left beloved ones.                

So, this is something that seems far from true, and we say ourselves that it doesn't actually seems like something that could happen, so, I'm tranquile and I sleep well that way, not thinking about it. But, it could, it HAS, it IS (in other country, to people like you and me), in it WILL BE in some point, another great war.                                

It may not be violent war, with bombs, nukes and airplanes, it could be a echonomical war, which then ends in you and your family in poverty, dying from hunger and great recesion, or a civic war, or I don't know. We, as humans, know that in time, shamefully it's going to happen.                

And now, us that can seen it before it happening, need to do something. But we can't. It's not up to us.                  
 

It's NOT up to us. It's up to THEM.               


And THEY will decide if its your country's turn, my country's turn, or someone else's country turn. We just have to wait and... see.            

*Keep a good ear for the bangs and booms.*       


EDIT: a word  




 Time when you don't smoke weed to avoid or dimish tolerance to THC 









 Ever since Season 1, when they're about to kill Eddard I was thinking "OK, he's going to get saved, obviously, any moment now... any moment... wait... what?", and so I learned that this show is not like any other show, or books for that matter.

What I mean is that I never expected to so much main characters to die, and this is something positive for me, because although I do not wish them to die, but to win and live happy forever (well, not quite, but you get my point), I enjoy the thrill of fights and challenges the characters face, because now I know that they CAN die. In any other shows, they won't die, they will only get CLOSE to dying and they'll be saved in the last second, and you get the thrill of suspense in fights and the not knowing, but you kinda expect that they will end up victoriously. But not here.

For example, when I watched last night's episode (S04E09), I was tense through the whole thing, and that's because Martin isn't afraid to kill a main character. I knew Jon could die any moment there, it was a real possibility, and that filled me with excitment. Again, I wanted him to "win" and that things ended well, and that's the same reason why I got so hyped up: because I knew the chance of that not happening was a real thing.

I like this feature a lot. It's like a double edged sword: on one hand, I get to see the characters for which I developed certain amount of affection get slaughtered, but on the other, I get the thrill and excitement of death and the "bad guys winning".

Sorry for bad english!

I think I would try that, just out of curiosity. 














 A friend of mine is starting to play LoL, so I created a new account to play along with him. We duoqueued (LVL 5 and 8 accounts), and we played like 10 or 12 games. This was just about now.


We lost most of these games, but not because of him being new, but because EVERYONE else was smurfing. And I mean, heavy smurfing. I was smurfing too of course, but I wasn't playing like full-hardcore-commando-faker. I'm very surprised of the quantity of people smurfing in low levels. I saw plays that seemed like my ELO (Plat II currently), correct builds, warding, jungle timing, epic ganks, etc. 


I tryharded some games and we won with the right calls, but they were 40 - 45 min lenght games. True torture. 


He went to sleep and I thought "hey, this must be because of the duoqueue matching us with better opponents", so I soloqueued for a bit and the story repeated itself. 


What the hell is going on? I can't imagine the hell new people are going through right now, system matching them against (and with) smurfs all day.
