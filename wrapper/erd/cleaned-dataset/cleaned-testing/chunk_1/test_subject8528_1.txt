 I know that the typical response to this is that I should wait for the games to possibly go on sale as a flash, daily or community deal but the fact of the matter is that it is winding down. 
  
What are some good games that have yet to, or won't, be featured that people should get?  
  
.

.

Some examples would be: FUEL and "The Last Remnant" for the former is good with the refueled mod and the latter is an older game.

I am not looking for anything in particular but general suggestions. 









 This is the start of the second season after the recap of the first two seasons last episode.

This is the world where Shinku selected, "Do not wind" and he is now in college while his other self, in another timeline, asks him for help. 




 This seems to be an alternate take on the series. We see Shinku and Sugintou show up which seems similar to the first series.
What are your thoughts?

Also, the ~desu begins. Semi-Official "desu" count: 14

I recently finished the game and I was wondering what people did at the very end of game when you go into the room with the doctors. They were, seemingly unarmed, but after all one had been through what did you do and why did you do it? 




 This is a MASSIVE (42,000+) batch of hits. It does require a qualification hit that pops up every once and a while. Almost perfect TO! 

http://adf.ly/R7ZuG (You should be able to find the qualification hit here too as it is just a search for the requester name) As of this time, the qualification hit is not up.

I have done about 300+ from them and they all approved! 




 Near perfect TO. http://adf.ly/QnGc4

I got a pretty good bonus from them!

 **What is it?**

The app is called Tooyoou and it is currently in open beta which uses some of your homescreen to send you ads. Here is a [link](http://tooyoou.com/howitworks) to the site where it explains how it works.

**How do I earn?**

You earn by installing the application and having a widget on your homescreen. In this widget, they will show various ads that do not have any sound or distracting flashing. If you click on each new ad that comes through that is setup to pay for clicking on it you earn $0.10 and you seem to get about half a cent through just having it shown. 

**What are some caveats?**

The main issue that I could find is that it could be a big data hog so I would suggest using it when you are on Wifi or on an actual unlimted plan. I, personally, do not know how it impacts battery life for I am using an old android phone which is always plugged in.

**How fast can you earn?**

Personally, I just joined the application and in the span of about ten or so minutes I have earned $0.62. It rotates a new ad every ten minutes or if you do any of the following:

	Connectivity to data or wireless network has changed.

	You have checked your account balance.

	You have saved your preferences using Your Choice.

**What is this Your Choice?**

It is their way of having targeted ads pointed your way. What you do is state your general age, gender and interests thus the ads will change accordingly. It is optional and only if you want to see targeted ads.

**How can you get paid?**

It appears that you can be paid once a month through Paypal. You must have a pending balance of $5.00 for it to send the money to your Paypal account. You can also download apps to earn points but I do not know the point to dollar ratio for you must have 2500 points to get a gift card. From the website where I found out about the application, the poster claimed that they have been using it for five or so months and have gotten about $450 from it all. I, personally, cannot vouch for this amount of earning for I am quite new to it. I am mainly submitting it here so that other people can find out about it.

**Where can I find this application?**

You can find it on the Google Play Store under the title Tooyoou or at this [link.]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tooyoou.android hl=en)

**Is there a referral system?**

Not that I could find! Good luck in earning! 









 **What is "Digital Generation"?**

It is a software program is one that works through distributed computing. Thankfully, you will always get the same amount per day no matter the computer regardless of the overall processing speed. You do have to download their software, but you can just run it in the background. I haven't had an impact on performance or anything of that sort. Currently, it is running any only using 40MB of my RAM, much less than that of a web browser or most other software.
  
**What is this I see about $50 a thread?**

To earn money, you have to have a thread open to use. Each thread gives you $1 per day if the computer is on for 24 hours.  

**Well crap, I do not want to pay! How can I earn?**

To get a trial thread (30 Days), you must provide a cell phone number for them to send a SMS to. If you do not get a SMS, just send a ticket to the admin by clicking on the "Tickets" tab.  

**What if I do not want to send them my cell phone number?**

You can do what I did and use a Google Voice number. This requires a Google account and you can access it at [voice.google.com](http://voice.google.com) and it is free if you are in the US or Canada.  

**How do you get paid?**
You can get paid through any of the following:

* Paxum
* Perfect Money
* Payza
* Paypal ~ NOT YET! Slated to be added by/on June 15^th  

**Do you have any payment proof?**

No, I am fairly new to the site, but when submitting a ticket the admin seemed professional and quick to respond to my problem.

**How can I sign up?**

You can either sign up through my [referral](https://coingeneration.com/auth/new/100685/) or through this [non-ref link](https://coingeneration.com).


Even if you do not pay for a thread, you can earn up to $30.00 in a month through a purely passive method. 









 I am asking this, for I am wonder how people manage to stay sane on a plane for 12+ hours straight. I know of the in-flight entertainment, but how do you manage to pass the time?  

My reason for this is that I will be flying from the east coast of the US to Japan next year. This is not my first international flight, for I went from the same area to England and flew back from France but that was about ten years ago. (I am headed to Japan with a college class for two weeks.) 




 This time we get to see what happens when Misaka meets one of her clones.

What are your thoughts on the episode? 









 Finally a Hinagiku episode and all that it entailed.

What are your thoughts on the episode? 



















 I'm a Christian (Non-demonational), but I was wondering what God said about those who visit other, supposedly, sacred sites. I am asking this because it seems as though I will be traveling to Japan in May of 2014 and during the course of the trip, we will end up visiting a shinto shrine or two. (The course I am taking the trip with is about the culture of Japan.)
 














 Things other than a biological cycle. 









 Great episode, it is interesting to see the dynamic about how the crowd on Akibastar reacted to their return. I wonder how they are going to pull it off in terms of regaining ground next episode.     
    
  









 With Zetsuen no Tempest and my fondness for classical, I was wondering if there were any other anime out there that were entirely or 95% orchestral.

My MAL: http://myanimelist.net/animelist/bookkid900 



















 We finally find out that Manami did not pass the audition and some good character development for Ryuunosuke. 




 https://www.mturk.com/mturk/searchbar?selectedSearchType=hitgroups searchWords=hubpages minReward=0.00 x=-935 y=-89

This is the screening test for the "HubPages" batch hits. When you complete the "Request Qualification" information you can begin to work on these 15 hits. Each are about a minute or less in length and pay $0.25. If you pass the screening test you receive a bonus of $10. If you almost pass you receive a bonus of $2.

Once you pass, you can begin to work on the main hubpages hits. Depending on your accuracy you can be paid anywhere from $0.20 to $2.60 extra for every ten hits that you complete.

**EDIT: It seems as though you guys killed the screening test hits.** 




 What do you think the PS4 will cost at launch? 









 We get to see a number of important things this episode:
 
1. Mimori is the new Mariko
1. There are hints of "Mariko" becoming a sadist. (It could be Tsubasa or Mimori since they have both had the same name.)
1. The Photographer is a spy.
1. The conditions for the "Center Nova" phenomenon:
 * A concert with combat
 * An atmospheric disturbance
 * Large quantities of high-purity dualium crystals.
1. The group will be attacked on their home turf next episode. 

What are your thoughts? 




 I recently discovered this trick because I routinely get shocked trying to open the door to my bathroom. Since the metal takes the shock, you do not get the pain from the discharge.

**NOTE:** Do NOT use a key that has a button on it! The discharge may cause problems for the internal circuits! 














 This was a pretty good episode. We were able to see the resolve of the three main girls in going forth with their plan even when almost no one showed up to their concert. Also, this is probably the starting point for the rest of the group to be formed for the girls who were in the OP/ED were all at the concert at the end of the song.

What are your thoughts on the episode? 




 I forgot that this game was coming out until I saw it on Amazon.com it looks really good. The two major reviews that are out are giving really high marks to it and it sounds like you can spend a lot of time playing it. Personally, I am a fan of anime so the graphics and general aesthetic is towards my interests. Also, I like JRPGs and the like too. 




 You do not have the provide context but it would be appreciated. 

Names are not important for it is the words that they have spoken/written that matter in this case.

Preferably, it would not be from someone famous or well known. 









 Why do some games have an open community for new players while others are hostile? What makes players tick a certain way?


The thing that prompted this was that I started to play "Go" online and the people I have met there have been more than willing to help me progress and learn. Why can't other video games take this openness and run with it? Everyone starts out where they are no good at said game whether it is on a console/PC or offline.
 









 I am looking at possibly getting a 3DS or saving for a next gen console (Wii U or PS4). I already have a PS Vita and have been playing that off and on.

In terms of games, I have a whole bunch of DS games from years ago. If I were to get a 3DS, I would also look at eventually getting Paper Mario, MK 7, SM3DL, LoZ:OOT, NSMB2 and maybe Pokemon Black Ver. 2 since I haven't played a pokemon since yellow edition.

Thing is, I do not know how the third party support will be for the console since the games that I am looking at are all first party... 




 This could be anything from a reference to some background characters without any voice having a story of their own. 









 **EDIT: Today, December 25th, the credits are being slow and may not show up until later today!**



First off, many of you may already know about this site and such, but this is for those who do not or who were not able to use it prior to this Christmas.

There is a site called "freemyapps" and what they do is pay you credits that you can redeem for gift cards and the like. You do not have to pay for any of the apps, unlike some other sites of this type. Their payout rate is 300 credits = $1. Some apps may be worth up to 450 credits though they hover at about 160ish. **NOTE:** It seems as though the Android apps are paying, on average, about 100 per download and are lower than that of iOS users.

To get the points, you go to the site, then you download the app from clicking on the link. That will then take you to the App Store / Play Store for you to download the application. Once it is downloaded and installed you have to open it for at least 30 seconds. It can be a bit finicky so just check after about 45 seconds or so. 

Personally, I wish that I had found the site sooner for I have been able to earn about $15 on amazon from them in the span of three days. (This has been paying more than mTurk, Swagbuck and Bing and in less time.) [PROOF](http://i.imgur.com/ISmKY.jpg)

NOTE: They install a "profile" which assigns your device ID or phone to an account but you do not have to provide a name or address for it.

Here are the links: [Non-Ref](http://m.freemyapps.com) | [Ref](http://m.freemyapps.com/share/url/b86f2818) 

**NOTE:** You must open the above links on your iOS/Android apps.  




 I am looking into getting PDf off of Amazon soon and I am wondering what you guys/girls think about the game. (I have played the previous ones on my PSP) Also, I have never imported anything before so I do not know what to expect. 









 https://www.mturk.com/mturk/searchbar?selectedSearchType=hitgroups searchWords=Victoria+Shaffer minReward=0.00 x=0 y=0

Took me about 6.5 minutes to complete.

Excellent TO.

No AC or MC. 














 Another great episode, this time focusing on Aika and Mahiro's relationship as remembered by Mahiro's dreams. In terms of plot progression, there wasn't a lot but it shows the lengths that the two took to hide their relationship. 

What are your thoughts? 




 If possible, I would be interested in seeing the data that my time on Reddit has created. Odds are my top subreddit would be /r/anime, so if it is something different it would cool to know what it is. 









 I, personally, really like it but I feel that the timing window is too small. You cannot have the same timing window as the main game on this mode. For, there can be too much on the screen to accurately see the patterns. (I mainly play 7 key) 




 I have been using the ATH-M50 headphones for about a year and a half now, but even since getting a DAC (The Audioengine D1) I've realized that there is more to hear that these headphones cannot fully reproduce. What would be a good headphone to go to from here?

**Budget:** Max of $400.00 (Though if there is something that is slightly above that amount it should be fine.)

**Usage:** I plan on using them on my computer to watch videos and listen to music. I am in a dorm so some isolation would be good and I have to travel to home on breaks.

**What do I listen to?** - I listen to anything from Jazz to Rock (Not Metal) to Classical. (I do not listen to R B or Rap)

I am looking for headphones that can accurately reproduce the recorded sound rather than adding in extra bass. 




 Wow, I was not expecting that reaction at the end of the episode from Komari. I liked the touch where the flashback at the end was mainly instrumental with only the phrase spoken by her brother as "This was all a dream".

What are your thoughts on this episode? 




 Has anyone else come across someone with a PAX icon next to their name when you look at them? I'm assuming that this means that they visited the booth at PAX. 
 




 For those of us that use Bing rewards, they are doubling the number of points today for searches. Whether or not it will be like thing until halloween is beyond me.

If you have yet to sign up for Bing rewards, it is a simple way to earn a little bit of money on the side. You can get, normally, up to 15 points a day by searching on Bing but today it is up to 30.

To sign up for bing: [non-ref](http://www.bing.com/rewards) | [ref](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9778718 rrid=_494e93a3-713d-1529-7052-79d2a1f0330c

 I have never played a Persona game before, but I keep on seeing this game popup across the web. I do like a good JRPG, but I am worried that the enemies would be too frightening to be able to play it. The Japanese setting and such won't bother me so that is a non-issue. I would rather buy golden than the PS2 version because I have a vita. Also, since it is portable I'd be able to play it on the go.

Thanks in advance! 














 In my case, it would have to be during my Sci-Fi and Philosophy course last semester. The teacher brought up [Innocence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY-A0Bt1fUg feature=plcp) after showing the tupac chochella thing. (It was to show how that, the tupac thing, was not entirely new but this type of thing is starting to occur.)

As predicted, everyone else in the class was freaking out thinking that this was extremely weird. Though in my case, I was just wanting to remember the song title to look it up later. 




 If anyone had an extra Civ V game from their Xcom preorder gift and would like to give it away, I would be more than glad to use it. 




 Great episode to start this off. Some pretty good comedy and weird/random parts. The Konami code (Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A) [Note: They left out the start...] for the vending machine was pretty funny.

Art wise, it seems to be a simpler but still detailed style when compared to Hyouka.

Your thoughts? 














 It took about a month from submitting it to it actually getting here, but it was worth it. The magnets are valued at $38.24 on their website. The case is well made, but I have yet to open it. 









 If you have a video link, please post it! 









 Gifts do not count.


In my case, it would have to be the Clannad:The Complete Collection. I would have gotten Toradora, but I am waiting it out in hopes that NISA will eventually release the bluray version in the states. 




 My story/example:

I am helping move in freshmen at my university and we had to get here early. Before one of the prep tasks that we had to do, I was coming out of lunch and someone was playing the OP to After Story on the Steinway piano up near the gym/starbucks. I ran up there and listened to him play for a while and said something about Clannad. He just laughed and started to play the OP to the first season. Meanwhile, there is a freshman's mom sitting near by bobbing her head to the music and I doubt that she knew that it was from an anime.  




 There have to be some interesting stories out there regarding this.

--------------


**My story**:


My university has an on campus steakhouse and it is part of your meal plan. As such, since the meal plan resets every week, you can go once a week. Being the person that I am, I wanted to take advantage of this for all that it is worth. 

A few months pass since starting my freshman year and I had gone every single week. Most of the time I was alone, so I would sit at the bar like area of the steakhouse and talk to the waiters and waitesses. One of the waiters, a gentleman who I guess to be in his mid to late fifties, knew that I was a Computer Science major and asked me if I had ever heard of Reddit. I answered no and went on with my meal. Later that night, I went on to Reddit and saw somethings that I'd rather not see and got off. 

A few more months pass and I was asked again by the very same waiter if I had gone on. I said that I did, but ran into somethings that I'd rather not see. He just chuckled and stated that I should give it another shot. Well, I did as such and here I am.

**TL;DR** Was told about Reddit from an older waiter at the on campus steakhouse. 









 I am new to turking, and I am wondering how long it normally takes for you for the HIT to go from Approved - Pending Payment to paid? 



















 I realize that this is requested a lot but I have seem to have run out of ones to watch. I am looking for a good comedy romance series without a lot of fanservice (Meaning no High School DxD or Maken-Ki eque series)

My current anime list is here: http://myanimelist.net/animelist/bookkid900 




 The text will state to following:

BEST - BUY CUSTOMER: You've been chosen for a 1K Reward to use at any location. To claim go to [WEBSITE REDACTED]   enter 9791

I just got one of these and nothing other than a whois leading to some building in LA comes up when searching for the website. 














 Some examples of this would have to be:
 * Mahou Sensei Negima
 * Hayate no Gotoku
 * The World God Only Knows

I really like it when the creator of a series puts these things in so that it seems like a "Just as planned" scenario.

EDIT: Added TWGOK. 
























 With the introduction of the E3 PDf demo and its inclusion in the Sony PS Vita Sizzle Reel (See [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fEX9-LR9tg feature=player_detailpage#t=101s) ) I would like to start a discussion on the possibility of an international release of PDf.

My thoughts are that, if anything, it would be announced at Anime Expo. For, according to what I have seen on the official Hatsune Miku Facebook page, they seem to have a lot of vocaloid related things there. (I realize that vocaloid and anime go, semi, hand-in-hand with one another but this, to me, seems as though it is more than just that. )

So, /r/Vocaloid what are your thoughts on this? 
























 This was my old username on multiple sites and it would be interesting to see what people do with the 900 part of it. :D 



















 Like the question states, I'd like to know if it is possible to have the original nook that has 3G and wifi become a mobile router and provide internet for a laptop or other device? Thanks in advance! 




 We all get these times where it feels as though you have watched everything or become tired with the medium as a whole. How do you get over this "slump" or "Anime block"?

I normally, get over it by looking up recommendations online or even going back to the various charts for the various seasons of anime in the past. 














 Well, me being an idiot, I let a friend borrow my 16gb flash drive and when she returned it, Windows wants to format it to only 64MB of storage space.

Note, I have tried the following:
*  HP USB Format Tool
*  Bootice
*  Disk Management (Windows)

At this rate, I am willing to boot into linux and fit it over there... 









 I have heard a lot of good things about "The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky" but I do not know whether or not to get that or get Disgaea 3 when it comes out on Tuesday.

 I have loved SRPGs since I played about 25 hours worth of Final Fantasy Tactics A2 on my DS many years ago. 

Also, I have about 60 or so in my PSN account, though I am trying to save 15 for Tony Hawk Pro Stater HD... Though, if you guys/girls state that I need to get both, then it is possible to do so. 



















 I am using g++ to compile C++ code for a project for school and I am getting, without quotes, "goodie.cpp:(.text+0xc): undefined reference to 'create()' "

What exactly am I doing wrong?

 




 I saw the post about someone getting scammed by using a similar username. (The old seeing "nn" as "m" when you glance at it) This way it won't get buried in comments and people can see it.

How to avoid getting scammed:

1. Download [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com)

2. See the person who you are getting pizza for and tag their username. (Or even do it by setting a color for their username!)

3. Use that tag to make sure the PM's line up. 

4. ???

5. Pizza. (For the correct person!) 









 Q: Did you hear what happened to the magician after you told him a lame joke?

Other person: No, what?

A: He pulled his hare out! 




 I know that this is a weird question but as I was taking a shower yesterday I had the thought of, "How in the world do things dry out without extra heat? Because water, in order to become a gas needs to reach 212F or 100C. I realize it is due to evaporation but how does it occur?" 














 I remember my dad playing this game a long time ago (1998ish) and I cannot remember the name of it. I do remember the following:
* It had a "boss" type thing that was a round cylinder that rotated and spewed fireballs.
* You had to fly around a pick up keys to open other rooms with keys.

It scared me as a kid and now I want to beat the game to get my "revenge".
