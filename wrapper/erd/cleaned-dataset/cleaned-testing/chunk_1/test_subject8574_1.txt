 So, where do i start? Well, it's 11:06 P.M. My blind is half way closed, and I'm sitting in my chair reading nosleep non-stop. I've always wanted to wright a story that send's shivers down people's spines. I wanted to do that for the longest time, though I just keep finding myself stuck in this limbo. I know I have the writing skill, but god damn! I wish I could pull one off from right under your nose like the rest have. Those people could fool all of you with the press of a button. I honestly found it laughable when people think the authors stories seem real, but the cold hard fact is most of them aren't. It's just plain, and simple story telling talent. 

That's until you find a real one.

You know when people wright bullshit tales that end with them being possessed? How about when they commit suicide while, ironically enough, they can type it out on the computer. And even better, becoming insane only to somehow collect your thought's for an hour or two in order to tell your story. It's just complete fucking disregard for quality. When following the list above, your sure to achieve ruining the atmosphere the reader has let themselves build around them. I came across a total of six of these. Each filling to the brim with awkward writing, awful build up, and not enough stupidity to give me even a single chuckle. I was just fed up, covering my face, and let out a sigh. one last story. if it's another shit storm I'm heading to bed.

Well, I'm still up.

Have you ever read "Just one last time, I want to see your face." It was crudely written piece by the author, " \ | / " And yes, it's just three line's literally, and no words to the username. It was an out of the box looking username. Hell, an out of the box username may contain an out of the box tale. Unfortunately, to my surprise, It looked worse than the other one's. I cringed with the first few lines. It had so much more potential to fill the shit list criteria than to be a dreadful tale to keep me up. 

Well, I'm still up. Why? Just keep following along and you'll see.

It start's out with the title repeating three times. Then, break's into someone trying to act like a madman, typing at his computer. In my head, I checked the childishly insane typing at his computer off the good ol' criteria. In all honesty, you've probably noticed I'm a bit of whiner. And because of that tendency, I shrugged. Being a bit of a  brat, I had to point out to myself, aloud, how the material I was reading was indeed a heaping pile of bullshit.

I feel so stupid for that now.  

Soon, it started to not be so funny. From what I'm guessing, this had to be an individual whom was interested in a particular woman. This person was writing as if being chased at the same time. There were no comma's or periods; He just started typing away as if grammar and proper spelling didn't exist. Now, at first i thought this was just a mess wearing a bad make shift ghost costume. But, just then, this individual started to write clear as day. I had saved the story in order to simply copy and paste these line's here. Funny thing is, the story itself is gone. I wouldn't exactly recommend trying to look for this story. Been there, done that. And I did it all just to find that damned story again. You can guess the outcome. Though, i still remember the story. I'll try to be as accurate as possible. "I would couress her for the end of time's and kiss her soft angelic skin above her eye's. I would whisk her away for her beauty and would hush children's tongue's for her red wine." I wouldn't call it beautiful, but it was surely a lot more poetic. This user started to wright poetic rhymes that tickled the spine. I won't lie, i was a bit intrigued. I asked myself all kind's of questions, they spanned from who was this poet? Who was this woman they talked about, and why write it... like this? soon, this poem started to turn sour. He started to talk about perverting her to his will. I will NOT tell you what he wrote at this point. It wasn't shocking or even disgusting. What he wrote from then on was merely disturbing. It was so subtle you didn't notice it at first. But as you closed in on the distorting, intriguing words it all became clear. I didn't notice right then, but i was actually scared. Though, despite how hard i tried to just move on, I was hooked on every word. 

Now, I will show you this last bit of the poem. I know what your thinking, I'm going against what i said earlier. I promise, this is the last bit you'll need to know."Bashful, my love. I know you will be here. I will one day feel your cold breath against my cheek. The story will be full. And your love bleak. It's as dark as your hair and pale face. I will free you from your golden cage, together haven will we rest in our special place. Your skin touches that of the moon. Your complexity ensues. I will break your glass door. My shadow at your red door. You will be scared. It is okay my love. for I am prepared. I will lay with you and fill your vase. I will come soon. And you, my love, will sing a wonderful tune." 

This last bit terrified me to the core. I decided to, as you already know, save the story. I then turned my computer off and hopped into bed. I started thinking about this story whilst trying to sleep. It was a haunting story that filled my mind with unspeakable horror's. I just couldn't get to sleep. I then did something i shouldn't have; I made comparison's. The golden cage with dove's, my bedroom wallpaper. Dark hair and pale skin that touches the moon, my black hair and pale white skin. But these were just coincidences, right? I hopped out of bed to check outside my window. I was so scared, I just wanted at least to know that no one was there. I wanted to just have that little sliver of hope. But when I looked out, I saw a man standing there. He was looking into my bedroom window. It's 1:30 A.M. now, and he still hasn't left.
