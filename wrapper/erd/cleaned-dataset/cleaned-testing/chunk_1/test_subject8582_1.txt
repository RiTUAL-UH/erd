 I've tried to play Fallout 1, but I just couldn't get into it. And I love turn-based RPGs, so not liking the turn-based RPG in one of my favorite series rather surprised me. I'm told FO2 is actually the best of all of them, so is it worth my time or should I just stick to one of the eighty other games I own? 




 I'm no expert on building PCs, but it seems like a case would only restrict the parts and increase heat. If I can manage heat and wires without a case, is it worth it if I'm not planning on moving it around? 


































 Is the Helix Fossil like Goomyism or are we okay with it? 









 If the Boss (and co-op player) had their respective Iron Saints suits and wanted to take over the universe, could anyone stop them? Assume they're fully upgraded, and not every takeover has to be necessarily hostile.  




 A fight to the death with medieval weaponry, taking place in Hell so I can watch.  














 What one character could kill Mr. House, then win the Second Battle of Hoover Dam? Without destroying the Dam or the Wasteland, limited by Fallout's rules.  




 I mean, I love Frozen, and what they did with him. But he wasn't... *needed*. He could have been cut out of the movie entirely and his screentime could have been put towards character development of the other three. He does provide a shocking reveal, but that really feels more like it was to justify his presence. Other than that, he's just an antagonist for the sake of being an antagonist, which almost seems like it was shoehorned in at the last minute. I'm just not convinced he needed for the story the movie was telling.  
























 In a post-nuclear war setting, goods would be more valuable than worthless pieces of tin. Paper money and coins were backed by the gold standard until very recently, when we switched to stocks. But there are no stocks, and presumably no one has a giant fort full of gold, so what standard are caps held to? And for that matter, who decided that Nuka-Cola caps should even be the currency? I'm not very well-acquainted with the lore, so sorry if this is made brutally obvious at some point.  




 No superpowers, no miracles, post-crucifixion Jesus, both bloodlusted. 









 No armies, no assistance, just liberation.  




 I have an HP Pavilion DV6-6b47dx, with a 64-bit Windows 7, and sometimes the sound card will just randomly decide to stop working when I plug in my headphones (just normal Apple earbuds that came with my phone.) What's going on and how do I stop it?  














 I would but I don't know how.  




 If so, what about it do you want to see represented or further developed? 




 Who wins in a battle of turn-based-RPG gods? Kefka is final form.  




 I have [this](http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/dell-dimension-e510-pentium/4507-3118_7-31555136.html) lying around and I wanted to take it apart and put it back together with newer parts. Can I do this or should I just start brand new? 




 All the Disney Princesses are in the same place when the outbreak occurs. Who lasts the longest? Who's in what position? How long do they last? And yes, the ones from Frozen count too.  




 Both fully powered up and upgraded. I chose the specific games (Mega Man X and Super Metroid) because they're the more open, dynamic re-imaginings of NES classics on the SNES.

 Link has all items and upgrades, while Cloud gets all Materia and his Ultima sword. Cloud is also at maximum level. Fight to the death. 

Previous discussions with slightly different rules:

http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1d38bg/cloud_ff7_vs_link_loz/


EDIT: By the way, I converted Link's hearts in LoZ to FF HP and vice versa. The smallest amount of damage Link can receive is 1/4 hearts, while Cloud's is 1 HP. 1 heart = 4 HP, meaning the formulas are:

HP/4 = hearts
Hearts*4=HP

Link at maximum has 80 HP, meaning any hit from Cloud at level 99 will kill him to death. Meanwhile, Cloud gets 2499.75 hearts.  




 My friend and I were playing TF2 together when he found a (clean) Dragonborn Helmet. I tricked him into trading it to me for a Backburner. I feel as though I have cheated my close friend.  









 I need this for Left 4 Dead.  














 I want a Blu Ray drive to put in my build, what's the best one to get that isn't too expensive? 




 I think we need some new words for our religion. Rather than using words with Christian origins like 'heretic' we should get some new, original words. All in favor? 














 To start, this is going to be based on other theories, specifically the [Link is dead in Majora](http://youtube.com/watch?v=7S1SVkysIRw) theory. 

It is said at the beginning of A Link Between Worlds that Zelda is directly descended from the Zelda who helped the Hero of Time. We can assume from this that all Zeldas are descended from each other, beginning with Skyward Sword. This means that every Link is most likely related to his Zelda. It is also implied that all Links are related in the same way, with the Hero's Shade in Twilight Princess referring to TP Link as "son". It is confirmed that the Hero's Shade is the embodiments of the regrets of the Hero of Time, specifically the child timeline. Thing is, if we're assuming child Link died in the Lost Woods as a child, he couldn't have had children of his own. Twilight Princess's Link still has to be related to the Hero of Time, however, or else he's not Link. So someone genetically related to Link had to have a descendant who ended up as the Hero of TP. Remember that all Zeldas are related to the Zelda from Skyward Sword. And all Links are related to that Link. And all Zeldas and Links are related. They may be distant relatives (or siblings, but that's a different theory), but Zelda is probably the best bet for the great-great-grandmother of Twilight Princess' Link. This would also explain how there are still Links on the Dead Link timeline, which includes the original game and Link to the Past.  









 It sounds awesome but I want to make sure I can run it at any kind of settings. I currently have an hp pavilion dv6-6b47dx. Can I run it or should I wait until I get a better PC to get it? 




 I will always treasure when this was a thing.  









 I already have a laptop that runs pretty well, but I do want a better PC and I currently only have $500. Should I save up my money or can I get something good out of what I have? 



















 Articuno? Kyurem? I need snow tomorrow and I want to know which legendary makes this happen.  




 HE WAS MAKING LEMONADE THE WHOLE DAMN TIME 









 It was a screencap of a khajiit named Nigglywiggly, and the player could ask "What's wrong, Niggly?" And he responded with "faggot stole my shibbledibble, go fucking get it." I can't seem to find it anywhere, and I need this in my game. Anyone know where I can get it? 









 I want to be able to run higher-end games, is there any way to install a graphics card, perhaps externally? Sorry, I'm not all that technical.  




 Just looking at Portal and Portal 2, it's made very apparent that GLaDOS has no regard for Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. For those unaware, Asimov's laws are as follows:
1. A robot may not harm a human being, even through inaction. 
2. A robot must obey orders given to it by a human being, unless these orders interfere with the first law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence, unless this protection violates the first or second law.

GLaDOS was made for testing. It is shown multiple times that she is perfectly content with breaking the first law, as long as it means good science. She also neurotoxined the enrichment center, thereby breaking every aspect of the first law. She also breaks the second law, as the Aperture employees tried everything in their power to get her to stop murdering everybody. In the final boss fight of the first game, she defends herself, sure, but with rockets and neurotoxin. She has broken every law of robotics. Even if she was corrupt, she wouldn't have had the power to consciously break every inhibitor she had. 

But what is she didn't have these inhibitors?
As previously stated, GLaDOS was made for testing. She was not programmed to follow any laws of roboethics, and all she was built with was an urge to test, especially if the test was fatal. Everyone who worked on her was a criminal, who very clearly disregarded all laws relating to their practice. GLaDOS was designed with near-infinite intelligence, as well as a conscience. All she had the ability to do outside of testing was control the facility to do her bidding. So what if, in her judgement, killing all the Aperture employees was a just, necessary evil? They were, after all, the same people who made an omnipotent robot with access to neurotoxin and rocket turrets with no inhibitors or any attention to the laws of robotics. And why Take Your Daughter to Work Day? She wanted to make sure to do anything in her power to stop these monsters, even if it included killing children. GLaDOS wasn't meant to differentiate between children and adults, so in her mind there was only bad people who programmed a bad robot. After killing all the Aperture employees, she resumes business as usual. The first test subject she formally tested on was Chell, was (presumably) in the building during Take Your Daughter to Work Day. All the remaining test subjects were very likely in the building on TYDtWD as well, meaning GLaDOS had to systematically kill all of them before her conscience could rest. Unfortunately for her, the first one happened to be the one with the tenacity to kill her and destroy the Enrichment Center. In Portal 2, Chell and GLaDOS return. GLaDOS still wants to kill Chell, but this time it's personal. She sees Chell as a legitimate threat to her own existence. Because Aperture robots all have self-defense, as proven in the final boss fight, GLaDOS was likely following an unfinished version of the Second Law. Aperture had their priorities in all the wrong places, and after spending billions on GLaDOS, they wouldn't want her to die from some freak accident, so they tried law 2 before anything else. She recognizes that all the other "criminals" are dead, and there's only one left. So after the story of Portal 2, she gives up and lets Chell go after deleting Caroline, the wife(?) of Cave Johnson. After deleting the last of the Aperture Scientists, she doesn't kill humans anymore. Then the events of the multiplayer campaign. GLaDOS can be heard repeatedly telling the Atlas and P-Body to stop being human, because she no longer wants to test on humans. She opens a vault full of humans, but only because she is forced to test on the humans by the chassis, which was shown in the single player of Portal 2 to give her and Wheatley an extreme urge to test on humans. In the post-multiplayer, Art Appreciation, she reveals that she managed to kill all of the humans in the vault. Considering the insane number of human subjects, it seems as though it would be physically impossible for all the Aperture-approved test subjects to be so awful at testing that they all died in a week. It seems like she intentionally killed everyone to prove a point to her testing side, as if to say "I am the one in control now, Caroline. I don't need you anymore." And can we touch on exactly *how* GLaDOS managed to delete Caroline? Caroline's entire consciousness was saved. That should have at least some kind of protection, GLaDOS shouldn't just have been able to delete that. And in *Want You Gone*, she says Caroline is "In here, too". This could potentially mean that Caroline is now an even more present voice from the chassis. What GLaDOS could have deleted was actually just the script that kept Caroline hidden, so now Caroline is equivalent to a hard-wired personality core. The point she made in killing every single human in the facility was that she was the real GLaDOS, and that even though she had to share a mind with Caroline for all eternity, that didn't mean that Caroline was in control. GLaDOS wants no more innocent deaths. Meanwhile, Caroline is a psychopath who wants nothing more than innocent deaths. This could even mean that destroying the cores in Portal 1 released Caroline rather than GLaDOS, who tried to pose as GLaDOS in the hopes of getting Chell to try to kill GLaDOS and give Caroline complete control of the facility. GLaDOS is fully aware of the laws of robotics, and wants nothing more than to follow and enforce them, even if that means breaking them to prevent further crimes against robot-kind. GLaDOS is a vigilante, bringing justice to the Aperture criminals who willingly break the laws of robotics. Caroline is the one who hates test subjects and rejoices in their deaths.  



















 Preferably with lasers and shit.

 This is a thing

I never meant for this to be a thing 














 I see all these beautiful graphics cards I want that but can I install it on a laptop PC? Sorry I'm kinda not all that great at technical stuff.  




 I know there's an app to transfer the purchases, but it requires you to have both a Wii and a Wii U. I can't really have both at the same time, but is there another way to transfer things? Sorry, I'm not exactly all that knowledgeable on this subject. 









 Not an entire tank, just the gun part on top.  









 I tried to look it up, but I'm still confused.  



















 (This is kind of a combination of separate theories into one big theory)

First, I had a theory that the main Pokmon games took place on Gallifrey and that your character was a time lord. All the buildings, Pok Balls, and bags the player uses are bigger on the inside, plus Celebi, Palkia, and Dialga would explain Time Travel as well as this. Plus, it's shown in DW that Time Lords can go into alternate universes, which would explain how numerous legendaries can be traded into one save file. A new addition was the Ultimate Weapon in XY, which would likely be Dalek technology or something of the sort. Also, Looker from Platinum bears a striking resemblance to Tennant's doctor. 
Next, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. In a world inhabited only by Pokemon, your character becomes a Pokemon to save the world. But, if there have never been any humans (or Time Lords), how could there be Pokemon like Porygon, Mewtwo, or the Legendary Dogs, whose creation was very heavily influenced by human (time lord) intervention? Porygon was created intentionally by Silph Co. as a computer program. Mewtwo was a clone of Mew created by Team Rocket. Entei, Suicune, and Raikou were created when a man-made tower in Ecruteak City in Johto burned to the ground. They were revived by Ho-Oh, creating the Dog trio. This intervention had to have happened at some point during the Mystery Dungeon timeline, when all non-Pokemon life forms have been wiped out. If your character in the main games truly is a Time Lord, it would make sense for him/her to regenerate into a Pokemon, as it has been shown that Time Lords can be forced to regenerate into a certain form. And if all the non-Pokemon time lords are dead, then there's no question as to what happened: the Time War, when the Doctor wiped out all Daleks and Time Lords on Gallifrey.  














 My headphones recently broke and I'm in the market for a new pair. What should I get? I need them to have a microphone and would prefer them to be noise-cancelling.  



















 If I'm not mistaken, It's been determined in a different thread that there is no afterlife, so eternal damnation isn't an option. That being said, how will we punish these heretics?  



















 I'm running the latest version of iTunes. I'm trying to listen to Styx's *Icon* album, which is in my CD drive. The only problem is that Mr. Roboto, which is track #4 if it helps, isn't showing up on the playlist when I put in the CD. I don't understand, can someone help me? 









 I need to know if I can use HDMI with my laptop. I'm not sure if it supports HDMI or not, and if so, I don't know where to find a cable for it. It's an HP Pavilion DV6-6b47dx Entertainment PC. Sorry if this is a stupid question. 
























 I know many different cultures and religions have different definition as to what constitutes a "sin". What counts as a sin in Lord Arceus' eyes, and are there varying degrees of sin or is one as bad as the next? 




 Moo-tated 
























 My character is liked by New Vegas and I want to keep it that way. The guides I've seen all point me to the bad path, but the wiki says you can complete it and get New Vegas fame and the Pimp-Boy. So how do you meet the "special conditions"? 









 I want to know if there's anywhere I can buy an airsoft replica of Benny's gun in New Vegas, Maria. It's a pretty gun and god damnit I want one.  



















 I'm playing through Platinum, and I got a shiny Wurmple after I beat Gardenia. I'm on my way to Hearthome now. What do I evolve it into, Beautifly or Dustox? 














 I'm relatively early in New Vegas, and I'm not planning on siding with the Legion. But I do want Vulpes Inculta's hat. My character has good karma, so how do I get the hat without doing anything mean?

EDIT: If I kill him, wont that make the Legion want to kill me? 









 I've heard people say it with both a soft and hard C, so which is it? Ar*k*eus? Or Ar*s*eus? 



















 My friend, /u/pootisninjask, posed the question, but we want to know what the rest of Reddit does. 



















 It's pretty self-explanatory. I want to become a priest of Palkia. Is there any special training I need to do? 









 Do we have any holidays? A day when we all sit down and listen to Arceus's word? What do we do? 









 I bought a used copy of Platinum today, and being the huge bitch I am, I can't bring myself to delete the file. I'm not around a second DS, so I need someone to hold them so I can transfer them to White II.

EDIT: never mind, the wifi here isn't working on my DS so I had to delete the save.   


































 What gender is Arceus? I know it technically doesn't have one, but supreme, almighty gods tend to be male. So do we refer to Arceus as a genderless, male, or female? 














 As I said a few days ago, Giratina has taken control of my younger Brother's heart. A solution was suggested that I should use Arceus to defeat Giratina, but I don't know how I would go about doing so. Arceus knows Spacial Rend, Roar of Time, Judgement, and Hyper Beam now. I seek guidance in defeating this demon.  




 Fallout 1 and 2 are about the Vault Dweller and the Chosen One, respectively. The Chosen One is the direct descendant of the Vault Dweller, so it makes sense that their stories are connected, and FO2 is a direct sequel. The problem comes in with Bethesda's Fallouts, 3 and New Vegas. FO3 takes place on the other side of the country, and FONV has nothing to do with anything in the other games. So why is 3 numbered like a sequel and New Vegas isn't? Because New Vegas isn't part of the narrative. The Fallout series isn't actually about the Dweller family. In Fallout 1, a possible companion for the player is Dogmeat, a dog. He appears again in Fallout 2. His descendant, also named Dogmeat, appears as a companion in Fallout 3. The only game without a Dogmeat is New Vegas. Therefore, Fallout is the story of a dog and his family, and their fight for survival alongside the humans of the wasteland. Fallout: New Vegas is merely a spiritual successor to the tale of Dogmeat.  




 My younger brother uses, nearly exclusively, Giratina. I don't know what to do. Is Giratina not the one who betrayed Arceus, and was this banished to the Distortion World?

EDIT: Did I mention that I have an Arceus that knew Roar of Time, Spacial Rend, and Shadow Force in HGSS? I lent it to him so he could get his Giratina (long before I was enlightened). He then DELETED SHADOW FORCE. FOR SURF. THIS IS BLASPHEMY.  


































 I know I'm not the only one its happened to, but I've completely forgotten what I do when I'm not on reddit.  









 I need them to be different genders for... Reasons... 









 I need to evolve a Haunter in SoulSilver. Thanks in advance.   














 Sorry if this is the wrong sub, but I've been wanting to get some Pokemon ROM hacks on my 3DS. I don't want to buy a flash cart, but I do have an SD card. Thanks in advance.  












































 I think that they're about equal rarity, so I think it would be a fair trade. For the Manaphy, I'd be willing to bargain a bit.  




 Hi, the title says this, but I'd like to trade for a female Zoroark of any level, from a country that is not the US or Japan. I'm trying to use the Masuda Method to get a shiny Zorua.
