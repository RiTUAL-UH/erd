 Sort of like explaining procreation to a 6 year old?  




 I had a toothache and with a little clove oil I got through it until I was seen by a dentist but I've stubbed my toe and tripped and fell directly on my knees and both times the pain was so great I THREW UP! Throw up pain is bad! 




 Here!, Here! Debating a Creationist about D's evolutionary theory and thinks that evolution says dogs can become chickens is like debating football vs soccer when said football fan thinks soccer can only be played with your ass. 




 Are you referring to the USA's general population or the rest of the educated population in the world? If you mean the USA then yes. 




 "Look at the Big Bang theory, please. Nothing exists, then everything does. Sounds like something that could be caused by an omnipotent deity if you ask me. Until that theory has been disproved, creationism hasn't either."

The problem with this logic is that the BBT and more importantly, Evolution can be disproved. That's what make it a scientific theory. This is referred to as the Popperian Princible. So far, Darwinian evolution hasn't been disproved and has, in fact, fit in quite nicely with other areas of scientific study such as geology, cosmology, and biology to name but a few.

Unlike Evolution, Creationism or ID can not be proved nor disproved because the supposed force(God) that created the universe operated supernaturally or outside the bounds of the physical world and since there is no way to test the "God did it" hypothesis it can not be regarded as a scientific theory.  

The question is not that creationism is false, maybe God really did plant fossilized dino feces to throw us off, it more that it's not science and shouldn't be taught as a competing scientific theory. 




 Just watched their parent's divorce? Were you the other woman? 




 I only got to the part where the dirt poor rural Kenyan got a text message. 




 I haven't seen this and I've been here for a year but maybe I only check it for an hour or two instead of surfing 12 hours+ till your eyeballs get tired. Sorry you're jealous but maybe timing is everything. Get a real life and good luck! 




 Christians were rarely subjected to or even sought out to be the victims of the Roman tortures of the Colosseums but the writers of Christian history want you to believe this because it makes good ticket. 

The Roman Empire, in expanding their empire, wanted to enjoin their conquered territories by allowing fully religious protocol of the future citizens to the citizen of Rome.  Bureaucracy being what is was and sadly what it is now, made citizens of conquered nations taxpayers but not enough to make a difference.

The book I was presented with as a kid that showed Christians being thrown to the so called "lion" was DISHONEST at the least and MISLEADING.  




 Sure, I'll validate that if you can give an explanation to my question. 




 I so wish that people would just say I don't know instead of giving it a spin! 




 Why in the heck would some sort of God that has existed forever, want or need anything!  Still foggy here. 




 The Bible starts with "In the beginning". I take that as only life on Earth and not time before. Most Christians would say their God has existed forever. If so, what were the motives during all this infinite time that would cause a perfect being to suddenly create anything? 




 I would venture to say that people that are impoverished and have no hope of any other kind of existence would welcome a religion that rewarded their suffering in this life for promises of eternal peace after death. 




 You make some pretty sound arguments for poverty before religion.  As a whole I would agree that Christianity in particular appeals to those that are poor. Several passages support the idea that rich folk can't go to heaven and the poor have a better chance of salvation.  Mother Theresa subscribed to this even though she, herself had the best healthcare money could buy.  

My view is that some religions make an individual"s circumstance concerning poverty or wealth an attribute or a hindrance. The Buddha came from wealth and gave everything away to understand why men suffer. But, unlike the Buddha who chose to teach how to achieve Nirvana in a lifetime, Christianity pushes believers toward death. That the only good thing to come out of a life of misery awaits after you're gone and some religions will say that if you tow the line, and accept your lot in life, your rewards in an afterlife are guaranteed. Sounds like a lot of bullcrap from ppl that are on top and want the majority of struggling ppl to stay complacent to me. 




 You bring up an interesting subject. Why were humans created with different sexual organs? If Adam just needed a friend then god could have just made another man. Since he didn't, was it his intention for Adam and Eve to have sex for pure pleasure since they would live forever? Maybe it was his back up plan just in case he had to punish them. If so, Eve still would have menstruated. Maybe he just added the whole reproduction thing like an after market add-on after the fall?  Either way, he could have designed the whole thing better so he owes me an apology in my opinion. 
BTW: guys don't have periods silly! 




 I was thinking the same thing! 




 You've made a pretty good correlation between religion and poverty. What is the point you're trying to make if any? Are you implying poverty causes ppl to be religious or that wealth makes ppl less likely to be religious?  To get to a conclusion you must present an explanation or a "why" to explain causation.  Correlation does not equal causation. 

Texas, for example has many wealthy ppl who are also very religious.
Hypothetically, you may have a town with a high number of churches and also a high number of alcoholics.  Are there lots of churches because there are lots of drunks or is it the other way around (most likely the case in my opinion)  and if it is the latter then why?
 




 You really ought to take care before you dismiss a viewpoint as ignorant. The Mongul Invasion didn't occur until the 13th century. The decline of Intellectualism began over 100 years earlier. To make this easier for you here is a link to that ignorant astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson.

 If Islamic fundamentalism hadn't overshadowed the progressive thinking of that time, a great deal of Nobel winners would have been Muslim. 




 The cynical response of Burgess to a young political aspirant is indicative that the politicians understand the games that are played.  




 Most of the known stars were discovered and named by Islamic scholars and given Arabic names during the enlightened period of 800-1100 ad. Then fundamentalism sent in.......... 




 Not sure about the becoming part but I was born an atheist. lol 




 I'm not surprised. Saw all the movies as a kid but didn't read the book until I was an adult and understood the humanity of his creation and their downfall. As to your question, the answer is yes and he has "some splaining to do! 




 Yes, ask Frankenstein.

Mary Shelly addressed this very question and the horror of the conclusion she came to sums up the relationship of a creator vs the created and the responsibility one has to the other. The evil the story of Frankenstein presents is how a creator can create life and, because of the creator's and society's rejection and lack of guidance and compassion, the creation became a monster when he didn't start out that way. Science is not the culprit but only the vehicle that allows Frankenstein to realize his real mistake/sin in turning his back on his creation out of fear and self-preservation. In this story he ultimately died for it.



 




 Scripture records Jesus as saying he is the Son of Man. This floored me when I went to my first Catholic service but I dutifully looked it up.

The expression "the Son of man" occurs 81 times in the Greek text of the four Canonical gospels, and is used only in the sayings of Jesus. 




 This is off subject but I'm curious about your flair (Pedestrian). I was a practicing Buddhist when I asked my soon to be step-sons, 7   8, what their religious denomination was. They told me they were Pedestrians. Stifling a laugh I found out that their Mom was a Presbyterian.   




 Philosophically, if there is no beginning and no end then there can never be a "now" because it would take an eternity to depart or arrive at any single point. The symbol of a snake eating itself is illustrative of this concept of an impossibility albeit a primitive one. I believe that time as a force or natural law is real. The problem seems to be how time can exist within the concept of eternity. 




 If there was no beginning and no end then.....how would there ever be a middle?  You would spend eternity catching up to or looking back at some point in time. If eternity exists then time itself is meaningless. 




 Think about it. It just is. 




 If you were given a book that had no beginning nor end and asked to stop somewhere in between you wouldn't be able to. 

The Christian god is given many attributes such as supernatural, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omni benevolent. All of these definitions fall short and so the definition of the Christian God can not be defined. If your God can't be defined then all reference can't be used. 




 Regardless of whether one demerit eventually did or did not affect your weekend pass the fact that you received any kind of negative actions based on your religious views is unacceptable. 

I hope that when you are in the "fleet" you stand fast to your moral code and, as an officer, support those that want to be true to their own and not have to slide by.  




 Is there a subreddit for the KKK? 




 I'm guessing you affirmed and dropped the last part and only had to do this once. What kind of demerits did they give you if any?  




 A client on my Meals on Wheels route turned 90. She told me last week her birthday was coming up and her family, which doesn't visit often except for her daughter, was going to celebrate it with cake even though she has told them she can't stand regular cake. So my husband and I brought her a slice of Oreo cheesecake and 2 chocolate covered strawberries on our next visit. She was so happy she gave both of us a big hug. I think she was happy, not for the cheesecake or the gesture, but that someone really listened to her. 




 cafe'=coffee, "like the drink only spelled different" 




 Have you ever done that and made eye contact with someone else with their head up? My favorite is making eye contact with someone who is devout but peeks around to see whose head is not bowed. I refer to them as the prayer police and I always give them a wink and a smile. 




 From my first enlistment to my last(4th), I affirmed and dropped the "so help me God". That said, it can be a situation where you "out" yourself to your shipmates and Command which, if your chain-of-command is hostile to atheism, can lead to some hassles. Fortunately, because of a split-tour and a decommissioning, my reenlistments were toward the end of my tours; not that I ever hid my religious views. I did however, always seek out someone that I trusted to be open-minded to reenlist me.  




 Maybe they lied too. Were there any consequences if you didn't say it? 




 Upvote above if you remember this song. 




 I depends on what branch of service you're in and when you came in. Things were a lot different for older veterans than younger ones. I'm glad you weren't forced to attend services vice clean the barracks. Sounds like some improvements have been made! 




 Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands all have Humanist Chaplains. There you go! 




 Just curious, what branch of service are you referring to. In the Navy, in all but the most extreme situations, no one had to get approval from anyone and the mental health counselor was under no obligation to report your issues to the CO/XO/CMC unless the situation warranted it. Further more, unless you told someone no one would even know.  




 Neil, do you think think this will make any difference in the minds of Americans. There have been so many good writers from Carl Sagan to Steven Gould but, to me, it doesn't seem to have made one iota as far as changing people's minds. 




 I give you this, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8M74ufF4Q. 




 You said, " I've never felt so powerless or ashamed of something going on in front of me but it helped solidly build within me the sense that you always stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves.

Read my post here. I felt the same way and I felt more shame because I was an adult in the military, knew right from wrong but because I was trying to hide a mental health issue I couldn't do anything. That's my albatross and I can't change it.  




 The last time I went to church I was in the Navy and went because I lost a bet with a Catholic friend. The bet had nothing to do with religion. The base Chaplain and I were friends and he knew I was an atheist. I pulled the Chaplain aside before service began and asked what I should do during the Eucharist. Before he answered me he asked why I was there. When I told him I had lost a bet he gave me a big grin and looked over at my friend, gave him a wink and told me to just cross my arms over my chest. He was the best Chaplain I've ever served with in my entire Navy career.  

PS: I'd never been to a Catholic mass before and I was surprised that they refer to Jesus as the "Son of Man" and not the "Son of God".   




 Did she live in Texas? 




 Definitely real. I can see the dudes left foot sticking out.  




 It's got a lot of wood though. 




 I learned later in life she had a weight problem as a teenager. My Godfather wasn't with us which was also unusual. I suspect they were having marital problems and my off-hand comment fed into her fear and insecurities so she took it out on six year old me. 




 Dumb. 




 I visited the Assembly of God, otherwise known as Holy-Rollers, when I was 12. I grew up Episcopalian so the speaking in tongues and flailing around on the floor was a shock to say the least. 

To call a family out like that on Easter seems almost medieval if not mean spirited!

 




 I was six when my parents divorced. I was sent to live with my Godparents who were also family. One night my Godmother took me and her kids to a pizza place for dinner which was a little unusual. After finishing my first slice of pizza I remarked to my cousin that my Godmother had already eaten three slices. I don't remember why I said this, maybe I just was commenting on how hungry she was or something but the next thing I knew she told me to sit there and eat the rest of all the pizza left, more than half of 2 large pies and took her kids and left to stay in the car. Not knowing why she was angry I started to stuff my face with pizza. After a while I realized I couldn't eat it all and I broke down crying. She sent my cousins back in to hurry me up but they could see I was upset and couldn't finish so they went back out to her car, told her I couldn't finish and then she came back in and boxed up all the pizza left over. We went home and she told me to sit at the dining room table and finish all the pizza. At this point I was scared and sick and didn't know what to do. I refused to eat anymore so she spanked(beat) me with a oak paddle in the shape of a hand that was 1/2" thick and then sent me to bed which I shared with my cousin who berated me for causing problems.  

Sort of tearing up just remembering this. I told my Mom many years afterwards and she could never eat pizza again. I've never told anyone else but it feels good to tell it here. ;) 




 Wow! On Easter Sunday no less. Do you remember what denomination it was?  Were you parents there? 




 I bet that guy still tells that story and laughs about it! 




 How is this public humiliation? 




 In the Navy they teach leaders to praise in public and punish in private. Even Non-judicial Punishments are conducted in private except on very rare occasions. Not all "leaders" understand this concept. On my ship (DDG), the Leading Petty Officer, Leading Chief and Department Head Officer all stood by the motto of "Motivation by Humiliation".

During a 4-day underway a young Seaman Recruit was found out to be wearing bicycle shorts for underwear and he had only brought one pair. Not satisfied with a private verbal counseling and a written warning our pipsqueak of an LPO decided he had the authority to conduct a "mini-NJP" in front of everyone in his workcenter which also included females.

He had the SR put on his Dress Blues and deliver a speech about hygiene and the proper underwear that can be worn. The LPO instructed everyone beforehand to ask many questions in order to mock and humiliate him. The SR barely managed to make it through the ordeal without breaking down mainly because he knew some of us were disgusted with the LPO's gleeful delight in bullying and stomping on the dignity of someone he cared less about. His favorite thing to smugly hum was "Another One Bites the Dust".  




 How many redditors have "In the Navy" playing in your head right now? 




 We have that in the USA too. Taste like a mustard chip. Not bad if you like mustard. 




 true religion=$$$$$$$ 




 Jesus loves me this I know
For the the Bible tells me so.
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak but he is strong.

Yes, Jesus loves me, yes Jesus loves me,
Yes Jesus loves me, the Bible tells me so.

This made me question God when I was 6 and still brings chills up my spine whenever I here it!
 




 When I went through boot-camp I was a practicing Atheistic Buddhist.  I was fortunate that a HM1 was allowed to hold "services" for me and a few other curious individuals. I was also allowed to use candles and incense in the barracks at my first duty station. The biggest problem on my first ship was my snoring! I was in the middle rack and got kicked, accidentally stepped on before I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. 

I'm curious as to what ridicule and discrimination you experienced.  




 We have an enlisted rate in the Navy. It's called RP or Religious Personnelman. Your job is to know all the different requirements of most religions and assist the Chaplain. If your unit has no Chaplain, you're it, so to speak. You can be of any religious bent or none. 

I knew an atheist Navy enlisted member whose rate was stagnant and couldn't be promoted. He decided to cross-rate to an RP because of the advancement opportunity and he was open-minded to members of all religious views or none and he eventually attained the rank of Chief. He neither judged or restricted any sailors requests nor their immediate family, and this is important, because often the family is as isolated as the service-member.     




 Funny thing for me was I looked 17/18 when I was 13. Now I just look 48, LOL.  




 First, are you married? This is important to determine how you should act. 




 I had this happen to me right after I joined the military at age 28. I looked 18 or 19 and was a low ranking enlisted sailor (seaman apprentice). A chief at my first duty station asked me some asinine questions and then made some condescending comments. When she noticed the horrified look on my face she asked how old I was and after I told her she profusely apologized.  I told her, with all due respect, that she should treat all her junior sailors as adults. 




 Well shut my mouth and keep on talkin' 




 Many atheist have posed questions to this subreddit in a very civil manner as I have. The problem is some Christians will always consider it impolite for someone to ask them to physically or intellectually defend what they believe. As a Christian, you come here already in a defensive position as you should. The fact there are a lot of atheist is not surprising since it's a debate of Christianity and anyone who challenges it.

BTW; Atheist don't just reject Christianity. It's only one among many.  Don't give yourself so much credit. 




 The problem is not so much with the Chaplain Corp. The problem comes when you have a CO or XO that are so myopically religious that they either condone abuses by the base Chaplain or use their position to punish service-members according their personally held convictions. I know this first-hand.     




 Sound about how the majority of hardworking "undocumented immigrants" from Mexico are treated in the US. They must be negatively stereotyped in order to justify profiting from the poor wages paid to them.   




 Expect Moose soon. You have been warned. 




 So you're saying you don't believe in any evil spirits, demons, satan etc.? 




 I've heard this explanation of evil as an absence of good. His supposed words were that he makes peace and creates evil. 

 




 In 1982/83, the uber-cool rich kids passed around a list of people that they thought might either want something (like an abortion/suicide) or whom they thought what might have happened to them in the past. I made it to the top ten. In a school that had a graduating class of over 2,500 it floored me that they even knew who I was, especially since I was in a work-study program and left at 1200 everyday for a part-time job. My parents moved 80 miles away and I wanted to finish school there.  

So "they", the honored and privileged students of Plano Senior High School decided that I was raped/molested by my own father and felt it necessary to divulge this "fact" to every other student at the school presumably, in an effort to help me according to their own Christian hypocrisy. This was false and my father passed away on the 8th of Dec, 1985 and none of the author's was there by my side.

2013, these same smug ares's sent me an invitation to a 30 year reunion provided I spend lots of money.

Although I would have loved to go and seen how the homecoming queen and king fared, I'm secure and happy that I've proudly served in the US military, am happily married and living in a beautiful house in Fort Worth, far, far away from Plano, Texas!  

 

 




 For some reason I picture you as Percy in the movie "The Green Mile" telling Delacroix that the mouse circus doesn't exist right before he's executed.

As an atheist myself, I find this immoral and exceedingly repugnant. Frankly it is not your place or self-deluded duty to "help" them however you seem fit. Has anyone asked you for religious CPR?

I sincerely hope you don't work in any capacity with elderly or dying patients. What you are suggesting is as unethical as a well-meaning Christian telling a dying atheist they will burn in hell forever. 




 I refer to Gen 6:6,7 and Gen 8:21,22.  




 Good question! He seems to have changed his mind or at least admitted a mistake on occasion. If not, I'd say no because he's perfect, but according to Himself, He makes mistakes, so yes and no. Hope that clarifies things! 




 With the model that Christianity presents I would have to agree with you up to a point. He could have made robots out of the angels and humans but he didn't because he needed their choice to praise him and rejoice in his presence. 

Sounds like a lot of parents that want their kids to love and respect them and follow what they believe, religious and atheists alike. Doesn't always work out that way but all but the most rigid, fundamentalist parents will make their children suffer because they exercise free will. God included but He makes it forever.

God is described as omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent, a supernatural being that has existed forever and will exist forever. Sure beats my parents description. Why then does he/it require anything, especially something as mundane as worship, appreciation or sacrifice? 
 




 You're proposing that evil is not a noun but an adjective used in reference to a sin(noun) as opposed to evil being a thing itself. This indicates that evil doesn't exist in and of itself and God didn't create it despite what Isaiah says.    




 Is there no free will in heaven? Sorry, that's a question for another time. If I understand you correctly, evil is necessary for free will. Free will is necessary for salvation. So, it follows that salvation in this world is dependent upon the existence of good and evil as both are necessary for free will. "Ultimately good" was a poor choice of expression. I meant that both equally are required. Since God created both equally then does evil supply a purpose in this world? 




 Sort of. The implication is evil is necessary for good. Which follows that evil is ultimately good. 




 Nope, try ringing the bell without stomping on the floor! 




 Wish I new what the script says. Any Early English translators on reddit? 




 Obviously Leo had the money for grave diggers or freshly executed "criminals"! 




 Suicide by peat-bog. At least it's unique! Well except for that one guy that was tied up but suicide wasn't ruled out and he was preserved for over a thousand years. Talk about leaving your body to science!  




 According to Isaiah 45:7, God created everything including evil. If not directly, he, at least, created the opportunity for original sin to be committed.  




 I've never met a fox in a foxhole that had any opinion on the matter and I been serving for 18 years. 




 You obviously never served in the military but no matter. Service-members do not have to follow unlawful orders and, in fact, are required to report any incidence of violations of the UCMJ whether or not they were involved. Furthermore, if they participate in an unlawful order, they can be prosecuted under the UCMJ and civilian authorities. That's right! double jeopardy. Also, many, many decisions are made by junior personnel on their own, so far from being the drones you speak of, the military requires that they possess reasoning skills instead of the "paint it or salute it" response you believe the military wants.   




 You had me until the Muslim professor smirked quite jewishly. Is jewishly even a word? LOL 




 From what I'm seeing, did the guy get pulled over by the police? Also, does everyone in Europe have dashcams? 




 Great question! Most people think that a species is defined by its inability to interbreed. Close but not quite. Loosely, a species can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. In the case of closely related species or subspecies they can interbreed but the offspring are generally, but not always, infertile and are referred to as a F1 hybrid. Peppermint is the plant equivalent to a mule, zorses, and ligers. 

Biology is a hell of a study!   




 My grandmother's home had three people die there. Her husband from a heart attack, her son from complications of cirrhosis and her grandson, my brother, from a heroin overdose.   














 I have a Sony VAIO K series laptop that is running XP using linksys wifi router with an external linksys receiver.  My son cleaned up my hard-drives and installed Avira as virus protection but now my computer slows down and locks up on certain times. It seems to be in conjunction with Avira downloading files up to twice a day. 

Is Avira something that is causing the problem and/or are there better protections I can use. He volunteered this as a free but I don't mind paying for something better.     




 Whenever I highlight something to print as a selection on my HP Deskjet it prints it out as "run-on" linear text instead of a screenshot type format. Any suggestions please??? 














 Mine are my brother(45) and uncle(59) that haven't worked for over a decade except sporadically and are both felons. They lived with my mother until she died Dec 11 and because of her reverse mortgage have been able to con them into staying there over a year.  The property has now been sold and they're just squatting waiting for eviction.  All this while I was in the military and sending money home to help "mom".  Received 90% disability and husband and I bought our first home.  Now, in not so disguised pleas have asked to come live with us.  Hell no!!  I still feel bad for them though. What do you guys think?    














 A local church has bought up property, 50+ homes that paid property taxes (5,000 a year avg each), in an old established neighborhood, to build a mega-church which pays zero taxes, with 5,000+ members.  Parking is at a premium so they want to nudge more "neighbors" to sell their homes to build more parking thereby lowering property values even more.  I don't mind a M-C building on undeveloped land but to reformat a neighborhood and essentially force people to sell who have lived there 30+ years doesn't seem Christlike nor neighborly.  
  My suggestion would be to eliminate the tax exception for M-C's like this because they use the existing infrastructure (roads and road improvements) and all other forms of taxpayer subsidized things like police and fire protection, public schools, libraries, weather alert systems, snow and ice removal, street lighting, storm drains, and even animal nuisance for free. These M-C's bring in a lot of money.
     They act in effect like a corporation with no rules. I think they need rules. I think the time has come to take a hard look at churches that are *wink wink* "non profit" and tax them! Reddit help!!!     


































 My uncle (57) and my younger brother (46) are soon to be homeless. They're both felons and haven't held a real job for the past decade. In addition they both have heavy drug use in their past. My uncle shows signs of his meth use even though he no longer uses. My brother has stolen from me and has never even filed a tax return. They've both lived with my grandmother and/or my mom from 2000 till they both passed. She had a reverse mortgage and they've been able to stay in the house for almost a year without paying a cent except utilities, ins. and taxes which are now due.

I was in the military until 2010 and for the past ten years sent money and gifts home to help Mom.

  I bought my first home after being rated 90% disabled. My husband and I are happy except that these "freeloaders" want us to subsidize them because "they're family".

  I won't jeopardize my own family, mental health or happiness to anyone that won't help themselves and they've had a year to figure out what to to but haven't. In one month they'll be on the street at Christmas time, no less. This depresses me to know end. The only thing I'm trying to help me out of this funk is Meals on Wheels. Wish me luck!

If anyone out there has had similar experience please share. I can't imagine it's not uncommon.
