 All late.  




 I was on a roof with my dad (we have a construction company) it was one of those metal roofs and it began to sprinkle so my dad got off the roof by ladder and i had left my tool belt so i went to retrieve it i slipped and fell a good 17 - 19 feet blacked out couldn't remember my old man couldn't even remember what happened,  GF came to visit me at the hospital didn't recognize her she started crying but for some reason my mom just stayed in my memory all i could remember about her is that she was really important so about 3 weeks later i started feeling a bit more normal, considering some of my memory feels gone even though people have told me who they are.  




 Worst day is black friday, honestly, like one time i was in this arcade playing rockband and i looked out to the mall and it was empty! I thought "its closing time already?" I left the arcade and there were some thieves in the mall and it was a totally crazy experience, they actually made a movie about me, pretty cool if you ask me. They mixed up my real name (Baul Plart) anyways my mom just made some sweet potatoe fried so BRB.  




 Black cat passing, bad luck?  




 But your opinion on the subject would be appreciated! :) 




 No. There were no question marks. :) 




 Our government is the enemy. Wake up.  




 Why would we? (Sincere question) 




 A few months ago we could put things on r/worldnews and not get censored. Now reddit is just like every other website that doesn't want problems or to offend someone.  Thats what reddit is, opinions,  facts, and speaking your mind. We need to get back to our roots. 




 Its a fucking rock. Chilllll the fuck out.  




 And free as a bird.  




 DID YOU REALLY JUST MAKE THAT PUN. OH MY GOD. HAHAHA 




 LOUD NOISES. 




 THE SPIDER MAN MUG. DAMN YOU GRAVITY.  




 3? #HALFLIFE3CONFIRMED. 




 "I kinda want one water instead of 24..." they know we'll pay for our FIJI.  




 Great read, thank you! 




 I think it may be real. Why fake something so large that you cant really prove?  




 This is awesome! Fantastic work! 




 Piss off.  




 Small things really do make a difference.  




 I am not a perfect man.

 "Extraterrestrial" doesn't necessarily mean Aliens. Satan is extraterrestrial, Demons, hell even God.

 Haha Ooo how the mind works. I expected you to go to that. I believe it as well. Might as well go out with a band huh?  




 Destruction is a form of creation.  




 Is your boy alright?  




 I was on a bridge with my Mom in Uvalde Tx, we got rear ended by a semi and we hit the guardrail and the car kinda hopped over and fell into a lake i was like 14. She and i survived (obviously). I just broke my pinky.  




 Damn, your gramps hair was slick. i bet he had to get an oil change instead of doing his hair! mad respect. 




 So i live at South Padre, Tx. Meaning the border isn't far from where i am. Immigrants come over here daily. Most dont even get caught. My father is a Border Patrol and he said if Ebola gets out of control we're leaving because of how unprotected all the borders are. My older sister is a Nurse and they had a meeting with some of the representatives of HEB, Walmart, and other businesses. They had a meeting because they needed to know what to do if they had a case here Locally. The business had to give their plans on what they would do to protect employess, food, Etc. They said they were to close down. No food. No gas. Im just giving the View of lower Texas on Ebola. If shit hits the fan, Texas is down for the count.  




 Props. I would've done the same
 




 Thank you i really appreciate it!  




 Thanks for all the info! :D 




 Thank you :) 




 Thank you. 




 Thank you, i appreciate it. 




 Think about it. 









 "we were young, we had our heads down, oh and i." Also is says "turn around" a few times. It was on the ending of Bojack Horseman episode 7 on netflix. PLEASE HELP. 




 Why do you guys like this game? Im playing Ghosts and this game is just so horrible. The mechanics are sluggish. Not to mention the graphics.  When the hell was this engine made? 2003? Why do you even play this shit?
