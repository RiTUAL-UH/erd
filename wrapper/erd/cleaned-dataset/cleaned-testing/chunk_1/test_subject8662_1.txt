 I'm looking to be the first to get quadrupal depression. It cancels out and I live a perfectly normal, happy, life with the occasional fits of hysterical sobbing. 




 No Michael, an illusion is something.... Wait... Shit 




 BEES? 




 Reddit, I'm in the school library and I have a file saved on the computer next to mine because our student drive hasn't worked for 3 weeks. The guy currently on the computer will not get up, despite being asked politely. What can I put up on the screen to get him to move without getting kicked out of school? 




 Ok, so after flashpoint, I get the how what and why of the new u, and I'm enjoying the non justice league titles. My question however is almost all of the titles seem to be reboots showing the heroes close to the beginning of their careers, which is fine and I get. However, it states that supers have only been around for a few years and based on today's releases, batmans gone through 3 robins and is on his 4th who is his 11 year old son; and the events of killing joke, rip, the year be was dead, return of bw, and batman Inc have clearly all happened, as have the lantern Corp wars.

Is there something I'm missing as to why everyone but bats and lanterns is just starting out, is everyone else lost but an explanation should be coming, or is this "because fuck you I'm grant fucking Morrison that's why?"

Edit: I understand this is not proper reddiquette but who the hell downvoted this? I was literally just asking a question I was confused about. How are there three people who though "there's something he doesn't completely comprehend and needs clarification on... NOOO!"

I understand if this is even read again that i'll get slammed for this but original three downvoters, wtf? 




 You can seek help wherever is comfortable, If you have a general practitioner, you trust, they can absolutely refer you. If you don't, cold calling can be scary and nerve wracking, but sometimes you just have to follow your instincts.

One way or the other, find someone soon. There is nothing wrong with you, but you do sound like you could use some extra support. Until then, you are beautiful and loved, and we are here to help whenever you need it. 









 Very long bad relationship had ended recently and I was interested in pursuing a mutual friend. Before I go on I should clarify that I have clinical depression and very low self worth, which i know is fairly every day for reddit, but it pertains to the story. My default assumption is that everyone hates me. I'm not overstating that, the only people I know 100% of the time that love me are my parents. 

So when I say that it was a big, hard deal asking her out, understand that it was a big, hard deal asking her out. 

But she said yes! I have never been so elated in my life. Even the previous relationship didn't start off with me asking the girl out and her saying yes. So we talked for a few weeks, planning and trying to make the schedule work but nothing ever happened. Things kept coming up. We eventual grew apart over some differences of opinion between my ex and ex's current bf.
On a later phone call with ex, she told me that the girl never liked me, and only said yes because she was scared of me and what I might do if I said no, (my depression was undiagnosed at the time and this was high school so any abnormal emotional reaction meant you were 2 steps away from bringing in a rifle.)

tl;dr My ex informed me a new romantic interest only agreed to go out with me because she was scared of me. 




 HA! YOU CALLED HIM FAT! YOU'RE FUNNY, YOU'RE A FUNNY GUY! AND COMPLETELY IGNORING THAT THAT LANGUAGE IS JUST COMMON VERNACULAR FOR SMITH WITH NO ILL INTENT, GENIUS AND FUNNY. Ass

 I dig Dylan as a songwriter, and Times They are a chanin' is on my ipod. Singing otherwise is not my cup of tea. 




 Yeah, I'm a fine arts major in school so a lot of my friends can be on the hipster side, so I can hear it about country from time to tim. 




 Starting off, I do love Nickleback and don't understand why they are hated as much as they are.  




 His name is Robert Paulson 




 Dell. Fuck everything about them. Two inspiron laptops died within a year of each other. When I sent the first laptop in, it took them 3 months to get it diagnosed and replaced and that was only after me calling and complaining multiple times. Then they were so mind fuckingly incompetent that they "fixed" the old laptop and sent it back to me. I use the quotes because I gave that to my mom and it died within a month.

Never again.  




 This one is a long shot but if I'm ever going to find it, you guys'll do it. Since I can remember, my father's been telling me about a book he once read that had his favorite one liner ever in it. A detective or a cop walks into an ME's office and says
"Well, is it murder?"
and the ME Responds
"Either that or the most thorough suicide I've ever seen"

Google, book stores, and librarians have failed me. I know it's a long shot but does anyone recognize this line and know what book it's from. It'd make a really great Fathers day gift for him. 




 The dreams don't stop for a while. I'll get back to you on when they do exactly, I'm on three years.

If you want for health reasons to loose weight then that's wonderful, but motivate for yourself fuck everyone else. In terms of physical appearance, I'm a writer so I can tell certain things from syntax and word choice, and I promise you that you are a beautiful person. 

Don't give up on mental health professionals, you'll find someone, just keep trying. You need help and you're worth the effort. It may take some time, but you will find the right fit. 




 Yeah, it's the fuckin' nights man. Stumble across a pic of an old interest or even just a couple enjoying each other and it all floods in. 




 I also didn't pick the best of schools I'm guessing. Private university in florida, the preppy to nerd ratio doesn't come down in my favor. I've had more than a few awkward moments in class cracking a futurama joke and getting blank stares....

Thanks for the sentiment though, that's encouraging.  




 You have no reason to care about me or my life and if you aren't in the mood for a long read, by all means skip this one because there won't be a tldr.
Reddit, I don't get it. I suffer from depression, and have for a long long time, though it was only diagnosed a few months ago. But even with that knowledge, there's still so much I don't understand.
A lot of my issues stem from lonlines, which I'm sure is shocking coming from a guy on the internet at 3am. However, I can't figure out what I'm missing. I'm relatively smart, have the ability to make people laugh, I'm overweight but haven't quite passed into ugly. What's the secret ingrediant to finding people that I missed? Did they teach it in school one day that I was sick. I'm not talking about a wife or my soul mate, that will come when it comes, I'm talking about a woman who can spend time with me and say you are worth spending more time with/on. Again I'm not asking for the rest of my life, but I see women all the time in these long term relationships with absolutely retched people, it makes me insane. It's a running joke with my friends that my life is a sitcom but it really is full of stereotypical bullshit that I just don't know how to get past or get around.
Which leads to my other point. The loneliness is saddening and crushing and I don't know why. The fact of the matter is things happen at different times for different people and I know I'll find someone eventually, but it's been twenty two years and while I know that mentally, emotionally it's just like this gorge of sadness and desperation that I can't seem to cross. 22 years and not one girl has ever thought to say yes or ask me out on a date.
I can't figure out how to get past this or why I need to. My time is coming, I know this. I'm smart, funny, cuteish, and can write fairly well, I know it will get there. But till then there's nights like tonight. Stumbling across pictures of the "almost had it" and just sliding down the walls, and I just don't know why.
If you read this, thank you for your time, it means the world. 




 Thank you, I really appreciate the sentiment.The small difference is that I have an a-typically presenting depressive disorder, I find and recognize joy in every day life, but then if a downswing hits I can think on those fondly, but not truly happily. 

If we go back to the gorge metaphor, if I slide down a wall a little bit, I can stop and enjoy the foliage growing on that wall, and even scoot back up a bit, until sliding down a bit further. 




 Warning!!! Downer to follow. I need to rant, maybe exercise some demons. You have no reason to care about me or my life and if you aren't in the mood for a long read, by all means skip this one because there won't be a tldr.

  I was just screwed by my colleges financial aid tacking on an extra semester to school, meaning that I'm going to have to pay an extra 7000 dollars to graduate which may mean more loans as most of my scholarships expire after year four.
I desperately need a job, even more so now that I zerod out my bank account to get my car towed and looked at to determine that the timing belt I had replaced six months ago snapped again, and I don't have money to fix it. But if you don't have reliable transportation, most companies are turning you down out of hand.
My mentor through college is getting laid off because the head of our department is a jelous territorial cunt who can't stand that my mentor is more talented and well liked than her. This is causing major stress in terms of finding work and is severely damaging her marriage to a guy who has become one of my closest friends.
I also recently found out that my grandfather is dying of colon cancer and while he still should have a few good months, probably won't live to see me graduate college, which he would have if this snafu hadn't happened and I was walking in two weeks.
No entertaining stories but I could use a pick me up. 




 Abortion is state sponsored murder. I'm a democrat with a lot of feminist friends, we don't talk about this... 




 THATS what it was 




 I... I don't.... Can somebody else take this one, I don't have the words. 




 I'm working on it, I've been power reading through so it's burried my history and that's a google search I'm not going too specific on. 




 That's my thing. They once did a joke about snorting crushed d d die off of an 11 year old boys ass. They've done way worse.

 Please please please please keep this reasoned and cool headed. I just want an actual discussion and finding out what other people think about the dickwolves controversy from the last few months.

How I view things right now.

It was a joke. An off color joke that wasn't meant to offend but was inevitably going to. If you go back and read the original script, it was a commentary on "heroic" gaming culture and there is no conceivable way that it can be read as supporting rape. 

That being said, they could have handled the fallout better. They shouldn't have apologize, nor should they have been asked to, and the follow up comic about the matter was perfect. However, pressing the issue just to press it with the t shirt and all of that was not necessary and shouldn't have been done. 

When it comes down to it it was a joke, a joke I personally laughed at, and I have had rape touch my life in multiple incidents. If you were offended by it, then I'm sorry but sometimes people are going to make jokes that are going to offend you and that doesn't mean that they are advocating the position that did the offending. 

For those saying this issue is done with, what spawned me writing this was going through the back catalog and researching their development for inspiration and I came across timelines and opinion pieces, it's very much not dead.

Just wanted some other people's thoughts and opinions on the issue.

 For light depression maybe but for my case and what I gather to be this man's case, it's a chemical imbalance and outside of Neo level thought control no, you cannot just think yourself happy. 




 Speaking as someone who suffers from clinical depression, I would ask that you stop pimping bullshit pseudoscience and do a little bit of research into how crippling and hellacious an experience it is, and how for 95% of us, it's a bit harder than being stronger and realizing "fear is a facade" or whatever else you heard at that particular hotel ballroom.  




 I grew up in the south, so there were a lot of rednecks and bullies. The rednecks who would throw out hateful speech left and right and assume you would agree with them, and the bullies who strutted around the place thinking they were top shit when you knew how sad they really were but also knew how readily and totally they could fuck your shit up so you just steered clear and had a begrudging respect for them even if you didn't agree with them.

In 8th grade the rednecks and bullies started feuding at it was the most wonderful piece of MADD come to life I've ever seen. Many people from both groups were expelled.

I wanted this to be like that... I'm sad now.


TL;DR I wish a fight from junior high had repeated itself. 




 Isn't a preemptive edit just a post?
