 I wanna lick you.
 




 It's funny. I was thinking that you were a beautiful child when I looked at this. Even though you had long hair as a kid, still. 




 Um, you were always adorable. Dat smile.
 




 Neil Patrick Harris?

Also, you are attractive. Wow. 




 DAMN. 




 God you are so good at this. 




 Apparently, you look like several different celebrities. And asian. 




 That's gonna be one handsome little devil. 




 It was just before my 17th birthday. It was unprotected, in the laundry room, up against a dryer. We tried four different positions and lasted a good half hour, surprisingly, because it was the first time for both of us. And, 'til this day, the sight of a dryer turns me on. 




 Whyyyyy would someone downvote this. 




 Flushing the toilet. 




 When I read this, I read "evil-doer" as "evil-deer" 




 Holy crap. Please tell him that he looks gorgeous.

 i think /r/ladyboners would like you. 




 Your dog is Fizzgig. 




 For some reason I am imagining you drunk. 




 Well. I don't want my soup anymore.
 




 I think I puked, but I'm not sure because of the disgusting sensory overload this comment just gave me. 




 I almost shit my pants seeing my username. For two incredibly stupid and perhaps conceited seconds, I thought that this post was dedicated to me.
  




 I have so many, I can't even pick. I have nightmares every night. I am also a very vivid dreamer, which is nice when I'm having a good dream, but usually I'm not. Probably five nights out of seven I wake up and have a hard time differentiating between reality and non-reality because every detail in the dream is exactly the way it looks, feels, tastes, smells and sounds like in real life. It is perfect to the level of Inception. But I will tell three of my particularly disturbing dreams, in chronological order.

The first disturbing dream I remember happened when I was five years old. I had a dream that trees were mad that humans were using them for paper and our own selfish needs and so they revealed that they could talk (they actually looked a lot like the trees in the Wizard of Oz, except more menacing) and they took over the world. There were particular types of trees, like the birch and the sequoia (among others), that they had rejected because they were "peaceful" and didnt want to harm the humans. Anyway, the dominating tree types had put all humans in concentration camp-looking places and at meal times they gave us a plate with three different types of bark on it. Two  of the types were from the "dominating" tree races that had died naturally and the other was from the "lesser" trees that they had killed. If you were lucky youd get something like birch, because if you happened to eat the bark from the dominating trees, you were deemed unworthy to serve the trees because you were unable to differentiate between your "masters" and your "enemies." In the dream, I was sitting on my cousin's lap (she used to babysit me a lot) and I remember picking up my fork and pointing to each one. She had become great at telling the difference so she always helped me. She told me which one not to eat, and because I was a child, of course I ate that one. Immediately, the tree-guard standing by me picked me up and threw me into its gaping mouth. It digested me and I could feel my legs burning as I heard my cousin's hysterical screams. Then I woke up.

The second one was when I was about thirteen or fourteen. I had watched Disturbia with one of my friends and about a month later, I had this dream. I was sitting on the couch, watching static on the TV as it stormed outside. The way our house was set up, you could see all the way to the back door in the kitchen two rooms away from the living room. Lighting crashed and i saw a shadow of a man in the livingroom. I looked to the right and I saw the Killer from Disturbia staring into the glass of the back door. The light from the static on the TV barely reached him, so the shadows made his eyes look like empty sockets. We stared at each other for a good ten seconds before he opened his mouth ghoulishly wide and screamed in rage. He started trying to smash the window in and I bolted upstairs and leaped underneath the covers. In my dream, I poked my finger through one of the holes that was *actually in my covers in real life*. I pulled out some of the polyester filling nervously and started playing with it, hoping he wouldnt find me. Suddenly, I heard loud rapping on my window that was right across the room from my bed. It thundered again, and I realize now that this is when I woke up, but in real life I could still hear the rapping at the window, and I was still playing with the filler because I had taken it out in my sleep. I lied in bed for a good hour before I peeked out from under the covers and saw a tree branch tapping on my window and realized it wasn't real. My body ached for a couple days after that from that hour of tensing up in pure terror.

The last one I'll tell happened last night. I'll tell you an abridged version since this comment is already way too long. Basically, my boyfriend and I started living with these people who were in a cult and lived in the shittiest, low down abandoned house you can imagine. Think Fight Club but multiply the shittiness by about ten. I went into the bathroom in our room to wash my face, and i opened the mirrored cabinet door to find a cut up baby and its face was right on the level of my face. I was frozen. And then it smilled and laughed at me. Its mouth started spurting blood along with its other body parts. In the dream I had just found out I was pregnant.  




 I'm not sure if this is mean or not, but it made me really angry. I am not one bit overweight and my (now ex) boyfriend told me that I should work out because he "wanted to see what it was like" to see me smaller. And then he said, "If I dont like it, I'll tell you to gain weight back." Then, after a little more thinking on his part, he said, "Nevermind, I like you the way you are. Don't do anything."

I never said that I didnt like the way I looked or anything, and he never took into consideration what i wanted my body to look like. It was just as if he owned it and could tell me what to do with it.  




 No. 
Your cat's high. 




 The first song I heard by them was Panic Switch and I instantly obsessed, but then it sort of died out a little. I forgot about this song for a while and now im hooked again. 




 I know that feel, bro. I'm basically still a lurker, except I'm the Oprah of upvotes. 




 Does anyone know what I'm talking about when I say that this is maybe a million times worse than Talking Tina from The Twilight Zone? 




 I regularly babysat for my neighbor's daughter, and the day this happened was just a regular day. We were walking to the park, and in the parking lot she saw a puddle that had oil in it, which was making a rainbow. She looked at it and looked up at me to see that I had seen it as well. I smiled back at her. We didn't mention it for the rest of the night. It was just one of those mundane and seemingly insignificant occurrences.

I feel I should also mention that she hardly ever talked except to say something absolutely brilliant and creative, except she was a little morbid.

 I was scared to see her at night, since she looked like a typical little girl that should have been in a horror movie (blue eyes that pierced through your soul, pale with very dark brown hair that could have been black, nightgown etc.) and it was usually at night when she woke up to deliver one of these glimpses into her strange little mind.

She had gotten out of bed absolutely silently and had stepped slightly in  front of me, where I was sitting on the couch, watching TV. I jumped a little. Never got used to it.

She asked me, "That rainbow? That we saw on the ground today? It fell from the sky, and it died, didn't it?" Then she got really close to my face.  "And you just SMILED." 

I was too creeped out to go back there. Now when I see one of those puddles on the ground I get shudders. Her mind must be a scary place. 




 Best comment I have read all day. 




 Oh my god. These kids are terrible...it makes me wonder what kind of things they have experienced to be able to do that to someone...such bad things happen in this world.
