 It isn't. Commercially available solar cells have an efficiency of 17 to 20 percent, so there is only one fifth of the energy going into electricity. This is even under laboratory conditions. Rawlemon indicates they already be able to achieve an efficiency of more than 50 percent with the glass ball collectors right now. On a squarefoot photovoltaic surface, the prototypes already produces as much electricity as conventional systems generate with a much bigger surface - they are four times as effective.

The feds keep a portion for administrative costs, and the rest gets sent back to the department where they use it to purchase equipment and training for their drug program.

 FYI, it's the Shavit electric superbike. It is a final graduation project of an industrial designer from Shenkar college of design and engineering in Israel. The objective of his project is to design the ultimate everyday sportbike. This electric superbike has been designed with unique adjustable riding position system.  




 No, it's marvelicious!

 From the bar to the bedroom I'm swimming in the neon 

Lighted pictures of a redhead, plasticoated hot on 

And sometimes when that mirror shows 

The smile of disbelief 

Stained signature of nightmares 

They're stolen by the thief 

I'm back on the borderline 

Yes I'm back on the borderline 
 




 And everybody like: 'yeah!'

 The Otherland Series by Tad Williams. It was so hyped but its crappy. Have read all 4(?) books, it was so hart to read till the end cos i wanted to know, if there is a twist or something. Pro tip: read the first half oft the first book and the last half of the last. Thats enough (if you habe to read it anyway)
