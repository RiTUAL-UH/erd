 I need absolute quiet when I'm sleeping. Thats the reason I wear headphones to bed (it's done the trick til now). Rain sounds sooth me but I can't fall asleep with them. Thanks though! 




 whats a white noise machine? 




 Recently my flatmates have taken to watching tv on their laptop in the hall of our flat. There are three of them and it only started happening recently. They put on youtube clips of movies, songs (and sing a long with them) and talk really loudly. Sometimes they scream and one tends to shriek a lot. Sometimes I can hear them running up and down the flat chasing eachother like children. FYI - no drinking involved.
Usually I put up with it but when I have a 9am lecture (and I know that none of them are in until around 12pm) I can tell its gonna be a long night. I shouldn't have to put up with this though right?
Also I have depression to getting sleep is really important. I have said to them nicely that I was trying to sleep (that was last night) and they quietened down but I'm afraid that they will be more bitchy to me if I come out and say it on a regular basis. 
BUT ITS FUCKING ANNOYING!
So what do I do? This is uni accomodation so I have to stay til June and can't change flats (another flatmate of ours applied ages ago because of them and was told there is none) 




 I do. I feel guilty because I have had nothing in my life was truly traumatic (though my bio dad did stop contact with me when I was 9) or horrifying in my life to make me feel this way. I also have nothing to be sad for. I am university, have enough money and then some to get by and live a 'decent' life. So why do I feel like I hate my life  that I'd be better off dead? It makes no sense to me but it is what it is.
