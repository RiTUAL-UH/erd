 IT'S WHAT I REMEMBER WALT!! 




 I did. Scroll down. 




 Walter, have you ever drank shots of liquid cocaine and Jack Daniels? 
Walt, it was closing time and when closing time happens, legs open.... 




 Da fuck? 




 I agree. I dropped the book when I glanced at the cover and said "What the fuck?" really loud.
Yeah, I took the pic when I dropped it. Someone placed it in the Sci-Fi aisle. 




 What is your impression of the cover art? 




 I fucked a fat chick and didn't know until the next day. Woke up naked in the bed, used the phone on her night stand to call friend, message on phone said "Dial 1 and area code for the number you are dialing", jump up, find phone book from Kansas. 
I live in Tennessee. 




 Long story short : It all started with a bookshelf and naked pics of them both. 




 That is weird as fuck.  




 Says the guy who posts on /r/sexyabortions 




 LOL a pervert because the art on the cover made me go "What the fuck?"
Jesus, get the pitchforks out over weird cover art? 




 My Wife! My Daughter! Are sick...and you talk about coupon?

 No. Just Black Hulk.
 














 They pay for postage? 




 Idea I had a few years ago that crossed my mind. See, you know how DC always fucks up the Archie superhero universe? 
I had this crazy thought about rebooting Archie Comics into a superhero universe.
Riverdale? Big as New York? Archie Andrews?
Well, he is the Fly. The Golden Age,Silver Age,etc. All of the past Crusaders, Shield,Blue Ribbon Comics stuff has happened, but rebooting Archie would have him on par with Spider-Man as the Fly (the rookie superhuman dealing with experienced heroes). 




 Have 2nd appearence of Deadpool for grabs if needed. Went up in price big time.

 So, are you people uploading or downloading? Downloading is not the same as uploading.
Downloading is OK. Uploading is not.

 I am still buying the soap on the rope for my jailed cousin. That fucker deserves some laughs.... 




 How Can Our Eyes Be Real If Soap Bubbles Of Reality Are Real? 




 That's what Ebola is for... 




 Our universe is soap bubbles in the bath of God. 









 So anyone whos been on the /v/ board at 4chan. probably knows about Mr. Bones Wild Ride. For those who dont, it was a ride someone made for Roller Coaster Tycoon. It was one of those really slow motor car rides but with a twist. It had 30,696 feet of track and a ride time of 70 real time minutes, around four years ingame time. In addition there were those props of the skeleton holding out his top hat scattered around here and there, as if to mock the customers. Needless to say, there were a lot of passengers screaming I WANT TO GET OFF MR. BONES WILD RIDE!
Now heres where things get really good. Once the ride came to a stop, the passengers found themselves on a long path that took about 2 hours to traverse. Once they reached the end, they found themselves facing a sign that read Mr. Bones says: The ride never ends!
The path lead straight back to the entrance of Mr. Bones Wild Ride. There was nowhere else to go. In other words, they were fucked. Needless to say this gained a lot of popularity on /v/ and people started making their own Mr. Bones Wild Ride. I was one of them and made a version with the ghost train ride. You know the one thats usually a huge death trap. It didnt last as long as the original but it did have a twist. Near the end it launched the cars into a small shed with a sign on the side that said Enjoy your stay! I killed about 20 people with that ride and laughed my ass off as they each went one by one to their graves.
Fast forward a few weeks and I was in Busch Gardens on vacation. I was wandering around trying to decide what to ride. Thats when I noticed a ride that hadnt been there the last time I visited. It was weird because it had never been advertised and there was nothing on the map about it. I figured what the hell and got in line.
Surprisingly the line wasnt very long. I only waited about 10 minutes to get on. It was one of those motor car rides which is kind of weird because they already had one elsewhere in the park. Why would they open up a second one? After buckling in I looked up ahead and froze. There was a giant skeleton up ahead tipping a hat to me with a sign over his head. No I whispered. The sign read Mr. Bones Wild Ride.
I struggled with my restraints but they wouldnt come off. I begged the employee contolling the ride to help and that I had changed my mind but he ignored me. My car started moving and I screamed in terror. Up ahead the track stretched on for what seemed like forever. I WANT TO GET OFF MR. BONES WILD RIDE!

 I got some Garbage Pail Kids Mini-Kins today and had an idea of a Multiverse game concept of Marvel Vs. DC vs. Iron Maiden with innocent bystanders such as the Garbage Pail Kids minikins, MUSCLE figures,etc. What would you use as innocent bystanders in a game? 














 I got a bunch of random items I want to trade and been looking for a decent trade site to place them on. (Comics, Metal Cassettes,etc.)

My local Craigslist isn't a great source for sports cards and I rather trade them through the mail. Local dealer here doesn't carry 80s-00s star cards and the rest of the local Craigslist guys highball their sports cards. 

Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!
