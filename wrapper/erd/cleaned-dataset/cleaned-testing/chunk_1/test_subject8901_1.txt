 This whole "neckbeard" thing seems to be a growing trend. Are they trying grooming their facial hair to look like this, or is it actually their best effort to grow facial hair? As for fedoras, I have no clue why someone who isn't in a swing band would wear one. 
























 Just wondering if he's still out there. His performance was always my favourite thing about Friday night.

 Please no upboats, updogs, uprons, or ronvotes. Thanks you in advance for the gold, kind stranger.

EDIT 2: Keep the questions coming, Reddit! 









 EDIT: Thank you for the Golden Girls, Blanche Dubois!
