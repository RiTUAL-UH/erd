 Why zero research skills? I'm looking for the stuff that is not easily found. Yea I've typed in "best beaches San Diego" in Google, but I'm looking for the local specialties. 




 Oh yea, I'm completely aware. I plan on attending all law networking events available. Are you in the law industry? Do you have any specific suggestions for getting a leg up? 




 Thanks for the laugh. I'm sure I'll hear them 1000 more times. +1 




 Hey guys, me and my girlfriend just moved to the area from Texas. We are both attending law school. I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions on pretty much everything: beaches to visit, clubs to see downtown, restaurants to eat at, and anything else you can think of. Thank you in advance, sorry to invade. 




 Even better there's a computer program that can draw districts in the "shortest spitline." It is completely unbiased and draws it where the amount of people fit in the lines. 




 Call up the contact from that website again and say you never signed a lease and request that the website requests proof of a signed lease and if none is provided then it be removed from your history. If you pay a lawyer a small fee, they will probably write it for you which will be a lot scarier for this website and likely make them more responsive. 




 Just in case adoptive kids read this part and see "chose not to abandon me when that would have been the easy choice," I would like to point out that many families who choose to adopt out their children are making the choice to do so to give the kid a better life, and simply don't have the solid family structure you were blessed to have. Most adoptive parents see it as their suffering for the betterment of the child. 




 www.bigwords.com and type in all your ISBN numbers, then click to include international editions. It will tell you where to buy the cheapest bundle of all your books, and you can include rentals and everything. 




 So still don't go to a low ranked law school and if you go to a high ranked school make sure you go with a big scholarship. This is the same advice you would have been given in 2011. Would anyone here have told a student not to attend a top 30 school with a big scholarship even then?

 Go check out the discussion over on /r/MMA, this very thing happened yesterday with a male fighter finding his girlfriend in bed with another guy. Complete opposite reactions. 




 I'm sure most of the people here don't follow the sport mixed martial arts but just to fill everyone in, there is a fighter named War Machine (real name), who is dating a porn star and he reportedly beat her after finding her in bed with another guy. Over on /r/MMA, there has been lots of discussion of this and the consensus is it's wrong no matter what he found her doing. Anyway I just wanted to point out that the double standards are pretty sickening. 




 I would offer no more than 20%. I realize that is drastically different than what you were thinking, but realize that your friend is only bringing the good credit. That's nothing. You could find that with a Craigslist ad coupled with an attorney written contract giving you all the rights to revenue, and I assure you many people with only credit would take that. 




 Just curious, but what's the split? 




 George RR Martin is pretty unhealthy and will probably die before he finishes Game of Thrones. 




 Agreed. Let's look at 2 other scenarios: 1) Someone wants to frame him. If they wanted to frame him for cheating there are a hell of a lot better ways to do it than setting up profiles with his picture and fake names and minimal info (which is what he says is on the accounts) then just HOPING that his wife or one of her friends finds the accounts and rats him out. 2) It's some guy who thinks OP is of godly looks and is using his profile to pull in chicks. In this case, they got his pictures off FB. OK Cupid and such are LOCAL websites. What are the odds that this random dude using his random pictures would set up profiles within his same exact 50 mile radius.

On the other hand, if he wants to cheat while out of town on business, he would probably be setting up profiles in those cities, not his own. And it is possible that the wife's friend who "found out" set them up if she has a personal vendetta against OP. Or even that one of OP's friends set up the profile with his picture and is using it to bait in girls. I just think these are less likely than OP being a cheater.

Honestly, I have no idea, but I'm leaning more towards the fact that this post is just to get ideas for a cover up. 




 I just realized how much Zach Braff will look like Ray Romano in 20 years. 




 Whatever you're comfortable with. Extremely risky: 15%, average risk: 7%, super safe: 5% as examples. 




 Wouldn't it be even smarter then to make your whole ad 5 seconds long then just black screen the rest of the time? Then the person sees your whole ad but and will always skip after its over and you never have to pay. 




 Define the odd phone calls.

As for reserving a room, she was heading to the mountains, of course she is reserving a room. She's not gonna party out in the woods. 




 Why not just wait another few months until Aldo is ready and do Edgar/Swanson in the meantime for #1 contender? 




 You know it always really bugs me that they never count Aldo's defenses from WEC in there. I mean the WEC FW division became the UFC FW division and was seen as the premier place for FW's even when it was the WEC. They should say Zuffa belt defenses, or even UFC/WEC belt defenses, not just UFC belt defenses.

Aldo has held the belt longer than Jones and had more defenses. Granted the competition hasn't been up to par with Jones' but people always cite stats like these to show why Aldo is above Jones in P4P rankings. 




 Although I completely disagree with charging anyone for any crime here, if they insist on charging the underage boy shouldn't they also charge the underage girl with possession and manufacturing of child pornography especially since she started it? 




 I mean that one sounds pretty straightforward, no?

Theory: Girl invited to party, empties bank account b/c she's an irresponsible college undergrad, buys alcohol b/c of same reason, drinks on the way up, hits snow b/c drunk, tells person not to call police b/c she was drunk driving, then hitchhikes with the wrong person and gets murdered.

I mean they found red stains that they assume are from red wine. Of course she didn't want police called after she crashed while drinking and driving. 




 If it is truly valued at $200K now and $220K with $15K worth of work, but I doubt it. It's much more likely that $20K worth of work will cause it to sell for $220K. The market is very good at being efficient. I am a former real estate agent and my suggestion would be to sell it as-is, unless all other condos in the area are selling with improvements, and yours is not, then act accordingly. 




 "Proceed." 




 Exactly, Nader can warn all he wants against Clinton but I'd rather have Clinton than abortion made illegal again, no chance for gay marriage, no chance for further healthcare reform, less investment in green energy, and no minimum wage reform. 




 What country, or if in the US what industry? 




 Dana has routinely paid both guys if there is a last minute cancellation. 




 That's actually still not entrapment. The law defines entrapment as a police officer convincing a citizen to commit a crime they would not have otherwise committed AND that a reasonable person would not commit.

An example of actual entrapment: A police officer runs up to a person on the street yelling they have just been poisoned and there is an antidote in that store, but the store is closed and he must break a window and take the antidote. The citizen is arrested after he breaks in and steals the antidote.

A reasonable person would steal the antidote, but not buy crack even after being harassed. 




 Just read the whole story and watched your trailer. It looks really cool! Where will you be posting it? Like which subreddit? 




 These people probably shouldn't be driving... 




 Yea this was baffling. The dad disputes the kid did anything wrong then grounds him? Sounds like he's taking out his anger over getting arrested on the kid. 




 How did the dad support multiple kids with a job a McDonalds is the real question? 




 Technically, it means she would potentially sleep with any guy with a girlfriend, her boyfriend included, but not exclusively. 




 Yeeeesh that was brutal. The most interesting part by far was the fact that SPOILER ALERT: the guy's wants to kill himself after the accident and everybody's saying let him kill himself if he wants to die and is in that much pain, then he goes on to make a fantastic recovery with wife, kids, and attend law school. 




 Life and Death Decisions

Awesome teacher, awesome class, super interesting. Extremely informative. Easy tests. Opt out of the final. Man I could go on and on about that class.

Edit: And no presentation or speeches. 




 Incoming 1L taking this advice to heart right now. I appreciate the sacrifice. 




 If many people in the company are entitled to it then I think your best bet would be for you guys to all meet together with a lawyer and outline the story and see if you have a case.

Other posters are right, $400 for one person isn't worth a lawsuit, but for 20+ people, it is more reasonable.

Most of the time, a simple letter from a lawyer would be enough to scare the company into complying. 




 Hi.

I'll preface this with the fact that I'm not an excon and I only subscribed to this sub because I'm interested. However I am a undergraduate who is heading into a graduate program this Fall so I know things from that side a tiny bit.

I have been in the legal system for minor charges, some of which I pleaded not guilty and they dropped immediately after and one of which I went to court and was proven not guilty by a jury.

It was a minor charge that I beat in court and I was 100% guilty of it, and I was a 19 year old pompous kid, but it was a misdemeanor Minor in Possession charge so I don't feel too bad for misrepresenting some stuff.

The major fact I took away was, it's not what is true, it's what appears true. Like that Training Day quote where Denzel talks about "It's what you can prove."

Well, what I'm getting from your case is that there is little "proof" on either side. Do the discovery, find out what they have on you. Also did you take pictures or any proof of your injuries?

Now you go up on the stand, look as innocent as possible, seem exasperated and just be emotional and work in to the jury that you just don't want to go to jail for something you didn't do and the other damage it's had on your life. SEEM innocent.

After it's over 1 of 2 things will happen: Not Guilty, you walk away learning a valuable lesson or Guilty and you go to jail most likely and when you get out, you talk to any employers and tell them the full story and hope one of them believes your story. Now let me tell you what you get if you just plead Guilty. Most likely, employers will not believe if you tell them you are not really guilty but plead guilty because you were scared. Unless they are in the position, it's almost impossible for people to comprehend that people will plead guilty to a crime they did not commit. Again this is all just my opinion and you are free to do whatever you want.

Also, I don't know about you, but for me I would not be able to plead guilty purely based on principle. I would rather do a year I got sentenced to after a full trial than 6 months I plead guilty to.

I would like to add one last note that I am not a typical poster here and I have never been to jail/prison so I am likely talking out of my ass when I say I would rather do the year I didn't earn than the 6 months I condemned myself to, but this is all just an opinion for you to take into account and decide for yourself.

In any case, good luck man. I sincerely hope you the truth prevails. 




 Can you stop downvoting me just because you disagree?

And that's not a response. You're just dodging the question but whatever fine. 




 Just to be clear: you are saying you don't think he needs even a few thousand though in case his car breaks down or there is a medical emergency, because that is what I advocated for and you seemed to disagree. Is that right? 




 It would be naive to think his expense are $0. He obviously pays for lunch, most likely his gas and probably insurance, entertainment, etc.

He should obviously have money for the loan payments and/or a car breaking down AT THE MINIMUM. Are you advocating he have no emergency fund because we assume his parents can/would help him? 




 I disagree. I think 6 months of whatever his expenses may be is appropriate. If that is only food, gas, phone and insurance then I think he should save 6 months of that, which would only presumably be around $3500 or so. And everyone wants an emergency fund that size if for example their car breaks down or something of that nature. 




 I'm sure even you miss a line here and there when casually browsing reddit. Or no? 




 Just remember:

1) Make a budget
2) Emergency fund with 6 months expenses
3) EMERGENCY FUND WITH 6 MONTHS EXPENSES
4) Put all excess in student loans 




 So highly paid, elite athletes get paid more? 




 When they wrote "his address" in the article, those words were hyperlinked to his actual address. 




 Used to watch every UFC, the whole card through, every pre and post press conference, watch every interview, and even watch the 2nd tier promotions (DREAM, Strikeforce, etc) but now I watch only the main cards of some of the UFCs, not really the TUF Finales or anything like that. 




 Just to piggyback on the top comment, even if a drug with euphoric effects was created that didn't have any physical adverse effects, it would still have mental adverse effects.

Imagine a drug that produces a high and you never have to worry about ODing or having a hangover or any other health effects. Would you take it every day? Would you spend your last dollar on it instead of eating some days? Would you steal in order to get money for it? 




 It's better than the previous status quo. Pre-existing conditions and no medicare just because you don't have a kid, not to mention lifetime caps and being dropped by your insurance if you develop a condition. 




 More like pacman. 




 The salesman thing lines up with what others said in the other thread. Have him attempt to get a job at a home improvement store. As said in the other thread they like to hire older people and he has sales experience and they can teach him the tools part. 




 I don't understand how the judge could possibly deny the biological father the right to be named on the birth certificate.

I feel like that happens all the time in cases of straight couples using surrogacy. 




 They put their sperm with an egg of a donor woman, then implanted that fertilized egg in a 3rd woman.

Also, why do you not support it? 




 I'm pretty sure it's going to depend on the dynamics of the child with the parents. If the child is indifferent towards the dad but close to the mom, and the dad has full time custody then the child will be unhappy and vice versa.

My parents had 50/50 custody when I was in elementary school and it was the absolute worst. Literally every day I was asking who would pick me up and occasionally the parent who was supposed to pick me up would forget.

The only thing I can say for sure that if this is studied, 50/50 is most likely to be the worst. 




 Agreed. I think he could have beaten Texiera if he had his head in the game. He just got to overconfident, just like against Lyoto. Although I do think he would have lost to Lyoto even if he hadn't rushed in. 




 The Keith Jardine fight?

I don't recall them being legal, are you sure?

Edit: 1:30 mark http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hl475QNxCM
Definitely illegal. 




 PS3 reporting in. Not gonna spend $400 just to spend $60 as much as I want to play this game. 




 staph, just FYI 




 No, nothing has changed. Can you provide a video or rough time period in a fight where an upkick that connected to the head of a down opponent was no called by a ref? 




 Hey, so you seem to have it down pretty well. But I have one last suggestion. Do your parents have bad credit at all?

If they apply for a PLUS loan and get denied, you are able to take additional unsubsidized Stafford loans in your own name only, and at a good interest rate (comparatively to private loans).

If not, then just go private loans with your parents as cosigners. 




 That was $12K each year. The guy has 2 years left, he should be able to take a break for 2 years before working the rest of his life. 




 Hey guys, I was one of the redditors who helped Tim Kennedy do his AMA.

Just FYI, he said they have about 30 fighters ready for DLC content and are just gonna be adding fighters as they go. 




 I'm not sure if /u/Mr_asdfghjkl was implying it was a bitch move because of the circumstances or just in general but I'll throw out my thoughts.

I would like to see soccer kicks/stomps legalized but it was still a bitch move because it was illegal, and the other guy knew it was. If it was legal, it wouldn't be a bitch move. 




 The Sims and GTA5

I want to lead a normal family life with a job as an accountant, then go out and rob banks with my crew on weekends. 




 There are 7 different last names in his list of grandparents, parents, and children. 




 You think Republicans will have a 2/3 majority in the House AND Senate? You're wrong. 




 I was the other guy who helped with the AMA at Tim's house. I asked for a pic and he immediately asked for a leg kick at "about a 7 or an 8" out of 10. Looked like it hurt. 




 Because Dems have the Senate and nothing Democrats really really hate would ever get through the Senate and thus he would never be able to veto it. Trust me, if they start passing stuff that the Dems don't want, he will veto it. 




 Still won't matter. Obama will veto anything that makes it through and R's don't have 2/3 majority in House and Senate. 




 Dude had some hilarious answers for his AMA. I was cracking up typing some of them. 




 Hey guys I was one of the guys he chose to help with his AMA just cause I live in Austin. He was a really cool dude! Me and the other guy just helped type up responses while he dictated, but we typed it word for word. He gave us each a signed glove and we got to see his dogs and meet his wife. He seems really down to earth. I got a pic with him, and the other guy asked Tim to give him a leg kick (there was a video, I'll let him post it if he wants). 




 The Republican nominee and Democratic nominee for this race are both teachers at the same college. 




 Out of the 6 people living in that house, 5 are unclassy and you are alright with 1. 




 I'm gonna be working there tomorrow from 7-7!

I get to serve the athletes and their families food. 




 I just saw the first showing of this movie today, opening day, and WOW it was a really great movie. Not what I expected. Tom Cruise actually played a type of character I had never seen him as before.

He wasn't the futuristic guy from Oblivion, nor the super-agent type from that one movie with Cameron Diaz. Cruise was scared, unsure of himself and a refreshingly great character. The movie itself shattered all of my expectations, which weren't great as I didn't expect much and went on student discount Thursday night as I didn't think it was worth full price, but oh how wrong I was.

Also, the comedy, my god I was laughing out loud at many parts in the movie and you will too.

Seriously go see it and thank me later.

Sidenote: There's another disaster movie coming out in a very 2012-ish vein and it looks even worse.

 I have loans from undergrad: subsidized govt, unsubsidized govt and unsub private. Will the subsidized ones continue to be subsidized while I am in grad school (law school) as long as I am full time?

I am going straight from undergrad to law school. Do I have to notify any of the loan servicers (even the private ones) that I will still be in school or will they be automatically notified so that my payment period does not start? 














 All my acceptances are starting to come in and while I have a great GPA, I only did decently on the LSAT and I'm looking at going to a lower-ish ranked school.

My question is: While looking at the ABA profiles of schools, I noticed some have really high attrition rates. They break it down by "Academic" and "Other" but also have Transfers Out. Are transfers out counted in attrition rates? If so, which category? Does Academic mean failed out or does Other? I searched google and the ABA website and could not find the answers to these questions.

I know it is generally frowned upon for 0L's to post here, but I think this question can help a lot of others. Thanks for taking the time. 









 Sorry if I'm posting in the wrong place. Perhaps I could be directed to the correct place if this is not the right subreddit.

Here's my problem. Yesterday, all at once, the clock stopped working in my car (the little LED one that is right next to the temperature display, which still works), the remote that locks/unlocks the car no longer works, the trunk button in the car does not open the trunk, and when I turn my car off, usually I can still close the windows, but now I have to have the car on to close the windows.

I've checked all fuses. I've check the battery. Everything is good. The car is a 1998 Toyota Avalon.

Perhaps one of you more knowledgeable folks might point me in the right direction? I don't know much about cars and any help in appreciated. 














 I'm just confused, because California could have just put up a shitty defense, then the losing side would appeal up to the SCOTUS and they would be FORCED to make a decision. By striking down DOMA, we can ascertain that the Court clearly have the votes in favor of marriage equality. 









 Hey /r/MMA, so I'm in summer courses majoring in economics and currently taking an upper division Economics Statistics course. Well, my teacher assigned us a project (I only have a brief overview of it now, will have exact details of it tomorrow) to do a numerical statistics analysis on discrete numerical data in which our sample size is over 30. She specifically said we could do it in sports. Obviously as a huge MMA fan, I'd like to do mine in MMA.

So I'm looking for everyone's input on some cool statistics I could analyze and I will of course share the full results of the project with everyone here so that could be cool right?

To cover a quick few things:
1. it has to be numerical, not categorical so I cannot do things such as types of finishes;
2. it has to be discrete meaning a specific number (ex. # of strikes per round, not weight of each fighter- which fluctuates);
3. sample size has to be over 30 so if I'm analyzing one person's fights it has to be someone with more than 30 of them, but I could analyze all champions fights; 
4. I don't want this to be a comparison across weight classes where there are already many predictable patterns;
5. don't pitch an idea that is insanely hard such as analyzing every single fighter in the UFC for the past 10 years;
6. keep in mind I can also analyze #'s that aren't takedowns, strikes, etc. such as viewers for shows, salaries and more.


Thanks! And I look forward to sharing the project with you guys! 




 Not sure if this is the right sub but.... I'm looking at law schools and when I see them according to US News, it show's the average indebtedness at graduation for each school. My question is: does this include undergraduate debt as well?

The definition provided on the website states: "Average indebtedness of 2012 graduates who incurred law school debt." As you can see, this does not clear up my issue. So if anyone with any insight can help, I'd be thankful. 




 Hi, I am a student and subleased my apartment for the summer. Over Craigslist, I met a Law Student (ironically) who agreed to sublease my room. He moved in and lived there from the 12 until 25th of May (today) and when rent was due, he sent me a text saying he has moved out. He said I could keep the deposit and left a $100 check for utilities from the time he lived there (it was only like $40). I immediately texted back asking if he could call to discuss it. He responded, declining.

I went to the apartment and found the check as well as him completely moved out. My question is, do I have legal recourse as he signed a lease in which I explicitly outline the deposit, rent amount, move in and move out dates, and he signed and sent a copy of his drivers license? He signed this agreement and I have emails from his official .edu email address in which he signs his full name and has his schools listed at the bottom. I also have texts confirming his move in date and confirmation that the lease was signed.

A friend told me that I could possibly be out of luck as I did not get the contract notarized. Is this true or does it simply decrease my chances of winning a judgement from him, considering I have the emails, texts, drivers license, and signed contract (signed by both of us)?

I live in Texas, and the reason he cited for moving out was originally that the hot water and dishwasher don't work (they do) and when I called him out on that he said the place wasn't clean (it was reasonably vacuumed, swept, and counters wiped when he moved in). He is now not responding to any texts of mine in which I ask him to call me. I have not threatened the lawsuit yet, but I plan on filing in small claims court as of Tuesday (Monday is a holiday).

Thank you all for your time and help. 









 ***Hi guys, I am an American student taking Danish here in Texas. I know lots of you have helped me before editing my papers and I want to thank you guys. I am now on my very last paper for Danish, and after this I just take the oral exam and written final exam and I am done with my Danish studies. I want to thank this subreddit as a whole for helping me learn Danish, and a special thanks to /u/Neovitami and /u/Solgudinde who have helped edit many of my papers. I just didn't want to keep burdening them, so I come to you all for my last paper.

The topic for this paper is about a vacation we want to go on. I went away from the topic a bit and wrote about an adventure I wish to have. If you just edit it by bolding my mistakes (spelling and grammar) I would be very thankful.***


Den ferie jeg nsker, er at bestige Mount Everest. Det ligger i Nepal. Det har vret min drm lige siden jeg var lille til st p toppen af verden. Jeg har planlagt denne ferie i lang tid, og det bliver meget spndende, nr jeg har penge til at tage. Jeg bliver ndt til spare op masser og masser af penge, fr jeg kan rejser der. Og s jeg bliver ndt til finde en guide, der vil hjlpe med at guide mig op bjerget. Jeg bliver ogs ndt til at trne. Jeg skal have masser af erfaring klatring andre bjerge, fr jeg kan forsge til bestige det hjeste en. Jeg bliver ndt til spise rigtigt, s jeg kan vre meget sundt. Jeg vil spise masser af frugt og grntsager, og jeg vil g lber hver dag. Sidste til at blive klar til min eventyr, vil jeg ndt til samle det rigtige udstyr. Jeg vil kbe en klatring kse, klatring sko, og masser af varmt tj. Jeg vil ogs kbe en srlig sovepose og telt. Og jeg kan ikke glemme at kbe en brndeovn at lave mad varme mltider!

Frst jeg vil flyve p et fly til Kathmandu, hovedstaden i Nepal. S vil jeg vandre fra Kathmandu til Everest basislejr. Denne vandretur er omkring 100 kilometer lang og tager ca 4 dage. S jeg vil bo i basislejr i 10 dage eller deromkring. Dette vil give min lunge at akklimatisere sig til den hje hjde, basislejr ligger p. S jeg klatre til Camp 1, s Camp 2, derefter Camp 3, da Camp 4, og endelig til topmdet! Hele eventyr vil tage omkring en mned for at afslutte. Det vil ogs koste en masse penge! Men jeg vil fle sig en stor flelse af realisering, s det vil vre umagen vrd for mig.
Mens andre mennesker nsker at rejser p ferier, hvor de kan slappe af, lide i Caribien, jeg nsker at rejser p en ferie, hvor jeg kan opleve en stor liv eventyr.

Jeg har boet i Austin hele mit liv. Byen er vokset meget siden jeg blev fdt her. Jeg elsker Austin. Jeg tror, det er den bedste by i verden. Den har alle fordelene ved at bo i Texas, men det er meget forskelligt fra andre byer i Texas. Austin er stor nok, at det er interessant, men lille nok til at det er let at kre fra den ene ende til den anden hurtigt. Austin er den mest unikke by jeg har hver besgt, og jeg er stolt af at bo her.

Jeg elsker Austin, fordi der er altid noget at gre. Der er masser af butikker for at kbe ting i. I Austin, kan du tage vandreture p Greenbelt. Eller du kan sejle p sen. Eller du kan kre rundt sporet p Town Lake. Der er ogs mange steder fantastisk til datoer. Du kan tage til Mount Bonnell og se solnedgangen. Eller du kan fodre nderne i Zilker Park. Hvis du nsker at feste, er der masser af barer p 6th street. Der er ogs masser af levende musik i barer og klubber. En anden aktivitet at gre, er at besge det Texas State Capitol og lre alt om historien af Texas.

Jeg elsker ogs at i Austin, der er masser af aktiviteter at gre p ferie. I marts kan du se live musik og film p South By Southwest festival. I marts kan du ogs flyve med drager p Austin Kite Festival. I juli kan du se fyrvrkeri p Town Lake for 4. juli fester. I september kan du tage til Zilker Park og deltage Austin City Limits, en kmpe musikfestival. I december kan du tage p Trail of Lights og se masser af juledekorationer.

Og sidst, har vi det bedste universitet i hele Texas, University of Texas, hvor du kan lre noget, selv dansk! 




 This happened about 4-5 hours ago. So here it is, several days after Valentines day and I'm walking on my college campus with my girlfriend to go pick up a package her mom had sent her containing lots of Valentines day candy and such.

Well we pick up the package and walk about 20 feet when out of NOWHERE a tall skinny kid about 18-20 years old comes running and grabs the package from my hands. But here's the thing, **he's maniacally laughing the entire time.** First thought that entered my mind is I'm trying to see if I know the kid from class or a club or something, nope. Quick glance to my girlfriend next to me says she doesn't know him either.

So then after about 20 seconds of trying to grab the package, he rips it open and candy goes flying everywhere. At this point, we are in the middle of the hallway in one of the busiest buildings on campus. The kid starts trying to wrestle me. Sweet. I trained in MMA for about a year, so I know some stuff. I immediately go for a trip takedown, and when he puts his hands on the floor to stand up, I sink in a rear naked choke. First  I'm not squeezing that hard, but then I get pissed thinking how much of a pain he caused me. By the way, I'm borderline sick today and the only reason I even went to school was because I had a huge test. Add this to the fact that I'm lugging around a 30 pound backpack with books, binders and laptop, and you could see why I'm pissed when someone tries this crap on me. So here I am, applying the choke, and all these college kids (about 30 or so) have formed a big circle around me and a bunch of girls start screaming that I'm gonna kill him, and I can tell I'm about to put him to sleep, so I loosen the choke.

Oh and I've got my 30 pound backpack on this whole time. I guess here is where I should mention that I'm about 5'7 and 130 pounds and this kid is about 6'0 and 200 pounds. Needless to say he's got some size on me. So I've loosened the choke, but I'm still holding it firm but not squeezing at all. The kids starts grabbing my hair and just pulling the crap out of it. The girls are still yelling that I'm gonna kill this kid. So I start arguing with them, telling them he's gonna run if I let him go. They keep screaming at me. Fine. I let go, and hold firm around his waist. He stands up and starts dragging me, while standing, trying to run away. I implore any bystanders to help, and these two big-ish guys help me hold him there.

Finally, an employee of the college shows up and informs us that the police are on their way, but he can't touch the kid. So this kid is still dragging the 3 of us around and we're trying to hold him. Finally, we agree that we'll put him on the ground. So we ground the kid and he just starts unloading punches at me, mostly top of the head, but some hit me in the jaw (which is now sore and slightly swollen). College employee jumps in and helps us hold him down til police get there.

They take, my, my girlfriend's and some other witness statements. At this point I hear a bystander mention that they know the kid and he's mentally ill. Crap, I should have realized earlier. Now the police pull me aside and start grilling me, asking me if I thought the kid was an imminent threat to me and actively trying to harm me. I point to the fact that he punched me in the head several times. Then the officer informs me that I could be arrested for applying "deadly force" in the form of the choke, which is a felony. Pshhh, I tell him, that's complete BS, dude tried to rob me.

So it ends with me telling the police that yes I'd like to press charges for assault and attempted robbery. And the police informing me that they will contact me and the kid may try to press assault charges on me. By the way, before someone complains, I'm only pressing charges because clearly this kid is either off his meds or on the wrong ones and they need to be adjusted. If his doctor informs me that they have fixed the medication and he is indeed taking them, and I get an apology from the kid, I will gladly drop the charges against him.

**tl;dr: Kid tries to rob me, I choke him, he punches me, whoops he's mentally ill, cops come and tell me I might be arrested for a felony in the near future; ALL LEGAL ADVICE WELCOME** 




 On my last paper I got a bad grade because my grammar was bad. Would anyone be willing to proofread my paper for mistakes?

Here is the paper:

Jeg s det program hedder Horisont: Liv og dd. Det var i fjernsynet p sndag, klokken 21:55. Det er 24 minutter langt.

Filmen handler om abort i Irland. Demonstranter der gr ind for abort er vist. Nogle kvinder er vist, som gr ind for valg. De nsker abort rettigheder, fordi der nu er ingen rettigheder for de kvinder til abort. Der er kun rettigheder for fosteret. Reporter interviewer en mand. Manden siger, at hans kone havde graviditet komplikationer. Manden siger, at lgen fortalt ham graviditeten var en spontan abort. S en lge interviewes hvem siger, at irsk lov siger, at lgen ikke kan abort et foster, hvis mors liv ikke er i fare. S interviewe manden, der siger deres lge fortalte ham, at de ikke kan abort fosteret, fordi det er live.

Reporter interviewer en kvinde, der er en anti-abort demonstrant. Kvinden mener deres protester beskytte ufdte fostre. Et fjernsyn interview er vist med republikansk senator Todd Akin. Senatoren siger, at han tror, hvis en kvinde er voldtaget, hendes krop vil aborterer fosteret.

Reporteren er vist interviewe en anonym irsk kvinde. Kvinden siger, at hun tog til England for at f en abort. Kvinden siger, at for hende turen var god.

Reporteren viser os et sted, hvor forldre, der ikke nsker deres brn kan opgive dem. Stedet har mange anti-abort plakater. Katolske nonner administrere stedet. Nonnerne stte brnene op til vedtagelse.

Et interview med en pro-choice kvinde vises. Hun siger, at regeringen i Irland gr love for abort og anti-abort love ogs. Regeringen fortstter med at forbyde abort, selv med mange protester mod abort love.
Lge Peter Boylan siger, at han tror Irland skulle debat abort nu. Han siger, at for 20 r siden, ville regeringen ikke lytte, men nu regeringen skal lytte.

Filmen slutter med at vise den mand, hvis kone dde, fordi lgen ngtede at gre en abort. Filmen er meget trist og flelsesmssige, og sger at ndre betragterens sind, hvis de er anti-abort.
 




 Just watching his interview (http://www.mmafighting.com/2012/12/5/3734168/rory-macdonald-plans-on-annihilating-hurting-and-destroying-b-j-penn) and the UFC on Fox 5 pre-fight press conference (http://www.mmafighting.com/2012/12/6/3732750/ufc-on-fox-5-press-conference-video) I can't help but get the feeling that Rory has the demeanor of Fedor except that Fedor actually smiles, and Rory is just... cold. I absolutely love his attitude and sincerely hopes he takes over at WW soon. 









 So I know it causes uninhibited growth which forms tumors, but how do the tumors kill you? Do they get large enough to block blood flow or what? 




 The limit represents the derivative of some function f at some number a. State such an f and a.

lim as h approaches 0  (fourth root(16 + h) - 2)/h



My answer: I got that a is 2, but I can't for the life of me get f. 




 So my internet is fine for everything but videos. On youtube, you know how it loads only the next 30 seconds until you press play, then continues loading? Well over that entire 30 seconds it maybe loads another 5 seconds, so I have to watch that 35 seconds, then sit there for another 2 minutes while it loads the next 30 seconds.

As you can imagine this gets pretty painful. But the kicker is I know its only my computer. My roommate's laptop loads the exact same videos fine with no pauses and we are both getting wireless off the same router.

So maybe, just maybe someone knows some easy fix to make my internet go faster or how to make youtube load the whole videos?

Additional info: I have Webroot and Malwarebytes and they both run clean scans so I'm pretty sure its not spyware slowing it down.

Edit: I'm on a Toshiba Satellite A305 laptop and am running Windows Vista if that helps anything

Thanks so much in advance for your help! 




 And I don't mean the historical explanation. I mean the "hey that actually makes sense" explanation. Seriously, our 12 hour blocks go from 12,1,2...11 It just makes no sense to me. Like maybe if it went from 12,11,10,9...1 then ok I get it, it's going backwards, but this go 11 numbers back then start increasing by 1 thing makes no sense to me.

And no I'm not high, I just finished my college semester and have 3 weeks to sit around before Summer classes start so I've been contemplating a lot of boring things.
