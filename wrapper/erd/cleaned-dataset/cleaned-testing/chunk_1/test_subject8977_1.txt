 Its a good lesson for all our boys. Take it in stride and be humble...that's the attitude that got us our Smythe! 




 They hate us because we are a top house at our school. It's pretty funny. 




 We got a lot of positive feedback, even from our rival chapter! We still get the hate but, hell, with enough Yaks you might see a second video. 




 The reaction has been incredibly positive by all sorority women as well as our rival fraternity on campus! It's a good idea, just make sure it's executed well!

 No more farts!
