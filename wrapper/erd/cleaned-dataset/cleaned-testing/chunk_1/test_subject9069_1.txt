Since Poe is mentioned in it, I thought I'd add that I'd recently learned [Poe and Longfellow](http://books.google.com/books?id=4W1v0KXuEjYC pg=PA84 lpg=PA84 dq=poe+on+longfellow+plagiarism source=bl ots=a5cQH7b4YY sig=S6fRB4pGESmLK51qnBNlO_uhO5g hl=en sa=X ei=jYH2U7mQEIaeyATI4YL4Cg ved=0CC8Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage q=poe%20on%20longfellow%20plagiarism f=false) had a rivalry where they called each other plagiarists.

 A criticism I've seen lately of Philip K. Dick is that he had original premises and concepts but that his execution usually feel short of his ambitions. While obviously that's mostly a matter of opinion, it made me curious who serves the opposite function. Who's a writer who took cliche ideas and characters but had prose that made up for it?  














 Mostly that scene where they don't know if trolls can smell the blood of a Muslim.

 Related, kinda: an actor performing the part of Dr.   Jekyll/Mr. Hyde on stage in 1888 was questioned by the police under the suspicion he might be Jack the Ripper because they thought his performance was too good for him to not just be a dangerously insane man.

 Sure, but he deserted the cause.  




 I guess it made him paranoid that someone's trying to make people walruses and made this film as a warning.  




 Is this the cover for that book?  




 Two weeks. I was camping, I hated everyone there and my body. I didn't even change my pants for one week. I don't know how well the fact I was a twelve year-old boy scout works as an excuse.  









 In your surgery experience, have you had any truly horrible experiences of the types we have a few well-known examples of on Reddit?  




 Oh yeah, there's an interview where a guy with the channel King of Random testifies to that: http://humor.gunaxin.com/king-of-random-grant-thompson/175117

 My point was that there was nothing interesting about the character as written.  




 It kinda looks like a couple tuna melts. I take it that's some version of cottage cheese?  




 If he feels the need to share a picture of it and contextualize it in such a way, I don't know how it could more obviously be narcissism. 

That said, DAMN that looks like a good steak.  




 We must make this joke over and over to compensate for how we overpay for shitty food to feel superior to plebs!

 I don't see what made Wendy Torrance as written for that movie a good character. She's hardly compelling on her own and I don't know what Duvall could have done to save it.   




 Coloration is a bit different between the two. Leave it to CNN to not white balance properly!  














 Wow, that was great! 




 A guy runs a red light. His passenger tells him not to do that, but the driver says "It's okay, my brother drives like this!" He runs another red light. His passenger tries to insist, the driver says again "I told ya, it's okay, my brother drives like this!" Then he comes up to a green light and stops. His passenger asks what he's doing now and the driver says "Well, my brother might be coming the other way!"

 I consider him even worse than that Fred channel from a few years ago, but every MLP Facebook group seems like it will have a post a day claiming his channel is great or some such. 

The overlap is incomprehensible. I'm sure someone will claim it's like being a fan of this show, but it's really not. It would be like if Pinkie Pie squealed incoherently for nine minutes out of every episode and the camerawork was swooshy and swirly and practically meant to be headache inducing. 

Edit: Judging by the feedback, it's not a Brony thing but a Facebook thing. Cool. Thanks for your time!

 There was a copy of one of the Swamp Thing comic books at my library. In it there's a page showing the many ways an evil force's power is supposed to be infecting and corrupting the world. One of the images in it was a couple little girls putting their kitten in the microwave and being just about to start it. 

Someone had taken a pen and just scribbled out that panel, but you could still see what was happening. It was the only panel they had done that for even though others featured people and other animals being murdered. I was bewildered that apparently someone out there was the kind of person who would react that way to the though of a kitten being killed but would still read overtly horrific comic books and get that far into it. 

I've also seen a few Stephen King books with pentagrams drawn in them, but that just seemed like kids messing around.

 I have to admit I'm more curious about how photo booths like this worked in the 1900s. Did you take the film out yourself and get it developed? Was there a full time photographer on hand? Would he or she have gotten in trouble for taking the picture?  




 Is there biblical precedent for that?

He takes the fly out, shakes it over his beer and yells "Spit it out, ya little blighter! Spit it out!"

 Last night I went on a walk through the local park. At one point there was a  clearing with a fawn on it. It sprinted away as I approached by the path took a turn so I started to walk away and it stopped when it became obvious I wasn't approach it. Then it started to gallop after me. I thought this was kind of weird so I just sort of yelled "Hey!" when it was only like two feet from me and it stopped. I looked past it and saw that its mother had showed up and was eyeing me. After staring at me walking away a few more seconds, and turned and galloped in another random direction. 

I certainly knew better than to touch a wild deer, but is it likely that fawn was going to do anything to me if I hadn't yelled something? Like, I don't know, bump into me or bite me or some territorial "playful" thing?

 I was going to make a fairly crude MLP game with 2d sprite graphics (hired out, I'm well aware of my limitations as an artist and a bit overpaid.) Which of these stories sounds like a more interesting game: 

A. Twilight and the others of the Mane Six experiment with a spell Twilight Sparkle found in the archives to make them "more their cutie marks." Instead of making them better at those things, they end up literally turning into those things (Applejack becomes a pony made of apple, Rarity becomes a crystal statue, etc.) Fortunately Twilight had a book of cures on hand if something went wrong. 

So the games are really minigames where you try to cure the ponies of their different states, with different levels of difficulty and different reactions from the ponies (i.e. Rainbow Dash could think it's awesome that she's a pony made of rainbow-colored lightning with a mane and tail of cloud and would try to avoid being cured.)  

B. The Princesses decide to let the changelings into Equestria under close supervision to bring about peace between the two cultures. The idea seems to be going as well as could be expected at first (like a few changelings can't help but try to pass themselves off as ponies, but they get rooted out quickly.) Then Queen Chrysalis of all ponies reports that there seems to be an epidemic of it happening that she can't control. It's up to the player to get to the bottom of whether the changelings are really innocent, under something else's control, if it can be made to work, etc. 

I'm loosely planning that it would be a matter of trivia games to sort out who's real and not and a point-and-click beyond that.

I know he was just a speechwriter for Nixon, but I thought possibly he would have been in a position to know something we don't about the situation. Or he was wildly nostalgic and expressing some hero worship. 

What's your opinion?

 



















 I have a novel with a pitch I have streamlined for easy submission, but I'm fairly new to professional writing and all my previous experience is nonfiction. Since the reality of the situation is that I'm selling myself along with the book pitch, is it better to show I have a following by having some short story publication credits or to show I have plenty of Facebook followers, Twitter followers, and so on?  












































 I developed a bad habit in middle school where if someone was busty and had a lot of cleavage on display, I would look off in some other direction or at some arbitrary other thing because otherwise I might stare. This might be a fairly rare reaction I have because I grew up often not looking at people's face when we were talking and neither did my brother, but if it's common, which is more annoying?   




 I had never hallucinated in my life before this. Ive rarely gone a night without sleep, Ive never had a recreational drug stronger than a cappuccino. Im not ill in anyway that Im aware of. The most severely Ive ever been medicated is when I got prescribed zoloft my freshman year at Pescadero High for about two weeks for mild obsessive compulsive disorder. Believe me, Ive gotten a second and third opinion from psychiatrists and neurologists and theres nothing wrong me. Nothing they can find, anyway. 

It was a night three weeks ago. The moon was full enough that places without any street or house lights were dark blue instead of pitch black except for in the shadows when I biked to Moms. I always biked to her place because it helped reinforce the impression that I was trying to get in shape. 

The layout between my Mothers place and my apartment is like this: her place, then down main street for a bit, then turn left into the dog park, up the big hill in the dog park, into the apartment complexes, through the smaller park, theres the post office, go along the beach path for a few hundred meters, then Im home.  

Everything was unusually pleasant as I started riding from the home and down main street. I remember that I checked for my cell phone only to find it wasnt there. I recalled then that Id left it to recharge in my kitchen then and felt dumb for not taking it with me to recharge at Moms.  

When I reached the dog park, I made my usual try at surmounting the hill, but as I said, Im not in shape and about a third of the way up I switched to walking the bicycle up its main trail on my route. That trail is surrounded by thick undergrowth and really pretty underlit, with just a single lamppost lighting it. Out of nowhere I heard growling in the undergrowth. I barely had time to look back and to my left to see a dog come sprinting onto the path. It was a German Sheperd breed and the most furious animal Ive ever seen. Its ears were flat and its fangs were bared and dripping, as if it was attacking out of hunger instead of just anger. It was on me in a second.   

I was extremely lucky and apparently the dog was extremely stupid. When it leapt up at me, it got caught on the bike that I had been walking. Its jaw snapped close enough to me that a gob of its saliva landed on my shirt but it didn't injure me. I was just barely able to keep the bike upright so it stayed. Before it had a chance to back up and try for me again, I heard someone yelling "No!" in a scolding tone. A huge guy, at least a foot taller than me, grabbed the dog by the collar and pulled it away. He still seemed to struggle for a few seconds but then the dog sat and just growled and snarled at me. 

As I processed what had just happened and then got a hold of myself, I saw that the man that had just gotten the dog under control was just staring at me. No look of worry that his dog had just attacked someone, no apologies, nothing but a blank stare at me as his dog growled between his legs. I waited a moment for him to say something or at least move. 

Control your goddam dog! I told him just to break the silence. He didnt respond, although his dog barked stood again and tried to charge at me, but the owner held it strong. I climbed back on the bike and strained my way up the hill, not wanting to look too weak to pedal the bike in front of the guy Id just yelled at. 

After something like that, I was on the lookout for stuff as I pedaled out of the dog park and into the apartment complexes. There was no one out walking but plenty of cars and trucks driving by. Everything felt normal, pleasant even, but of course I was still a bit shaken. I think I felt lucky for a few seconds there that I hadnt pissed my pants when the dog attacked.

As I pedalled past the first apartment building in the complex, I saw the first person Id seen just out walking that evening. It was a woman of roughly thirty with very deeply tanned skin and wearing one of those Islamic headscarves. Her eyes were very, very wide and her movements were unnaturally stiff. She looked at me as I approached her as if she thought I might be about to attack. 

Feeling both still a little paranoid but emasculated I stopped and dismounted. 

Maam, are you alright? I asked, thoughtlessly walking up to her, probably exactly wrong for approaching a scared person. 

Oh, yes yes! she insisted with a rapid nods while backing away from me, making a big phony smile. 

Are you sure? I said dully. 

Yeah. Im fine. Thank you for asking. As she said that, she began to walk forward again, giving me a wide berth. When she passed me she turned her head round to look at me, her smile gone and her eyes still wide. When she did, her eyes... they seemed to elongate across her face. Her left eye seemed to curve up and around her temple and her right extended down and around her cheek, both the whites of her eyes and the pupils and irises with them. I would have just thought I was misinterpreting what I was seeing, but when the left eye elongated up to her head scarf, it went under it instead of being superimposed over it as I would have thought in a hallucination, She paused as this happened, letting me have a good long look at what I thought I was seeing. Much longer than I would have wanted. Then she turned and continued her awkward walk, looking normal from the back. 

I didnt know what to do for a moment. Should I just run up and try to see her eyes again? As I said earlier, Id never hallucinated before. I felt lucid if extremely uneasy then. I decided to just keep going on my errand and then go home. I guess I wanted to continue thinking that it was an anomaly with my vision and that everything was normal. 

I started biking past the apartments. Despite my apparent desire to continue as if things were normal, I was looking all around me for something else out of the ordinary. This unfortunately caused me to look in some of the apartment windows. Most of them had their blinds or their curtains shut, but every once in awhile there was one I could see inside. As unpleasant as it might sound, I looked into each one I could as I rode by. 

I went by several open windows with nothing out of the ordinary happening in them, but something I think I saw in one window made me slow down. It was hard to describe, but I thought I saw two people that seemed to be standing back to back for some reason. But when I stopped and went back a little, I saw that the two were doing what looked like a regular dance of some kind, probably practice for some show. I dont know. I got going again, feeling like I was letting my wil imagination convince me to do some skeevy things. I tried to stop myself from looking into the next open window to give the whoever might be in there privacy. What I saw instead made me squeeze my brakes with a death grip. 

There was an old, heavy man sitting on a couch. I remember he was wearing a white undershirt. Other than that, all I had time to see was what he was doing: He was cutting his face with what looked from the way he was holding it like an exacto-blade. He would push it against his cheek, chin, nose, forehead, twitch his hand and leave a cut, then slowly move the knife to another part of his face for another cut. He was looking off to his left with a contented expression while he did this like someone watching television without any particular interest. 

I watched him do this for what felt like minutes on end but was probably less than half a minute. I remember twitching a couple times looking at this from how painful it looked. I have no recollection of having ever seen anything like that before. I was becoming sick to my stomach at the sight of his cuts and the blood dripping down his face and staining his undershirt. And I tried, but I couldnt convince myself I was hallucinating. 

Out of nowhere, he turned and looked at me. He glared and made to get up, his blade still in his hand. I imagined he had to be getting up to come after me. I must have unconsciously lowered my feet to the ground, but I tried to lift my feet to the pedals. In my desperation to get out of there, I missed the pedals. I looked down, this time, and got a trembling left foot on the pedal. I looked back at the window to see if he was coming for me. 

There was no sign of him. I hesitated for a second then. He might have been behind the door, about to get outside only a few steps from me. But I decided then that even if I was seeing things, I would need to call the police when I got home. Even if I was seeing something, there was a possibility there was in a man in that apartment that was on...I dont know. PCP, maybe. Or at least was a chance I was watching disturbed man hurt himself. So I looked quickly for the apartment number, which was 204, and then biked away. I didnt hear the sound of any doors opening or any feet pounding for awhile, so by around the time I got out of the apartment complex I felt safer. 

That feeling did not last. There was nothing down Main Street that was out of the ordinary, so I think I slightly convinced myself Id just been seeing things again. Not enough that I didnt start to work through in my head what I would say to the police when I called. But when I reached the small park that would lead to the post office before the beach trail that went home, it happened. 

I heard the rapid tapping sound of footsteps behind me. I looked behind me. Empty street, but I definitely could hear that sound. Then I heard a growling and snarling noise. I didnt see it, but I thought for sure that it was that same dog from the hill. Itd broken free from its strange owner and had tracked me down and was coming after me, still not visible even in the light of the full moon. 

I started pedalling as fast as I could. The Veterans Park didnt have any hills like the earlier one, but that dog still seemed to be gaining on me. It was barking and snarling like it had lost its mind as it seemed to be going faster than me even as I put my back into it. I stood up on the pedals but the sound of snarls and growls just seemed to get louder. 

I looked back behind me, and there was still no dog to be seen. It was only feet behind me now from the sound and getting louder. I remember for some reason why, after seeing those strange things earlier today, am I only hearing this goddamned dog? Still looking behind me I heard the sound of what seemed to be a dog jumping forward and the growling coming right at my face.

I dont know if my bike hit something or what happened exactly, but I found myself falling over and hitting the ground hard, my ears full of the sound of a dog attacking me. The snarls and growls made become so loud now that they hurt to hear. They were accompanied now by the sound of skin-tearing and gnawing, as if the dog somehow had my entire head inside its jaws, like it was killing me. I could open my eyes and see there was no dog, I could feel my cheeks and know there were no teeth sunk into them, that certainly the dogs jaws wouldnt fit over my head. But I still thrashed around and screamed on the ground and held my ears as tightly as I could from how painfully loud it was. I dont know how long I heard that dog attacking me, but I remember how it stopped perfectly. Instead of just stopping like youd imagine a hallucination to, I heard the sound of a dogs paws as it backed away. panted and lipped its lips, then sprinted away. 

I felt around my head again, checking once more for blood. I wasnt injured, of course, save a bruise on my leg and elbow. But I checked it again before I tried to get my leg out from under the bike and sit up. It was dead quiet for awhile as I caught my breath and tried to get my nerves back under control. When I finally climbed back on my bike, I was trembling so hard that I immediately almost lost my balance. But slowly, awkwardly I got out of the park and continued pedaling home. Naturally I completely forgot to drop off the dvd at the post office. 

I was on the beach path that leads to my apartment. It was still really bright for the dead of night. I mention that because theres sort of a beach of rocks about the size of office chairs that goes on for hundreds of yards between my apartment and the post office, and it was bright enough that I could see all the individual rocks. And I could really well make out what was in the rocks. 

It was a little girl, like not a toddler but not quite at adolescence, that looked like she was in a floral print dress. She seemed to be just sort of climbing from rock to rock and her hands and feet. I was afraid and not sure what I was seeing anymore, or i probably would have called to her and asked who let her play in a hazardous place at an hour like this. As it was I was I didnt even want to look at her. I told myself she probably was taught not to talk to strangers or that she wasnt real to justify not so much as talking to her. When I glanced over and saw that she was waving at me, I turned away quickly.

HI! she yelled at me in that kind of insincere but chipper way kids do. I didnt acknowledge her. I was looking forward at my apartment. It was a deep bluish gray in the moonlight and it had never looked so much like home. 

I heard her scream. It was not the sound of a kid yelling out of excitement or just for attention. It was a sound that was choked at the end. Something cut her breathing off violently and awkwardly. But I knew with the disturbed way my imagination was going at the time that I did not want to look over at what I was imagining was happening.

Helpfff! she screamed, something obviously muffling her ability speak. I wasnt 	going to look. I heard something like a hideous collision against rock, a sound with a crunch like something was being broken and skin was being torn. I kept my eyes on home. My imagination wasnt going to hit me with some vision. Then I heard the voice sound as if she were lifting high into the air as she continued her muffled begging for help. I guess it seemed to me that such a thing couldnt look real, that it would probably look ridiculous. Whatever it was, my curiosity compelled me to look up where the sound was coming from. 

What I saw was a puff of blackness against a cloud brightly lit by the moon. The blackness quickly dissipated as the scream abruptly ended. I was faintly aware of two objects falling to the rocks below. I couldnt make out what they were at all, but I had a feeling they were the worst part of all that had happened so far. That of all the things that Id looked at that night, those would two fallen objects were what I would most regret seeing. 

When I got home, I called the police immediately about the man in the apartment, assuming it was the thing that would be most likely to be believed. When they asked me if there was anything else they should know, I bit my lip and admitted that I had seen a little unsupervised little girl on the rocks near my apartment. That was all I felt there was to tell. I didnt sleep that night but I forced myself to stay in bed with my eyes shut, not wanting to see if my imagination had something else in mind. 

The next day, the police called. They wanted me to come in for questioning. What I learned down at the station was that there was nothing suspicious reported in Room 204, there was something of interest found on the beach. A girls clothes matching the floral print I had described were found along with socks, a shoe. A few questions later, they mentioned that they also found blood with bits of skin in it. I wasnt about to mention the things I heard and the small but unbelievable thing I saw, and I think I could tell from their body language that the police didnt believe me but they hadnt found any evidence that implicated me. So now Im under suspicion for the things I saw and the things I reported. But thats far from the worst part. 

When I started this, I mentioned that I had never hallucinated before that night. Well, now I do, and I know I am. Ive seen my eyes twist around my face in the mirror but felt my face and realized its normal. Ive heard that dog growling around and chewing my head when Ive tried to sleep. Ive seen that girl again, though from a distance every time since I dont know what she looked like. I see the man with his face still bleeding through apartment windows. I had gaps between seeing and hearing them that were long enough in the first two weeks that I occasionally had hopes the sight and sound of them was gone, but in the third week its become constant enough that I know thats not going away on its own. 

So thats why Im posting this online. If you know anything about any of this, who that person in that apartment might have been, who that girl was, any of this, let me know. I havent slept in days and I havent had much peace. What the truth is seems less and less important as time goes on. I just, I need to know why I saw what I saw during that night ride.
