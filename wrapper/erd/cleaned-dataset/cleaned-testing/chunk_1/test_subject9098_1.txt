 We just have the anatomy of raptors in our heads from what we suspected them to look like millions of years ago.  Over that time I'm sure they have been able to evolve enough to put their long claws up to their mouths in order to think. 




 Like a whole bag of dicks! 




 And after too many uses you had to find just the right sweet spot on the switch to make the RCA input work through it. 




 That's because it's still the best multiplayer system to date! 




 I usually try to use a self checkout anymore so i can cram as much into as few bags as possible.  But you're saying that by putting my items together like this when going to a person would avoid the bagger person from using 13 bags for 15 items? 




 Oddly I agree with you here.  When I was in college and used a computer lab, cleaning the roller was one of the things I usually did. 




 The Big Lebowski is a good one to do this to considering how many times you have to watch it to get everything. 




 I don't think the success kid would hit the wrong link in the first place. 




 Goddammit!!  I lost! 




 Heck, everyone knows you can drive 5 mph above the speed limit and still not get pulled over. 




 I absolutely hate it when someone stands there and holds the door when you're 50 feet away yet.  It makes you feel like you should go faster since they are holding the door, but at the same time it pisses you off because you can't walk at your normal lazy pace! 




 You'll read anything on the cue cards.  And I mean anything! 




 If we were living 100 years in the past, then we wouldn't be able to read shit like this on the internet! 




 I'd say it's worth the risk of jail if it's already been censored for everyone. 




 So is the guy on the left his translator then? (I'm aware it's not Jackie Chan, so that answer is not necessary) 




 It definitely beats drinking at the bar the entire night.  Especially when you're going to be with the same group of people regardless where you drink. 




 I wonder how many facebook friends God has? 




 Bi-force? 




 You are very strong willed if you can wait until Christmas for all 3 of those games! 




 Is the guy in the bottom left supposed to be Canadian? 




 Team America!  Fuck Yeah!! 




 That would be fun to randonly run up to a mime like that and act like you ran into something.  Probably would catch him a bit off guard. 




 It looks like a shoe according to Family Guy. 









 I hear ebay calling for this little gem! 




 This is so true!  And then you don't even have to clean the dishes when you're finished! 




 I think concept 2 looks the best. 




 Wait, Gamestop was allowed to sell another game aside from MW3 during the launch? 




 Better learn some Austin Powers driving moves in order to get out of that situation! 




 And once one light goes out, they ALL go out!! 




 When my parents buit their house (in 1992) the entryway closet is where he put the switch for the outside outlets.  Although, they still take the lights down each year. 




 Yes, I'd say I agree that the method "works" better when working on inanimate objects. 




 He must not be very big.  Her mouth isn't open very wide. 




 So cussing up a storm to try to get something fixed doesn't work?  I never would have thought that. 




 Totally agree with this.  I've given up on even thinking that I'll actually do something in the morning before work. 




 With the lighting it sorta makes it look like a cult waiting for the time of ascension. 




 So the princess is in another castle then? 




 Some day I will have my own DK Arcade machine! 




 I'd say definitely good job for a last minute costume! 




 I like how the Rep says they have a rule saying they do not do refunds on downloaded games.  Then immediately following that statement says they will refund you with credit and remove the downloaded game from your account. 




 But it's always better on the original system compared to a ROM! 




 But it's worth it when you kill someone in a shooting battle with your last bullet that you just loaded into the gun! 




 Sorry, I meant it was after the system first launched, as in the first 6 months to a year.  Not just the actual launch titles on the first day.  Later in its life the prices decreased overall though. 




 I recall most 3rd party games being $70 when the system launched and 1st party games being $60.  May have been a few that I saw that were $80 though.  And later in the systems life these went down to $60 and $50 for the most part. 




 Good costumes.  Although you're missing the best driver....Donkey Kong! 




 Couldn't they have at least made the game a color version? 




 Hmm, so that explains why people have to wait so long to get actual assistance for Battlefield 3 problems. 




 It must come with free controller converter cables that aren't visible in the picture. 




 Oh, I see what you did there! 




 Same here.  Someone wanted me to join so i did just to check it out.  What am I supposed to do, write the same exact stuff that I put on facebook for the same people to read? 




 Looks like they just wanted to use you as a test dummy to see what would happen beyond the corner. 




 I can't stand it when people do that either, even when they aren't my games.  I'm glad I trained my younger brothers years ago that games need to be put back in cases and regardless how mad you get, you shouldn't throw a controller on the ground.  Or else you may face a week of not being able to play.  Now a days the game collection is in great shape and everything still works like new! 




 Is your wife's name Sheryl by any chance? 




 Holy balls, that is sweet! 




 Looks pretty interesting.  A slightly different take on a game that actually might require some thinking. 




 That is 2 1/2 minutes of my life gone.  But I'd say it was worth it. 




 More like a double crime since you technically took 2 great games down! 




 When he said 64, he may have been referring to a Commodore 64.  Either way....fail! 




 Must be a pretty exciting game if they don't even want to use the chairs right behind them! 




 Hmm, I must say that after almost 2 decades of playing the game I never noticed a difference in speed with the coins.  Of course I always use DK Jr when I play, which would be a faster top speed than most of the others to begin with.  I might have to do some testing to see if there is a noticable difference with coins now. 




 Sorry, only TWO people can have the same joke.  You're the third unfortunately. 




 That seems like the most logical way to go about this. 




 You just made me lose The Game!

 You got me.  I guess you get your free punch on my arm. 




 Don't forget to wash your hands!  You wouldn't want those shit particles accidentally being posted onto reddit! 




 On the older versions of the game the blue shell goes after the person in first at the time it's fired.  On the Wii version it changes targets to who is in first when it gets up to the front of everyone. 




 I don't think the coins made you go faster if you had more.  The point of the coins was so when you got hit by another kart you didn't spin out.  Each hit would make you lose a coin and when you were out and got hit by another kart you would spin out.
