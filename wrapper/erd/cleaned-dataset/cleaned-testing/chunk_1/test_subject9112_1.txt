 I know about research on field-effect transistor, electrochemical, enzymatic and microbial sensors, but never heard about anything cheap, convenient and sufficiently reusable. Not that it can not be done, of course.  




 I like the design. There are other more interesting things to measure besides radiation. Say, lactose or gluten for those who are sensitive.
