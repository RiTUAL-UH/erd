 Anal sex with a virgin girl and a guy with an above-average penis size cannot end well.  




 Do you have a source for the size of Philadelphia? Surely there were larger Indian or Chinese cities.  




 But surely the people causing the conditions leading to the Serbians feeling the need to revolt were at fault? 




 Aren't all wars a competition of imperial powers masquerading as good vs evil? 




 I think you're a) onto a winner of a girl and b) going to need to take it slow. She's been hurt badly before, wants to trust you, but can't - YET. Also, I know from personal experience that depression will only magnify this, and she will perceive all of these problems as being her fault. All you can do is not pressure her but continue to be loving and caring, and she will do the rest in time. 

To use a convenient metaphor from your own story, you need to slowly lead her into the water and carefully help her relearn to swim, despite her fear and apprehension.  




 I'm pretty sure you do share that opinion with everyone.  




 I hate to break it to you, bro, but that kind of attitude is exactly what women (or anyone) finds LEAST attractive. Comparatively, no one gives a fuck if you're ugly/hot smart/dumb so on and so forth, and they'll put up with a bit of self depreciation and lack of self esteem, but when you've let it turn into (what comes across as) bitterness and anger at everything around you that you perceive as better than you, NO ONE will want to spend time with you in any capacity. You have to force yourself to believe in yourself - not even that you're the best or the most outstanding at something, but at least that you're AS GOOD AS EVERYBODY ELSE.

For example, you mentioned that there's a chick who swam across Lake Ontario. So you're not capable of doing that. Well, neither am I. Neither are 6.9 BILLION of the other people in the world. Neither is the guy above me who is a QUALIFIED OLYMPIC SWIMMER. But I can guarantee you're better at swimming across that lake than 1 billion (yes, one billion) people in the world. Chances are you're still better than 3 billion people.

The other thing you need to remind yourself is that depression and low self-esteem is the easy way out. By telling yourself that you suck and that you can't even try, you ARE worse than everybody else at the one thing we all compete in - LIFE. Life itself. It's a race to the finish line, and you're walking dejectedly in the opposite direction. By turning that around and bring determined to win life, you are instantly superior to everybody in the skill that matters more than anything. 

And it'll make you sexy. 

Source: low self esteem, clinical depression, and discovering the hard way that - despite how hard my friends try, and despite anything that anyone ever does - the only person who will get change any of that is ME. 

EDIT: And dude, linking me to an entire thread of people who have completely changed their lives with a bit of exercise and fashion sense, and telling me you're still ugly, is like beating me around the face with the solutions to all of your problems while saying a solution doesn't exist. Seriously. Just go read what you just freaking showed me.  




 Props for putting the TL;DR at the top. I can't understand why one would have to read everything else before finding it.  




 Sounds like the witch hunt seen in Monty Python/Holy Grail.  




 The fact that he had to withdraw a further $300 to cover his actions probably didn't help this.  




 To be fair, the same goes for women not being men without penises. 




 TIL there's a Taken 2 




 This is the appropriate response to a good 50% of /r/datingadvice.  




 Go find a girl, any girl, preferably a hot one. Look at her. Realise the fact that she - it - is nothing but a squishy bag of water and organs. This bag of meat moves around and noises come out of its mouth. Random impulses of electricity cause this to happen. This object is nothing more, and nothing less, than a sack of fluids and bones. 

Look at anyone like that for even a moment and they will never intimidate you again.  




 It sounds like you're doing pretty well, and that you just needed to egg it out and have some people reassure you (and there's nothing wrong with that).

Stay strong! 




 Exactly my point.  




 This is one of those things that you really want to read, but really really shouldn't, because it sends you right back to square one.

And so we come to love the damage we do to ourselves with the absence of that other person, cling to it as much as we clung to them, and use loneliness itself to get through the day.

Thank god I deleted her phone number, because I don't think I'd be able to restrain myself at the moment otherwise.

EDIT: Also, if you're a deviantart person, I highly suggest you submit this. It was beautiful. 




 Classical music is hardly music for the masses either. 




 At my uni's music program I find it completely the opposite - classical musicians are superior, and god help you if you're playing Jazz Bazz. Snobbery everywhere.

Of course, I'm just a lowly Musical Theatre actor (incidentally by far the most competitive course to get into) so I get it from all sides. 




 I like to say "tell me the most awesome thing about yourself." Shows I'm interested in her, usually reveals something they're passionate about, and boosts their self esteem by allowing them to brag for a second. Also, if they come out with something shallow or stupid without thinking about their answer at all, it shows that they probably have very little maturity or self-introspection, and I know that they wouldn't be well suited to me. 




 Tbh it sounds like there's a problem with her, not you, that she doesn't want to tell you. Especially if she contacted you later to make you not feel bad - if you'd pissed her off she wouldn't give a fuck.

Has she broken up with anyone recently, and can't relate to a new guy yet? A self esteem issue where she feels like she doesn't deserve you? (Unlikely I know, but I've seen a girl with depression remain convinced that no one could ever love her even after being asked out by a guy) 




 Too put it nicely, /r/seduction (not /r/seddit, which is the same with just 300 subs) is... geared towards sex and nothing else. It also encourages people to look at the opposite sex as an opportunity and target of manipulation, not a person with emotions.

In short, it's not for everybody. 




 As fun as these threads are to read, they're all essentially pointless - you could wear a little pink tutu and still be sexy if you're attractive, and if you're not, even a $40 000 suit won't save you.

Rule 1: Be attractive. Rule 2: Don't be unattractive. 




 Girls don't emotionally mature faster. They're just as fucking stupid at 17, they just don't display it in the 'let's do stuff that might get us killed' way. 




 Majority of SOCIAL risks. Girls do have pregnancy. But I agree with you. 




 If it gets buried then no one is going to see or read it anyway. So why point it out? 




 Firstly, I suggest you xpost to /r/singing. They get these kind of requests on a daily basis.

Also, your audition song doesn't have to be about the same thing as the show - especially with a character this specific. If it's a funny show, go a character song. If it's more serious, likewise.

For your range (which I suggest you edit into the original post, along with your age), I suggest [I'm Not That Smart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M93eivYXr4) from The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee  as a lighthearted character song, and [Valjean's Soliloquy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GrJeP9FKN0) as a more serious alternative. 




 He's saying your penis is 5'3". 




 Surely if she's mentally unstable, something would have happened like this before? That's a long time! 




 It ripped the arms off a droid? What a woman. 




 Dammit Jesus, you fuck everything up. 




 /r/depression. They are friendly people going through the same thing as you, and I find they can help a lot. 




 When you need to make a decision with a group, and everyone's doing the 'I don't mind, you pick' thing (such as where shall we get dinner etc.), don't be all considerate and ask them what they want to do. Make a decision right there and then, and stick to it. Major confidence points. 




 I hope the pizza man delivered.  




 That's absolutely awful. I'm sorry you had to go through that. If you ever need someone to talk to, please PM me. 




 I think overall he means the same as you - to own yourself, everything about you, and any situation you might be in.  




 So basically - be attractive and confident, and don't complain when a girl who you have displayed neither to isn't interested, just because you're 'nice'? 




 The teacher too has acted inappropriately and unprofessionally. Is there a higher authority you can go to? 




 That's completely out of line. You should have told him to fuck off in no uncertain terms. It's sexual assault, ANYONE would be uncomfortable with that.  




 Well, this is r/sex. 




 Fascist clues?! 




 Musos can be very huggy. You might want to be careful there.  




 Swimsuit? Where are you waking up, in a creek? 




 Similar situation and similar end result, except I only realized the change in myself a few days ago. Great relationship with an amazing and unique person, brutal breakup, depression and the ability to talk to any girl because what the hell, they're not HER, they will never be as good as her.

Finally get over her - now I have the confidence and communication skills without the baggage. 




 Presumably somewhere where people don't talk to them much. 




 Exactly.  




 As someone who is in their first year of college, and had exactly the same situation as you in high school - IT GETS SO MUCH FUCKING BETTER. 




 This is going to sound terribly specific, but I suggest you try to get into some Music/Performing Arts circles. All of my best friends are musicians, and (with obvious exceptions) they are the kindest, most generous, most fun and by far the most outgoing people you will ever meet. They make friends very quickly and easily, and never have too many, so you'll be welcomed into a group within minutes.

While these types of people obviously are not perfect (can be very egotistical, competitive, and bitchy if you get on their bad side, eccentric as hell), they seem to me to be the best option for getting out of the situation you're in quickly. Giving up on my more conventional 'friends' and increasing my socializing with these guys single-handedly solved my loneliness, found all of my best friends and my first (  subsequent) girlfriend(s), and gave me plenty of things to get out and do/see.

So maybe join a local community choir or theatre company. Join a band/orchestra if you can play an instrument. Trust me, good times will be had. 




 So why comment? 




 When you've told him subtly you don't want him arond, and he asks why, you need to tell him EXACTLY why. Meaning he's being creepy and overly attached.

It's part of the 'nice guy' phenonemon - there's a great thread about it over [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/lncn2/compiled_a_kill_nice_guy_with_fire_guide_for_men/) - wherein he just does not understand all of the social signals you have sent him to say back off. You have no other option but to tell him in no uncertain terms he's not wanted. He be a bit unhappy, but he will learn from the experience and do much better with interpersonal interactions in the future.

If you aren't brutally honest about what he's doing wrong, he'll be one of the sorry creatures that rants about how they are in the 'friendzone' and 'she keeps going out with guys who aren't as nice and dedicated as I am,' etc etc. You can save him the long term agony now with one frank conversation. 




 The fact that you're being so aggressive in return, when she has clearly stated she was just trying to be helpful, is far worse. 




 I think the only place they don't have them is above the tree line on our biggest mountains in snow season. Even then, I'd take precautions. 




 Brisbane and 18 here, I assume you guys have Coffee Club? Fairly classy, waited tables, decent food, but still pretty chilled. Usually in central locations. I take people there all the time. 




 Can I suggest you crosspost this to /r/relationship_advice or something similar? You hardly need help seducing her, which is what this subreddit is really for. Also, edit out most of the sex, they won't be interested unless it's r/gonewildstories.

As far as suggestions, I'd say that 7 months is plenty of time to have a lot of fun. Tell her you want to be casual, that she can take her time and make up her own mind about whether she trusts you once she knows you better. Don't push her, just enjoy her company. 




 So give everyone money? 




 Add this to "I don't think I'm ever going to find someone better" 




 Hopefully they'll have kids. Then there will be. 




 To be fair, though, clothes are designed to accent the body of the person wearing them. They don't do the seducing all by themselves. 




 So do guys.  




 If only we ever got off reddit and went outside... 




 It was probably diagnosed and/or medicated. 




 Because of the twist ending I didn't realise he didn't actually write that for a while. 




 Lawyered 




 I'm expecting a full Harvard bibliographical reference directly under the tattoo. 




 Gonna rock some Jane Austen/Anna Karenina. 




 The irony is that you need more full stops because you have too many. 




 A common theme seems to be books - what kind of books? I have shitloads and there's no way I can get them all in my room at once.
