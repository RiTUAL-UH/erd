 Can someone explain what he did? I feel like what he is saying is that the illegals that cross the border are bad people. Is it wrong to say because most of them aren't? Is there a border problem where drugs and gangs from Mexico are bringing crime to the U.S.? Is it dangerous for Americans living there now? He didn't call all Mexicans rapists like people want to claim. Did he cross a boundary by even bringing it up when it's not a problem at all? Where can I find this info?
