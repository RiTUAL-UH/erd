 Best bit of advice my parents have ever taught me was to "just ask", the worst they can say is "no" (I know thats not the worst but that was the general principle) 
I've had this attitude since and its handy, its given me the confidence to approach new employers.. girlfriends.. 




 Confidence to follow through with my plans. 




 try "I'm really confused by this assignment, how about you?" or "Hi, can I borrow a pen? I'm useless at being prepared...." or something along them lines. Then follow it up with "How long have you been in this class for? I've never seen you before?"   




 Oh yeh, like during the olympics
