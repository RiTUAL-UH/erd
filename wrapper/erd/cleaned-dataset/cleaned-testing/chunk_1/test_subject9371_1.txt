 My vitals are good, no one's freaking out about how thin I am and forcing me in heavy clothing anymore..yet I'm still expected to gain *more*.

I know a BMI of 15 isn't healthy, but any further up, not being able to feel certain bones I'm likely to become depressed and maybe throw myself off a bridge. Don't worry, that's not a real suicide threat, I'm too wimpy and don't know any bridges.

I don't even get to be one of those Instagrammers who get motivation from other recoverers due to circumstances. *I. Have. Nothing.*

I wish this would've never happened, I wish I was still me instead of a beast that wants to destroy every bit of himself.
