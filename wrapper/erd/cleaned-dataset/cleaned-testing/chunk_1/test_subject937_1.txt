 Accountants know which businesses are thriving and managed the best: which painter, roofer, plumber, electrician, dentist, etc. 














 Dear [test_subject937],

Thank you for contacting me about net neutrality.

I oppose any form of censorship or discrimination. I believe those who pay for our web capacity must be able to recover their costs, or it won't get built.

Supporters of net neutrality argue that giving all internet users the highest speed and greatest volume of space available - whether or not they contribute to the cost of building that capacity - is the only way to guarantee that no one will be discriminated against on the basis of what they want to say. However, there is very little incentive for carriers to build infrastructure if they have no way to recoup their costs. Without such an incentive, many new high bandwith applications, such as medical technology and communications for emergency personnel, many not be feasible.

Simply put, I believe providers shouldn't be able to block access to any other providers on the basis of content, and access to the capacity that has been built by the public should be open to the public on equal terms. But, access to future capacity should be open on equal terms to those who share the cost of its construction.

Thanks again for caring enough to get involved, and please don't hesitate to contact me again in the future.

Sincerely,

John Barrow

 I couldn't find anything about it (and hope this sub is appropriate). Does anyone have any idea?

Will voice calls via Hangouts have to use a Google Voice number or will it use the phone's? 




 It's been posted on their Facebook page.

Thanks for all the great memories! 










































































 I'm hearing that the water tower by the ANGC busted due to the earthquake. It was leaking before then - big time. We saw water cascading out about 15 minutes before the quake. 









 And which is worse? 
























 Apart from PDF Mergy, I haven't been able to find many apps that allow manipulation of PDFs. I'd really like to be able to split a PDF into two, rotate a page, and perform OCR.

Any suggestions? 














 I just received an email allegedly from Google (no-reply@accounts.google.com) stating that someone attempted to sign into me Google Account. The email has the standard blue button link to reset my password.

I was initially suspicious so I did a quick search and it seems bogus. Can anyone here confirm that it is not legitimate? I reported the email as a phishing attempt.

Thanks! 









 Is anyone else having this problem? My Nexus 7 (2013) randomly reboots at least once a day, but usually more. It's annoying and since I use it for work, it often happens at critical moments.

Also, I have Google Maps on the home row and it is removed every time it reboots. All the other slots are folders so I'm not sure if that's the cause or if it is something specific to Google Maps. 









 An earlier thread had a discussion about how we used to count by suns/daytime and nights. It makes more sense for a "day" to begin at roughly sunrise. Was this standardized by the same folks who standardized the calendar? 



















 [Google Calendar Auto-fill](http://i.imgur.com/p6BYAd4)

Confirmed: [Google Calendar taps Maps for location autocomplete suggestions, and shows relevant events as you search](http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/12/04/google-calendar-taps-maps-location-autocomplete-suggestions-shows-relevants-events-search/) 














 We drove about 450 miles both ways. Using Maps, we were able to anticipate delays and find routes around them.

All told, we dodged 4 massive jams. It's hard to know how much time we saved but we figure at least an hour, maybe two. 




 For one, it assumes household finances are analogous to government finances. And it tells us _nothing_ important (because it's a low bar we all meet - to be a functioning adult is to balance a checkbook).

Is there a way that it is/can be used that is not a cop out? In my experience, it is usually said by someone who doesn't want to be tied to the social platform of the Republican party, but more so doesn't want to be thought of as a liberal or a Democrat.

I've thought this for years and am genuinely curious that I am missing something. 












































 I'd like to be able to give my boyfriend access to my reminders (and vice versa). When we are running low on, say, toilet paper, either one of us can say: "Remind me and [boyfriend] to buy toilet paper at Kroger."

When either one of us goes to Kroger... ding!

It seems like it would be easy for Google to do, and I'm sure there are other ways it could be used. Thoughts, /r/Android? 



















 Both cheeks when the shadow covers the entire lane; left or right when it only covers the left or right portion.

I'm 31 and still love doing it. I tell myself it's why I have a bedonk. 














 I have very little knowledge of the net's infrastructure so forgive me if it's a dumb question. It just seems to me that the very nature of the internet makes it impossible to truly be anonymous. 



































































































 I apologize if this has been asked and answered. I searched this sub and Google but couldn't find an answer.

The sound works fine for seemingly everything else.

Thanks in advance, r/applehelp! 





























 Augusta, GA here! My boyfriend and I are planning a NYC trip during Masters weekend this year (April 12th to 14th). Neither of us have been there before and we need some help finding a hotel. Any reasonably priced but decent suggestions?

Thanks in advance! 




 Bottom line is as it appears: what can be done here? My cousin is such a good person - but she has decided that his lack of belief in the Christian god is a deal breaker.

I'm asking for effective advice... he wants to be with her. He does not want her to "convert" to his "religion"; but she is demanding the same.

Is this fair? And what can be done (in good faith)? 




 Karma is no more/less valuable than video game points. And the frontpage seems very similar to a final boss.

Does reaching the front page reduce this tendency? Front page fame is not worthless; fame a second time is still something.

Is a game any less valuable?
 














 The good Senator is deleting all the comments because he isn't getting the response he thought he'd get.

It also appears he edited the original post (I have a screenshot).

Who's up for showing him how wrong he is? I bet we can post comments quicker than he can delete them! 









 What is the best way to verify the team of someone requesting membership on G+? I've seen people suggest requesting a screenshot of the comm with the invitee's name (and color) but I'm not convinced that is very reliable.

Thanks in advance! 









 What is Google's end game? What will a fully unified Google Account look like and how will it enhance your life?

Also, what are some product combinations you would like to see? 














 When the app loads and locks in on the player, does it zoom in on your exact location on the globe? It does for me (and I assume Google wouldn't choose my small-ish city as a default, hence the possible dumbness). 









 We were trying to destroy resonators by a museum around midnight. They saw my parked car and got out to investigate. At this point, I don't think they knew we were there. 

We approached them and they asked what we were up to. We showed them the phone and explained that it is a global game of capture the flag created by Google. That simple explanation dropped the tension level down dramatically (they didn't know what they were walking into until then). 

They laughed and checked it out a bit. Told us not to get "attacked" ourselves, and went on their way. 

Overall, it was a good experience. We told them that they might start seeing more people like us and it's just a game.  




 From the letter posted on the investigation board:

SWEKU 
XKCWDJHOYELFMSBZUQI 
ARSMZEPIWOUK 
QUESIWOYHPMTKBGR 
KXUEGPMCOIW 
YWQNEUIXBGKRZHAO

Does anyone know what it means? It doesn't seem like a alphabetical substitution cipher... 




 Where's the big surprise? Does anyone know if anything actually happened tonight? 









 Call it an embarrassment of riches but I am getting email notifications constantly (I pretty much own every portal in the area and you get one for every resonator destroyed). 

Can we turn these GD notifications off? I suppose I can create a filter but that's just a work-around. 









 Check out the history map for a good overview of your work!

I've been active for about 7 days and... WOW! I've covered my area quite nicely.

(I'd post my map but it's all buggy this morning for some reason.) 




 Can anyone confirm (from an official source) that we are currently in beta?

And if so, what will be the major changes between beta and the official release? Obviously there will probably be no invitation process. What about items? Will they rain down from heaven like they do now (when turning in codes)?

I'd like to see this turn into a general "how the official release will differ from beta" thread if possible. 




 I have trouble pronouncing "pronunciation". Not because I wasn't exposed to or didn't know the correct pronunciation, but because a friend of mine hilariously mispronounced it one day while trying to defend his failure to properly pronounce another word (resulting in an ongoing joke that is over 10 years old). 

Now I legitimately get the the two versions confused and have to pause and mentally say it before verbally saying it. 



















 For me, it's the definition of despotism. The Civilization series introduced me to that word and it seems like a term that most people should know.

But I distinctly remember one of my best friends in college needing a definition from me when I used the term to describe Saddam Hussein's regime.

She is very intelligent and well-educated, which only made it that much more perplexing to me.

So, Reddit, what other examples are there?
