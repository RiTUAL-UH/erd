 Great!  Thanks so much! 




 Awesome, thanks.  If it turns out to be a particularly nasty bug, I'll definitely utilize that! 




 And your recommended course of action would be? 




 Any chance you could provide a link to those forums? 




 A friend asked for help "fixing" their computer.  They claim that IE won't close properly and they can't open Trend Micro.

I was thinking I would run some antivirus/antispyware scans (AVG?), and I'm definitely going to install Firefox and plead with her to use that instead.

But I'm not especially adept at troubleshooting computers, and without more details, it's hard for me to know exactly what the problem is.  I'll be going to her place tomorrow to try and help, and I was wondering if the brilliance here at reddit has some suggestions for how I should proceed.

 Not sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if he had a chip on his shoulder. 




 Getting robbed by a bank is a certainly a new twist on classic Wild West villainy...

 Upvoted for using a beverage as a verb.

Ohhhhhhhhh Yeah... 




 Ha, yes!  I blame Homestarrunner for this... 




 This one genuinely made me "lol"... 




 Don't suppress your doubts.  Don't run away from your doubts.  Embrace them, challenge them, and don't stop until they are satisfied.

The two rarest things in this world are a humble young man and a content old man.

Remember: Others  You
And: You != Infallible

Oh, and please don't use IE... 




 I actually like some Hannah Montana songs... 




 I got "The Spanish Inquisition"

 These people appear to dislike each other... 




 I would choose a super powered narwhal.
Then when the other person came to kill me, there would be an epic narwhal duel.  And that would be awesome.

You can choose from the 23-inch version or the smaller 12-inch one... :-) 




 you should definitely do something in return, like fry some bacon for her or buy her a howling wolf shirt...
