 It would be fucking impossible to get Taco Bell at 3 am 




 I think you're on to something here!  The CDC *is* looking pretty dumb lately.  




 For all you know I myself am a stripper, or I have children that are and support them even if I don't agree with them.
I've got an idea; How about we don't project our personal feelings on a given subject onto one another, insisting the other is wrong and we are right? Deal?
*Hint* THAT is liberalism. Live and let live. 




 I find it very irritating how often the article referred to him as "the stripper".

There's nothing wrong with stripping, but that's not all he is. 




 Nope, those are the fallen angels.
Cass is somewhere in there. 




 The things I've seen working at my copy shop (copying depositions from lawsuits and court cases mostly) have left me unable to sleep at night. I've met a few of the defendants, and I never would have known otherwise what they are guilty of. If ignorance is bliss, knowledge is a burden.  




 The biggest thing I think he's missing here is that just because his friend or people like him may not have laid a hand on an underage person, but someone else had to in order to create the content he's "harmlessly" viewing. He didn't do the abuse, but someone with a camera has to in order to catch those vile images. This perpetuates the market for such images and videos. Other sick people are fulfilling a need created by these 60 year old white guys. Cut off the demand, the supply withers and dies and no more children are harmed.

Edit: phrasing 




 He makes it seem so effortless he might as well be doing the waltz

 When i got the job offer for my original position it included a contract stating I would get a monthly bonus based off the store's income for that month. The percentage wasn't specified, but both myself and the business owner signed it. I've been with my employer for a little over a year and a half now, have sense gotten a promotion and 2 raises but have only gotten 3 bonuses totaling $200, the last one being over a year ago. We haven't posted a single loss since I've been here, and we just wrapped up our best month of the year. Well, I get my check today and...no bonus!! This is really starting to piss me off. I've talked to the owner about it before and all I get is "yeah, we haven't been doing very well. Not a lot of profit." But as the manager I have full access to our finances and I can see that we did *worse* those few times I did get a bonus compared to our lowest month this year! How do I approach this without calling my boss a liar or cheapsake? I really need this job but I'm completely being used here.


EDIT: Thanks for the advice! I'll that those wise words and see what I can make happen :) 




 "Don't mind me, sir. Just here to snake the pipes." 




 That is cool as hell, I'm personally impressed!  









 All jokes aside, this is a really beautiful photo 




 This creates a lot of pressure to make a decision when I just want an apple
