 You really don't want to fake it. If you feel you absolutely have to, you have to be careful so you don't get caught in a lie. But really, it's best to use your real experiences and just make it sound good. You can tweak small things. But don't ever put a job you didn't do! There are ways to find out if you actually did it or not. 

By honors I just mean academic awards/achievements. Like does you school have an honor roll (distinction for making good grades)? 

Those skills are a good start. Employers tend to want people who are excellent communicators and being able to speak multiple languages is a plus. 

You can definitely include sports, especially if sports are really all you have. If you did get most improve award, that could show you can learn new skills quickly and effectively. 

Think about the skills sports have taught you and how you can apply them to the work force. Were you punctual to all practices? Are you a team player / do you work well in a group? Did you learn excellent time management skills (having to balance sports with academics)? Are you dedicated / do you have a strong work ethic? Were you ever a leader - did you ever effectively communicate between all your team members? Did you ever have to solve conflicts amongst team members? Are you used to working under pressure? Can you work with all types of people? If any of these things apply to you, put them on your resume. Employers are looking for these things - they want to see that you can work with people, that you can solve conflicts, and that you are reliable.

 It's been a year since I studied conditioning, but I believe an unconditioned response can be replaced by a conditioned response. An unconditioned response cannot be created. Instead, it is a reflexive response elicited by a stimulus without learning. For example, whenever dogs see food, they salivate. The salivation in response to seeing food is a reflexive response, thus making it an unconditioned response. 

Now, a conditioned response is a learned response, and that can be changed or unlearned. In /u/tossedidiot's example, before the experiment the girl probably responded to the bunny with either indifference or by wanting to pet it - this is an unconditioned response. But then experimenters added a loud noise (a neutral stimulus) which would make the girl cry. Pairing the loud noise with the bunny made the girl learn to cry whenever she saw the bunny. The crying is now a conditioned response (NOT an unconditioned response). In this instance, the conditioned response COULD have be unlearned if the experimenter's were to repeatedly present the bunny without the loud noise OR they could use positive reinforcement (such as giving the girl candy whenever she went near the bunny or whatever).

**TL;DR** An unconditioned response is a reflexive response to something, but it can be changed in that a conditioned response replaces it.

 Ah, resumes. What fun! My husband graduated from college in May and I helped him with his resume. I took a class that helps with finding jobs, so I'll post some tidbits from a handout I received. 

**TL;DR** - Objective is 1-2 sentences; Use standard fonts like Times New Roman or Arial; Include information that pertains specifically to the position for which you're applying (don't put in useless information just to "fill" your resume); Describe activities in terms of results and accomplishments; Show you're a "doer" by using action words such as "accomplished", "initiated", "established", etc when describing your activities; Make sure your resume format is consistent; Read the job description/advertisement for the job and use any words the employer used to describe the job; Grammar and spell check!; You can put a "spin" on things to make yourself sound better, but never ever ever EVER lie on your resume. 

**The Objective**
The objective is a concise, one- or two-sentence statement that appears as the first major section of 
your resume. It communicates two things: what sort of job you are seeking, and what skills you have to offer. 
There are many different approaches to writing a job or career objective. Most styles focus on elements such as 
the position, the field, or the job-seekers particular skills. You may also choose to create an objective that is 
made up of a combination of those elements. Your objective may be oriented to: 
* The position  for example, A position as a social worker providing services for the aged. 
* The field  for example, Desire a position in the social service field working with youth. 
* Your skills  for example, A position utilizing counseling, research, and proposal-writing skills. 
* A combination  for example, Seeking a position as a public relations officer in a medical facility. Wish 
to utilize skills in communications, needs analysis, and photography. 

Another option is to write an objective that states both a starting position and a long-range goal. Therefore, your objective may be written to focus on: 
*Results  for example, A sales position utilizing strong organizational skills and the ability to work on a 
self-directed basis, where I can develop a sales territory and generate new business. 
*A long-range goal  for example, To secure a management trainee position with a large department store 
with eventual goal of becoming a store manager. 

**Font   Format**
Font choices should be classic: Arial, Times New Roman, or Tahoma are traditional, professional, and easy-to read. Font size should range between 10- and 12-point, with the only exception being your name, which is usually written a few points larger. Bolding, italics, underlining, and all-caps can be used effectively to emphasize headings and create a visual break between information. There is no prescribed way of making these choices, but be consistent.

When printing your resume, use high-quality stock paper of at least 20-pound weight that is available at most print shops and office supply stores. Conservative white, off-white, tan or light gray are generally acceptable colors.

Your resume should be crisp and clean looking, and visually appealing to the reader. Use white space effectively. Avoid cramming and crowding. Use spacing to accentuate sections 
and headings

Normally a one-page resume will be sufficient. In virtually no instance should your resume exceed 
two pages. Make sure your descriptions of your work experience and/or extracurricular activities are results-oriented. Describe activities in terms of results and accomplishments.

Make revisions, and make sure there aren't mistakes.

**Experience**
Don't worry if you've had limited or no experience. By customizing your resume, you can present your accomplishments and experiences in an effective way in  relation to the position for which you are applying. If you have difficulty expanding upon your work experience, or are concerned your jobs werent glamorous or relevant, the following may be helpful: 
* First, describe your responsibilities using action words such as created, planned, analyzed, or 
initiated. Show you are a doer. You can probably find a list of words online, or I have one if you want it.
*Next, think about the transferable skills you gained from each experience. Examples of transferable skills 
include oral or written communication, interpersonal skills, working effectively in a team, leadership, and 
research or analytical skills. They are transferable because you build on them and carry them with you as 
you move from job to job. Employers often value these abilities as much as, if not more than, technical skills. 
* Finally, ask yourself which of your job duties and accomplishments will matter most to the employers you 
will be pursuing, and place those most prominently on the work experience portion of your resume. For each 
job, develop (typically) two to four phrases or sentences, using your lists of action words and transferable 
skills, which describe your key responsibilities and achievements. 
* You will also benefit from considering the description or advertisement for the job to which you are applying. 
Look for keywords that the employer uses to describe the skills and qualifications being sought for the position. Identify overlap between skills you possess and skills the employer is seeking, and be sure to emphasize those phrases and keywords in your resume.

Remember to include any honors you've received.

 Woo! I am about to graduate with a degree in English - Creative Writing. Have an upvote for busting the myth that all people with creative writing degrees work as baristas.

Have you begun the publishing process for your first novel? 




 Mr. Krabs: Do you smell it? That smell. A kind of smelly smell. The smelly smell that smells... smelly... Anchovies.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: ANCHOVIES!

Also, the best advice from Patrick: When in doubt, pinky out.
 




 Interesting. The coin is the same on both sides, which made me think it wouldn't be legal tender, but I wasn't sure. Thanks for the information! 









 I still have hope that we will see LSH on the show, and let me explain why.

Did anyone watch How I Met Your Mother? While the show was still on air, fans had a theory that the mother was dead the whole time. Then in an interview the actress who played the mother debunked that theory, saying it was just a ridiculous conspiracy theory created by fans and that the mother is not dead. Guess what fucking happened on the last episode? So, the actress lied about the show's ending!

What is the moral of this story? Trust no one. People who are involved with making shows lie all the time to throw off fans. Thus, I hope they haven't officially decided to not include LSH.

 My school's English club has had the same issue as you. Our member involvement has been very low. Last semester, we seriously only had about 5 active members. I know one reason why we've had low involvement is because very few people know we exist, and even fewer know what we even do. So first and foremost, I would say promote your club as much as possible! Hang up posters, ask professors in the English department to inform their students about the club, go where students hang out the most and hand out flyers, or even have tshirts made and have members wear them.

At my college, people love volunteering. I would considering finding a way to get your club involved with volunteer activities. For instance, last semester my club did a book drive. First, we had people bring in old books they didn't use any more, then we sold them for pretty cheap (anywhere from $.25 to $1 each) on campus. We raised about $500 and all proceeds went to our local children's hospital so they could buy books for their library. You could do some sort of fundraising event for local organizations that promote literacy. 

Another thing you could do just for fun is a book swap. I know people want to read books, but books are expensive to buy or they just can't find something good to read. So you could throw a small party or something and have people bring old books they don't want and they can swap books with other people. 

People love contests and prizes. You could hold writing competitions. My group is planning on holding a campus wide poetry contest and the winner will get something like a small gift card to a local restaurant or bookstore or something. So hold flash fiction contests, poetry contests, things like that and give away small prizes.

Our club also has it's own publication, a literary magazine which accepts and publishes the best analytical essays. We were able to get a grant to help with the costs of printing and whatnot since it's professional, but I guess you could do the printing and stuff on your own if you want to do it on a smaller scale. We accept submissions from late fall through early spring and publish the magazine late spring. Once submissions are closed, we read through everything and pick the best, then we do light editing (spelling and grammar). You could consider starting something like this, and you can publish any type or writing (creative or academic) you want. If you guys like creative writing, you could put together a magazine of poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, novel excerpts, etc. People at my school love this. The group in charge gets to act as editors and students get their work published, both of which look good on resumes.

Hold open mic events. Invite people to come and read poetry or an excerpt from a short story they've written. Make sure to have popcorn or pizza to draw people in, or you could ask to hold the event at a local coffee house. 

Do you have a local company that puts on plays? We have a local Shakespeare company, and every year we get together as a group and see a play. 

People love free stuff, so offer free pizza or any free food or whatever at meetings.

That's all I can think of for now. In short, promote your club as much as possible and offer free stuff. Good luck!

 Me: Did you know euthanasia is pink?
Husband: What do you mean? Youth in Asia are yellow.

Because apparently euthanisia sounds like youth in Asia... Face palm.  




 I originally posted on /r/pics, but this subreddit seems to be more appropriate... 

As the title says, my parents called today to say they had to put our dog down. Sammie was 16; he would've been 17 in October. His health had been pretty poor for years now (he was blind and couldn't hear or walk well), but he was one strong pup. 

My parents gave him to me as a Christmas present when I was 5 years old. Today, I'm 22, married, and about to graduate college, so this dog has been around for a lot of major events in my life. It's like my childhood officially died with him. 

[A few pictures of Sammie.](http://imgur.com/a/0VvC0)

You were the first dog I ever had, Sam-Sam. Thank you for all the memories, for being a loyal companion, for teaching me responsibility, and for making me feel like I always had a friend. I am going to miss you.

Edit: Spelling 




 Thanks. I wasn't sure which place would be better... Perhaps I'll move over there.

 /u/sympathyboner is right about seeing the doctor and possibly getting a new pill.

I had a very similar experience with Lo Loestrin. I would have light breakthrough bleeding ALL THE TIME and I would miss my periods. My doctor changed my pill to Generess Fe a few months ago and everything is back to normal.

Also, since you mentioned that you were stressed, keep in mind that stress can screw up your period.

I hope all is well :) 




 "Irregardless" drives me insane. It's "regardless" you illiterate swine!
