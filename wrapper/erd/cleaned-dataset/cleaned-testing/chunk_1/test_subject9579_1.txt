 Lilly reads Melchio's SBB as an attack on your team so it fills your BB gauges. 




 My Darvanshel is 6*, still working on getting SBB (BB is 8/10)

Just sent you a request
 




 I sent you a request.

Currently I'm running either Thief God Zelnite or Guardian Darvanshel

Lvl 88 




 Thanks!  I guess I just wanted to hear that I'd get there eventually.  LoL

Still working on being able to take full advantage of FH and harder Dungeons.  I have decent units, I just need to get them leveled/BB'd/evolved. 









 Added you. IGN: Jaird

Thanks for the opportunity! 




 At some point does the Zel become easier to accumulate or do you just run out of units to fuse/evolve?

I have what I need to cover necessities but I'm almost ready to evolve my Zelnite and Darvanshel which will leave me basically broke again.  




 Oh, ok.

I don't have either of them, so that explains that. 




 What are the Bulbs used for?

I can't find any info 




 Thanks. I think I have enough other units to cover what I need so I won't be holding on to my duplicates. 

I could use the space anyhow.  




 I cashed in a bunch of gems trying to go for Darvanshel (Good news is I got him) and I ended up with some duplicate units.

Is it worth it to keep multiple copies of units or should I just feed them to their big brothers/sisters for BB points?

Duplicates I have:

Lucina (L) x2

Mariudeth (B)  (L)

Bran (G)  (L)

Ahvel (G), (O),  (L)

Lilly Matah (L) x2 




 Hello, I'm not exactly new to BF but I've kinda been winging it thus far. I need some advice/help putting together a squad. 

Here are my units (in descending rarity order):

6 Star
Wise Mage Elimo
Black Lotus Lunaris

5 Star
Fire God Vargas
Rakshasa Vishra
Axe King Mariudeth
Goddess Hatsune Miku
Goddess Emilia
Bolt Mallet Elulu 
Lightening Sage Bran
Crusher Uda
Cavalryman Sodis
Scythe God Alice
Goth Idol Kikuri
Magistra Lira
Inferno Queen Elza

4 Star
Great Thief Zelnite
Commander Weiss
Sage Bran
Thunder Beast Ahvel
Lead Engineer Garnan
Bahamut 

I also have a couple 3 stars that may or may not be relevant (I'm not sure)

Who should I be focused on advancing? Do I have what I need to tackle some of the bigger challenges/quests?  

I have attempted the Research Lab once and one or two of the Grand Gaia missions but not recently (before I had and 6 star units for sure).

Thanks in advance for any help you can give.

 Seems fairly self explanatory. 

Obviously natural Chicken Porridge isn't shelf stable and they don't have a cooler.
