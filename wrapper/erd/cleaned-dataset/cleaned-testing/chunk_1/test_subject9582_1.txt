 I think the driver had his seat belt on, but he took a tree limb to the face. 




 An earlier post got me thinking. We know that they went to school together, was Petey sneaking up the stairs (boys can't go up the girl's stairs) as a rat to crawl in bed with Bertha?

It's my headcanon that that is how Peter piqued her interest in Albania, because they had known each other at school.

Pimp Daddy Peter.  




 
I like the way you think. I think some of the other girls in the dorm might have noticed a large black dog or a stag coming in. Maybe not so much a rat that could sneak up and crawl in bed with.. I dunno, Bertha Jorkins perhaps? 




 ..and he put him through the motions three more times to try to show them how it's done. "Look at his eyes." 




 This is pretty much it. Riddle had to kill Harry in order to destroy his own bit of soul inside of Harry, essentially a creator destroying his own horcrux.

Albus has spoken a few times about certain types of magic...

Edit: I know that Harry was not a *true* horcrux, but he was still carrying a bit of Voldemort inside of himself.
 




 [This](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Cornelius_Agrippa) is another appearance of the word. 
























 Was George losing his ear an homage to Van Gogh? It wasn't specified in the book as to which ear he lost, but the film had his left ear bandaged. 









 "Say, what's your name?" the bartender asked the first duck.
"Huey," was the reply.
"How's your day been, Huey?"
"Great. Lovely day. Had a ball. Been in and out of puddles all day. What else could a duck want?" said Huey.
"Oh. That's nice," said the bartender.
He turned to the second duck, "Hi, and what's your name?"
"Dewey," came the answer from duck number two.
"So how's your day been, Dewey! ?" he asked.
"Great. Lovely day. I've had a ball too. Been in and out of puddles all day myself. What else could a duck want?"
The bartender turned to the third duck and said, "So, you must be Louie?"
"No," she said, batting her eyelashes.
"My name is Puddles." 









 How fcuking awesome was Minerva McGonagall? Such a powerful person, and the penultimate school marm. 

3.. 2.. 1.. GO! 




 He's just a big stoned kitty. 




 Would have taken over the DADA position after the second war? We know the jinx was lifted when Voldemort died, so would it have been a student from Harry's generation or would Minerva have brought in someone from the outside? 














 When they're on the hut on the rock, Petunia says that her sister would come home and turn teacups into a rats. That's big magic for a young witch.

Do you think the *Fera Verto* spell in CoS film was based on this bit in the first book? 




 I know that we only saw them one time with Lockhart, but damn those fuckers can do some damage. I would hate to have a nest near my home.

Same goes with Doxies. How do they even get in your home to begin with? 




 A laywoman was driving down the street in a sweat because she had an important meeting and couldnt find a parking space. Looking up toward heaven, she said, Lord, take pity on me. If you find me a parking place Ill go to Mass every Sunday for the rest of my life and give up drinking wine.
Miraculously, a parking space opened up right in front of her destination.
The woman looked up to heaven and said, Never mind, Lord; I found one on my own. 














 It just seems like they should have had some sort of protection around their wands. Perhaps a magically reinforced thin piece of steel that slid over your wand, except for the handle and tip, to keep it from breaking. That would have helped Ron, Neville, and Harry at least.

Does this seem ideal for anyone else? 














 You can hang the picture with only one nail. 




 Obviously, Voldemort used him for his savagery. Do you think there was ever a time when, like Draco, he regretted it? 

Seriously, that man was the foulest of the foul. Do you ever think there was a time Tom Riddle sat back and said, "DAMN!"?
 




 That's okay, the right side was weak. 




 When I bought DH at the midnight release, I stayed up all night reading. Around 06:00, my wife was getting up and getting ready for work. She came in to the living room just a bit before Percy tumbled out of the portrait of Ariana in the RoR. At that point, I sat the book on my lap and started clapping, "YAAY!" She looked at me like I had a third eye in the middle of my forehead.

My question is, what was an exciting part for you on your first read-through? 














 Ready.. steady.. GO! 




 To cast Gemenio on a human? 









 Bitches hate that. 









 What are your favorite chapters of the series? and why? 









 Two guys driving through Texas get pulled over by a state trooper. The cop walks up and taps on the driver's window, the driver rolls it down, and the trooper smacks the driver in the head with his night stick.
"Ow!" says the driver. "Why'd you do that?"
The trooper says, "You're in Texas, son. When I pull you over, you'll have your license ready."
The driver says, "I'm sorry, officer; I'm not from around here."
The trooper writes the guy a ticket and gives his license back, then walks around to the car's passenger side and taps on the window. The passenger rolls the window down, and the trooper smacks him with his night stick.
"Ow!" says the passenger. "What'd you do that for?"
The trooper says, "Just making your wish come true."
"What the hell does that mean?" asks the guy.
"Two miles down the road, you were gonna say, "I wish that lousy asshole would've tried that shit with me!" 




 Half a dog. 














 I only have three jets recycling because only three of my 38 hero roster don't need training. 
























 I think it's the Dakotas, Idaho, Alaska and Wyoming. 




 How do you plan on celebrating? 














 ..I guess it will be a silent film? 



















 How jealous is Meg of Lily Mae? 
























 Mine would be Beedle. I read them to my daughters as bedtime stories for a few months when it was released. 














 A 6-year-old and 4-year-old are upstairs in their bedroom.
"You know what?" says the 6-year-old. "I think it's about time we started cussing."
The 4-year-old nods his head in approval.
The 6-year-old continues, "When we go downstairs for breakfast, I'm gonna say something with 'hell' and you say something with 'ass'."
The 4-year-old agrees with enthusiasm and they head down stairs.
When their mother walks into the kitchen and asks the 6-year-old what he wants for breakfast, he replies, "Aw hell, Mom. I guess I'll have some Cheerios."
Mom slaps him -- Whack!
The older boy flies out of his chair, tumbles across the kitchen floor, gets up, and runs upstairs crying his eyes out with his mother in hot pursuit, slapping his rear with every step. She locks him in his room and shouts, "You can stay in there until I let you out!"
She then comes back downstairs, looks at the 4-year-old and asks with a stern voice, "And what do you want for breakfast, young man?
"I don't know," he blubbers. "But you can bet your ass it won't be Cheerios!" 









 
about bullshit? 









 How envious of Harry was Draco? 

He seems like the sort of guy that would expect preferential treatment from his peers, then Harry comes along and produces a corporeal patronus in their third year, something that is seventh year magic or beyond.
I bet there are some fics on this, but let's hear what you lot think.

Edit: Does anyone care to speculate on what Draco's patronus might have been had he not been branded?
 














 [I love it](http://i.imgur.com/HPNqDgy.jpg) 




 Pirate walks into a bar with a steering wheel hanging out of his fly, bartender says, "Hey, you know you have a steering wheel on the front of your pants?" Pirate says. "Arrrrgh, it's driving me nuts!" 




 I think a bit may have rubbed off on her son as well. 









 Decaffeinated coffee, you racist fuck. 









 One says to the other, "You ever been picked up by the fuzz?"

"No, but I've been swung around by my tits." 









 There is a time to put the pipe down. I'm on my fourth bowl of Jack in two hours. 









 My wife and I watched them all last night, and when it was over we looked at each other with confusion. We were trying to figure out how they would go back to jail, instead of just the ladies and Donna. 




 Was Carla's face while Perry* is trying to save his buddy that could have waited another month for a kidney in *My Lunch.* I always get misty watching that. 




 What do you buy?
 



















 Sirius or the other Azkaban escapees got their wands back? 



















 Why did JK choose that name? Doesn't it translate literally to 'pretty sticks'? 














 As each book was coming out, I would re-read in preparation. After 07/DH I have read the series five or six more times, but it has fallen off lately. Now I just read for certain moments or excerpts, since I pretty much know when things happened.

I guess I am saying that I use the books as more of a reference point than reading cover to cover, unless I'm on a long car ride.

What says r/harrypotter? How many times have you read, and do you still? 




 A man lay sprawled across three entire seats in a theater. When the usher came by and noticed this, he whispered to the man, "Sorry, sir, but you're only allowed one seat." The man groaned but didn't budge. The usher became impatient.
"Sir," the usher said, "if you don't get up from there I'm going to have to call the manager."
Again, the man just groaned, which infuriated the usher who turned and marched briskly back up the aisle in search of his manager. In a few moments, both the usher and the manager returned and stood over the man. Together the two of them tried repeatedly to move him, but with no success. Finally, they summoned the police.
The cop surveyed the situation briefly then asked, "All right buddy, what's your name?" "Sam," the man moaned. "Where ya from, Sam?" the cop asked.
And with pain in his voice, Sam replied, "The balcony." 




 We know from *Snape's Worst Memory* that Remus was a prefect, and he sat and watched James and Sirius *levicorpus* Snape, and the hoopla with Lily, and Remus still did nothing. 

Why would you give a werewolf a prefect's badge for starters, and do you think Severus ever held a grudge while he was brewing the wolfsbane?

 














 How a phoenix is born? Are there a limited number to begin with? 





























 We know that Harry did a bit of magic during his primary school days, that must make a lot of work for obliviators. Some schools have over 3,000 students. 




 My daughter has a large stuffed chimp that she calls "Monkey" and all I can think of is Grandma's Boy. We just had a lengthy conversation about Monkey, and me being 8.5 I couldn't stop laughing. 




 Instead he made her a bunch of boats with barnacles and the smell of shrimp. 




 Got myself some the other night for the first time, and I am loving this strain. 




 Turn it inside out and shake the fuck out of it. 














 Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) and Emma Thompson (Trelawney) were co actors on an old BBC show called Tutti-Frutti.

If this doesn't belong here, I apologize. 




 I enjoyed the bits of Grawp, especially when Harry found out during the Battle of Hogwarts the "Grawp was, in fact, an undersized giant."

My point is, was he unnecessary? Order of the Phoenix was the longest book, and I think it could have been better if JK would have left out the parts about Grawp. 
 









 Mine would be Half Blood Prince. What a total mindfreak that was, always trying to find out what Draco was up to, Snape killing Dumbledore, Bill getting mauled, Fawkes singing his lament to the grounds, and the part that always got me was Fleur and Molly at the end. "And I shall do zat!" 




 Hello all, I'm new to reddit, and I have been a Potter fan since the first book came out. I just found this subreddit through the grapevine, and it looks fun. I look forward to having some good discussions!
