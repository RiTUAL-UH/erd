 If you're rooting the thing then 99% of everything I said is of moot consequence.

The hardware of the device is pretty much badass. .... with the one exception of the speaker.  the speaker sucks. it's on the back of the phone, easily covered up, is about as 'generic' as possible, and pales in comparison to even an average 'other' device.. let alone HTC's speakers... which are even better than my 14" Asus laptop...  leaving one of them playing music on my counter and walking around the kitchen serves almost the same function audio-wise... with the M8 actually edging out on certain aspects because the case of the laptop 'rattles' a bit on the higher notes.

the M8's speakers are great. I'll oftentimes have music playing on my phone when I get in my car and just set the thing in my cupholder and forget to even turn the radio on... just keep listening to the phone.  there are limitations, i mean, they *are* tiny speakers ... so, road noise can drown it out but.... my point is,  they're pretty freakin' awesome speakers.

aside from that... from everything I'm reading about the rumors with the G4... the only real difference will be the octa-core proc... and, the speed of both the G3 *and* the M8 are more than fast enough, imo.  ...hell, at that, from what I've been gathering on the chip specs/performance, the 4 main cores of the Snapdragon really aren't that much faster than the 4 cores in the 801. ... slightly but just barely-so... albeit, greater efficiency in layout of the chip, and smaller wiring.. so less battery drain *when* the 4 'main' cores are in use... ...as well, the ability to not only drop back to the 4 'half' cores for easier tasks... drastically reducing power consumption, but *also* the ability to utilize all 8 cores at once... ...and, if what I was reading is correct, better bandwidth from the ram *to* the proc so that all 8 cores don't experience bottlenecks in memory access.

but, again, really is a pretty moot thing. speed gains would be minimal, and I've never had a speed problem on either device (nor a ram-problem.. and the G3/G4 both are 3gb ram... M8 = 2gb).

battery life may increase... but, since it looks like they're sticking with a 5.5" screen with the g4.. but going for the increased resolution (3k vs 2k) ... it may be a wash... ....if you chose to keep the settings to 'max output' all the time....otherwise, if you keep it variable, the battery life would prob be just-slightly gained with the G4 over G3.

Kinda moot talking about or comparing given the G4 isn't even announced yet, let alone available ... 

but, my point is... even if waiting for the G4, the only real difference seems to be the jump up in proc-type (like the M9) and a slightly increased screen resolution (but the G3 *still* has higher res than the M9.... ....and, even my M8's resolution is more than high enough imo. te increased resolution of the G3 has never really been a noticeable 'thing' to me).

um... rooting   roms.  to each their own. I'm on sprint so I can't even root my G3, let alone load a different ROM on it.. but, I'm not sure I'd (really) want to anyway.  the only thing i'd really want to root my phone for would be to make it a wifi-server for my laptops and tablets.... and, at that, I use EasyTether on it with no problems... ...just requires a usb cable which, also, keeps it charged... using the phone as a modem drains the battery like none-other... esp with heavy usage... so, keeping it plugged in is something I do anyway.

that's actually where I keep my phone 99% of the time... in the back of my car plugged into an old laptop that's, in turn, plugged into a 12v power outlet in the back and all shoved into a side-net deal....... and i use the laptop/G3-combo as a mobile hotspot for my laptops   tablets while I'm in or around my car. 

The downtime is minimal, and the G3 seems perfectly 'happy' plugged in back there.  I only really ever remove it when I'm going away from my car and need to grab it to use as a modem wherever I'm going... assuming that place doesn't have wifi.  ... or 4g/LTE so my M8 can't serve both functions (modem *and* phone).

anyway, I've never had problems with my M8 in the nearly 2 years I've owned it. I consider it one of the best devices I've ever owned. but the G3 is still a solid phone, and any of the (not really existent) 'problems' with optimus will be replaced with the ROM.... .... I'm not *against* the G3, hell, I'm even *for* it... again, Infiniti makes a damn nice car! ... I'd be glad to own one. not just happy, but happy+.... but, vs an Audi?  that fucker's *fun* to drive! not just a pleasant drive when going somewhere, I specifically intentionally *make up* places to go with my Audi... just so i can drive it... ...same deal with the M8.  ...can't say that about my G3.

([this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA15T2MC0213 cm_re=acer_switch_10-_-9SIA15T2MC0213-_-Product) is my other 'favorite device' I have.  it's slower than my laptop, definitely *not* my desktop... but, for $200, I love this fucking thing!) 




  maybe I can add BlackBerry as being Jaguar

that one makes perfect sense! used to be great, now is just a Ford. Has less problems than it used to, but still costs an arm   a leg and gives subpar performance relative to the competition.

 Nokia (Microsoft I guess) can be Volvo

another perfect fit! definitely not the 'best' out there, but certainly still a great device... and those old box volvos from the late 80's-90's were super popular (like that old school nokia phone that *everyone* had and seemed to last for.f'ing.ever with no problems... could be dropped (wrecked) repeatedly and just. keep. going.  kinda boring, but an otherwise solid device.

perfect comparisons 




 imo, the M9 is just HTC catching up with what LG provided with the G3 a year ago.... actually, the G3 has a larger battery... that's swappable!, higher res screen, and a camera that's probably better than the M9.   the only real loss with going with a G3 *instead* of an M9 is the new processor... but, proc speeds are way faster in smartphones than most people could ever demand of them.

that just leaves price   ui.  personally? I'm a really big fan of Sense. period.    Optimus is great, but it isn't Sense.

I have the M8, I have the G3.  I can use both interchangeably, just gotta go in and adjust my google-voice settings to forward the calls from one to another.

at that, I almost never carry my G3. I've made myself for a month once. I grab it every once in a while and use it even now... forceably. begrudgingly. 

I just ... it isn't that Optimus is '*bad*', by comparison to every other UI that's out there (except sense) it's great! ...but, it lacks the simplicity yet functionality of sense.

I know that sounds horribly semantic   anal but... it's just how I perceive it.

at that, between the M8   G3, I'd take the M8 any day of the week and twice on sunday... ...*despite* it being a 'lesser phone'.  it has less ram, smaller screen, less battery/life, non removable battery, etc... but, the ram / speed is plenty and I'm pretty liberal with the number of apps i install and keep on there... keep running in the background, etc.

The only real limitation to the M8 vs the G3, imo is the camera. the camera absolutely blows in the M8. i mean, for basic shots? it's 'fine', but, there are many pictures that I've tried to take and been disappointed in.  The G3's camera is great.

on the other hand, cameras are much less important to me so this limitation (though supposedly 'fixed' in the E9... *not* the M9... that camera lacks image stabilization and, from what I've seen, it's a major limitation... the E9's is strongly rumored to have it)... ...where the M8 absolutely monkey-stomps the G3 on... and, most other 'devices' that I own (laptops, tablets, etc) ... is also one that's much more important to me to begin with: speakers.

the G3's audio is paltry to begin with. Compare it to the M8 and it's like listening to.... a shitty pair of stock earbuds vs a really nice set of headphones that cover the ears entirely.    singular low quality speaker on the back vs dual high quality speaker*s* on the front.

it makes a huge difference. 

but, again, Optimus vs Sense. it's subtle. And, LG clearly did a very thorough job going through all the other handsets   tablets out there and narrowed down the best features. they did a great job at 'capturing the essence' of each out there... iOS, TouchWiz, Sense, etc....

and, did an awesome job programming it into Optimus... but, there're just a few features they lost, and, in day to day functionality, it makes all the difference in the world (to me) 




 Why not use them en mass? Why not keep the data indefinitely? Why not create tracking patterns of vehicles? Time/date/location/license plate # etc?

 




 I have both the M8 and G3. Much prefer my m8...shy of the camera.

Get an m9, or, better, hold off until the e9 is available.

Sense blows optimus away, imo 




 They'll get over it. Most already eat bugs all the time, they just don't realize it.

The environmental footprint/impact is certainly drastically reduced from my understanding.  I'd give it a few more years to get testing and widespread approval. But I'd imagine that by 2020 even t.supply    rural king will be selling the stuff 




 /r/drought cares. /r/californiadrought *really* cares. Like, cares so much it's its only reason for even existing


 




 Having both as G3 *and* an M8 for nearly a year now has made me realize I'm a bigger fan of HTC than I am LG.

I liken HTC to Audi, Samsung to BMW, iPhone to Mercedes, and LG to an Infiniti/Lexus hybrid.  I've always been an Audi guy. HTC the same. 

but, I've also owned a few Samsung devices (and bmws... and mercedes, and audis, and toyotas, and nissans... never a lexus or an infiniti.. though my parents   sisters have) ... ...it's a great device, for what it is... but, I'd much prefer the G3 over any samsung I've owned (tv's included).   ... but, even at that, HTC beats it. ...esp with the M9 essentially being a G3 with a newer proc (a year later *after* the G3 came out first).  the E9 on the other hand.... now *that*'ll be the device to have! 

Sense beats Optimus hands down. Optimus beats TouchWiz hands down. all of them beat iOS hands down.    I like mercedes, comfortable ride and will certainly get you there but... bah. boring! power? sure. those v8's are like tanks on crack... but, still tanks. the still-heavy but lighter Audi? granted not as fast as a BMW for the most part, but with the quattro? the handling blows it out of the water. throw on a supercharger for $5-6k on top of the naturally aspirated 4.2L v8 audi makes? ... combined with the handling on any road but a pure circle track and BMW can suck it. 

sure the gas will get'cha... charging my HTC is about as common as filling an Audi up with gas but.... well. fucking. worth. it.  and, come on, how far away is the average person from a car or wall outlet? and, even if they are, [these things](http://www.ebay.com/itm/2600mAh-Portable-Mobile-External-Battery-USB-Charger-for-cellphone-Power-Bank-/251719067117?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 var= hash=item3a9ba025ed) are $5.... and give nearly a 100% charge in of themselves. 

The G3 Optimus interface makes it cater more towards kids as some sort of 'toy' ... the HTC Sense is much more to the point, imo.... ironically, my business number is on my G3 and my personal number is on my HTC. luckily, google voice works with both and forwarding phone calls from my G3 *to* my HTC is just a 5-10 minute configuration issue.

that the HTC cost me $100 and the G3 $0? and that the G3 has basically the same specs (if not arguably better in some ways) than the just-announced M9? hell, even the yet-to-be-announce E9? ... all the more impressive. Infiniti makes some pretty bad ass car designs with some pretty advanced configuration-types. ...oftentimes *years* before the competition catches up.  Unfortunately, it's an Infiniti, not an Audi. 'cause Audi's fucking rock! that's why the bad guys drive 'em! ..and Tony Stark.  'RDJ' also does HTC commercials. This *isn't* a coincidence, fwiw 




  then the risk goes up exponentially as you increase the odds of a drone and an airplane trying to occupy the same space at the same time.

but the likelihood of this happening is so minimal...  I mean, airports with 'no drone/no fly' zones alone would drastically reduce the risk.  I mean, how often is a plane really flying low enough to hit a drone? ... take off   landing... that's about it.  initial ascent or descent but... again, 'no fly zones for drones' (said [Soup Nazi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVqBzP0xdKk)-style) would seemingly reduce this drastically.

That leaves small planes   helicopters ... and, again, the likelihood of this is so minimal, in my imagination, any helicopter that hits a drone... and... anyone that lets their drone be hit by a helicopter... was essentially asking for this seemingly nearly-entirely avoidable incident from happening. 




 it doesn't *just* bring down the price of feed, the birds are seemingly a lot healthier, happier, and grow more protein-dense meat, as well have the capability of growing 'plumper' in the process. ... depending on what *else* its fed, it can have a lot of meat. it can have a lot of fat. or it can have a lot of meat *with* a lot of fat.

insects tend to be really lean. they don't provide a lot of 'fat' to the animal, but... again, it's just a *part* of what's fed, not the entire thing.

but, better, they can be fed live, dead, or can be processed into various forms... kinda like soy basically. lots of potential here. 




 Why not do both?

Insects for humans *and* livestock? 




  If we allowed men a similar choice: before the fetus is too developed for a legal abortion, the father can choose - just as permanently and irreversibly as an abortion - to forever surrender all parental rights and responsibilities - without the consent of the mother

I've been arguing this for *years* now. Guys always cheer it, girls always think I'm scum.  ...but, within '30 days of notification' ... be it that the girl is pregnant or that a child even exists. ... so, some mother couldn't have the kid, struggle for years not having notified the father, get into some financial problems, then come back against the kid.  ... maybe even less time, but I feel '30 days' is a good amount of time in such that a 'rash decision' isn't made. 90 days depending on term of pregnancy would be even nicer...

but, the point is, guys have essentially no control over this. It isn't 'fair' really. I'm not arguing that it's 'right' or that it's a responsible or moral thing to do, but I think if an option for such a thing existed, there'd be a *lot* more thought towards having a kid with the idea being in the mother's head that she could always go after the father.

the question comes into play with what to do in the case of an unknown kid coming back against a parent for back child support. 

but, then, that would still apply, imo.  the father would have '30 days to decide' and, during that 30 days of finding out about this 18+ year old child of theirs, they can make the call on whether they want to try to be apart of its life ... ..or, say 'no' and keep going their own way.

if the father said 'yes' then never paid and the mother never came back for child support due to *not* wanting to play some sort of custody game ... that's different, the father has responsibilities and *didn't* follow their duty ... but, '30 days' (to 3 months) would be really nice.  ... and fair, imo.

granted, again, women the 'world over' would think of any father that does that as complete scum and 'not a man' but, whatever. that's for that father to deal with on an individual case scenario. 

but, you're absolutely right... something like what you typed would totally offer a way for this' monstrous crime' to have been prevented 




 ethanol from corn is stupid. Stupider still is that the US lets ethanol *only* come from corn (a few notable exceptions aside).

I'm not knocking ethanol (though it's clearly not as energy dense nor cost-effective as petroleum-based gasoline) ... I'm knocking ethanol from corn, esp when it's *only* from corn.

  I wouldn't volunteer to die today for it

well, if you change your mind.... you know where to find me :)

 I would gladly endorse feeding bugs to humans

I've posted *many* articles about this. I'm super-excited that this 'movement' is finally starting to pick up some steam. 

Insects are an excellent source of nutrients   protein.  Extremely efficient converters of resources, have an incredibly low pathogentohuman rate, and are incredibly fast growers. Of course an 'insect burger' would be about as delicious as a veggie soy burger deal the hippies eat ... so I don't see it replacing a big juicy cow of buff burger or anything... but, vs the 'whatever-tf-mc d's sells?' it'd probably taste *better* than what they try to pass off as 'beef'.  though, maybe better to start with the McD's in India first .. before taking it elsewhere. esp the US

 Australia 

I've seen aborigines eat bugs before. living ones at that. it wasn't for me but I was definitely offered.... I'd much prefer them cooked   seasoned than live   squirming 

 other perversions

again, don't disagree... as, again, I've posted many articles about insect eating.

 overpopulation

I think that people are too up in arms about this whole overpopulation water deal.   .... at least from the perspective that it *isn't* a 'solvable' problem.  as is? it's absolutely one. but, I've spent the past few *years* posting on reddit *various* ways to both address *and* mitigate the current problems.

I see no reason why the carrying capacity of the planet couldn't be 25, 50, maybe even 100 billion people.  though it'd get a bit crowded   uncomfortable at those levels... i see no reason it isn't *plausible* at least ... if not fully *possible*.   hopefully by then we're off the planet and terraforming Mars or Europa or something though... and/or have figured out some way to build land from water or something.   ... graphene-islands would be neat :)

but, *on* the over population deal... again, if you change your mind, you know where to find me ... :) 




 The Likud party is even worse than the US's neocon wing of the republican party.

I'm assuming, of course, that you're willing to volunteer to be one of the first towards this population-reduction you seem to think we need 




 it's in the bond-type of the atoms.... as well what they're bound to.

in SOC (soil organic carbon), the carbon is usually bound to other types of atoms ... these molecules are more easily broken down.

In biochar, the carbon is (for the most part) bound to other carbon.  and, *usually* not just with one electron being shared, but two or more sometimes even...

here're some links that may help

[Total Organic Carbon](http://soilquality.org/indicators/total_organic_carbon.html)

[Wikipedia: Soil carbon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_carbon)

Also, try google-image searching: '[biochar atoms](https://www.google.com/search?q=biochar+atoms newwindow=1 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=4mwCVaHbJcS6ggSw-4HgCA ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ biw=1745 bih=814)' and looking at some of the models/representations of the atomic structure.

note that in, say, [this one](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UJf2hWRhpFc/Um1ScIcwuDI/AAAAAAAADYs/tNZBI8r2rYk/s1600/composition.jpg) some of the hexagons will have a 'second line' next to them.. ..this is to imply that it's a [double bond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bond) between the carbon atoms there.  Double bonds are, as I think is pretty easy to imagine, twice as hard to break as.. single bonds.  

in the above link, take how the ethylene pic has a C=C bond but the acetone has a c-c-c with the middle c having a = to the o ... 

 next up, check out a google-image-search for: '[graphene double bond](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1 biw=1745 bih=814 tbm=isch sa=1 q=graphene+double+bond oq=graphene+double+bond gs_l=img.3..0i24.31078.32651.0.32852.8.8.0.0.0.0.77.444.8.8.0.msedr...0...1c.1.62.img..7.1.54.MzZWQLXoT3M)'  ...now, [graphene](/r/graphene) by default will have a double-bond... it's kind of inherent to its structure ... but, in the 'chicken-wire-like' structure it makes... as you can clearly see, each (carbon) atom has a double bond with each carbon atom that surrounds it.

graphene is also stronger than diamond.  there's (most likely) a *lot* of naturally occurring graphene in biochar. ...and biochar could serve as a source-material of carbon *for* graphene ... if-ever 'they' can figure out how to produce it in the quantities society would 'gobble it up'. 

in graphene, the electrons are, in fact, shared among *three* carbon atoms. ...though this still makes a double-bond between each individual atom to the next, but, in 'properly made' graphene, the electron would be shared '*equally*' between the 3, with no single-atom having more of a 'hold' on the atom than either of the other two. ... think the whole 'turkey wishbone' deal ..

the more controlled the graphene is during production, the more 'balanced' or 'equally' the electron will be shared between each atom.  'grades' of graphene will undoubtedly be a major component within the manufacturing business ... with cars requiring a 'lower level of refinement' than, say, 'airplanes' which in turn will be lower-still than, say, a space shuttle.

but, on the other end, cars would be *higher* than, say, the graphene used to make a kids latest transformer toy. ...*despite* the latter probably being subjected to more abuse during its life *than* the car! 

but, backing out to biochar ... again, it's (almost) all in the pics! biochar isn't *just* carbon-carbon bonds, it's *mostly* carbon-carbon bonds...  but, due to its 'lower refinement' than, say, graphene, more 'impurities' are intermixed within the bonds... and, these 'impurities' (read: other elements) break down easier over time and, thus, the biochar itself does as well... the 'stuff' that usually lasts 100+ years is where the 'everything else' bonds the carbon're bonded to have broken down and... ...you get ever-smaller pieces of biochar that're the stronger c=c bonds.

there's nothing about this that matches the ELI5 but... i highly doubt that you're 5 either :)

oh, edit: the carbon in [compost](/r/composting) is 'organic carbon' ... as such, most of the carbon in it is bonded to 'other things' (atoms) than carbon... and, when it *is* other carbon atoms, they're usually single-bonds. (single electrons shared).  ... and, even if they aren't, even in the extremely rare cases where it's a double bond... and, even, 3-4 of them... (3-4 carbon atoms each double-bound to one another) ... it's not biochar.   biochar is that 'huge honeycomb-like chaotic pattern of porosity'.   ...well, for the most part. I'm pretty sure the IBI's definition of biochar was kept pretty. freakin'. vague. for a reason.

but, either way, compost = organic carbon. biochar = inorganic carbon usually where the carbon atoms are connected with double- to triple- bonds. 




 'taste tests' are often done on feed-types. I can't remember if I posted one or not, but there was a study done on feeding [black soldier fly](/r/blacksoldierfly) to both fish *and* cows, pigs, chickens... ...they could go as high as 40% and no taste difference was detected in the flavor of the meat. BSF, to focus on a specific one, are essentially neutral on flavor. 

But, in *one* of the studies I read on it, they specifically stated that they were following the protocols set out by the feed industry specifically *for* this type of 'taint' in flavor.

Animals eat bugs all the time. Chickens, fish, etc seem to go crazy for them in fact. 

Think about it, what's more unnatural: a cow being fed grains that it'd unlikely ever have access to in the wild or a cow eating a ladybug on a blade of grass? 

now, obviously there's a difference between a few random bugs here   there vs a diet based on a high percentage *of* bugs.... but, insect eating is pretty dang common.  and I'd be really surprised if someone actually showed me a study where the results showed a statistical increase in feed-type (in the wild!) of corn over, say, cockroaches.

now, obviously your message (which I had to interpret because it isn't the most clearly written thing out there) states that you don't feel like feeding things that the animal wouldn't normally come across naturally ... ie, grain-fed cattle (or sheep or goats) *aren't* something that you really support *either* ... .... totally agree. I have anecdotally tested grass vs grain fed cuts of meat on people and 7x out of 10 (which is about how many times I've ever actually personally tested this... ie, 10x) the person can taste a difference between the two ... *despite* my attempts probably half the time to lead them to the other.

again, anecdotal and probably has just as much if not more on my *extremely* ***non***-scientific way of testing this... but, in the way the flavor, texture, overall experience is describe, grass fed wins more often than not.

but, again, I imagine there're some bugs in there.. obviously not at the scale that they suggest here, but there nonetheless

 It would seem like the best way to approach this would be to determine what the markets he's able to sell to are most-demanding.

If he's going to stick with the local market, then figure out *who* locally he plans to sell to. If he can arrange for product to be shipped, then that will of course expand the markets   demand-types that he can cater towards.... but, again, demand will more often than not dictate what's grown and, as such, is probably best determined *first*?

at that, you may want to look into SPIN farming. One of the more foundational things about that is intensive monoculture.... with crop rotations that cater to what the previous crop-type(s) *didn't* take from the soil... and, thus, what would be the cheapest to add *to* the soil to cater to the next season's crop-type.

You'd be surprised how much can be grown on a very small area that way ... and with the proper rotation schedule, how long one can go before needing to add much to the land to keep it producing.

 In over a billion years, the only thing microorganisms have managed to evolve as a resistance to iodine is increased biofilm production   slower metabolic rates. Evolving a resistance to it is pretty unlikely if it hasn't happen by now 




 Ran across [this paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20675020) the other day... and a few others of similar nature... while doing some research on the use of iodine for footrot on cattle.

Basically, any 'excess' iodine in mammals is excreted through their fluids (saliva, sweat, semen, most-often urine ... but also milk). It's been long-used (or had been, the increase in antibiotics has decreased the use of iodine for livestock, unfortunately) with great success towards a *medley* of infections in the livestock industry. 

I'd imagine that the increased iodine in the milk would help to sterilize *many* pathogens that could find themselves in non-pasteurized milk.

...and, I, for one, am a pretty big fan of iodine... I'd imagine it'd go a very long way towards helping to cut back the use of antibiotics ... saving them for all but the most severe of cases ...  or, at least, more like with humans, instead of giving them by default as a daily additive, only when the animal is actually *sick*. 

It may help them to stay effective a bit longer, reduce antibiotics in groundwater, and, if nothing else, cut the cost of them to the farmers.  Iodine is generally *much* cheaper than antibiotics... and, not just healthier, but actually a necessary 'thing' for the health   well being of the animal... as well those that consume their products

 I'd think that there are much better things to do with the poo.

anaerobic digestion comes to mind ... sterilizing it then mixing it with land *not* intended for food purposes. etc

but, poo-char has always just seemed like a silly idea. I mean, on the one hand, great.. sterilizing any pathogens in the waste... and creating char .... but, on the other, poo just *doesn't* have the density that wood does.   same with chicken litter, etc.

It just seems... like a poor choice of resource utilization. There are lots of minerals and other in the poo... again, anaerobic digestion then a steam sterilization ... then utilization on non-food-intended lands.   just seems... smarter.

neat they're using solar to provide the heat though ... leaves more storable gases for energy production later on... like, during the night :) 




 x-post: /r/biochar

[original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/BioChar/comments/2xiwm1/major_water_saving_initiative/) 




 check out the link to the Rice U article at the bottom of the sidebar... it should help clarify things a bit.

But, higher temperatures generally *do* produce a higher quality char... stronger carbon-carbon bonds, higher porosity, greater activation, less VOCs, last longer, higher surface area (same as porosity but feel it should be worded that way too), etc.

There *is* a bit more crystalization in the bond-types, from my understanding...   as well, you'll (usually) get less char per volume of feedstock (there are 'tricks' around this but they're usually 'trade secrets' ... understandably so).

*at* the higher temperatures, more of the elements *not* bonding together will leave the system .... the heavier minerals tend to stay behind though.

The 'ash' from biochar serves well to mix *with* the biochar, imo... just to help add back *some* mineral content or value, but, really, it's not enough... *esp* with the higher porosity higher-temperature-produced biochar tends to have (feedstocks *do* alter porosity).

technically though, it *is* gasification *via* pyrolysis that *makes* biochar ... so, your question is misworded a bit.  Maybe more fast vs slow pyrolysis?  higher temperatures, of course, allowing for faster pyrolysis.

but, again, the Rice U article... pretty much the silver bullet to this 'debate' imo.  as well the evidence that has been shown again and again that until the VOCs break down (which lower-T chars have more of) ... they'll act as a *repellant* to the char ... and, it is, in fact, the 'explosive removal' of these VOCs *from* the char that *adds* to the increased porosity.

Higher-T's char needs loading all the more though... ...it isn't just because the higher porosity 'pulls in' and 'on' nutrients in the soil (kinda-sorta 'robbing' the soil from the *immediate*-availability of these nutrients) ... or that it pulls in *more* of these because of the higher porosity... but, the higher activation also means that it can pull them in faster, deeper, and hold onto them a bit stronger.

Really critical to preload the char first ... and, sometimes just blending with compost-alone isn't enough ... though it certainly helps.  I've found that adding additional additives (seems redundantly worded) are necessary ... SeaAgri, Azomite ... simply rock dust, bone meal, etc are great, imo.   ... as well lots of microbes.  don't *just* blend it with compost (and minerals/additives) but add microbes ... even if it's simply adding back compost tea brewed from the very compost the char's in... ... I've played around with adding molasses   sugar to char ... but, that was a pain in the ass ... though, the theory still stands: the sugars in the char ... *along* with the minerals... would attract the microbes from the compost tea *into* the char ... but, again, pain in the butt... even hot molasses (or warm) was just a sticky mess.

but, compost tea the hell out of the char *while* it's mixing with the compost ... it'll help to both 'load the char' as well drastically reduce the lag-time before planting once added to the soil.

but, looking at your question again ... it isn't *just* about temp, it's about speed as well .... *too* fast and there's more crystalization, too slow and the bond-types break down and much more of the carbon will simply evaporate. 




 /u/eosha /u/turtleislandcastaway 

might want to look into SumaGrow.  there are some great videos online that talk about the channels in soil that the organisms in their mix create *in* the soil ... as well the fact that they sequester carbon at about a 2:1 ratio that they sequester atmospheric nitrogen.  ....so, not *only* do they (both) help to increase soil N levels * * SOC-levels, but they *also* help to sequester the excess (fossil) nitrogen being put into the atmosphere from the pumping/mining of fossil fuel sources.

This, in turn, helps to build the soil and do so in such a way that it helps the soil to increase its holding capacity .... and, in a form (N2) that the plants most benefit from.

building [soil](/r/soil) is the main way this will be 'contained' ... it'll also help to sequester carbon, reduce the run off of *other* nutrients, and increase the bottom dollar to the farmer who utilizes it.

really a win-win all around. 




 and Bush will lose to Rand.  It's a shame really. I'd prefer to see her serve at least one term... *then* Rand do a double.  




 [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWqwSlZPcO4) may help offer ways to help said 'drought tolerant plants' be even *more* beneficial to the soil 




 A short video that may help
[Mycorrhizae Helps Reduce Nutrient Run Off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uukhM3-feQk)

now, this is a promo video put out by Mycorrhizal Applications, Inc ... but they are by *no* means the only company out there selling mycorrhizal products ... but the vid does a great quick job at showing the 'mechanisms' behind it 




 I think it's deeper than that. They're only the crusty surface. ....but, nuclear energy is essentially infinite (for all intents   purposes).... Doesn't play well for the artificial scarcity of fossil fuels when it comes to keeping fossil fuel prices up and limiting the industrialization of countries you otherwise want dependent on *your* industry 




 to continue this line of thought is a waste of both of our time 




 you got it! nail right on the head!

edit: ??? 




 they don't need to know me to be glad to see that I'm getting off a plane and (presumably) with money their area didn't have before I brought it with me :) 




  and the United States still doesnt know what to do with more than 60,000 tons of radioactive waste that has accumulated at its reactor sites. Then theres the issue of nuclear weapons proliferation and national security to worry about, not to mention the environmental toll of mining for uranium.

hate to just straight knee-jerk respond to the opening paragraph but... well, like the rest of the article pretty much indirectly points to: that 'waste'? its *only* '[waste](/r/waste)' because of politics!  It's still radioactive *because* it has harvestable energy! 

To have that stuff just sitting there *waiting* for an accident or theft to happen is .... is just sloppy freakin' politics!

To *not* .... to not *just* utilize it for energy.... but to *not* 'burn it up' to reduce the radioactivity of it, to reduce the threat of it... ... from both a threat level *and* an environmental-disaster-waiting-to-happen level is sloppier *still*!

There's *more* than enough energy (in, arguably, the 'waste' *alone*) to power *all* of humanity at levels advanced nations have grown accustomed to over the past century  .... for.... well, for longer than we've been an 'industrialized species' .... reprocess it in breeder reactors and we'd have all the more time to more-easily endure any dry up in available fossil fuels.

It's beyond ridiculous that this has gone on for anywhere *near* as long as it has. If I were apart of *any* 'nuclear movement' ... pro- anti- or otherwise, I'd be on this like white on rice.   ...instead it's apparently better to push solar   wind and bitch about carbon. 




 ... or nobody? 




 It's always nice to have some place to go...get away from it all 




 x-post: /r/BioChar  




  Why even bother posting this crap?

*for* the specific reasons I'd already stated elsewhere in the comments here over an hour before you posted this comment.   




 Not sure I'm entirely 'missing the point' .... just didn't choose to type out my entire thoughts   feelings towards it.

 This is dubious and reveals the bias right off the bat. I'd argue that we're healthier and have better food availability than ever before, but we can let this slide.

... well, I *did* state that I thought the article itself was 'bullshit' ... for what *that's* worth

 Sounds made up.

probably was. again, 'bullshit'

 name/number of the patent?

the op didn't, the one I liked to in the comment that you're applying to ... as well made a separate link to it... [did though](https://www.google.com/patents/US20040161440?dq=paul+stamets hl=en sa=X ei=8dLrVL2XLcOeggTOsISIDQ ved=0CE4Q6AEwBw)

 How exactly would an insecticide eliminate the need for round-up ready crops?

the very text you quoted above it says 'biopesticide' ... and, later, 'pesticides' ... ...nowhere in the text you quoted does it say 'insecticide'

 Cheap, maybe, but nothing is free.

of course not initially .... but, I know plenty of people who give away compost tea left   right after brewing huge patches of it. I'd see no reason these same types of people wouldn't be willing to give away spores and 'concoctions' containing these 'biopesticides' would feel any sort of conservativeness towards going the same with what's talked about.

I, for one, have 'compost tea brewed' SumaGrow's diazotrophs out with seemingly noticeable results. ... as it was the only thing I threw in the brew and it created something pretty similar looking to compost tea when I've brewed it, as well worked pretty effectively on the areas I used it.  ..albeit, not as well as the original product itself, but enough that I've done it more than 'a few times'.

so, of course not 'free' ... but, who knows what can be figured out from it down the line?   ...unless you're including the cost of the gas to get supplies and such into your calculations?

 pesticides aren't just for insects

Again, the author is arguably an idiot. .... and the article itself (arguably) 'bullshit'
but, when I read this article, pretty much the first thing that jumped to mind was [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krk2CoE2FPs) and, with it, the fact that it doesn't really seem like Tradd Cotter is referring to 'insectes' *either* when he's talking about 'personalized mycomedicine'  .... so, author may be an idiot, but I seriously doubt the sole thing the Stamets approach would address would *be* 'insects'  ..and, probably instead a host of other 'infections' that plague desired yields of the crops of focus.

Also, you're responding to my comment, not the op itself... and, in it I feel I decently-enough covered financial elements of the bullshit ... i mean, article

 effective fungal based insect deterrent sounds great

again! so much emphasis on 'insects' when the text you specifically quoted above not just used the word 'biopesticide' but also was completely lacking the word insecticide! don't get it!

 If there were an unbiased and factually accurate article about it I would do some more research on it. 

don't worry, I did it for you.  hence the link to the patent. Research away from there ... ..unless, of course, you think patents are junk too?

 This 'journalism' is

.... bullshit. again, I feel I covered this in the comment to which you reply. 

but, still a really 'neat' approach ... ...and, along a line of thinking that may either yield a biological approach ... or, a chemical one from the compounds produced via this route ... and, I really see no reason *both* routes can't be possibilities.   .... I'm no mycologist but from what little understanding I have (and from videos I've watched and articles I've read with or written-by Stamets himself ... as well other mycologists) , I see no reason it isn't a possibility? 




 [this site](http://naturalsociety.com/this-natural-food-could-finally-put-an-end-to-harmful-pesticides/) has it in an easier-to-read format... fwiw 




 [An easier to read format of the same article](http://naturalsociety.com/this-natural-food-could-finally-put-an-end-to-harmful-pesticides/) 




 yeah, won't surprise me in the least. 

I found it [here](http://naturalsociety.com/this-natural-food-could-finally-put-an-end-to-harmful-pesticides/) in an easier to read format. Think I'm going to delete this one and repost it. That other site's layout pissed me off while reading it. I almost didn't myself.  

I also think the article itself is kind of bullshit, personally .... but I really like the idea Stamets is working towards.  A *ton* of potential there ... ...and, it doesn't necessarily have to be an 'either/or' scenario either.

Also, the way the article ends... ...the 'knocks them off their fictitious monetary pedestals they believe to be sitting on' is a bullshit line.

they don't *believe* they're sitting on it, they very much so are... ...and, 'knock them off'?  Ha!  ... they're loaded. They have billions at their disposal. There is *nothing* to stop them from redirecting (some of) it from their current line of investments and *also* directing it towards *this* line of research as well .... and then patenting the hell out of as much of it as possible and burying anyone who comes close to challenging those patents under mounds of legal paperwork that even the best law firms in the world would have trouble wading through.  

That's the thing about money: the more of it you have, the more you can throw in various directions.

Not that this is necessarily an easily-patentable thing, if at all in certain approaches ... but, the 'filth of idealism' of certain aspects of this article are vomitous ... *at best*.  ...and downright bullshit in other aspects.

Either way, really cool line of research   thought Stamets   Co are doing. 'Infinite' potential there. 




  However, the sunlight needed for photosynthesis could not so easily be multiplied. Instead, the process would require artificial light, which means enormous amounts of energy  even if efficient LED lighting could be employed.  The question is where you would get that energy, he says

grow switchgrass for energy   biochar. the gasification of the switchgrass provides a syngas capable of either blending or straight-replacing n.gas.  thus, again, providing both the energy   the biochar to power the leds and densify the crop growth.

 cultured meat

If the words of [Allan Savory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI feature=youtu.be) are to be believed, removing livestock from the land is a *horrible* idea .... from an environmental perspective.   ....my taste buds probably wouldn't be fans either

 Dietary Changes
In general, meat has a higher environmental footprint than a vegetarian diet, says Winiwarter. It takes more area to produce feedstock for an animal than it would to produce vegetarian food for humans.

switch to (human consumption) insects for basic protein needs in blends for the less adventurous, and in excellently prepared dishes for those who like great food!

switch to insects as a feedstock for livestock. not a straight-replacement, but a supplementation. Insect farming takes up much less space and provides a helluva lot of nutrients for animals that seem to have [*no* problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSOdfSNxxKA) eating them.  (obviously do this on a much larger industrial scale would be required than this 'backyard approach' ... but there're *plenty* of unutilized [wastes](/r/waste) that [black soldier fly](/r/blacksoldierfly) could help turn into a valuable commodity for the businesses that produce it.  (the stockyards   butchers that process said livestock's probably a pretty great place to start).

 There is no silver bullet to resolve the environmental damage of agriculture, Winiwarter says. Instead, future innovations will need to be carefully monitored and evaluated for potential environmental effects, in order to minimize damage of nitrogen pollution and maintain livelihood on earth.

the sentiment of this part is b.s.   Agriculture can *solve* a lot of civilization's environmental problems ... if done properly.   ....and very much so on an industrial level that is both easier *and* more profitable for the farmer.

biochar production, water filtration, retention, soil building, carbon sequestration, .... [nitrogen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazotroph) [sequestration](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012407679200003X) via [biological fertilizers](http://www.sumagrow.com/) ... ....assuming that fossil fuels aren't going anywhere, and understanding that intermixed with a lot of the gas, petro, and even coal that's 'mined' is also the nitrogen that was in the biomass that *made* those hydrocarbons ... ...fossilized nitrogen (just like fossilized carbon) is coming up   out along with it .  fields of fast growth perennials like switchgrass fertilized with diazophic bacteria could help to not just pull that nitrogen out of the atmosphere (upon release), but do so while utilizing it as a fertilizer *for* the fast growth, energy-dense perennials that, in turn, provide a hydrocarbon source that helps to alleviate the dependence on said fossil fuels to begin with .... while providing biochar, habitats, (carbon sequestering) soil building, water filtration, water *retention*, and a cheap easy way for farmers to make a buck w/out having to destroy their land and work their asses off farming soil depreciating crops like corn, soy, etc.

Agriculture is a *solution* .... *not* a problem.   ....if done in ways that help make it so. 




 I have some friends that work (or have worked) for various refugee programs/non-profits ... great work. awesome programs. I really like that Louisville is so active in that area..    ....and there definitely seems to be a good deal of them, but I'd've been surprised if the number was at *seven percent*, let alone seventeen .... I wouldn't imagine refugees accounting for any more than 2% of that.

I'd like to find a statistical breakdown on zipcodes, ethnicities, sex, etc ... ...I'll try to remember to do a search for it when I get a chance.  ...just to satiate my personal curiosity.

It's unfortunate either way. I like the seed/garden idea. I ran across [this video](http://www.ripeandready.com/2015/02/gangsters-veggies-farmin-in-the-hood/) the other day ... ..it's kinda long and I'm not sure that it's *entirely* applicable to Louisville... I really don't think we're *that* 'hardcore' here but I couldn't stop thinking about a lot of the condemned homes in the west end ... ...or abandoned lots... benefiting from this.  ..really *any*where benefiting from this. I own a few vacant lots scattered all *over* town... southend, out bardstown rd, lyndon, etc .... I suppose I could start something on those instead of just watching it on the webtube.

thing is, you can't (easily) grow toilet paper... so I'm not sure it'd really reduce the number of people on the stamps.  ... just maybe help them have a better something to trade 'em in for (seeds). 




 Oh I didn't doubt the number, it just shocked me that it was so high.

Crazy that Jeff co. is that busy (period, let alone) compared to the rest of the state.  




 That 17% of the city is on food stamps is definitely a statistic I didn't imagine I'd read today.  ....even *seven* percent would've shocked me. 




 /r/Fluoride will prob have some pretty good info on it.

um, could search /r/conspiracy for 'fluoride' and I'm sure some results would pull up *there* as well.

um, could google: 'fluoride controversy', 'fluoride awareness', 'fluoride conspiracy'  

... then, to make it simple, there's always the ['Water fluoridation controversy'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation_controversy) wiki article.

but, the shortest way I can try to explain it is basically... the body needs fluoride, but only in trace quantities ... microgram quantities, and, very low ones at that. Fluoride is the lightest element in the halogen group, it chloride   bromide (elements the body *also* needs, but *only* in trace amounts) block the iodine/iodide that the body *really* needs vs those.   Iodine is needed (iodide is just a different 'form' of iodine) in *gram* quantities, not milligram, not low digit microgram, but double-digit gram quantities.  ...and it is not only super low in our diet, the RDA (recommended daily allowance) is 100-1000x below what it should be (150mcg ... vs the japanese, in contrast, consume upwards of 50mg and above a day.. every day. and also have just about the lowest rates of disease in the world.. .... from brain disorders to cancer to infectious organisms like viruses, bacteria, etc)

Even the ADA (american dental association) states that there's more than enough fluoride in our water for their purposes ... let alone our toothpaste... that any additional is toxic. We consume huge quantities of fluoride, daily. it's all but unavoidable, even if you're trying to avoid it (fluoride-free water, whole house fluoride filters, etc).

Many communities around the world (canada, europe, japan, etc) have looked at the evidence and voted to *remove* it from tap water ... and... well, they're fine. better than fine in many ways.

but, maybe the *best* way to explain it would be [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr2bSL5VQgM) 




 well, the 2% is what you do per weight of feed ... and I was more saying per 100# of body weight ... ...   two different 'things' for it to apply to

but, you're absolutely correct! 2% of 100# *is* 2lbs! :) 




 I've read about 1 tablespoon per 100lbs of weight .... would that be about the same as the 2% ratio you're getting? 




  Diatomaceous earth is silica dust, and can cause silicosis or lung cancer.

so *that's* why you mentioned the respiratory bit.

it seems almost *too* 'miraculously effective' *not* to use, from everything I've been reading.  Kind of makes me wonder why it's not used a lot more ... having only recently read about it. 




 I just ordered [some](http://www.amazon.com/Diatomaceous-Earth-Food-Grade-10/dp/B00025H2PY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1425267327 sr=8-1 keywords=diatomaceous+earth). I couldn't find any negative accounts with it ... and even the comments   such I *could* find weren't knocking it but more just saying it didn't meet the expectations they'd had ... but most of those even admitted that the bar was pretty high relative to all the positive things they'd read.

I might even try eating some myself ... it doesn't seem to do any harm and who knows *what* it'll drag out of me!  




 The video's where the *real* 'magic' is! 




 anyone have any experience using this? 




 *will* be ... this *will* be so cool :P 




 It also has a *lot* of fluoride. (yes, I'm one of 'those').

 this sounds pointlessly expensive.
 




 /r/Agriculture,
  
  I removed this post. I understand that this could look like some sort of malfeasance or even capitulation towards the (incorrect) statements that /u/JF_Queeny has presented concerning me. This post clearly has nothing to do with the focus of this sub/r and I felt that it not only detracts from the quality that we've all worked over the years to achieve here, but the reduction to name calling and slander is clearly against the T.O.S. of *most* of Reddit in general, as well a reduction to the most petty of behaviors.

  Thankfully throughout the years /r/Agriculture has (almost-) always managed to stay above lesser approaches such as this, and has, in my opinion, proven itself to be one of the highest quality social 'groups' across the *whole* of the internet. With subscribers and active users seemingly wanting to progress the field of agriculture, sharing ideas, expanding knowledge, and helping one another towards whatever goals we may have. 

  I apologize for not acting on this sooner, and I hope that the past 15+ hours that this post stood active before it came to my attention didn't detract from what has otherwise been (and, hopefully, will continue to be) a positive and progressive community.

  It is unfortunate that /u/JF_Queeny has both chosen this course of action, holds these beliefs, as well, has chosen to step down as an acting mod of /r/Agriculture. His contributions have been both beneficial *and* much appreciated throughout his short course here. ..and, as he stated, can be seen continuing over at /r/Farming.

   I, for one, am glad that there are *so* many gardening and agriculture subs on Reddit, each with their own thriving communities. I feel that each has their merits, points of focus, and hope to continue to see Reddit grow and prosper as a community.

  Again, apologies for any detraction or discomfort anyone may feel towards this situation and the already public information it has brought forth, and hope that /r/Agriculture can continue to move forward as the beneficial community I feel it to be.

Sincerely,

  According to studies cited by Seneff, glyphosate engages gut bacteria in a process known as the shikimate pathway. This enables the chemical to interfere with the biochemistry of bacteria in our GI tract, resulting in the depletion of essential amino acids .

Monsanto has maintained that glyphosate is safe for human consumption, as humans do not have the shikimate pathway. Bacteria, however, doesincluding the flora that constitutes gut bacteria.

anyone have any links to the studies 'Seneff' cited?

 yeah, that's what I figured ... it was more just a quirky way to word it 




  SRIs process uses plasma arcs to facilitate reactions between molecules of hydrogen and titanium chloride, a chemical produced from titanium ore. Arcs, like lightning bolts, crack the hydrogen, producing atomic hydrogen that can readily react, says Barbara Heydorn, senior director of the Energy Center at SRI. The reactions produce titanium vapor that quickly solidifies and forms titanium powder.

anyone care to explain what 'atomic hydrogen' is? isn't all hydrogen atomic? even when it's a part of a molecule it's still... an atom... right?

 it's an electric leaf blower. the process takes 3m a day tops. I'm not super concerned about how much power it's using.

whether he wins or not... well... depends on the dem-ticket (I'm more a libertarian.... which, by default, leans me pretty Rand-heavy) ... but, I'm not only *pro* a Ky rep as prez, but also not a big fan of the Bush's ...  ....stale. as. fuck.   .... obvious. as. fuck.  (as to their agenda)

I'd much prefer the 'Paul' agenda (with a history or *returning* funds to the state... posterity or not, it's still a point well made, imo... than a(*nother*) Bush push for a(*nother*) war in the middle east.

but it's of a doctor, just a few years out of medschool, does all the boards, everything.. is a fully licensed, fully insured practicing MD doctor.  Two or three years out (probably early to mid 30's) has aggressively   competitively worked his way up through the hospital to a high paying position...   ..through dedication, discipline, and having no life outside of work   the hospital, has managed to live in a nice but 'quaint-enough' apartment... and paid off *all* of his school loans and such... and even saved away a nice savings.

A few more years... say, '33-35' at this point, and with mounting stress over the frustrations at what he sees as hospital   insurance policy towards less-than-effective treatments towards diseases, becomes ever-increasingly frustrated at the entire medical community and one day just 'snaps'.   Goes home, packs up his minimalist apartment into boxes. Arranges for it to all be moved to storage by the same life-long friend who suggests he take a break and go to an island and drink rum, get drunk, get laid, relax, maybe learn to sail and for god's sake get a tan.... ...at that, Dr 35 jumps on the first plane, flies to some small beautiful but somewhat trendy tropical island in the Caribbean. Meets a girl, takes him to *her* home island... a remote paradise, completely separate from the tourist world... where he learns to sail from her bad ass uncle... while also becoming friends with the local indigenous population... .... when having outgrown his situation and feeling ready to go elsewhere (just like his now-girlfriend/wifey-type outgrew the island and went elsewhere to work)  they make a pact to sail around and take it easy.... 

....then, very '[Hot Pursuit](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093215/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_68)'-like pirates, kidnapping, rescuing, sharks, stingray pets, maybe a jellyfish bite... and, again, pirates... he rescues her and they sail off into the sunset together... turning their backs on the modern medical world, while going from place to place helping the local indigenous populations with practices picked up along the way...  

but, the crazy badass uncle? he teaches the doc how to sail in exchange for the doc healing him of scurvy ... someone somewhere has to have scurvy and be two sheets to the wind-crazy like Robert Loggia's 'Mac' MacClaren character *in* 'Hot Pursuit' .... ... why someone living on a tropical paradise with fresh fruits you could reach up and pluck off the tree and eat immediately anywhere on the island would have scurvy?  I have no idea.. ...maybe a lot at sea or captive situation ... but, the point is... scurvy   a pirate are in there.

 I think the most effective approach to this would be to run a campaign showing how smart pigs are.

If pigs can be presented in such a way that both their intelligence *and* their personalities can be put in front of the public eye on a regular basis... the idea of eating these brilliant creatures (that are also the single largest tapeworm carrier in the average person's diet) would hopefully become as detestable as eating dogs or cats.

Showing pigs as pets is probably an excellent way to start this... if, say, xyz character from Friends or Two and a half men had a (smart, cute, personable) pet pig? If pigs are put out there as *pets* vs livestock... the public may turn against it.

Granted, pigs can go from smart to stupid... and back again... *repeatedly*... ...depending on how they're raised but... that's just another one of the amazing things about these creatures.

 One more thing: Dont buy TransCanadas argument that crude-by-rail disasters demonstrate the need for the Keystone XL pipeline. In fact, the two transport methods have very little to do with each other.

 The vast majority of crude moving by rail in North America is moving east or west from the Bakken shale or other shale sources, says Swift. Thats not the tar sands crude that Keystone XL would have shipped south from Alberta. Keystone XL wouldnt take crude off the rails.

 Depending on the size of the order... but it may make sense to just go directly to the manufacturer.

Either way, you'll want to narrow down the specific seed-products that you want, then from there it shouldn't be *too* difficult.

Location is also a big one... as, again, volume coming into play here, shipping can be a major cost of any large purchase endeavor (or small for that matter!). 

Once you've narrowed down the handful of seed-types that you want, having 2-3 manufacturers of each time should give you something to negotiate off of... and then just contact the manufacturer ... or go to their website and search around until you find local (or local-enough) distributors .. then contact them directly.

again, having a few gives you something to play them off of each other with

  Again, peer reviewed literature would be useful here to support any assertion

[It's technically illegal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_modification#1977_UN_Environmental_Modification_Convention), I highly doubt information like that would be made readily available to the public.

As is, [this (pdf)](http://csat.au.af.mil/2025/volume3/vol3ch15.pdf) is about the best I can provide .. and, since its been about 10 years since I've read it... my memory is *more* than a bit hazy on it.   but, from a military/defense perspective, it makes a *lot* of sense to research the hell out of it ... to at least know what enemies are potentially capable of ... let alone the ability to use it ourselves. I also would imagine that any organization that *is* researching it would want to keep something *that* advanced as quiet as possible .... fore, as the History Channel show you point out is *not* evidence clearly states, the plausible deniability of it *is* what would make it *so* effective. 

...then, professionals such as yourself coming in saying such things are unimaginable adds all the more credit towards a coverup as possible. 

(you should probably check the show out... lightening, cloud seeding, etc is covered in it). 




 I doubt it'll have a problem moving forward. RO tech is advancing pretty quickly... and new [materials](/r/materials) are being worked on that are excellent at filtering water... ....[graphene](/r/graphene) can filter water to ['perfect' purity](http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2014/feb/17/graphene-oxide-makes-perfect-sieve) ... and it's looking like this stuff will be printed like newspapers ... just as fast, just as large a rolls... if not larger.

I read about graphene pretty much daily, I can't really figure out the hangup on why it isn't more available yet... but, the point is... water purification from a materials standpoint is making great strides. From an energy standpoint ... well, obviously that's limited, but with solar being printed like newspaper rolls as well, or at least capable of it... I doubt energy will be that big of a problem moving forward.

Point is, from *that* perspective, there should be plenty of water... affordable water at that.

But, what gets me is the inclusion of Tim Flannery in the article, but the *lack* of mention of [biochar](/r/biochar) in the article. I was under the impression that Australia (in general... though, more NSW specifically) was one of the most progressive places in the *world* actively utilizing   incorporating biochar into the soils.  I'm really surprised that that hasn't carried west and been more of a 'hit' in Perth... ....it'd definitely go a long way towards both building soils as well limiting water requirements for the area.

(Tim Flannery is *well* aware the [potential of biochar](http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2008/s2611906.htm) .. (search: 'char' ... he calls it 'charcoal' but same difference, it's introduced in the interview *as* 'biochar') 




 There are other documentaries related to weather manipulation.

In those documentaries there are scientists that *also* 'study these sorts of things for a living' ... and, in their cases, *specifically* study the systems   approaches being utilized. As such, many of their testimonies or accounts would beg to differ.

I read a lot of medical-related things. One of the things I come across quite often is where a general doctor (be it M.D., PhD, or just someone labeled as 'doctor' in a generic sense from Newark's College of Medicine   Taxi Driving') that will completely contradict what other MD's, PhD's and just hardened researchers will specifically focus on. Talk to the researchers, you quickly realize that they have a rich understanding about the topic being discussed, talk to the 'general doctor' and ask them the same questions and they either respond with the more 'general line of thought'... aka, the 'popular opinion' or 'what they were taught' ... or simply don't respond at all.

The contradiction is what's funny to me. 

I ultimately don't have a clue what's going on... I've read many places that the energy equivalent of even a simple jetstream is orders of magnitude higher on a daily/hourly/minutely/consistent basis than all the nuclear weapons we've ever created.   At the same time, influencing, manipulating, or slightly adjusting something requires a lot less energy than containing it altogether ... ...and, as such, can still have a cumulative toll down the line.

Anyone who's ever stuck their hand out the window of even a slower moving car and 'ridden the wind' can attest to the idea that a slight move of the hand, bringing resistance to the wind, can drastically alter the placement of your hand, wrist, arm, and focus very quickly afterwards.

Maybe 'slight adjustments' are all that are needed to make a system bring on dramatically different results?

Unless your focus is specifically on systems of this nature... and, by 'systems' I mean ionospheric heaters and technologies of that sort... not to dismiss your experience   expertise but... in the relatively-random environment of reddit ...where 'streed cred' is a bit harder to verify, [links](http://weatherwarfare.worldatwar.info/2013/11/can-facilities-like-haarp-be-used-to-manipulate-the-weather/) help provide support to statements, claims, and positions. 




 It's from 2008 I believe. ... so the tech has advanced considerably since then from my understanding.

At that, 2008 was well into the transition from what the HC used to be to what H has since become ... ....but, 'That's Impossible' is one of the last (and, arguably, *best*) good series of the 'old HC' that used to (relatively) rock.

It's a good show. I make it a point to watch every time the weather gets a little wacky ... ...like, beyond normal 'it's cold because its winter' wacky.   ...just as a sort of refresher/reminder that things within the realms of being controlled, but still beyond my control are going on.

  Some temporary fixes can be made but before long the plants will have to be decommissioned.

hopefully sooner than later. Not saying another Chernobyl-like event is really a concern I lose sleep over with them... ...I'd *imagine* they're pretty heavily monitored at this point, as well, relative safety precautions have been put in place drastically limiting the likelihood of a repeat incident. 

...at the same time, the overall design itself just seems... ...'Yugo-quality'.

 Ultimately? no. not really.

but, then again? yes. absolutely.

do i think you'd really learn any new 'data'? no. and, anything like that is better learned in a book or online or something ... ...what individual or collective teacher/s can dump an encyclopedia of information... period. ... let alone in a singular season?

it's impossible... ...and, ultimately, unnecessary to look at it that way. 

what *would* be learned is... ....there's a big difference between *reading* about holes being dug... or, more, things going in them .. ..and, getting out and digging holes.

it's the 'hands-on' experience of it.   ... the 'immersion' of sort of it.

the rest? read some (more) books! :)

i think the idea though is that you'd be able to get your hands dirty with it for a bit. I'm sure there may be better ways to do it than a PDC ... maybe other 'groups' available around where you live .. ..but, PDCs are just the first that come to mind, of course. 




 I think you pretty much hit most of the problems right on their head...

those that have the money/resources don't know, and those that know don't have the money/resources. ... or don't care. ... nor do they really *have* to, unfortunately.

Going to bullet point 1... I'd imagine that it'd prob be better to work for someone else for a bit than try it on your own. Maybe get some experience with people   places that're already doing it .. ..then branching out from there?  ... vs trying to tackle it on your own right from the start. That sounds like a surefire way to find yourself stuck in a really troublesome and demoralizing situation ... really fast.

maybe work with some of the permacultural groups or do a PDC this summer or something? 




 Sounds like an awesome non-profit! ... and you definitely seem to have great ideas towards it...

The point of my snarkiness is... you'd be better using a [Kill-a-Watt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_A_Watt) to get a measurement on your power usage ... I'd average it out over something like 30 days.  

Just plug the same devices you plan on having in your cabin into a power strip that is, in turn, plugged into the Kill-a-watt and take your measurements at regular intervals to get an idea of your average usage.

From *there* you can start to design your system.

But, as others have said here... well, two things 1) H.Freight makes crap quality ... ...and I *really* wouldn't want it coming down to a h.freight--quality product. Not that you can't always swap it out with a higher quality one once you get the money or narrow things down ... ..you'll obv be saving a *lot* living off grid like that ... ... but, some things are worth spending a little more up front on.

2) batteries. Solar panels are awesome, but they're only as good as the batteries storing their juice.

You'd be best getting a system that allows for *multiple* inputs ... that way if you add more panels, wind, etc... you can plug them in... but still comes back to the batteries being charged.

Also, a generator. Obviously you won't want to use it often... it kind of defeats your purpose ... but, you can (most likely) find a great quality generator on c.list ... something that runs both 120 *and* 240v is my recommendation ... you never know when you'll want to weld or power something a 120v alone isn't going to be able to ... I have both, and they're both heavy... at that, I find myself throwing my 240v into my truck more often than my 120 just 'cause... well, they're both heavy ... ..and, being stuck out w/ just the 120v and unexpectedly needing the extra power, the longer run, or the higher voltage just isn't worth the trek back when throwing the 240v in in the first place would've done it.

240v's also tend to have more power than 120's alone... though I've seen plenty of just-120's with way more power output than some 240v's i've seen.

either way, the point is, a generator is a great thing to have... and the ability to have both it *and* solar charging your cells at the same time is going to be all the nicer. ...albeit, costlier too.

a nice inverter run directly off the battery/alternator is nice to have too... ..again, power distance becomes an issue .. ...if your cabin is in the woods, far from where you park .. ...but, I can power my [13 amp chainsaw](http://www.lowes.com/pd_36_0__?productId=3009620) off of my truck alone... as well my 120v generator ... and make quick work of branches, small trees, and brush w/out having to pull out my Stihl. 

...which leads me to... ....you can also get into [pyrolytic](/r/pyrolysis) [gasification](/r/gasification) of [biomass](/r/biomass) whereby you feed the [syngas](/r/syngas) into your generator and... well... being a cabin, you'll have plenty of branches or brush I'd imagine ... ....and you can just use *that* to charge your batteries for a peaceful night's sleep.

but, as great as H.Freight stuff is... I'd really opt for some higher quality products .. ...esp if its going to be your sole system that you're dependent on  .... w/*out* other back up sources of energy

edit: [or tis one](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834314777 cm_re=acer_aspire_switch-_-34-314-777-_-Product) ... I own both. I know this is /r/android much, if forced to choose, I'd take the Acer Aspire Switch any day of the week and twice on Sunday.   ...but, both have their strengths   weaknesses ... mainly the OS. Android is just better as a 'tablet-tablet' than Metro is... but, then, I never use the Switch as a Metro-type tablet .. and though the versatility of Windows 8.1 allows android to run inside of it isn't something I've messed with, it allows for it... which may account for something if I ever got around to trying it out on it 




 the video at the bottom is fun! 




  Though I wish the writer had remarked the importance of doing this only if you plant native milkweed species since otherwise you could be causing more harm than goo

 seems great! ... [biochar](/r/biochar) seems like it may be faster and scale a bit better ... but, there's no reason the two couldn't function symbiotically together... reinforcing one another even

 Wood chips are fantastic! 

While driving down the road, just grab the number off the side of a truck (or google their business name if their number isn't there) that you see loaded down with wood chips. I've never met a single one who *won't* deliver for free when they're in the area.

Where I live, they're required to dump in yard debris dumps (at a fee) or have to drive out to surrounding counties (traffic, time, energy, distance, etc) to dump on someone's farm... ...so they're almost *always* glad to deliver for you.  .... though they don't like to drive off the driveway (understandably) so if they dump them on your driveway, lay down a tarp or two  (the more layers of tarp, the less likely it is to tear when dragging it... Harbor Freight has coupons for free tarps *all* the time... and I've never had a problem with tearing when I triple-layered up)

um... but, yeah, awesome stuff!

The crews around here will usually use two different teeth-types for their chippers.... ... one that does chips, and one that does shreds.  

The shreds breakdown a *lot* faster... have a *lot* more 'green' (aka: nitrogen) in them, and are better for composting with.

The chips (usually hockey puck or fist sized) are from the trunk and larger branches... *excellent* sources of carbon... .... but they take longer to breakdown.

If you can build enough of a relationship with a grew... or just pay them (they'd be getting *paid* for something they usually have to *pay* to dump so... $10-20 is usually more than enough) ... they'll separate the loads for you... ...esp if you're close enough to the job they're working on.

At that, the chips make excellent mulch for walkways and such... ...but you'll need to add a *lot* of green to them to get them to breakdown in a timely manner. 

You can spray them with compost teas, that definitely seems to help... if you brew any, just spray any excess over the piles .... works great for speeding up [composting](/r/composting) anyway..

...or, if they've separated them for you, or dumped them at separate times... just be sure to mix a higher ratio of shreds to chips ... so the nitrogen will aid the breakdown.

If you're feeling *really* adventurous... but a bottle of SumaGrow (shelf stable for I believe 5 years.. so a gallon will last you for multiple seasons) ... and use a little bit to breed it out (compost tea-style) and spray them with it... .... add in some extra sugar (or molasses) to the water at the last minute so they'll have something to eat once the get on the woodchips (literally just using warm water (not tap! has chlorine!) and mixing organic sugar into it in a separate sprayer works... and apply before/after/during)... ... either way, the diazatrophs in the SumaGrow will breed out, fixing nitrogen, and helping to accelerate the breakdown all the faster.

Awesome stuff... tons of nutrients... and multiple purposes.   excellent source of carbon.

on the black walnut? ... [juglone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juglone) is the chemical they're looking for... ... diluted down it isn't a huge problem... but maybe use the black walnut to make [biochar](/r/biochar) out of instead?

 Not sure which it is.

I've definitely had moments of waiting (too many tabs open, so it's my fault...I know better) where I've thought about removing the chip that's there and soldering on a 4gb one in its place. :)

edit: I'd typed $250 in my first post... I actually paid $225  (I hunted   waited that bitch down like a fucking pro for it to drop below $250 refurb'd.... free s h too!)     [NewEgg's now selling it for $200](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834314777 cm_re=acer_aspire_switch-_-34-314-777-_-Product)

...which puts it in price with the OP's price-paid.  being said... .. I'd buy the thing again   again.

Of course I have a few 'things' I'd prefer be different about it, but for $225?? or $200?  ...I like it a *lot* better than the Asus equivalent (which I was looking at beforehand ... and my laptop is an Asus ... as well my Android tablet.. and most of the components of both of my desktops)

it's better than the Asus in formfactor though... and price... and battery life..     the screen flips... i mean, its detachable but you can reattach it 'backwards' and fold it down so that the screen faces up... in the same direction as the keyboard .... ...well, like the pic in the link above.  or just use it detached from the keyboard altogether.


My 'complaints' about it ... .... I really really like windows 8.1.  Of course I tweak the everliving shit out of it... mainly using Classic Shell ... and have it set up so that I never *have* to use Metro... and rarely do even by choice.   ... unless really really bored and don't have wifi so I'm kinda just killing time.

The 'complaints' 

1) the ram ... 4gb would just be much awesomer ... the ability to upgrade to 4gb would be totally sufficient... esp for the price. it doesn't have to come with 4gb... but to have it configured in such a way that it could be increased...

2) if the USB port were 3.0 in such that I could use a usb key to increase the ram-ability of it. I've never done that whole use a usb-key as ram before but I've heard/read good things and... would possibly suffice *not* having 4gb of ram

3) the screen's capacitive touch is really really nice. I really have no complaints... .... again, I use it in desktop mode, not metro... so any quarks are probably relative to that but... there's something about how it reacts that's different than, say, my Asus tablet or HTC M8/LG G3 phone's screen.  but, again, probably a windows thing and possibly something that windows 10 will improve upon.  ....not an issue one way or the other, more just a 'quark'

4) I'd *really* like if the keyboard base had the ability to put a battery in it.  As is, the keyboard is totally *not* necessary for function... charging, etc. I oftentimes use a full sized keyboard with it ... if i'm sitting at a desk ... despite that the keyboard is surprisingly nice... esp for one so small.

but, if the keyboard has the ability to slide in an extra battery... as well, that extra battery to charge the device... as well, be able to *be* charged independent of the device ... in such that I could keep it charging ... carry the screen around... and then plug the screen-keyboard together to charge the screen... as well to give juice to the screen... both, at the same time. ...that'd be nice. I'd pay extra for that.

I feel like there's another thing that I'm forgetting but... *that* I'm forgetting it means that it's not only not really a big problem... but is an even *smaller* problem than the already mentioned small problems above.

the ram is the main issue.  and it isn't even an issue, I just have to remember to keep my tabs at around 10 or less.   ...and I use OneTab for chrome so that makes it pretty easy ... as well as the 'get pocket' extension ... so, moving tabs from various computers/devices ... as well collapsing open tabs into a onetab tab if it gets slow is only a problem if I have something I'm working on in an open tab... say a reddit comment that *won't* back up... and then I just need to move that tab around so that it doesn't collapse into the OneTab consolidation.

With that... for $200? fuck yeah. If it had android it'd be all the cooler... but, only in a dual-boot configuration. ..

...oh! the speakers!  It has *better* speakers than my LG G3 (paltry) but *not* as good (nor as loud) as my HTC M8 ... ...that's second to the ram. They're not bad, they're just quiet   it has bluetooth 4.0 though so that and/or just normal headphones let me get past it but it'd be nice if they'd increased the volume on that a bit.

apologies for the full review of it. just really a big fan of the thing.. esp now that it's $200 




 I bought a refurb'd Acer Switch 10 for $250 off of newegg about six months ago... I haven't had a problem, and for a tabletop convertible deal, I love it.

Would buy another in a heartbeat ...and without a second thought if anything happened to it.

It's only real limitation is the 2gb of ram. 4gb's would've been nicer, or at least the ability to swap the 2gb chip out for a 4.

It isn't android...but I like that it has Windows on it. If I could dual-boot I'd set it up, but I imagine I'd rarely use the android boot just because it's a full version of Windows (i detest metro and never use it).
