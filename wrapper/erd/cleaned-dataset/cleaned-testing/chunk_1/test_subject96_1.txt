 I watched Sunset Blvd for the first time a few months back and it didn't really do much for me. Maybe it's because I've seen bits and pieces of it used and parodied over the years, but it seemed mostly silly and hokey and old fashioned.

I watched Double Indemnity after that and I was like, "Holy shit, why did nobody ever tell me this movie is so good?". That whole film is so good from beginning to end and it seems much more modern, if you can say that about movie made when Hitler was still a going concern. 




 The show has been in repeats for a couple years now, but this is still very sad news. 

Nothing like driving around on the weekend, running errands and listening to the Tom and Ray yak it up on the radio. He will be missed. 




 I think Will will eventually out himself, maybe after another suicide attempt.

 For me, Cloud Atlas was a movie that tried too hard to be clever and ended up being much more clever than good. 

For example, the idea of having actors portray several different characters in the movie, some of different age gender, race, age, etc probably seemed really cool on paper, but I found it distracting and often silly. A lot of times when the film moved to a different time period I'd spend a good amount of time trying to figure out who was who and what that meant. When your effects and makeup get in the way of your story, you've made the wrong choice.

Which is really kind of sad because I did like a lot of it. I found parts of the stories very compelling and a lot of visuals were interesting, but in the end the whole thing just didn't hang together for me. 




 Dude, seriously? You're working fifteen hours a week and your boss thinks it's some kind of long-term career for you? How could anybody expect anyone to live on that?

Get a solid start date from your new job and two weeks before that walk into your boss's office and tell her you're giving your two weeks notice. Thank her for the opportunity and ask her what things she'd like to finish up/document before you go.

If she gives you trouble, just tell her how sorry you are but the position offers more money and the opportunity to transition to a field you're more interested in. You can also offer to take on freelance work if they're stuck, especially since the new job isn't F/T. Just remember that your freelance rate should be at least double your W-2 hourly rate.

Lastly, don't worry so much about what other people do can do or can't do or make or whatever. Focus on yourself and what you can do and what the value of that work is.

Good luck! 




 Yeah, maybe part of my problem with the movie is that the trailer raised the bar so much and the film just didn't deliver.  




 The Papa Johns one was the worst. The others (Cinnabon, eHarmony, etc.) passed mostly under my notice, but the Papa Johns really pulled me out of the film. 




 I hope this is not too basic a question, but does anyone have any simple tips for taking pictures of merchandise for sale online?

I have a client that own an antique lighting store. He has hundreds, maybe thousands of items in inventory: chandeliers, floor lamps, table lamps, etc. He wants to take pictures of a lot of his stock to put on the new website that I'm building for him. 

I've done a lot of searching online, but nothing I've found really seems to address this specific thing.  




 The thing is this. Wind turbines kill about 500,000 birds a year. Cats kill one to four BILLION birds a year. If the people complaining about this were truly concerned about bird deaths, instead of looking for a reason to criticize wind power, they'd be pushing to ban or at  least restrict the cat population.

Also, wind power is about 4% of US energy production. If we built enough wind turbines to power the whole country and the bird death rate per kwh remained roughly the same, wind turbines would be killing around twelve million birds a year, still less than ten percent of the number of birds that die from just flying into buildings. 




 Yeah, this. 

I got two TouchPad's during their $99 fire sale. I used the native WebOS for a while. It was slick. Better than Android in a lot of ways. But eventually not having any apps made it less and less useful.

I eventually installed CyanogenMod on both of them.  




 I imagined the title of this thread being read Werner Herzog's voice and it was glorious. 




 I wouldn't feel all that broken up or morally conflicted about taking the better offer. 

The smaller firm obviously thought they could hire a new employee at well below market rate if they put in an offer very early on in the process. It's a negotiating ploy. You don't have to fall for it.

FYI, $6.00 an hour is roughly $12,500 a year if you work a 40 hour week. That's a huge sum of money and something that will likely influence your earning power for the rest of your life.

Take the better offer and don't look back. 

 




 The Last Starfighter is still one of my personal faves from the 80's. How can you beat the great Robert Preston as a interstellar con-man/recruiter?

It's a decent film, although it's hampered by a muddled third act and some pretty unimpressive villains.  




 6/21/04 for me. 26,351 e-mails in my account. 




 Borat. I find the whole concept of the film, tricking average, everyday people into looking stupid or foolish or racist or whatever so that other people can laugh at them to be morally reprehensible.  




 I can't speak to your specific experience, but if you feel you've been misclassified as a 1099 worker, then there are steps you can take.

http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-should-you-do-if-youve-been-misclassified-independent-contractor.html

The IRS does often bring the hammer down on companies that improperly classify their workers as independent contractors. 




 Thanks, Remo! Went to bed and woke up with a pile of donuts and other goodies. 

You're the best! 




 You can't just declare employees independent contractors to get around minimum wage laws. The IRS has [fairly strict rules](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses- -Self-Employed/Independent-Contractor-Self-Employed-or-Employee) about this and they're more than happy to rain fire and death on you if you try to play cute with them.

 




 "You'll get over it"

Said to my Dad by my Mom when he was trying to get back together with her after leaving for the third or fourth time. 




 Nothing that you would find very interesting, most likely. At that stage, the only real differences you would find would be typos, misspellings, grammar, punctuation and maybe some word usage. 




 A DAW editor gave it to me back when the book first came out. 




 I do web sites for small, local businesses. An issue I've been running into more and more is that the business will have a Google Places listing that was set up for their business by someone else some time ago. They have no control of it and have no idea who might. 

Right now I have three clients who are in this situation, a small HVAC contractor, a pizza place and a lighting shop. The pizza place is really in bad straights because the Google listing points to a domain that is now owned by a domain squatter.

I have submitted the recovery form and then followed up with an e-mail, but no luck so far.

Any help or directions would be appreciated. 




 So I'm decluttering and getting rid of a bunch of old stuff I don't want anymore. I have the original bound galley of Name Of The Wind with the note from Betsy Wollheim  on the cover. 

I know that this was considered quite the collectible at one time, but I can't find any listings for it online. 




 Where would I find that phone number? 




 The show been soapy for a while now. I'm just waiting for someone's evil twin to show up during sweeps week. 




 On a related note, has anyone had luck recovering a Google Places/Google Plus listing for one of their clients. I do mostly small, local businesses and it seems like a lot of them have a listing that was set up by someone else and they have no idea who it was or how to get control of it. 




 Women received over 57% of the bachelor degrees awarded in the USA in 2012. Can someone explain why there should be general, women-only scholarship funds at all? 




 The crickets in the comedy club audience made me laugh. 




 Here's some pictures that I took this morning. Thanks for your help.

 I live in a 60 year old house in Long Island, New York. It's a two story house, 1400 sq ft house with a single zone and 13 cast-iron radiators for hot water heat.

When we bought the house in 2010, one of the first things I had done was to replace the old, oil-fired burner and cheap , gas hot water heater with a new Burnham Alpine Condensing Boiler and a Buderus S120w indirect hot water heater.

Now when the system works, it's great. The house stays nice and warm in the winter and my gas bills are low.

The problem is that during the transition from heating season to non-heating season and also from summer into heating season, I get a lot of air in the hot water system. The system gets air bound and I have to turn the system off, close a valve and open the water spigot and let water run through a hose into a bucket until all the air is out.

This obviously creates several problems. One, I have no hot water. Two, the circulator runs and runs until I fix it, which can't be good for it and third, when It's cold out I have no heat because the burner is programmed to heat the hot water before it heats the house.

The guys who installed the system don't seem to have a good solution for me. The added an air eliminator right above the hot water circulator, but that didn't seem to help.

The system was fine all summer, but then it got a bit chilly, the heat kicked on and now I'm down in the basement bleeding the system on a daily basis.

Today I tried running the heat and then opening the bleeder valves on the radiators to try and clean out some of the air. No joy there. The problem remains.

If anyone has any idea of how to either

1)    Keep the air from getting into my system or
2)    Have it be automatically eliminated or other wise dealt with

I'd appreciate it 




 There's no requirement under the FLSA to pay you extra money for working a holiday, so, by that metric, you were paid 7 hours at your OT rate, whether they call it holiday or OT is probably not relevant.

Although I can say that when I get extra pay for working a holiday, I also get OT if I go over 40 hours a week, holiday hours included. 

You might want to look at your company handbook and see what it says on this subject. 




 I doubt that FX is going to cancel it, given all the positive buzz it's been getting. It used to be that all that mattered were ratings, but I think positive critical acclaim has a lot of value these days and I can't see a cable channel like FX ditching a show that everyone is writing about.

I loved Legit, but pretty much nobody wrote about that show or even mentioned it, especially during its second season where it may well have been in witness protection. 




 The bad guy is kinda meh and that hurts the movie quite a bit, I think.

When your big bad is a sleazy defense contractor whose evil plan is to just continue ripping off Uncle Sugar by making defective/substandard weapons, it takes some of the juice out of it.

Otherwise it's a fun flick. The Remo/Chiun stuff is great. I loved Kate Mulgrew's snarky femism. 

It's interesting also as an example of how movies have changed. There's not much in the way of a big action setpiece. And there's no way they'd cast a white actor as Chiun in 2014. 




 The comments on that page are priceless. 









 I did work for ZapMyTax.com and I also used them to file a grievance.

My taxes didn't go down, though.  




 It's like what Michael Mckean has said about Spinal Tap in concert, "We pretend to be a rock 'n' roll band, and they pretend to be our fans," 




 Wrong. You are never allowed to make employees work before punching in. Never.

If they show up early and you're swamped, have them punch in early. If business rules prohibit this, then they can not work.

All hours worked by an hourly employee must be be paid. 




 I wish I could upvote this comment a zillion times 




 I have the same issue on my Galaxy S2. I have a ton elixir to spend now too. 




 Yeah, the game kept crashing on me this morning and now I can't get to the game at all. It keeps bombing out. 




 The thing about Babylon 5 is that the idea of it was just so much greater than its execution.

J. Michael Straczynski (the show runner/creator) promised a strongly serialized show with a predefined, complex, multi-season story arc about war and politics between multiple, star-spanning empires.  There show would have compelling personal drama and an emphasis on hard, science-based SF.

What we got was, more often than not, a muddled mess with terrible dialogue, lazy plotting, poor acting, cheap-looking sets and a giant helping of sledgehammer o' message on a regular basis.

One thing people may not know is that not only did Straczynski create and run the show, he wrote 92 of the 110 episodes of the show.Apparently, even the 18 episodes that were done by other writers were extensively re-written by him. There's a good reason why that kind of thing isn't done.  Nobody can  produce content at that rate (and run the show too) and maintain any kind of quality.  

There's a great quote from, often attributed to Mark Twain but actually penned by Edgar Wilson Nye, "Wagner's music is better than it sounds". 

This kind of sums up my opinion of B5. When I watched the show back in the day, I was often unhappy with what wss on the screen, but there were hints and shadows of great things just around the corner. There was, I think, a much better show hidden inside, but Stracznski's limitations and his control freak nature basically smothered it.

What's interesting, looking back, is that B5 was in many ways a prototype for modern, serialized, mystery-driven, genre TV shows like Lost, Battlestar Galactica, etc. 




 Even with an epidural, jiggling your diaphragm with your uterus cut open can be pretty painful. 




 Hodor? 




 My wife had a c-section, so she couldn't see the baby right away.

"Hey, she looks like your dad."

"Really?"

"Yup, bald and angry"

Pro-tip, don't make your wife laugh when she's just had a c-section. 




 It's kinda cool, but what would you use it for?  




 It's important to understand that employers are liable for all hours worked or suffered to be worked by all their employees. If you worked overtime, even if it of your own volition without any direction from your manager, you have every right to put it on your time card and the company must pay you for it.

I'm not sure how long ago this was, but the company owes you this money and you can file a complaint or file suit to recover it. 




 I've been on Ting for just over a year now. The Missus and I both have Galaxy S2's that I scored on eBay.

My wife's major issue with the S2 is the camera. Her friend showed her  all the great pics she took with her S5 and there was much envy. I can't really swing $600 for a new S5 now, so I'm looking for an alternative that might serve. 




 Did you watch the video? Obviously you can only afford this if you already have a BMW. 




 My dad always had dreams of being a Jewish cowboy. 

When I was growing up, my house had tons of western memorabilia.  









 I really should know better than to read the comments at espn.com. 




 While I'm not particularly interested in taking sides in a squabble between Katy Perry or Rhianna and the NFL, it's hard to overstate how tone deaf this is.  

You have some of the biggest, most popular acts in the world and the NFL is not only asking them to play for free, but to actually pay for the privilege like they were some garage band at a bringer show. 
 




 Seriously. Why not just auction it off to the highest bidder? 

That could end up being a lot of fun. 









 The key with using CraigsList is persistence. You have to look every day or even several times a day and then jump on things when they pop up. Don't dither or fart around.

I got almost all my home gym stuff on CL. 500 pounds of Olympic Plates, rack, bench, treadmill, elliptical, dumbells, floor mats, etc. The only things I've bought new are an incline bench for situps and some smaller plates to round out my collection. 

Pro-tip, you can set up RSS feeds of specific searches and view them in your favorite feed reader. No need to even visit the site. 



















 I have one. I've been using it since I joined Ting a year ago. 

I like it fine. I play some games on it and watch movies (Netflix/HBOGO) and it works OK. It's gotten a little wonky of late and I think it needs a factory reset.

I've been thinking of getting an S3, but honestly I prefer the S2's smaller size.  









 On the one hand, that's horrible and disgusting, but on the other hand...you do have to admire their dedication. 














 Um...isn't it obvious?

 I have a Sprint-branded Galaxy S2 that I bought on eBay and brought to Ting. Lately it's been acting up and I'm thinking I'll reset it to factory before considering a new phone.

If I do this, is there something I have to do to make it work with Ting? I remember entering some codes that Ting sent me when I first acquired it. Do I have to do that again? 




 Umm...it's like...a joke. 




 It's not like he's working much since they wrapped production on Serial Apeist 2 









 He was out. 




 Thanks, man! 

I just know, deep in my heart, that if I'm not being charged a convenience fee, I must somehow be being inconvenienced. 




 I bought two S2s off of eBay last year to use on Ting. Pretty good deal and no problems so far. 




 So, I've been on Ting now since August of 2013. Before Ting I had VZ and I was paying over $160 a month for me and the missus, with a preferred employer "discount".

I don't make a lot of phone calls. I rarely text and I almost always use my phone somewhere where there's WiFi.  So I was a little shocked the first time I got a bill from Ting.

Twenty six bucks and change.

Not twenty six bucks per phone. Twenty six bucks total for two phones. That's...kinda crazy, isn't it. 

I almost want to call them up and say, "Are you sure that's enough? I can pay a little more if you guys are strapped." 




 Still no actual trailer for Tyrant? Seriously, this thing starts in just over a month. Shouldn't they have some actual footage from the show to show us by now? 




 [Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band](http://www.feelnumb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/The_Beatles_Sgt_Peppers_lonely_hearts_club_band_hi_res.jpg)

Now I really feel old. 




 http://www.wpthemedetector.com/ works pretty well, I've found. But, as noted above, this site is not a WordPress site. 




 Seriously? How many options do you think the average person has for internet access? Most people have one good option and maybe one or two more increasingly crappy ones. 

I myself have Optimum Cable Internet. If I wanted to switch away from that, my only option is a craptastic DSL line. A lot of people don't even have that.

How can you have competition without any competitors? Do you think, in the absence of government regulation, companies will spring up to run fiber to my house so that they can go head to head with my cable company? They'd be better off piling their money in the middle of the floor and lighting it on fire. 




 Looks nice. 

Could it be easily modified to work booking appointments in a nail/hair salon? 




 The real key to this is not that the sequel was so, over the top, bad. I mean, it wasn't good, but there are certainly worse sequels. 

The key bit is that ads for the sequel started SIX WEEKS after the original movie hit the theaters. The sequel itself was out just a few months after that. B2:EBOO represents the epitome of a sequel for sequel's sake.  




 I've used this in the past and it works pretty well for what you want

http://wordpress.org/plugins/catablog/

It requires a reasonable amount of work to bang it into shape, though. 




 Job Manager. 

The last site I did for, which was not a WordPress site, him had a nice, job board feature that I custom wrote in PHP/MySQL. I figured I'd save a little time this time around and use a pre-existing plugin.  




 Long story short, I created a site for a client last year using a free plugin from wordpress.org/plugins. I evaluated a bunch of premium plugins, but the free one was clearly the best for my needs.

After setting it up and turning it live, I noticed that there was one bit that wasn't working correctly. Going back to the support forum, I then read that author had moved on to other projects. Now I'm concerned that some future WP upgrade will just break it completely and my client will be unhappy (to say the least).

Has this happened to you and what have you done about it? I could maybe switch to another plugin, but it would require a fair amount of work setting it up, work that I might not be able to bill for. 

I've also considered trying to fork the project myself. I've never written a WP plugin, but I've done a lot of PHP work over the years and I figure I'd be up for it. Has anyone else done this?
This is a fairly complex plugin 




 WP-Client looks like a useful bit of software, but I don't think I can give money to any company that autoplays a video with audio right on its front page.
