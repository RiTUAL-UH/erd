 Metamucil FTW! 




 more beanz! 




 1 thing I don't see mentioned about 4HB is how cutting out dairy has affected people...for me it was a life-changer.  I've been a huge milk drinker all my life but also suffered from gross psoriasis on my scalp, elbows, and knees.  I'd say within a month of starting 4HB, I was completely psoriasis free.  All those years that docs had me on creams, steroids, lotions, whatever....crazy. 




 if 2 glasses of red wine per night is ok - I'm calling 2 beers a night ok too... 









 Amazing. 




 SKYDART FTW!!

You had me at "oh my Cthulhu" 




 oh stop it.

 FTW - Fuck The World! 




 I made a girl vomit w/ a fart once. 









 Man, I never talk about it....when my daughter was 2, I was out front flipping my 800lb strongman tire in front of the garage.  I had been drinking w/ friends and was showing off.  I was just finishing a flip whe I saw my daughter out of the corner of my eye run right under the tire just a fraction of a second before it smacked down on the concrete.  She would have been crushed to death.  That was 8 years ago. 



















 Vermiculite. 




 Slater's 









 I'd say 700-800lbs 




 awesome! 




 totally. 




 yeah, strongman or powerlifting, but folks here seem to enjoy the pics...and really it's for anyone wanting to get stronger.  Thanks for posting Kenny! 




 NorCal here. 




 Yes, unloaded w/ just the tires it's only around 150 lbs. 




 The Log 




 Where you at? 




 48" stone platform....will now be 48" stone coffin- thanks! 




 we call it the ugly yoke....great for yoke presses and awkward yoke runs... 




 awesome man thanks! 




 most stones you see here were inherited from past competitions, but we've made many ourselves using Slater's stone molds...

then just buy your concrete and get after it! 




 a lot of technique involved in stone lifting. 




 looks awesome! practice those events - 700lb yoke for 75ft sounds BRUTAL!! 




 like anything else, just watch your form and listen to your body! 




 awesome!  Shouldering a 235lb stone is no joke! 




 a friend bought it from an old Navy guy - they were piled up in his front yard. 




 I started w/ a tire - any place that has big tires will be happy to get rid of one.  Then take it home...and flip it. 




 330 stone...

the grass gets mowed w/ stones, sleds, chains, and tires... 




 Thanks 




 thanks...yup, me a couple of years back 




 Some of my equip there but mostly a friend of mine...I have many bodybuilder friends come out to The Field for a day of training.  It's always good to switch things up...whatever your goals are. A 180lb stone would be awesome...it's hard to train for much volume w/ a 300+ lb stone.  




 Thanks man! 




 I was thinking the same...give me 10 years or so.  He's already the biggest 1st grader around. 




 You'd be surprised, not everyone in strongman...is strong.  You can still train light.   




 Thanks! 




 700lb drag...

 Atlas stones from 250 - 400lbs...I think my son is on the 360 there...
