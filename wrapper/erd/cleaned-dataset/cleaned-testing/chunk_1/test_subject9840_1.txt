 Air conditioning. Why is it so noisy and never the right temperature?! 




 I have a laptop with a 10" screen. You can make it full screen and I can read those on the train, but I generally don't like reading off a screen if it's more than 10 pages. 

Also I hate reading off my laptop in bed. I will usually print it off or buy it cause the laptop gets hot.  




 Did you get it? 




 I've got it. I'll email it through. 




 Haha wow how do they enforce that?  




 Yeah fair enough. I was thinking more of publicly available statistics, but of course the insurance companies would record those.  




 I don't think anyone actually records those types of statistics. 

Also, I was providing statistics relevant to car insurance, so I think this is relevant for that purpose.

I am not really saying women are better drivers than men, only that they are involved in different types of accidents. 




 Some stats from my state ([link](http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/downloads/accidentstats2007.pdf)):

* 2007: "More than a quarter of all speeding drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were males aged 17-25. In contrast, only four per cent of speeding drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were females in that age group."

* 2007: "Fatigue was assessed as being involved in at least 20% of fatal crashes. Thirty-one per cent of the fatigued drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were males aged 40 years or more."

* 2006: 374 male road deaths vs 122 female road deaths 


Women and men may have the same number of accidents overall, but women may have more smaller prangs than men but fewer big accidents - so claims cost less ([link](http://www.carinsuranceexplained.com/car_insurance_explained/men_vs_women.htm)).

 




 I agree with this. As much as people pretend like they are okay with a mental illness, they can't shake their misconceptions. 

A girl where I work told some people she had suffered from severe depression and was on anti-depressants, and I heard hush hush comments from people about it, saying things about how she wasn't stable. It was not done in a nasty tone at all, in fact more of a caring tone, but I still feel she is treated differently to other people. She is very capable of doing the job she was hired to do, and I don't think this should be on people's minds when it comes to her work.

 Computer Science! 

I started out in pure science and ended up veering towards Comp Sci.

I know a lot of people who've done IT and a lot of them have ended up working at banks and consulting, but a few are doing different things. 

Downside is that I graduated in a downturn period. Was really hard to find my first job. I went back to uni and studied more and when I came out again it was great! 

I also like how what I can do can be applied to a lot of different industries. As someone with a short attention span for one particular topic, this is important to me.

What I don't like is that IT is often perceived by business as a service, because in most cases that's precisely what it is. 

I love that I am in IT, and wouldn't do anything else given the choice again now. Now it's just a matter of finding a job I like too :)

 Night and Daycare 




 That describes my organisation exactly! I am going a little bit insane here. I don't think I will hang around for much longer in all honesty, but I hope to do something good while I am here.

I like your advice, and I will keep trying to focus on constructively moving things forward. I guess sometimes I have been a little impatient, and don't always understand management's decisions. I will follow your advice though and listen to my manager and other people who have been around the organisation.

Unfortunately, most of my peers aren't much help. I have asked them and a lot of them seem to have given up on improving the organisation as it has proven to be too hard, and just focus on their technical work and the other job benefits, like the paycheck and leave. I've become rather de-motivated lately, as my peers tell me to enjoy the pay/leave benefits and not to worry about the problems of the business. At this stage in my career I am not yet prepared to do that though, and I am hoping this becomes a valuable learning experience no matter what the outcome.  




 It sounds like you have a lot of really good advice to share, so I thought I would ask a question. It's a bit detailed, but I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to deal with my managers.

I have been working at a large government organisation for 18 months and am quite junior.

Although I'm technical I can see a major problem with the organisation (it is primarily a business issue but has ramifications for IT), and I previously raised it with the 2nd in charge (sort of like COO). I regret that I didn't have a solution at the time, as he asked me what I suggest we need to do. I told him that I would need some time to think and reasearch a solution. After I explained that I may offend my managers for raising it directly with him and not my immediate manager, he said he would send an email inviting me to sit with him and with the head of IT to discuss my ideas. 

After this meeting I told my manager that the 2nd in charge would like to discuss my ideas, and he said I needed to present to him first. I saw that as a good thing as it was a chance to get some valuable feedback.

However, since then I've moved to another manager in the IT department, and this manager would also like me to present to him first, and then if he approves I can present to my senior manager. After presenting to the senior manager, if he approves then I will be able to present to the head of IT and all the other senior managers. If they are all okay with it, then I will be able to meet with the 2nd in charge to discuss my idea. 

I believe this process is going to take a few months and it is quite frustrating, as this is just an idea (and hasn't been approved by anyone yet, and is primarily a business idea), and also the 2nd in charge has asked me to go see him.

I don't know what to do in this sort of situation. I know I can go directly to the 2nd in charge and say that I am still very keen but I have been asked to present to others first before I can talk to him, but I know that will annoy a lot of people. I have spoken to my manager to explain that it wasn't really necessary to present to all senior managers first before going to the 2nd in charge as it was more of a business issue. He couldn't give me a good reason why I had to and in the end said he would talk to the head of IT to see if we can just present to him. 

I just feel that they are putting up roadblocks for me and I am not doing this for me but because I really honestly believe that the organisation will benefit from this (and I have attended senior business meetings where they have raised issues relating to this problem that affect the work). The main reason that I think they are doing it is because it will probably create more work for the IT department, but I believe that if the business thinks it is important then that is up to them to decide and not IT.

I would just like to know what you think is the right thing to do in this sort of situation?

 




 I think you need optimism when you're really young. He will be brought back down to earth in time. I don't think you could get through some of the early challenges in life without optimism. Also agree that he has a lot to learn. 

I think business education is good for helping you know how to manage or run a business but not necessarily give you the skills required to actually produce an output. If he really wants to do these ideas, he might need to learn a second skill.  




 Just got home from work, and don't want to think about anything! 




 A dwarf walks into a bar and he slips over a piece of shit on the floor, he walks off thinking nothing of it.

So the big man kills him.

 Best schools/universities: The quality depends a lot on the teachers. 

University advice: Go introduce yourself and don't be shy asking questions in class, or talking to your lecturers. Pay attention when they tell you what the assessments are/how they are graded, and start working on them early. Don't worry about what other people are doing. Don't fail a subject more than once.

Ways to save money: Don't buy shit you don't need. Food costs a lot - take your own food/snacks.

Getting a job: Just get whatever you can to begin with, then upgrade when you can. 

Can't comment on the other two.

 I'm not great at diagrams, but here's my shot at it: [http://imgur.com/INMR5.gif](http://imgur.com/INMR5.gif) 




 Check whether she usually wears gold or silver colored necklaces. Usually people have a preference for one or the other. I'm not sure what things cost there but I'm guessing 9ct Gold or white gold should be good.

If she likes stones, you can pick a stone in a particular color you think she'll like (sometimes jewellery stores arrange their pendants by the color). Otherwise you can go for something with multiple coloured stones or just a nice simple design with no stones or clear stones. You could also look at lockets if you think she'd like that.

Don't get plated jewellery. I think that stuff is a waste of money because it just wears out and then looks crap. 




 Yeah I don't know if it was because of me (my parents never made an official complaint because they thought it would make it harder for me at school) but the teacher left the school a year later. 




 At a school camp I fell into a ditch playing a game and broke my arm. I couldn't sleep because of the pain, and went to tell the teacher that I thought I'd sprained it. She told me to take a drink of water and go back to bed. I cried myself to sleep.

Then the next day a friend had a bandage so I put it on. The teacher told me to take it off because it was dirty. 

I didn't participate in archery or abseiling which is unusual for me because I love those two things, but she kept treating me like I was overreacting.

I got an x-ray 2 days later and it showed a fracture of the wrist. I got a cast and returned to school. The teacher gave me the dirtiest looks and hated me since then. 




 Haha I didn't notice that!

 Yeah that's pretty selfish lol. I mean she could even use it first and then let you use it, and if she really didn't want to use it after that, then she could throw it out and get a new one since a toothbrush is like $2. I hope she at least let you have some mouthwash. 




 Don't worry she might not like you but I love hair and bananas!!

 Their sheep string internet days are meant to be [nearly over!](http://www.digitaltasmania.org/news/14/58)

Although, they said something about Tasmanians being the first to get a [medical smartcard too back in 2004](http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/soa/Tasmania-to-get-first-taste-of-Medicare-smartcard/0,130061744,139154706,00.htm) lol. 

Recently I saw a news story about the fast Tassie internet. They were interviewing locals to see how excited they were about their improved connection speeds. There was about 2 people out on the streets in this tiny town, and they ended up interviewing an old couple who probably didn't even own a computer. 




 I'm worried that he was so specific. Is it okay for the dogs to eat a whole citizen, as long as they don't just take bits and pieces? They're not allowed to waste their food when dogs in Africa are starving? 




 I find the argument that a data mining system (and I'm specifically talking about TIA which no longer exists) produces false positives kind of poor, because correct me if I'm wrong, but false positives come up all the time in investigations. For example during a murder investigation, you would have several suspects most of which are likely to be false positives.

I think the real problem is the fact that you can arrest someone on suspicion of a terrorist attack without proving their guilt/intent like you would normally do in a murder/intent to murder scenario. 

In terms of data mining also, although it's impossible, I think it's a broad decision by US citizens - if you know that known terrorists have engaged in a particular pattern of behaviour, and that other terrorists are likely to also engage in that behaviour, is it okay with you if anyone engaging in that pattern of behavior is scrutinized? Keep in mind the majority of suspects are also likely not to be terrorists. I can't answer that question for you, but for me, if the laws around the system protected me from being falsely accused, and the information was only used for the purpose of identify potential terrorists, then I think I may be okay with it. To be clear, I'm not saying that these conditions hold true. 

The second argument that it's an invasion of privacy/risk of abuse due to free access to personal records is reasonable enough. But can't the FBI/CIA/NSA get this information if they choose to anyway? (I'm seriously asking - because I don't know). It sounds like this system just makes it easier for them through the data warehouse (the article actually doesn't say how they use data mining for this system). 

I can completely understand why people don't trust the government with their information, since some of the new terrorist laws don't seem to protect their rights and are open to abuse. Just like a terrorist shouldn't be able to take away your life, the government shouldn't be able to take away a suspect's livelihood based on a hunch either. I think it's up to law enforcement to recognise that statistical likelihood isn't proof. 

It seems to me that the problem isn't really the system and the access to information. But it's the fact that there is a large amount of room for abuse by law enforcement because of the laws relating to suspected terrorists.

 I started thinking... how could you not notice...

But then I remembered my cat is really fluffy too, and we didn't notice she was pregnant until about 4 weeks before she gave birth to a litter of 4 kittens!! My mum was getting a little worried about my cat's weight and my sister felt her belly and could feel the kittens moving around inside!   




 I'm in Australia. Most gay men I know talk like normal people. I don't think most people would even know they were gay. 

Of my good gay friends, only one of the three is outwardly and obviously gay. He does act a bit like a girl so I think his behaviour is more of a giveaway than the way he talks. 

There would be some people here who talk in a certain way but I am guessing that is their way of expressing themselves, and it might seem 'put on' but maybe it is just their way of letting their personality and thoughts shine through. 




 I reckon you could encourage them to go for another one, but if they really want it then just go with it and be there to support them. My dad never came to any of my games, and while I don't care now when I was a younger I took that as a sign of disinterest/lack of caring about what I do (since sport was so important to me). 




 I'd agree with this. I did a *lot* of sports when I was young, and sport can help you in all areas of life - socially, physically, mentally. You learn how to make friends, how to keep healthy and fit, and how to cope when you're under pressure, how to deal with losing, how good it feels when you do win, and how to juggle sports with school and other activities.  




 I'm not sure if this is the same with most pregnant girls, but my sister at least went into a 'nesting' phase to make the house ready for the baby. If there's anything you can do to improve your house then I think that could help.

Also just give her lots of hugs - I've heard a hug has to be 7 seconds or longer for you to get that good/happy feeling out of it.

 Yeah definitely. My blinds were shining bright red when I got up, but now it is more of a grey and just looks a bit like fog. 




 I keep seeing that in all the photos in the newspaper.  My guess is they don't realise it's dust. When I woke up I thought it was red because of a fire, and then I looked outside it kinda looked like weird fog.  




 I'm pretty sick too with the flu - I've been at home all this week. I've had a lot of trouble sleeping the past couple of nights because of my coughing. This morning, I went outside for just a few seconds to take a look after I noticed the red sky, and came inside and was coughing up a lung. 

I can smell the dust inside but I didn't think it was that bad... Staying home today though.

 There's a few different kinds of late for me. 

First, there's the I'm late because I don't care - this usually involves being at work on time. It's true, it's a direct reflection on the fact that I dislike my job. I do wake up and set out to be on time but just feel lethargic and take forever to get out of the house because I know what lies ahead is another crap day at work. 

Second, I'm late because I have taken on too many things. I did have a job once that required me to be at work by 7am and I worked every day til 7pm. I used to always be rushing and driving way too fast, and found it too stressful. This was more that I didn't get to bed early the night before because I had too much on my schedule. I was working full time and studying part time and just had trouble staying on top of my assignments, sleep and work. 

Third, I'm late because I've been held up. Usually I'll be heading out the door and something important comes up at the last minute. It's not intentional but I have to deal with it at the time. Sometimes it's only 5 minutes, other times its longer, but I really try to ignore things whenever I can. 

Fourth, I'm late because I'm disorganised. I really do plan a time to get to things, but sometimes I just suck. Once I was away from my place on holidays, and forgot to turn on the hot water when I got back, and I stank like cat piss, so had to turn on the hot water so I could have a lukewarm shower to get to an event. Other times I lose my car keys or wallet, because I can also be a messy person. I really hate the fact that I'm me sometimes.

Fifth, I'm late because I'm me. Sometimes I just don't feel like I want to rush. It's stressful rushing, and I will probably just feel like crap if I rush. I won't be late for you if you are waiting in an uncomfortable spot for me though. I may be late if you are with other people and you're not waiting by yourself. I am often late if you are waiting in the comfort of your own home, and I'm pretty sure watching the tv for a few more minutes won't kill you.

There's probably other reasons for other circumstances but I can't think of them right now.

Just wanted to also add, it's not personal or intentional. If I didn't care then I wouldn't plan to see/meet you, and I wouldn't bother continuing a friendship. I realise that most people feel that it is inconsiderate and so more often these days I make a conscious effort to be on time, but what's a few more minutes anyway...

 




 For the other experiment, 21 people doesn't seem to be a big enough sample size once you divide them into 3 activity groups. Interesting results with the mice though...

 Some heels are more difficult to walk in. If you're having trouble, steer clear of tiny heeled stilettos, cause you'll probably just look silly trying to walk. 
If you can find something you like with a bigger heel surface area that touches the ground you'll have more stability and hopefully be more comfortable. If you don't mind wedges these can be great.
Another tip is if you're having trouble walking is try not to go for anything too pointy, cause that makes it harder to balance too. 




 Don't show off too much. Like everyone else said, keep to one feature. Otherwise it just looks tarty. Also don't wear anything too tight, being able to see where your underwear is pulling folds in your skin is not a good look. 

Also skirts should be at or below where your thigh starts to curve inwards is a good rule. 

Be comfortable and confident. You won't look classy and hot if you're uncomfortable with what you're wearing and/or can't walk properly, or if you keep trying to cover yourself. 

 




 There's always something to improve in any house, so I'd just pick something and then learn the different ways of doing it. Repeat as many times as you like. Often the best way to learn about something is to fix something broken. I learnt a lot about toilet cisterns because mine wouldn't stop dripping.  




 I am too busy to look after myself, and when I'm not too busy I make myself busy cause I don't want to think about my problems, but then I do and I get overwhelmed, because I don't look after myself and I get run down. Right now I have a broken shoulder and tonsilitis.

I am actually happy today though. I'd rather be injured and sick than have to go to work :) Plus I get to sleep a lot and eat jelly! 




 What's the occasion? How much do you want to spend?

For a view of the harbour - in customs house - [Cafe Sydney](http://www.cafesydney.com). More expensive and you have to book but great food and awesome view for an occasion (make sure you get the balcony).

For cheaper places, I really like Newtown for Thai (Thai Riffic for a nice seating place or Doytao Thai for cheaper food).

Tony Romas near King Street Wharf is awesome for Ribs. Kinda like american food.

My favourite pizza/italian place is [Made in Italy](http://www.madeinitaly.com.au). I've never eaten at Pyrmont but I have at Wynyard. Wynyard is a takeaway place but the pizza was excellent.

 I'm just wondering if anyone has any comments on using XML for data transfer of small data sets between organisations? My experience so far has been good for this purpose and I haven't noticed any problems. The data comes from HP and Oracle systems and we load it into SQL Server.

Also typed XML hasn't gotten much of a mention here. I thought the validation of a data type was a good thing. Does anyone have any comments on typed XML? 




 The emphasis on sport in Canada sounds similar to in Australia. It's not really like the US. We do have sports teams and maybe some students get sports scholarships (not really sure), but it definitely isn't as big of a deal as I've seen when visiting the US. The point made by Anand999 about getting people to fund the university through sports doesn't really apply here.

 I tried this at my work too, but only had my crappy phone to take a photo with. You could see heaps more than without the tape, as in make out objects, but it was pretty blurry.

That is looking out of a meeting room into the photocopier room! The photo is of tape on the frosted side - I could see both into and out of the room. 

Tried putting tape on both sides of the glass (frosted and non-frosted) - this made no a difference to the level of distortion compared to when it was only on the frosted side.

Tried putting tape on the non-frosted side and that didn't do anything - I couldn't see in or out!
