 For me it was SneakerHeadInTheBay, he would end his videos with Cocoa Butter Kisses.

 So, in this [picture](https://www.imgur.com/4y36GGP), the left side of the plant is dead, while the right is alive. But they're connected at the root. Why? 









 I said to give me suggestions for songs to edit [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChanceTheRapper/comments/2y0wdw/give_me_suggestions/) and I did them. Here is [Iconic](http://bit.ly/1APkSZl) (only a DL link) and 
[Long Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YxLKumuzQI),
Give me some more! I can do any song!

EDIT: "Iconic" got taken down from YouTube for copyright, so I will just have the DL link there.

 So, a while ago, I edited the song "Confident" by Justin Bieber   Chance The Rapper to *only* include Chance's verse [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChanceTheRapper/comments/2x8eto/justin_bieber_no_more/). Give me suggestions of songs to do this with! Any song that Chance is in, and you want his verse singled out, I can do.

 Tony Bennett, The Ink Spots, VI Seconds, CES Cru, Logic, Frank Sinatra, Avenged Sevenfold, Sleeping With Sirens, Vic Mensa, Mac Miller, and like all of OF.

I'm a bit varied. 




 I edited the song "Confident" and took out most of the Justin Bieber. Only the bridge + the hook is in there.

 I really wanna play it, and I see others have access to it as well. So, I was wondering if there was a download link or something along those lines, in which to acquire this wonderful game. 




 You can't. 




 This will be done.
