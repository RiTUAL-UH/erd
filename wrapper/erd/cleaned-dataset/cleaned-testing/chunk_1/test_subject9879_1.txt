 You definitely will have to choose between being a computational expert, or a synthesis person or a characterization expert. If you want to do 2D materials do apply to Penn State, Berkeley, GaTech and Rice. 




 1) No. You won't if you are doing electronic materials. But having a solid state physics course will be worth its weight in gold. A big misconception about MatSE is that it is chemistry heavy, but unless you are doing polymers you don't need to worry.

2) Many EE profs are in the fab side - ask them. Also do NOT go by US news rankings - they are utter shit in MSE.

3) I am male, but several of my friends are female in MSE, and they mostly say the atmosphere is collegial apart from the obvious overwork aspect.

4) If you really want to go for MSE - I will say go for it. But your GPA will be counted against you. It is hard to get into a good program below a 3.5 unless you have some really good experience that a PI wants or you have publications during your undergrad. 




 Do you have a good friend in your group? If possible try interacting with this lab tech along with your friend.
And email EVERYTHING. Before you meet him, after always. My rule for interacting with difficult people - take your notebook, and jot down stuff while interacting, and send an email immediately after confirming all the things discussed. Always helps. 




 There was a similar study in Economics - where Harvard, MIT and Chicago produce the bulk of new faculty.
Same in my field - materials science where the top 10 schools (top 10 is a bit debatable though) produce the majority of faculty.  




 Could you ask the company for a deferment of the job till your PhD is done?
 




 Have you taken the physics GRE? If you are looking into physics schools that counts much more often. 




 For me it has been working with an untenured faculty in a big, prominent department. They are scared, and under pressure for tenure, and all that is transferred to you with a vengeance.  




 Yes, I buy the cheapest beer possible. Every night downing a few while chain smoking is my new "me time". 




 Same here at Penn State. The campus is now dry. The school has even rescheduled its Spring Break to coincide with St. Patrick's Day so that undergrads are out of town then. 




 Yeah I was a lurker, before I decided to take the plunge, and I will learn a bit more before posting next time :) 














 I know, but as girls are bombarded 24 hours with photoshopped washn\board abs, even those comfortable in bodies feel inadequate. Just my 2 cents. 




 ya, pirate drones!!  




 Several years back, when cleaning out my grandfather's stuff we found his old Omega watch that everyone assumed had been lost for 60 years. And my first reaction was how small men's watches were back in the day!
