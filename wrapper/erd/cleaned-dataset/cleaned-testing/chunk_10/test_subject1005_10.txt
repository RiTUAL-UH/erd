 As an American, for example, I always assumed Russia exactly like it is in Rocky 4. What're your perceptions?  




 You don't know what you're talking about. That much I can assure you.  




 lol okay man 




 I'm not bashing Wes Anderson, because for the most part I enjoy his work, but I really don't think he's the creative genius r/movies makes him out to be. Just an opinion.  




 You either completely misunderstood what OP posted, or you're a troll. Pick one.  




 The worst Frasier fan theory I have ever heard. 




 No, but I apparently am not the only one who was misled judging by comments and posts in this thread and sub.  




 I am so sorry to take up your valuable time on Reddit. But here are the facts of the situation. Bryan Cranston, hot off his Breaking Bad fame, get casted in a new blockbuster where he, and HE ALONE, dominated the trailer. You can defend as much as you want, but it doesn't change the fact it was marketed as though Cranston would be a bigger part of the movie. And why wouldn't they? People like me who have no interest in Godzilla, but have an interest in Break Bad's star would go see the movie. You have not made one concrete point to the contrary. I'm sorry you're annoyed, but your position is tough to defend when there are 30 different trailers you could pull up to prove my point.  




 Ah I didn't know HBO had a series. Was it live action or animated? 




 its a COSBY SWEATAH!!!! 




 WHAT.....FUCKING......IAN GUY?! 




 Casting a better Clown than Jon Leguizama-nagga-nagga-whatshisname would be difficult. He was so damn disgusting and amazing in that role.  




 So, you're saying they didn't use Cranston to sell the movie? That's your position?  




 False advertising. At least that's my complaint. If he wasn't such a huge part of the trailer, it wouldn't bug me in the slightest. But it was advertised like he was the star and it is very clear why they did that. For example, it didn't bug me in the slightest that Ben Affleck was killed off immediately in Smokin Aces. Everyone knew he was in it, but it wasn't marketed like he was the star. Huge difference.   




 I did, yes. I thought it was pretty good actually.  




 I don't recall seeing the preview. Can you elaborate? 




 Observe and Report was very similar. It looked so goofy and ended up being wayyyy weird and dark.  




 I have to disagree with you. It was obvious that Godzilla used Cranston to sell the movie in the trailer. Their marketing wasn't as strategic as your comment may suggest.  




 When Godzilla came out, Bryan Cranston dominated every TV spot. When we went and saw it, my friends and I were seriously upset when his character died 25 minutes into the movie.  









 Cliff! 




 Why do you say that? Not trying to be argumentative, but it seemed like a great board for AK. I'm newer, so I'd appreciate the insight.  




 Hahaha my bad, was writing on the go. But you get the gist.  




 Spot on. Spot. fucking. on.  




 They still make them, but no one sees them. I could still get down all day on 3 Ninjas :) 




 Not to mention, if the claim is true, he could be a very dangerous fugitive on the run. 




 I'm a little confused about something. When the local police are investigating Tom on his identity to see if there is any weight to the mob's claim that he is someone else, why are they simply just asking him? Couldn't they actually do some investigation (SSN, birth cert, etc...) to verify his identity? He's a pretty popular member of his community.  




 Oh I wasn't implying you were paranoid. It reads like cheating to me too.  




 To be fair, and I'm not suggesting you are doing this, there are A LOT of people who start claiming collusion in some of the sit n go tourneys when they start losing. In a particular hand (you'll have to forgive me as I don't recall specifics), I was dealt small pocket pair like 2s and raised from late position. Big blind called me and it was heads up. Flop was a bunch of faces and he and I checked it down. Turned out he had a smaller pocket pair. But another player,small stacked and not in the hand, started accusing he and I of colluding. I think it may be a way of some players acting out their tilt. In your case, it does sound different however.  




 I always get misty at that scene. Specifically when he starts crying. Tom Hanks is seriously solid for making people feel sad in that scene. I remember in theaters when Wilson first plops into the water while Hanks is sleeping, MANY murmured "oh no!" Incredible movie.  




 John Ritter. He was even the "model" father in North at the end of North's list of parents. He's perfect.  




 I like to have WSOP on while doing online tourneys are literally just heard Norman Chad say that moments before reading this haha your point has been made. 




 How to play a hand for example, or styles. What are the issues most commonly debated? 




 Idk why everyone just got downvoted. You literally answered my question....
