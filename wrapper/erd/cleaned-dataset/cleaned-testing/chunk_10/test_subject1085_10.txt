 I recently moved to an older part of town that is being renovated, mostly by the hipster crowd. Since dropping out of college, my parents refused to pay my bills, so I was left with few options. This lead me to get a job at one of the the non-renovated buildings, a gas station that looks like it's been there since the 1970's.

You could say I was less than thrilled. My parents had money, and I never worked a day in my life. I was shocked that any place would hire me, but since the area was a hipster haven, not many people wanted to work at the gas station. Honestly, it's so slow. I don't know how it's still open. Because the volume of customers, I spend a lot of time on my phone or occasionally looking through the small offices area that is shared by all the workers. One day as I was looking, I came across a journal that was a little more than weird. Other than spelling, I changed punctuation to make it more readable.

"August 25, 1984

We finally got a gas stashun like the one the next town over, Owensville! Guess who got a job?! THat's right! I did! My pa is so proud that I'm a workin' man! I've started this journel to 'member my furst job!"

August 28, 1984

I started trainin' today! I don't think I'm goin' to like this job as much as I thoght. They asked mE to work nite shift since I dropped out of high scool." In a town like this, their's no one out at nite, so it luks like you'll be hereing from me a lot!"

"August 29, 1984

The person training me jus left. He said I should be ok for a bit because I need to be used to being aLone and having to solve problems without a manager since I'll be alone my whole 11pm-7am shift. I hope I can handle the store alone. My biggest fear is being robed thogh. I here that haPpens alot here in town. Since I live in the country, the worst thing that happens is a bit of cow tippin."

"August 30, 1984

Well, this is worse than I thoght! It's 2am, and I've only had 1 person, and I already finished my cleanin'. What aM suppost to do for the next 5 hours? What's worse is that my pa expects me to help plow the feilds tomorrow at 8:30am because I'm off tomarr nite. I wish I coud work day time time, but boss says I'm rite were he needs me. Maybe, I can save my monee and move to town like sum of my friends. Then, I coud sleep and do what ever I want. He can't make me work if I ain't there."

"September 3, 1984

Sorry it's ben so long. Pa found out 'bout my plan to move from the farm, and wouldn't let me go bak to work. He said my job is in the fEilds providing' for my famly. Boss called quite a few times the furst day I missed work. Pa didn't let me me anser, so that nite, I sneaked out and ran all the way to town. It took a while, but now I'm a free man. I'm stayin' with my friend, Jakob, until I save monee. I went to boss yesturday and explained why I hadn't been at work. He was mad, but said he needed me to bad to fir me. He said he would keep a eye on me thouh. I'm not too happy here, but it's my way out of the farm."

"September 4, 1984

Welp, it's dead agin. I might get used to this. It lets me think about my life. I might go take my GED, since I have all this time to learn. Pa made me quit scool to help him, but he woodn't even look at me when I seen him in town. That's ok thouh. My boss says I might have a future hear at the stashun if I don't screw up no more. Even though, I don't have monee yet, I've been lookin' for places. By the end of the month, I mite have my own place."

"September 29, 1984

Sorry, it's been so long. Like I told you last time, I went to get my GED. I failed the first time because I fell asleep after a long shift here. It's ok though because I sceduled a new one yesterday, since I was off last night, and I passed it! It was very exciting! Boss says with my GED, I might get his position one day. That would be nice. I'd get to be around people again. I moved out of Jacob's a few days ago, and I thought I would like living alone. Now, I realize how alone I am working night shift. The only people I talk to are the guy that I relieve and Boss who relieves me. I'm sure I'll get used to it or get the manager's job when he leaves."

"October 3rd, 1984

I got great news today! Boss said he's promoting me to assistant manager. He says I'll still be on night shift though. I don't know why night shift needs a manager when it's only me, but he gave me a raise. So I guess it's ok."

"October 30, 1984

The lights keep flickering, and it doesn't matter what I do. They keep flickering and making a slight click sound. Even though, I turned the lights off, there's still that horrible clicking. I don't know how I haven't heard it before."

"November 15, 1984

It's getting cold here, but I can't get the heater to work. The clicking is still happening, but no one else seems to hear the sound. Boss says it's all in my head from being lonely, but he gives me a funny smile when he says it."

"December 1, 1984

"I've come to like the clicking. It's almost a friend. I don't have friend anymore. There's too much to do here. How can I have friends when I need to take care of the station? Anytime I think of leaving to get another job, I hear the clicking getting louder and faster, as if begging me to stay."

"January 10, 1985

I wish I could say I'm sorry for not writing, but I'm not. This will be the last entry. Now that I have the clicking as company, I don't need to write anymore. I finally have friends and almost a family again. Thanks for the company during the lonely nights, but I'll never be alone again. *NEVER AGAIN*.

Goodbye,

Alexander Samuels"

Since I found this journal, I have started hearing a clicking, but I know it's all in my imagination because it started after I read the journal. I'll keep you posted

**Update**

After all the lonely nights, I decided to start a journal. I don't need dates because it's only to comfort me.

Entry 1

My friends don't want to Hang out with me anymore. They say that since I started working that I'm too tired to too busy to party with them. ThEy'll never know what it's like to have to work and pay your own bills. They won't be missed reaLly. I want peoPle like Me who know the lonely pain... I mEan the thrill of working night shift. I've still been hearing the clicking, but I guess it's because I keep thinking about that journal.

Entry 2

My old friends came by today and asked why I hadn't been talking to them. I was confused. They didn't want me around, but when I tried to show them the texts, they looked at me like I was crazy because they weren't there. I know they sent them. The must be trying to make fun of me. I don't need them anyway. I don't have time for them.

Entry 3

I talked to the boss today about the clicking. He got a strange smile and told me it would be okay. For the first time, I noticed his name was Alexander Samuels. That sounds so familiar, but I don't remember where from. It doesn't really matter though. I am happy with the easy chatter of the station. The boss also said I might have a future here, and he's been thinking about promoting me. That would be too exciting!

Entry 4

Working in a gas station in an almost abandoned town can have an effect on you. Especially when you always work graveyard alone.

I never realized the changes in myself from sitting in a small, dirty box for over 8 hours, 5 days a week.

It happens so slowly that you don't realize how fast your sanity can escape when you're isolated, working graveyard shift at an almost abandoned gas station.

I no longer want to leave my station. This is my family. My friends. My home.

You can be a part of our family too. Just come with me and join the night crew. 









 She hasn't come back, and I haven't heard a word from my manager. I'm assuming she didn't care enough to just call the next day. Either way, it wouldn't have affected me. 




 I always that it came from the crappy idea that customers are always right. They are not always right. Sometimes they are very, very wrong. 




 Yes! Sorry! Should have made it more clear! 




 When I told her between 10:30-11 




 If you've read my posts before, you know that I work for a decently large grocery store in the fuel center. First of the month is always the best time to be working (sarcasm). As most people know, this weekend is America's Independence Day, so that means they're even worse than normal.

A fine example of this is Screaming Creature (SC for short). I've already dealt with the people who still seem to fail to understand how a gas pump works or that I don't have a "fill up" button for your car, so my day was already going well.

I thought it couldn't get worse, until SC walks up to my window. The following conversation took place:

Me: May I help you?

SC: What time you close?

Me: We normally close between 10:30 and 11.  It depends if the people inside the store come out to give us a lunch. If they don't, we have to close 30 minutes early so we don't get over time.

SC: I don't care about that! I asked what time you close!

Me: 11.

SC: Well, I was here last night at 10:53, and you were closed! I rushed to get here, and you were closed!

Me: I'm sorry, Ma'am! I didn't get a lunch yesterday, so I had to close early. If I didn't, I would get written up!

SC: I told you I don't care about that! I rushed to get here, and you were closed! Let me talk to a manager!

Me: Ma'am, you have to go inside to talk to a manager. There's no one else in here.

SC: (staring incredulously) You're telling me you don't have a manager?!

Me: Not out here, Ma'am. We're a part of the bigger store, so they stay up there.

SC: Fine! I'm going there anyway! I'll just tell him about this, and he'll handle this. 

I look around the parking lot and realize the manager has left for the day. I smile big and wish her a Happy 4th of July! 




 LoL! Wouldn't that make me accessory to a crime? 




 LoL! That is a good thing! 




 At least they were thorough about it! LoL! 




 LoL! That's what I was thinking! I had completely forgot about hitting it! 




 LoL! Cameras are everywhere, but yeah, as long as they haven't fixed it by now! Also, I can't do that its against the sub rules! LoL! 




 That is stupid! I'm glad we didn't have to be as strict about it. I told my manager, it got turned off (suspended?), and it was over 




 That would be a horrible coincidence! 




 That's very true!  At least I'm in a bullet proof case, with a cell phone and a land phone! 




 Sorry should have put S.O.L., so you'd know that it was acronym! At work and a little out of it! 




 That's what my manager said! I'm still not sure if they fixed it, or if we're just sol
