 I'm sorry to hear that. Please read A Prayer For Owen Meany.  




 What is yours  charger called? 




 r/ImAlmostHomeless.  




 Thank you. I remember a friend telling me that this book was the author's memoir, but I don't care for authors, just books.  




 I bought a kindle, I use I read about 3 books on it.  




 It's okay. What is important is to know what you are reading as opposed to how you are reading.  




 You came to the internet, to a community tethered by individuals with one comment interest: reading; and you come here to complain without some personal insight? No one cares if you read or not. I will forget about you in 5 seconds, and so will everyone else in a few hours. I like it when people don't read. It makes my life easier.  




 Not sure which laws apply to you, but from a US standpoint, minors cannot not legally sign contracts with organizations, you need a guardian to sign you.  




 I'm still confused about the ending. So the book proceed to tell a story of a protagonist and how her life went to shit. First she was on an internship then started dating some ashole in medical school, then she goes crazy and gets sent the asylum.But I'm not sure why Joan was there at the end, and how she killed herself. Ending is confusing, anyone wish to explain? 




 Don't do it. Unless you are going to marry her, and she has blown you at least 300 times.  




 You must out on so many books. Least you're not a fool anymore.  




 What a bohemian. 




 /r/minamilism would love this. 




 Never been to those states, but I live in CA, and in summer it's about 95-100 degrees most of the time. The difference is CA is just hot  where as Japan is humid. You feel sticky and that is what makes you feel the hottest. I've  never used an umbrella  for the sun, before either but there's a first for everything.  




 I'm in Shinjuku and it's humid. People are using umbrellas- including myself- during the day time. It's so hot. And sporadic rain sometimes too. Not stormy, just hot.  




 This is exactly why I travel. Life is just too demanding. But when I travel, I just take clothes, phone, money, passport and a book. I return ready to read for the next few months, until I need another vacation. 




 Haven't read that one yet, but I finished A Prayer For Owen Meany about 2 years ago, and I still cannot forget the ending.  




 A Prayer For Owen Meany, by John Irving. 

That books felt like a movie being played in front of me, every descriptive scene felt like I in the room, viewing from a 1 way mirror.  




 I wonder if this book will be the book I fall into.  




  Every book I read, influences my life. Whether for the good or bad.  




 Unfortunately you lack discipline, unless you have a mental stigma. There is no teaching this, as you will have to endeavor this yourself. My best advice is to travel, every new country I visit, my lust grows for reading. You just have to find your beat and follow the rhythm.  




 I never have sense of pride when reading, it's nothing to be proud of. Only when one finished the book, one senses a myriad of conflicting emotions such as mourning or blissfulness; pride never crosses my mind when reading.  




 I exchanged it two weeks ago, and I fly back to the Americas tomorrow.  




 I started reading when I was 17, but gave it up at 19 when University and work started to take my time away from me, as the internet did as well, but you know what made me read again? Not having access to the internet. As banal as that advice sounds it works. I am 19 currently studying abroad in Japan, and I have no access to the internet most of the time, but I took a book with me even though I don't have the habit, I still enjoy reading - this contradicts itself, but I take a book with me, in a case where I do actually read it. However, I find myself constantly at a coffee shop or park bench reading. It's so amazing when you don't have the internet in your ear, or worrying about Facebook. You really need to travel to get the urge in you again, that's how I see it. Or just cancel your internet to rekindle the connection, otherwise you're just going to go on the internet instead of picking up a book.  




 **:)** 




 Disgusting.  




 I hate these about 2 days ago, my stomach starting hurting, never again. 




 Also don't eat your kids, play with them.  




 Do you have a pair of other shoes? Those shoes don't match with your glares.  




 Usually when a person is mean, it's due to "projection". When an individual projects a certain attitude leads to many possible solutions; in this case, I'm using the internet as a way to vent my loneliness. I figured it out, but there is little I can do without continuing the vicious cycle. "I'm sorry" is an ideal apology, but I will do it again tomorrow, so what's the point? I'm just so lonely, I fsdafds;jkl a.fs 




 I put down my anime posters last year. It's just a life transition. It's like having a picture of barney on your wall. You used to like it, but now you can't like it anymore. You must like something more age appropriate or else people will think you're weird if you're not in the crowd; but since you are asking how to blend in- you're not ready to be a Bohemian. 




 I never had this mindset. As I am always trying new things, I never run of things to say, "why am I doing this?" As opposed to, "She's so fucking hot" and I work my ass off and try to conquer her heart. I live my life for love. I sacrifice everything for it.  




 hoarding is a psychological disorder, minamilism is a way of life. To me, minalism  is an art form, soley to please me. Minalism  and poverty aren't associated though. In my life, I have expensive shit, but little of it. I don't get myself off the shit that is worthless to me.  




 Too much water.  




 It's best not to help people who don't need it. Just smile and wave, and laugh about it later.  









 New one is: riretashiro  




 I remember a time I used to be stupid. Gosh, I was suppressed I didn't kill myself; I can't imagine how depressed and lonely you are.

 I stopped buying brand paper, I like kraft paper with bindings. Unfortunately I wasn't  going to pay shipping for them so I flew to Japan I buy 5.  




 In Japan too? 




 damn-it.  




 Little to none. I go to school, go to work, and go home. I travel for fun.  




 don't send me money 




 This isn't r/videogames.
