 It is ludicrously powerful for what it is used for, and is designed so that there is no chance of the target surviving a single shot, further enforcing the concept that Sybil is a perfect system that doesn't make mistakes. If someone is to die, they die, no wounding shots, no slow accidental bleed outs, no mistakes.  




 Psycho-Pass

Edit: The anime is Psycho-Pass. It's on Netflix and season 2 is on Hulu. 














 [La Maison en Petits Cubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_2Sc8fD_Kc feature=youtu.be) - a Japanese animated short about an old man reliving both the fond and sad moments of his life. 2008 Academy Award Winner.

 It's a medium. Just like live-action shows, movies, books, comic books and etc. it's made up of different genres like sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, romance, action, adventure and so on and so forth.

 Kill Bill was great.

For anyone in a mood for a short revenge flick, [here's a short anime titled Carnage](https://streamable.com/mkkq) (NSFW).

 I liked that some of them left. That was real. However well thought out and logical policy changes are, when applied in such a sudden, sweeping and inconsiderate way it will make employees unhappy. If they're talented with sought out skills then they will leave for a place where they can happily pursue their career goals. People will call it selfish or entitled but to me that's life. 




 Eh. It's not so black and white. It's a good portrayal of chasm that sometimes exists between management and employees. The employees don't take the larger picture into account. The management just sees them as numbers and not actually people with thoughts and emotions.    









 I liked Harmony better than Genocidal Organ. It handled heavy exposition in a better and more palatable way. Harmony's MC was also more personable which made her easier to get attached to. Both novels are soul-crushers. 



















 Watched Despicable Me 2 and The Book of Life.

Despicable Me 2 was adorable and funny. Steve Carell voice acting was on point. It also looked great for its relatively modest budget of $76 million.

The Book of Life didn't appeal to me. The marionettes art style didn't look good. The love triangle was very one-sided.

 That was exciting. The only change I could think of is maybe increase the number of 425 homers or the distance for the 30 second bonus. Everyone got the two 425 homer requirement easily.

[She also cosplayed Yuki Mori](http://i.imgur.com/s2qRzVN.jpg) from [Space Battleship Yamato 2199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or09dSlxltM). Great anime and I highly recommend it. 




 That's true for any medium though. Most movies, tv shows, music, comic books, and books are not good.  




 The Old Vitor 




 The moment Yamada asked how a spotter is chosen I immediately realized it's Noa. Got a good laugh out of me, great comedic set-up. 









 MC's situation reminds me a bit of Big Head from Silicon Valley. They keep getting unknowingly promoted. The big difference is Itami is actually competent.

 It's an Irish animated film.

 




 Just finished Song of the Sea. Beautiful art and story. 














 Sports can be at times be a soap opera for men. Not a complaint, I get a good amount of entertainment out of it. 




 For anyone interested in anime short films here's a newly created sub - /r/AnimeShortFilms 




 Does PA Works even own the title? If they don't the committee can just hire another director and studio. It's a highly unlikely scenario but a possibility. 




 [Muybridge's Strings](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10688/Muybridge_no_Ito) is a short film by the Oscar-nominated Koji Yamamura. Its a parallel storytelling of [Eadweard Muybridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadweard_Muybridge) life and a mothers life with her daughter. The connecting theme is time. Muybridges sequential photography captures moments in time and in a way the mother desires to do similarly with her time with her daughter.

 Parsons should've sealed the deal with a pinky swear. 




 The beam of light censorship strikes again. We only get to see Gin's nipples unattached. 




 Mamiya looked cute with the asymmetrical ponytail. A bit surprised Tsubasa didn't have a nose bleed when seeing Mamiya in a bikini. 

The intersecting storylines was also nice.

 The director of Inaka Isha, Kji Yamamura, does a lot of absurdist short films. You might like his other films, Mt. Head, The Old Crocodile, and Your Choice. I think his best film is Muybridge's Strings, which is more serious and thematic.

 The anime is a major way for Bandai to market the game prior to release. It being delayed to the fall season will severely limit their marketing. ~~It also makes me wonder why Bandai didn't choose Sunrise to do God Eater since they own that studio. They probably thought Ufotable's style was a better fit but I bet some of them are thinking right now that they should've went with Sunrise.~~ Forgot that Ufotable worked on the God Eater games and a bunch of Bandai games and that's why they were hired. 




 Doubt it. Ufotable strikes me as a studio that would only take projects with a good budget to maintain their high standard of art and animation. They just don't seem to have much experience with juggling multiple series since they usually only make one per year. I'm guessing that inexperience with schedule constraints is what causing the production problems. 









 Digital Frontier is doing the CG. They did the CG for Resident Evil: Damnation. They also did the CG sections in Wolf Children including the [snow scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGWzwpVBZSE)

Resident Evil: Damnation action scenes:

[Ada Wong VS Svetlana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzPdR1bRtBw)

[Tyrant fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH_JcpyoVho)

Those looked pretty good to me but then again anime series production compared to film production is a different story in terms of budget and time management. That difference being budget and time are more constrained in TV anime production.

To me the more interesting part of this announcement is Digital Frontier possibly doing more CG anime series production. A competition between them and Polygon is good for advancing the tech in CG anime. 









 I would totally watch a spin-off with Knuckle and his [percussion harem](http://i.imgur.com/wMn20CC.jpg).

 Solid 2nd season but not as good as the first which had more tension and better sense of eminent danger. I also would have liked if we got information on the gaunas; their origin and why they're attacking humans. Some details on Ochiai's use of gauna biology to make his come back would've been nice too.

As for the finale, the continuation of the battle was a bit underwhelming compared to the last episode. Maybe the finale would have been better off as being purely a resolution episode. That would also mean condensing all the battle in the 11th episode, which I would not have liked.

The orbital bombardment sequence was absolutely badass and the sound design was glorious.

[Bombardment sequence](https://streamable.com/1c19)
 









 Dunno. The disk sales per volume are down by 2,000 from the first season. If the producers don't want to do a third season maybe netflix will pick it up since they'll be launching in Japan soon and might want some new content for that audience. 




 Haha. Never seen someone gain fans with his performance then lose them immediately with a post fight speech. 














 Hopefully Tanaka and Pineda can get out of their slump soon.

 A natural 220 pounder would be considered a small heavyweight and would rather cut 15 lbs to make LHW. A 200 pounder would cut 15 lbs to make MW instead of fighting 220 pounders cutting down to LHW. Some of these fighters have no choice but to cut weight in double digits since the difference in weight divisions is large. 




 https://youtu.be/tfr5iaEE9bQ 




 Weight cuts are unavoidable when anything above lightweight have 15-20 lbs between divisions. Some fighters just naturally fall in between and they would rather cut down than fight bigger guys.

 Shinpachi's straight-man routine was on point this episode when he was describing Tsukuyo and Sa-chan.

Sorachi just went all "gender is a social construct" with that Gintoki-Kyubei dialogue.
