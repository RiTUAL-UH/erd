 Good to hear!   




 It's a pretty interesting AMA about starting your own chemistry startup.

Post your questions here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3e26al/american_chemical_society_ama_we_are_amy/ 




 This is a great AMA in AskHistorians, a great subreddit, we mods wanted to give our readers a chance to see it and ask questions. 









 One of the inhibitors I feel when thinking of starting a business of my own is my age (I'm 40), I feel like the ramp up of a business would take too long to pay off relative to my rather good paying job.  How long has it taken you to get your businesses self-sufficient?  (I believe they call this "crossing the valley of death.")

 yup! 




 We should be able to respond to users without our usernames being visible.  We can send messages from the subreddit, but we can't respond to modmail this way. If you're explaining the official stance of the subreddit to a hostile user I don't see why your username is important. (The number of users who argue that the rules should not apply to them is too damn high!) It's just a way for users better target individual mods.  




 I agree, actually, the admins need to actually do something, most of the time there is just no response.  having a fully open mod log would allow bad actors to laser focus on the person who just enforced a rule.  This already happens way too much.  If you respond to a mod mail to explain why something was removed, even though you didn't do the removal, you can end up being comment stalked, and doxxed. 

I think there is a disconnect because users don't see the incredibly hostile messages the mods of big subreddits constantly get.  We have constant reminders of how terrible people can be.

 Wicking is a balance between gravity (the density of the fluid) and the surface adhesion of for the wick.  Trees are essentially ground water wicks that bring water to their leaves. Since water has a high affinity for cellulose, trees can grow quite tall!  But that's not your question.

If we are looking for an unwickable liquid, we would want high weight, and strong cohesive forces.  Off the top of my head, mercury fits this.  Mercury will spread out on certain metal surfaces, like aluminum, but it is actually dissolving the metal in the process, which would make for a poor wick!  It doesn't spread on normally found materials like wood, or plastic or glass.

Another possibility would be fluorocarbons, since they tend to repel both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces.

 How do you suggest dealing with the very real problem of mod stalking/death threats?  




 And when the admins are overwhelmed and they don't do, what happens then?  Because that will be the first couple of hours.  You can't rely on the admins for even the simplest of things history has shown, this is just a fact now. 




 I agree, and adding the line "in video games" would be unlikely to reduce the popularity of the post, while being more accurate and not misleading the reader about the scope of the study.  Too many readers don't look at the article at all, they just take the headline as a fact. 




 See the comments, it was reported as such by another mod.

 I think we really do need to be header on the psychology publications, they evoke way too much drama given the supporting information. 




 We believe it should have included a subject area, instead of generalizing to the whole populace.  The headline of the linked article is the sensationalized bit.
 




 Yeah, it's not your fault, we're just trying to figure out where the line is on these headlines.  




 Well, this was the point of the new rules, I should have been quicker at removing it.

 It was a trivial critique of the methodology, one that is maybe meaningful to the inexperienced (hence the votes) but noise to people who do this for a living.

 It's the little tags next to the post headlines or occasionally a username. 




 We have too many people removing things for that to be feasible, which is why we need the rules to be as specific as possible. 




 Would not be removed automatically because it isn't "invented by a" 




 Sorry, left out a word, that's what I get for typing on a phone while a 3 year old attacks me! 




 My subreddit is /r/science, we have a couple of custom bots in addition to automod, and our custom moderation set up.  We just have one of the most strictly moderated subreddit, in addition to one of the largest. 




 We can, and we'll watch things.  

We're not completely clamping down on headlines, just taking a harder line on things. 




 We would like the traffic from our subreddit to encourage quality science journalism, not sensational headline engineering. 




 There are plenty of other words, we're just picking out one that has been abused in the past.  Right now it's just "invented by a"  that specific phrase. 




 of course. 




 It's an interesting idea, but it would be hard for users without a great deal of educational background to do.   




 Poor communication.  We ask the admins if this is a ban evader, because we can't tell, and then we don't get a response.

 In practice, this is not true.  Different mods remove different comments and ban different accounts. In a subreddit that makes little attempt to moderate comments it might be possible, but we had  close to 40,000 mod actions in the last month. 




 Peer-reviewed journal article appear in print and therefore don't have video associated with them, so the odds of missing something is low. 




 Mod of /r/science here, and actually, that was on our list of complaints.  We get a response from the admins maybe 1/5 messages.  
 




 How do we tell if they have evaded the ban or if they are just another shit head user?   




 That is how we use it, if it is just a little off, we tag, if it misrepresents, it's removed.   




 Report any comments that say that, and we'll remove them.  Our mod team is reasonably effective, it may be less common than you are recalling (confirmation bias and all that.) 

We could set up "correlation" to trigger and auto-report to the mods. 




 We will try to do this, we don't tag things as misleading that often. 




 oh, we'll look at some examples and see, it might be on the blocks... 




 Sad to say, we don't get many computer science articles.   




 The flair would show 'Misleading, see comm...]  the character limit is annoying.  




 The issues of a default are well known, and /r/science is the oldest default. 




 Must be early on-set mental degeneration.  I'll probably be wearing adult diapers in six months. 




 Ugly work around, but welcome to the world of being a mod on reddit, where you don't get even simple tools. 




 I'm not concerned about karma personally, I have never sought it (as you can tell by my relatively low karma for a 7 yr old account.) If we had a mod abusing sticky comments for that purpose we would remove them as mods. 




 That would be fine, just don't call it out as a video in the title. 




 Pessimist! 




 We have been asking for the ability to make sticky comments for literally years, this is part of the blackout motivations. 




 In this case, yes.  Scientific publications don't say "invented by" so it's pretty easy to make that rule. 




 You didn't even try to read the post, did you? 




 We'd rather them reach the front page for the right reasons- meaningful research - rather than a sensationalized headline. 




 Videos are not allowed because of experience, while there might be some good ones, a vast majority are just fluff.  It was allowed for years, but it just became a problem.   




 I can't imagine a post with an equation in the title that isn't a bit off. 




 um...yeah. :-) 




 True, but "by a" might be too broad for an auto-remove. 




 Things are far from perfect, we are still trying to figure out a good way to address things, if you have ideas, please let us know! 




 We can't make flair a link, unfortunately, it's a limitation of reddit.  Good idea though!

We can try to make a post though, that should be doable, but the issue there is we have no way of making that post visible, it would likely be buried. 




 It's easy to accidentally say something that an expert in the field finds misleading. 




 We discussed it with user groups for a while, and now we're open to suggestions to improve our policies.  




 Maybe we should add "invented by a" to the removal phrases, I doubt I've ever seen that in a non-sensationalized title. 




 Sure, or just send an email to sciencereddit@gmail.com 




 Thanks, it's back out. 




 This is a on-going issue, a big part of the problem is people who aren't experts in an area would make misleading headlines and never know it.  Not an easy thing to police. 




 We'll make an exception, simple.  I doubt we'll have to make many of those.

 We hate it as much as you, it's just been difficult to define, and we want to be as unbiased as possible. 




 Seems to be a cut and dry rule. We don't see it much, but it is worth explicitly saying.

 Hi everyone,

A constant complaint we've had is the sensationalism of headlines, we've discussed the issue, and we're going to start enforcing some new rules for headlines.
 In addition to the [existing rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_submission_rules), we're adding these.

**Headlines may not:**

  - **ask a question** (anything with a '?') Linked articles which have a question in the title should be re-written to describe the content of the paper in keeping with our existing rules against editorializing and sensationalizing.

  - **make claims of resolving a long standing issue/cure/mystery.**

  -  **use an exclamation point.**

  - **makes general statements about large groups** (e.g. "men don't trust women", "Doctors hate him") The headline should indicate the group that the finding applies to.

  - **have a list mentioned.** (e.g. top 10 things you must read)

  - **makes reference to the thoughts or feelings of the reader.**  (e.g. "You'll never expect this")

  - **contain the word "[Video]" or related terms** (since we don't allow videos, linking to a page that contains a video is not allowed.)


**All Submission must have flair assigned**

The mods have been assigning appropriate flair to unflaired submissions, but we are no longer going to do this.  Unflaired submissions will be removed.  There will be 5 minutes of time to flair a post, after which it will be subject to removal, with notification.

If you have additional thoughts on how to make more specific headline rules or add rules, we'd like to hear them.  We will be testing things out and we may make changes as needed. 

Thanks!
