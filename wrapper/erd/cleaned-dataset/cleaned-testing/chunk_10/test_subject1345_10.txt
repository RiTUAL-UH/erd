 So many unwanted Smith fadeaways. 




 Hey guys, Celtics fan here pulling hard for the Rockets to win it all. Huge Harden fan. I'm wondering if anybody has a stat of how many total mid range jumpers the Rockets took during the regular season. I know they don't take many, even less before Josh Smith, but if anybody has the total that'd be sweet. Go Rockets! 




 Well he got 2 tonight so maybe he'll be able to scrape together some AB's. I agree with you though 




 I mean he'll get pinch hits and an occasional day but I'm afraid he's gonna lose his swing or something 




 Yeah you're probably right. Oh well.  




 I guess that's true. You make a valid point 




 but he's just watching. he's not going to get any playing time with our core back and healthy and playing so well, I would just rather him stay hot and keep hitting. 




 I just think I'd rather have him getting everyday at bats instead of sitting on our bench with Clint Robinson and Danny. I'd rather him getting the consistent at bats even if it is against AAA pitchers. What do you guys think? 




 Why can't Carpenter be good against everyone but us. Curse you fantasy... 




 I can only assume "cash" means we're getting [this guy.](http://www.korkedbats.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/LLWS-Pics-Cash-Money-2.jpg)
