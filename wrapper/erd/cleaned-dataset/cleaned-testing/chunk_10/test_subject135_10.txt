 It sounds like you should seek professional help. Also, you might want to break up with your boyfriend. You've been together since you were 15, so unless your intention is to stay together forever, get out now so that you can explore your inner self, your wants and your needs by yourself while you're still young. 




 But the Fantastic Mr. Fox says dogs like blueberries. Or is that only beagles? 




 I looked some more. Maybe this? 

http://anybencher.com/bencher/siddurim/weekday-siddur-454 




 I have a tiny weekday one that I got from a bar mitzvah. I can't believe I can't find a picture of something like it online. It's about 4.5 x 3 x .25.

 









 Lately I've been doing [this](http://yogaone.com/index.php) one that says it's Hatha, and [this](http://www.happyyoga.tv/) one that doesn't say.  




 They should be certified as yoga instructors. I don't know if they all are, though. 




 There may be more languages that are even more difficult than German, but that doesn't make German "fairly easy." I'd say French is "fairly easy." It may have a million tenses but it's all very straightforward. I don't get how you're supposed to understand a German sentence the first time around when the "nicht" is at the end. It's like, blah blah blah NOT! Ha, ha, tricked you! 




 Yoga isn't PE class. Plank is strenuous. I've recently been doing two different classes on video and even the hard one that had crow pose (I didn't even bother trying it) hasn't done plank yet. 




 Also what's your definition of ruin someone's life?

Being fired from your job, losing all your friend, family and partner, and being homeless. It doesn't sound like he had a job, it doesn't sound like he lost his partner, though yes, he was estranged from his family who he lived 2,000 miles away from in the first place. And it doesn't sound like he was ever homeless. 




 I've been doing yoga on and off for 15 years and things like plank and "hog tie" are not standard, and neither is a 75-minute class. The one difficult pose that I've found to be standard is down dog. Fifteen years and I still can't do it well. 









 A beginner should go to a beginner's class where they show you proper positioning and alternate versions if you aren't as flexible. OP should not have gone to this class. 




 Funny, but: How did he remember all these poses and how well he did them? Did he take notes? Also, sounds like he went to an intermediate or advanced class. Obviously not appropriate for someone who's never done yoga before. He didn't fuck up as much as his GF did by bringing him to this class since there's no such thing as fucking up in yoga. Yoga is non-competitive. You do the best you can and that's all that matters. 




 It's not without its flaws and you have to push past the first 85 pages to get to the meat of the story, but this seems like the kind of book many Redditors would like so I decided to recommend it. Larson's first book The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet was better.

Here's a positive review of the book: http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/i-am-radar-by-reif-larsen/2015/04/09/77a75312-d6f5-11e4-ba28-f2a685dc7f89_story.html 




 Not really. The Wikipedia article is vague and in fact, seems like it might be purposefully evasive about the fact that he was already on disability. 

OP's headline is just misleading all around. The media didn't out him, Harvey Milk did, and it's not clear that it ruined his life as much as exacerbated problems that he already had. 




 From the article you cited:

Sipple's relatives in Detroit said the publicity shattered the Vietnam veteran, who had a history of hypertension and heart problems that led to a medical discharge from the service. He lived on a disability pension.

Sounds to me like it exacerbated problems that he already had. But either way, what you say you learned is supposed to be in the source you cited. OP did not cite this article. 




 I see no evidence in this Wikipedia page of any direct connection between Sipple's decline and being outed. This doesn't remotely say that being outed ruined his life.

Sipple's mental and physical health sharply declined over the years. He drank heavily, gained weight to 300 lb (140 kg), was fitted with a pacemaker, and became paranoid and suicidal. The incident brought him so much attention that, later in life, while drinking, he would express regret towards grabbing Moore's gun. Sipple, who was wounded in the head in Vietnam, was also diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic according to the coroner's report. 




 This is what windshield screen covers are for.  




 Bought chocolate for my neighbor.

Not entirely sure this counts as a good deed, but at least it's something I did for somebody else. If you'd have asked this yesterday the answer would have been "nothing." 




 Maybe: La Marseillaise, Au clair de la lune, and Frere Jacques. 




 huge crowds of people on it constantly

I keep forgetting it's the summer. Maybe I'll tell them this isn't a good idea. Too crowded. 




  Some restaurants and touristy places are less accessible and might be narrow with tight corners.

That's what I was a little afraid of, considering that lots of these places are historic buildings, not exactly built to ADA standards. But I'm asking for my parents and if the attraction was relatively small they should be able to leave the scooters outside. 




  Are there any specific places you want to go so I can give you more useful answers?

I'm asking for my parents and they haven't looked into an itinerary yet. I thought they might like the Freedom Trail, but it's been a while since I was in Boston and I can't remember what else I saw there.  




 No, it was a recently published book. 




 No, it had an orange (or maybe red) cover with a few black and white stripes. The eye was a drawing, not a person's eye. 

(I think.) 




 It was a self-published book only available on this guy's website, which is now defunct. And frankly, it sounds like a scam anyway, so you're not missing anything. 




 I think it was by a woman. It was not related to the Illuminati.

I found it: The Ghost Network by Catie Disabato.

http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22889883-the-ghost-network

I had it on hold at the library and they canceled my hold. Now I'm at the end of the list again. Idiots.  









 I lost out on two apartments to people offering cash. Both were over $500k.

My first guess was that it's criminals looking to launder money. My second guess was it's people looking for an investment and plan to rent out the apartment. Both of which suck. I cannot think of any possible scenario where the people don't suck. 




 Which is what?  




 Cotton, in particular, is absorbent, so it absorbs the sweat from your body, making you feel cooler. Polyester isn't absorbent so you stay bathed in your sweat, making you feel hotter.  




 First off, where you gain and lose fat from is genetic. Second, the weight tends to be gained or lost from large chunks of your body at a time. So some people will lose it first from the top, some from the middle, and some from the bottom. It's not possible to lose weight in one arm and not other.

It is possible to only work out one arm and not the other and then yes, one arm will be developed and muscular and the other won't be. 




 I don't see any reason why you can't call them. The organization may be Christian but anybody can volunteer for the hotline and they're not going to try to convert you. 




 Friday night I abandoned Selfish: Sixteen Writers on the Decision Not to Have Kids edited by Meghan Daum. I don't have kids, I don't want kids, but I found this book depressing. 

Yesterday abandoned Rain on the Dead by Jack Higgins. I'm just so sick of his Sean Dillon books. They're too formulaic and shallow. Not reading Higgins ever again unless it's about something other than Dillon and friends. 




 I would go to Amazon or Goodreads and read them whatever description it has there.  




 It might be better if they hid them the way they hide unhelpful comments in responses to the reviews. But you can't remove them because that would also remove the star rating they gave and it's misleading if you removed a lot of the one and two star reviews just because the people couldn't come up with a cogent reason for disliking the book. They represent all the people that think like them. And believe me, if one person has a certain opinion, it's guaranteed that other people do too. 




 I'll pencil him in for around 4.  




  Saturday, September 12, 2015.

I thought Moshiach can't come on Shabbos?

But either way, that date works for me. I'll be ready and waiting. 




 On my reading stack for tonight: 

- Selfish: Sixteen Writers on the Decision Not to Have Kids edited by Meghan Daum

- Burn by James Patterson and Michael Ledwidge 




 Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. ;)

Happy 4th! 




 I'd rather not vilify the guy without more information. OP's post doesn't indicate that he does this with anything else but food. 




 I don't think he's being inconsiderate as much as he's being hungry. As long as he's not gaining weight, he can eat as much as he wants (within reason). And if there isn't enough food for two people it means they're not buying enough food to begin with. So like you said, buy more food. 




 My feeling is that it's a kind of hypercorrection. Like, teachers tell you not to say "me and him," but instead "he and I," so some people have a tendency to say "he and I" even when it's wrong.

In American English we tend to soften words with T's in them: butter become budder, metal becomes medal. So some people are hypercorrecting all T words to into D words even though that's not how Americans typically pronounce those words.

I've heard it in the New York metro area. I don't know if this is a country-wide thing. 




 Sometimes I like to call a puddle a "poodle." 









 I wasn't sure what you were getting at since I tend to doubt this is the case.  




 That would mean they know each other.  




  One is not allowed to undergo any intentionally sterilizing surgery or procedure, including SRS and hormone replacement.

Many trans people don't undergo surgery and hormones don't necessarily make you sterile. There was that transman that had a baby for pete's sake. 

To me, if you're having a baby, you're not a man. You just can't have it both ways. 




 Goes all the way back to the ancient Romans.

 men kill for sex, while women kill for money

And where do angels of mercy fall into this scheme? Especially considering that they are of both genders.  




 I got it right because I assumed it was trying to trick me and therefore the simplest explanation couldn't possibly be the right one. I kept testing various possibilities to make sure I hadn't missed anything. I am the 9%!

Trying to bring this into politics and business seemed like a bit of a stretch, though.  




 The EPA regulates pesticide usage. Here's the law (PDF doc): http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/regulating/fifra.pdf 




 Israel annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights only; the Golan Heights was never part of the partition plan, it was part of Syria. Israel offered to give it back in exchange for a peace agreement. The offer was rejected. Gaza and the West Bank were never annexed. 




 Source that misusing mothballs is a federal crime?

I see articles about it being a state violation for misuse of a pesticide. Pesticides are poison and can be harmful to humans and domestic or protected animals if misused. 




 The title is clickbait. Amazon wouldn't say how they arrived at the conclusion that the blog writer knows the author she's reviewing. It's highly unlikely that they won't let you review an author whose Twitter you follow. 

Now, Amazon could very easily be mistaken, but considering the blog author won't name the book she wanted to review, it's a he-said/she-said situation because neither side can be verified by someone on the outside. 




 This is a picture of a shrimp farm: http://www.fishfarming.com/sites/default/files/Finca-Camaronera-de-C.I.-OCEANOS_panaraimio.jpg

The problem is that it's similar but not exactly the same and it's certainly not blue. 

Maybe try /r/whatisthisthing. 




 Not that -- the lighting on the cat looks different than in the rest of the picture. 




 So I'm the only person that thinks this picture looks fake, then? 




 /r/writing

But, don't put the cart before the horse. If the book isn't written yet, getting a publisher should be the last thing on your mind. 




 I didn't say hers were fake, I said the way you get breasts like that is either by being lucky enough to have good genes or by buying them; wearing a bra or not doesn't make any difference unless the breasts are fairly small. 




 This is true, but only for small breasts. 

Breasts like the white woman has are either genetic or fake, helped along by the fact that she's relatively young, and quite thin. 

Edit: word 




 Fat suits are usually pretty offensive but the difference is that there isn't a long history of anti-fat entertainment and slavery of fat people.

As for CGI dwarves, I don't know what you're referring to. 




 It's both. 




  Considering the absence of other animal welfare laws in there

There are definitely other animal welfare laws. For example, animal cruelty is forbidden and you must feed your animal before you feed yourself. 




  Deuteronomy, for instance, says that animals with divided hoofs or that chew the cud can be eaten; but it also forbids camels from being eaten

Not or -- and. They have to chew their cud and have split hooves. This is why camels, pigs, hares and hyraxes are forbidden.  




 My friend told me my mom was cool because she used the word "ergo." So... my mom is special because she has a good vocabulary and she isn't afraid to use it. 




 There is no logic behind it. It's just a cultural fad. Here's a portrait of a man with long hair from the mid-17th century: http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/man-with-black-bows-by-sebastien-bourdon-oil-on-canvas-stock-graphic/149319874

 I accidentally left some of my groceries at my parents' house and now I have to buy more to replace them because we live too far away from each for me to just pop over and pick up my stuff. I'm so angry at myself right now.  




 Exercise doesn't have to be strenuous to make you feel good. I did a pretty mild yoga routine yesterday and I felt so good afterwards because I'm often tense and my muscles are tight, so relaxing and loosening them was great. 




 Where did you see this? It makes me think of algae/shrimp farms. 




 You're right that it amounted to an occupation, but when you use that word, people who don't understand the situation probably imagine it's like Red Dawn -- the commies marching in and taking over because, well, that's what commies do! Or even like the US using WMD as an excuse to march into Iraq and topple its dictator because oil, duh. 

What was missing from moussa's posts is the context of what happened. Lebanon had been involved in a civil war for a while before Israel got involved, not to mention the fact that Syria also was occupying the country. 

It was a very complicated situation and boiling it down to "it's all Israel's fault" is simply untrue and upvoting what he wrote is a demonstration of biased ignorance. 




 When you try to request a kit, it asks you to put in "date/time observed" and "description." What am I supposed to write? I haven't "observed" any lead, but maybe I suspect there is some in the pipes? 




 Huh. Thanks.  




 If by downtown you mean the Loop, neither of those restaurants are nearby and there are no Orthodox shuls there that have a Shabbos minyan. About a mile and a half north of the Loop is a Chabad house. 

There's a Loop listing on godaven.com that's misleading. It sounds Orthodox but it's actually "Traditional."

But however it works out, enjoy. I liked Chicago a lot. 




 20,000 is not a universally recognized number and the people that were killed were not targeted by anybody, they were just unfortunately there; their deaths are attributable to all the forces that were fighting, not just Israel.

According to American military analyst Richard Gabriel, all factions in the conflicts agree that between 4,000 and 5,000 civilians died during the siege caused by military activity of all sides. He states that most of the observers that were present of the ground and other relevant sources in Lebanon agree that estimates of 8,000 - 10,000 are too high.[91] 




 And I'm sick of ignorant people who have no idea of what the true history of the area is, bringing Israel into an unrelated discussion about half-naked ladies protesting the extremists in their own religion. As someone else mentioned above, a Muslim group bombing marines barracks was what put Beirut on the map for most Americans as a dangerous place. 




 What you wrote completely misrepresented the situation. In the fight against the PLO, Israel pushed into Lebanon, laid siege to Beirut, held the area for less than a year and later held onto a small piece of land at the border between Israel and Lebanon in conjunction with the Lebanese militia group the South Lebanese Army. This is what Hezbollah was formed to fight: Israel and its Lebanese allies.  




 Israel never occupied Lebanon. It held a small bit of land at the border in conjunction with the South Lebanon Army as part of their fight against the PLO.

 I'm not saying it's aliens.... but it's aliens.

But seriously, without a picture and location it's impossible to say for sure what it is you've seen. 




 It's not just music that grows on you, it's anything at all that you haven't experienced before. People tend to dislike new things but once they get used to them and they don't feel new anymore, they usually like them more. That's why, for example, they suggest you try a new food ten times before deciding you don't like it. 




 Also, dogs and cats are like perpetual babies -- you either have to walk them and pick up their poop or you have to clean out their litter box. Some people aren't interested in doing either of those things. Even a fish in a fancy tank doesn't entirely take care of itself. 

So a pet is a responsibility that not everybody's interested in taking on. 




 To properly judge you need to have studied the art and history of fashion. That way you can tell if something is original or derivative; is it using color, shape, and fabric in a creative way; does it reflect the times we live in; etc. It's no different than being able to judge any other art form. Obviously if you know nothing about fashion you can look at it and say, "That looks ridiculous," but it's a worthless opinion. 




 Honestly, I believe it's a lack of having anything interesting to say about the human condition as well as a general lack of creativity. Sure the Beatles have a lot of songs about love, but they also have a song about a dude who aspires to write paperback books. A song about living in a yellow submarine. A song about a girl in the sky. A song about a street.

You can write a song about anything if you have something to say and an interesting way of saying it. Most writers don't so they fall back on an easy subject: love. 




 While societal pressure contributes to things like anorexia and bulimia, as someone said above, it's still a mental disorder. It's kind of like how society says that washing your hands is important, but a person with OCD who washes their hands 20 times in a row has a problem.  




 Most first world deaths are not caused by illnesses that your immune system plays any part in fighting. They are heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. You can have all of these problems and if you didn't go to the doctor you could very easily just fall down and die one day without ever having known you were sick.  




 Yes.  




 This is irrelevant except to point out that it's not mostly Vietnamese, at least not in NYC. 




 This is an interesting article which suggests that before the flood people really did live that long.

https://answersingenesis.org/bible-timeline/genealogy/did-adam-and-noah-really-live-over-900-years/

Edit: OP asked a question in terms of if you believe the Bible is true. Gets downvoted for providing that answer.  




 In case the question didn't make any sense: Why is it that a lot of apartments in my area have dishwashers but don't allow washing machines? Are they very different in terms of how much water and power they use or is it something else?  




 I'm not comparing them to myself, I'm comparing them to people who are attractive, say, young Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. They were smoking hot.  




 I thought she was bad in that. And miscast too.  




 Not always. It's hard to find someone attractive if you can't remember what they look like because their face is so generic. 




 I do it to avoid stepping in the dog poop. 




 I've never liked Jennifer Lawrence. She can't act and isn't pretty. I'm not sure Chris Pratt can act either, but at least watching him is fun. I'm also undecided if he's actually good-looking or just attractive in a generic sort of way. 




 Please. I'm a comment karma courtesan.

 Sure, but "contaminated" is a loaded word so I don't think it's a good one to use in this context. 




 I would think they are. Things that you "know" usually don't count for much in Judaism if they can't be materially proven. 




 The way that you prove that your family is Jewish is usually through marriage records so if they were able to have a Jewish wedding, I guess that's all that really matters. I'm not sure that it's about practicing as much as throwing your lot in with the Jewish people.

Edited: More accurate wording. 




 If a family practices Judaism for three (or four) generations they're considered Jewish and nothing before that matters.

 What? Above you said Goebbels would sound like Gerbbels, not Gorbbels. 

Goethe sounds like Gerta. I see no evidence that this pronunciation only came about during WWII. 




 I was answering your question about whether pork is considered contamination or not. 




 Considering people were talking about Goethe before Goebbels was even born, I'm going to have to assume that this is a joke answer. 




 Potatoes are not bad for you. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber and are not like eating bread. 




 First, nobody thinks of it as being "contamination." Second, even if they did, it would be of a spiritual sort, not a physical one.  




 Whoever told you this is very much mistaken. 









 In my opinion, an Orthodox education or an extremely rigorous Conservative one, assuming such a thing exists.  




 IIRC you do have to have some sort of intention. If you meant to eat non-kosher but accidentally ate kosher instead, that's still considered a sin.  




 Assuming you grew up without a Jewish education, you're considered a "tinok shenishba" and cannot be blamed for not believing, which means that most Jews you encounter will not care and the ones that do look down on you are the kind of people that look down on everyone, so it's not personal.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinok_shenishba 




  Many women wear pants, don't cover their hair, and my sources tell me that apparently premarital sex is a thing

None of these things make a person Conservative (or Conservadox) in any way.  




 The fact is, this is no worse than the process most employers use now. It's been shown time and again that unstructured interviews do not result in the hiring of the best candidate.

  Can you actually name your son "Loser" in US?

Yes, you can, especially since it's a German last name and therefore  might be used as someone's first name, and is a Jewish nickname for the Biblical name Elazar.

 It's an emotionally persuasive way of speaking because Christianity emphasizes faith in Jesus, as compared to the way that a rabbi might give a sermon in a straightforward tone, which is meant to be intellectually appealing, because Judaism emphasizes learning about the religion.

I don't know if they learn it in "preacher school" but certainly they learn it from listening to other preachers speak that way.

 It's not about ignoring it, it's about facing the reality if a man is afraid of being raped, statistically he has a lot more to fear from another man than from a woman.
