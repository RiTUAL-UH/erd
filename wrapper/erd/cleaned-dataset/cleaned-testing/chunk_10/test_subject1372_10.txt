 1.0 was considered a beta. It was pretty damn stable as far as random crashes go. But there was nothing horribly janky about the software. This was before the gamecube 3 frame delay was removed, before replays desynced, before lightpresses were put in, before individual input was a thing, before a lot of things. There were only 14 characters too. I believe Lucas, Sonic, Snake, and Falco were all in there, but I forget who else. It wasn't a very huge bunch, so it wasn't very popular for tournament play either. 




 This post has been removed because the linked compilation does not credit the viners who made the vines. 




 I would chalk it up to the NX being announced, not the Wii U's limitations. They probably just don't think the game will sell. Racer's are the easiest fucking thing and least limited thing to make when you think about how basic the programming must be and how the game doesn't even have to look that good since you're going by everything too fast to pay attention. 




 "Don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes, or I'm telling mom!" 




 A lot of drama is added to the TV show's duels which creates turns that last 3-5 minutes especially when you consider each card effect is explained no matter how many times it's already been used. The writers are assuming there are going to be people who watch that episode as their first episode.

But our turns can actually go pretty quickly, and we deal up to a full 8k life points in a single turn. For us, it's desired. The TV show still lengthens duels by having damage be limited to about 200-1500 per turn most of the time. Not to mention, the TV show is very dramatized so those 3-5 minutes turns get stretched even further. 




 I got into it first. 




 I asked my mom to tell me a story from when I was young.

 Son, when you were young. You'd be all over the place. I couldn't keep you from running up and down the stairs. You couldn't decide if you wanted to be up or down, I couldn't keep up with ya. And I didn't really want to try. Oh, and how hungry you were. You were always asking for little snacks before dinner time. Most of the time I'd feed you an apple. And you calmed down. Before you were 7 you kept saying Apples are your favorite food in the entire universe. Those were your words. "Apples are my favorite food in the entire universe." That was until you discovered mushroom pizza. You'd start looking for mushroom pizza every time we ordered it. Sometimes you would get so sad when you didn't see any. You had to settle for pepperoni or plain cheese.

 But I digress. That's just when you were young and what you were like. One day, we went to an amusement park, and you kept trying to run ahead to play games and get on rides. I kept asking you to slow down, but you were so excited when you learned you could go on as many rides as you wanted for free. Didn't cost any money or tickets. So you wanted to ride on every roller coaster.

 I loved that joy in you. How you were always happy to spend time with me.

I asked my dad to tell me a story from when I was young.

 There isn't a lot of anything exciting to tell. You were pretty quit when you were with me. Your older siblings always asked for things from me and you just sort of asked for a slurpee or something every now and then. Even when I'd try to figure out thins about you like your favorite food or color. Wasn't until you were 8 I learned your favorite food was apples.

 I never really saw you running. It seemed like you wanted to play with everyone around you but you got quit when I walked in. Like you were saying bad words and you had to stop talking in front of me. But you weren't saying anything bad. I know, I listened from around the corner. I had to ask questions to get you to talk to me. But, even when I asked what you want on your pizza you would just say nothing. Same with burgers. I'd get you a burger and you'd just want it plain.

 I kept asking your mom how to get through to you. She kept saying to give you things to do. Don't let you be bored.

When I was four, I asked my mom about a purple spot on her face.

 Ask your father.

I did ask my dad. I became ten dollars richer not to talk about it.

No wonder my parents are divorced.

 That's better. I'll update your info right now. 




 I'd really like a feature like this as well. I've even googled for it, but I've found nothing. 




 I just got it all updated. In the future, if you need a flair update, just let the mods know along with a link to your feedback thread. 




 1. You don't have any historical feedback. Historical feedback is NOT feedback from previous threads. That should be labeled as Previous Thread.

2. That thread is archived. Leave a link when you make a new one. 




 I got you updated. 




 Please tell me this is all real. I love the melee aesthetics more than brawl's.

Edit: Yay. It's real. I'll be using this as a basis for my builds!!! but, I think the general consensus is that the toon link textures are a fucking tragedy. 




 I've woken up at 8 just to spend until 1 in the afternoon just dealing with mod mail. Just a few clicks, my ass. 




 Who gets rid of the shits that troll and ruin good discussion? Who gets rid of horrible duplicate threads and cuts down on clutter? Who moved trading and selling to other subreddits to give discussion a spotlight on the main sub? Thank your fucking mods. 




 "I'm racist. You should be too. Close the borders." 




 Throw him under a bridge! Woot woot. Based mods. Kappa. 




 A bit of drama? Let's watch boys and girls.

Caineghest is an awesome mod btw. 




 Sometimes I have to be a real dick to get a point across. I don't think I'll want to mod here until the rest of my mod places are good. I gracefully neglected ygofeedback for a while and now we're very behind on setting up threads and flairs.

The current mods are doing very well. Maybe I'll apply if they ever need more. But for now, I like having my hands ful with what I have. I love Yu-Gi-Oh! And modding around has been a result of getting back into the game.

Yu-Gi-Oh! Modding and Smash Bros are basically my hobbies now. 




 Your landlord doesn't do anything for you for free. He takes your money.

Apples to oranges. 




 The community was once tearing each other apart and posting the most random shit that still managed to get invited to the front. The mods put a lot of work not only in making this place look nice and organizing content with the side bar, they weeded shit out and got binders and trades their own subreddits so the constant complaining about this being "binder subreddit".

You're fucking welcome. 




 I imagine that the mods of /r/Yu-Gi-Oh! Work a lot harder than I do. I don't care so much about the thanks. I run the subs that I do because I love the game. I'm asking everyone to thank the main mods not me. If I didn't already look like an ass, here's a news flash. Go fuck yourself. I don't mod this sub, therefor I'm not asking for thank yous. I'm asking that everyone make sure /r/Yugioh has mods that don't go underappreciated.

 To make it clear, I don't moderate this subreddit. But, I'm a mod on /r/ygobinder, /r/ygosales, /r/yugioh101, /r/ygofeedback, /r/customyugioh, /r/vine, /r/complainaboutanything and more. And on top of deciding what content to leave in and weed out, they deal with rude users, users being rude to other users, deciding on a subreddit's style, implenting features and organizing discussion, and continuously updating the sidebar to reflect any and all changes in its organization.

They do it for free. They don't put up a donation button, they don't have experience to put on their resume, they don't start a patreon to keep it going. They do it for free.

I want to thank all of the other mods of this subreddit and the other yugioh subreddits. I can imagine that moderating this sub has to be a lot of work compared to the sister subreddits that handle far fewer users. It's like a garden. It doesn't go on pause because you don't feel like tending to it for one day. If you leave it alone for a few days, weeds start piling up, plants start withering, and users often get away with harassing each other and starting many duplicate threads. Just today I saw 2-3 threads trying to be the first to start a banlist discussion.

If a moderator helps you with anything, send them a thanks. When users start bugging you or bad and unwanted content starts propping up, be glad the mods are there to help keep quality up. While I still object to a lot of design choices (I'm a designer, sue me), this site looks great, feels fun, and is very well organized. I find it absolutely amazing how much work they have put in.

Sorry, but I just couldn't wait until the weekend free talk to post this. 




 Current Feedback and Total feedback mean the same thing. Current feedback doesn't mean current thread. 




 You do not have any historical feedback. Please list your historical feedback as "previous thread."

Do this by putting +11 from DN in brackets immediately followed by the link in parenthesis.

 Again, I repeat that **I don't want Reddit enhancement suite**. I hate that software to death. The only feature I actually liked was being able to see how my text would look before I posted. I'm looking to see if there's an extension like that.

 Well, family oriented has never actually been inherently kid-focused. We just think it does because we're used to people appealing to the lowest common denominator. But ABC Family is a family oriented television station with almost all of its shows appealing to ages 10-50. Hell, I watched Smallville when I was barely into my teenage years. Same for Gilmore Girls and a lot of other ABC Family shows. 




  Even your girlfriend who secretly fantasizes about smashing your xbox with a hammer is probably cool with nintendo

Totally unrelated, but my girlfriend is actually a huge gamer. She introduced me to Left 4 Dead and the Jak and Daxter series among other things. I think the only long-running thing I got her into was Metroid. She and I both have a Wii U of our own and she occasionally plays Xbox for fun on CoD or Left 4 Dead or Minecraft or whatever. But... guess which one she plays most. 




 This just goes to show that anyone who loves games but doesn't have a Wii U simply doesn't know what he or she is missing. 




 Well, they see the OCG as a test of what's truly good against one another, so when they figure out what's good, they see us as huge fucking dollar signs with making all the good shit expensive and hard to find. Sure Konami, they expect us to believe that bullshit of wanting every card available to every player. 




 Yeah, people have posted about this 5,000 times, so I don't know why this guy still got a lot of fucking karma. JUST VOTE ON THE LINKS YOU FUCKING CLICK. 




 If there's a shared computer somewhere around, an iPad will be enough. He can transfer things to the computer if he needs printing, or hook up to blue-tooth printing. If he's going into senior year, I'd say hold off and give him a laptop for Christmas maybe because he'll need a computer for the world. But if he's just a freshmen, fuck no he doesn't need his own computer. Even if you do get him one for Christmas, he doesn't need a Pro. Especially if he's just feeling entitled or needy. A $500 refurbished one from 3rd party is fine. My girlfriend has that and she's going into college soon. It works great for what she needs.

 Here is a song I wrote to honor Mr. Iwata's passing and in loving memory of his career.

 Your body goes through long cycles to wake up and go to sleep. If you're going back to sleep and have your alarm interrupt you while you're falling back asleep or barely asleep, it completely kills your body's mood. 

Imagine bouncing on a trampoline. To get high, you need to start off low and let gravity work with you so you can put more force on the trampoline and the trampoline gives back the force you put into it. And you can't just stop, you slowly start bouncing lower. So imagine you just stopped bouncing but you figured out you have thirty more minutes left to bounce. But once you start trying to jump high, the trampoline just tenses up and doesn't give you back any force and almost feels like solid ground. But... you were expecting to go through the entire cycle of bouncing higher and higher and higher. You still want to bounce higher, but the trampoline's timer said FUCK YOU and basically killed your happiness. It took away what you were looking forward to.

Sleep is somewhat the same way. When you start to go to sleep, your body looks forward to a certain amount of sleep, and when it doesn't get it, it keeps trying to go to sleep while you keep trying to stay awake. 




 Not that we want to play it in HD, because without a super powerful computer and an emulator and an adapter, PM will not be HD for real. Some of us just want to be able to play PM on Wii U because Wii U has much less lag with most flat screen TVs and it would take away the need to have a Wii *and* Wii U set up in a lot of households.

 "[This thing is happening] because of [thing that happened at this tournament]."

"[Insert card] shouldn't be banned. [deck it goes in] Isn't even doing anything right now, they need that card." This mostly applies to Stratos. Ever stop to think that maybe that fucking deck isn't doing anything because that ban-worthy card finally got hit?

"That card is totally getting banned."

"[this card] is gonna be OP, but [this other card] still needs to come out to make [this other deck] viable."

"Fucking hate YCS. Nothing but [cheaters/meta]"

Yeah, Yu-Gi-Oh Players say a lot of stupid and down-right retarded shit. 




 I've read that page. There doesn't seem to be anything in the way of a tutorial. I've got it somewhat figured out on my own, but there's more shit with error codes and not connecting even though the connection test was successful. 




 I'll let you know if those are still available after some other negotiations. 




 I'vve been using AR DSi and a bypass https code. That's not the problem. 




 Are there any good beginning to end tutorials on connecting to an alternate server. This is a retail game and I'm using a DSi game. I've gotten error code 52000, so I entered custom IP stuff and then it gave me error code 52100. I'm really not sure what's going wrong.

As is, my router is a Netgear, but it's using WPA so I'm using my iPhone to tether my DS to the router. If I try to change the WPA protection to WEP, I know of at least 5 people who will be pissed that their devices won't be able to connect. 




 I'm strapped for cash, and I really shouldn't be spending money on cards at all. Should be playing online for free like a poor man.

 I think NX articles should be banned from /r/Nintendo. So far every NX article has been "Nintendo seems to want to do [this]" or "Nintendo won't do [this] with the NX" according to some guy who isn't actually part of the project and is just speculating based on whatever. And, of course, we get the "The NX will need [this] if it wants to succeed" which mostly talk about how it better be a 3rd party whore or a straight-forward console with nothing but an ordinary controller. I just want to get it straight that Nintendo has not actually said anything about it other than it's an existing project. It's a fucking project. It's not a console yet. Right now, it's just an idea. Nothing is confirmed about the NX, and these articles are posting about it as if they have the insider on a console that's only months away from being announced.

Big news flash to the NX hypers: The NX can be anywhere from 2 to 6 to maybe even 8 years away. Right now, it's just a concept for Nintendo. I don't even think we were meant to know about it yet. Someone just slipped up and said a little too much, and now everybody can't stop fucking speculating on what they want the NX to be.

Let's ban nx articles from /r/nintendo and shut the fuck up about it until some REAL information is passed around. Right now, Nintendo needs our attention on the Wii U and the games coming to it. 









 "You wouldn't believe how uneventful this last hour has been." 




 And for my next trick, I will need a young female from the audience and about 9 months. 




 Exactly. I wish everyone would shut up about it. Nintendo doesn't even look like they wanted anyone to know. Something just happened to slip out and suddenly everyone is trying to predict it's release. NX could be 2 years away, or it could be 6. Time will tell. 




 I really wish we could all stop worrying about the NX and just let Nintendo do their thing. 




 If we have to give up backwards compatibility to get a beast-of-a-system, I kind of wouldn't mind. If they have the Wii U true backwards compatibility for GameCube titles, all I would need is a Wii U and whatever the NX will be. Oh, and my New 3DS but that's a minor technicality. 




 It's finally feeling like they have a new one. 




 Wow. It's unlike Microsoft to admit that their solution or software sucks. It's also unlike them to adopt any kind of standard. 




 Can we please get people to stop posting this? I've seen this a dozen times. It's old news. 




 "I am not having sex with you to keep my job." 




 Yeah, not sure what to say there. 




 I like this part about Nintendo. It's another thing I see as a difference between themselves and other companies. GTA 5 could have been GTA 15 since [it's the 15th game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(series)). The opening to Super Metroid admits to being Metroid 3 and Metroid Fusion says it's Metroid 4.

Mario Kart 7 could have just been named Mario Kart 2 and treated the rest of the games post Super Mario Kart as just spinoffs. This would have made Mario Kart 8 a Mario Kart 3 instead. And this would have pissed me off.

Why does it piss me off? I don't know, when other companies give their games the subtitle-spin-off treatment, it gets fans begging for that "give us game X". Like Kingdom Hearts fans begging for KH 3 when they've technically gotten much more than 3 games.

Naming conventions have never been nice in games. It sucks when every new game in a series is begging for confirmation on being a sequel or a prequel. And I guess at least I appreciate Nintendo's honesty with how many of a game they've released. (Except for Mario Party World Tour being the tenth Mario Party, not Mario Part 10).

Yeah, this is confusing. Yeah, I'm probably downvoted and banned for life, but I really just wanted to share this with someone. 




 "HO HO HO... MEEEERRY CHRISTMAS." 




 Lol. That's not even enough for 360x240. 




 I'm going to make this as detailed as possibly can so nobody here is confused and nobody can accuse me of being an idiot. So, as a prerequisite, 

* YES, I HAVE GOOGLED THIS. YES, 
* I HAVE TRIED THE SEARCH BAR OVER TO THE RIGHT. 
* YES, I HAVE TRIES TO CONTACT APPLE FOR HELP, BUT THEY ALWAYS MAKE ME CALL THEM AND I CANNOT TROUBLESHOOT WHILE ON THE PHONE.
* I keep iTunes updated.
* This happens whether or not my phone is jailbroken.

Okay, now that we got that out of the way, let me get into the details. To keep this simple, let's just say I have 10 albums each with 10 songs. Sometimes, when I re-sync my iTunes to my iPhone, I encounter errors on plenty of songs. Or just some songs. Or almost all songs.

Here is the error as simply as I can think to explain it. And it's in example form.

Album 1 Song 5 plays until about 25 seconds in. At that point, it skips to the next song. But, if I play that song and scrub to 26 seconds or later, the rest of the song plays as normal.

How do I know it's not just a random error with only my phone? I've had this happen on an iPhone 4, and 2 iPhone 5s models. My brother has also said that it has happened when he had a 5 and it happens now while he has a 6. That's 5 phones spanning 4 models, so I'm sure it's not just bad sections on my own phone causing the problem. Apps and documents seem to work perfectly without any errors that would be caused on bad parts of storage.

So I've troubleshooted that much. Now, I sync quite often since I get a lot of music, and I write songs and rearrange playlists that I want to update and sync to my phone. So, I try to delete that individual song and sync again to see if it will sync back on properly. ... the song doesn't sync back onto the phone unless I delete the entire album.

So, in the prior example, if I delete Album 1 Song 5 and re-sync, Album 1 Song 5 is still missing. But, if I had deleted all of Album 2 because they all had problems, Album 2 will be copied back onto my phone while Album 1 Song 5 is still missing.

I have reported this bug to Apple multiple times. Unfortunately, they've NEVER gotten back to me about the issue.

If anybody else is having this issue, I urge you to speak up. If there's a lot of people with this problem but no apparent fix for it, I'm planning to send this thread to Apple.

 "HEY, I LOVE YOU, GET THE FUCK OVER HERE." 




 Reddit. Nobody knows our slogan is "The front page of the Internet." 




 Same here. It makes it much easier. I still don't seem to be hitting any seeds correctly though, which sucks. I can't just get something I hatch/catch right away to match anything on the sheet. 




 I've never had to use l or r for keypresses. I know my buttons work though. They work in the other games I play. Thanks for the help.

I'll try to recalibrate and see if I can get results again. 




 I AM still trying to get used to Chatot pitches. I just read a guide about them, so I'm trying to get used to them. Now I have a chatter with a constant tone to help with it. 




 I'm using a 3DS, pokemon black, english version. Calibrated everything step by step according to multiple guides. But, what sucks is that even if I don't get that shiny I want, when I catch the pokemon and check it out, it doesn't seem to match anything on the spread, meaning I didn't even hit my goddamn seed.

I'm holding the keypressed it tells me to. I'm pressing A to launch the game 8 seconds prior to the seed time. And... strangely enough, in getting all of the parameters, the actual seconds seems to fluctuate between a 7 second difference and an 8 second difference. Everything from Vcount to timer0 to gxstat to vframe all stays the same. On BOTH machines that I've tested which is a standard 3DS and New 3DS XL. (Yes, I have different profiles for each one.)

I'm using *RNG Reporter 9.96.6 Alpha, XP compatible* and mostly following Titan's guide to 5th gen abuse for stationary pokemon. The kicker is I've twice gotten a shiny Cobolion with incredible stats. Got it twice actually, but the first time I couldn't catch it, so I did extra preparation and got it again.

Now I'm trying to do it for Terrakion. I'm using chatter the same way I always have. Push up and down between the two and count the chatters. (I only recorded on one, but that changed the chatter for both Chatots, so I'm not sure if both of them count to push the frame forward.)

I have literally thought of everything, but it doesn't even seem to be timer0 trolling because my timer0 for both machines is 123C and I've gotten that more than 10 times in a row with the same machine, so it's pretty stable in that regard.

Date and time are synced up to my computer's clock. since there's a small delay when you press "ok" to set the time, I account for that and normally get my clocks synced within a quarter second or less.

I actually only tried my girlfriend's 3DS because I thought it might be a problem with my New 3DS being a bit faster. But, I got a shiny legendary on the New 3DS. I seeded that and moved forward correctly twice with the New 3DS. But now, the game just seems to troll me. And... I've tried multiple seeds to get Terrakion to be shiny.

I honestly cannot figure out what's going wrong.

If anyone would like to help me, maybe talk over skype or something to help out, that would be nice. 




 Yeah, I knew *when* to press the calculate button, but *when* i was pressing it, I had no goddamn clue why.

So you're saying, if I get a seed with a target frame and it calculates a starting frame much higher than that, the seed simply won't work? Well, that's bull crap. 




 I've tried to get a seed to use to breed for a shiny. One thing I don't understand is what the hell all these guides mean by the pitch of the chatots' chatter. Another is when I press "calculate Initial PIDRNG Frame". What is this for, and why does it sometimes give me an initial frame much higher than the target frame? What does it even mean?

I really don't understand why I'm supposed to press that button. And I've actually not been successful in getting a hatched egg to match anything on the sheet.

I really need help in clarifying a lot of this.

In case it helps, here is some of my results from the parameter finder:  

    TID            163  
    SID            46347
    Actual Seconds 7, 7, 7, 8  
    VCount         8C  
    Timer0         123C  
    GxStat         6  
    VFrame         8
    Seeds          0B20A8E780F3313C
                   4910FA973BDFCB57
                   4EBBD421F656D009
                   D7D2BEEE423A5FFB

Every attempt was made at the top of each minute. For example, 2:20:00 or 4:53:00.

Note, I've gotten this to work now. It took a lot of trial and error. I had to learn to get around the qwirks of using a 3DS. Chatot pitch education really helped. I've left my info here for my own future reference.

 Thanks. 




 Thanks. 




 SID I'm assuming is secret ID. How am I supposed to provide my shiny value with just those? Unless SID is also my shiny value (which no guide ever said).

 If you're good, I'll be using your pack for sure. Please don't disappoint. 




 Sounds like "it's broken, so please don't buy it until we think it's fixed so you don't tell your friends not to get it."
