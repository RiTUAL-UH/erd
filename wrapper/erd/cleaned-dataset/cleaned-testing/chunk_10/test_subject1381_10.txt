 ANCHORAGE CITY POLICE DISPATCH

October 2nd, 2013

 nbsp;

Dear Will,

Sorry to be so formal about this. Unfortunately, Im at work and these official papers are all I have at the moment, but I thought Id write to you now, while Ive still got it in my head. My [memorys](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dnc2l/wellspring/) been kind of weird lately. Sometimes I have trouble recognizing my driveway. But Im not writing to bitch about my troubles. Not this time, anyway. I know you mentioned a piece of [evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dr8qk/languish/) to a weird case going missing. We found something similar on our end. I dont think its the exact same as yours, but it seems similar and sort of follows the same pattern. I thought Id send it to you, just in case. It looks like most of the pages have been ripped out.

Its almost exciting. Nothing happens here. Im sure youll get a call from me before you receive this, so we can talk about our normal man shit, haha. Did I used to wear blue a lot? Whens dinner? Do you think we all go somewhere after we die? I dont think so. I think we just sink into the dark, deep ground, and sink and sink and sink and sink

Shit, you caught me babbling and my boss just got here. Ill hurry up and send this before he jumps down my throat. Also, for whatever reason, the first page of the book has Wasps nest written on it, but in a different handwriting than the rest. Im sure youll get a kick out of that.

Sincerely, 

Adam

Im finally moved in! Addy seems to be a decent roommate so far. Shes pretty clean and gives me space when I need it. Cant say much more than that.

Its still taking a while to get used to. I miss the wide open fields. The smell of the desert on my hands. [Coyotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dwcp3/satiation/) in the night. Every star gleaming and glittering right in my backyard. The quiet, the peace, the solitude. Here, in this apartment, there is always noise. The washer and dryer might as well be stereos. Our neighbors run their own loud schedule, disregarding social etiquette. Sirens and horns and shouts are constant. It makes you appreciate those tiny moments - the white noise of the shower running, long car drives, cozy blankets. And I feel so silly for being bothered by living in the city because its still pretty far from what I imagine city life to be. For instance, I had to take a different route home because a cow got in the road and was blocking traffic.

Its still weird to call this place home. I think once I have my own space, itll feel more natural. Right now I share a bed with Addy because its better than the couch and she doesnt mind. Its the first time, outside of sleepovers, that Ive regularly shared a bed with someone. I dont necessarily mind it.

 nbsp;

*March 3rd, 2013*

My life is just about as busy as I expected it to be. But there are a lot of things I didnt expect.

Sometimes I wake in the middle of the night and see Addy sleeping so close to me, her face pressed up close, her breathing steady. Shes certainly the least cynical person I know, but she must carry a certain burden during her waking hours, because I have never seen her face so relaxed and sweet. 

Im learning to play the cello again. I feel like when I sit on my balcony, amidst all the noise, and begin to play, everything just sort of...turns off. I like that.

Weve been going hiking lately and always find cool little trinkets. I like to keep them on our windowsill.

 nbsp;

*April 15th, 2013*

I wonder if I can officially call Addy my girlfriend yet. I dont think you can until the other person agrees to. It makes me wonder quite a bit what she considers us. 

I would ask her, but the way Addy is, I feel like she would just tell me. I could feel us growing closer as the weeks passed, both physically and mentally. We started preferring each others company to our own friends. I was making good money but buying my own bed never crossed my mind. And one night, we just started kissing. We still do, occasionally.

I dont know why Im afraid to ask. I shouldnt be, right?

 nbsp;

*April 26th, 2013*

We found something in the woods somewhere

Never mind. I cant write it out. Im too scared. We cant bring it home.

 nbsp;

*May 23rd, 2013*

12:55 AM Saw it crawling from the shadow in the corner. Lots of teeth. Shaking. I think it said my name, but Ive never heard it spoken like that before. 

12:58 AM. I dont remember writing that. I dont remember that event. Heading back to the bathroom.

1:02 AM I dont know where I am, I can feel tile but everything looks like my old home, and I cant get up but I hear my mom and dad and I see it crawling, going towards them, and then it sees me and smiles

1:05 AM. Felt nauseous after that last one. Still dont know what I was talking about but I get a headache every time I try to remember.

1:07 AM its behind me, it breathes downs my neck and I want to turn around but I feel like if I keep writing, I might make it out alive, I just have to pretend

1:45 AM. Addy said I was passed out. She said I wouldnt respond but my eyes were wide open and I looked so afraid. After she held me for a while I fell asleep. I just woke up a few minutes ago. 

Its official, we cannot be alone for more than a few minutes. Well have to do a few more experiments to find the exact time. Addy wants me to stop, but I want to figure this out.

 nbsp;

*June 5th, 2013* 

We have to leave, I dont

 nbsp;

*July 3rd, 2013*

We are on the run. I dont want to say where because I feel like it can still connect to us [somewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3e0tmg/inveigle/). Were trying to find out how this is happening. We want to know if it can be fixed.

Ive never seen Addy so serious. I feel like shes been through this before, but as usual, Im too afraid to ask. 

 nbsp;

*August 7th, 2013*

DONT LOOK AT ME PLEASE PLEASE JUST DONT PLEASE

 nbsp;

*September 1st, 2013*

Im sorry, Addy. 

If you somehow find my next journal, youll know where to find this. I hope it didnt burn too badly. I took out the more embarrassing, horrible entries a long time ago, but I realized afterwards there wasnt much left. Maybe youll find those, too. I havent decided if Ill destroy them yet.

You were everything to me. And maybe I was to you, but I dont care about that. I just want to make sure youll be okay, with or without me.

I have a distinct feeling that we wont make it out of this alive or in one piece. I know youve been trying to convince me to go back to the forest with you, but Ive been procrastinating because I want to make sure things are set. 

Can you do something for me, please? Just for a moment? I want you to think of every good memory you have of me before you read on. I think itll be the last time you truly love me. Just trust me.

I wasnt totally honest with you when I said I wasnt a religious person. I think I always have been, until pretty recently. And I think that little thing that humans have, that thing youre always talking about that ties in with faith, is what got us here.

Theres more to that, and I might add more if I have time. I think youll wake from a nightmare any moment now. But know that when we leave, everything will have been set. Im going to try to make sure that one of us gets out of this alive, even if that isnt me. I made a pretty good bargain, and I think theyll be satisfied. 

I just dont know what theyll do to you, but at least youll be alive, and if I know you well, I think youll regain your own independence eventually. By then, youll probably have found this. Youre smart like that.

I dont know much about them, but I know theyre better than whatever watches us in the dark. I know youll find a way out.

Please remember me through your amber glasses. I think I liked myself best when you loved me.
