 Oh I have the annoying part down alright don't worry! I think I will grab an envelope and stamp tomorrow and do that, it sounds like a really nice idea, thank you so much! 




 Found some but most are around 40 an hour is there any better options you guys know? 




 Hi guys, so a couple months ago my girlfriend was diagnosed with depression and it's been really hard for her she moved away from her family to the uk to study and has not made any friends since september, she still does have alot of friends back home but she doesn't call them much.

Basically what i posted this for was how i can help her, i live about 3 hours away from her and i was staying with her since she was diagnosed but recently i've had to go back home for certain reasons and she's having a really tough time she's telling me she's so lonely, i call her but she's so quiet and won't talk, i miss her so much i feel terrible being away from her, i can't visit her due to money problems atm and i want to be able to support her and help her get through this while being away, i love her so much and i'm so lost i hate seeing her like this so what things can i do to help her through this tough time while i'm away i'll do anything to make her feel better. 




 So basically titan fall then? 




 This gives me hope for rangers pet AI in HoT 




 and Revenant. 




 Cripple isn't supposed to be fun! 




 Love the work but I don't really see any legs on this charr what happened there? 




 A lot of talk about sand has me thinking, they added silky sand to the PvP rewards, maybe we'll use silky sand to help rebuild lions arch??? Just an idea. 




 Ah thank you for the quick reply, so how much FPS should i expect to get myself 30ish? 




 I know exactly what the problem I have been the exact same way with my girlfriend and one point, the problem for me was just one day I started lasting less and less and it really damaged my confidence, I didn't really want to have sex as I know it would end in disappointment for her and I got no enjoyment out of cumming anymore as it just made me feel guilty, after that if my girlfriend started to tease me or try to kiss me with tongue I'd try to tone it down and make it less sexual as I was scared that it would lead to sex which would lead to disappointment again, I didn't want that feeling so I didn't want sex.

I don't have the answer to this problem but I don't think you should listen to the guys here saying "He's lost interest" that's exactly what my girlfriend thought about me, ASK HIM ABOUT IT! Only he can tell you for sure it helps to not make him feel pressured into having sex be patient and talk to him.

Feel free to send me a message if you wanna talk about anything. 




 I'm sure it's been talked about in the official forums and been commented on by one dev about making it aoe around the target, not sure tho i'll have a look for it! 




 What build are you using here i'd love to try it out in some pvp matches, flaming axe is the spice of life!

edit: nvm figured it out 6/2/0/2/4 




 Wyrms and Wyvern's are different kinds of dragons one's that the elder dragons are not styled upon, they are simply dragons, thus the "Dragonhunter" 




 Dragon Hunter probably. 




 I've played guardian since the start as my main and mostly PvP don't care about pve, and I for one am excited I don't understand your disappointment. 




 Personally I love the name but I don't think they will change the name because they may have already used the name in the dialog of the story if the braham picking up eir's longbow idea comes true, they would have to get the voice actors back in and change it and that cost money and time which I'm sure a net don't want to spare right now with working on the expansion. 




 I feel a good solution to this would to be to force New PvP players rank 1-3 perhaps to all play in the same games and not give them an option for hotjoin, unranked and ranked until reaching rank 3, maybe forcing them is a bit much and instead create a seperate queue for only ranks 1-3, this could give people some much needed practice against people who are also new to PvP and eliminates any higher ranked and skilled players from dominating and scaring away the new players. 




 Oh shit, here come the theorists, could be quite interesting  




 Make sure you load your emails from "All time" most of the time when i "lose" an old email it's because it's really old and my email is only set to sync emails from the past 3 months!
 




 Almost indistinguishable; you know apart from the fact they have letters telling you which is which. 




 If you guys haven't noticed anyone who participated in the beta few weeks ago gets a heroic chest! 




 So does this mean guardian will be the specialization getting all the shouts!?
