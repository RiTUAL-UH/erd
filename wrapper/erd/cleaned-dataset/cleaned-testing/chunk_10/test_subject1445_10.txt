 Yeah he moved across the country, essentially to be with me.  And when he did I was so sure without a doubt that we would be together for quite some time.  If I do end it, he probably has to move back home with his parents, and that would be it for us.  No chance ever again if I decided it was the wrong idea. 




 That is true, I never really thought about it being the pill?  Or the anti-depressant.  Being in this haze of depression really fucks up your thinking sometimes.  Maybe I should quit my birth control pill cold turkey, and talk to my doctor about the antidepressant.  

I feel exactly the same way about problems.  Like, right now, I just want to run away, be alone, on a beach or in a room, and not talk to or deal with anyone in person. That can't be healthy. 




 I agree about the relationships evolving part.  I've really thought about it.  I'm a pretty big "realist" when it comes to romance, marriage, etc, I've always known that love isn't like in the movies, or that sometimes, you love them, you just don't always like them, as the saying goes. But sometimes... I find it's not just rut, it's that I'm literally not attracted to being with him.  We haven't had sex in about 3 months (partly because of an illness on my part though) but I find myself not wanting to...with him.  

I think part of me wants to be independent too.  Whenever I used to think of milestones like graduating school, moving to X place, buying a house, whatever, he used to be there in my mind.  But now it's just me.  

It's like in How I Met Your Mother, where Lily leaves because she doesn't know who she is outside of their relationship.  I don't now who I am, how can I properly give someone else love? 




 Good point.  I just feel like I've screwed up so much.   




 Technically, not loving him. But I've been feeling ehhh for a while with my life anyways.  But I'm also scared to be alone :/
