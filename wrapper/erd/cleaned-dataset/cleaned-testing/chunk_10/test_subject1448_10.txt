   At first, I would like to say that this is a real story. I am now 17y old, and don't live in that house anymore.

  I was that ''disturbed'' kind of kid, you know? Had many fears, and always had that feeling that at any time, when I close my eyes at night, the monster in my closet would come to get me. Plus, I lived my entire childhood, and part of my adolescence in my parents' house, a pretty big house I would say, located in the countryside of my state. That house was quite... disturbing. Lots of unused rooms, a big courtyard, almost like a forest, and at night, that place would adopt a profound and eerie silence. That house, in my child's mind, haunted me. I suffered a lot from nightmares, the majority of them involved the house itself. Something very deep inside that big old house tortured me psychologically, especially at night. For all those reasons, as a child, I would only sleep if I was completely under the covers. Some events happened in that house by the time I was living there, and this is what I will relate to you.

  As a kid who loved to stay up late, skype with friends and this kind of shit, and then hear footsteps outside my door, and go and see what caused it, finding just an old quiet empty house, turned to be a customary event. The fist time something really eerie happened, I was having dinner with my family (dad, mom and older brother). 

  As usual, I was the first to finish the meal and did not hesitate to go to my room after it. On the way, when I was near a turn, that would lead me to my room, I felt an enormous fear possessing my body when I heard the unmistakable sound of footsteps coming from the room that I would end up entering. I turned pale as I ran out of action, there was no one in the house except my family who were still in the dining room behind me. I waited motionless, with a scream stuck in my throat, steps before the turn that would lead me to that room. I felt a breathe of cold air. The steps were getting closer to the turn. The light of this room I was about to enter was on and I could clearly see a shadow approaching, in short steps. Seeing that shadow, I could not take it anymore and ran to the kitchen, only to find my family with perplexed and confused looks. I sat in a chair, and could not speak; I remember my father asking me what had happened, but I was breathless. All I could say was that there is something in the house. My father and my brother rushed to see if they could find whatever that was, but they couldn't. ''You're imagining things.'' my father said to me, with a hard look. But I know what I saw; After that, I checked all the rooms in the house by myself, only to find nothing. This experience messed me up a bit, but what happened a few years later was what made me conclude that there is something in my parents house who do not want to be disturbed.
____________________________________________________________________________________________

  Fast-forward three years. I was living in an universitary town of my state and not longer with my parents, which I visited on a weekly-based. At this time I had a musical group in my hometown, and whenever we could, on weekends I was there, we gathered in to make some noise and have fun. I was therefore going back to my parents' house after one of those meetings that went late into the night. I was not drunk or in any other state that would delegitimize this story. When entering the house (I had the key), it was nearly 3AM. Everyone was sleeping, and I know that because I always check if I woke up anyone when I come home after those late meetings.
Tired, I put some pajamas and lay on the bed; But sleep would not come. Something was not right that particullarly quiet night. I browsed on reddit for at least 20 minutes, and when I was done doing that, I put off my cell phone and just tried to think about my life, patiently waiting for the sleep to come. 

  A brief explanation of how my parents' house is structured: there is a part of it where you can find the rooms for the children;  I sleep in one room, and my brother in another. Our rooms are very close, almost side by side. My parents have their own room, whis is quite far from ours, and the house continues with a lounge, and lots of other rooms, which I have already spoken that some are abandoned. The event that took place that morning haunts me to this day;

  Lying in bed, still awake, I heard the TANGIBLE sound of something  running very fast, like the sound of feet hitting the ground, at a great speed. It came from the back of the house, towards me. It passed in front of my door, still running, entered my brother's room and got on his bed (remembering that I have found my brother in a deep sleep when I came to check if I woke him). What you feel at this time is difficult to explain. You enter a mixed state of panic and alert; The silence that ensued after that was absolute. At this time, any noise I hear I would shit myself. My mind was divided into entering the my brother's room and face whatever it was entered there, or lie motionless on my bed, pretending to be asleep. The longest 30 seconds of my life just passed, as I am motionless in my bed, trying to reason what the fuck has just done that. In my room, there is a mosquito net on the door, which is used to prevent mosquitoes to enter the room. It was balancing. Proving so that something ran in front of it. Fear had fully possessed my body, then something happened that broke the silence. 

My brother started screaming. I'm not saying startled cries of surprise, but *panic screams*. Right now, confused in my thoughts, I jumped out of my bed and decided to enter his room and face whatever it is. The door was ajar. It was not that way. When I opened it, and take the first step inside his room, I felt something I can't explain. A very bad feeling, kind of a negative vibe was taken the room. It's hard to explain with words what I felt as I entered in there. My brother was lying all wrong in his bed, his legs crossed, head to the side. His two hands were near his mouth, fingers were moving up, flicking his lips in a continuous move. There was nothing else in the room. But that scene marked me forever. I was at least one minute standing there, trying to calm down of the situation that I had recently witnessed. Then, all of suddenly, my brother woke up. He looked at me with a puzzled look and asked what was going on. I said nothing, only that he should go back to sleep. And so he did. I was up til '6AM, so the sun would come and give me the least hope I was safe, and that it was over. I never told anyone about this.

 Today I live in the capital of this state, nearly 600 km from my small hometown. I visit my parents almost once in two months. My brother also do not live there anymore and we see each other very rarely. I have a few other weird stories about that house that I can share up here, but the post is getting too long; hope you'd like. Sorry for the bad english, not my natural language!

Cheers, LS.

 




 If that little dress is from a... idk, dead child, then it would explain why Molly had those ''childish actions'', like following the tractor and shit. Pretty creepy! 









 Just wanted to highlight the [shovel version] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oeb5LdAyLC8) 




 I noticed this when I saw that this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cucye/an_old_team_at_reddit/ was up to 20000 upvotes, and now it is with roughly 6000 thousand. Why this happen? 




 Doves! 




 That's right, the smaller one (: 




 Why the fuck my dad would stack these birds?! He found this scene in the wild, while he was photograhing other birds. The bigger one (male) is alive, and no one ever said this is an edited scene, it is natural. 




 They are the same species. The reason they look slightly different is that they are male and female. 









 Little background...  my dad is an ornithologist and photographer. Here's a sad picture he took of these two lovers. All credits to him.
