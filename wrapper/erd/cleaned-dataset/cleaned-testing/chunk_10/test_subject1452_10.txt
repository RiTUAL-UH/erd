 What does it feel like to be old? Which parts of the body ache, fail and change? How do you best take care of them to limit their deterioration? 




 Move to Australia. They come and eat bananas from our hands, lick cuddle and sleep. We throw them outside if they bark. 




 I gave up smell and fragrant foods like curries remained delicious. Wine tastes good but definitely lacks a component. 




 Marinate meat before you go. 
If hiking eat the perishables (steak and eggs) early and long term hikers sharing your campsite on will hate you.
