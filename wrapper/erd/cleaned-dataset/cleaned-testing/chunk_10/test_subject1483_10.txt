 Am I the only one getting 10? 




 I would just watch it free on BT Sports so I'm good. 




 #Repost. 




 You don't do that! 'The pass of Death' is frowned upon where I'm from. 




 Now if only the could actually get the App to work, that would be great!



I've been able to use the App for a couple weeks now, ended up deleting the sonofabitch. 



















 You should join a class or hobby you would enjoy, it's the best place to meet completely new people. Become a regular face then try to make some friends. 




 Dude, and I just started playing this game too! 




 *I'll Just Post This Code Onto Reddit*

*Aannddddd It's Gone* 




 ~~Nice~~ Neat Work FTFY 




 The superiority complex is strong in this one.   




 No no, Jenny only did besos. 




 TBH, Ive lived under noisy neighbours and it does get your blood boiling also add the fact that this family is grieving I can somehow understand where she is coming from. The racist remarks of course make her lose all validity in her argument however she is from a different time, it's hard to change. [I'm a young male snowflake btw] 




 For all you Arkham Knight fans, keep playing the game. My friend told me you will get a little surprise on your 3rd or 4th play through. 




 I was more interested in who did 911. Last I heard is was some band named Jet Fuel. 




 Fiestaaa!! 




 He's a shittier English version of Remi Gallard. 




 I did this once as well, got stuck in the save for most of the day. 




 What's worse is that the only reason this has come to light is because of the Andres Iniesta Instagram account thing that happened over the weekend. 




 Hodor?...**HODORR** 




 I'm currently on an early naughties binge. These feeds my nostalgia trip. Thanks OP! 




 Donde esta la biblioteca? 




 It's like a black hole just manifested off the view camera 









 I take a vacation day every year. It's a good excuse to have a day to do what you want to do that isn't confined to a weekend. 




 You  just have to hold you're breathe and wait for it to blow over. Oh and crap your board shorts of course. 




 Buying clothes with ease is pretty average. 




 The 80's. I mean they probably won't, but I wish they did. 




 Cuttlefish are badass!! Too bad they're really tasty as well. 




 Gibraltar back to back Word War Champs too!! It's funny trust me, look Gibraltar up. 




 ^^^^Hi ^^^^guys, ^^^^room ^^^^for ^^^^one ^^^^more? 




 I was just trying to confirm. *Casually* *strolls* *away..* 




 Why can women use sex toys with no stigma and men are confined to our hands? This is BS! Where are our equal rights!? 




 Illegal or legal, do you really care? Do you really think they police are going to bother with this bullshit?  




 That's cause im not in constant fear that ill go bankrupt if i fall ill. But hey what do I know right? Im just a stranger on the internet with a different with an outside perspective at the comedy show you call health care. 




 Anyone can go to a hospital in Cuba and get treated for free, by better i mean better in a real world sense, not on spreadsheets and charts.
 




 What the point if no one can afford it? The rest of the world really appreciates it though!  




 RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers WOHOOO!! 




 YOu guys really claim to have the best healthcare in the world? That's the most deluded statement I've heard in a while. Come to Europe and see how the real best healthcare in the world works. I never have to deal with the hospital in a financial sense. If I break, they fix me, job done. When do I pay? I've been paying my taxes since I turned 18, there's my contribution.  




 This shit really sounds crazy. How can a 1st world country have a health system that's so broken? Cuba has a better health system than America. 




 Guy Fawkes was killed. This is a new guy. 




 I'm not a woman either so I thought I'd share my FU in this thread. At a festival, girl starts rubbing her ass against my dick, I apologised and walked away.. 




 Soo many leaf bits. shit supplier. 




 I would love to make enough money to be able to give awesome gifts. It's an awesome feeling especially when you know they deserve it. I'm currently trying to save up to get my grandparents a car. It's fucking tough but it will be worth it seeing their faces in the end. 




 FINALLY!! Thought I'd never get my answer. 




 "Hey Moustache!" 




 Do they want Guy Fox?

Because this is how they get Guy Fox

 #WHAT'S IN THE ISLAND!? 




 Hijacking Top Comment because somehow no one has mentioned


#Wacky Racers 




 Awesome work OP!!, Just gotta do the same with your wallet now, buff that motherfucker up take it to a surgeon and get him to cut off the excess. Job done!! 




 Meh, worth it. 




 Dude, they better not be playing. You don't mess around with Bacon flavoured stuff. 




 Try it with bacon next, that's all I have to say. 




 Anybody have a transcript?? I'm at work :( 




 I have the ability to solve any problem or win any argument, about 3 days after they've happened. 




 I'm normally they guy demanding more zombie killing prowess from my friends. 


It could be on of them instead, but they don't take the time to actually learn what must be done to complete the game. It gets heated sometimes I must admit but it's an amazing time none the less and spent in good company.


Seriously can't wait! 




 Can't blame you, it's the obvious choice. I think UK when I see sterling too. Same with dollars everyone thinks US but you also have Australia and Canada etc .Although they're technically different currencies as they have different value. Then again however you have the Scottish pound which is less than and English pound. 



Money is weird concept. 









 I don't live in the UK I live in Gibraltar. Alcohol and Tobacco are really cheap here (surprisingly though there are very few alcoholics). On the other hand our food prices are pretty high when you compare our Morrisons to one in the UK. 




 Same here, the only thing I hate is that it's only every other COD game which has it. Some of the best coach co-op there is around today. 




 #RESTING INTENSIFIES 




 I don't how much that is but in comparison where I live I get a full litre bottle of Smirnoff vodka for 8. ~The world's a fickle bitch. 




 I was under the impression it was legal over there already. Guess my trip is waiting a couple of years! 




 I just like having a clean inbox. 




 It's Amy Schumer OP, good luck trying to get upvotes. Bleh. 




 I almost cried. I'm at the office, that would've been weird.  




 And I'm struggling to put money away to be able to afford a car, fuck this world. 




 Danger Dolan. 




 You're a moron. 




 Not only that. They were waiting for the cops to arrive to give the description of the bike that was stolen, he was probably confused as to why he was seeing the ends off two barrels. I know I would be, but then again I live in a place where cops don't carry guns and somehow still manage to do their job efficiently so what do I know. 




 Rubber bullets. They're obviously not mentally skilled enough to acknowledge a situation where lethal force is necessary so it should be removed all together.   




 Mucho thank you! 




 I had no idea things were this bad in America. wow. 




 I still can't say it. 




 I'm currently trying this, had a setback in a small festival this past weekend but not gonna let it deter me. There's another small outdoor festival this weekend so going to just forget this past weekend and hope for the best this coming one. It's tough but it's got to be done. 




 Where is season 2 being aired?? ITV aren't doing it anymore and it's driving me crazy trying to find it. 




 Maybe he was just trying to show how he can crash too? 




 In my country I pay around 20% Tax in my monthly income (single no kids). I can go to the hospital for anything with no problem and if they don't have the equipment required for a certain operation/test one of our neighbouring countries will put you in their hospital which the Government will pay for. It's a good life, can't complain. 




 Never thought of that. Will give that a go later. Thanks!

 This is why we can't have anything nice. 




 No no, didn't you know these are warehouse turtles? They look similar to forest turtles and are very identical in almost every way except that the warehouse turtle only live in Chinese Warehouses, silly western man. 




 TIL I have no original thoughts. 




 I'm white and don't even live in america yet this was childhood. 




 I don't mean make it only work via headset but when the headset is plugged in it could use the headset instead of it's internal mic to pick up voice commands. It would be a lot easier for the user to give the command and for the console to hear it. The camera in the kinect is still used of course to identify the person giving the commands.


It';s just a small thing that will make the experience a lot nicer. People wouldn't have to be shouting across their living room, instead they could speak into they're mic.  




 Edit: thanks for the downvotes guys. #progress.


So for people who use the Kinect, they know that when the TV is a bit too loud the Kinect cannot hear you, which is understandable.


My solution is simple and could be done with a software update. Allow Kinect to hear your commands via the headset.


I would make the Kinect user experience a lot more tolerable, as a lot of people enjoy blasting game volume to get immersed and not being able to use the Kinect properly when doing this can ruin a game if Kinect commands are allowed within the game.


It's a small thing I know but it's a small thing that will make the console feel a lot more responsive. 




 Uppity Bitch....I like. 




 Whoever topples it has to take care of it! 




 Sweeeet. 




 If you manage to take North and South America you're in the money. 10 troops per round and only 3 borders to defend. 




 Terrible signal up there. 














 Thanks for the informed reply! 


Hadn't really thought about the fact that it would have to be 3 separate 1080p displays, I was thinking more along the lines of one big image chopped up into 3 (I'm a moron). 


I see myself getting a PC quite soon tbh, see what all the hype is about! 




 For a long while now I've been wanting Xbox to make multi-screen a feature on it's console. [This latest image I've seen](https://i.imgur.com/HJ0QMju.jpg) makes me want it even more.

 nbsp;

Now I'm not sure about the capabilities of Windows 10 on Xbox One but is this something that could be done? Or is it more on the hardware side of things? Maybe an official Xbox multi-screen HDMI splitter?

 nbsp;

I'm just brainstorming ideas, but if anyone has any info on the matter it would be much appreciated.

 nbsp;

Edit: Damn. Thanks for the info guys! 




 The Captain heard the protest 



from this "pitiful pile of waste"


Line him up against that wall


And with his life, make haste.

^^^^Too ^^^Dark?
 




 Well that's just like your opinion I guess.


If his story is true (which tbh is believable compared to other stories on the internet) then he got screwed over by bad/ negligent customer service and Gamestop should correct that.


But then again, that's just like my opinion I guess.

 




 OP is just looking for his Xboxone. Let him be I say and good luck! 




 It's not more than a random gust of strong wind at the beach. If you someone managed to get stabbed I think it was Darwin's doing. 




 Searched competitive larping. So disappointed. 




 Can't adjust the lighting though. 




 Kick him in the head. 




 The fish at the beginning is not the same one that gets eaten. Seems like a different place ll together. 




 [Relevant near the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08c0BXTVpfs) 




 That's why we ended up doing 2 player on each TV. On four players it would crash and an error code would appear (don't remember the message it gave but it was pretty random)and that's not what you want happening when you're trying to do the story. 




 This is the only reason I will be getting it. Zombies is the most fun couch co-op you can have!!


I believe this one will only be 2 player split screen though. Thankfully that's how my friends and I play. LAN party woohoo!!! 




 I was actually planning on getting a mini fridge for my room but I don't want to go back on my never pre-order rule. Decisions! 




 I thought the same at the beginning but the game play demos have got me curios. I'll wait a couple of weeks after release to see reviews etc and make an informed decision. 




 That's an awesome pic. Wish I had some friends that were into this type of thing. Luck cunt! 




 Well it's got one thing right in that PC Gamers are mostly alone. **BRING ON THE DOWNVOTES** 




 I'm not religious but I like this man. Finally some one who actually seems to be in touch with the real world instead of the make believe one we have created for ourselves.


Edit: Any reason why I've been downvoted fro saying I like him other than you guys being assholes?. Didn't think so.
