 How much sex goes on?

How much underage sex goes on? 




 No. Eating more ice cream and want to punch everyone in the face. 




 Naw asked to fuck and he ignored me, even though he brought it up  




 I wanna say no. I think they get their beans from a tube so... 




 I'm veg and get bean tacos. You have to be a lax vegetation though, esp since they partner with kfc  




 21. I'm not sure, some HGTV thing but I'm more interested in my phone. Coffee with a bagel dipped in is good. I'm actually a breakfast cook. French toast is a goodie.
You can use bread with egg whites, cinnamon, vanilla, and splenda. Or potatoes and eggs with mayo. Or an egg white, spinach. Onion, pepper omelet! Healthy and low cal. Serve with plain Greek yogurt and splenda 




 Do you think being white would get you in a different position than you are now? I don't mean this as a joke, I'm curious of your view on race in this industry and your city. 




 Yes but already I can pretend they're all robots behind a computer.  




 A psychic told me i was in a covenant in a past life and hatred it.

I want mashed potatoes mixed with corn. Does taco bell have this? 




 What's your race? Do you have kids? What state are you in?

You should start being nice and apologetic and shit so if they do find this thread, you'll get some brownie points. 




 I wanna write you too! Never done that before. I'd imagine it'd give you a way to pass the time. Good luck dude. 




 Idk that's very hard. Today probably my sister because it's rare she lets me touch her let alone put my head on her shoulder. Rarities are beautiful. I love both. I hate male humans.  




 That's incredible. 2015 is on some hoodrat shit. I wish I could give you gold but for now I will give you a big hug and a thank you for being a great human. 




 I bet you don't ask anything. There's nothing worse than falling in love. I'll remain emotionally unavailable forever. 




 Droid maxxx. I love it! slightly cheaper than the iPhone and more storage. Great speakers. Swipe text. Highly recommend it! Iphones are overrated. 




 Yeah, that's where I've been looking and some are interesting but I can't convince myself to go to the free meetup. Idk. Great site idea though. 




 Tinder. So stupid and trashy. 




 Brooo.... 




 Thanks. There are some songs on there I never heard before. I should just listen to being as an ocean in repeat. That band hurts in the right way.

Thanks you, good luck to you 3 




 Yeah you're right, that album is something  




 Honestly one of the best things for me has been my 6am weekend shifts where I can drive with the windows down, alone on the roads, driving into the sunrise at 5:30. Nature has always been my savior, thanks for the reminder to see the little things. 




 
Thank you 




 Yeah I just feel bad about my weight and appearance. I hate being around people these days. I  hate when I stop going to the gym and thinking about my lack of perseverance. Gahhhh I need to suck it up and start something at home 




 I'd rather piss people off and hit a car on my street.

I get what you're saying and appreciate your input. I don't feel overly angry, just aggressive and dangerous. Sigh :( 




 I did for a second but I'm as our if shape as they come and feel to bad about myself to do anything about it. I'll look up since in my area anyway. Thanks 




 I'm feeling low as ever. No one should ever have to feel this way, not even my worst enemy. I'm looking for something, a song "deep" and impactful. I'm trying to remember my old 90s/00s emo bands but can't think of anything off the top of my head. I like indie rock and post pop punk and some post hardcore. Any songs relating to depression/suicide that preferably aren't mainly focused on a girl would help. Thank you. 




 I think it's more of wanting to impact people, fuck them up like I am. 




 Sorry I won't do as you say. There are different ways to deal with things. 




 No 




 No 




 Depression has taken over me for over a year and now its not just "blah", it is making me want to do bad, dangerous things. I want to bust a windshield, slash tires, not hurt people physically but cause a ruckus and destroy something. I am on buspar I think, may have something to do with it but " blah" sucked. What can I do to cure this urge and not do something stupid? Is this normal? 




 Just do it 




 Set up a nice room with dim light, candles, and some other lovey things, take a picture and saw you want to treat her right tonight. 




 Soap or candle making. Dart leagues 




 You must not be from America? 




 Barf! 




 Still deciding. Probably mushrooms. I hope we get it from the best pizza place EVER. I have wish you could try it. I'll update once it's ordered and in my mouth. Are you a male? 




 Still around? I'm waiting for pizza. What's your favorite topping? Where are you?!? And traveling to? 




 Brb I'm eating ice cream 




 Something to improve the world or industry, preferably one that doesn't target just a small audience. 




 Chipotle, salsatitas, moes. Plus you can two meals out of one plate. 




 Same boat! I'm just going to stick it out until February! I'm trying to do things on the side though, like working concessions at a concert or something, joining clubs in the area via meetup. Idk, its going okay... Or just quit now and start traveling! 




 Fuck yeah. Great story ending gracefully. 




 Lovely 




 I don't know anything about Nestle. What's wrong with it? What's with the water? 




 Did you get with the other girl? 




 Now I'm craving them. 




 Congrats 




 Too philosophical for me. 




 Seems like you need an adventure. This is the perfect time to travel or take an internship away from home. CC is going to cost a lot in Cali, but I'm not sure about other states on the west coast. Go on a road trip, volunteer, wwoof, workaway, do something. I'm moving coasts next year! 




 Yeah. One of my college professors asked us if we wanted a midterm. We said no. He said okay. At the end of the year he asked the same thing and we didn't have a final either. Or grade was based on journals we went over in class. 




 What the hell was going on in his head? I don't mean to be funny when I say this but maybe he liked you and was just immature about it. Or had a disorder because this is just strange. 




 And it's the opposite for me. Once I started working, I was like, do you really ride the bus? Why don't you have a car, you're already 18! Shane on me. I wish I used public transport or rude my bike everywhere.  




 You mean beautiful artwork. 




 This should be a new fad.  




 This was me. I excelled. I was thorough and quick and smart. Because I have always wanted to kick ass at everything, I have developed great multitasking skills and people are impressed with what I do and the time it takes me. This was great for the companies, but tough on me mentally.

Then I had a breakdown, my therapist brought up ocd in terms of perfectionism, I realized this, stopped giving too many fucks, and calmed myself down. I'm still thorough but not crazy. It's better this way but I'm no longer too dog at work.  




 I'd ask what he was thinking and how he felt. Then go from there. I can't really say I'd dump him straight away, because its based on his reasoning. Having said that, I hope this never happens. Or, maybe I do. I don't know, I'm a lost 21 year old. Love me. 




 Drinking your own blood. 




 Yes! My first thought when reading the title. Could have said Frank for the first season but she really hit the ball out of the park. Which I guess is good for her, if she had to be bad, she was very good at being bad. 




 Yes, and also repeated fitness jokes with memes, like "never skip leg day" or "do you even lift bro" or "gains for days." Once you saw 10 of them, you don't need more. 




 Will you be my boyfriend? Check yes or no. 




 Hot damn. Do you remember the titles? 




 Yeah, is there a correct answer? I never see balloons on the ground so I don't know. Big mystery, small brain. 




 When the whole universe was made. With whatever/whoever was making it. I need to know!!!! 




 Poetic truth. 




 False, you don't brush your teeth, shower, put on clothes or get out of bed. Sometimes you can't even reach for your phone because it just seems like so much work. You take sleeping pills all day because you literally cannot be awake or living that day. You don't know what to do, you shake and will cry for no reason, probably do something stupid or rude if you are awake, so you think its better to seclude yourself. Plus, you look like shit. It's time to be alone.

The next day you realize you slept through class yesterday and didn't turn in a paper. You start hating yourself, feeling guilty and thinking about how now youre not going to pass the class, then won't graduate, then won't get a good job, the live at home forever, have no love life, be a fat loser, die alone without friends. Your parents yell at you asking why you did that yesterday. All these thoughts together make you even more depressed, so you go to bed, or, you decide to drink the night away. Then, its midnight and you're crying and I texting your ex that doesn't love you, telling him all your problems and how youre a fuck up, how much you love him. Eventually you pass out, wake up, even mor depressed than yesterday (rock bottom keeps going lower and lower). You see the texts. Feel embarrassed. You're in disbelief that you spilled your guts, now he'll never want to be with me again, now that he knows I'm mentally ill. You decide you're going to cut everyone out of your life, the remaining acquaintances you do have.

This all fucks you up and you decide to call into work because you can't be near people today and can't bring yourself to clean yourself up. You feel bad you're letting your coworkers down and leaving them shorthanded. You feel guilty. The cycle repeats.

 Vitamins. Magnesium, vitamin d, b vitamins, and iron (often found in a multivitamin). Eating healthy. People don't realize how much this can affect you, but it does! Fresh food brightens myself overall.

Taking time to yourself to do something you enjoy, like reading or drawing or fingerprinting or walking through the park.

Lifting weights or anything that strains the body. To get yourself to go to sleep, you're supposed to tighten every part of your body, starting and your feet then moving up. But lifting things, this kind of does it for you and relaxes you. 




 Make a fist. See your knuckles. Start on the left big hump, that's january. It's big so it has 31 days. In between the knuckles is a valley, meaning the next month had less days, which is usually 30but we all know Feb had 28. Continue this mountain and valley thing. The last hump should be July, 31. Start again from the front, that is August, 31. Valley, September, 30. Etc 




 If your work has a restaurant, do not call the kitchen during their busy hours and ask a cook to stop the 86 things they are doing to come get your coffee and heat it up for you. 

Don't say "no, I'm not doing that" to something simple. I will make your job hell.
