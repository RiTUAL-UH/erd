 Reduced interest rates will be more likely.

 A lot of those costs are fictions from those who stand to benefit from them, the rest will be much more affordable soon. 




 Check the markets' response to Christine Lagarde's press conference tomorrow. 




 Affordability may look very different tomorrow morning, and the troika's conditions on Ireland will be the least of their worries. 




 Cheers for that, though it's a directive to improve:

conditional upon the ability of the member state to demonstrate that the non-charging for water services does not compromise the purposes and objectives of the Directive

Or to put it another way, we don't have to charge if we can fix it otherwise.

We're not **obliged** to impose charges, we're obliged to impose **changes**.

'Technically correct' it may be, but nevertheless we are still not obliged to charge for domestic water.

We are certainly not obliged to spend over ~1 billions in Euros putting in meters rather than repairs. 




 Yes we do, the exemption is straightforward.

You'll have my absolute sympathies for not trusting Irish Water when they, themselves, confirm this to be the case - but it's the case nonetheless. 




 Ah, the ISIF's contribution wouldn't count then? 




 Just before you do buy one:

 Your OS will load after this brief ad. 




 Oh man, that's it!

Can someone re-colour her top to Umbridge-pink? 




 "They've changed something["](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=z_KmNZNT5xw#t=15) 




 I reckon there's still a bit of nervousness about that.

There's a ruling due in [April](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/what-is-the-eu-test-on-irish-water-about-1.2010287) and if Irish Water doesn't pass it - then all Irish Water's spending goes back on the government balance sheet.

This injection of investment might have a role there. 




 And heels 




 Aye, it will be Dob-Uisce. 




 That was very refreshing. 




 "Life is full of suffering" she says with a smile and something like a giggle.

What is wrong with her? Does she know nobody who has been in that situation?

Then conflating the situation of an unviable foetus with that of an adult who has a terminal illness.

Is 'terminal category collapse' a known psychological malady?

I hope she suffers when there's nobody around to give her a Seanad seat.

Not that she'll suffer train fares or anything.  









 Cash only, and bring-your-own-gimp ;) 




 Would you like that? 




 I don't think a refusal to listen to Enda has to fall into either category, or the many variations in-between. 




 Probably the "if" part 




 So are all school students either knacker-drinkers or swotty-squares to you? 




 Though we have an exemption from charging for domestic water under that directive:

http://www.water.ie/help-centre/questions-and-answers/does-ireland-have-an-exem/  




 And here's Alan Kelly in direct contradiction of that:

["But constitutionally, I cant stand here and **vote** for something that I know to be unconstitutional. In fact, it would be against the constitution to do that.](http://www.broadsheet.ie/2015/02/11/gel-hath-no-fury/)

Looks like the crib sheets didn't go out in time. 




 This is bizarre, you've just made the same mistake again.

Can you provide me with your definition of 'political policing'?

So far you seem to think that it is impossible for a police force to be independent of politicians   their motives. 




 Great idea, and the drone could be controlled from the viewing platform at the top.

http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record county=ME regno=14401601

Then a quick spin over to the Round Tower in the town.

I wonder could the drone be piloted from the lower door of the Tower, then up inside and out at the top? 









 Your line of reasoning is based on a redefinition of what 'political policing' means.

Your redefinition isn't even close.

Our constitution separates the powers of politics and the powers of policing from each other.

http://www.supremecourt.ie/supremecourt/sclibrary3.nsf/pagecurrent/D5F78352A387D74480257315005A419E?opendocument l=en

Your attitude is much closer to 'Fuck Democracy' than the comment you're replying to. That comment is in actual support of Democracy.

Have you lost basic sense?

 Knew a girl from Yorkshire and she thought the exact opposite.

And then there was 'vase' 




 Sweet jebus, I need to go to the shops now. 




 So if I don't download eOS   I don't contribute to them, I am not a 'cheater' and I'll still have money to donate to the core projects   code that eOS itself relies on.

Therefore, I better donate to all the others because if they were to go belly-up eOS wouldn't have a project to work on at all.

Hmmm, this decision is getting easier.

 




 If only the violent thugs in my area got this treatment.

The only dawn raids the Garda do in my town is for breakfast rolls. 




 Between 2007 and 2013, 7 in every 10 specimens examined by the Bureau tested positive for drugs.

Does anyone know where I can get the data up to 2013?

I've found the data up to 2011: http://www.ucd.ie/t4cms/MBRS%20Roadside%20Drug%20Testing%20Report.pdf, but not further.

The detection rates of Cocaine coincides very well with the Celtic Tiger era and afterwards.

 




 This lad is a clown.

I will selectively target his on-record statements as a demonstration of his clownhood, though there are many more and selectivity isn't really necessary:

["People are very apprehensive after six years of hardship. They are tired of charges and **that mood is being exploited by the same people who gave you the anti-bin charges protests**, Rabbitte said. And **remember where the anti-bin charges protests led to   it led the privatisation of the bin services** and it led to people not being able to pay.](http://www.thejournal.ie/irish-water-pat-rabbitte-1754730-Oct2014/)

The privatisation of bin charges (this was in Dublin) were due to the use of a veto by the then chair of Dublin City Council.

That chair was held by [John Tierney](http://www.broadsheet.ie/2014/01/21/ever-bin-had/)

If the name rings a bell, it's because he is now of charge of Irish Water.

So according to Pat don't protest Irish Water because that might precipitate privatisation and the guy who did that to the bins is now in charge of Irish Water. Hardly the argument of someone who knows what he's talking about.

 




 I guess there was an effort at creating a distinction rather than a new meaning, but I don't think our Department is doing a good job lately of administering justice.   




 Ok, just to dispel some of the "that's bullshit" ideas - hypnotism does actually work.

It cannot make you do things very outside your moral range, e.g. murder, though it can make you do things that you'd consider doing if you were drunk for instance.

It induces a very relaxed state of mind, if you refuse a suggestion then that relaxed state is broken and you're back to normal. Hence, people often follow the suggestions to keep the relaxed state. That's the ELI5 of it.

As to, 'should I partake in stage hypnosis' - no you shouldn't.

It's often very embarrassing after the fact, can cause major sleep pattern disturbance and is best left to people who are qualified in it and have a medical professional reputation to lose if they screw up.

There are many anecdotal and some serious investigations into bad outcomes days afterwards in otherwise healthy people.

As a technical definition, falling asleep can be considered self-hypnosis.

Don't let someone (unqualified) mess around with something essential to your brain's healthy routines.


 




 It notes that Irelands reputation has been slipping with Transparency International **placing it at its lowest ever ranking** among the business community two years ago at 25th, behind Uruguay, Chile and the Bahamas.

If only this were surprising.

It makes 11 recommendations to the Government and has asked it to report in 18 months on the steps it has taken to implement the recommendations.

So a problem for the next government, and probably not a problem at all - as it won't be acted on.

 




 True, does flow better.

Though I think Department sounds more like our lot.

Ministry implies some sort of over-arching concern or ideal that I'm not sure our Department has.  




  Ministry of Justice

Didn't know we had a ministry for that. 




 Shatter said most of the public agree constitutional change is needed in this regard, adding that he hopes Fine Gael will include a commitment to holding a referendum on the issue in its General Election Manifesto.

This is not the shit-stirring I was looking for. 









 Which is great, I hope I get one in Ireland when that happens. 




 That's a pity. I probably sound like a stuck record on this board, but I'm with Digiweb and have next to no problems with them. They're honest when support questions are out of their range too.

Probably time for ComReg, a new Router and / or internet-shaming. 




 I really want to try one of these, but having an 'appointment' window to do so seems either bull-headed or even a little suspicious.

Are they nervous of selling all their stock too quickly, running up a production line only to be left with unsold stock, being exposed as a sub-par device, or do people have to be 'current' enough to know how to get them   thus create some kind of artificial 'cachet' for them?

I reckon the way to sell these needs to be a bit more like an R-Pi or Odroid.

Sure they're kind of niche for a while then let them grow via their communities.

Not gate the opportunity to simply try them. I really want a genuine Linux phone to succeed - just let me buy one when I've the cash. Don't tell me when to have the cash ready. 




 They'll have bored each other to death before they roll up their sleeves. 




 Definitely get a new router by pestering UPC (better option) or buying one yourself and getting UPC to walk you through the settings.

Rebooting routers can be a slow-failure or even a hack. Plus they're not so expensive that UPC won't capitulate if you say you'll leave. Also, twitter   boards.ie for internet shaming if the above doesn't work. 









 Dil ireann does more harm to Irish people than anything else does. 









 They will, but if the alternative is a repeat of the last 5 years - it mightn't look any worse. Who knows, a cheap Drachma would be a huge boost to tourism.

Plus they'll get to control their own currency which everyone else in the eurozone won't get - they'll get the fallout minus a say in currency. 




 I reckon they'll eventually be forced to accept a deal, otherwise Greece will say they have to leave the Euro due to German intransigence.

If that then becomes Spain, Portugal   Italy leaving the Euro, Germany will be accused of scoring a major own goal. Especially if it looks like they dragged their heels to appease political sentiment at home. 









 That's cool, I'm gonna wait till all the people with poor impulse control beta-test it first though.

 What the hell has Meath done wrong? 









 MotionPie, there is almost no other better choice:

 Yeah, QTEs are never going to be my definition of finesse. 




 What happened to the 2nd last encounter being the hardest, the last a little easier to let the player end with finesse? 




 Yeah. If he was proselytizing regularly I'd have no time for him or his music, but I'm not going to fault him for an aspect of parents' choices.

He did tell us that "the information is ravenous. The ticker tape feeds the mind".

I can't help feeling that he knew more about living under a surveillance microscope than we did when that album was released, and he'd given us plenty of warning. Not that we really listened. 




 "I'd like two half-price Garda, and one Marijuana please" 




 In fairness to Beck, he was born into it.

Tom Cruise, well, he has no excuse. 




 I reckon saving citizens from unnecessary anguish and pain doesn't need a mandate. I hope so anyway.

 I think it's 12. 




 They're great.

They have me glued to the screen. 




 I'll look only at candidates that are not FF, FG   L.

I'll see what they're like closer to the time, as well as keep an eye out for the chancers running as 'Independent FF, FG or L' - that one really winds me up.

Which reminds me, I'm going to see if I can get people interested in banning those stupid posters from the town at the weekend. I think it should be one board in the town and one poster per candidate on that. It's 2015, they can use the web and / or canvassing.

 




 Good for them.

I don't think that was the case during this debate though:

["The report stage began at 11.50am on 10 July, and was adjourned at 5am the following morning. At about 2.40am, as deputies were awaiting a division, Tom Barry pulled ine Collins, a fellow Fine Gael TD for Cork East, onto his lap."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_of_Life_During_Pregnancy_Act_2013#D.C3.A1il_stages).

So either the vast majority of the drinks that night were ordered between 5am   5.30am, or those 331 drinks were spread through the Dil's working hours.

I've little to no time for people who drink on the job. 




 You don't think they waited till the debate was over before they started drinking do you? 














 Great idea!

The 'Lapgate' [tally](http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/lapgate-fails-to-call-time-on-dail-bar-drinks-254568.html):

The Members Bar can stay open for up to an hour after the Dil has finished its proceedings, and on the night of Lapgate **served until 5.30am** as the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill was discussed and voted upon by TDs.

Takings in the Members Bar  exclusively reserved for TDs and senators  for that all night session amounted to 1,440.80.

Till receipts showed that 331 alcoholic drinks were downed by Oireachtas members during the session.

These included 105 pints of lager at a cost of 493.50, 74 pints of Guinness, totalling 318.20, 22 pints of Smithwicks costing 94.60, and 31 quarter bottles of wine amounting to 170.50.

Thirsty TDs and senators also knocked-back 31 bottles of beer at a cost of 145.70, and forked out 118.90 for 29 glasses of gin and vodka, and 85 for 17 brandies.

The adjacent Visitors Bar, where TDs and senators often entertain guests, and other Oireachtas staff and accredited media drink, also had a roaring trade that night, taking in 3,572. 
 




 The Catholic Church has plenty of money. If they didn't you'd think that over the last 13 years they would have asked the Vatican for a loan. It's not remotely broke. The Vatican Bank had ["a net profit of 87 million in 2012"](http://www.theexpgroup.com/blog/success-blog/vatican-bank-publishes-first-set-accounts/) on assets of 5 billions.

I think they're just running out of road, the part-true / part stalling-tactic of claiming complicated ownership structures has bit them on the ass. Now they'll have to sell more of what they can sell and they'll still be short.

Anyway, the church is extremely fortunate to have been giving such an easy time of it. It's not like they deserve it. 









 Yeap, and LG Smart TVs have already been caught doing it:

http://bgr.com/2013/11/20/lg-smart-tv-spying/  









 Sometimes I wish the parliamentary whip was an actual whip. 




 And before this they blamed 'complicated legal ownership structures', it's been 13 years since they were told they had to contribute.

They should have started selling back in 2002 when they were told to and then they wouldn't have this problem. They even got a deal reducing the amount the total amount they had to pay.

It's time to put a definitive deadline on repayment. 




 "I would wish the pharmaceutical company would be more reasonable dealing with such a small group of people"

He talks like he's in some Jeeves   Wooster show and I imagine he thinks that will impress people. He just sounds aloof and clueless.

As for the 'if MM gives me the number' - is that petty Dil point scoring over very real life-threatening diseases?

Imagine what the people with this illness must think hearing his tortured excuses. Amazing the amount of things this government has the money for with rushed or no debate, but saving Irish citizens' lives gets this heartless, drawn-out waffle.

It's time Marie-Antoinette of Mayo called a general election.



 




 Imagine if he wins!? Would it then be ok for Government Ministers to talk about people's private lives or Garda interactions on TV any time they want?

I can't believe he's dragging this out. He must feel the risk to his reputation is worth the chance of the appeal failing.

Then there's the commission of inquiry ... 




  Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights 

states:

Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right.

That is not an attempt to define Marriage. It is stating the right of Men   Women to marry.

Nowhere does it state a limitation on what gay marriage can be, should be or is.

All you've done here is state that the ECHR has nothing to say about gay marriage.

Please remember nuance while you are advocating a two-tier citizenship for Irish citizens in Ireland based on sexuality.
 




 The Wolfson DAC clicks onto the Pi, no soldering required, then I put [Rune Audio](http://www.runeaudio.com/) on it.

From there it can be controlled via any browser, or ssh in.

I've put it in an old stereo cabinet so it's all hidden away, and the sound is beautiful. 




 The irony of Ghostery finding **20 trackers** on that article ... 




 They are fantastic though.

I've the Wolfson DAC and the improvement in sound is astonishing.

Crystal clear sound for ~80 isn't bad. I wouldn't be without it now.  




 So what are you proposing? 




 Well, we don't have to wonder. We can just look at the UK which has a few decades of privatisation, and let that guide us:

["The universal experience of water privatisation in the UK was a sharp increase in the cost of water. On average, prices rose by over 50% in the first 4 years. The first 9 years produced an increase of 46% in real terms, adjusted for inflation. The details are shown in the table below."](http://www.psiru.org/reports/uk-water-privatisation-%E2%80%93-briefing)

Plenty of data   review on that site, worth a look.

The TL;DR is that privatisation has not improved efficiency, has not brought prices down (the reverse happened) and that infrastructure improvements never materialised or were quite delayed and of poor quality. 




 Nah, but I'm guessing if there's anything that will prompt one - it will be about this stuff: Callinan's resignation, Garda et al.

Though IW will certainly be in the running. 




 I use an Odroid U3 as a desktop and it's great! Works for days   days, isn't crazy slow or super fast. More than capable as a desktop replacement. I've been using one for ~6 months. I use another as XBMC + TV Computer.

The C1, on the other hand, I can't imagine is quite the same. It's considered ~30% less powerful. I haven't got one yet though, so I can't tell you for sure.

Though for casual surfing (no flash video) and simple office tasks I'd say it would be very good value, just not super fast. 

Using an eMMC rather than an SD card is essential for good speeds on either.

This would bump the price up a bit, ~30 for an 8gb eMMC.

I'd place the C1 as a good way to turn a 'dumb' TV into a Smart TV, but not for everyday office use. The U3 is fantastic as both, I can tell you that from experience. 




 Edit: Oh well, you can scrap the below. The video eventually started stuttering and was agony after I skipped forward 30 seconds.

~~Oddly enough, I tried this about 20 minutes ago.

A 10-bit video on a regular Pi B with this OpenElec build and it played!

There were block artifacts at the beginning but after about 5 seconds they stabilised.

I'm still surprised, and I'll probably watch the whole thing tonight, saves me a commandline snafu with ffmpeg.~~ 









 They have to read something while they're sitting in the station ;) 




 Enda Kenny has denied that his Fine Gael colleague had any role in shutting down a Dil debate on alleged Garda malpractice last week

This reminds me of the McNulty appointment fiasco, where 'nothing untoward' happened - only to be followed a week or so later with 'the appointment fell below our usual standards' and 'unnamed FG officials' causing the problems.

Whatever about Shatter's involvement, I wonder if Enda is on record denying that **he** had any role in shutting down the debate?

edit:

The letters are [here (pdf)](http://www.merrionstreet.ie/en/ImageLibrary/20150103OHigginsInquiryDocuments.pdf), and the journal has a summary [here](http://www.thejournal.ie/enda-kenny-alan-shatter-letters-1918378-Feb2015/)

There's plenty to read, though during a quick look I saw this from an Alan Shatter letter pg 25 of 33 - "it is my view that the rule of law and the constitutional principle of the separation of powers should be upheld and respected".

I still think that via Brian Purcell either Alan Shatter or Enda (perhaps both) got Callinan to resign. We should ask all involved. 














 I find the tone of some [Garda Review Magazine Covers](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BjsnlCsIQAEUyz9.jpg) unacceptable. 




 I feel both can happen at the same time.

/onelittlefavouruniverse 




 In fairness to my pal, she was correct.

The exchange is one of the earliest ones enabled, the lines clearly running across the road to the exchange and were dug up enough times too. It's Eircom's responsibility to ensure the d2ds know the locale.

On a personal level, I'm with Digiweb and my neighbour's with Eircom. The only difference in our lines is where they split at the two houses. I get my fibre upgrade in 6 days all done, and no drops. My neighbour waits 6 weeks, and it takes 3 months to get a stable connection.

I reckon Eircom's problems are fairly ingrained at this stage. Though in fairness, I think they're also in a bad position - responsible for almost the entire infrastructure and trying to be a regular telecom company at the same time, with plenty of ethos / staff left over from its public utility days. 




 Cheers for that, I was guessing Dil privilege was one thing the government did not want to see used during the debates.

So I can see the CC's point with privilege, though I would have loved to see such a debate, and what the opposition came out with. 




 Might have been staggered crops. 




 I think it's a fair point from Padraig that 'sub judice' is typically for juries and high court judges are expected to know how to avoid such a bias. 




 I don't have one, so I wouldn't have a clue sorry. 




 It is shocking really, for such an agriculturally accomplished nation, we should be ashamed at the quality sometimes. 









 A friend of mine was told, by a door-to-door Eircom fella, they couldn't get reliable Broadband as the exchange was too far away.

The exchange is the big building right across the road (~20m at most).

He was given an earful for that mistake. 




 didnt handle it well

:);):) 




 Maybe it's because I'm not signed-in, when I click events it's all the previous ones.

Anyway, I know when   where for tomorrow! 




 Unbankable 5 




 The facebook page is fairly out of date 









 There's a big thread about game emulation with the Odroid [here](http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=11 t=2684 sid=8d49f9d35f95aa682984545afea372fe start=450). I love my odroids, I've only played a few emulated games - I'd no problems though. They're quite fast compared to the Pi. 




 'The lady protests too much' 




 Yeah. I think it's a de-privacy plague.

I've had no luck convincing people to use one browser for Facebook only, and another for everything else. 




 Aye, I'm more worried about the digital bread-crumbs people are unknowingly leaving around from even a 5 minute surf on the web. If I can get my f   f doing something about that, then I'll move them onto more robust protections for their devices overall.

Though I'll end up automating most of that, if previous experience is anything to go by. Not that I blame people, if a car mechanic starts explaining the intricacies of engine repair my eyes start to glaze over after a few minutes. So I reckon most people feel that way about computer security   privacy.
