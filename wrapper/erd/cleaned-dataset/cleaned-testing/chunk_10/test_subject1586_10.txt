 This is exactly it. Thank you, from every creepy part of my being.  




 This came out BEFORE Warehouse 13. It was a website that people could submit content to. The format was that you were reading files on a secret asylum for dangerous supernatural objects and/or creatures. Each story was given a case number and some of them were terrifying. I seem to remember one of them was about a man sized doll like thing that always stood in the corner, but if the lights went off, or someone stopped watching the camera feed, it would move to a new location. (Pretty sure this is Pre-Weeping Angels) Any ideas? I've looked and looked and haven't come back across it. Thanks in advance for any help. 




 As much as I want to agree, we fired him and Cincinnati gave him a place to land. Instead, we should be proud that the Ohio NFL is completely in honor of Paul Brown. Cincinnati is the only team in the AFCN that I have respect for, and the way they treated Paul Brown is the main reason. 




 Yup 









 Never had an issue with a 20 dollar knock off from AliExpress. Never bought a piece of official NFL gear that wasn't junk. 




 Brandon Weedon.  




 Good looking out! Thanks 




 I don't think I'm going to be able to make it. I live in Index, WA. It will be years before this happens again, and it rose out of my price range between last time I looked and now. Thanks anyway, y'all.  




 Thank you very much, sir. 




 Hey, folks! Curious as to what sections a Browns fan would be looking to buy his tickets in? Which sections line the visiting side of the field? Thanks in advance! 




 Everything I hear is that they hate us, and when they meet us they take the time to ask us why America is so fucked up. But many people online that I have met from overseas have been very nice.  




 Seems legit! 




 What do you think the payoff will be like when we actually do win a ring?  




 "As if we need any more reasons for the [REAL God](http://orig00.deviantart.net/9bdf/f/2007/284/6/6/quetzalcoatl_by_genzoman.jpg) to hate this team" 




 It's like cutting down the Nazi forest. It stands as a reminder on how NOT to act. They are dooming us to repeat or mistakes 




 Go Flashes. Except James Harrison.  




 Probably as proud a moment for Haden as being drafted. He is a shoe whore of the highest caliber. Congrats, Joe! 




 If there is one thing a Browns fan is going to win at, it's corn hole 




 If they were ugly, Haden wouldn't have the #1 jersey. It'd be all: "I love Haden, but I wouldn't wear that jersey"

 Yeah. These have no red on the throat, or green anywhere though. Orange head, white neck band, orange body, white tail band.

 So, there Is usually more to a situation than what is written.  If you don't mind me asking: What happened with the missing equipment? Also, thanks for letting us know you went on this trip!  




 Yeah.  




 Wait until the membership drive.  









 I had a friend who was signing some paperwork with a lawyer. The lawyer was dressed casual and felt the need to explain:

**Lawyer: I'm sorry about the jeans and tshirt. I'm on my way to a U2 concert as soon as we are done.**

Without missing a beat my friend responded:

**My Friend: Does that mean you are 'Pro Bono?'**

*Mic Drop* 




 That's oddly accurate. Good call. 




 Totally a gift from the grandparents in Kent. Has been in their closet for 20 years, I would imagine. You should scoop that other jacket, though! 




 It started originally in fiction as the symbol that the High Priestesses led by Vivian, The Lady of the Lake, wore in The Mists of Avalon. It has become, through pop culture, a symbol of women who are leaders within Wicca. It shows a person who is empowered. Not everyone uses it, but it was a powerful day when the women in our group decided to get their tattoos. Since getting hers, my woman is now the leader of the largest Wiccan church in the world: The Aquarian Tabernacle Church. 




 It is. It's religious.  




 Dear you, yes she does.  









 We call that "Nope". Don't smoke the Nope. You have vaped all the good you're going to get. It's a trick. Like chewing devils grass on the hard pan  I say thankee-sai.  




 I am mother fucking Steven Universe. I am doing great. All I wanna be, is a guy who gets to see a giant woman. 




 Now, /u/timteblows316, try to remain calm. 




 Lol! 




 godamnit..... 




 Still friends 18 years later. Shit...18 years is a long as time. 




 Holy water chugging contest. 




 What version of the devil? Are we talking handsome fallen angel, or cloven hoofed and horned demon? 




 I was 14. My date and I were lying on the bed, feet to head, and talking. My back was to her and she was facing my backside. My butt was directly in line with her face, and I farted. I farted loud and long. I then buried my head into my pillow and offered to take her home. She laughed and I knew then that she was one of the coolest people I knew. Still can't believe I did it. 
  




 It's true. My church runs an international online ministry and school. But if you are looking to elevate to High Priest/ess, you have to find a teacher willing to train you, and you have to get your elevations in person. Thank you /u/wolfnotaku, for the connection! 




 Well, I was just told people seem to really like slowpoke tail . lol

 In our house Jesus Christ turned to Jeebus Chrysler  turned to Cheesy Linguini turned into Jesus Luigi. So, we say "Jesus Luigi" 




 I won't be spelling this correctly,  because it's Gealic, but "Nukleivae" (nuckle-lee-vay). Supposedly a large, white, blob of flesh(?) that is fast,  and eats people. Learned this from an Irish friend. I have had it semi confirmed by another friend who is English but has lived in Ireland for twenty years,  that it is a real Irish cryptid. I can't find any info on it online or in books,  though. 




 Damn...I thought y'all were gonna to, in addition to complaining, take some action to make things better.  Just grabbing the low hanging fruit without attempting to make a difference?  Well that's at least comfortably normal. At least #WeBarkTogether  




 *There will only be 19 people who will even get this, but the Tower compels me.*

"But time was funny now, and the Cleveland Browns new coach was as trig as someone dancing the commala at charyou. But where the followers of the Man-Zells time may have been, knew there would be water if God willed it, or so the old stories said. But you could never be sure this close to the Tower. The world had moved on." 




 Does Giant Eagle carry stuff? Also, I am traveling back to Portage County in 2 weeks. Anyone in thread know a good place for gear, there? 




 I'm so happy one of you fellas, or ladies, is going to make us a new sports app! Bleacher Report has its problems, and I'm excited that one of y'all is going to make something better! 




 Skeptics may disagree, but 4 out of 5 dentists know the truth. 




 Cactaur a hater 




 I follow all the current roster that has social media, that I can. Shiz is usually dope, yo. #SpencerFuckingLanning 




 I just want the people on my team to have some social media sense. They need it to be a good example for the man literally rehabilitating off of social media. I'm not all in on Johnny, my history will show me as a Hoyer fan, but I understand addiction, and social media is part of his addiction. I DO want him to succeed. This kind of stuff hinders that, imo. 

Additionally, I would be willing to bet that if West, Crow, and Duke are in a three way tie, it will come down to personal conduct, and this kind of stuff shows a person as not being mature. Will that impact the front offices opinion on him? *Shrug* I just hope for a good, powerful, responsible, team. **We Bark Together**

 You're welcome, and thank you for your insight!  




 No hunters here.  




 Shannahan doesn't love you. You are a stepping stone to him. The next step in  the fulfillment of his own designs. As soon as he sees a higher step, he'll take it and f @$ you over for being in the vacinity when he does. Because he'll throw your whole organization under the bus to make himself not look bad, and justified for not having the honor to stand by his contract. Though you'll most likely decide he was better off the team than on. Just the same as every other team he has been on. 




 Yes. It is a green, plastic, mailbox from a demolished house that was salvaged to replace our aging, wooden, one. And that is also a convex mirror worn we ooden rsys that come off of it. Like a 70's deal. 









 That is a good question! Orange is the color of the sacral chakra, and that is the chakra that rules your passions, and chakra ARE Indian, so I'm going to grade that a big "Most Likely".

 There is no water to be reflecting.  




 Thank you, Professor. 




 Quetzalcoatl? I think he is more into soccer. 




 Sorry to be kinda agro in my other post. I'm not trying to be like that. We had no one else here. No kids, everyone would be at least 5'7". 




 The top part of each arm has tattoos, yes. 




 [Here is a picture from the 2 evenings after the initial photo when I was trying for a comparison](http://imgur.com/e1qyUHf) Also, the last part of your post rationalizing away everything with possible scenarios is...I don't even know what... The most made up part of this whole account is the stuff you threw in there. I told you no one was home except for me, my wife with long red hair, a tattooed man and his long haired, heavy set wife. We live in the middle of the country. We don't even have sidewalks. No kids were home. Also, the dog rolling in the yard wouldn't allow anyone to just randomly be there. 




 The only women who were here have long red and brown hair. Though none of them were on the porch. Everyone but me and the dog were on the other side of the house. 




 Opinion noted. Thank you. 




 Yes. 




 [How is this?](http://imgur.com/Fd5e1EE) 




 I didn't post it to explain it. I posted it to share. I also am not the belief police. I don't mind if you don't believe in ghosts. I'm sharing to add content to the community. He has no back, no lower body, and the way his arm would be up by his ear is unnatural. I thought it could stand the community going over it, not me trying to explain it's validity. I only know what I know.  




 A little background. We just returned home to our house in GA. It is also a small local church with a small congregation that has been meeting there while we have been gone. It has always been haunted. You can just feel it, hear it, doors won't open, lights will go funny, etc. We have been gone, and the people watching it had vacated and it was in a level of disrepair that had me really unhappy. Two people from the folks from the church were there. A tall skinny man and his wife, who is very heavy set with long hair.  I took this establishing shot because my wife and I were considering selling it. I then thought I had caught a weird energy ribbon  on the porch. I freaked out because I thought it was an apparition. Then I realized it looked just like the man who was over, and I decided to prank  my wife and show her the "ghost" I found in this picture. She freaked out just like I did. I then told her it was just our friend and she laughed and commented that it looked so creepy we should a how it to the guy himself and tell him it was a ghost, only to reveal it is actually himself. It would be hilarious! So we did it. Only he sobered us up in return. This was actually looking in the same 2 hours, mind you. He said: "My hat's red, man. And that arm of mine is covered in tattoos" He pointed to his Nascar hat (the hat in the picture looks brown), and pulled his sleeve up to reveal a wizard tattoo. Then my wife notices the second figure crouched down in front of the lowest red circle on the wall, seeming to be sitting. But there is nothing but a shelf there, and then we noticed where the man pointing toward the door is standing was nothing but building supplies and junk. 

So, there it is. I don't know, but I know those weren't people that were here. My wife says that they look like Kenny Paradise (the tall skinny guy) and Doc Thompson (the sitting guy that looks like he is wearing glasses and blue scrubs) they both used to live here, and she says she has met them both before they died. 




 [Here we go. This album shows a series of closeups](http://imgur.com/a/OQbYk) 









 I bought this off a Jain (follower of Jainism) who explained to me that the color comes from the idols in India where they smear a paste of tumeric and the red color that they use to make the dot on their third eye, which makes this color. Awesome picture, btw! 




 And as Ganesh is the Remover of Obstacles, our run game is about to be off the chain. (Dawg Pun) 









 Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah. 
I would be the host of, everyday Christmas
Give Dusty a wish list. 
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt. 
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit. 

Give away a few Mercedes like, "Here, lady, have this". 
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish. 
It's been a couple months since I've single so. 
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the "Ho Ho". 

Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit. 
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did. 
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid. 
Everywhere I go I'mma have my own theme music. 

I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunking on his delegates. 
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette. 
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it. 
But keep the fives, twenties, tens and bens completely separate. 
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it. 
I'll probably take whatever is left and just split it up. 
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks. 
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was. 
Eating good, sleeping soundly. 
I know we all have a similar dream. 
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet and put it in the air and sing. 

 




 "The only coach in the NFL not connected to Paul Brown is Chip Kelly"

The funny thing about that in my opinion, is no coach reminds me of Paul Brown, with his ability to create new ways to play the game while skirting the rules, like Chip Kelly did with the remote controlled car during mini camp. Brown would have pulled that same card if they had portable video and remote controlled cars in 1950. 




 When anyone says "that is something I do do" I always say "You said 'do do'." I also giggle when someone says "duty."  I am 32. 




 I really like this subreddit. 




 It's close,  but the one I saw was so very red. Not spotted at all, and the yellow was not dirty or muted. It Was VIBRANT. I can only defer to the people I asked, and if you think it's a Summer Tanager, and they DO look very similar, I am going to assume I just saw the most vibrant avatar of the Summer Tanager in existence and be proud! Thanks, all! 




 It was about the size of a cardinal, but it had no crest. The pictures that have been suggested are not what I saw, but thank you for the interest. I have been busy and am just getting back. The top half of it was cardinal red. Like it was the neck of a [Makers Mark]( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111216193258/whiskey/images/a/a1/Makersmark.jpg) whiskey bottle. Then the lower half of it was yellow to orange, or orange to yello, but the difference between the red and the rest of the body was dramatic. 




 I was driving down to the boat launch, and near the bend in the road, this bird was standing in middle of the street. It had no black on its body. If a Phoenix was actually a canary, then this little candle flame of a bird was a Phoenix. It was so neat and as an avid bird watcher, I screamed when I saw it, because I had never seen anything like it. I couldn't get my phone out before it flew away. I have been on WhatABird and all over Google and I can't find it. Any ideas?

 









 The Usual Suspects 




 Every day it's the same thing: Lotioning and Oiling and Oiling and Lotioning. I CAN'T TAKE IT ANY MORE!

 Sounds Dawson-esque in his ability. Lock him up. 




 Yes. No. 




 Son I couldn't agree with you more. My grandparents are friends with the former equipment manager of the Browns when I was a baby. He moved when the team moved, and I think he is still with the Stealers. (I wrote that correctly) But I was decked out in merchandise from the employees catalog as a baby. I was an Orioles fan as a child because I was so used to the color orange (Ripkin helped)   




 That's a powerful story. Thank you. 




 Was there ever a time that you thought you could leave the Browns behind, and follow a new team? Was there ever an "Historic low point" that you went through as a Browns Fan? 




 Well, little person, we didn't just print money. The government taxed the American People for that money.  




 I m holding out for a #5 jersey 




 Is that shit legal?! 




 It's a QB situation.  He wont start getting quality receivers until he has a quality QB. You don't trick out a Chevette with pipes and rims. Wait until we have a Bently, or at least a Pontiac, before we start trickin' it out. 




 Browns nailed it. 




 Ray Farmer is my fucking hero. 




 Proof of the Curse Reverse. Steelers pick @ 22. 




 D'awwwwwwww! 




 Parker and Shelton. Just there to choose from..... 




 /u/professor_tappensac gave me [this #16 helmet]( http://imgur.com/Np41W5Q)  , knitted by his lovely wife. I wore it to my first game, Browns v Panthers in 2010. We won. I wear it today. 




 Glad you like it! I can't blame your brother for drinking that Ninkasi. Those are good. We bark together, my friend!  




 My D4D package is at home in WA waiting for my return in July. Tonight I will be dinning on Hop Hash IPS from Sweet Water Brewery, Dragons Milk, and Golden Monkey. 




 Unwinnable fight. It's a members drive event only, but it's a WONDERFUL members drive event. 




 The rest of the world only uses the word "great" sarcastically, or to denote something so big it defies logic.
