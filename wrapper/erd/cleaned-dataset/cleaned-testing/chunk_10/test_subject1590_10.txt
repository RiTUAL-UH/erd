 you can comment/vote on pictures, that's all. 




 haha 









 Byblos is not bad. 




 it's not worth your time. 












































 I wouldn't. As you settle more cities, the cost of techs go up, so I'd rather attack Iroquois and take their cities. 














 United 




 Here is something you can entertain yourself with.

 Not sure why teams are getting new logos and the new ones look worse than the old ones. 









 definitely looks like a watermelon to me 




 Never seen my club live.

I must not be the only one. 




 Yeah, it looks stacked, but you know, we play a lot of games during the year, and I'd say you want at least 8 midfielders (2 people per position) for subs   injuries, so it's not that many. 




 Some trophies are worth more than others, and League Cup, that's really half of a trophy imo (league champion = 1 trophy, continental = 2 trophies). 




 Vidal is leaving to Bayern right (or at least that what others have been saying), so really there aren't that many midfielder on the team. 




 I think this is a really good offer, tbh. Their valuation is at 4MM, which means they've probably raised a seed round of ~1MM (my guess), and they are willing to offer 100k + bonus. This is a really good sign.

Equity wise, I think 1.7% for the 10th hire is also very very decent. 




 Vidal didn't play his best season, IMO, and I wonder if this is because of some personal reasons or he is starting to decline. He is 28 already so I guess 40M (or slightly more) wouldn't be too bad, although I definitely want him to stay. 




 If that's true, then basically that means we can exchange Vidal for Draxler and Sandro. 




 If Vidal is leaving, Bayern will pay at least 40M right? So basically we get Sandro + 20M for Vidal. 




 Khedira will get a spot, I don't think he needs to find for one.

It's going to be Pogba, Khedira, Marchisio and (if Vidal leaves) Sandro (if he comes) or Pereyra.  




 I have unlimited data so I am good :) 




 Hi Professor,

Do you think getting an academic job is harder and harder nowadays? 




 I know quite a few adults who don't know how to ride the bike and they are completely okay with their lives. 




 Looks like a list of current managers only. I'd argue Ferguson, Lippi (among others) should be high on that list. 




 yeah, since the beginning of this year, she's been saying rate hikes, and its still not happening. 



















 Hope he plays a good season this year, he is a really good player. 









 Charrrr! 




 All 4th year stats courses will recognize ECO375 as an alternative for STA302, but Econ will not recognize 302, so you should take ECO375 if you want to take 4th year courses from both departments. 




 Frankly speaking, you can skip any of the two classes.

APM466 - Luis Seco's tests follow his notes online, while his lectures are basically like blah blah blah, so you certainly can skip one hour. He usually starts like around 9:20 anyway.

STA457 - I believe Keith is teaching this year. He has really good notes, so if you have a friend taking notes for you, then you are good to go. 




 I think having a PhD student writing a letter for you is okay. Technically, when they are hired to teach, they are considered sessional lecturers, so they should be comparable to most lecturers in some sense. Most likely, the schools you are applying to will not know names of lecturers anyway, so it doesn't really matter.  




 My guess would be somewhere between 3.5-3.7 would be a reasonable GPA. If you have 3.7+ with good marks in your core math/econ/stats courses, then you should be in good shape. 




 But one could argue one on a shitter team is likely to do well, e.g. Giovinco. 




 It's hard to compare players of different age groups. E.g. Buffon vs. Courtois vs Neuer, how do you compare these people for one position when there is like 10 years between each of them? 




 He played 52 games for Argentina, so basically he should be comparable to other Argentine players with similar national team caps. 




 Yeah, I would not use a club sub unless it's a question that really targets only fans from that club. Otherwise a lot of questions on /r/soccer basically should go to some club sub. 




 I added it in. 




 Anyone prefer human like me? 





























 Hope he lives up to the standard of Pirlo. 




 What is your definition for lesser known? 





























 Yeah, that was not my question. My question is (I guess I didn't say it clearly) is how does he compare to an average MLS player (e.g. not a DP). Is he substantially better, or just better by a bit? 




 pyro is not bad, agree that he is a cool guy. 




 Anyone like Medic here? 









 Does anyone know who good Giovinco is compared to other MLS players? 




 This may look fancy, but is not practical play really. So, I won't know if that's "great" and should be tried by other keepers. 





























 Very useful! 




 I know del Piero will return eventually, but is that gunna happen this season?
