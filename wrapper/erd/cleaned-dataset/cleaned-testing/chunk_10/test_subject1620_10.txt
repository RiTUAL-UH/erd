 I finished reading Matterhorn last week. I tried to start Dune yesterday which I had been meaning to read for a long time, I had to put it down though. It's almost like I'm feeling too emotionally connected to Matterhorn to the point that I'm still dreaming about it, that I can't immerse myself in a different story yet. Has anyone ever experienced something like this? What book did it for you? 




 I used to pretend a little dude was running across the trees/houses/hills outside my car window when I was riding passenger 




 I think I was maybe 3 at the time. I remember my babysitter giving me a bath before jumping out of the tub, running down the hall to my parents' room, and pooping on the floor. Then laughing a lot.

Not sure if this actually happened... 




 thanks for the info! 









 that's awesome, I'm glad I could help. I only posted this with the hope I could help at least one other person. Keep it up! 




 best of luck, I hope it helps you as much as it helped me! 




 hmmm, I can't think of any exercise in particular that would bother me. As I said before, I lift 3x a week (MWF) and run between 3-5 miles 3x a week on the other days.

Make sure to hydrate when you exercise, especially as the weather gets warmer.

Wish I had more insight into your specific problem 




 environment and community are along the lines of where I'm trying to take this, thanks
