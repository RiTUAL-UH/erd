 I just watched an expert on C-Span who wrote a book on The Bill of Rights.  She went back to the discussions at the time and said it was ALL about well-regulated militias and not at all about personal rights.  The militias were run by states and were designed to keep the states free of the potential tyrannical control of a central government.  http://www.c-span.org/person/?carolberkin

 Don't vote for Trump. 




 I was there. She was great as usual. 




 No, but I had a friend who was asked to drive while the cab driver was making out with her friend.  They were going to a restaurant in the Bay Area and were afraid they could nor get a cab back, so invited the driver to dine with them.  He hit it off with her friend and was asked to drive while they got in the back of the cab. If you knew my friend, you would be laughing on the floor to hear the story. 




 There is a bartender's union if you want to work in a major hotel.

 Finding a mentor.  I had the desire to learn and prepare, but needed guidance.   














 Beautiful!
 




 I remember a tv show (One Step Beyond or Alfred Hitchcock) about a kid who grew mushrooms in his basement.  They eventually took over his body.  To this day, I cannot eat mushrooms. 




 When will republican voters learn? 




 I wish we could have a rational debate on issues, but we can't!
 




 You might want to check the federally subsidized community health center also:

 I don't understand why US presidential candidates go to Europe. 




 I don't like what they have done to my store on Boulder Highway.  I went out of my way to go to Smith's to find some items last night.  My only hope is that they improve. 




 I read about a woman from the Bay Area that was planning to work on this also.  I wonder what ever happened to her efforts. 









 There was a song- Beachwood 45789, which was a phone number. 




 I'm not sure, but you can check with the clerks in the department. I ordered mine, but not sure if they were considered custom. 




 I liked Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman 




 Too bad people don't listen to what he says.  He makes total sense. 




 I bought mine at lowes or Home Depot. I bought ones that were not wood for under$100/ each and they have been fine. 




 I've been wTching Lunch with Bernie on Fstv for quite a while, and he is consistent. I like him.

 In this case, be grateful for Obama.  He would veto it.  I just love that this is the party that says that want to reduce the deficit.  They never do; they just have different priorities. 









 "..the Civil War was not fought over slavery but rather because the Union and President Abraham Lincoln acted without regard for the Constitution to accumulate power".  This sounds like today's twisted arguments over Obama. 

  



















 How many of those 16 million vote?  It didn't help in the last election. 




 It is easier to quit than you think.  I stopped for 8 yrs, started again, and kind of quit at will now.  I used patches.  The first time it took about 3 weeks, now I can do it in a week. 




 You can count the Koch brothers in that group. 




 I've been wondering about the net carb thing - since I have a habit of eating Atkins bars.  But I also read that carbs are carbs and net carbs is only a marketing tool.  I would be interested in hearing what others say about this. 




 I remember UMC having medical residencies in the 80's. 




 He's so creepy. 









 Second qilded age. 














 I read an article yesterday that Scripps Oceanography believes that Lake Mead will be dry by 2022.  Sorry I'm too lazy to find the link, but it was through reddit. 




 Right.  And most people are not paying attention.  All they know is that they like the idea of "smaller government".  How many people don't even bother to vote.   




 Traveled; gone to law school. 




 Treasonous. 




 Since the Affordable Health Care Act, Nevada has been hiring eligibility workers.  It's a tough job, but the state does not discriminate on age.  https://nvapps.state.nv.us/NEATS/Recruiting/ViewAnnouncement.aep?recruitmentId=23887 




 Nice job. 




 I use this link frequently when there is discussions on over-population.  http://www.upworthy.com/a-smartypants-scientist-makes-an-easy-analogy-about-our-planet-and-now-im-scared 




 Or Plato for that matter. 




 I wish that Occupy would have been more like the Tea Party in that the Tea Party turned out the vote.  We would be in a different place today had Occupy been more political. 




 Facebook has a site Las Vegas, the Good ol' Days, where tons of pictures are posted.  The folks there are a little older than I am though (and I am not young!)
 




 Las Vegas, NV, not CA.  In any case, it was more like the movie American Graffiti growing up there. 









 Home Depot has spray cans which make it fairly easy. Color can be a problem as whites don't always match. 




 I remember when Nevada voted in a bond issue for prisons and against one for schools. Now those prisons are closed and we have no choice on schools. We need them. 




 How did social security numbers even get in the emails?  I wouldn't put mine on a email.  I feel like I am missing something also. 




 But that's what they would like! 




 I was thinking we all live in our individual bubbles, and it really is difficult to change people's minds (although it can  happen). 




 I picked up a hitchhiker one night decades ago.  He had a big paper bag.  When I let him off, he reached in the bag and gave me a baggie of weed. 




 I took a continuing ed class a few years ago on retiring out of the country.  It's a little hazy, but I think the teacher said you can buy medical insurance cheaply in Mexico, but not after age 80.  Then they will not sell any insurance to you. 




 How did he win the last election?  Was it just low turnout? 




 Wow. I want to visit. 









 It think it is crazy to put conspiracy theories all in one group.  Some events are results of conspiracies, some not.

 




 I think about this often.  I have thought of the groups as tribes, and if there is a connection to heritage and where we came from.  You find diffrent views within families however, so I'm not sure how it would hold up.
 




 Democrat or Republican?  I think there is room at the local level, or more opportunities if you want to travel.  I would make myself known at offices of elected officials and the party you are associated with.  You could get hired as a representative or hear about a 501(C)(4) position associated with policy.  Find a new candidate, do some fundraising to pay for your salary, get your candidate elected, then start your own consulting firm.  You could start out as a political writer like Jon Ralston.  You can get government jobs.  If you are a Democrat, check out Organized Karma.   If it doesn't look like there is potential in the long-term, go to law school.  I had a poli sci degree and worked mostly in nonprofits, but there were other options had I pursued them. 




 I wasn't able to pull up the article, but I can say I would like to live on a luxury cruise ship for a few years. 




 In the past, employment was used to distribute wealth.   I think we need to view a new way to distribute wealth. 




 Check this out if you really want to be convinced:

 Republicans will treat ANY Democratic president as radical, too liberal, etc.  In many regards, Clinton was one of them - a southern white male, but you would have thought at the time that he was the devil. 




 Not a small luxury, but I'd take that round-the-world cruise for a year. 




 If you don't mind staying in customer service, try c3connect.com.  Also, if you don't mind paperwork, the welfare office has been hiring like crazy since Obamacare.  nv.gov - family services specialist 1.  
It's a tough job, but stable and full time. 




 I agree.  It scares me. 




 Republicans now control 30 states.  They can change the rules in these states how delegates are allocated: http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/11/18/3593173/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-gops-newest-plan-to-rig-the-2016-presidential-election/
Remember, these guys stop at nothing and have deep pockets. 




 Am I the only one who thinks about overpopulation? 



















 Congratulations!
 




 It was slow and easy-going.  We entered the fast-lane starting the 70's. 




 Roger Springs is cool.  Just don't drink the water! http://hotspringsoak.com/rogers-hot-springs.html 




 What I want to see is a statute of Obama with his birth certificate in his hand and a big grin on his face.  Maybe giving the bird to the right wing  might be cool too. 









 I wish we could start a reddit coop and buy/install our own at a reduced rate. 




 No clue, huh? 




 I'm a liberal and I agree.  I'm not sure what we can do differently and I think about it often.  You don't want the unintended consequenses. 




 Also, the military was totally socialist.  Now it's probably half and half.  We have a lot of private contractors involved with the military. 




 I worked as a job counselor for 8 summers for a federally-subsidized Summer Youth Program where about 1,000 kids worked for nonprofits, schools, etc. for 8 weeks during the summer.  Some even worked as firefighters.  This program operated for years and Congress kept reducing it to almost nothing,  It gave young people the opportunity to see how the working world works, and many of those kids went on to become successful, productive citizens.  I think it was worth it.  They also had a short-term program for adults - and when the economy was down, more money was allocated.  You may not like it, but it keeps people in the job market, the money gets spent in the community and we all do better.  I hate this trajectory we are on.  All the money now goes to the rich in terms of tax cuts.  And contrary to what many believe, they are not necessarily the job-creators.  We subsidize the rich with their low-paying salaries through tax benefits, and in making up the difference in low-wages with welfare, food stamps and medical. 




 Keep saying that while all the tax breaks go to billionaires, and you end up working for peanuts.  We are all going to be poor at the hands of Republicans.  They don't support whites - they support billionaires! 




 Thank you for stating this. 









 Amazing how that is probably NG's most famous cover. 




 They wear me out watching them.  They have deep enough pockets. 




 It wouldn't be that high if businesses and lawmakers  hadn't work to bring down wages. 




 I don't know, but loosening regulations usually results in ripoffs. 




 Nursing school might be cheaper here.  You can become a nurse in 18 months at NV State College if you have the prereqs.  You can always take the skills back to Washington.  Cost of living is cheaper here also.  I would love to have my grandparents house on Queen Anne Hill overlooking Elliot Bay.  It was sold for $10,000 after they died, and would sell for $1.5 million today. 



















 They will try to impeach him instead. 




 He was the minority leader before he was majority leader.  He was very skilled and will do it again.  He does support support black and hispanics that have solid membership in the party-but not 94%.  I don't know where you got that number.   




 Silver does it to my skin. 



















 I think that is a great idea. 




 I learned this lesson when I was young.  We had a march in our town supporting welfare clients who had been cut off the rolls.  An anti-welfare group was started.  I ran in to the leader of the anti-welfare group at our legal aid office.  He had had a heart attack, his wife left him, he lost his house and was looking for free legal help.  It comes around. 









 The Republican Party is 90% white.  We should be calling it the White Person's Party.  Romney's vote was 96% white.   I post these numbers all the time on reddit because I was so shocked when I initially read them.  Young people are only less republican because they they are a more diverse group.  Young whites still voted for Romney.   




 But do you want to impose your values on everyone else?  I'm a progressive and I support your rights to have your values.  But don't impose them on me. 




 This woman seems crazy.  I just don't get it. 




 Are you kidding?  What war did he get us in to?  What economy did he crash? 




 Very cool. 




 They don't see it that way however. 




 That is what question 3 is all about.  I believe the tax is a percent OVER 1 million income, so if you made 1,000.001, you would be taxed 20 cents.  I don't think that is so bad. 




 Hotels have lobbyists which come out of the woodwork the minute a lottery is suggested.  




 I voted yes on all three.  The legislature is unable to pass a tax to help schools.  They had time through many sessions to come up with other options.  When they don't do anything,  we have to wait another two years until they meet again.  In the meantime, nothing is done.  We have to do what they are incapable of doing.   25% of the children in the schools live in poverty.  I do not have children, but believe that all children need a good education.  Teachers also have a great investment in their education and need to be paid a decent wage also.  I believe they cannot recruit enough teachers because the starting salary is so low.  This is crazy.

Mining has not been taxed since the State created its constitution. They had lobbyists even then and wrote it into the state constitution that they be exempt from taxes.  They have had their free ride and now need to contribute to the state's wellbeing also.  

I voted for the Court of Appeals, but do not have a passion for the issue.  I just can imagine that the other courts are backed up too.  




 They have been great with my personal banking also. 




 A photo area where friends can get their photos taken. 




 I'm not sure I would take my girlfriend to Sherrie's ranch. 




 If you don't mind staying off the strip, you can get a better price and enough to rent a car.  https://www.bconnectedonline.com/resnetf.php?STEHOTEL 




 Bingo. 




 I've always had the suspicion that this was the case. 




 The numbers are all over the board. 




 It's a more beautiful city than I thought it would be.  I went to a convention there earlier in the year.  The house are cute and the neighborhoods look better than mine if you don't mind seeing a few burned houses in every neighborhood. 









 Pretty much sums it up. 




 Good luck.  I live in the area and will keep my eyes open.  Do check at the pound.  (By the way, I was ticketed last week by Animal Control for letting my dog out in front of my house.  She never goes more than 1 house away, but someone complained. I guess she would lick them to death.) 




 I saw you!  Good luck too! 




 I'm older than anyone here.  I would move in a heartbeat if I didn't have a husband who doesn't want to leave my zipcode.
 









 I remember when abortions were illegal everywhere.  If you could afford it, you could fly to Mexico for a legal abortion (or elsewhere).  If you couldn't, you opted for a local illegal one.  I knew women in both categories.  I knew a young woman who was blind-folded in a hotel room.  Another ended up in the hospital for a DNC.  One died. 




 Guys (and some females) like to view themselves as "tough".  It's absurd really. 




 I'm sorry to hear this.   




 I read his books in the 70's and I hear Hillary did her master's thesis on him (he was from Chicago and she was also from Illinois).  He was a successsful union organizer and his the threat of his tactics were enough to win issues.  His tactics were fun for members to participate in by members.  Example:  The mayor of Chicago loved the opera.  He threatened to have a picnic serving beans to union members and providing them free tickets to attend the opera.  Never had to pull off the picnic; the threat was enough to win his way. 




 This guy is crazy.  He was all over Clinton and his poor staff who couldn't afford the legal challenges and stress.   I was anxious to see how he would be under GW Bush.  Hardly heard a word.  Now he is apoletic about Obama. 




 Pioche is kind of fun.  Also a little lake there is you like fishing.  They have community fairs several times a year, and people come from all over to attend.    




 The supremes gave GW Bush the presidency.   




 You can ignore reality if you want. 




 I see volunteers hired all the time also. 




 I'd prefer to beat them however.
