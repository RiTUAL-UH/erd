 I have removed this post because while this is a lovely post, it doesn't quite fit with the theme of Thalassophobia.  




 And we're working hard to try and squash the reposts that don't meet the three month criteria. Each submission is now being reviewed by a mod and while it might take a bit of time, we do check every post to see if it is a repost. However, there are some that we miss. If you find a repost, please report it to us. It will add weight to our final decision. 




 I agree completely and that's what we're going for. I feel that the subtle outline of something seen from the corner of your eye adds so much to a photo of the ocean. And even some animals in general, but this sub is quickly becoming /r/sharkweek and /r/seacreatures. We're hoping to find a happy medium between the two. 









 I agree. For critters there is always /r deepseacreatures and /r/TheDepthsBelow. 




 Hello everyone! Recently we've seen an influx of animals being posted to /r/thalassophobia that aren't really thalassophobia inducing. Starting Monday, 27 July 2015, we will begin a week-long trial of removing most animal posts. We understand that some sea creatures are central to some people's thalassophobia and those that fit into that grouping will be allowed. However, photos and videos of just sea creatures with no explanation for the fear it can induce will be removed. During our trial run, all posts will be reviewed with more scrutiny. As usual, please note the rules in the sidebar with regards to reposts. If you're looking to see when the last time a picture was posted, I would recommend using [KarmaDecay](https://www.karmadecay.com) and even just reddit's simple search function can help. If you find something violating the rules please use the report button and let us know. We do review each report and take appropriate actions.

Thank you.

Edit: We now have a button in the sidebar to view posts that have been deemed Exemplary 




 While this is nice, I've removed it as it doesn't fit into the category of thalassophobia.

 I'll be talking to the other mods about this and seeing what we can do to curtail the amount of creature posts on here.

 It appears that you've been shadowbanned. I would recommend you [contact the admins](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com) about it.

 Might I suggest a cross post to /r/schweiz?

 I know we can as long as the hanger is rolled back. We almost did that with the navy on deployment 




 Always nice to see another Coastie on here! I spent three years on the Munro 




 I loved being on a 378. I miss being out to sea. 




 Fantastic guide

 He has lost a considerable amount of weight. I remember him taking about it on the nerdist podcast once.
