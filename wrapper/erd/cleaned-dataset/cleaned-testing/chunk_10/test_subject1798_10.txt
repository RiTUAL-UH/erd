 And how's Louisiana's economy doing after all that giveaway? Still next to last? 









 This guy only saved himself and his family. Other Chinook pilots overloaded their helicopters with refugees, then went back again and again. One friend who was helping unload helicopters during the operation said that one pilot came with in with just his motorcycle in the helicopter. Everybody on the deck was pissed because he didn't help bring anybody else in. 




 If the intent was to scare people from joining the military then why did he go to the reserve center? It's not clear to me that that was the intent. Maybe he just chose the targets because it was low security, like a burglar who chooses targets that don't have security systems. Furthermore, he didn't target recruits, all of the casualties are current members. In Iraq, the terrorist intimidation against voters targeted the voters themselves. ISIS targets specific groups like police and military officers, among others, but all who fit a particular political agenda. 




 Those are elements of terrorism but not the only ones.

From Merriam-Webster (emphasis mine)

Full Definition of TERRORISM:  the *systematic* use of terror especially as a means of coercion

Or better yet, the Oxford English Dictionary:

a. gen. The unofficial or unauthorized use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims; (originally) such practices used by a government or ruling group (freq. through paramilitary or informal armed groups) in order to maintain its control over a population; (now usually) such practices used by a clandestine or expatriate organization as a means of furthering its aims.

b. In extended or weakened use: the instilling of fear or terror; intimidation, coercion, bullying.

Obviously, instilling fear or terror is broad; any shooting does that. I don't see that the motive was to intimidate, coerce or bully. It was an angry, unstable man. 




 That's a better way of stating the question that I was posing:  It comes down to intent. If the shooter was trying to intimidate or coerce, he didn't do a very good job. And he left nothing declaring political ideology or goals the way Roof's manifesto did.

I see this is a single angry, crazy guy who wanted to leave this Earth and take a few people with him. The reason for choosing his target may be political but it's not terrorism. 




 I listened to the Diane Rheem show today and one person said "Obviously, it's terrorism." No, not obvious to me. Not all politically motivated attacks are terrorism. Who is he trying to scare? The U.S. Marine Corps? If he wanted terrorism, there are much higher profile targets that would yield far better returns:  Boston bombing, DC snipers are just two examples. 




 Add projections if you have that data available. 




 It's pretty easy to rationalize legally. A hospital doesn't just send people down to Costco once a week to pick up supplies. They are all delivered by distributors. They also have a lot of fixed costs:  Insurance, HVAC, janitors, infrastructure, waste disposal, etc. Many of those businesses that cater to hospitals also tend to carry higher-than-normal fixed costs such as insurance that are passed on up the chain. It all adds up.

But more to your point:  Hospitals make money. Some of them make a lot of money, even the ones that are supposed to be "non-profit." 









 Schools rely on test scores because nobody has come up with a better way that isn't overly fraught with arbitrary and contentious judgment. 




 That's a really long name. Kind of hard to remember too, and doesn't fit on a menu board too well. 




 In case pay-walled:

**The Mythical Connection Between Immigrants and Crime**

*Newcomers to the U.S. are less likely than the native population to commit violent crimes or be incarcerated.*

By JASON L. RILEY
July 14, 2015 7:33 p.m. ET

Is the conversation that Republicans want to have about immigration any more serious than the one Democrats want to have about race?

The Republican presidential field sports no shortage of individuals capable of speaking intelligently about Americas broken immigration system. Sens. Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham have drafted legislation on the issue. Jeb Bush co-wrote an entire book on the subject. And Rick Perry ran a border state with the nations second-largest immigrant population for 14 years. So why is Donald Trump, whose comments about immigrants and crime are as ugly as they are uninformed, doing all the talking?

The candidates who expect to outlast Mr. Trump in the primaries are no doubt eyeing his supporters. But Republicans would do better to focus on swing voters, whom they might lose if Mr. Trumps position on immigration is perceived as the GOPs. Mr. Trump is bringing heat to a debate that needs more light, and other candidates have an opportunity to provide it.

They might start by pointing out that numerous studies going back more than a century have shown that immigrantsregardless of nationality or legal statusare less likely than the native population to commit violent crimes or to be incarcerated. A new report from the Immigration Policy Center notes that while the illegal immigrant population in the U.S. more than tripled between 1990 and 2013 to more than 11.2 million, FBI data indicate that the violent crime rate declined 48%which included falling rates of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and murder. Likewise, the property crime rate fell 41%, including declining rates of motor vehicle theft, larceny/robbery, and burglary.

A separate IPC paper from 2007 explains that this is not a function of well-behaved high-skilled immigrants from India and China offsetting misdeeds of Latin American newcomers. The data show that for every ethnic group without exception, incarceration rates among young men are lowest for immigrants, according to the report. This holds true especially for the Mexicans, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans who make up the bulk of the undocumented population.

It also holds true in states with large populations of illegal residents. A 2008 report by the Public Policy Institute of California found that immigrants are underrepresented in the prison system. The incarceration rate for foreign-born adults is 297 per 100,000 in the population, compared [with] 813 per 100,000 for U.S.-born adults, the study concludes. The foreign-born, who make up roughly 35% of Californias adult population, constitute 17% of the state prison population.

High-profile incidents, like the recent arrest of a Mexican national in the horrific shooting death of a young woman in San Francisco, can give the impression that immigrants are more likely to commit violent crimes. But the alleged killer is no more representative of Mexican immigrants than Dylann Roof is representative of white people.

Every immigrant here illegally has already broken a law, though that doesnt mean they are predisposed to crime. In a 2005 paper, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago reported that more recently arrived immigrants are even less crime-prone than their predecessors. In 1980 the incarceration rate of foreign nationals was about one percentage point below natives. A decade later that had fallen to a little more than a percentage point, and by 2000 it was almost three percentage points lower.

Mr. Trump wants to have an unserious debate about immigration, one that involves scaring voters and scapegoating newcomers for crime problems that are mostly homegrown. The liberal press corps will continue indulging him because hes entertaining, and they know his bluster helps Hillary Clinton.
But it behooves other Republicans to raise the level of discourse. After six years of President Obama fluctuating between doing nothing on immigration and issuing legally suspect executive actions that are still tied up in the courts, voters will want to know where the GOP candidates stand.

How do you balance border security and labor-market demand? Should relatives of people already here continue to be given an immigration preference? Is it time to move toward a skills-based immigration system similar to Canadas? How should the federal government treat border states and cities that bear the upfront costs of illegal entries? Is walling off the southern border feasible? Would it make the U.S. safer? And what should be done about the estimated 12 million undocumented people already living here?

Votersincluding the more than 40% of swing Hispanic voters that George W. Bush won in 2004will be paying attention not only to what the candidates say about border issues but also how they say it. Tone matters, and Mr. Trump sounds like someone eager to spurn voters that the Republicans likely need next year. Most people agree that illegal immigration ought to be reduced. The question is not whether its a problem but how to solve it. Its time for some adults in the GOP presidential race to weigh in.

 If it tastes good, eat it. If it don't, try something else. To each their own. 




 I bet he has a badge and everything. 




 Then what do you call a hard shell? 




 A restaurant where I live melts cheese on their tortillas first on the grill before throwing the meat on. They do this on the flat top, then they plate it. I think it's an improvement over traditional mexican tacos, which are already good. 




 You don't know the story and neither do I. But having been in business for over 30 years, I can say that you don't just fire somebody because you want to make a change. You fire somebody because you want to make a change and *they don't want to.* 




 That's one of the big issues. Even if Tsipras can get reforms passed, there is no trust that he will keep them in place. I do not see a good ending with his coalition in power. 




 Thanks for reposting. I forget that about WSJ. 




 You Canadians just have it too easy. Still, can you imagine trying to back into a 45 degree parking spot? My first question is WHY? 









 The letter-writer conveniently forgot to mention that it's 45 degree parking. 




 This is not parallel parking. It's 45 degree parking, which is all over downtown Portsmouth. 




 When you go up against irrational people, it doesn't matter if you arm yourself with science and logic; the irrational always win. If you say "the sky is blue" and they say "no, it's not," you might as well stop. You are not going to win.

The vast majority of policy makers are irrational and scientifically illiterate. Stop now. You are not going to win. 




 Personally, I've given up trying. We are past the point of no return anyways. Hope you enjoyed life at the top. 




 I've stopped wearing watches except when going to functions. That said, my Patek Phillipe that I purchased twenty years ago when I got a "real paycheck" hasn't lost a dime of value. I'm not sure that the Apple Watch--even the gold one--will be able to say that. 




 TL,DW 




 My hair stylist is Russian. She's a MILF and she is hot. I mean insanely fucking hot. She is devoted to her man, who is Ukranian (she's from Moscow). Sure, it's a hair salon so she's dressed to kill, of course, but she has shown me her vacation photos on her phone and she always, always looks un-fucking-believably-amazing for her man--nails, hair, makeup, heels, the works. On fucking vacation. The women walking around in baggy shorts and tank tops? They're American. They can do that because too many men have low blue pill standards. 




 Open wheel racing is just terrifying. 




 I thought it was a 12-sided 2-dimensional shape (what others have pointed out is actually a dodecagon). So I thought I was correct and found I was wrong. 




 When she was 4 I had to type the search term for them and read the answers to them but my goal was to help her learn how to learn. I started with shapes, animals, simple objects (house, tree, flower, etc). I would find a drawing they could copy with crayon and paper. The "clipart" option of Google image search was perfect for this. And it was fun for me and especially my wife. 




 Hey thanks. I printed one and I'll try to make a save. 

Update: Do you know how hard it is to cut one of those things out? 




 Ah, I understand. Spheres will have voids between them and a dodecahedron doesn't. Thanks for the explanation. 




 Not knowing anything about this, why is it harder to use a sphere? 




 I play a game with my six year old where I give her a topic to research on Google and she writes a basic report or draws it, depending on the subject. We were driving somewhere yesterday and talking about shapes, the difference between a pyramid and a cone, trapezoids, rhombus, pentagons, octagons. She knows all of those, no problem. So I try to make it harder and the only thing I can think of is a dodecahedron.

"Do you know what a dodecahedron is?" I asked her. 
"No. What's a dodeca... wait what did you say?" she replied.
"Do-dec-a-he-dron." I repeated this a few times until she got it. "When we get home I would like you to draw it for me." 

We get home, I give her my iPad, write the word down on a piece of paper for her to type into Google, and go into my office to do some work. She gets out her crayons and paper. About 10 minutes later I hear her crying. I walk into her room, there's a couple of crumpled pieces of paper on the floor and she's bawling. "IT'S THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER DRAWN!!!!"

I thought it was a simple two-dimensional shape, like an octagon with more sides. I look on the iPad screen and see a twelve-sided, THREE DIMENSIONAL object. Aw fuck, I'm an idiot.

TL;DR: Tried to make my six year old draw a dodecahedron. Didn't know it was three dimensional. Made my kid cry and feel like a loser. Now both of us feel like losers. 














 The Presidential election is for the state delegates to the Electoral College. It's a state-run election, as are all elections involving at-large voters. 




 I find it amazing that 25% of Americans don't believe that humans and dinosaurs walked the Earth together. 




 It was tongue in cheek, glad you understood that! 




 The feeling of cool or cold can be created with simple thermodynamic principles:  Wet your skin with a spray bottle or towel and use a fan to increase evaporation. The evaporating water will draw heat from your skin. 




 Sometimes understanding takes even longer. 




 To observe that there is wealth disparity does not mean that it elicits feelings of envy or resentment. It appears that you can't accept that there are people who are very happy with their life as it is, who are perfectly content with simple comforts in a modest home and the ability to care for their family, who don't feel any urge to accumulate numbers in a bank account, square footage, or numbers of homes. I truly feel sorry for you and your seeming entrapment. I hope you find peace in your life one day. 




 I don't have any pitchforks, not at the ready or otherwise. It was an example of wealth disparity, the ability to purchase fair market value for a top-1% home and throw away the home. I find it interesting that you seem to think my post carried any animosity. It says a lot about your psyche. Why do you think I feel any jealousy? Are you projecting? 




 Sometimes the originals fade pretty badly due to bad thermal paper. Maybe a particular place won't accept it but it's worth a shot and it's better than not having a receipt at all. 









 I also find that when I do this I am a lot less likely to have a pre-bedtime snack. 




 I've done that when I've been lazy and I miss about 1/4 of the time. Plus I'd want to be more precise if I'm hanging something like a 70" TV or grandma's Renoir mounted in a 18th century gold leaf frame. 




 OK, no more party balloons for my kid. 




 What's the current best guess on when we run out of exploitable helium reserves? 




 I have an IT business. Let's say I offer new clients 3 months of free IT but I ask my technicians to work for nothing during that time. Kind of the same? 




 Percentage-wise, how much of the loss of helium is attributable to  human activity? 




 I only brought up an example of wealth disparity. You should seek those answers and solutions from others who are way smarter than me. Even Milton Friedman acknowledged the dangers of income disparity and he discussed possible solutions in his book *Capitalism and Freedom*. 




 Nope, not envious at all. I consider myself fortunate. I have a successful small business that yields a comfortable upper middle class lifestyle, a fantastic wife and kid and that I can afford to send to a great private school. I'm probably around the top 5% of annual income. But I think about income disparity because my company does a lot of business with the one-percenters, people who collect multi-million dollar homes. 




 It's a remark about income disparity, which is one of the topics of the article above. Construction workers, electricians, plumbers get thrown a few bones but macro economic studies have shown that middle class wages are stagnant even though productivity has increased. The beneficiaries have been those at the top. 









 Here's an example of what Sanders is talking about:

I'm an IT consultant and I was talking to a client yesterday. She and her family are wealthy, top 1% certainly, and are building a new home in a gated golf community nearby but it's not complete yet. They recently sold their existing home so had to move into a rental. It sold for $2.5 Million. It was a nice home on a nice sized wooded lot but nothing too out of the ordinary for the community (this is a VERY wealthy community).

I found out yesterday that the new owners completely razed the 3-level 10,000 square foot home and the adjacent four car garage with guest house above. They plan to build something new.

The buyers essentially paid $2.5 Million for a lot. 




 It wasn't the act of racism that got everybody talking, it was the Mass murder by gun. Did you somehow miss that? 




 Like the President remarked, it happens more in America than anywhere else so yes, I think there's room for improvement.

 You may know this only if you've had training to obtain a permit. Many states (such as Texas) now want to dispense with the training and permit requirement altogether and give everyone an automatic right to carry a concealed weapon with absolutely no requirement to be trained on its use and the responsibilities that come with carrying. 




 I'll just be clever, heheheeohshit 




 I'm a former AMA and AHRMA road racer. I learned the hard way in road racing that anger has no place in motorcycling or else you're going to be in for a short ride and a long day. 




 You missed the point. It doesn't matter what the initial act was. Two angry people. One on a motorcycle, one in a car. Neither backs down. Both escalate. WHO WILL LOSE? The answer is in the article.

Me:  I'm a rider. I have 2 Ducatis and 2 Nortons. Former AMA and AHRMA road racer. I learned the hard way in road racing that you have no business being angry on a motorcycle or else you're in for a short ride. All motorcyclists have had shitty things happen but you have to be defensive on the road. There is a comment from a fellow rider (it's the top one at the time I'm writing this response) that really sums it up well:  Be happy you're OK. 




 If you're angry, don't kick somebody's car because they might use that as a weapon and kill you, especially if you're on a motorcycle. Stupid navy assdick. 




 Crosswind landings are pretty normal. I'm a pilot and it's a normal part of training. Large commercial transports have a lot of momentum. Your job is to make the aircraft makes a straight approach even if your heading is skewed by the crosswind. Then at the last moment you use rudder and aileron to straighten out. You see in the video the pilot applying rudder. Flare and make sure the mains touch first and the aircraft's momentum will help ensure that you straighten out when both mains touch down. It may not feel great to the passengers but it's not really that dangerous.

I once flew (as a passenger) into Taipei while a major tropical storm was bearing down, with a quartering crosswind. Very turbulent but the landing was fine. 














 So what's her club? Name it without looking it up. Didn't think you could. 




 No kidding. Why would you expect him to know? Pretty damned arrogant of her. Who is she? What is her club?

 CO*_2_* in the 500-1000 ppm range. Good luck.

  most sites that use it have that bootstrap feeling to it

OP didn't give enough details to judge but depending on the content, it may or may not be what OP is going for. Conformity can be good in many cases (B2B sites, for example). It's definitely not in others (creative professionals or cutting-edge consumer products, for example). 




 Startup founder and tech recruiter here. There are two sides to this. A degree from a prestigious engineering program doesn't necessarily mean you know your shit any more than a HS grad but it does signal to a recruiter that you know how to work your ass off. You could get lucky with a HS grad and get one who knows their shit *and* works their ass off. You just have to dig deep into their background, maybe put them on a longer probationary period, etc. 




 There was a study recently that indicated Asians are basically penalized ~~150~~ 50 points on their SATs. I'll see if I can dig it up....

 Bush went to war even after weapons inspectors found absolutely nothing in 2003. Here's an article:

*"The weapons inspection teams in Iraq have visited breweries and former nuclear plants, and raided missile factories and pharmaceutical production lines. They have examined former weapons factories and interviewed scientists and university technicians. As of yesterday they had checked 230 sites in all. If one is to believe the few inspectors who have been prepared to be interviewed anonymously, they have found absolutely nothing.*

*Nuclear weapons sites that the British and the Americans claimed as late as last September had been reactivated have been revealed as rusting, disabled shambles. It may be that Iraq has squirrelled away its most portable weapons and components. But as one inspector complained to the LA Times last week, they had found 'zilch'.*

*He is not alone in his assessment. Another inspector in Baghdad complained to Newsday : 'If our goal is to catch them with their pants down, we are definitely losing. We haven't found an iota of concealed material yet.'*

 The industry term is *supply chain* and yes, China is where the supply chain is at so it makes a lot of sense for companies to do final assembly in China as well. A few companies have tinkered with doing final assembly in the U.S. for political reasons but it's very challenging to do so. If you make a engineering or design change, China can move that change into production in a week or less. If assembly is in the U.S. your parts have to ship overseas and may sit in customs for a while. It can take a month or more. In China if you get a bad batch of a certain part you can often have another source supply it almost immediately. In the U.S., again it has to get shipped across the ocean.

If you want to rebuild manufacturing in America you have to rebuild it from the very lowest parts--the raw plastic pellets, the nuts and bolts. I don't see that happening unless the Republican party agrees to higher tariffs. 




 This is no different than walking through The Venetian Casino.
