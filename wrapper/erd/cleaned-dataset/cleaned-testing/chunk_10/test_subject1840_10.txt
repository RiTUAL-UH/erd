 I just  did mini tut form lifehacker  http://lifehacker.com/disable-ads-on-youtube-by-enabling-a-youtube-experiment-1171802208 but still I got 5s ad on the beginning each video.
I used to have AdBolck but from the moment google started paying ransom to app owner worked much worst. Now new version of firefox filtering quite a lot of this stuff. 




 I hope I wrote clearly my point - however: English isn't my first language. If is something unclear, misspelled or grammar mistakes - let me know, I will edit this post. Thx a lot.

Couple  weeks ago google made announcement in media that youtube got almost any profits. Next day I noticed that on each youtube video instead of usual links to Adwords on bottom of video or clip with option out after 5s, it starts with 5s video clip. 
After couple weeks almost each video started with 20s without option to leave ad. Yesterday I noticed most videos starts with 30s ad clip. Is google testing users patience? I wonder if this is usual treatment or just "personalized search results" made for my user profile. 
 









 That's my favorite stuff I waiting for. 






















































 And this is very , very bad move of Microsoft.
