 Sorry about my ignorance but it is not as common as yugioh's show  




 It has an anime series, while Magic doesn't. 

It is more common among my community than Magic.

Also, I rather not play so many card games, since I need to make room for other type of activites.  




 because it included many amendments. Of course, Congress does this a lot to many bills.

 Keep in mind, they pretty much only passed a short-term solution, so it is not tech FAILED. 









 Subsidized is another form of protectionism, right? Instead of taxing inhibiting trade, you just give money to businesses to cover costs. 




 I am in the same position lol 




 Run galaxy cyclone  




 Academica is coming after you and turn into cards!  




 No field barrier? 




 Igknights maybe because they will be the new hot deck after Clash of Rebellions is released. 




 Trade deficits take away from GDP because of exports - imports in the GDP equation. Are you suggesting that Greece should also maintain a trade deficit while in their budget ands fiscal deficits? Germany after ww1 had to run trade surpluses to repay its debts to foreign countries. 




 Republicans and conservatives used to be pro tariffs to protect U.S. manufacturing. Democrats used to be the anti tariff to export farm goods. 




 Economics is not a proven science. There are many schools of thought and they debate like politicians. 

Microeconomics =/= Macroeconomics. 

Economic Theory sometimes doesn't predict human behavior because we are not rational. = Behavioral Economics. 




 Of course... Trade Deficits don't matter, right? We should continue to run trade deficits by not doing anything to reduce imports and increase exports. Most of our free-trade agreements have increased our trade deficits with other countries. Will TPP reduce this deficit? How can TPP be the most progressive trade bill according to Obama, yet conservative enough for Republicans? Supposedly, all the rules and standards will be enforceable, so companies don't outsource as often and countries with those outsourced jobs have to improve conditions. If everything is level again, where is the "comparative advantage"? 




 any thoughts on the budget? 














 haha It has. Those pesky government public sector unions are the problem for the commuter rail lol 









 Yang Zing rise in power :) 









 you do realize that it is early in the race right? 




 Hillary Clinton should be concerned about Chafee because if her voters split between him and Clinton, then Sanders might be the top candidate.  




 Lincoln is a good replacement for Hillary's spectrum of voters, who don't want to support her, but indirectly helps Sanders to rise in the polls because the moderate wing is split. 

Jim Webb is for those truely Conservative Democrats, which cmon... is like a nearly extinct species in the Democratic Party. DINOs! LOL

Sanders just needs to worry about O'Malley splitting his votes or hope Chafee vs Clinton gets intense for him to continue to rise. 




 They will probably delay the ban list until September and say that we had to follow OCG rules. lol 




 This was July 2nd 2ND! @ND @#132. We need a more recent update on the ban list.  









 Not a good response from a person who works for Konami. At least Konami as a company can try to make an article or an actual update on the ban list?  




 Wait until clash or rebellions because the upcoming maybe ban list might hit the current meta decks so previous sets might not be worth a lot unless you want those archetypes for cheap.  




 Ethan Finlay got subbed big time 




 Because Democrats are crowded in urban areas which is easy to pack. However in my blue state, we have a democratic supermajority yet the districts seem fairly sectioned off by region, but each region has a small major city, so it kind of keeps the democratic majority. 




 Independent Greeks, who are a populist right wing party in coalition, might not agree with this deal because they are euro skeptic. They might have supported the coalition to hope that it fails so that they might leave the euro. 




 if you looked closely at the no vote, many of them wanted to reject the past deal, but wanted to stay within the European Union.  









 Good for European Producers, who want cheaper costs in other countries.  




 Wouldn't Greece benefit from leaving the Euro and switching to a new currency? Now, Greece is able to control its monetary policy and well look attractable for outsourcers from other countries because their currency would be very weak, if they keep political stability. Also, Russia/BRICs could lend some help because Russia wants a good place to export goods and Greece has a trade deficit problem. 




 Yep. :\ 




 Transferred out gio and then he scores a hat trick :/ 




 True but there is no benefit since both players are on 0 points.  




 Just an interesting statistic that I would like to point out.  




 Peay gets 3 points, but low in piority. Villafina doesn't start, but my highest piority is Woodberry with 0 points. LOL

Maybe a rule change where if your bench player gets 0 points and one of your starting players doesn't start, then it will not sub in the 0 point player, but rather the highest scoring player next in piority.  




 New England United because we unite all of New England. 

Nevermind, Liverpool Owners hate Manchester United 




 Well. They think it is practical, after all, most Americans rely on cars and airports, but the problem is that there is congestion in urban highways during rush hour and congestion in the air terminals. Also, you can only build so many lanes and runways before you don't have room.  




 It requires zoning rules to favor new development. Houston would need to have a more density oriented economy, after they build the subways for the subways to work and the economy to function.  




 After you build the subways, build high density apartments to increase supply of houses to combat high housing prices. :) 




 Progressive Conservatism?

Compassionate Conservatism?

Centre-Right?

Right-Wing Socialists?

Moderate Conservatives?

Liberal Conservatives?  




 If you could wait a month in advance, then Synchron Extreme structure deck might gain some traction in the meta. We don't know the ban list either, so we don't know what archetypes will get hit or gain power.  




 No. They are treated as monster cards, since they become spells when placed in their zones, but more specifically they are just pendulum cards.  









 They dislike rail because they would rather have us build more highways and airports. 




 We need a candidate for president, who will put forth a plan to build highspeedrail across the USA. 




 Goldwater basically said that extremism is good for liberty and moderation is no virtue. 




 If the sounders have so many seats available, then I am pretty sure that most of the demand has been satisfied for soccer at any price. Also, the sounders have been in this league for a while, so any potential casual fans have been reached. 




 You would think that there would a huge demand for young workers, since people retire so earlier but youth unemployment rate is also high. 




 Even if Lampard doesn't start, Villa could get Lampard's service in the future. So it is expected that villa will do well in he future, if Lampard does well. 




 Aliens 




 Ouch to all the players who transferred him in lol 




 Kick the can down the road again :| 









 Republicans are only supporting Sanders because he is more liberal than Clinton.  




 Them effect veiled gets limited in this ban list or the next lol 




 Anime nostalgia, locals marketing by konami, support for older archetypes, the old viewers of the duel monsters are older with more disposable income, etc  




 Crew concedes a lot of goals, so... :) 














 Dimensions know other methods, but it is less common.  




 Yugo gets jealous at Yuya. - basically

 




 I feel as though Yugo's response would be anger at Yuya for getting an advantage as "King" of the synchro dimension, even though he isn't from there. lol 




 The head of security wants Yugo jealous of Yuya, so there would be a battle between Synchros and Standard. Then, Fusion invades while this happens. 




 The positioning of the cards on the card zones. Where you place the card actually matters! 




 The tariff issue is one area, where you can show the change in the dominant faction of each party throughout our history. I said Democrats tend to be for tariffs because a small faction wants it, but the majority doesn't really, but support other protectionist methods.  




 Republicans used to be pro-tariffs to promote domestic US Manufacturing. Democrats were against tariffs, so they could export farm goods.

Now...

Republicans are against tariffs because it is bad for businesses in a global market place. Democrats tend to be for tariffs to promote US manufacturing.  




 The best candidate will be neither Clinton nor Sanders. Sanders might be too liberal for the general election. Republicans have already launched attack ads on Clinton, even though she isn't the actual official nominee. 




 The "rising living standards" as a result of NAFTA was supposed to reduce illegal immigration from Mexico too ;) 




 Also, don't forget to include the costs of repairing and reinvesting in one industry towns and regions of urban decay like Detroit, Buffalo, Gary, Baltimore, Camden, etc , who are affected by outsourcing.  




 If trade is a two way street, where are the big chinese businesses on American Soil?  




 Countries are inherently protectionist because they will always want...

"we want our country to be the best!" 

"we want to defend our country from foreign influences like culture, immigration, etc"

"we want some of our goods made here!"

etc
 




 Also, Americans are more willing to outsource their industries to other states than to other countries because it is "American". Even then, states still campaign on a protectionist agenda during election times. 

Like "Support this industry because we want to keep _fill in state_ jobs in this state!"  




 I love my representative and my senators but I hate yours. 




 You do realize that both regions share the same currency. Trade in the global scale tends to be determined through the global currency exchange market where the markets determine what currency is worth more or less than the other.  




 Which state? 




 No. Midterm elections are based on states. The last midterm elections was focused mostly on rural states. Democrats lost their chances with North Carolina, Georgia, and Colorado. (maybe LA and Iowa?) Those should have gone Democrat, if they campaigned well enough in the major cities. Cities tend to vote Democratic. Even then, those states are "purple" on the national level.  




 Nope. The House is gerrymandered from the 2010 elections. Democrats need to make sure that they don't lose the 2020 elections to reform the districts. History says the two major parties don't win more than 3 elections in a row usually.  




 We don't have a multiparty system, so it is based on some states. Also states tend to vote in the same way as they do in general elections. 

Red States = Vote Red for Senators
Blue States = Vote Blue for Senators

The majority knows that they will have them for 6 years.  




 Voters are shifting to the "unaffiliated" or Independent group.  




 If you really think Raigeki and HFP should be in the same format, i don't know what to say lol 




 Heavy Storm will come first because HFD is too op.  




 Gerrad will be high priced since Keane and Zardes will likely score goals from his passes 




 Super Vehicroid Stealth Union  




 July 4th since people usually think Baseball = America  




 I rather have seasonal games for those "holiday" games. I think Labor Day makes the most sense because it does take a team of players to score goals.  




 Labor Day? It will be a good holiday just to focus on all things soccer. July 4th already has competition with baseball. MLS will celebrate it as usual. Also, the holiday is during the fall, which coincides with fall sports season for many communities, schools, institutions, etc.  




 I think slowly transitioning is better to allow adjustments.  




 Ethan Finlay 




 It is interesting how when gas prices are too low, Oil companies say that they must close down some production because prices are too low and they can't gain profit as much.  




 Reducing the gas tax will not increase more driver traveling on gallons of gas on the road  




 Testing diff formation against a team that isn't doing too well ish? 




 What happened to the sane Rockefeller, Liberal, Progressive Republicans? 




 Easy way to defund highways. REPEAL THE FEDERAL GAS TAX, so the Highway Trust Fund has no revenues from the gas tax, so now you need to find an alternative revenue plan.

^

Terrible Idea. Just saying. We should increase the federal gas tax by 5 to 10 cents.  




 Clinton only needs to worry about the moderates dividing up her primary votes. (Webb, Chafee, and maybe Biden). She also needs more progressives in the race to divide up the progressive vote from Sanders. The best outcome for Democrats is to find a candidate neither Clinton nor Sanders, so Republicans need to think of a new strategy in the general election, but not too leftwing for Republicans to play "moderate". Of course, Clinton is still a viable candidate. Don't get me wrong.  




 Dang it! I transferred him out for villafina  




 They are running attack ads on Clinton now so they will do damage on her in the general. In the general, Republicans will do the socialist fear-mongering on Sanders.  




 Haha. Don't believe them. Republicans want Bernie Sanders to be he nominee just like how Democrats want Ted Cruz or Donald Trump to be the nominee. 




 Weakness - too many resources wasted on just some synchros. And can't respond to many opponent's spell/trap/walls. Needs more consistency for it to be OP.  




 I wonder if there is a card which does this...... - Neither Player can Normal Summon Monsters.  




 Chainable to the 3 MSTs that people main to combat floodgates.  




 Maybe. if you could transfer out Toia for somebody else,  i think it will be pretty solid.  




 You could wait until the ban list is released, if you are taking a gamble on whether prices will continue to drop. Prices tend to drop over summer and pick back up again in the fall because people want to get rid of decks after national/regional events are over. 

The question is do you need value it more in July/August or you can wait until the fall for Satellarknights.  




 Buy the Box because Secerts of Eternity Sets haven't been selling as much as other sets in stores. It takes time for the market to correct itself, when they realize that Infernoids from the set are good in yugioh. In my locals recently, I overheard management saying that secerts of eternity still has so many packs left that the yugioh community hasn't gotten rid of.  




 I am not sure, if you can tell, who actually needs it the most economically, since anybody can respond saying that they need it and write up life experiences. Either way, it is your call on the pick. haha

I could talk my about my interest for it and write an essay long reasons of why I would deserve it for reasons a,b,c,d, etc. But I want to say that I am a normal yugioh player. I do have cards, of course who wouldn't with all those commons/rares/and the occasional super from the packs. I have a roid deck from when I was younger, cyber, and batteryman deck, so it is not really "meta" per say nor beginner "starter" deck. This is my first 6 ish months of attending locals and I would say that it is a great way to meet new people, have a good time, trade with others, and duel others for enjoyment. It is a great experience, since I couldn't really play casually yugioh with old long time friends, who got away from yugioh with their own niche/interests, etc.

Anyways, you are a great person, who is willing to help other members of the yugioh community. Thanks for your support! (Flattering the person lol) 

 




 High-Density doesn't really occur until you have the population density and budget to maintain it. Business Growth will reach max demand when you have over 100k people with a good mayor rating with many services and high traffic congestion. The biggest problem is high commute time and lack of jobs when you are in high density mode. It becomes a problem because people abandon your city and causes a recession. Your industrial areas need to be in manufacturing + hightech mode as well. 




 I know this is out of the blue, but I think Boston should try to annex Brookline, Cambridge, and Somerville to make a semi circle. 




 summon in faceup defense lol 




 Toons  




 I have a feeling that Konami might make an extra extra deck, where you can play this type of card at any point in the duel, once per a turn.
