But he had a bunch of unabashedly racist comments in other subs so I dished out a little mod abuse.

Edit: was pure troll, actually 




 No. No it is not.  




 What, no xpost to /r/sloths? 

You're slippin' Gboob! 




 Really? You don't think vaccine deniers should be dismissed? Flat earthers should be given just as much credence as rounders? Phrenologists and psychologists put on equal footing? 

Scientific debates don't care about your feelings and if you're offended. It cares about evidence. And those who refuse to examine it, and deny the reality of scientific evidence are in denial. Coddling them just devalues the meaning of "skepticism."  




 Banned for being a racist idiot who doesn't realize what sub he's in.  




 And? 

Had they happened in a warmer world, they would have been even worse. The point is that climate change amplifies the impacts, and without it Sandy wouldn't have been as damaging. 

It's pretty simple logic. Just because something happened naturally in the past doesn't mean man can't influence how it happens in the present. 

There were forest fires before humans existed. Does that mean humans can't start forest fires?

If I turn the temperature of my freezer up .55 degrees is my ice cream going to melt?

And if you turn it up .55F again tomorrow? And the next day? And then turn it up .65F the day after? And then .75f? 

Because this warming hasn't ended. And with the CO2 we've already released, won't end for thousands of years. 
 




 BTW: [Found the paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JD016187/full) showing this is a false assertion, and [another debunking of this stupid meme](http://www.factcheck.org/2015/02/nothing-false-about-temperature-data/).  




 Maybe it's because the only ones you're aware of are the ones the deniers crow about. Because in reality the adjustments go both ways.

 We're edging closer and closer to that 2C guardrail.  




 Well there is ice on the poles, so technically yes we're in an ice age. 

But the natural warming that would be taking us out of it takes hundreds of thousands of years to acheive the temperature changes we're experiencing in just decades. So no, it's not natural.  




 Uh, yeah, if you're going to accuse NOAA, NASA, et al of being so bad at science that their corrections to the record are actually not correct at all, nothing I can say will change your mind. 

The fact is in the past things were measured differently (i.e. using buckets scooped from boats vs engine intake suction, or the biggest difference was when in the day measurements were taken. Morning and afternoon temperatures are pretty different, after all, and correcting for that takes no small amount of time or effort.) 

Updating and correcting for those errors is an ongoing process. Science is iterative, not conclusive, after all.  




 For one thing, rising sea levels set the stage for a more damaging storm surge, as Hurricane Sandy broke records with a 13.2-foot (4 meters) storm surge in New York City's Battery Park, said Pennsylvania State University climatologist Michael Mann.

"At least 1 foot of those 13.2 feet was arguably due to sea-level rise," he said. That's because sea levels are 1 foot (30 centimeters) higher than they were a century ago, he continued.

 Probably much too small scale, though that trash island is huge... 




 [No, no it's not.](http://i.imgur.com/Zip5bLN.png)  




 ...They do it to be as accurate as possible. 

And if you stop being accurate for fear of upsetting deniers, you've failed at science for a particularly poor reason. 

The thing about deniers is nothing real scientists do will have any effect on their beliefs. That's why they're called deniers. They've concocted this whole conspiracy theory about how scientists are all evil marxists out to destroy the economy, and anything scientists do is evidence of that sinister plot.  




 See: Superstorm Sandy 




 I didn't say anyone was, just that it's a denier talking point. 

And I use the term because they're different from actual skeptics, [who have made an explicit ask that we stop conflating the two groups](http://www.csicop.org/news/show/deniers_are_not_skeptics).  




 Yeah, there was a study at somepoint that looked at the full record and found just as many downward as upward adjustments, debunking that particular denier talking point. I can't find it now, but here's the next best thing, a researcher who looked into the adjustments (with some Koch funding) and found them to be legit. Even more, without the adjustments, the record would show even MORE warming than with the corrections! http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/04/prof-richard-muller-not-adjusting-global-temperature-records-would-be-poor-science/

What an understatement!  




 Well it's got 50 upvotes in 2 hours, so I think it's probably a fine title.  




 Maybe try actually reading the piece? The second 2/3rds of the story don't even mention climate change. 

And sorry, but acknowledging the science on climate change isn't a political agenda.  














 The published title and a subtitle from the first line of the article... 




 How science is handled by politicians isn't relevant to (everything)science? 

And how does it have an agenda? It's just asking experts whether and what kind of science questions should be part of the presidential campaign. 

I'm at a loss as to what your problem with this is.  
































































 Adorable. Looks like an 80's sitcom granny. 




 See /r/shittyanimalfacts for further verification.  




 One of my favorite pics, for sure. Glad the title works with it! 




 The US is one of (and a leader of) the Arctic Nations involved. Figured since the US was involved it was US politics.

 My bad, I saw the link to the journal and thought it was to the study, not just the issue. Thanks!  




 Got to hand it to them, it's a clever plan. Say the government's ineffective, then sabotage it at every turn to ensure it's ineffective.  




 No, it simply said that the EPA should've considered costs when it was determining *whether or not* to regulate mercury emissions from power plants, as opposed to considering costs when it determined *how strictly* to regulate mercury emissions.  




 Don't tell Common Core that, because they used climate change as a basis for science from elementary through high school curriculum. 

But I'm sure you know better than actual teachers.

 Scrooge McDuck style gold coin pool? I'm jelly!  




 lol, if they're worried about me wasting my time they'd probably get rid of the dart board first.  




 I'm confused as to why you think comments determine activity for subs beyond /r/askreddit and other specifically-discussion-based subs. 

9/10 of all posts get zero comments. That was my point when I directed you to /all/new. Most posts die in the new queue, it's a fact of reddit, and part of the upvote-merit system. Judging subs by that is simply ignorant of how reddit works. 

And the nerve you hit is the one concerning false claims with absolutely zero evidence.  




 I have reddit open while I work, and the moderator toolbox notifies me of comments instantly. Doesn't take much time or effort to respond when I'm not in a meeting or crunching on something. 

(And as someone who grew up doing schoolwork while chatting on AIM, I'm used to switching between fun talk and serious work.)  




 Comments are an inherently weak metric for activity, because as this demonstrates, a massive number of comments could be generated by just two users (or one talking to themself) and would give the impression of a large amount of activity when in fact there's not. See /r/counting for a prime example of comments not meaning anything substantial. 

Subreddit growth would probably be the best measurement, since that only includes new, active users (whereas subscribers includes some number of now-inactive subscribers). 

So compare: http://redditmetrics.com/r/climateskeptics

to http://redditmetrics.com/r/climate 

Or don't, and stop with the baseless claim that subreddits you don't like are dead. Just because you don't understand and refuse to acknowledge how reddit works doesn't mean you're right to declare subs dead. 

 




 So a subreddit with one post that, over the course of a month, has gotten 4 comments is more active than a subreddit with 100 posts with only an average of 2 comments apiece? 

Yep, sure sounds like an accurate metric to me. Totally not one you've just made up on the spot to make yourself feel better. Totally.  




 Why are you limiting it to subs that discuss climate? And then why aren't you including /r/everythingscience and /r/oceans and /r/collapse and /r/green and /r/ecology? 

Oh right, because you've chosen based on subs you frequent. Which is totally arbitrary and in no way a scientific approach. 

But please, explain how subreddits with more users, more growth, more submissions and more upvotes than this one are dead... 




 You have been banned from /r/shittyanimalfacts. 

Reason for ban: Disparaging the Slowbear.

Length of ban: Forever. 

(not really) 




 Sadly, you probably *can* learn more here than on those cable "science" channels... 




 ...the biggest cherry pick you can think of is using literally ALL of the data? 

Just let that sink in for a second. You just said that using the MOST comprehensive dataset is cherry picking. And using an arbitrarily defined subset is not cherry picked. 

That's some straight up jiggery-pockery applesauce bro.  




 lol, silly me thinking to look at all the data and not cherrypicking things to suit the narrative.  




 [Subreddits where I have over 1k karma](http://i.imgur.com/1WmU6Gy.png) 




 https://www.reddit.com/r/all/new

Lemme know what % of those submissions get attention.  




 Haha yeah, I read the stories in the morning as I'm eating breakfast and taking the train into work, and then spend the 30 seconds it takes submitting the most relevant/important/interesting ones to reddit. Really not a time-intensive process and in return I get to see what smart or funny people have to say about the content.  




 Hahahaha, no, just go through the subreddit and write them down! 

And be sure to post pictures when you go to the zoo!!  




 And? Most submissions across reddit don't get much attention, it's inherent to the front-page-browsing structure. But I don't see how you can think a sub is dead when it has lengthy discussions on a regular basis.  




 Lol I'm salaried and reddit's got nothing to do with it.  









 Well I guess it would if I had some kind of cool pay-per-karma reward structure. 

But I don't, so no, just means fewer orangereds.  









 How do you figure either of those subs are dead? You have to go back all of a day to find [a substantial discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/3d75ko/how_do_you_deal_with_it/) in /r/climate, and [140+ comments in one thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/3d9dj4/startups_have_figured_out_how_to_remove_carbon/) in /r/environment. Hardly "dead"... 









 Um, maybe try reading the story and following the link [to the peer reviewed study](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150714/ncomms8537/full/ncomms8537.html) it's reporting on.  




 No conspiracy theories necessary. Just that others are regularly beating me to the punch in submitting stories, and in /r/science they only allow one submission per study. 

For example, looking now and there's [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3dda40/new_research_says_human_impact_on_the_oceans_is/) story, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3dd5hv/climate_change_is_increasing_stress_on_oceans/) one, and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3dd5ne/the_wildfire_season_globally_has_lengthened_by/) one today, so it's just that other folks are submitting things before I get a chance to. 

 






















































 That was more for everyone else than you, sorry! 

(That or I was being super pedantic.)  




 Came here to say this. 

It's my most upvoted comment, ever. For good reason. 

Also, just for the record, when I made the comment it was italicized like a book title, not quoted like something someone said...
