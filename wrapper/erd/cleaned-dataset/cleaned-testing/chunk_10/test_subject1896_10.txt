 Special tip that I didn't include in this: I did find out from someone that FYI was not a part of my hiring process that the reason I got an interview was largely due to my selection of "open availability" that I marked on my online app. It wasn't true necessarily (I was in school). It's how I got the interview email so quickly I think. 




 Do you guys have any suggestions for where else I could post this, writing or reading wise? Already got it in r/Disneyland. Thank you so much! 




 Thanks for reading!

From another thread:

I turned in this thesis for my creative writing degree in May. More of a Capstone. I had to submit 80 pages of my best work that I'd created during my time at Chapman, which could include new work. This was orignally like 4,000 words of scatterbrain thoughts about working at Disneyland which I ended up inflating to a full-on submission. Didn't have to present it, but the committee read it and sent it back to me with some awesome feedback. 




 I always feel the same way regardless of the story. 




 Thanks for those great compliments.

 Really soon. Will reply with the link here when it's posted. Thanks for reading! 









 Does anyone have an idea where else I could post this on reddit? This is obviously the perfect place, and y'all have helped me gain over 500 reads on Medium (thanks!)  




 It's coming! 




 I lived real close to Disneyland while I was in school. My buddy had quit at the same time as me and we were both interested in doing a show. This is right when the show only had like 10 or less episodes. We reached out a couple times, but never got a solid call back. Oh well! 




 Hi, yes I have. He didn't want me. I think he's missing out. Haven't listened since he didn't hit me back (3 years now?) 




 Parents just don't understand. 




 Maybe with that attitude.  




 That's so awesome. 




 Thank you all so much for the feedback! Part two is written (as stated, it's my thesis so I'm just translating it into episodes). I'll reply to all your comments with the link so you don't miss it! 

-Happy skip 




 Put contact info in your bio (your email, and email that you create, don't matter it's up to you). I bet you'll be approached to sell that, especially if you make it easy with the contact info. I'm not sure for other countries, but as you probably know it's common practice to get paid for good usernames, even tho it's against the TOS. It happens though, and if your name is the name of the show, then I'd hold tight. Maybe try opening a different account for your personal stuff, now. 




 I wish I could go back in time to when I didn't know this existed. 









 Still more effective than Apple Maps 




 This is knocking on the door of the correct answer, but not quite. The boy needs treatment is actually a boy, young like 10 years old. Thank you for your response! 




 This is really, close, but my grandma says it's not the movie. I added more details in my description. Thanks so much for helping! 




 This is a movie I saw with my grandma about 2009-2010 I think, give or take a year or two past. We would really like the information of the doctor in the movie. 

The mother of the boy wrote to the doctor because someone told her his job is to look for cures for illnesses without one. He replied "if you're willing to move here to Oregon with your son, we will try to find a cure." 

He was successful in finding a cure, and at the end it shows the name and address of the doctor in Portland OR.

Is this a correctable issue (by a professional) or is my iMac done? 




 Potentially, but we're talking about this writer's credibility. He's NBC's writer. 




 I live in CA so tip off is at noon. 




 OMG LMAOOOO 




 Need more info. Can't find but one KC suit on their site at that price, and it's big.  




 Glad this got at least 6 upvotes.  




 It's the Spotify Extended Version 














 I worked there 2011-2013. The NYE I worked (I did guest interaction for Main Street fireworks, red vests etc) the doors closed around 6-8. People sitting and staking out spots as soon as the last parade ends. 




 Yes, anytime you send a follow request, they'll be notified in their notifications. Private or public profile.

 I never write for SEO. To begin, start getting to know the social medias better. Explore the different features and pay attention to what kinds of things show up in your feed (type of post, from who, when). Then read up on social media talk from social media marketing blogs. Then (fast forward) start by looking for jobs in "content creation" or "content writing". 




 I do. I write mainly comedic narratives, but also accrued a sizeable following on social media on Twitter and FB. I get paid kind of often for stories in a handful of publications.

However, I don't make any considerable amount of my income from the kinds of writing I enjoy most (including the stuff included above). Instead, I get paid as a writer for companies to do their social media.

It's more than that, because I also consult on soc media marketing strategy and lead campaigns for these companies. But I began as a writer, and any one of you can do it too. It's fulfilling to an extent because it pays me well and lets me write creatively. It flexes my muscles in writing engaging content and in different voices.

I began in college, and could do it because I already had a knack of writing on social media. Majored in creative writing and minored in public relations/advertising, so when I decided to find a job I just put what I could do with social media on my resume. Only one agency hit me back and took a chance on me. Great for both of us. 




 Not true. the part you thread it through doesn't have a direction (the big triangle) 




 Message me before you go on another and I'll remind you.

 




 This is for if you're moving rooms or moving into a new home, or anytime you need to move hella clothes on hangers.

 How about $6.99 for a bag of chicken tenderloins, $3 for two bags of fresh spinach,  $2 for a bag of frozen corn, and a bag of rice for $2? 




 Be a man and tell them you need a different locker. 




 Haha, kind of the opposite. I thought of the title then searched "bed of money."
