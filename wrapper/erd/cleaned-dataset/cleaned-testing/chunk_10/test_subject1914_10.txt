 ahh Okay I think I understand so at the end of the season I'm going to have to big for the player like i would for any other player. if i pay 8-mill and inter pays 10-mill they get him. Is that right ? 




 Hi everyone I've just started a torino save and I'm not used to italian football as i've never done an italian save so could someone simply explain the co-ownership thing to me ? I have a midfielder who's co-owend by torino and inter ? does that mean he spends one season with me and one season with them or ? 




 Yeah I think they have a sugar daddy.  




 You already look a lot better ! keep it up mate we're proud of you. 




 Any of these 'Whats the most underrated films' threads and obviously because of the up vote/downvote system the thread will never show anything underrated unless you maybe sort by controversial but no everybody needs to prove how unique there tastes are but the flip side they don't want to get downvoted so they same the same generic bullshit. 'I'm going to get downvoted but I just don't get the paranormal activity films' yep you're defiantly the only one to think that dickhead. 




 Maybe read the post you're responding too before you respond. Makes you come across stupid 




 Read the post you butthole  




 Didnt you read his comment. Plenty of girls were attracted to him, Plenty of em! and its only a coincidence they all worked in strip-bars  




 Im 22 its been about a month. Pretty much the only reason i commented, In a few months I might stay away from these kinds of threads ! 




 awwwww shit yeah ! 




 Fucking Sassuolo, There the Antony costa of the footballing world 




 I get that but they haven't won the league in near on 5 seasons. the furthest they've got in the champions league is the quarters  




 The narrative of this sub is insanely hard to follow sometimes from months of talking about deadpool like he's the send coming of jesus to now where everyone has read the comics and everyone hates it. Haha I don't understand ! 









 These threads never ever work. 




 Thanks I was trying to go for a cleaner ryan gosling sweep i guess. Thanks for the kind comments  




 Thanks mate, Little insecure can you tell haha! 




 I completely agree honestly it takes Balls to try and tackle the joker after Heath. Very Brave choice ! fair play  




 Yeah I meant it as a good thing for sure ! I'm imaging a total mimic of it and I think it'll be great ! 




 Wow Jared Leto impressed me. Looking forward to his take on the joker. I think it will be a mimic of Heath ledger but I'm still looking forward to it  




 When you wake up and don't get excited about snow  




 hmm Thats very strange. I play on a macbook and haven't face this issue. Have you tried force quitting then loading it back up ?

 Watch out we have a tough guy over here ! 




 He's Like 26/27 and I'm going to make it work by harnessing his world class talent obviously ! 




 I'm sure you're all aware that the biggest travesty in footballing history is the face our lord and savour the danish legend Bendtner hasn't got a world-cup medal. On behalf of everyone I will rectify this.

I'll update you on my progress  




 Yeah you can go fuck yourself you insensitive cunt. 




 I mean its not like i go out of my way to find people that arnet like me ? i don't know how I'm meant to find people like me ? what does that even mean 




 I guess I just never seem to make a meaningful connection with anyone. I have trouble controlling my emotions. and I guess nobody i've met has ever filled that huge gaping hole of insecurity and unhappiness   




 Bottled water. It's fucking water ! 




 I live in a village just outside london,currently unemployed as i've just left uni. I like to read (i love litreture, also I'm a shit speller) Film (I studied film) I love walking m dogs I love football and rugby,

Yes I've thought of going to a meet-up or tried meeting new people  




 been depressed for years and years, back home from uni and living at home where I have no friends no social circle. Attempted sucide over the weekend the lonelyess is going to drive me to death without a doubt  




 Britney spears-everytime. Come at me ! 




 confess my love for various girls in various 'This is romantic as fuck' kind of ways 




 growing up and being a mature adult. Fuck it I like being an overgrown kid 




 fall in love with a girl,fall in love with a flat of my own. forget about the ex that broke my heart. stop trying to commit suicide  




 That's true they would go off the deep end without me 




 get ready for the coldplay/pitbull/u2 karma train 




 i'd go with the french guy if i had to pick between those two. better judgement and better working with youngsters  




 Hey everyone don't have anyone else to tell so fuck it i'll tell you guys. I'm killing myself on monday and you know what ? fuck me i'm looking forward to it. like i said i didnt have anyone else to tell

 Hey guys sorry if this post is no inappropriate but I'm 22 and i live just outside london and at the moment i live with my parents. I start a new job next week and i want to move out a soon as i can but realistically it'll probably be a year or two before i can. any advice on how i could move out sooner ?

He really cut his hand in this scene and just carrys on. That was also his own blood he was rubbing in that actresses face. 




 the scratch card was one pound doubled my money! 




 I know it gets mentioned a lot at the movie subreddit but that scene in django with Leo. I just cant fathom how committed he is to that scene  




 Peep show- I want to be a jeremist  




 one-uppers. I don't care if you once won a car on a scratch card I was pretty excited that I won two pounds ! 




 jeez that looks painful ! 




 forgive me for being ignorant but could you shed some more light on the academic dishonesty part ?

 hmmm i'll think i'll invest in one of them. reckon rust will be okay on wi-fi for now though ? really want to get the game haha 




 thanks for the non-patronising response haha i know a wired would be better but my router is in my living room and it won't reach upstairs in my bedroom :( 




 hi everyone sorry to come over again with a stupid question but i did one of those internet speed test things my upload speed is 4.28mbps and my download speed is 101.55mbps. I don't know much about computers so sorry if this is a stupid question but will my internet be good enough to play rust on ? i'll be playing over wi-fi if that helps.

sorry for the stupid question  




 ohh I have plenty of time. graduate who studied film here, i have plenty of time I'm just worried my internet and computer will be to crummy to cope
 




 erghhh :( 




 Hi everyone thinking of getting rust as it looks hella fun. i thought i'd ask first. i have a macbook and pretty crummy internet would it be a waste of time me getting the game ?

Hey Thanks for the help everyone. I think my specs are good enough, I'm looking forward to playing it :) 




 I'm really lonely I have a tiny social circle and little to no prospects of that changing. which would be okay if i was a lone-wolf type of guy. i feel like i have no real connection or chemistry with anyone. its bad guys real bad 




 Just don't go around spouting about 'well-written' articles when its simply not true. maybe don't talk so much shit you cunt 




 So this is a well-written well-researched article in your opinion ? thats insanely ignorant  




 New to commenting haha 




 No thats the point why are Buzzfeed articles being posted here ?
