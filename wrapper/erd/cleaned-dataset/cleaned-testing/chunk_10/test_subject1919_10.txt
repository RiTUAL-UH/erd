 I watched Clueless for the first time last week and found it very enjoyable. 




 It was released during a period of time when Disney wasn't making critically or commercially successful animated movies. Plus competition from Pixar, which had released Toy Story 2 a year before The Emperor's New Groove. 




 Jamesmobile! 









 The entire movie still amazes me to this day. 




 The visual effects were pretty good too.

 Critically or commercially?

 Thanks. It makes sense now. 




 It seemed like the worst part to me (because I didn't understand the joke). 




 I haven't. Link me. 




 Did anybody understand Liam Neeson's cameo? It wasn't funny and made no sense. 




 No. It is not being shown in cinemas here. 




 This looks magnificent...http://i.imgur.com/AUiIaRi.jpg 




 I hope so. I like him as an actor. He seems to be unlucky with most of the movies he picks. 




 I saw Ant-Man last weekend. Need a new movie for this weekend. 




 Still not sure whether I should see it this weekend. 




 Ryan Reynolds hasn't starred in a successful movie in a long time. I hope that changes with this one. 




 More character posters and a new trailer this week! 




 Sean Connery passed on many iconic roles: Dumbledore, John Hammond, Gandalf... 




 I used to often read them too. So now I'm looking forward to the movie. 




 Have you seen the movie? 




 Isn't he playing a good guy (R. L. Stine) in the movie? 




 Time to celebrate and re-watch my favorite sci-fi trilogy. 




 Very good choice. I hope he accepts the role. 




 I'm hoping they release the first trailer with 'Southpaw' this week. 




 I'm sure according to Hollywood accounting no movie has ever gone into profit, but are there any other well-known examples such as this one?

 Don't forget about all the money Disney/Marvel made by selling toys and other movie-related stuff, selling rights to air the movie on TV, blu-ray/dvd revenue, product placement and partnership with other brands.

 I see. In this case your statement was correct. 




 Marvel released many tv spots, featurettes and clips online. Not to mention a couple of trailers. 




 Doubling the budget means the costs have been recouped. For profits, a movie needs to make more than just double. 




 Guardians of the Galaxy (Aug. 1) had to compete with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Aug. 8): both targeting the same audience. In the end, both performed well though. 









 First trailers tend to be more popular than the following trailers, particularly if the first trailer was a full-length one. We've alreay seen a BvS trailer. The Suicide Squad trailer is the first one. 




 That was a very nice surprise ruined, but there is a lot more Falcon in the movie than I had expected. 




 There was no need to actively seek them. They're all on YouTube on a single channel. In fact I shared a lot of them in this subreddit.

 3 years because Warcraft was at SDCC 2013, 2014 and 2015 and each time they showed some footage. 




 Yes, but they didn't release it online. 




 I know, but they could have released at least a short teaser by now. It doesn't have to be long. A 1-minute teaser trailer would have made me and many other happy. But all I can watch at the moment is the leaked footage, which doesn't look very promising btw. Although I'm sure the full thing in HD will look much better. 




 I meant releasing something online, for the fans that didn't or weren't able to attend Comic-Con. 




 The Warcraft movie has been present at SDCC 3 years in a row. Shouldn't they have released something official (footage) by now!? 




 Typical representative of the 'general audience'. It is mostly the fans who complain about too much footage, as they're the ones following the movie closely. 




 I know. I can only blame myself. I'm seeing the movie tomorrow. Then I'll know for sure whether I should have watched all those videos or not. 




 I suggest watching the 2 trailers one after the other. Then you'll see the difference. I only noticed it after watching both trailers several times. 




 A lot of the tv spots have appeared online. That's how I watched them all. Hard to resist. 




 The shot is not new; it is extended here.

 Did you watch all of them? I watched every single tv spot and all the other footage Marvel released. Some even multiple times. I hope this doesn't ruin the movie watching experience for me. 




 Avengers: Age of Ultron, for example, had 48 tv spots. 




 I just realized that I could have been watching BvS in a cinema right now. 




 At least there's one second of new footage. 




 I fully agree with you. This version feels too rushed and not as epic as the SDCC cut.  I don't think the Suicide Squad will get such a version. It was never meant to debut online, nor will it be shown in cinemas.

 Personally I don't understand what all the fuss is about. Even if I was a pr-guy, I'm not breaking any reddit rules. 




 What is wrong with formality? I prefer my posts to be formal and grammatically correct. I wouldn't call my posts - advertisements. Posters, trailers and movie images are posted here all the time. If I hadn't posted what I posted, someone else would have done so. 




 Just following the rules: "Official movie posters are allowed. Please host them on imgur and link to your source with a comment." 














 Even if I was working for a marketing company (although I'm not), is there something wrong with that? Am I breaking any /r/movies rules by posting posters and trailers (which are allowed btw)?
