 I used to always be one to check a movies rotten tomatoes score, or my favorite critic's reviews before seeing a film, but I've found that when doing so, It can alter my expectations for a film before seeing it. So now I stay away, but I have seen films that I normally wouldn't have watched if not for the positive reception they received. So, what are your views on this subject?  




 Just buy them Magic Mike XXL 




 Solid choice, defiantly either that or The Revenant 




 Just buy them Inside Out 




 what you don't want to watch 19+ hours of Minion fun? 




 If so which movie would you choose? 




 fuck you 




 One thing about this list is movies like The Revenant and Hateful 8 won't be getting a wide release til January 




 True, but you still want him because he's a great actor 




 Man, she can still deep throat a hotdog 




 Would love for Russell to hit the game winner, then watch the announcer eat crow. 




 I'm a fan of "DONT LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS" myself 




 Fair enough  




 Could be about anything from Comic Con really, for me, Henry Cavill doesn't feel enough like Superman for me right now, maybe because I thought Man of Steel was just okay, but I wish he had a stronger presence I guess, anyone agree? 




 Whiplash, almost every scene has me on the edge of my seat will each viewing. 




 Yeah, it felt a litttttttle generic, idk what it is, just something needs to stand out, although I actually think the Joker looks good, IMO I think he'll be the best part and everything else won't be as good 




 The Social Network 




 I think my only problem with the trailer is that Superman didn't talk once (unless he did as Clark Kent in the one scene with Fishburne). After Man of Steel, Superman doesn't feel like that strong of a character, hopefully he can redeem himself in this movie but it may be hard due to all the new characters. 




 He's in MyPlayer mode on 2k 




 That's true  




 That's also true! 




 Is it just me or is his son a bad actor, maybe I just don't like him. 




 From the 1 billion dollars he was given in the end 




 Nope, guy here, true avoiding the face of the guy is a preferred, but if he turns up, I don't want to be looking at a crossover of Mickey Rourke and Sloth from Goonies 




 Who jerks off to porn with ugly guys, even if your a dude, have some standards 




 Ehhh, there was a lot of talk about an RG3 comeback while so many people were talking about the Cowboys defense being awful 




 Congrats on the future first round exit, don't worry your team is far superior to mine at the moment and has actually landed free agents, but still, fuck you and congrats 




 What if god was one of us? 









 To be fair, Clarkson spent all year with Nick and he seems fine 




 Yeah reading this again I have no idea wtf I was thinking..... ehhh fuck it In Mitch We Trust 




 BUT WE HAVE KOBE AND CLARKSON! Guess who hasn't been winning with that backcourt (I know Kobe's been injured), Kobe's got limited time left in the league, and who better to mentor our new young guard. Hopefully we pickup a free agent big to provide a decent season, plus Okafor is basically Brook Lopez without the jumpshot range, good but won't take you to the next level, In Mitch We Trust. 




 i have no idea 




 Now that we have Russell how would you feel about that? 




 Does this mean Free agent big man signing incoming?!?!?!
