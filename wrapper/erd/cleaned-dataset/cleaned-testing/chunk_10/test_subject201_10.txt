 Its ok. I was there and we went through it together.  




 god damit.  




 Somewhere out there is a props guy that could help us answer this question... Maybe he uses reddit. That would be amazing. 




 maybe they just forgot the corner piece? I don't think they would put all that work into something thats on screen for a few seconds when they can just find it at the old props warehouse.  




 maybe the props department were just re-using old stuff. 




 I admire your shamelessness. Keep it up. 









 This is what they're saying... 

Him: Its big

Her: HOW BIG? 

Him: 10 and a half 




 Good, good. Hows Franky fat face? Oh that franky, always grabbing dudes balls. ahh good times. 




 Ron? Is that you? I thought you were in jail. 




 I just upvoted fucking casual.  




 We exist in a small corner of reddit known as /r/nofx . Decided to mossy on over to jokes to post this one. Nice to meet you. 




 I tried to see if I could recognize any buildings but had no luck so they must have filmed that scene in Pennsylania as well. 




 I'm also from Waterville. When I first saw that sign I was excited too. Glad im not the only one haha 









 I pride myself in thinking I know it all when it comes to NOFX and then you show me they have a beer. Had no idea. Thanks for sharing this!  




 Stick control comes with practice. But I used to put some headphones on and play with my favorite songs for hours. I liked to practice with jam bands like Phish cause they change tempo and rhythm and its a lot more fun than just pop songs that's just one beat for the whole song. 




 This is a big one. Usually very true. 




 Thank fuck its outside your window. I would set my house on fire if it was inside. 




 thanks for the heads up! Ill check em out. 




 Haven't tried the IPv4 but I approve of the mutation! 




 I love it man. you wont regret it when you get one. 




 my wife was with me when I was adding it to my juice and shes like "your gonna vape that shit!? Its fucking hand moisturizer!" 




 oh ok. Deff shitty ecr material though.  




 Honest question. What would be wrong with using this? My friend bought some of this and I added some to a 50/50 pg,vg juice and I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. 




 That would look sick as tits, black and white or not. What color is your Sigelei? If its black, black and white is the way to go. But color would look cool to. If you do this I would love to see it! 




 Yea that's much more satisfying.  




 Thank you kind sir. 




 I think I've seen that one. Nice man! 




 what concert? 




 Found the sticker at a record store and cut it myself and it worked out great. I think it was meant for a bumper sticker so its also a high quality sticker. 




 Thanks man! I thought it improved its looks considerably.  














 same thing was said about gay marriage. Could happen. 




 yea that's a good idea. I think schools should at least teach both equally. When I went to school we didn't learn much about the metric system at all except in science class but it was still minimal. 




 This is the best explanation for this problem I have ever seen. So simple yet so dead on. No farther commenting required. 




 Size 14 shoes are the basis of the american measurement system. Right? This must be right. It explain's everything.  




 I have size 14 shoes. How many times do I step? is that 14 inches?!? WHAT DO I DO!? FUCK! 




 Well, Americans aren't really cool with change. People would flip out if our system was changed to metric. 




 yep. 









 I'm surprised it still works, I've played the shit out of it. Only NOFX vinyl I have though.  




 Nice dude! [HERE'S](http://imgur.com/a/dg4CL) mine. I think I got this in 2007. Played the shit out of it. 




 id imagine if you added the oceans it would be round 




 Hell yes! [here's](http://i.imgur.com/VPkVnU7.jpg?1) mine. Best mod ever 




 Any idea what causes this? I have the same thing happen to me sometimes. Someone said to much sugar but thats not that case and I dont really eat much greens. 




 Man, I read that whole thing. What a piece of shit scammer. I dont understand how people fall for this. They prey on the old and retarded I guess. Good job telling them to fuck a goat. love it. 




 we all know hes lookin. unless its his mom in that case your right. 




 Dont look, dont look, dont look... fuck. 




 I came here to point this out as well. Lets just hope its his moms instructor. 




 score. Reddit thinks I did good. 




 IT LOOKS LIKE A NIPPLE!! Did I do good?
