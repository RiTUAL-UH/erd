 Because you are making it all about money. Its not about money. Imagine if spacex and tesla started today instead. How far back everything would have been pushed. How much technology that came out of those companies so far that we would still be half a decade away from. Sure it would be easier to start those companies now but that hardly makes it a mistake what he did. He is pushing technology further than he could have sitting on paypal. And just because he lost out on a couple billion doesnt make it wrong. Its not idolizing to say that space was his passion and that he could have retired 10 years ago because thats the truth. If it was just about money he really could have retired a long time ago. 



















 But they are dexiding on punitive damages this week or next. And that is dependent on your assets. 

Its not just time, its also about paying less. And overall its just a big "fuck you" to rick ross.  




 He declared bankruptcy because he is getting sued over that sextape he leaked.  He has to pay less if he doesnt have any money on paper. He still has a couple stacks of millions laying around.  




 Humans are used to seeing in the visible wavelengths but some animals can see further out wavelengths and some cameras can see even more wavelengths. A wavelength is just a measure of how quickly the light is oscillating. Have you ever seen the purple glow of a remote control on your phone camera? That is because remote controls use infrared light. It oscillates too quickly for humans to see but a camera can pick it up. Well, turns out that all minerals oscillate and release some light at different frequencies. We cant see them in the visible spectrum, but they are visible in infrared. A huge camera that is made specifically to pick up infrared light can look at an asteroid that looks almost black in the visible spectrum and  it will see a glowing colorful ball. 

Scientists on earth can then look and say, "hey remember a couple years ago when bob looked at platinum here on earth under this camera? It gave off the same light,  so im pretty sure that asteroid has to have some platinum on it."

Thats if you cant get to the asteroids. Sometimes scientists send satellites to the asteroid and those have more sophisticated equipment that gets closer. One thing they have is a xray or gamma ray spectrometer.  This is like when you break your bone and doctors can xray you to look "through" your skin. Except its doing with a whole planet. 

Another thing that can be done is throw signals at the asteroids,  like radar, and see what bounces back. You know those super cool spy planes that absorb radar to hide? Well, minerals try to do the same thing but arent all that good at it. They leave a distinct signature and we can compare that to the analysis of minerals on earth. This method is newer though.

 The internet is like roads in your neighborhood. Each website is a house. Anyone can go to any house and knock on the door and ask for some info. But then people learned that they could make a robot that could walk very quickly down the roads and knock on many doors to get info. Places like google can use their robot to find a lot of links and give you info about them when you search. 

But some people dont like robots, so they post a file called robots.txt on the front of their door. Whenever a robot visits a house, he should first read this posting. It is a set of rules that tells the robots how to behave if they enter, and it can even ask them not to enter at all. 

Now, this doesnt force the robots to listen because that would be difficult to impliment. But most well known robots will listen because if not, they can get a lot of negative attention. Kinda like laws. By writting a law and passing it, you arent forcing humans to abide, you are merely stating what is and is not allowed and penalties can come later of the rules are broken. 

If yelp didnt want the google robot to visit their site, knock on their door, stalk their children, etc, all yelp has to do is put up a sign that says "google robot, you are dissallowed here." 




 At the top right you have an option to view sidebar. If you include any wiki links in the sidebar it will open them in the built in browser.  




 So does RiF 




 Also, when an account is shadowbanned their old posts are sent to the spam queue on subs. A mod can re approve all their old content. 




 I like this option. But then what standards do they choose for redacting and how do you made mods conform to those set of rules? 




 What's to stop a mod from using that one option always? If they want to censor sonething they can just say its personal info and it will be cleared.  




 Yes

 I just have no control.  




 I know how you feel. I remember in elementary school kids would always tell that joke that goes like "hey what's your name" and you respond and then they say "spell it" and you spell it and they say "no it is spelled I T" I always thought it was just a stupidnjokenrhatndidnt make sense and that they were calling me an "it" but then I got it one day and that they meant like spell the word "it" and it made sneicnes

Did yoi have a siezudnmssmms? 




 I lost my remote control and so just downloaded the universal remote app on my phone and have been using that for the past week because I'm too lazy to look for the remote. I know this isn't a pun so sorry for derailing this, but your comment reminded me of this predicament I'm in. I bring it up because it is absolutely amazing! At somepoint in the last couple decades, we entered the future! I have no idea when or how it happened, but it blows me away!

 Have I been doing it wrong my whole life?  




 But myths are stories and mythical implies that something isnt real, however great it may be.  I think legendary has a larger connotation than mythical. 




 I have upvoted you for being last.

Edit: omg first selfie 

Edit omg this is my highest rating comment in cj, thanks guys

Edit Omg this blew up

Edit omg my first gold? thank kind stranger, le tips all my fedoras. This is so awesome, I wanna thank the academy for telling me that karmawhoreing was the way to go,  Neil DeGrasse Tyson for dropping science type stuffs on the reddits,  Mr Rogers For telling me how important I am to the lives of those I meet; how important I can be to the people I may never even dream of. And that there is something of myself that I leave at every meeting with another person,

And, course /u/preggit, our god preggers, who drops the dankest memes and mod abuse on us and convinces us to keep going. 

Its moments like this that I feel like my contributions are noticed. Thanks kind internet stranger, I am forever in your debt. 

Live on and prosper. 

Edit lol they just told me my edit was longer than my original post, I guess so.

 Exactly, I don't understand how some people don't see that this is the logical conclusion to pressure for minimum wage increase for many unskilled jobs.  
























 I actually upvoted you. 

I understand you were trying to help and understand that it isn't a physical limitation but rather a lack of practice or knowing what to do.  I know there is something I am missing or just not understanding. 

As /u/sbeiclmc said, 
I know the struggle. I can't stand having people try to "Teach me" how to whistle and then complain that it's "really simple"

That really captures the sentiment I feel and probably the one of those that downvoted you. Thank you for trying to help, but I still don't really get it and maybe I will after some more practice, but today wasn't the day either.  




 I get a small whistle out but it sounds retarded. Like, I kinda see how that would work its just that playing with the different positions doesnt give me anything better.  




 Yea not to jump on a engineering circlejerk, but I did EE and im interning this summer for 28 an hour. I understand that the returns are big, especially for more technical majors like that or doctors or specialized things like law school. I was just saying that I feel like people are beginning to be more ok with not doing it. You still get the older guys that think you are a failure if you dont go to school, though.  




 Yes 




 I do this on 4chan when they started asking for you to fill in captchas as a fuck you to the man. I fill in the first word correctly and then type gibberish in for the second. My answers are usually long sentences or incoherent rambling so there is no chance that another user would enter the same thing and validate that response, but I still get to have fun.

 Or when people reply to your comment and not give a courtesy upvote.  I try to upvote anyone I reply to or replies to me.  




 Can I join too 




 Whistling. I cant whistle for crap and when people try to show me they are like : "just do this" then they pucker their lips and whistle. Like, um no its not working. Then they are like: "you have to do your tongue like this" ok so I do my tongue oike this and that and this and that and nothing. 

Then they are like "just practice man" bro what is there to practice, I cant do anything.

 For using his navy seals training for something other than good.  




 As you scale up you start requiring a lot lot more material. A sphere's volume is 4/3pi*r^3 so if you double the radius you need 8 times as much material. 

They have these: http://www.esolar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wiggle-1024x701.jpg

In a bunch of deserts that use the idea of focusing light, but use mirrors instead. If you double the amount of mirrors you double the reflective space you have and double the material required. 

The sphere is a neat idea and the model is a great proof of concept, but theres a reason that it was implemented with mirrors on a large scale first and not with sphere's.

 Yea, I only have like three serious alts. The rest are just for lurking and stuff. Reddit doesnt control me 




 Just all the edgy or weird things I tried to do. I misunderstood a lot but would still try to have conversations with people about my limited understanding and adults always thought I was an idiot. 

Like my sister told me that beer was urine bottled up and men drank it. So I believed her, because why would siblings lie? So one day at a park or something I asked a complete stranger why he was drinking urine and tried to have a conversation with him about how gross that was. He shooed me away and looked at me like an idiot, of course. 

Or one day at a store I went up to a random dude and said in the loudest most obnoxious 10 year old voice "what is up doooog" cuz thats cool right? But I didnt say "sup dawg" like the cool kids at school, I said " what **is** up" and then said a long, drawn out, obnoxious "dooooog." My mom said sorry to that old man, sighed, and dragged me away. 

Or the time I said, hey I am a strong independent child and can put my own seatbelt on. So I unhooked my seatbelt, got out the car and decided that I would get in on my own and put my own seatbelt on. But my mom didnt know I was outside of the car until she hear my screams from under it as she started pulling off. And then some CPS person talked to us and asked if I was being abused and I probably almost got taken away. 

Or what about the time my uncle was getting married in Honduras so we all flew over and I was staying with some relatives. My mom got up early to go decorate the church. But I wanted to go with her so later that morning I got up and decided to walk about 2 hours through some of the worst part of town to get to the church but of course I got lost cuz I was fucking 8 years old. My cousin found me and drove me to the church and gave me a talk about the gangs and crime and how they kidnap kids that wander alone through bad parts of town. 

I was a dumb kid.

 You 




 The idea that college is necessary.  It feels like 10 years ago everyone had to go and if you didnt you were a loser. Now it feels like, as more people realize it is no longer easy to support yourself with a part time job and go to school, it is become more okay to work for a couple years after highschool or do something else instead of immediately going to college.  




 Hey bby 




 What the fuck did you just fucking say about Reddit, you little bitch? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Karma Whores academy, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on SRS, and I have over 300 confirmed golds. I am trained in League of Legends  and Im the top upvoter in the entire /r/funny forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this sub, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the 4chans and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your profile. Youre fucking banned, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred subreddits, and thats just with my main account. Not only am I extensively trained in vote manipulation, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the /r/conspiracy arsenal and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the internet, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, kiddo. 




 Unidan said it before getting banned.  




 Yea I remember seeing it on 4chan too and just skipping over it. The next day I saw the /r/4chan post and the links to all the news articles and it blew my mind. I remember him talking about how the kid would find her soon and thinking how fucked up that kid must be.  




 No, it actually gets more and more impractical as you get larger. 
 




 Doxep is people too 




 But no one gave cake away to him. Or me :( 









 Well, I guess you have a point.  




 If you compare the best from today to the best from a couple decades ago, today people are smarter, wittier, healthier. Like I said before, the issue is that everyone compares our average joe to the best that they remember from back in the day. 

We get the benefit that history filtered out the good ones and thats all we see. 

Take a current example, the new queue vs the front page. The front page has already been filtered for you, so if you passively enjoy reddit by chilling on the front page your perception of the quality is slightly higher. When I started going to the new queue and voting and interacting with recent posts, I realized 99% of what gets submitted is shit.

When you look back in history and "remember" the witty guys, what you actually are remembering is their hot page. And im not saying they werent smart, they had plenty of intelligent people, but our perception is still skewed against our current time. We are stuck in the new queue of today and when a song comes out or we see a new comedian try, we see all the failures with the additional occasional gem, and that skews our perception.  




 The reasonable solution 




 Nice 




 No, it has to be the gay thing 




 But, plz 




 Stop with the nostalgia bullshit. People are probably more clever nowadays. You just only remember the handful of smart, witty, clever people from 30 years ago but get bombarded with imbeciles on facebook daily.
