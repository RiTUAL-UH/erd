 I definitely feel like this book is marmite, people either love it or despise it :/ 




 So I saw this book recommended on Reddit countless times and decided to read it. I'm 124 pages in and I have to say I'm not really enjoying it. I feel like the main character is really self absorbed and annoying and I find that I don't actually like him. 

The problem is, I've only really started properly reading recently and I have terrible OCD with finishing books. I'd feel dirty if I was to put it down without finishing it, especially considering it gets such high praise. Maybe I just need to be more open minded about it? But then  again what's the point of reading if your not gonna enjoy the book. Does anyone know if this book picks up or gets better or should I just move on?

Thanks! :) 




 I suffer from terrible health anxiety also so I can relate. It's extremely tough being optimistic with obsessive negative thoughts related to hypochondria but I guess thats the challenge ahead of you. You will be fine though. In an anxiety book I read, the author stated that the two classic characteristics of an anxious person is that they expect the worse and they under-estimate their coping abilities. You will be fine regardless of the outcome, trust in your ability to deal with shit. Anticipation is the worst thing.

 Also, I once read a quote that I really wish I could find now that went like "how empowering it is for your deepest fear to become a reality, only to discover you are still okay" As a fellow hypochondriac, I really hope the best for you but always remember, even if it does happen, who cares. It won't define you, it's better not to worry and then get something than to worry your entire life over what ifs. When I was worrying about mine, I almost didn't care if the diagnosis was that I had cancer because I was so sick of worrying and being in the weird limbo stage. :) 




 Dude. I've had big lymph nodes in my neck for over 3 years. I'm also a hypochondriac and I'm pretty sure they originated in me constantly fiddling and worrying about it. I got scans and everything and it was nothing. You have no idea how powerful the mind is. Especially when you are a hypochondriac. Every time I worry about a disease I will look up the symptoms and then proceed to get every single one. And I'm not even kidding. I've had every symptom of every serious disease. My neck is riddled with lumps, I've had them all scanned and I'm fine. I appreciate the sentiment of your post and i think you are right, but I absolutely would not give up and assume you have cancer because you still probably don't if what happened to me is anything to go by.  




 Yeah I think he's part of a party who were following the boy and his dad throughout the book.  




 Make her lucky to know you 




 Think for yourself dawg!  




 Didn't the guy who shot at them with a bow and arrow take a flare to the face? Yeah I like that quote too.  




 The actual copy doesn't have quotation marks either. It's something I had to get used to and sometimes I found I got the characters speaking mixed up. If you can get passed that I recommend giving it another shot! 




 I can imagine. I'm young myself so I guess there's a whole new dimension to the book once you have kids. My only regret whilst reading it was that I didn't do it like you did and read it in much fewer sittings to get the full brunt of the bleakness in one go.  




 Thanks for the suggestion! I mean to. In most threads related to The Road I see people recommend Blood Meridian and No Country for Old Men so I want to read both of them. Although I might have a break and read something happy before delving into Blood Meridian.  




 Spoilers below.

So I just finished Cormac McCarthy's "The Road" and overall I'd have to say that I really enjoyed the book. I'd already seen the film which I absolutely loved but I don't think that took much if anything away from the book and I love both formats of the story. 

Some of my favorite quotes: 

"Go to sleep.
I wish I was with my mom.
He didn't answer. He sat beside the small figure wrapped in the quilts and blankets. After a while he said:
You mean you wish that you were dead.
Yes."

"We used to talk about death, she said. We don't anymore, why is that?
I don't know. 
It's because it's here. There's nothing left to talk about.
I wouldn't leave you.
I don't care, it's meaningless. You can think of me as a faithless slut if you like. I've taken a new lover. He can give me what you cannot. 
Death is not a lover.
Oh yes he is."

"Rich dreams now which he was loathe to wake from. Things no longer known in the world. The cold drove him forth to mend the fire. Memory of her crossing the lawn toward the house in the early morning in a thin rose gown that clung to her breasts. He thought each memory recalled must do some violence to its origins. As in a party game. Say the word and pass it on. So be sparing. What you alter in the remembering has yet a reality, known or not."

"In the yard was an old iron harrow propped up on piers of stacked brick and someone had wedged between the rails of it a forty gallon cast-iron cauldron of the kind used for rendering hogs. Underneath were the ashes of a fire and blackened billets of wood. Off to one side a small wagon with rubber tires. All these things he saw and did not see."

There are loads of more bits I love but I don't want to write all of them out :)

So I know some people complain about McCarthy's writing style and at the beginning of the book I felt inclined to agree. I found that the pacing and short paragraphs made it really hard to actually gain some momentum to read. So it took me a few days to get into it as I was only reading ten or so pages at a time at the beginning. But once I got more hooked into the characters and imagery it became a lot easier and I ended up really appreciating the short snippet paragraphs that the book is written in. I feel like it suits the style of the book. These characters are lost and confused living in a chaotic world therefore the writing style is similar, each paragraph isolated and separated from the rest with little continuity. I don't know if all of McCarthy's books are written this way but I felt for this book it really worked.  

I loved the way in which dialogue was written. The short phrases and sentences between the boy and the man. Although they are not actually saying a lot. It feels that each segment of dialogue is brimming with meaning. I also found the dialogue quite refreshing because I'm quite bad at understanding or painting an image when reading descriptions which there is a lot of in this book. 

I liked how short the book was. It felt concise and not needlessly long. Having just read the uncut version of "The Stand" it was nice reading a book that was way shorter but still as good none the less. Makes me realize that length isn't everything in books. 

Lastly, I loved the dark themes of the book. McCarthy doesn't really hold back on anything. He's a master at making you feel utter despair and hopelessness with the suicides, cannibalism and general shenanigans going on in post apocalyptic america. 

Anyways, I'd love to discuss more so if anyone has any opinions about what I've said or what they felt after reading the book please comment :)


 




 Are you exercising? Because Exercise regulates adrenaline and helps keep it consistently lower. If you find time in the day, go for a run or do anything for 20 mins. Then afterwards have a cold shower. Guarantee you'll feel better afterwards.  




 I'm sorry to hear that :( Must suck when you don't like a doctor or you get nervous around them.  




 That's actually a good idea. I feel like I can't just say everything as soon as they ask. Would need a few days to actually think and remember how I've felt and make a list so I don't miss anything out. I want the diagnosis to be as close as possible. Thanks for the advice :)
