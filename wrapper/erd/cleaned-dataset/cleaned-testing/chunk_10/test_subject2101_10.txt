 Dude...  You took this pic on the overhang that there is an old-time picture of two ladies dancing on top of?  Thats a fucking crazy spot. 




 hey, remember that thing I did a while ago?  Well, I want some more free shit and attention!!

 Simple solution: Stop using facebook.

 Um, no.

 Catholicism and its adjectival form Catholic are used as broad terms for describing specific traditions in the Christian churches in theology, doctrine, liturgy, ethics, and spirituality.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism

The major difference about Catholics from other Christians (disclaimer: I am a baptised Catholic, but not a trained or practicing one), is that they believe the Pope (you the one, ~~Dr. EverythingBeAllright~~ the guy with the tall hat ^^^^^St ^^^^^Peter ^^^^^was ^^^^^a ^^^^^rabbit that lives in the Vatican) speaks the word of God (or something similar), and therefore holds sway over the Catholic Church and its believers world-wide.

The reason people freaked out a bit about JFK being a Catholic, is that they thought that would mean that Rome could secretly control or otherwise influence JFK if he was elected.  A somewhat realistic fear based on hi~~s~~story]. 




 Because there is more than one type/side of Christianity.

 Settle down, Louis.  We've heard your standup before. 




 LOL, I would love to see [Snoop's](/user/here_comes_the_king) reaction to this. 




 Starring *Tracy Handfuss* of all people... 




 Totally.

As an IT guy and wire-runner in another life, I always recommend to go through a place and check all the telco outlets.  Open them, and clean them.  Yep, clean the contacts.  Old wiring will accumulate dust even in between the contacts that are screwed-down.  Unscrew 'em, clean or cut the wire, and re-attach.

For myself, I will go through a premise and re-punch/attach/whatever all the wiring that all my future communications depend on.

 Not a streetfight.  This is assault. 




 You gotta appreciate the lightning that comes with these super brief storms though.

 I really-really hate make age/grow-up cracks.  I much prefer to give people the benefit of the doubt, but your comments are ridiculous.

Please take this to heart when you have conversations in public. 




 RemindMe! in 3 years 




 Its not just you.  They linked to the wrong size image. 




 I didn't say you comment wasn't in historical context.  I said you don't know what the fuck you are talking about.

My guess is that you are a teenager from New Zealand, and you need to grow up.  Either way, you need to grow up.  When you do, please come back and revisit this conversation in a polite and contributing manner.  I'd love to have a rational discussion with you.  Until then, kindly *fuck off*. 




 This.  I have discovered so many good songs/artists because of these unique Pandora features. 

Slacker at one point took my preference, and I paid for it as well (even bought a hat to help support them), but they destroyed themselves imho, and I went back to Pandora. 




 This site gives you a decent baseline config, but is by no means a calibration - and likely has you turn off a lot of the advanced features of your TV that control picture clarity. 




 I'm replying based off of your fragmented storyline.  If I have misconstrued something, its because I started at the beginning of your story - not at the end.  Im not trolling.  I'm reading.

I have quoted your statements multiple times, and you did not specifically refute any of the quotes - so I continued with the assumption that there was nothing to correct.

Regardless of any of that, you still stole the phone if you did not get permission from either the giving or receiving party.  You took it opportunistically - i.e.,  you stole it. 




 I'd love to see you present your side of this argument to /r/logic. 




 We are talking historic context, and what bad can come of it.  You have absolutely no fucking idea what you are talking about.

Go lodge your complaint to /r/Im14andthisisWTF. 




 Try a close-match x6500 series monitor. 




 And here we go:  back to the classic defense of the sub, the hippie/communist defense.

Theft is theft, regardless of your socioeconomic agenda. 




  I don't work for the company that this phone was supposed to go to.

You work for the company that was handling what you stole from.  The final destination company has nothing to do with it. 




 Nothing empirical.  Only concerns regarding family ties and/or loyalties to the emperor.

AFAIK from what I learned at Manzanar, there were no discovered cases of Japanese-American disloyalty of any of the people interned or otherwise having served in the US armed forces during that time.

The problem is always with "concern" though, and the fear mongering that goes with it.  This was also on the heels of a lot of *"they took our jobs"* backlashing against Japanese immigrants.  




 If I may add a point, not doing well at something is not a sufficient reason to be racist.  Particularly not a reason to round up an entire race of people, force them to lose all of their possessions (only allowed to take a suitcase), take them out to the middle of nowhere (hundreds of miles from where they lived) and make them build their own "housing", keep them within a fortified encampment with guard towers, force them to sign documents with unclear ambiguous statements, ...   you know what - I'm just gonna stop here.

Manzanar was disturbingly close to a Nazi concentration camp.  I realize that a nazi comparison is strong, but in terms of US history, its true.  Hindsight always shows you at your worst, but its not an excuse for a "but" statement.  What we did was wrong.  There are not "but"s to excuse this.

 If you find theft ethical, you have a moral compass that requires adjusting.  That is my constructed distinction. 




 You are obviously not Italian.  I would love to see my Sicilian grandmothers reaction if you said this to her. 




 Cool.  I'm confident you are all kidding yourselves, and are engaging in theft - not dumpster diving. 




 Exactly.  You are being selective about what you consider ethical.  So, whatever.  You want to do what you want, and take a blind eye to what you do not.

Which, coincidentally, is also unethical.  




 TIL why I call slow drivers fucking retards.  




 The U.S. Government was extremely concerned about this, and is an underlying reason for the internment camps themselves - never mind the related regiments. 

Source: I have been to the Manzanar internment camp historic site and museum. 

If you ever wants be truly disgusted with racism and your own government...  Make the trip and visit this site.  There are so many powerful stories you have never heard about.

i.e. no matter what we try to do, we are all fucked in the end. 




 My definition of ethics comes from the actual definition of ethics.  You however, are choosing to ignore to apply said definition because of a situation that you do not agree with.

You continue to turn this discussion into something it is not. 




 Oh, you got permission to take it then?  Because:

 So, the deal is, I work at a facility with 50-200 people in it. We have these battery / old phone recycle boxes. Someone put their iPhone 5c in it. I took it home and charged it and it was already wiped of data. I rewiped it and am now using it. 




 If they don't bring in the torch while riding this, I will be sorely disappointed! 




 OMG, is this the little girl from Dune? 




  Mdchen

Isnt it closer to "maiden"?  Which could have several implications to meaning. 




 1. **OP stole from his employer**. Talk your way out of that ethically.  I fucking dare you to.
2. **OP intercepted property that was exchanged in a business transaction**.  The original owner made a choice of what to do with their property, and who to give it to.  It wasn't discarded as "trash".  It was recycled for a fee and with an intent.  You dont get free dibs on items that are still going through a business cycle.  OP is interfering with the recycling process for personal gain, instead of letting the related businesses thrive from the business.

This isnt dumpster diving.  This is stealing. 




 holy shit.  thank you for the update! 




 You are justifying based on your own selfish desires. You are avoiding the violation of two ethical situations posed by OP. 

The question is of ethics. Turn it into something else if you want, but it doesn't answer OPs question fairly.  




 I wouldn't steal from the company I work for.  




 The CalFire rep said it wasn't affecting their efforts.  I couldn't really speak to any other possible details.

I realize some outlets are reporting it as a problem, but I havent seen anything from CalFire directly that confirms - only what the rep said yesterday that denies that they suspended any activity. 




 Interesting.  FWIW the ABC7 interview with CalFire was while the DC-3 was dropping retardant.  They specifically asked about the drone problem report, and the rep said it wasn't effecting their efforts.  \*shrug\*

edit: after watching that report you linked, I am not taking away the same conclusion that you are - that they are saying otherwise.  KLTA is sensationalizing the bit, and nothing directly from CalFire is saying that their efforts were actually interrupted. 




 Cal fire was interviewed yesterday afternoon about this by abc7, and said that they did not halt any aircraft assisting the cajon pass fire. 

Although typically standard procedure to do so - they did not in this situation.  




 I thought it was that they never swear.  




 No they didnt.  I live in LA, and watched the entire event live.  ABC7 interviewed a CalFire rep about this (the drone), and the rep said that they did not ground any aircraft - although it is typically procedure to.

In this situation, they did not ground or otherwise prevent and helicopters or other aircraft into the airspace to assist in putting out the fire.

I'm not saying its not a serious issue, etc, etc.  But its untrue that any aircraft were grounded or deterred because of the Cajon Pass fire on Friday afternoon. 




 It's not a quote. Just a good allusion.  




 You are imposing your own sense of justice upon someone else - against their knowledge and/or wishes.   That is unethical. 

There are ways you could accomplish your desires ethically, but OP is choosing not to do so. Instead OP is performing a selfish act out of moral righteousness. 

I've been dumpster diving for 25 years.  




 I'm sure he feels tip-top, Tommy. 




 According to an interview on ABC7 with a fire dept rep, nothing was grounded in this instance.  no planes or helicopters were deterred in this particular situation - although it typically is policy to do so. 




 What you have done is unethical.

1. The previous owner left it with a specific company for a specific intent.  You are violating the wishes of that person.
1. You stole from the company your work for.

edit: ...apparently there are people that dont understand what *ethical* actually means. 




 Best of luck, everyone! 

 It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor.  Seneca 




 Debauchery, uh...  finds a way! 




 Its not a matter of radar, as we arent talking military drones - we are talking about little RC quad-copter type drones.

When firefighters spot them, they give a deter(dunno the actual term) order to inbound helicopters to avoid collision. 




 @ 7:30 P - still avoid the area at all costs:

* 15 Fwy is still closed between Hwy 138 and Oak Hills exit
* 3000+ acres burnt
* mandatory evacuations in the area and direction of fire spread (heading NE last I heard)
* serious smoke/respiratory concerns for those upwind (heading NE last I heard)
* evacuated passengers from hwy taken to area HS to wait to return to cars
* some abandoned (primarily damaged AFAIK) cars are being towed from hwy
* some people have been escorted back to their vehicles
* 20 vehicles destroyed, 8-12 damaged
* Fire trucks on-scene. Helicopters and airplanes performing water and retardant drops.  Airdrops will be halted at sunset (this is safety policy) 

----

@ 4:15 P - (reported) avoid this area at all costs:

* 15 Fwy is closed between Hwy 138 and Oak Hills exit
* 500+ acres burnt
* 10+ cars have caught fire. Fire trucks cannot reach these vehicles. Some firefighters on scene using portable extinguishers 




 Fascinating.  Posted by "/u/screenwriterjohn", but, if I have seen this same car around town at wrap-parties...  I think this car is driven by a tv show writer. 




 I would hit it with the might of a thousand banhammers!

 I think the concept is that bone marrow contains hematopoietic stem cells.

 I saw him/her as argumentative, because they didn't agree.  Being argumentative in a discussion that clearly lacks understanding isn't a bad thing, nor does it deserves punishment.

So many of us type as if we are talking verbosely, but then others react negatively with excuses of grammar, diction, and phrasing.

Are we the internet of common-folk, or are we Downton fucking Abby? 




 Guys, dont downvote a question.  If they are wrong, explain why or upvote the existing response that does.

Being wrong on the Internet shouldn't be penalized if it further expands the conversion and leads to a greater understanding. 




 I'm in IT, and I cant tell you how many people I have met over the years that have made this same mistake.  b vs. B is something I wish the industry would stop doing.  It confuses the hell out of consumers.

 A brigade is a division of an army.  When used as a verb, it means to get a group together to attack something else.

Brigading on Reddit is the observance of a group of people (usually subscribers of a particular subreddit) attacking another subreddit.  Brigading will usually be cited if it can be shown that this was organized and/or instigated from subreddit postings and links.
