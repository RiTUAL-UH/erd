 Thanks, this was really helpful! I'm not sure if any ovens go up to 700, that was just a hypothetical :p 









 "Reeeeeeeeee" 




 Just communism doing what it does best. Ignoring people' opinions and enforcing idiotic rules and censorship. 




 Glorioush  




 You can just feel her desperately trying to lie to herself about what her dad thinks about her sexuality. 




 I think that one thing about CK2+ is that genetic traits are more likely to be passed on, so it probably has something to do with that. 




 I have heard black people called oreos by other black people though. Apparently it means someone who's black but acts white. 




 I love this sub. 




 Could another nation have explored it all and  the shared discorvery thing just kicked in? 




 It seems as though whenever there is a monotheistic religion introduced to an area it seems to dominate. We saw this in various places, such as Christianity supplanting Hellenic, Germanic, Celtic, and Slavic beliefs. We saw Islam supplanting Zoroastrian and African pagan beliefs, and we saw Judaism supplanting polytheistic beliefs in Judea. Why does this trend seem to also carry though history? As whenever Europeans colonized a new area of the world the natives seemed to usually convert very quickly. Is there a reason Monotheistic beliefs have so much more power over people? 




 It seems like most English words that have the plural that ends with IES has a singular that ends with Y, why is this different with movies but seems to be the case with most other English words? 




 Huh. Imgur seems to have gone ahead and removed those *"horrible fake racist facts"* 




 doot doot 




 You're thinking that Republicans would make anything much better. 




 Just because there were a lot of them doesn't mean they weren't centralized. When I say centralized I simply mean that the way the governments of those nations worked was by having a series of small scale administrators running the nation and paying nearly all of their collected taxes, men etc forward to the Emperor. Contrast that with CK2 Mechanics in which there are relatively few larger lords who take cuts of everything from taxes to levies. The closest analogue China would really have with CK2 mechanics would be having the Emperor control all of China in his demense, but due to the nature of CK2 that just wouldn't work. 




 And keep in mind, it's a religious text. 




 Honestly the Feudal aspect is why I don't think it would work. At the time of CK2 China was operating under a centralized Empire rather than a Feudal society. The reason I don't think China would work is because they didn't even have Feudalism (at least not in the sense of Europe and the middle east) 




 You'd think such a smart person could think of a better way to put it. 









 Yes. I can finally raise my armies of polar bears and send them to conquer all of Europa! 




 North Korea mode and/or just won a great holy war for a kingdom like Germany. 




 'Tis 'Shopped. 




 I was just stating how I assumed /u/iwilllurkreddit pronounced it without any 't' sound. Of course I don't pronounce it that way nor was I saying that is how it's pronounced. 




 Nah - Zee? (without any stop between the two sounds) 




 It's a neat game, but there are way too many bugs and not much content. I'll be sure to check back in a few months and see how it's doing though as it does have a good concept. 




 Must've, weird. I can't access it either so \\__()_/ 




 That'd be awesome if they did. I'll go and research this a bit. It'd be awesome if I could convert my games considering at this point I play HIP almost exclusively. 




 HIP is a mod, I don't think the converter is supposed to support it (unless that's a feature advertised for the mod which IDK) 




 But why is it a 2048 clone? 




 Exactly 




 Democracy at its worse. 




 Alpha as fuck. 




 I'd be uncomfortable sitting next to this guy at a mcdonalds. 




 I'm frankly more confused than anything else. 




 That's what guys who like that sort of stuff tend to look like... 




 Plot twist: It's a friendly dolphin helping the dog return to shore. 




 They both do, but HIP only adds more provinces, not any new areas (There's no Persia or India either) whereas Lux Invicta expands the map to include a lot more of Africa/Asia. What I thought you were asking was where the even comes from, which is the VIET events thing (I forget the full name) which is a part of both modpacks. If you're wondering what mod OP is using in the picture, it's Lux Invicta.
