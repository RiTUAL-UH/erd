 Trout out of the lineup, day-to-day with heel soreness. Get rested Mike! 




 Never saw that one; added to the reading list. Thanks for sharing! 




 It does not assume all of his actions are those of a patriarchal racist; it *argues* that his actions are those of a patriarchal racist. That's an important difference, and it's not at all a claim made without evidence. 

It does factor in Atticus's gender and skin color; it certainly doesn't reduce him to it. I think race just might've played an important role in TKAMB, don't you? Doesn't that make it worth talking about?

In what way is this begging the question? It makes a statement and provides a good amount of textual analysis to support that conclusion. That's not begging the question at all.

You're not wrong for reading it that way. I find this reading more compelling. I'd love to discuss it with you and everyone else, but it doesn't seem like you're interested in that conversation. The whole point of posting this is to have that conversation, not to downvote it into oblivion because it proposes a theory we don't like hearing.

In what way is him wanting to keep Scout in permanent childhood baseless? It's certainly not explicitly stated, but it's not at all baseless. And how is that the reviewer being bigoted?

I really don't think you've thought this through as much as you say you have.

 




 Explain to me how the article is bigoted, not seeing that. It's certainly not on the apotheosis-of-Atticus side of the fence, but that hardly makes it bigoted.

The two books are separate; that's how they've been published. It's not being advertised as a first draft of TKAMB. If anything, it's being advertised as a sequel. Moreover, you can read it as a first draft of TKAMB or as a sequel or as a separate entity without being wrong. Books admit multiple readings.

EDIT: look, I don't agree with everything the article argues, but that doesn't mean it's not worth discussing. It's a really interesting viewpoint at the bare minimum, not without merit. But I'm getting a strong fuck-that-noise vibe from the downvoting, which doesn't seem to be the way to go about dealing with things you disagree with. 




 I hope those downvoting at least read it. There's nothing in here that seems worthy of downvotes, but maybe I'm biased. 









 I love Torii to death but why on earth would we do something like that 




 I only want someone who's going to be useful going forward, or at least has that kind of upside. The only names that have intrigued me are Jay Bruce and Carlos Gonzalez, but it all depends on the ask. I'm totally content going forward with what we have. 




 He's been hitting way better past couple months. Depending what the ask was, this could be awesome IMO. 




 Got a chance to see him play earlier this year, his approach looked really good at the plate. I'm stoked for him! 




 So I left my desk to poop, and when I came back it was 7-0. What just happened. 




 I like the change regarding being able to move the best 2 seed out of the best 1 seed's region, even if it's their natural geographic regional. Wisconsin not getting a 1 last year and getting bumped to Kentucky's region would've been a travesty. 




 That was also a really good Louisiana Tech team, so it's not like you lost to someone bad. 




 That sucks. 




 Jerry signed Blanton because Arte made him sign Hamilton and he had no money left over for pitching, which is what he wanted to spend on in the first place. 




 Link? 




 Would that be neat though? That sounds awful for that guy. 




 God the team's reactions in that clip make me so happy. 




 He crushes low pitches. More than anything else, that's what makes him so good. He feasts where most batters struggle.

You can see Hanigan set up even further away on that one, and when it came back to the plate Trout didn't miss. 




 I really want to see some extended angles from it too. Watching the replay, looked like there were some quality reactions. Hanigan, Trout, Uehara, and whoever Trout turned around to look at in the Boston dugout...I want all of those haha. 




 He destroyed that pitch too, thing was gone off the bat. Second hit of the night for the team. 




 Revere is a terrible leadoff hitter. No OBP skills at all. 




 Walker's throw to the plate is bad too, but notable mostly because Trout dodges it while sliding on his back. First time I saw the play I thought it hit him in the head, or at least upper body 




 "Like many fly fishermen in western Montana where the summer days are almost Arctic in length, I often do not start fishing until the cool of the evening. Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the worlds great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of those rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters." -A River Runs Through It 




 Also, favourite 




 I do not want this, not one bit 




 Twins 




 I think it's more that he's been talked up as such, rather than actually been one. He's a good player for sure, and I love watching him play, but I do have the distinct feeling that he's been around a long time haha. From afar, it does seem like I've been hearing his name a lot for a long time. Probably just relative to other guys. 




 I feel like he's always either jazzed up or depressed. Maybe I'm just remembering like one time where he got excited and it's dominating my mental image of him.

Also that Twitter account is gold haha 




 Yeah Dakari is awful. There's a reason he's 7 feet tall and barely got drafted. 




 Fair enough, I just interpreted it as attempting to say more than it did haha. Interesting observation for sure, might say something about the myth of needing an ace to go deep in the playoffs. 




 The A's have been insanely unlucky this year. They have a positive run differential, and really have played quite a bit better since their catastrophic first month. But, when you dip to 20 games below .500, you aren't coming back from that. 




 these angles are right angles, homie: we pointing STRAIGHT UP 




 As everyone seems to be saying, depends on asking price. If he comes at a good price, pull the trigger.

Personally, I'd rather us get Jay Bruce from the Reds, but he'd obviously take a bit more doing. 




 Did you analyze how far the teams that didn't win got in the playoffs vs. how far they were expected to go? Is your sample size big enough to be statistically valid? I find it incredibly hard to believe that getting better pitchers does not make your team better.

Whether or not it's worth it depends entirely on who you acquire, how long they're under contract, how much that contract is worth, and who you give up to get them, among other things. Certainly a debate worth having. But getting better players seems like a pretty black-and-white plus. 




 IT IS WRITTEN 




 What about getting a great pitcher hurts your chances at winning the World Series? 




 After this weekend. Then, I'll allow it 




 1. EDIT: I'll buy it, he's just normally more excited. (thought he was out of the game at that point, he was not, I'm a derp)

2. Never knew Home Run Tracker was a thing; thanks for passing it along! Completely unsurprised that was the second fastest homer this year, thing straight jumped 




 Your request has been noted and forwarded to the proper Trouthorities. 




 They just got there too haha. 




 Does this chart count Hamilton towards our numbers? Cuz other than that, we've really been fortunate with injuries thus far.  




 Pirates 




 CHOO CHOO 




 Thank you for responding reasonably to that. A lot of KU people get angry when us non-KU fans feel like Perry has been around forever. It's absolutely this, he's just been talked about all 4 years as a key piece. 




 3rd best, behind the Astros and the Royals. But still! 




 Two things:

1. Why does Shoe look so sad in that?

2. I really want to see Statcast for Mike's homers these past two games. The Tuesday homer's exit velocity had to be way up there. 




 We snapped our absurd streak of RISP impotence and all the sudden it's raining runs. 




 The Angels have won 9 of their past 10 and 5 straight. The bats have finally clicked into place and this team can't keep track of how many they've scored. All year lineup depth has been killing us, but the bottom half guys (Aybar, Freese, Iannetta, Joyce even) have started to hit like they're capable of, and all the sudden we've taken flight. The pitching has been excellent. The Astros are cooling off, and we're only 1.5 back. 

It's really nice to start playing like we're capable of. 




 They're cooling down now, within a game and a half of first! 




 Hopefully he thinks it's tonight 8) 




 Keep the ball down Shoe, just keep it down 




 Me too man, me too. 









 The statistics do not show that. It's a myth. 




 Wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment. Am mostly just commenting in the hopes that MLB sees this on here and adjusts accordingly. Cmon MLB! 




 His stroke was so smooth and clean. Doubles all day for GA 




 Once again, you're not wrong. And once again, if you think MLB is doing anything that will invalidate billions of dollars in TV contracts, you're also wrong.

It's the right way for them to move going forward. But there is so much money to be made now that they won't do it until they have to, until there is no viable alternative left. Channels and cable companies both view sports as one of the few DVR-proof offerings they have, so they're willing to pay a premium on it, and they'll probably continue to do so for a few years because they have their heads in the sand regarding the shift to Internet content.

You're absolutely correct in identifying the trend. Where I think you're mistaken is in both how long cable companies are going to be willing to throw huge dollar amounts at sports (IMO, a few years left yet), and in how willing MLB is to move on from these contracts while they're still being offered (answer: they won't.)
 




 The Jim Valvano/NC State 30 for 30 is called "Survive and Advance", not "Survive and Dance", just so you know. It's a great one though. 




 Angels 




 I see what you're saying, and ultimately you're correct, it's the way things are moving in the long-term. But if you take away MLB.tv blackouts, you will see these billion dollar contracts for teams shrivel to pennies on the dollar, because they will not be nearly as valuable when available legally online, and for a price that's impossible to compete with. They are not going to kill the golden goose until they have to. 




 He's been quoted recently more or less as a maybe. But Pujols doing it will be a pull for him. Would love to see it. 




 Number of comments in the thread is 1 larger than the number displayed. 




 Seriously. I'm still giddy when I think that we got Santiago and Skaggs for him. 




 Yeah, I agree. The player vote took Fielder, which is totally justifiable. But A-Rod is having a great season so far. 




 I'll let you in on a secret: that first half is the only time Trumbo was good. Other than that he was slightly above average every once in awhile, all the way down to atrocious. 




 Aybar getting a vote! .550 average, 1.495 OPS in the past week. A huge reason our offense has clicked into place all the sudden, Hopefully dropping him back to 5th in the batting order is what he needed. He just seems to feel more comfortable there.

Also, he hit his first-ever homer to CF against the Yankees last week, and it was the winning run. Right after Albert tied the game two pitches before too, back-to-back :)

http://m.mlb.com/video/?content_id=214840083 game_pk=414814 




 I for one, am stoked. 




 Lol, all that means is that Ned Yost didn't choose him and the fans didn't vote him in. That's far from "most players and coaches" dude.  




 as /u/jigokusabre said, baseball is a local product. Teams negotiate their own local TV deals, and in that they are able to sell exclusive regional broadcast rights. This nets them quite a bit of money, as I'm sure you know.

If you were to take away the blackout rules, now those regional broadcast rights aren't exclusive. The value of non-exclusive rights plummets, because there are quite a few people who subscribe to cable/satellite TV packages in large part because they want access to their team's games. Many of those people would become cord-cutters, or at least feel a strong pull to do so, if they could just pay $100 to MLB.tv and get all their team's games. 




 It should be A-Rod, but it will likely be Prince. 




 Source? I've not seen anything near a consensus on that. I think most players and coaches don't want to touch that one. 




 Knew this was happening once he got selected. Would love for him to get Trout to do it now too, because their bromance needs more national attention. 




 He went with his player, almost every All-Star manager does it. Personally, I would rather have seen Hector than Huston. He's having a hell of a season. 




 Only time I've ever been to Chicago was the last weekend of June a couple summers back, for a paintball tournament. Holy hell the humidity. 

But you guys have a really cool city! 




 Boxberger wasn't a brutal selection, but I didn't love it. Herrera straight up shouldn't be in the game. Too many other deserving candidates. 




 Last time I felt this way about an Angels player it was Mark Trumbo. Haven't felt that way since he got dealt 




 Oh. Oh my. I'm so sorry. 




 Player Ballot, not fan vote. 




 Well, you guys did manage to snap Sale's 10+ K streak of starts. 




 Reds 




 Indians 




 Well I'm glad you've gotten an opportunity to see it from the other side haha. Now if only we can all take these lessons and think about them the next time it happens to our team, then we'll be getting somewhere. 




 That strips contracts of their social and cultural contexts. That's why contracts were invented, and obviously there are still times today when we need them to enforce previous agreements, but many contracts nowadays are signed because it's the de facto way to consummate an agreement. 




 He's drawn my eye with that stat line out of the gate. Love it! 




 Soooooo....is Pedro even saying anything here? 




 Nats 




 I'm a little more willing to wait. He's super freaking young. 




 Well assuming the player who has a markedly better career line than Harper but doesn't hit well in the postseason exists (I'm not sure that person does, Harper is a stud), I guarantee the data will show that that player's career line is a better predictive major than his postseason line.

I understand the point you're making, I just don't see anything in the track record that supports it, at least on the level you're claiming. 




 Honestly, I think that works against your point. Yunel Escobar is 8 for 19 in the postseason in his career. That's a small sample size, but also excellent performance. Why do you not want him up there? He's hit over twice as well as Harper in the postseason by batting average. Is he not clutch until he proves that he isn't? Why? 

Personally I agree. I absolutely want Harper up there, even though his career playoff numbers aren't as good as Yunel's. But you're wrong in saying you can't quantify that info. I absolutely can. By career slash line, Harper is a much, much, much, much better hitter than Escobar. And that's why I want him up instead of him, despite the fact that he has a career postseason batting average of less than half of Escobar's. Because I believe that career slash line is a much better indicator of his ability to perform in that spot. In short, because I don't believe in the predictive ability of the clutch hits that Yunel has gotten. 




 I'm not saying you can't classify the hits as clutch, I'm saying you can't infer that based on having gotten hits in those situations in the past, you will get them in the future. (Ishikawa I think btw). 

The reason you need sample size on these things is because that's how you determine whether or not such a phenomenon is actually occuring. The smaller the sample size, the less confident you can be that what you are seeing is the result of anything other than random chance. It's like the old flipping a coin thing. If I only flip a coin ten times, there's a very good chance I will end up with a ratio that isn't 5 heads and 5 tails, or even 6:4/4:6. But if I flip a coin 1000 times, there's a very very very small chance that I end up with something that is proportionally far away from a 1:1 ratio between heads and tails. Just because there are relatively few high-leverage/clutch opportunities compared to other types of statistics, does not mean we get to throw out the rules of statistical significance. 




 I'm jelly. He's only been to California once since I've been a fan, and I saw him. Really hoping he tours again soon. 




 Trust me, I've played sports haha. The answer to that is sample size. 5 games is not nearly enough to determine that a dude is clutch. As soon as there's legitimate, statistically valid evidence for clutchness, all aboard! But not til then.

Haha, these are still anecdotal examples. If you look at the data, you won't find evidence for it. Also, Sandoval is playing terrible right now. So is he just only good in clutch situations? Seems like he should step it up every day. And Kershaw doesn't turn into a bum; Kershaw gets left in the game too long because the Dodgers bullpen is so bad. He throws too many pitches, the opposing hitters see his stuff too many times, get settled in, and boom he gets roasted late. 

This stuff slices the other way too. If Harper's so clutch, how come he's a career .200 hitter in the playoffs? Why does he only get on base at a .268 clip in the playoffs? Either he put his clutch socks on to hit those homers and mysteriously forgot to wear them in 2012, or those events aren't explained by his clutch quotient.
