 Of course it affected the local peasant, your crops were gone, your village sacked and your wife possibly raped if you were found outside of the walls. But it was not a outright death sentence like a longstanding war. If your village was close to the local castle you were screwed for a time, but the peasants still managed to live own, i'm not saying they did not suffer any adverse affects but the total destruction of a person's lifestyle was not so complete they could not recover plus peasants were frequently "conscripted" which also if they won the battle was a good way to acquire some nice arms and armor to sell if need be to rebuild.  









 Mercs in actuality. Most medieval armies especially during the 16th century onward or any century past the crusades of the 12th century were mostly made up of foreign mercs  




 True. local pillaging of villages and stealing of crops or torching them was also a huge issue, but you're forgetting one thing, that's only local which would be the villages in a radius at best of maybe 20 or so miles, the besieging army would of course send out foraging parties but only effected the local area. While some sieges could take months or even years, most did not last that long, a besieging army has one major issue, it cannot decamp, it cannot move and it is stuck until the castle is taken and  the countryside for the most part was left intact. You're overestimating the damage of a besieging army on the local landscape, the worst part of any war is not the battles, sieges or skirmishes across the country side, the worse part of any invasion or long standing war is the presence of marching armies. Now a marching army might not sound so destructive but consider this, you have lets say 7,000 men, hungry, some drunk, some pissed off others missing their families and home, the food is crap in you're constantly on the move. What are idle soldiers want to do? busy themselves with pillaging, that's why the hundred years war was so destructive, not because of the constant warfare but because it created lawlessness, chaos and their was always the old score to be settled, without oversight you had lords sacking their own kingdoms towns with no recourse from proper authorities. 

very few armies had the advantage of the enemy kingdom/nation not having a army that could launch a offensive, most were under a set time span to take the castle, leave a garrison to hold the castle and fall back to their own lands. Winter sieges would be horrid for any army, there are plenty of famous instances of armies mutinying after extremely horrid sieges especially if they were not being paid due to lack of logistics with a strong supply line. 

If a siege took longer then a few months, by that point yes your life as a farmer was screwed, because the war would continue for years onward but most sieges did not last longer then a winter campaign.  




 Those are wars not sackings or long campaigns, a sacking in this sense would be the equivalent to a king taking a castle but not marching further for an outright conquest, most medieval wars were sieges not open field battles which would cause more damage to the country side. 

Either-way it all comes down to how long the war was.  









 This needs to be in not the onion.  









 Stalin purged the Bolsheviks(including his right hand man who was a jew) the majority of whom were jewish, yes stalin was a paranoid idiot who was always fearful of allowing others to gain power but he also had a deep seated hatred of the jewish people, most Russians did and do, they have always been scapegoats, just look up the pogroms the soviets conducted against regular non Bolshevik Jewish communities. Sorry i'm trying to finish a paper but I will source the link where it is mentioned this stopped his forward mobility in the party rank's, btw the quote in question was pre-Stalin era, this is in reference during Lenin's rule.  




 Yeah after the golden age during the civil rights movement with the continued economic and political upward mobility of American Jews we kind of had a bad break up. It's bullshit though, of all the minorities in this country blacks should be the least anti-Semitic jews went through a lot of the same crap we went through from discrimination(the only difference is Jews took it as an opportunity, when they were denied jobs and entire professions they headed west in helped found Hollywood) racism/ethnic discrimination and slavery(regardless of how you feel about biblical claims their have been 2 well known verifiable instances of Jewry being enslaved once with the Assyrians and the romans) yet we allow stupid conspiracy theorist, in idiots who claim to be afrocentrist yet when you ask them about the kingdoms in western Africa our direct ancestral homeland they pop a "what's that" fuck those guys in the idiot protesters who have Ferguson/Palestine bullshit comparisons.  









 Obviously you have never been Ridiculously wealthy, upper middle working class are poor compared to ludicrously  wealthy rich people like george lucas in the kind of people who get pissed off at george lucas. 




 Source? damn it i'm a propagandist not a historian jim!

Oh wait actually i'm both. 

More about the largely vacant desolate land of Israel "Palestine" in the 1800s - massive Arab immigration following Jews' return = the true origin of the (today's) so called "Palestinians"

How odd that such last names as al-Masri (the Egyptian,), al-Djazair (the Algerian), el-Mughrabi (the Moroccan), al-Yamani (the Yemenite) and even al-Afghani are so common among those claiming to be "Palestinians."

Today's Palestinians are immigrants from many nations: "Balkans, Greeks, Syrians, Latins, Egyptians, Turks, Armenians, Italians, Persians, Kurds, Germans, Afghans, Circassians, Bosnians, Sudaneese, Samaritans, Algerians, Motawila, Tartars, Hungarians, Scots, Navarese, Bretons, English, Franks, Ruthenians, Bohemians, Bulgarians, Georgians, Syrians, Persian Nestorians, Indians, Copts, Maronites, and many others." (DeHass, History, p. 258. John of Wurzburg list from Reinhold Rohricht edition, pp. 41, 69).

There are villages populated wholly by settlers from other portions of the Turkish Empire in the 19th century. There are villages of Bosnians, Circassians, and Egyptians. -Parkes, James William, History of the Peoples of Palestine, Hammondsworth, Great Britain, 1970, p. 212.

There are very large contingents from the Mediterranean countries, especially Armenia, Greece, and Italy, Turkomen settlers, a fairly large Afghan colony, Motawila, immigrants from Persia, tribes of Kurds, a Bosnian colony, Circassian settlements, a large Algerian element, Sudanese -Encyclopedia Brittanica, 1911 ed.

Felahin? you mean the poor peasents? they LIVED on the land not owned it, the land was owned by absentee turkish and arab land lords who sold the land thinking they had swindled the zionist jews who had immigrated into the region during the 1800's, they sold them swamps and crap arid deserts believing the jews were idiots for buying such land. Surprise tel aviv came from this swamp land thanks to the tireless effort of zionist, now the arabs want to "reclaim the land" they sold at b.s prices because it's nice and all built up. 
 




 Yeah crap, feel retarded right right now, trying to finish up this music history class and debate Jewish topics is annoying.  




 OP it's my bday, screw that complete set crap, lets get wasted reddit style.  




 lolz i know just wanted to fuck with your statement. But yeah their is a generation notion of how people see jews, common traits, nose, fro/curly hair, their is definately some features common to jews but that does not always denote anything look at scarlet johannson a regular blond bomb shell yet she is a jap(jewish american princess, even supports israel and advertises for soda stream) 




 Not really. The concept of a Palestinian is recent, the majority arrived from jordan,egypt and Syria respectively. Their not that diverse and they came in the 1800's. You can look at the majority of their last names in it shows their origins. Stop trying to state they date back 2,000 years that's a lie used by arafat a egyptian from cairo with a syrian uncle who was a nazi.  




 God enough of the arguing. Being a jew was settled in ww2, it's an ethno-religious group, if you dislike this idea of it being an ethnic background as well  as a religion go take it up with the concentration guards. I'm sure isis,hitler and the various other antisemitic movements give a crap if you identify as an ordinary white person they would have still killed you just like the rabbi or the owner of the kosher butcher shop.  




 Yes. That's how the han chinese can tell one of their own from a Uighur and vice versa yet if i go to china my first thought will be all of them look alike no offense to the china men:)  




 Arab refers to speakers of arabic, most of the middle-east is arab and that does not denote ethnic origin 90% of Libya is actually Berber according to genetic studies yet they're denoted as Arabs due to the 6th century arabic conquest. It's more then just a different religion the majority of Palestinian arabs follow Sunni Islam, they do not all come from the same place, they arrived from around the Levant from jordan,egypt,syria and lebanon they also interestingly have a number of eastern Europeans mixed in. 

Also, a new study concluded that the Druze harbor a remarkable diversity of mitochondrial DNA lineages that appear to have separated from each other thousands of years ago. But instead of dispersing throughout the world after their separation, the full range of lineages can still be found within the Druze population.

The researchers noted that the Druze villages contained a striking range of high frequency and high diversity of the X haplogroup, suggesting that this population provides a glimpse into the past genetic landscape of the Near East at a time when the X haplogroup was more prevalent.

These findings are consistent with the Druze oral tradition, that claims that the adherents of the faith came from diverse ancestral lineages stretching back tens of thousands of years.



 




 You would name call me for a cordial post? not really. Catholicism proselytize and so does Hinduism, they want converts and more people to embrace their religion. Listen i'm not stating all jews agree, i've seen and been involved passively in many arguments over how jewish is defined, it's fine if you disagree i'm not trying to put you in a box i'm just going by how i've seen it and how my jewish friends explain it to me which is this:

Jewish is the ethnicity/culture you can be born into and are still apart of even if you leave Judaism the religion. Theirs a notable difference.

Like i said if you don't see yourself as Jewish, that's perfectly fine, your not the first of your ilk to define yourself apart from the religion and culture and you want be the last. Rachel dolezal decided to stop being white, i can stop being black_ racist. lol except if you're a muslim then you could be killed for it but i digress. Either-way not saying people can choose new ethnic backgrounds, what i'm stating is for the majority even if you choose to no longer follow Judaism under jewish law you're still considered jewish.

Karl marx converted to Christianity from Judaism he was still considered Jewish, Trotsky refused to consider himself a jew even to the detriment of jewish people, when a rabbi pleaded for his assistance he refused stating in communism their is no religion. Yet he never attained any higher status in the party because stalin refused to allow a jew into a higher position despite the fact he did not self identify or even recognize himself as a jew or having anything to do with being jewish.

Like i said before you can refuse, you can assimilate, you can be that white dude from Philadelphia but theirs always going to be somebody who will state you're still a jew. That's why it's an ethnic background, i can't stop being black, i can refuse to acknowledge my black identity, cultural identity and stereotypical norms associated with being black in america but guess what i'm still black.

I can understand hating the idea of something forced upon you but theirs certain things we cannot change, you're not a jew according to you, that's great but i don't think that gives you a right to declare it's not a ethnic identity because you don't want to relate to it.    




 We're all genetically related. But no i did not forgot to mention this, because it makes little to no sense, a german jewish or polish family is not related to a polish or german family, jews collectively rarely strayed from their own during centuries in europe, if they did they were ostracized by European communities. 

I have no idea how they're related closely to kurds but druze make sense because their homeland is the golan and lebanon, both close to Israel proper so their ancestors probably go back to the hebrews or Phoenicians which were cousins to the Hebrews.  




 Actually he kind of reinforces the ethnic argument even more and how Judaism is more then just a religion, you can stop going to synagogue but you're still a jew, in no it's not because hitler would of thrown you into the oven regardless if you got rid of your kippah it's because being Jewish is your culture, it's your heritage, your background. You can stop with the dreidel on Hanukkah but you know you want some matzah ball soup, if not then you're a lost cause already.  




 Jews don't refuse, allot of american jews actually have begun marrying outside of their own ethnic group, which has gotten the orthodox in a pissy move and have for decades going back to the early 1900's, which is what pissed off the germans, the germans became fearful the jews were trying to assimilate after claiming for centuries they hated them because they always refused to assimilate anyway this is in part what led to the holocaust.

When jews become apart of the larger culture theirs always a fear among jews that they will lose their respective heritage, religion etc that's why it's sometimes frowned upon by certain jewish communities but never outright hostility, most jews just prefer to marry other jews, i'm black, my mom prefers i would marry a black woman, my sister is now dating a white guy and she's cool with that too now, same concept really some people just like the idea of being able to relate to their childrens future spouse, having their grand children raised in the same culture/religion etc in i have no issue with that as long as you're cool with them coming back one day with someone completely different from your background and still loving them equally. 

In jews don't care to spread judiasm, in actuallity i believe donald trumps daughter not sure got married a year back and married a jew, she converted(ivana trump?) she talked about how hard the conversion process is and that's for a reason, it's not because jews dislike converts they just want them to convert for the right reason and not because they married a jew, i'm not familiar with the entire process so any jew's on here or converts please chime in but i believe that the rabbi refuses them 7 times or something like that during the conversion process to see if they're committed to it. 

Note: previous comment deleted so piggybacking unto yours buddy 




 Race is a social construct, we're humans, in you're lucky in south africa you almost would of been considered "colored" by their standards of the time. In brazil black people would be considered mix due to our white slave ancestors who impregnated slaves, light skinned black people would be considered mulatto's in parts of the Caribbean etc. Ethnic designation is not the best method but it's better then the concept of raced base on physical attributes which can be seen across the globe in various ethnic groups, take for instance Caucasian features found in Ethiopia, whites say obviously we put our genes into them but the reality is the other way around and they came Africa like most of the world population. 




 Actually according to genetic studies most ashkenazim(jews who reside in europe are all 5th cousins or something like that) and mizrahim/sephardim(middleeastern/north african-spanish jews) are closely related genetically with Jews to the point their is no genetic difference, sharing close genetic traits to kurds/druze more so then their arabic cousins. Jews are a ethno-religious group but american/European Jews also frequently see themselves as "white" instead of Semitic, Israeli Jews depending on their ancestry the majority are mizrahim/Sephardi so they would see themselves as more semitic/middle-eastern before white though technically Semitic people are Caucasian either-way the three major groups of jews are all Semitic people descended collectively from the tribes of Israel in genetic testing has shown this repeatedly.

Ethiopian Jews better known as beta Israelite are Jewish by conversion most likely but in Judaism a Jew is a Jew regardless, the moment a mother converts and her children are born they're as Jewish as any other Jewish child born to a family spanning centuries. Same for new converts, the closest to any type of discrimination i have seen from jews against other jews would be during the early years of israel when the mizrahim/sephardim first began to show up after being ethnically cleansed from arab state's, but due to the intermingling/marriages and the mizrahim quickly outnumbering Ashkenazim due to mass immigration, along with Israel having a draft so all Jews end up meeting other jews of different ancestry, theirs not any social or ethnic barrier. I believe the current estimate is in 10 years or so all of israel's jewish population will be collectively mixed to a point where the idea of ashkenazim/sephardi/mizrahim will be meaningless since the new generation will have grand parents from poland, morocco, france, germany,iraq,persia, turkey, egypt, Syria etc it's actually a beautiful thing. 




 Context. Stating the Jew implies something different then saying jews, jewish or we're jews. But it's all about how you collectively phrase it.  




 This is actually not that uncommon, looking back at history, the NAACP was founded by a number of Jews and kept going by Jewish donation's, the freedom riders who were lynched during the civil rights era were Jewish, Jews also fought in the anti-apartheid movement. It's one of the reasons why i support them as a black man, that plus i'm kind of a atheist agnostic in i surprisingly find allot of common traits and interest with Jewish people despite their religious culture/history, the only people i know who don't seem to have this collective hive mind mentality that i see is unfortunately common even among my own people(by hive mind i mean collective reasoning, cultural bias, outrage at certain things etc without taking time in trying to critically evaluate it individually instead basing their opinions on what the majority is stating or doing). Jews on the other-hand are something else:

Theirs a saying that goes, if there are two Jews in a room they have 3 different opinion's. Lolz  




 Funnily enough, Samuel L Jackson was not acting with this role, he actually used to be a crackhead. He once stated the reason why he stopped smoking crack was because he enjoyed acting more then drugs.

 [Spoiler alert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfQJp8RgzHY)  




 My dick. 




 To elaborate why have all examples of Marxism and it's spin offs failed to achieve any of the long term goals expressed by Karl marx, why are the only successful examples of socialism found in capitalistic countries? 




 lmao i'm 21. If i get married this early shoot me, like ha fuck that. SOME PEOPLE BEING THE OPERATIVE STATEMENT! so lets stop insinuating this 1960's pre second wave feminist bullshit about a stay at home wife who has been a loyal virtuous saint who raised the children while emotionally supporting her bread winner husband mythology. 

It's becoming less based on facts, in with the rise of third wave feminism demonizing the stay at home wife role, we should really begin moving away from the idea of alimony when most families are two income households. I can't put financial protections in place in states where they disregard prenups like california, which is utterly bollocks. 

Exactly i never disagreed with the fact she decided to not be a scumbag, but i think people who feel they're entitled to half of my accumulated networth can get bent, nothing wrong with that. I was not referring to her idiot, i was actually giving examples, you assumed instead of reading. In that's the problem when anyone can be awarded half your wealth on such a archaic bullshit notion of marriage in these modern times, the woman who gets screwed over by the dead beat ex husband should be just as pissed as the husband screwed over by the wife, this is not about women it's actually about unequal enforcement of the law based on gender which all people especially feminist should be fighting against. 

Heather mills was a two faced bitch who took advantage of a broken hearted man for her own personal whims, the fact she's even still showing her face without being ashamed is an utter fallacy. Gold digging and bums are a sad state of any society, fuck them man or female, now stop being a sexist pig.  




 Also to address your stupidity. You have zero idea of how their relationship worked or what role she had in his career, wealth and success. Maybe she did nothing and contributed to his stress, which directly led to him eventually divorcing her.. you don't know. So how about you stfu and acknowledge that she did something you morally might disagree with instead of just trying to put her down. 

What we do know however is she married after the fact of his success, he was rich before, in he is more popular in the uk then she was end of story. Those are the only relevant facts. Eitherway i was not attacking her i was attacking people who assume the divorced wife/husband who wants alimony automatically should get it. 

 




 Until you have control of the private industry, then you come for our garden gnomes  




 He means he's going to fuck your couch and then take it, damn commies.  




 Radical left like radical right is wrong, you're radicalizing abstract construct, theoretical solutions and other ideas that when implemented in reality never work out. That's why they're theoretical, in theory socialism, marxism ok honestly just marxism socialism is crap, is awesome but in reality it has never once been implemented correctly, we're inherently fallable.    




 Lolz that's equality. Men feel pissed off when the opposite happens, it's bullshit eitherway but if we're going to keep up the myth of the 1960's era where women stayed at home in raised the little ones then both sides will suffer. Eitherway i'm cool with both. 




 Exactly that time was the 1960's now all women know how to do Is twerk it seems. Lets change the laws stop the bullshit, if you're a bum then that's your own fault.  




 No on reddit everyone can't seem to fathom maybe people are referring to the non stay at home, non committed spouse who did nothing either emotionally, physically or financially and actively was a detriment to the marriage. Jesus the sad thing is you support women who do this then bitch about equality while using the 1960's b.s view of a woman who contributes to the household by cooking and cleaning/raising kids when most of you can't make a pack of ramen lmao

Lets be honest here most relationships are far from a idealistic scenario, if a woman contributed to the marriage in some tangible way pay her but the notion she can get paid just for marrying a guy is bullshit. It's the exact same thing as kevin federline, most guys will call him a bum, however according to these comments most women would support him if he was a woman and that's unbelievable. 




 Once again the majority of women who marry successful men are usually successful themselves, they're not stay at home wives/mothers they have nannies, the women who help or contribute to a successful marriage financially deserve the money, especially if they were their for 30 years but a woman who did nothing or a man who did nothing but spend the wealth is a leach. Lets stop acting like this is the 6th century where women are in the house barefoot raising, oh no wait even then they had maids to raise the children. 




 lmao yeah because heather mills was a cooking, house keeping wife to paul fucking McCartney. Are people this delusional most rich lay about wives/husbands are welfare recipients relying on their rich spouse who contribute nothing but a siphoning of their material wealth.
