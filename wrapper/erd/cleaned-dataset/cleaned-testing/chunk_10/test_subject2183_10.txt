 I better sit down dude

You're sitting down

ok 




 It has been an eternity and i long for the feeling of affection, to care about my meaningless things, be loved or touched by someone but i can't get out. I really start to freak out wondering if i have broken my brain, gone too far. Would my sober life now consist of me being stuck in an asylum. I am now a nutcase and this weird feeling of everything is driving me crazy but there is no escape. I soon come to grips that i am powerless to change these facts, so i might as well make the best of it. Fuck it, this feeling is good and i am good. It is what it is, everything that was and everything that ever will be. I started to feel a nice sense of comfort with this realisation, all my trip buddies are feeling the goodness and are good. I think to myself this is why i like them so much, slowly everything starts to calm down as i begin to pick the pieces up of my sober life. I realise that i am going out later, that it is a saturday; tomorrow will be sunday and so on. time finally exists and I am free to do whatever i want.

I can relate to this so much 




 I sometimes get so busy and stressed that I spend even an hour just sitting down and thinking in a circular pointless way trying to remember what should be done as if I am always forgetting something. I feel stuck all the time so I resort to just focusing on one thing for example studying for a statistics exam. Eventually I get into a thought loop where my mind wanders and then I forget about something important and I just feel frustrated. This has been happening for 3 years and I have been failing college as well I don't know if this is related. I feel like I have a disorder or somekind but would like some input.

 What is good to sign up for in Australia? I dont have enough to pay to ESEA is out of the options. 




 I would swim through piranha infested waters with 45 pound dumbbells tied to my scrotum using Rosie O'Donnell's queef as my only air supply just to shake the hands of the janitor who works for a man who sniffed the chair you farted on three years ago

i would drag my penis(foreskin pulled back) through 10 kilometers of broken glass mixed with cat feces just so i could smell the open anal cavity of the janitor who 10 years ago washed the dirty clothes of some random homeless person that one time walked past that beautiful woman at the local cockfighting ring where they slightly made eye contact with each other. 









  dog got stabbed

 he is ok 









 twat 









 So he's edging? 




 Option A: Take a break and process the experience

Option B: 50mg of DMT! 




 Sound distortion sounds like 5meodipt, what kind of DMT was this? was it from a trusted source? 




 You da real MVP 




 did that still doesnt work :( 




 Yes :/ 




 Should I buy changa or DMT crystals which one is overall bang for your buck and simpler? I have a light bulb vape for vaping the DMT. Is the dosage confusing for changa? Apparently blue lotus is infused with it and it is only 50% so it is really confusing me

 Dwight material right there

 or are they a temporary solution, how does this work? 




 What about if team A bets skins to say a total of $1 and team B bets skins to a total of $1 and if your team wins you split up the winnings by 5 so 40 cents worth of skins each. It would motivate me to play competitive more since I am actually winning something rather than just trying to rank up. Also people will play to win rather than play for points/kills. This idea can also get interesting when bigger bets come into play say $300 knives.

 "This ought to impress them; for once I get some attention my big break :'D" 




 Im 120lbs and I heard that low doses of DMT seem to almost always induce a bad experience and that trippers should go for a breakthrough dose such as 30mg-40mg and that it isn't scary once you are in the experience. I am aware that it is one of the most potent substances and my only experience is with acid and shrooms. I want to test the waters since I don't know what my reaction to DMT will be like.

What is your suggested dosage? to those who are experienced with dmt

 for some reason my come up was 20 minutes, still an amazing trip though 









 im in australia 




 My dad keeps on claiming this and claims that his doctor told him this. 




  actual antidepressant


These have made me worse. Shrooms is the best anti-depressant in my experience. 


Tripping all the time in an effort to stave off feeling the symptoms of depression would be as counterproductive as any mindless drug habit


It seems to me to be a treatment rather than an addiction since the positive effects lasts for weeks after taking the psilocybin. 

http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/opinion/sunday/can-mushrooms-treat-depression.html

It's more of a relief from depression than a numbing escape from it. 




 why? 




 I've noticed that doses of 1-2 grams of shrooms really does wonders for my depression. 

I started to think; why don't people just do shrooms all the time?

 I know that tolerance won't really allow it of course; so what about once a week? 




  Easier to dose accurately.

idk about that i have a scale that goes to the 0.01 and i still cant get an accurate dose 




 yeah to be honest mushrooms were the same as 4-aco in my experience. 4 aco was a bit less mindfuck and confusion. The come up was quick so it makes you less nervous much like how throwing you into cold water is easier than anticipating the cold water beforehand. 




 in fact i think psilocybin converts to psilocin anyway? 




 since i have depression and have tried both and am not sure which one would be more effective at long term treatment 




 Can that mean that you are not getting the full experience of mushrooms? since not all receptor site affinities are being activated

 "Damn what the fuck"

"Ok how long into the trip am I?"

"The trip lasts about 12 hours"

"One two, three, four wait what comes after 4 what does 4 look like? Wait what?"

*looks at the clock*

*clock doesnt make sense*

"Oh for fucks sake I'll lie down"

"What if I am an old man in a wheelchair when this trip ends?" 




 its like an electrode that can release pleasure chemicals 




 Yeah I mean those studies where they can keep on releasing dopamine every time the mouse presses the button so he gets pleasure out of it without having to take a drug.

 I see, and this gammagoblin is on blackbank? 




  Im rather inclined to think that the stoned ape theory also applied to him as his brain took on both healthy but maybe also unhealthy mutations.

how so? 














 I was laughing the whole time, i think i am getting immune to cringe

this is the office material right there 




 Apparently for fumerate its 30mg but i heard that fumerate is 3x more potent so does that make the dose for freebase 90mg?

Also how can you tell if you have fumerate or freebase? I have black sticky waxy stuff with a vinegar smell and a bitter taste.

 On mushrooms that is, I tried many different doses and every trip is just psychedelic confusion in a sort of dream state i've tried 1 gram, 3 grams, 6 grams, 14, grams

Has anyone tried shrooms here and have you ever had an alternate dimension alien intelligent being machine elf type experience? 




 I wonder how much dopamine is raised by 1 hit of LSD since the dosage weight is so small (1mg is enough to make 15 people trip)

 Jesus? 




 THis is as as fake as OP's happiness 




 Why is op still a virgin? 




 i got 4 aco dmt a while back, still havent tried it i think he just disappeared man

 i dont know why I am getting downvoted just because my opinion defers from the norm 




 I'm not saying it doesnt work for everyone of course everyone is different but after going on 90 day streaks multiple times and experimenting I find that nofap and noporn have no effect on my life whatsoever. 

If anything; it has a negative effect overall in that I am unable to sleep due to high libido as well as being unable to focus on work or college. My usual routine is pmo once or twice a day but I will keep it at once a day and I will try to cut out porn if I can.

Women are still attracted to me whether I have fapped all day or am on a long nofap streak. I perform the same at college as well. I guess this is good bye to nofap but I will return every now and then to check out how people are doing. 

Good bye :) 




 what market? 




 he da real mvp
edit: literally 




 sounds like something gareth keenan would say 




 Do you know if it is pure?

Do you know if it is acid or could it be a research chemical 




 As an experienced tripper; my advice would be to listen to music and let your imagination take over. 




 Ok I might be in denial. I feel better now compared to when I posted this. I guess the next best step is to buy a bong and never use a light bulb again. 




 After a lont time I started to learn a couple of truths about life. Ive been thinking a lot and some important thoughts have been crossing my mind..

Anybody else think that "happiness" is overrated? We have a climate problem + we have overpopulation with 7 billion monkeys on the planet. 80% of these 7 billion live in poverty and misery on less than $10 a day. 20% who live out of poverty are overly consumeristic and unhappy. 

I think old ideas of "happiness" dont apply. I think a revolution is going to come soon in the form of either war or natural disaster and it will be about survival more than the petty "american dream".

I think studying 5 years of your life for a degree and then throwing your resume into a pool of other resumes only to find out that either the job sucks or that you can't find a job because of unemployment is a path that too many people are taking.

The last topic I would like to discuss is love. You may find that special someone and spend the best years of your life with them and you will be happy or you may find that your partner is only there to take advantage of you and ruin your life in terms of divorce and child support.


I dont know why I am rambling. I could be completely wrong. But I just wanted to discuss these topics. 









 I vaporised some weed in a lightbulb (I had cleaned the inside so there is no toxic coatings etc). I kept on heating it up with a candle just to make sure that all the thc will get out even though it already looked used up.
Some black smoke started coming out with a really bad smell and as I inhaled I felt sick and dizzy and even now (1 week later) I feel like an idiot as if this caused me some brain damage. I feel sick like I could pass out at any moment and I have been like this for 1 week now. That black smoke looked really toxic as if I was breathing in a car exhaust pipe.
Is all damage caused by smoke healed and reversed over time?
I feel like I was heating up and smoking ash and burned sugars :/.
All of this just to make sure that I dont waste thc :(
