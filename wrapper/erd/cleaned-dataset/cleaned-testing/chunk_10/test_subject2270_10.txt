 i don't know if it was intentional, but i loved the way the word 'shots' seemed to be repeated a lot towards the end.  it was like a secret build-up to the actual revelation that they were actually shooting people.  also, the tone was kind of funny, in a good way. 




 Who said you could die? Not me. No, you don't have permission to die yet."  My boss was a real asshole.  You kids today, you all think the world owes you a living.  Well let me tell you something, when I was your age I didnt mouth off at work and complain to everyone about how many stab wounds I had or where my insulin was.  No, I took it like a man.  You can die on you own time, but this is work and you come here to work.  Now get out there and takes those orders

Welcome to nnn Burger World.  Can I take your uuunnn order?  I kept cringing over the pain in my stomach from a lunch that had probably been tainted.  My boss, see, he fed us all the recently expired burgers and special sauce for our lunch breaks.  And only half price! hed say.   




 this is one of the best stupid things i've ever read.   




 Hey said some guy Id never met before as I was walking alone through a foggy alley filled with needle drug users and ominous men wearing trench coats who kept handing me brochures about how wonderful South Korea is and how nobody ever gets trafficked there.  I could tell this guy was creepy right off, probably because of the nametag on his shirt that said hello, my name is: creepy.  Is your cell phone charged? he asked.  Well, it has like five minutes on it still.  You know, just enough time to make brief contact with someone in case I was in trouble, but no so long I could explain specifically what was happening or where I was.  Would you like to come back to my house, no questions asked without letting anyone know where you are?  Sure! I said.

Next thing you know, I was blindfolded in the back of a car.  This is just like a surprise party! I said.  The blindfold only came off when I was in creepys apartment.

The walls were plastered with pictures of butts.  Looking more closely, I was horrified.  Hey!  What are all these pictures of my butt doing on your wall!  Well, creepy replied, its better than looking at your face.  Listen, are we going to do this or not?  He was brandishing a butchers knife now.  I do believe a thirty second head start is customary.  Fine, but I get first stab. Agreed.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!! I screamed. 
 




 oh my god i love this. 




 maybe they do need me... i never thought of that. 




 agreed, but i'd say a dog is more for personality.  when i retire, i plan to pick one up from the SPCA just to keep me active.  support your local shelter! 




 Just what my daughter said! 




 i'm guessing the creep who lived in my attic and i had the same bus route. 




 i've got a cockatiel now.  they don't really talk, they just whistle.  he's a pretty good alarm. 




 it's happened to a few people around the world, so i think it's a pretty universal fear!
