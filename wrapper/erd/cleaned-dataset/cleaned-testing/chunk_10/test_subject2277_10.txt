 I created a fake account for shits and giggles.  I basically made myself into a  hideously undateable, underemployed, heavy smoker with addiction issues.

I wanted to see if I got unsolicited replies from hot women.

Yes, yes I did.

The site is a fucking joke. 




 Hm, probably have man hands on that keyboard. 




 I think your handsome in a 'professor' looking kind of way.  I like the beard, goes good with your shaved head and the glasses are nice.

Maybe consider making an appointment with your family doctor and telling him how you feel? 




 I've read what you had to say, re watched the video and you're right, he did point to the side walk area.

I stand corrected.

I don't know if he was necessarily deliberately getting her out of the view of the camera or if he simply wanted to deal with her off the roadway.

Either way, you're correct, he told her to go over there.

 




 You look good.  The little hair you kept on your chin, it suited you. 









 By her own admission on a video she posted five months before, she said she suffers from depression and PTSD.

I can't pretend to know what's going through her mind, but those two illnesses can drastically change ones mindset.

I'm not saying her arrest was lawful, just raising the possibility that she may have still been ill. 




 It's pretty clear to me she chose to walk in the direction she was walking and wasn't even looking at the cop when she walked off camera.

Watch it again.  She's literally walking off camera by her own volition and isn't looking at the cop.
 




 ...and he'll have to convince a judge / jury of that. 




 They did follow through with the charges.

She plead guilty.

That's the definition of following through. 




 The legislation is clear when it becomes illegal and the courts have made multiple rulings further clarifying it.

 




 Police shoot every single person with a knife, unless they're a chick?

You sure about that? 




 I'm an ex smoker.

Smoking is fucking filthy. 




 Nicotine gum, snus or even better, quit.

CTC does not owe smokers a smoke break.

I'm not allowed to leave ( and re-enter) for a benign reason, neither can smokers.

Smoking isn't an emergency. 




 Yes, I understand.

How is a smoker being denied a right to smoke?

Smokers are fortunate CTC even allows smoking on their property. 




 I've a 2400 sq/ft home natural gas furnace and finished basement with a 5th bedroom.

Two Tennant's in my basement, I'm single and 3 kids 50% of the time.

March $150

April $130

May $126

June $118

I am on gas equal billing, so I pay $87 every month.
