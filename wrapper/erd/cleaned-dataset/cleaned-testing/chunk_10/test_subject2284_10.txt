 Humor? You think the continued fight against Hitler is **Funny**? Intended for **Japery?** 




 Seems like a Dick to me. 




 Nah, that team built the sturdiest and most consistent bot in almost any robot fighting tournament, Behemoth, but they had to scrounge something together in 10 weeks because robot wars owns the license to that bot (it was used in toys/action figures in Britain) Radioactive is stupid, but that doesn't make them idiots. 




 Not to mention the fact Icewave lacked the ability to do anything when flipped over. People give warhead shit, but it lasted the full 3:00 against two bots that would have take Icewave out in the first 20 seconds. 




 it will be satisfying seeing them lose next week

That's what everyone has said every week... 




 It seems like most of the teams could have benefited form watching season 3 , considering that was the season everyone began to counter flippers with self righting mechanisms. 




 Why would you want to take the chips *out* of the salty greasy paper wrapping? 




 It kind of is for batman, as well as new readers who started with the New 52 and weren't reading incorporated.  




 You're always pretty justifies in shooting the *Literal* god of Evil. 




 Eh, it doesn't take away much from Snyders story though. The whole point is that Batman doesn't know that the joker knows, so when he finds out it's kind of a big deal. 




 You forgot to mention the blair witch project. 




 Y'know how after the fight the guy says "Well that was fun" in a really twee way? Well, If you're versed in british passive aggression like me you'll know that that remark is basically telling they're leader that he was right that it was a stupid idea to go against tombstone with that bot. 




 I think Gareth Evans realized he'd essentially just remade [This scene]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2tLKjeOstg) from spaced  




 Nope. There are some really good batman comics set in the day, for example, Batman:Zero Year is set entirely on bright summer days. 




 Try the 'RSS radio' app, it has almost every podcast on there. 









 It goes deeper than that. It's implied Gwyndolin is actually the puppet of an even *Shadowier* puppeteer who doesn't even appear in the game, Velka, whose essentially playing both sides the whole time. 




 Yeah, It's an argument that doesn't really apply to voice acting, where  it's extremely unlikely the person doing the voice is a representation of the character, I mean, Tara Strong is partly known for voicing ten year old boys. 




 Eh, the fact is, It ended with Superman incapacitated and Batman still walking around. As far as I'm aware, that's pretty much the only time batman has been able to do that. 




 It comes down to a number of different reasons, appealing to audiences, creating characters the execs want, that the creator thinks are interesting ect. You'll have to look at individual games for explanations as to why. 




 I kind of have a feeling part of the reason Snyder wrote Endgame was so that there was a batman vs superman fight where Superman definitively lost. 




 Darren Aronofsky and Christopher Nolan will take ideas from that series for years to come... 




 Is Wonder Womans outfit that absurd? All iterations are pretty toned down from a traditional depiction of Amazons, it doesn't reveal a huge amount of skin, and isn't really impractical. It's quite Conservative considering WW was created by a BDSM loving, Lie detector inventing,polygamist 




 Do you have the moderator powers to make this happen? I might try and hold you to this in a few months [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9kVh5U1dPc) doesn't seem impossible to replicate.

Ground zeroes also isn't just one mission. It's eight, it takes about 6-8 hours to play through them all. 




 And Bloodborne can be beaten in 36 minutes without glitches. 




 Bloodborne can be beaten in 36 minutes. 




 Huh, I thought the missing link was the best part of Human revolution. 




 They let people fund the Justice League, which is way more powerful. Basically, in a world with Thousands of Godlike beings, it's not a big issue if one guy funds 50 Batman esque peak human vigilantes all around the world. 




 There's quite a bit of *Implied* gay couples in Fire emblem games, so for example Kjelle and Severa get a lot of fanservice sexual tension, but they couldn't have an S support or anything, although if I remember correctly there were also a few ending that had characters become 'true' companions *wink wink* etc. 




 We do know the rules actually, they're easy to find online. 




 "Gee, this soccer game is so boring, why doesn't anyone just do the strategical thing and carry the ball over the goal line?" 









 To be fair, the same team made Razor, which was [unspeakably badass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZIVhUA-te8) presumably, they just used the old robot they had for the US series from way back in its original incarnation. 




 Hey, It's my stomping ground! The site comments generally go a bit downhill during E3, a lot of people who don't regularly visit go on the site to whine about how positively star wars battlefront is being received and the like. 




 SO you haven't played peace walker then? Because the Ai in this is way smarter than that game. 




 I can't believe this is below 'some presenter were awkward once'. This is the cream of the crop of bad. 




 That wasn't at E3 though, that was a few months before. 




 Holy shit, the voice in the trailer is [ZEEEEERRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!](/spoiler) 




 MONOOOOOORRRRRRAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIILLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!! 




 That's actually just Reggies' regular summer vacation though. 




 I'll drink to that. 




 I'm not saying that he's Batman, I'm just saying that he's an extremely similar character in appearance and setup. 




 But none of the technicalities you listed stophim from being like batman. He still had a sidekick, is still a detective, (literally the first issue of his new series is about detective work) still uses gadgets, still uses batarangs, still had a batmobile and batcopter, still fights crime in a costume that looks like batmans, still glides around like batman, (and one of the most iconic elements of batmans character is that he glides around) has an insignia costume etc. The stuff about Khonshu is debatable, too, as it's constantly questioned whether Khonshu exists. For a reader that hasn't heard of him, the closest approximation to Moon Knight that they'll have heard of is undoubtedly Batman. Same goes for a lot of other peak humans in the Marvel universe, Like Daredevil and Black Panther, even though they have far fewer similarities to batman than Moon Knight. 




 Fights crime at night, are detectives, have a selection of gadgets, including a car and a plane, took sidekicks at one point, glide on cape, have costumes that resemble the objects/creatures in their name, are unpowered heroes in a world full of powered heroes, use boomerang style throwing weapons, have the insignia of the things in their name on their fronts, are both rich, both had a metaphorical 'death' and 'rebirth' etc. They're extremely similar characters, it's just Moon Knight is less competent and more scrappy, which is a good thing. 




 Taskmaster talks a big talk, but he's a C-tier villain and he knows it. Part of the fun in his appearances is that you genuinely root for the guy not to get his ass kicked, particularly in Civil War when he accidentally shot Mr fantastic.  




 Moon Knight is basically like crap batman, but in a good way. He's a millionaire rather than billionaire, a good, but not great, fighter, and a pretty good detective. None of the avengers know or care who he is, he's going crazy, he may be possessed by a medium tier God, but damnit if he won't stand up for what's right! 




 Battlebots seems to be way lower budget in general than robot wars, so don't expect anything too fancy. 




 Because that wouldn't have gotten the attention, wouldn't have been upvoted, and then another thread called exactly the same thing as this one would have been voted up. To be fair, I didn't put that Platinum games is expected to be working on it in the title, either. 









 Isn't the hat just a regular church hunter hat? 




 I'm probably gonna give it a watch someday, as it sound like the writing sounds pretty top notch, and the animation is likely fantastic. What will make it a priority on my Watchlist is whether it follows through on the whole Yuri thing, as a follow through would make it pretty unique in my eyes. 




 Man, I don't even watch this show and *I'm* getting caught up in the drama. It'll be real heart in mouth stuff. 




 Pfft, giving Lewis and Sjin best action shot? Did the judges not see that sweet hairdo in Sips' shot? 




 Platinum boy strikes again. 




 Maybe he's only read one comic? 




 Reynolds!Deadpool isn't part of the Marvel 'multiverse' because he's owned by Fox. 




 Yep, you pretty much got it. 




 What Baffles me is that people think *comic books* won't maintain the Status Quo. Like the people who seriously thought the **permanently** killed Peter Parker. It just seems bizarre to me. 




 Nope, literally every multiverse version of deadpool is dead. He didn't get a good track record in Elseworld stuff before, and then one deadpool went around killing all the other deadpools. 




 I do think it's just a way to make a fan theory connecting souls and Bloodborne together. You can make a much better case for a 'Joint universe' in Bloodborne than you could in the other souls games. 




 This. People don't seem to understand that funding arts and culture that tens of millions of people enjoy without any input from marketers and executives might possibly be a **good** thing. 




 The obvious one is that the background to the Hunters Dream is full of Arch trees, Yarnham is extremely similar to how 'carim' is characterized in the souls series, and the fluted armor can be seen in deep chalice dungeons. 




 [I'm a big fan of IAMTHEKIDYOUKNOWWHATIMEAN's track from Hotline Miami, Run](https://iamthekidyouknowwhatimean.bandcamp.com/) 




 Glad to see more people are being turned onto this show after Kung Fury and the like. I'm surprised it doesn't have more of a cult following, really. 




 Tis' from the guide. 




 Hey guys... I know this may be controversial and stuff, but I didn't like the dark knight rises... CRUCIFY ME!!!! 




 Ah, forgot about Micolash. Sorry about that. Did you know some people say Kosm, rather than Kos? 




 Aw, if it's set in Carim it screws up my headcanon that Yarnham is Carim, or at least related to Carim, hence Marvelous Chester. 




 You only HAD to fight six bosses in Bloodborne, too 




 Yeah, Batman comics got Kind of Boring after all the Gotham superheroes eradicated all crime forever, due to there being so many of them. 




 It's almost like they have to make Hyperbolic statements to sell their magazine! Why can't it have "Xbox, and Playstations, biggest stealth game, comparative to other stealth game of the time!" on the cover? 




 Considering the Preview was done using the PS4 build, and they both come from future press,  I doubt it'll be too different. 




 Has any MGS game ever used the best box art? I think Konami worries that a handdrawn box art will alienate the bro audience. 




 Ladies and Gentlemen... prepare yourselves.... for the Magnificent SHOOOOOOOOOOOOJJJJJJIIII TABBBBUUUUUUUUUUCHIIIIIII!! 




 Nah. I wish it was though. 




 I'm Looking forward to a new avengers team made up of Moon Knight, Taskmaster, Deadpool, Spidey and Wolverine then ;) 




 Batman and the Joker obviously aren't dead, though. I suppose the better statement to say is that Harvey Dent will never defeat Two-Face, he'll never be able to stave off the madness for long enough. 




 Nobody in the marvel universe will ever care about moon knight, the Joker will never kill batman, batman will never kill the Joker, Two Face will never reform, squirrel girl will never be beaten, Thanos will never actually go on a date with death. There are some, you just have to think outside the box! 




 Batman in general is probably the superhero with the highest proportion of good stuff. Since Tim Burtons batman, he's always been genre defining SOMETHING, Film, comics, games, animation, masses and masses of quality content. 




 Couple of hours at the most. I'm kind of staggered. There's already another comment on the video from a different guy, too. 









 PRAISE EBERON! HERO OF THE TWENTY FIRST AGE! 




 Ubisoft doesn't want to do a Asian assassins creed because they think ninjas are overplayed. (and that a japan AC would make a lot of money on a rainy day) 




 
Basically every Pixar film is essentially the product of months of meddling from the Pixar 'Brain trust' of producers and directors, who make suggestions that completely change the nature of the movie. 




 You don't like Mr caffeine? What a poop on your toothpaste thing to say. 




 well, uk ninja warrior doesn't have reality show bits so eh...... 




 Just weigh the negatives up against the positives, and your personal sentiment towards the film. You don't need to have a 'list' to go through, as it's not like you're gonna crack some mathematical formula that makes everyone agree with you. The reason a five star system is used a lot is because it's deliberately vague, and means that the majority of the time you don't have to judge one movie you really liked as objectively better than another movie you really liked.


My advice is to read a lot of criticism to see how they do it. Look at den of geek, or Roger Ebert.com or Total Film, or listen to Mark Kermode and see how they appraise things. 




 Animation is usually conceptualized at the storyboard stage, which is where the majority of the camera movements will be visualized for the artists to work on. The director an cinematographer should be on hand at every stage of animation (3D animations in particular goes through 4-5 different 'builds' of the film) to make sure this vision gets translated to the final product. Interestingly, Mad max: Fury road was also essentially made from a 'script' of 2700 storyboards. Claymation will either us a mix of these techniques or be shot traditionally, just on a smaller scale 




 I'd love to see sips give bloodborne a shot. 




 The new secret six book essentially has catman as the main character. 




 Aim to keep as little distance as possible between your finger and the button between each tap, rather than simply trying to brute force your way through using regular taps like in the rest of the game. 




 I don't buy it. That trait is already possessed by a number of supervillians and heroes in the DC universe. If the Joker was one of them, it would be brought up in one of the events that features metafictional themes. 




 Wait, when has this been brought up? Isn't hypersanity a trait possessed only by psycho pirate and animal man? Isn't hypersanity extremely valuable for building reality warper machines in the DC universe?  




 Well established *in what?* 




 Chris Kamara's relentless enthusiasm sure is infectious. 




 It's kind of satisfying seeing more people given the opportunity to fail though. Seeing 250 people get whittled down to 0 over 8 hours is pretty exhilarating.  




 Perhaps his role will be expanded upon in DLC? or perhaps he'll be a character similar to the asylum crow in Darksouls: and entity whose intentions never become entirely clear. 




 Yeah, that **WAS** an odd episode of psycho pass. 




 So in the final of UK ninja warrior it essentially turned into an exact replica of the Japanese show and it's pretty glorious, with the 2nd round remaining unbeaten by a single second. The sheer arsehurt on twitter could power a thousand suns. 




 Yeah, whilst I accept the idea of the two works taking elements from each other, I can't deny I get a little annoyed when people proclaim Kung Fury the best thing ever despite the fact Danger 5 has *three hours* of this material and is nowhere near as popular. 




 It's surreal humor that isn't particularly '80's' too. It's not like there was a popular show in the 80's that had someone be shot through a telephone and had animals represented by humans with animal heads. 




 Each to their own. I think Danger 5, to me, has considerably more likable characters and more grounded action. But that's just me. 




 Danger 5 manages to cope with it pretty well. It's basically this premise made into six half hour episodes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYXHzOqnMpk) 




 Have to say, having just watched Danger 5 season 2, the similarities are really distracting, right down to shooting people through a telephone, dinosaur headed men in a police station, going back in time to kill Hitler... [For context this is danger 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYXHzOqnMpk) 




 To be fair [McIntosh's criticism wasn't exactly endearing to other critics, either] ( https://twitter.com/tonyszhou/status/601144102755835904) 




 Why are GG guys so annoyed with a Tory Government that is all about protecting the rights of the rich anyway? Because of all the spying/surveillance/stripping of civil rights? 




 Yeah, but Batman has always looked like an irresponsible lunatic (fights crime with children/teens) when you put that much thought into him, and it's not like that's gonna particularly affect his standing with the Justice League or anything.
