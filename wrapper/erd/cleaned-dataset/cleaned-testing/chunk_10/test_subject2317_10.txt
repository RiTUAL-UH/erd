 For context we are both in our mid-twenties. I am coming to you guys for insight in depression in relationships, where /r/relationships would just tell me to leave her and move on.

So the skinny is I met this girl 5 months ago and we instantly hit it off. Same interests, same intelligence, same humor, same sex drive, we could talk at length about anything. She told me from the beginning I met her in a dark place due to life events and a break up that really hurt her a month before I met her. She has a family history of depression (sister, mom) but has never herself been diagnosed. In the last month she has acted really distant, making snide comments, not responding to my messages, and being overall cold which is not her style. Her affect was flat, she was sleeping 10-11 hours a day and was crying quite a bit. I tried to support her through this all.

Last week she told me the relationship was stressing her out and she needed time to process things from when before we met. She said she has never had a guy like me, and really hates to lose me. She said at some point she may be able to make something work but I shouldn't count on it. I want to be there and support her through this and still be her friend. I want that because I want to keep the hopes alive of having something in the future, and because she wants me to be her friend. What do you guys think about all of this?

Tl;DR - lady friend with possible depression ended things to deal with emotions. I still want to support her and be around her with the hopes of dating in the future. What should I do? 




 As someone who has never seen the show, I'm trying to find the humor in slapping a child and threatening his family. If someone can explain context I would be grateful. 




 Well, I guess it is time. Hello gray friend! 




 Thank you very much for your input. I am just beginning my project so I am just trying to collect some raw data at this point. Later on down the road would you and some of your classmates be willing to fill out a questionnaire at some point? It probably wouldn't be for awhile.

I think the key for both fields to work together is to find common ground and to learn more about the other field. I think too often naturopaths are labeled as not using evidence and allopaths are labeled as pill pushers too busy for their patients. Common ground is easy, we both want what is best for patients. As for the later, what is a good resource for learning about evidence of naturopathy? I have read a little bit on UpToDate and we did have a lecture about natural remedies in my pharmacology class. 



*Edit*: Do you know of other good forums/resources where I could talk with other naturopaths and patients?

 Basically I see this movement as a symptom of problems in the allopathic system (too much drug emphasis? Not enough time spent with patients?).  I am looking to talk to providers and patients a like. If any of you have opinions or connections I would love to hear them. 




 Melee lags when played in an HD TV. Hopefully you still have a cathode laying around still. 




 More than likely not. There would be a lot more blood because the explosion would have to go through a lot of body parts and vessels which all would have been pushed into the air. Plus there is a lot of connective tissue around the intestines so they would look clumpier.
