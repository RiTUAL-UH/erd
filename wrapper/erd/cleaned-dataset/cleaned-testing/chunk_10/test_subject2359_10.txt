 Benghazi is like a religion to some people.  I mean ... is it all they have to keep them going? 




 They might like it even more in /r/scifi, because this feels like something out of one of those old DAW yellow-spined novels from the '70s.  Which were awesome. 




 I feel pleased to have at least a few books published in the 1880s   1890s,* and a whole lot more from the next few decades, but I'm interested in how common it is to have *really* old books.


*"Ganot's Physics," 1886, and "Aspects of the Earth," 1889, both of which have wonderful illustrations. 




 The color range feels like exactly the reverse of what it should be. 




 Her comment about Ambrose beating his whores, when explaining her motivation for helping Kvothe steal back Denna's ring.  It was obviously based on personal experience.  That, and other subtle clues that she very frequently entertained males guests of, shall we say, brief acquaintance.

She also offers to sleep with Kvothe in exchange for getting into the archive, like it was a usual business tactic of hers.

EDIT: And there seems to be a bit of downvote brigading going on, for no reason.  Anyone else notice this? 




 In case it wasn't obvious, she also makes money as an escort/prostitute.  That may be how she set herself up so fast. 




  Does anybody know another source for that than this book,

William Manchester mentions it in *The Arms of Krupp*. 




  You've become everything you ever hated.

You either die a fabled Chinese warrior-woman disguised as a man, or live long enough to become a buttered popcorn jellybean. 




 Right, no answer. 




  even when the damage is as plain as noses on faces

If it's so plain, why don't you say what it is, instead of repeating Teabagger whargarrble. 




  If I could babysit kids for 8 hours every day, have summers off, and make as much money as someone who studied 8 torturous years in college

... you wouldn't be a public school teacher, because that doesn't describe their life *at all*. 




  are teachers saying they'd teach better if they were paid more?

No, but a higher quality of teacher could be brought into the field to start with if they could actually make a living that way.  A lot of well-qualified people stay away from public school teaching due to low pay. 




  Why can't it be SHARED? Why do the people who have been there since the Bronze age (Jews) have to leave?

The Palestinians are the ones currently being kicked out of their homes.  No amount of literally ancient history can justify that. 




  If Iran gets a nuclear bomb, it will balance out the power between Israel and Iran right now.

Not particularly.  Even when Israel faced an existential threat in '67 and '73, they didn't use nukes.  They didn't use them against Iraq in the '80s.  Why expect a nation like Iran to behave any less rationally?  They don't have any use for nuclear weapons beyond pure deterrence, same as Israel, India, and Pakistan. 




  The deal won't work and Iran will continue to develop nuclear weapons.

Do you also have tonight's lottery numbers? 




 Jews have been in the West Bank since before the 4th Century BC.

So have a lot of other people, who went on to continue living there until before the Balfour Agreement.

 But they shouldn't even be there right? Wipe them out. Destroy all traces. 

Hey look, it's that thing I didn't say.

So weird that 2000 years of history is dismissed

Yes, it is weird that you're ignoring almost 2000 years of the Palestine region having a very small, non-sovereign Jewish population, while being heavily inhabited by Arabs, some of whom still live there and would like to keep the land they're currently living on. 




 Israel only acquired physical authority over the West Bank in 1967.  And ... did you just say that the West Bank belongs to the PLO because King Hussein gave it to them?  That's sort of an admission of Palestinian ownership. 




 "Very, very distant ancestors of ours lived here 1900 years ago" isn't a real strong claim to land.  As recently as 1905, Jews made up less than 5% of the population of what was then called Palestine (and has been called Palestine since Roman times). 




  The Stimulus was supposed to create tons of jobs

It did. 




  ... in order to defend themselves from the results of our presidents actions/inactions.

The result of those actions being ... Iran not building a nuclear bomb.  But I guess Israel needs to defend themselves from ... that? 




 Same here. 




 Thank God no other major global religions have institutionalized problems with child sex abuse. 




  Why do we invite these people in?

We're on pretty good terms with Kuwait.

Why must be punish ourselves like this?

Like what?  The last mass shooting was a racist white redneck from the heart of Real America. 




 And that's probably the primary reason he didn't get a deserved Medal of Honor. 




  This deal reminds me of Neville Chamberlain coming back from Munich 

I'm sure it only does so because you're ignorant of what happened in either Munich or the current deal with Iran.
 




  and /r/mealprepsunday

This is the sub I've been looking for without knowing I was looking for it.  Thank you. 




 I bet they didn't. 

It was done, yes, 

Complete retard in two posts. 




  I bet they didn't.

Except for the part where, you know, they admitted to having done so.  Which you would know if you'd read the fucking article. 




  okay an explanation, it's like if pokemon could digivolve. So Charizard gets a battle only transformation to a stronger form

None of that made any sense to me. 




  I was a teenager when you were born. Feel better?

I was a teenager when you were a teenager when /u/lurknomoretoday was born.  I don't feel better. 




 All I can think is that if my parents had caught me doing any of that stuff, they'd have cracked open a beer and egged me on. 




  for what it's worth he's won more playoff games than Andy Dalton.

That's actually not worth very much. 




  We have cut down on the partying a long time ago.

Well, yeah, the school year's been over for like a month now. 




  NFC west doesn't have any RBs with QB like qualities

I was going to ask about Michael Robinson, but checked and saw that he retired. 




  Never seen snow in my life.

... that's just really strange to me. 




  QBs throwing 100 mph etc...

Now if only Kaepernick *wasn't* able to do that - and apparently nothing else, it might actually be an improvement. 




  Homie don't play that.

And then you'll have to explain where "homie don't play that" came from, who Fire Marshall Bill was, and what a Fly Girl is. 




 Water - not even once. 




  A drone is the size of a bird, are you telling me a bird could down a helicopter?

Yes, actually one could.  Birds are also a flight hazard to helos and larger aircraft.  And drones are made of metal and plastic, which are more of a threat to cause potentially fatal damage. 




 I'm looking to do a badhistory write up of parts of "A People's History of the United States," and I don't even know where to begin. 




 Are you saying it's not true that several countries with extremely strict gun laws don't not lead the world in homicides, but in fact just the opposite? 




  If the murders just switched to knifes

If, if, if.  Hey, let's look at what *what is actually the case.*   




 And if my aunt had balls she'd be my uncle.  But hey, let's talk about what's *actually true*. 




  America has a much higher population,

That's not how rates work. 




  There is no gun problem.

Then, clearly, no one needs to own one. 




 Do you know how statistics work? 




  Also we should be looking at homicide rates, not gun homicide rates

Yeah, because that makes sense, when talking about gun laws.  Hey, let's talk about other, non-related stuff!

because the point of gun laws is to reduce the overall homicide rate, not just a particular type of homicide.

That's the opposite of reality.  That's like saying seat-belt laws are intended to reduce the overall mortality rate, rather than the car-crash fatality rate.  Because that's pretty fucking stupid. 




  If I were to deny the existence of any country, it might be Liberia, just based on pure, unadulturated unusualness.

I'm still kind of suspicious about Moldova, myself. 




  Also, why is Liberia in quotes. Do they not acknowledge its existance, 

Reddit has actual, non-trolling Flat Earthers.  Are you surprised at the possibility of Liberia-Truthers?  Because like denying Finland exists, I wouldn't be surprised that it's a thing.
 




  Mexico is "gun free"

No ... no, it isn't.

 




 The cited gun homicide rate is per 100,000 people.  Per capita renders raw population numbers irrelevant. 




  U.S. also has a higher population then Australia almost 400 million compared to almost 30

Completely irrelevant when talking about per capita rates.

Australia is also an island with next to zero illegal immigration and non pores border.

That's hilarious.  You are aware that illegal immigration is a pretty big issue in Australia? 

And what does illegal immigration have to do with gun crime? 




 Key line:

The  US now has a gun homicide rate 370 times that of Australia's,  Mr Chapman writes.

I'd love to hear the NRA explain how this is *bad*. 




 I'd be more inclined to give some of you people rides if you used the shower that's, like, thirty feet behind you. 




 Chester, in front of the laundromat.  I was doing some laundry while he was out there. 




 That's not very fun. 




 And yet the biggest tits still belong to the dudes.  I mean, I'm not saying that's sad, but ... that's pretty sad. 









  Worls War 2 was only 30 some years before the 70s 

... yep, the math checks out. 




  I have 13 dollars in my bank account, but you don't hear me bragging about it.

No, that's more of a humble-brag, Mr. I-Can-Afford-Real-Soup-Instead-of-Top-Ramen-Or-Maruchan.  Way to drop those digits just oh-so casually. 




  Mushy and pretty flavorless.

I've heard testicles described this way before, usually by ex-girfriends. 




 No, he's just an attention-seeking douche. 




 I guessed New Mexico.  Only off by 10,000 miles, but that's better than usual for me. 




 That's definitely in "report to the police" territory, right there.  Call up the Sheriff's Dept. 




 Shots retired. 




 Ahh, beforeitsnews.com  For people who don't trust the sell-out, mainstream corporatism of zerohedge.com. 




 There's plenty of speculation. 




  Why the fuck don't they reverse the trades?

Because it was a stupid part of the plot as a result of the writers thinking they were far more clever than they really are. 




 You mean Seahawks legend Warren Moon? 




 True discipline is only reading each leaf of the Far Side calender on its given day. 




 This doesn't explain the modern-day Kote/Kvothe, that Bast, Chronicler, and everyone everywhere knows about, and is still alive. 




 We also don't have 20,000 miles of arctic coastline including a few major ports, so ... we don't need to be. 




 As soon as we can expect you to make an intelligent post. 




  By freeing slaves, Lincoln recognized it as sovereign.

That is completely and utterly wrong.  The Emancipation Proclamation specifically was based on the understanding that he had the power to free the slaves in rebelling territories, in his role as Commander-In-Chief.  




 AND BREAKFAST.  AND LUNCH.  AND SNACKS. 




  HOLY SHIT 78%


Only one other person on the list just barely cracks 70%. That, and the 13.3% TD percentage - 11 out of 83 passes were TDs.

 




 Yeah it does - it tastes like sugar. 




 That somewhere is reddit. 




 They could point out certain specific astronomical or geological events in advance.  Earthquakes, hurricanes, specific cloud-patterns on the gas planets, etc. 




 There are still plenty of great opportunities for when someone asks you if they could buy a Vowell.   




 Bananas and lemons. 




  Cut away view shows the inside of the ship.

... which is exactly what this image does.  What exactly do you think is going on?  You realize you can't actually see the aircraft below deck from the sides, right?  Or see them with their wings folded lined up in rows in the hangar? 




  placing unrealistic sanctions on Japan

The sanctions were a direct response to a war of aggression being waged by Japan.  They were not an attempt to cause a war, they were a response to a war *already being fought*. 




 That's not a cutaway.

...

 Instead of downvoting me for being correct,

You are incorrect.  It *is* a cutaway. 




 So ... you'd like to go back to some imaginary time?  Well, have fun with that.  Dropping some acid might help. 




  Obama says the border is secure!

Don't you wish we could go back to the good old days, before Obama was President and there were no illegal immigrants? You know, that time that *never fucking existed*.

 




 Plant it.  I did that a month ago, and it's growing fine. 




 Just dump a bunch of them into some vodka and wait a few days. 




 Way ahead of you on that. 




 And?  You say that like it's a problem. 




  To be fair, ice cream with salt or pepper would be equally as shitty.

I, uh, don't think you understand how ice cream is traditionally made.

 




  unless Kaepernick manages 400 yards rushing


Well, I mean ... it's not impossible. 




  How come there is never any official response via Reddit admins/staff during huge events like this?

Because there's never been any consequences for ignoring us. 




 And here I thought Big Ben was such a nice guy. 




 "Anyone not wearing 2,000,000 sunblock is about about to have a really bad day." 




   /r/pics just went down. It's the biggest sub on the site.

Between that and /r/AskReddit, reddit just shot itself in the foot big-time, revenue wise.  Never mind the pure bad PR. 




  You will survive a day or two without Reddit.

You can't prove that. 




 I'm kind of shocked that someone as classy as /u/Up-The-Butt_Jesus is an /r/watchpeopledie subscriber. 




  The capitalist system we live in necessitates such actions.

OK, now I just wonder if /r/Communism is going private, as a way of protesting by depriving reddit of a small amount of ad-based revenue. 




  I'll have to like....go outside or some shit

Why would you do that?  /r/outside isn't even a very active sub. 




  It shows that AskReddit alone has paid for over 30 years of server time. This is not an error.

Oh, there's an error all right.  And this chart sums up what it is. 




 I really kind of wonder just how important gilding in major subs is, financially.  Ad revenue is probably a lot higher, even on an individual client basis.  Of course, that's gonna get fucked, too. 




 Sleat semi-confirms the Ambrose connection; and the Horse and Four was confirmed by Anker.

Also, he was *definitely* committing malfeasance against Kvothe, and Devi didn't sound like she was making up the "he beats his whores" line. 




 It's like they don't understand America. 




 Chester here, 98.  Which isn't right man, it's just not right. 




 Anton Antonov-Ovseyenko, then. 




 It's because the people that vote for him typically have the IQ of an unplugged refrigerator. 




   It's almost feels like Texas has a different "Southern" identity than "Southern" people living in MS, AL, GA, etc. 

I think it's also because only a few minor campaigns were fought on Texan soil - the state was cut off pretty early by the Union securing the Mississippi.  So there's no "battlefield memorial every time you turn around" feel. 




 Instructions unclear, now captain of a starship. 




 Feel free to send me your copy. 




 They would be drunk and snorting coke off a hooker's ass, most likely. 




 I thought Crowe worked out all right as Jack.  But I also spent the whole movie thinking that the actor playing Stephen was Jude Law, so I might not be the best judge of such things. 




   A hat was nearly as mandatory as pants or a skirt.

Since when are pants mandatory? 




 It's a lot easier just to ask which non-slave-owning states were a part of the Confederacy, and which slave-owning states were part of the Union.  It's not a coincidence that the answer to both is "none." 




 Hey, tone down the language a bit.  No need to be so insulting. 




 They also had him for some reason destroying a door.

Sounds familiar.
