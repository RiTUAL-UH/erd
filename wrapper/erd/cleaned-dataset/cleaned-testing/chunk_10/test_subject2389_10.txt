 Mad Men. The last episode was so lame. 
 




 Me: Hi there. How can I hel-

Him: Stop talking! I love your hair!

Me: Ok you just insulted me on four levels. Take a seat so I can take you through each of them, in depth, while I make your cocktail.  




 Hahaha I live in Brisbane.  




 Pronounce the T in 'often'.  




 Dad? 




 Do you want sweet, sour, bitter, fruity, savory? Do you have a preference on base spirit? 

If nothing comes from that then classic daiquiri or southside.   




 Heh bar comp parties are loose as hell and one of the reasons I do this competitively. I just submitted my drink for diagio aus round two. I'm just surprised that most of what I see on this sub tends to be beginners or a little pub/speed bar focused, not that much emphasis on cocktails. Am I on the wrong sub? 




 I haven't seen much on /r/bartenders about the competitive cocktail world. So just putting it out there. I'll post my drinks if you want and we can chat. I'd be interested to hear how these competitions work in other countries. 




 One of my best girlfriends at a party. We were gonna smoke some bongs so the host stands up and says "I'll go get the coffee grinder." And this girls looks up and says "Oh are we going to have, like, weed and espresso?".  




 Out Cold 




 Condom/tampon pack.

We're going out because its my coworkers last night and tomorrow I'm going to a birthday party. Im looking forward to havong a shot of rum when we get to the next bar.
