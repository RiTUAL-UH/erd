 So in the store you will notice TV's playing stupid commercials about products they carry. These have been around for awhile, but recently they installed newer monitors that have what appear to be webcams at the top of the screen. I'm assuming they're for facial recognition software, but I just though I'd let you all become aware of this latest installation.  




 Took 3.5 years to buy a decent camera 




 My last girlfriend said she got gifted multiple games on Steam from random guys she's never met. I really don't see the point as the guy 




 I'd say the best advice is to look at the pre-reqs you need on your own and make your own schedule. That way you can just show it to your advisor and they can change it as needed 




 Right? I love the book The Outsiders and they're smoking at the age of 9. Let's bring those cigarettes back 




 Almost forgot which subreddit I was in for a second 




 But he spent millions on it and he has computer coders living in it in pimped out Airstreams. Not you know, white trash 




 West Coaster here, was very confused by the logo. Still confused by the different names 




 I've never seen a cat jump like that, then it gets flung back like a ragdoll   




 When and why did they stop making things awesome looking? 




 Robin wouldn't have gotten so jealous, Ted probably would have obsessively gone after Robin, Ted and Robin probably  would not have gotten together 




 NPR is the one page on FB that I actually enjoy in my newsfeed 




 Myspace was fun because nobodies parents were on it 




 I remember last time this gif was posted I think to /funny. Everyone was up in arms about how badly the dude got hurt, I never realized redditors were that anti-prank. The dude didn't need to chase after him at all 




 That first one is pretty funny. Just last night I was watching one of the first ones where Ted and Robin are dating and she calls him Teddy bear even though she hates nicknames 




 Assuming their eyes work similar to humans that's an incredibly accurate shot considering the effects of the water 




 And I think it's the 2nd episode ever when he says he was hooking up with a girl in his back seat 




 There's other cans that say "wingman" 




 Yeah, just don't make fun of people for things that are out of their control 




 That final goodbye... 




 This is why we need a redditor to point out another redditor's username 




 Where do I sign up for these? 




 A few more bounces and he'll be getting 1 ups 




 I had Mario Party calluses on my thumbs 




 They also make fantastic salsa 




 I know this was supposed to be epic or whatever, but I was just confused. The Boyz 2 men part at the end was so out of left field and random I couldn't appreciate it at all. It really just made no sense, along with the rest of the episode 




 Soo like how ELI5 is actually supposed to be? 




 At least you can only vote once unless... well you know 









 I'm still friends and roommates from the people on my floor there. I had a blast there, it's kinda loud but you can work around it. Just keep your door open and you will meet tons of people. Also it's close to the science buildings, don't know if that helps you or not 




 That will be a difficult schedule since you will be spending a lot of time in anatomy open lab. If it's only in the fall though and you need it, then you got it 




 Bosco 




 I hate the Robin/Loretta plot. Them being mean to each other a day before the wedding is honestly not fun to watch at all 




 She's hot but Marshal could easily get any girl he wanted 




 Well she was hardly honest with Marshal about the whole SF thing before she left for it, she never mentioned it to him 




 They can't see me if I can't see them 




 This was a good start to the season. Of course, well, nevermind.. 




 And then someone replies with the obligatory other girl subreddit with the super long acronym name 




 he's saying independently he is going to date who he wants to, but if she doesn't like his friends then that is a problem to him 




 This episode was 11/10. So perfect. I didn't like a lot of the episodes from this season so when this one happened I watched over and over. It's definitely different from the normal settup but it just shows how deep the show can get. Just Ted alone with his thoughts and I think we've all been there, and the speech of course. One of the best out of the whole series 




 There's also a time when in like the 2nd episode Barney says he hooked up with a girl in his car even though he doesn't own a car nor can he drive 









 Or we just make short acceptable to wear as a society? I don't see what's wrong with just khaki shorts that aren't cargo short or anything like that 




 If you had just deleted everything after the comma it would've been good 




 I'm not saying it tastes bad but when you have commercials on TV I think you're no longer a craft beer 




 This was really just a strange episode. I like the Robin Sparkles videos but to have a whole fake documentary on a character was kindof pushing it big time. It's awesome they got all those cameos but it also felt like a bit of a waste of their talent to say one line. Just more weird attributes to Robin's character

Also why would they ruin the whole Marshal Lily story like that? For the sole reason of justifying what Ted is doing by being a stalker? Had they seriously ran out of that many ideas at that point? Seemed totally unnecessary to make Ted feel better 




 Had to look it up and learned he's 31 years old. Did not expect that 




 I don't know boxing but I keep hearing Manny is past his prime, but Floyd is older than him. So what makes one more out of their prime than the other? 




 If these are clean is there an NSFW version? 




 *raises spork* 




 Definitely scales especially with bass guitar. Learn scales, then chords, and chord progressions. 

And do practice consistently but don't burn yourself out on it, just be patient 




 Ha the comments "this is turning into Digg" and "this is looking more like metafilter"

Complaining about Reddit's downfall was there from the start 




 Definitely grades. And Finals schedule 




 A game of world domination played by two guys who can barely control their own lives 




 This has been brought up recently on here but seriously why did Barney propose on Ted's big architecture night? Yes he wants Ted's blessing but it didn't need to happen then. Plus Marshal and Lily barely showed up. I think that really piled on for Ted, the fact that his friend's got engaged and no one even showed up for him. Poor chap 




 He just said studying in the tub. The other 85 minutes are spent soaking 




 You've been on a roll the last couple days, glad to see you active on here 




 Pretty sure that guy was joking. At least I hope he was 




 We should get an AMA from one of the players at this game 




 I have no doubts there are more men than women on online dating, although there are a lot of women. But comparing it to the real world is fairly similar, there's almost always more guys than girls at every party/bar you go to.  Just gotta do what you can 




 This episode was actually pretty funny with all their different stories in Barney's apartment. I love at the end when Patrice asks what Lily and Ted are doing there and Barney says he doesn't know his friends are just intrusive lol. The ending made me want to vomit though 




 It was also one of the first. There was WoW but Runescape was free. The other popular game at the time was Neopets, and I guess club penguins if you were into that 




 If UW is so damn great then they can apply and go to Seattle. If being in their hometown is their priority then they shouldn't be going to Med school 




 Also the guy that makes one word follow up posts for tons of karma?  




 My roommate does this, I have to leave the room everytime he eats anything 




 They're real, and they're spectacular  




 Really quite heart-warming. They're mutual teamwork almost makes up for the whole target chinese and arab markets thing 




 Seriously why is dogfish head so much more expensive? My local bar will have all pints $2 except theirs 




 How else will the most people get the most karma? 




 Look up the standup slide distance record. People slide on their knees like 50 feet because they're going so fast 




 I mean he was actually successful until he decided to just cut into the guy 




 How do they not clean up anything before they leave? The spilled food stuff everywhere is really gross 




 Just like anything it just takes some "practice" and getting used to.  Next time you're out try talking to a stranger about anything, ask them how their day is going. People are surprisingly nice. Or make it easier on yourself and go to the bar, order a beer and talk to the person next to you. Then work your way up from there, and don't be afraid to speak your mind 




 Those blood oranges. If you ever have the opportunity to try Elysian superfuzz beer it is quite good 




 Will Arnett is the perfect "business man" looking man 




 Qdoba now has free guac and sour cream. $1.25 is just ridiculous for some guacomole when I can buy a whole one for 60 cents 




 It says Delta Tau Delta on one of the doors

Don't know where I got this but I've had it forever 




 Correct me if I'm wrong but those aren't the voice actors, it says they are the inspirations for the character's looks? 




 My ex loved dirty talk, and I was terrible at it. And she would want me to talk dirty as I was doing stuff to her so I guess like narrating what I was doing at the time? To me it was just weird I guess 




 Where did he even keep that when he wasn't using it? Do people actually carry these all over? 




 Pretty douche move by Brad, which is too bad because I always thought he was funny throughout the show even though we don't see much of him. 

There must be like, 5 episodes where we see that Ted is apparently the only reason Marshal and Lily are together. And everytime it's used as some justifiable thing for something he does wrong, like with the birthday picture plot earlier in the show with Lily 




 So why are turtles riding alligators exactly? 




 I'd say twitter and gplus are fb's nemeses  




 Dat ass. She's got a shelf on her back

 I love the dinosaur utopia that's between the layers 




 Back when it was just simple and easy looking. Had the categories and way easier to find everything, especially random stuff 




 What doesn't make sense is when Barney calls out to the taxi cab driver that his gf is a stripper. He is yelling at stairs. 




 That is some impressive paw strenth 




 I am also 22. Does that mean I get to date her? 




 Would that even be illegal? Tons of bars and restaurants have the same name throughout different cities 




 Welcome to Sports Center 




 For instance the wheel, calculus, logic, etc. 









 Everyone in here debating rotational forces and I'm too stupid to realize the picture is sideways 




 A wise choice my friend 




 Why would they not make Ted the godfather instantly? Lily and Marshal would never ever choose Barney to be a godfather, seriously. And then of course they all 3 are at the end, just like they were co-best men.  I know it's just a show but when it's this completely unrealistic with the gameshow and cheesy music it just makes it kinda cringeworthy 




 My shins were covered, and now they're not! 




 Ahh. Carry on then. I like your beaches by the way 




 And Washington is right up there in vegetable and fruit production, so why take resources from us? 




 Not even a verified email. Now that is self control 




 His brakes must not be working properly

 That's faster than I run a 5k in.. 









 What about the beard guy at the bottom left?? 




 I took an uber on NYE in Seattle. Took like 20 minutes total to get to Capital Hill and cost like $10 if that, and the driver was awesome. Great service 




 What a terrible episode. Everyone is just a douchebag for no reason. And why on earth would Klaus be living with Ted, why would any of them want that? And Lily and Marshal just get written out because baby 




 So it's like the lottery whether I'll die or not 




 I gave my cat a bath today. From the sounds he was makin you'd think I was throwing him down a slide too 




 Seriously was that real like what the fuck?! I can't stop laughing though 




 For that price I'd never leave the room I'd just watch fish all day
