 Can you do the scene where we all try to see hery blurry vag as she gets off of the guy's lap?

 THAT'S NOT WHAT RAMPAGE ASKED!!  ANSWER THE QUESTION.  WHO DID THIS? 




 /r/JustPovertyThings  




 Get out tha way! 




 Hey. Its called Madison Square Garden because its not located near Madison Square. Not because its not square.

 




 plus, angry tiny filipinas are hot 




 why?  I thought that wasn't gonna happen anymore 




 Nobody, and I mean NOBODY at eid prayers is paying attention to the khutba, and I would be willing to bet my life savings on the fact that less than 3 people know what the actual significance of Eid is. 




 Looks like you've been sent to Meowshwitz 




 That's almost exactly how the relationship operates 




 For 40 grand, I would have at least expected some nudity. 









 Can someone keep an active tally of how many times our new glorious leader dances around the issues? 




 **SORRY CITIZEN, YOU'RE ASKING TOO MANY POIGNANT QUESTIONS.  BANNED!** 




 Listen, pal, the CEO is here to dance around hard questions and get popular approval for his upcoming banhammer by shrouding himself in the cloak of anti harassment.

 




 This was not the best fighter award.  This was the best female athlete award.

And this gif is stupid and pointless. 




 Jesus Christ, this shit again? 




 I don't understand either.  The whole premise of that show is that Bones, the fucking title character, is a skeptic of anything supernatural, and goes out of her way to disprove stupidity her entire career. 




 seriously.  I've never even contemplated a 6 team league.  Anything below 12 seems boring and too shallow. 




 even in dynasty? 




 WRONG Shitlord!  Slaves aren't entitled to shit! 




 This is the kind of post that should be in /r/bestof.  Not the same old trite bullshit that's been filling the sub recently

*"this was the top comment of a post that was on the front page with 5000 upvotes"*
 




 You sound like those republicans who started bashing Obama as soon as he was president from day 1.

"Oh he shook the marine's hand!  Terrible presidential protocol!"
"Oh my god, he fucking BOWED to a jap and respected their culture!!  How unamerican!!"

Before he even started actually doing the stuff they were truly angry about, like talking about torture, Gitmo, gay rights, DADT, and healthcare.

And now you're angry at everyone for not jumping on your bandwagon.  We hated the last CEO towards the end of her tenure after she did a bunch of stupid shit.  This guy hasn't even done anything yet.  Nothing.

Oh wait, he talked about doing something.  Totally the same thing, my bad. 




 shhhh 




 Yeah, I trotted him out there for a while, but his inability to fill up the QS category hurts too much. 




 Man, Oswaldo Arcia is frustrating.  Holding on to him in a dynasty league, since there's not much else out there besides Melky. 




 Oh.  Good thing you refuted my claim with actual arguments. 




 So something that's literally been on the front page via 4 different subs is somehow bestof? 




 Dude 




 Thanks Dana.  I didn't realize that companies want to sponsor fighters when they aren't visibly supporting their brand. 




 not with all those jews around 




 **DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WORDS COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH?!?!?** 




 I don't get the comparison.  Kevin is black and looks kind of like him, and has a similar high pitched shouting voice.  His jokes are nothing like Tucker's.  His on stage demeanor (not voice) is nothing like Tucker's.  His acting skills or lack there of are nothing like Tucker's.

This just seems to be some retarded joke that just won't die. 




 damn.  myth busted quickly on that one 




 God Damn.  I would have thought this would come as common sense to fellow ex-muslims who face similar struggles. 




 So, basically whoever predicted that Ellen Pao was a scapegoat for unpopular whitewashing of Reddit was right? 




 He can channing all over my tatum any day. 




 Man, mentally preparing myself for the first Marvel movie when he won't make a cameo is making me sad. 




 Political correctness has gone full retard. 




 [come at me, bro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Drivers%27_Champions#By_season) 




 Not likely 




 bullshit 




 How does Amarican Pharoah compare to Barbaro.  My understanding was that Barbaro was beyong ridiculously gifted.  Was Pharoah's success a result of a weaker field? 




 tell us more, master 




 Is this NDT's alt? 




 You work at Love Field Airport or something? 




 Not if you live in the UK. 




 Yeah, but the new layout sucks donkey balls 




 Yeah, the money looks funny to us Americans.  I was in Toronto on a business trip, and my boss wanted some coffee for a couple of us.  I asked him for some cash, cause all I had was US currency.  He just looks at a stack of Canadian money with a perplexed look, and randomly pulls two bill out and gives them to me, and asks "Is this enough?"  He gave me two hundred dollar bills. 




 Can someone fill me in on this?  I don't know if it's a big enough issue to post to /r/OutOfTheLoop  




 Also, Africa is a country, and Pakistan is the middle east. 




 did someone take away your gold?  I don't see it 




 Yishan looks more childish and petty the more he participates in reddit. 




 Yup.  Sister moved from DC to Chicago, and said that it was a shit show, and said she preferred DC.  Fucking DC! 




 Seriously, I don't get why anyone is complaining.  The children got across safely, didn't they? 




 It's not just the short term success that people in Dallas are excited about with Stephen Jones.  It's the idea that Jerry isn't drafting players anymore, fucking up the franchise's chances for more long term success.  We've had three consecutive years of conservative, non-splashy drafts that built up a solid o-line. (who needs defense anyways, right?) 




 Thus, the success 




 please send help 




 What are your opinions on Oreck brand vaccums. They are bagged units, so would they be serviceable over a Dyson? Especially if Kirby or miele are out of the budget. 




 YES!!! 




 What'd he say? 




 No search and sort funtionality, no more user reviews, no more separate page for each tv or movie title.  What happened, and when did it happen?

Did people actually want these changes?  It makes no sense to me.  They've reduced contnet and options, for what reason?

 The retarded green dyed hair was a brilliant touch 




 The problem is, their thing kills people for believing differently. 




 Is there anyone with enough cap space to claim him off waivers and fuck us? 









 ayyy 




 when did this happen? 




 Sharpie in the butt would go a long way to proving that you are who you claim you are. 




 Not just SRS, but pretty much any meta sub has been guilty of brigading.  /r/bestof and /r/SubredditDrama are two of the most powerful ones out there. 




 blah blah, Nazi that coming 




 Well, that's because they're friends with the admins, so.... 




 All my beams have been melted.  take me 




 Yeah, thanks.  I didn't wanna sleep anyways 




 I was more expecting a kthxbai type response. 




 Seriously, the face off pose with fans and fighters is so cringey 




 [Called it](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3cowz5/til_in_one_season_of_the_dutch_version_of/csxoboe?context=3) 




 but just look up.  I'm not installing just yet. 




 right in the feels 




 Can't say they're not trying. 




 It's the off season, bro. What else are we gonna do? 




 **GIVE THAT MONEY TO DIRK!!!** 




 Satnam 28 miutes per game coming 




 ewww.  so much piss splatter on that trophy 




 I will root for Dirk to kill Bruce Willis, preventing him from making more Die Hards, thus making Dirk the hero. 




 What a fucking G 




 That gif...the fact that the shot goes in just kills it. 




 Dirk will never be a villain.  




 Whataburger is life 









 lol haha lol i don't agree with you so you should be silenced haha lol haha see we're all having fun!! 




 As a fan of elephants, fuck this guy. And Olly. 




 Yup, this thread will probably get deleted for not abiding by the new era hugbox rules. 




 Snake oil is for chumps.  Rhino horn powder is where the real medicine is at. 




 It's like when a black guy comes into a porno where the white dude was all excited and ready to fuck the girl. 




 Houston's zoning laws, or lack thereof, are such a clusterfuck, that we had a full day's lesson on them in one of my law school classes.  Can't seem to remember which one, though.  Maybe Contracts. 




 Yeah, Colin Cowherd is being a real punk bitch defending him this morning.  I hate how he just ends arguments with "so?"  "So what if he didn't call Cuban back?"

He thinks this somehow makes his weak argument morally superior somehow, and ends the conversation. 




 Is there any more of this type of uncensored reality TV nudity somewhere?  Asking for a friend. 




 Damn, these black and white photos had me fooled. 




 Can the Mavs use him? 




 have you seen the East? 




 That's literally the exact opposite of having huge balls. 




 The owner's daughter is hot. 




 For real.  No one is beating those two teams.  Spurs might just sleep through the first half and then go full Popovich on everyone's ass all the way to the finals. 




 Isn't it official Reddit policy for the CEO to trash fired employees, anyway?  So why not talk shit 




 Johnson is not available in Yahoo yet 




 What kinda football stuffs? 




 Stars lending their jet.  This is a Metroplex effort. 




 close enough 




 Yeah, I went back into yesterday's thread and read up on it.  Thanks 




 What am I missing here?  Off reddit for two days and I miss some shit 




 Admins can sticky their responses to remain visible despite downvotes.  




 I want them to make buddy cop movies when they're done with basketball.  But different movies, not a series.  Like, they play the exact same stereotype characters in each movie, and the story is practically identical, but it's just a different movie. 









 Fuck Olly 




 Serious question, why is this guy being downvoted?  Is it because he's pimping out his product? 




 without the pasties, please 




 I'm quite happy with out injury prone guard and one trick pony acquisitions, thank you. 




 This isn't funny as much as it is hot. 




 I guess this is a problem in bigger cities.  I've never seen this out in the suburbs.  Hell, is Torrance a suburb? 




 Why wouldn't you believe?  Unless you can prove otherwise. 




 When we hear of trials being done in mice and showing a lot of promise, how far away are we from human testing?  




 To have a nose hair that's long enough to bother him, but he can never ever find to cut it out. 




 OP dun goofed 




 God Dammit, JaMarcus. 




 How would we verify the AMA? 




 crimes?  a bit dramatic.  I hater her as much as the next person, but crimes?  What criminal acts did she commit?  Are you referring to her trying to make the Internet a bubble wrapped hug box?  Cause that's not a crime, it's just stupidity.

Or are you referring to something else that I don't know about?

edit:  god dammit, I can't tell sarcasm on the internet 




 How old is it? Did it die of old age? 




 /r/floridaman in vacation in Texas I see. 




 I liking your modeler more and more man.  Keep up the good work.  Side note:  What determines your bankroll percentages on each bet? 




 Man, I live in LA, and if I was there this weekend, I would buy you so many fucking beers.  You're a true G! 









 It looks like the modeler is starting to get more accurate. Good job man. 









 Even though everyone knows without a doubt that Aldo is injured for real, that gynecologist line was fantastic 




 best map 




 I personally want him to lead the fucking whitewalkers on a revenge tour 




 I'd be interested to see someone post a reverse scenario in a few days to see what the reaction is. 




 It's definitely not for Gay Jesus. 




 You're a fucking idiot.  




 Dana's always been a piece of shit who would rather risk his fighters' safety for views 




 Seriously, did Victoria piss off Pao or something? 




 So, Susac's value still holds, right? 




 I have him in dynasty, just riding that bench.  When I look up his stats in the minors, he seems to be struggling hard.  Minnesota people, what's the word?  Is he gonna get a second chance, or are they moving on? 




 Yeah, 2006 finals comes to mind. 




 Link his blog, bro 




 Thanks, Dr. Nick 




 No more Tom Cruise jokes? 




 But Roddy Bobouis turned into a perennial allstar, right? 




 I think that the 2011 Championship covered up a lot of weaknesses in this organization and allowed people to keep jobs they shouldn't have.  Donnie as a talent evaluator is just abysmal. 




 Also, Hope allegedly threatened them 




 Wasn't he defending his own mother when Hope was attacking her? 




 Noobish question.  How do I keep track of units?  I generally bet flat percentages of my bankroll, so that number changes all the time.

So, if I have a $100 bankroll, I bet a flat 10% on my bets.  But that doesn't mean that my unit is $10, right?  Cause that 10% will cause the bet amount to change daily.

 




 You started with 500 and went up to 22000?  How big were the bets you were placing?  Were you betting flat percentages? 




 almost too easy.  UFC is so eager to put a fucking belt on Connor's nuts, they've shielded him from wrestlers all this time. 




 Since this is not a confession at all, this will get upvoted to the front page.  Please, let this poor bear die, and let's bury it with the wolf. 




 Thanks.  Stashed him just now in my dynasty. 




 The Chris doesn't want to be there. 




 This kills the cap
