 Nofap won't magically make you into a better (wo)man. You won't magically start to see girls queue up around you. Your muscles won't magically grow but nofap does give you the drive to make these things happen. It takes time and persistence but in the end you will be more confident (and clear headed) but only if you force yourself into certain situations.

You won't get a girl by sitting on reddit all day. Just go out into the world and meet people (I know, I know easier said than done but it's possible). And I know  it sounds cheesy but just be yourself. Girls must be sick to death of sex obsessed men who just want to get into their pants. Talk to them like you would anyone else and you might find that you really like her. Don't get down if you get rejected a few times.

You won't find going to the gym any easier (if you're new there) and it won't make lifting any lighter but it might give you an extra drive (and a way to get all of your energy out without fapping) and it will make you feel better afterwards. 

So go outside (even if it's just for a walk, make yourself walk for one or two hours everyday) and you might be all the better for it. Learn to cook there are quite literally millions of videos on youtube! Start drawing, if all you can do is stick figures, who cares keep going (every master was once a begginer). Learn a language, play and instrument, volunteer! There's so much ***you*** could be doing right now, so go and start. 

Nofap is about persistence and patience and hard work and it won't pay off unless you make it. 




 I'm not 100% sure why it happens but many people report getting deeper voices around the 30 day mark. Don't quote me on it but I think it's to do with the increase in testosterone. 




 Yeah, as far as "superpowers" go it's just a word to say mkre confident, happier etc (I'm sure  you know that but I can see how it can be taken the wrong way). It won't take down the porn industry but I guess some people believe it will. 




 Shit aye!  




 Ha, ha awesome. 




 Ha, ha I know the feeling. Why is it that whenever you read something scary at 2am you have to pee? 




 Woohoo! Glasgow man myself, what about you? 




 Scotland :) 




 Good luck man! :D 




 I stopped shaving down there when I started nofap, cause I often found I would get a boner and relapse when shaving. 




 Don't reset but don't do it again. You're teasing yourself. I suggest you just move it to the side when you shave/trim down there. 




 Definitely get you thinking. 




 Ha, ha woohoo! 




 It might be the norm but that doesn't make it right! Look at what the people here on nofap have went through. Slavery was once the norm, so was burning women at the stake for witchcraft, did that make any of that right? 




 Awesome and kudos, the subs has grown a lot in just one day. Hopefully the viewings go well. 




 I guess all of her dreams were clouds in the coffee? 




 Why not make a conoetition out of it? :) 




 I can name more, there are many in Eastern Asia and throughout Africa. Porn isn't eeded to masturbate. I could link you to more who don't "fuck each others brains out every night" 




 Certain african tribes, like the ones in this [article](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/where-masturbation-and-homosexuality-do-not-exist/265849/) find it to be an alien concept. 




 Yeah, no. Point and case, nofap. 




 Ha, ha thanks. By the way you have a real talent. I especially like [this](https://www.facebook.com/JCMRArt/photos/pb.1594122477512638.-2207520000.1437505358./1622249118033307/?type=3 theater) one, the profile picture and [this](https://www.facebook.com/JCMRArt/photos/pb.1594122477512638.-2207520000.1437505345./1622380971353455/?type=3 theater) one. Seriously, I'm impressed!! 




 Ha, ha I'm Devlin. I'll go check out your art :) 




 Yeah, that got me too. 









 Awesome, I'll gi and have a look. I like big hiro 6, it was a pretty fun movie. Now I want to see you play that triangle :) (can you send me a link  o your art?) 




 Ha, ha triangle is awesome!! (I think?). I love toy story but finding nemo and the incredibles are my favourites, I also like brave but their new mivie inside out is pretty good. Guitar, no not really. I considered learning it and i might in the future but for now no. How long have you been into art? 




 At the beggining. Hi, I suggest you install a porn blocker and maybe find a new hobby (exercise, reading, music?) Then make yourself do the things you want to do, force yourself if you have to. 




 Hey, 16 [M]. I like music (I play the piano and keyboard). I could talk my life away when it comes to history and I have a soft spot for pixar movies. I love lewrning about other cultures (from Scotland) so I'd like to talk to some people here and help along with nofap. 




 I'm not going to write a review of any kind, I'm just going to talk a bit about this book.

I'm really into history, I've read and studied for hours on end about all sorts of things. I spent a long time studying the time periods between 1850-present (although I love ancient history and, well any history really). I heard for years that I should read: "All Quiet on the Western Front" but I always put it off because I was reading sonething else. I finally got round to it. 

When people talk sbout Germany the topic always seem to turn to Hitler and often people are severely under-educated on the subject matter. I really feel sympathetic for the German people of today. They don't feel pride for their country because of what happened.  


Anyway, the book focuses on a group of German soldiers during the first world war and it really captures the essence of innocence lost. Even though the book is a work of fiction it tugs at the hearts strings because to many people went through these situations. It shows that the German troops were just as annoyed about the war as the allied countries. 

It also captures the feeling of camaraderie that was the high point of life in the trenches, like I said this is not a review but I do feel like anyone interested  in war, history or simply looking for their next read should pick up this book. 
 




 Don't get me wrong we're close and we share a lot of stuff. I'll talk to him later. (Tonight) 




 Try going to the sidebar and find where it says:

"Show my flair on this subreddit it looks like:"

And make sure there is a tick in the box. If it doesn't work message a moderator. 




 We're twins so it'd be pretty awkward talk... 




 I woukd consider them to be, yes. 




 Sorry about that but don't let it define you. Just go out and be confident and friendly and I kno it sounds cheesy but be yourself. Don't just think about sex and you might meet a nice girl, that first kiss might not be far away. 




 Ha, ha. 




 Hopefully nofap will fix that, stay strong. 




 Ha, ha sounds stupid but it does work. But be careful, it can make it look like you had an "accident". 




 So I walked in on my brother, let's say, jerkin the gerkin'. I immeadiately closed the door but he was obviously embarassed which reminded me one (of the many reasons) that I'm abstaining from fapping. 

The embarassment on his face showed me how shamed he was. People talk about it like it's normal and healthy and that "everyone does it" but if these were true then why do people get so embarassed when the subject matter comes up?

 




 I know I never. 




 I agree. In many cultures no one masturbates and no one cares, it's not essential. 




 Wow. That's weird, I practice lucid dreaming and I hear a lot of people get sleep paralysis (like you said evil figures and feeling an evil presence). I'm fortunate that I haven't went through it... yet but if I do I hope I don't shit myself (kiding... kinda). I only practice dream induced lucid dreaming so the risk is low. 




 I agree. 




 Hw, ha sorry about that. 




 "What is the story behind your username?"

It's posted so often. 




 Masturbating and porn have become the social norm and anyone who decides not to partake in such activities are often thought of as taboo or weird. So if you google is masturbating healthy or is porn normal/good it will come up with millions of people saying how healthy and natural it is. That is why this sub gets little attention. A lot of people also think it's weird and "culty". 




 Camping eh? To begin with hide it by pointing it upwards towards your belly button. Here is an [article](http://m.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-an-Unwanted-Erection) that might help you. 




 Don't get me wrong I want to have sex, I do. But it will happen when it happens and with someone I care about. To be honest most people our age are virgins, some might lie but most are. I think nofap has helped a bit but I never really talk about it. Don't be scared, so you haven't had sex, it's no big deal. 




 It leads to relapse no matter who is doing it. 




 Awesome, enjoy your hike. 




 Good idea! 




 That took balls. Good job man. 




 What other trails have you complete and how much, on average does it cost per trip? 




 Yeah nothing more came of it. I don't know if that's why we moved, I was pretty young, but I think it was one if the reasons. I don't know if the dream meant anything or if that guy was actually real or not but he was creepy as fuck!  




 16 here, I don't care about it. I'll lose it when I have a girl I care about not just some girl to have it done with.  




 When you struggle don't convince yourself that edging is ok. Just do something, anything, to get your mind off of it. Edging *will* lead to a relapse and if it doesn't it will likely lead to blue balls. If any of you have ever had this the pain is excruciating! 

I'm writing this cause I've seen a ton of posts recently about people who are edging. So if you consider it try and get it off of your mind and if you start think about the pain you'll feel if you continue. 









 Yeah, I agree. 




 Oops typo. 




 'How you holding up?' Asked my mum as we arrived home from my best friends funeral, she died in a car crash just over a week ago

I look at her and she can tell I'm hurting:

'I'm, ok. I'm just gonna go up to bed'.

She leaves me as I retreat to my place of solace. I lie in bed and think about all the stuff we did together, we were friends practically since birth. Her name was Liara and she was only sixteen! 

I fall asleep and dream about my recently deceased pal.

Bleep.

I hear the familiar sound alerting me that I've just recieved a text message. I take my phone and stare in horror, the screen reads:

"1 unread message from Liara"

A million and one thoughts rush through my mind and I finally decide to open it, it simply reads:

'Hey'

I immediately respond:

'Who is this?'

Bleep

'It's me, Liara, wanna do something later'

I reply straight away

'I don't know who's doing this but it's not funny, have some god damn respect for the dead' send.

A tear fills my eye.

Bleep.

'What do you mean respect for the dead? Are you feeling ok?'

The text message makes me want to punch something, someone is using my best friend, my dead best friend's phone to taunt me!

'I don't care who you are, just stop. It's not funny!'

The phone rings after I send the last text. Caller ID says it's liara. I answer it and practically scream the words:

'Fucking stoo it, Liara was buried less than two hours ago, don't you have any fucking respect!!'

'What are you talking about, I'm right here' replies the person on the end of the phone... Liara.

'Wh-what?! How. We, we burie-' I reply in shock

'I don't know why you're acting so weird, I'm fine, it must've been a nightmare'

I convince myself she's right but I'm still shaking from the shock. Then she says something, something Liara would never say...







I would continue but I have to go, nice writing prompt though. 




 I agree. I hate the word "hater" as well. People are allowed to have negative view points and the second they express them they are labelled as a "hater". I don't particularly like pewdiepie (I find him annoying) but his fanbase are the worst! If anybody says anything that isn't:

"I love you pewds you're so funny!!! :D :D D"

Then they get attacked by strangers on the internet (point and case: this tifu). 




 Ha, ha!!

 Yeah there's like eight. They always conplain about how school is useless and what not, most of them leave in fourth year (High school, it's when they're 16). 




 I agree with the junk food point, I've eaten considerably less than before. Also the sleeping. I've had much better sleeps.  




 I obviously don't know you guys but if, like you say, you haven't changed then it might be jealousy. If girls prefer you they might feel threatened. I might be wrong though so take it with a pinch of salt. 




 No man (I don't see a counter anyway) it wasn't intentional and you immediately turned it off, well done. 




 I don't know how you've changed, if your more confident now and better to be around it could be a simple jealousy complex? 




 Not to be mean but man up. If you can't go one week without touching your dick then maybe you shouldn't be here. We all know it's hard (no pun intended) but you should do it, not for your girlfriend, but for yourself! 




 I have an average body but it seems to me that all of those body builder type people are vanity obsessed jackasses. I wouldn't become one but, meh. I'm going to start the gym in august when school goes back then jog home rather than take the bus. 




 I'll die before I see your evil scheme come to throughistion. You won't touch dogs or hoomans!! 




 We here at dogfort signifigantly outnumber you feline fanatics and could break you like a twig. 




 Thanks, I wonder why  mines last so long compared to everyone else?  




 In the US, this war is worldwide!! 




 Cat dominance?! Even the hoomans are on our side! 




 Liar! The hoomans are on our side!! 




 Done. 









 As a catholic I pray but not for help with nofap (I ask God to help keep me going but that's all) I do meditate though which is very useful. 




 I suggest that you stick with nofap, no maturbating or porn. Have sex with your gf whenever you want/can but don't masturbate. It should take between 60 and 120 days (likely 90) before you recover from PIED. 




 I'm going to cancel my xbox live membership when school goes back (sinve I started nofap I've found it boring and I've got a lot more done). I'll substitute it for a gym membership and focus on cardio and lifting.  




 I walk for two hours every day so I'm in decent shape and I eat pretty healthy and drink plenty of water (around 1.5l a day). 




 I don't go to the gym or anything yet but I'm weary because when people get good looking bodies (mines is ok, I'm a good weight and all) they change and become obsessed with vanity. Did you guys? 




 Don't mention it :) 




 Aww!! 




 Don't do it, it sounds stupid but it could lead to a relapse. 




 I'm the exact same!! Day 11 here, videogames have been a huge part of my life for years but the past 4 days they've been boring, in that time I've learned a few new recipes (I normally never cook), read more, went outside more and spent more time with my family! I feel great!!  




 Don't reset, you were unconscious so it wasn't a decision you made.  




 Fish... with whipped cream. 




 Ha, ha good luck. 




 Awesome! Good for you, I hooe you meet a bunch of great people and continur on nofap!!  




 God, I'm sorry. I suggest you stick with nofap and I don't mean to sound to forward, but maybe also see a therapist? Just to help you through. Of course it your choice, good luck on your journey. I can't just say this but try and trust people, I don't kniw how you feel but try, you might just meet someone you like. Good luck. 




 Let's nit, I hate heat! 




 If I go outside at that time I'd probably freeze :D 




 Ha, ha I'm sure it could.

**Edit** I just noticed I started every sentence with ha, ha. 




 Sure, I love writing. 




 Ha, ha Scotland is hardly exotic, if anything it's the opposite. It always rains here and it's cold 99% of the time. 




 [Sia: Fire meet Gasoline](https://m.youtube.com/?#/watch?v=fNdeLSKSZ1M) 




 Ha, ha it's 9.20am here. (Scotland) 




 That's too bad. Hopefully you can help her get through it.  














 Oh my god! You're right! 




 Ha, ha advantage!? 




 Good luck with it, I hate eye pain. 




 I've been meaning to learn for a long time so I finally did it and they were surprisingly good. 




 Aaaaw ouch. Heal soon OP 




 Well America and Russia are constantly arguing over who is hotter, North Korea is a weird goth who just wants to be on her own but is constantly making idle threats for attention. Japan is kinda cute, she's creative. France has an "amazing accent" all of the girls LOVE him! Scotland is ginger, but pretty awesome. Norway is cool they are pretty unique. I think china is a bit of a bully but a lot of people like her. 

England is a snooty bitch. Ireland is awesome, she believes in a lot of oretty cool things. Wales has a funny sense of humour. Spain and italy are absolutely beautiful! Greece is a history nerd but he's very cultured. Mexico gets bullied a bit by America but it's not so bad and he's pretty badass. Canda is cold but beautiful. She's distant but when you get to kniw her she's pretty great. Australia can cook! But his parents always give him into trouble for swearing and violence.   




 Finally learned how to cook pancakes. 




 So here is what I wrote in the original post

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

When I was a kid my family and I moved to the countryside. For the first four years we lived in a small town which was fine but we eventually moved, quite litterally to the middle of nowhere. It was this one street town with like 4 houses. It was ok because I spent most of my time indoors anyway (I've always been indoors-ey). The house we were living in was big, much bigger than anything I had ever stayed in before (before we moved to the countryside we lived in a suburban area of a city with a pretty big home, then a small town, then the middle of nowhere). Most of the bedrooms were upstairs but there was one down stairs. Everytime you went in it it was cold, when I say cold I mean it felt like ice, you could always see your breath. So, as a rule, I stayed out of there. The rest of the house was awesome and my brothers and sisters and I had a pretty cool time living there but I started getting horrible feelings whenever I went near the cold room: My eyes would water like I was going to cry, I would get a sore chest. I always tried to keep myself calm by explaining to myself that it was just me, I got a sore chest because of my asthma, I had watery eyes because of some other reason I'm sure I found less than convincing. The part that gets creepy was when our kitchen was being remodeled. Because of the layout of the kitchen we had to move the fridge into the cold bedroom untill the remodelling was finished. I couldn't stand going in there and eventually I straight out refused. You see I spend a lot of time with my two dogs (who were younger at the time) since I'm almost always inside and whenever they went near that room they would show their teeth and raise their hackles, which they virtually never do. One night I fell asleep and had this nightmare. In it I went into the room to get something as fast as I possibly could but then the door slammed shut and I couldn't open it for the life of me. On the other side my brother was trying to force it open. Then this man appeared he was clothed in a huge black cloak and started mumbling words I couldn't make out before he started choking me. I woke up coughing like mad and had, what I call, a "mini" asthma attack. I told my mum the next morning and she starred as if looking through me not at me. Then she said: 'XboxG4mer I had the exact same dream' She never wanted to freak me out so straight away she comforted me by telling me it was just a dream. I kept having the same nightmare and I never asked her but I think my mum did too because after a couple of months we moved away. The man in the dream was old but looked wholly evil. I don't know what happened in that house but there was something about that room. Nothing could warm it and the eery sensations I got when near it were stronger than any I've ever felt.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

UPDATE:



So I spoke with my mum about the house. She said she felt the same (she has gone through quite a lot as far as paranormal sightings go) by that I mean she has seen her fair shair of... whatever you want to call them. She said in her dream it was her being choked and she woke up in a state of sleep paralysis. When she managed to get back to sleep she had the dream again but this time I was in the room and she was trying to get in. 

The house was built around one hundred years ago. The village used to be pretty popular, it had a mining tunnel, a school, a bar, train station and more but when we lived there it was dead.

I should also mention that it was pretty foggy in my mums mind. When I brought it up she remembered it but it was lime she hadn't thought about it in a long time. 




 I intend too 




 I'm not ready, I don't have anyone I care enough about and I'm still too young in my opinion. 




 I have it on in the background, I like St Andrews, I live around an hour from there (I have family there) so it's kinda cool to see it on tv. As far as the game goes I don't mind who wins I just like the way they're playing (I'm not  biggest golf fan). 




 Ha, ha I normally hate cat videos but I liked this very much. 




 You're right, they don't deserve mercy!! 




 I used to do it all the time as a child and a few months ago I tried for a couple of weeks but eventually gave up. Yesterday I said I want to LD so I started doing reality checks throughout the day (yesterday) (I remembered all of the research I had done previously) and vola! Last night I had an LD!! 




 Awesome, good that you're starting this. Sorry about all of the crap you've went through in the last year. Nofap is a nice thing because it helps motivate but make sure to take initiative and make things happen for yourself. As far as hair loss goes I can't really help I fortunately have long hair but I've read that it helps a lot of people. Good luck!! 




 I was surprised myself that it lasted so long, I hear they tend to be really short. I wonder why it lasted so long? I'll try that during my next LD. Thank you. 




 No, it has to have impact. 




 Nofap is what you need, if you know you have these issues then 90 days should be your goal, then 120, then stopping all together (don't fap at 90 then 120, just set goals, daily goals. Like I won't fap today, one day at a time). 




 Jesus Christ I hope this isn't a real thing.
