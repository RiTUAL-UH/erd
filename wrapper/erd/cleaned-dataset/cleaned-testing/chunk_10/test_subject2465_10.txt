 Thats even worse. 




 disrespect isn't trivial  




 Yuuuuuuup.  




 Maybe Bronson should learn to watch what he says.  









 What AB did was immature, lame, and unnecessary. 

See how that works? 




 She's talented. But unstable, i'll concede.  




 If you seriously think GFK would have killed him, rap music isn't for you.  




   Why would he respond any other way than to just say sorry and get on living his awesome life? Why would he further antagonize an old ass dude who is clearly a hothead and is/was involved in very real crimes and likely murders?

GFK called him to clear up the situation, and AB posted some half-assed tweets ...then deleted them.

That was the last straw for GFK. 

AB brought it on himself. Many years ago, even saying what AB said would get hands laid on you. Not saying I disagree, but this is VERY serious. This is how GFK eats. GFK basically made it possible for people to even listen to AB's music. 

AB should have known he was playing with fire and he chose to pretend like he could boss up in front of the cameras and it didnt work. 

If AB was really about that life, he wouldn't have apologized.  




 I really want to call you an out of touch white boy who wouldn't last a day in the real jungle, but I won't do that so i'll get back to studying for my boards and making more than you and 99% of the nation's population.

But hey, whatever you need to remind yourself that you think you're "above petty rap beef" when in reality, you're a sheltered clown with no sense of cultural perspective or appreciation instead of trying to gain some sense of masculinity from a genre of music you innately have no connection to. You're a vulture and I can tell you're struggling to come up with a riposte. 

You wouldn't tell me to "go die" in my face, so get real.  




 I call it cultural tourism. They enjoy hardcore music but can't imagine the source of some of the pain and anger that produces these songs they can merely induldge in recreationally. 

GFK and the rest of the Wu are some of the most certified guys in the history of musical entertainment...we're talking FBI files and all of that. 

And for AB to even think the SLIGHTEST degree of disrespect would go un-noticed lets us know that we've gotten to a point where people think they can disrespect LEGENDS in the game 




 Because its the old way? No.

Its merely the RIGHT way. I don't care if rappers get along. I enjoy it...but don't pretend like everything is supposed to slide off your back and go unchecked. Some things you say has consequences and you need to be prepared to deal with it. 

But if you want to call it a "little jab" then you must understand how disrespectfully it will be received. 

Its telling that you don't think AB should have kept his mouth shut anyways. But no, its GFKs fault for putting AB in his place. 




 He did an album with Adrian Younge too. Two of them. Both have been well received.

Again, you don't know anything about the culture, or rap music in general.

 




 I have a masters degree and about to start school for a professional degree.

This is reddit...not my work office.

So yea, i'll talk to you anyway I please while you type away in your freshman dorm.

This culture is bigger than what some disrespectful out of touch home-body has to think

Go bump that Iggy and share it with Fantano  




 GFK treated AB like the child he was.

GFK is very sensitive to these things and AB should have accepted thats how things were gonna be since he wants to be a rapper.

Dudes were coming at Shyne and Gorilla Black for saying that they were biters. If you're going to come in the game sounding like someone else, you've got to understand how the dynamics are going to work against you 









 Respect the legends.

Go do the knowledge or fall back.

We don't respect your kind in this culture.  




 AB is so in the right...that he apologized profusely and begged forgiveness.


LMAO.

Only on reddit.  




 you're on HHH but don't understand the importance of respect in the culture.

Go home w...boy. 
 




 if you really thought GFK would kill AB you're an idiot.  




 Whats funny is how AB never gets criticized for even opening his mouth. The fact he apologized so profusely shows how right GFK was 




 Bronson is 31. He hasn't learned to shut his mouth?  




  It wasn't until The Eminem Show came out that i really grew to love hip hop.

On reddit, i'm not surprised.  




 The fact you made this theory shows you don't get it.

Bronson violated and apologized. Reneged. Got called out. then RE-apologized.

He KNOWS he was in the wrong  




 Ghost face released 2 critically acclaimed albums this year.

Go crawl back into your cul-de-sac

AB shouldn't have opened his mouth talking slick. Now he's crying about it on twitter. Suck it up. Be a man and stand behind your words.

The fact AB apologized ruins ANYTHING you're saying.  




 He responded in the same vein AB did.

I have no problem with what Ghostface said. He even CALLED the man and AB didn't back down.

AB shouldn't have opened his mouth. Where do you live in which there are no consequences?

 




 AB was acting like a bitch when he decided to throw shots at the man that allows him to feed his children 




 You're on /r/outoftheloop...you sure you want to be here? 




 The entire WU has FBI files on the entire group's members.

You children really think its sweet out here on the street 




 Too bad.

AB's behavior after that also predicated this in deleting the apology he posted up 




 Your theory is ass.

GFK ain't messing with AB and to think this could be publicity shows you don't understand how respect works.
 




 You're on /r/hiphopheads and really don't understand the subtlety of language now? 

Really?

Is that the game we're playing?  




 Oh ok. 

Just remember that people who really live that life won't tolerate some culture tourist "making jokes" 




 Too bad. 

 




 AB wasn't telling jokes. He was coming at the entire livelihood of another man who is single-handedly responsible for your career.

if AB didn't sound like GFK's legendary career AB would be flipping burgers 




 And lets be frank, the culture gap too

A lot of these kids really don't understand RESPECT 




 Funny how AB doesn't get the same criticism for talking crazy about the one man who made you famous 




 It was not. It was totally said in a disrespectful and dismissive way. 




 They love the cultural tourism of rap music but can't stomach the complications of accepting how REAL some of it is 




 no, just sheltered white kids

they love the tourism of violent music but can't embody the risks associated with it 




 GFK is in no way obligated to accept it 




 AB is on twitter legit crying right now too. 

"they sent death threats...no!"

 




 So why can't AB grow up?

Ya'll are too used to talking crazy and dodging consequences. 

This new generation needed to be reminded how respect works 




 You shouldn't use some of those words. You're clearly not even black. 




 ...which is all GFK was trying to do 




 Reddit? 




 LETS GOOOOOOO!!! 




 Yeah..."certain" posters online keep reminding you how "out of touch" they are with this "element" 




 Reddit kinda has this subtle way of reminding you how white and out of touch they are.  




 Seems like you live in a world in which disrespect is tolerated.  




 Good. 




 you nerds online really keep thinking rap is some violent business.  




 GFK gave AB MANY...MANY chances 




 I'm ABSOLUTELY supporting what GFK is doing.

You can't keep letting disrespect slide. Before you know it, history is getting rewritten 









 This is hard 









 ...if he even knows any 




 I guess you prefer the Death Metal at the masquerade?  




 Because no one invests in heavy rail 




 How brave. Does that sarcasm serve you well in real life? Where people usually ignore you? 




 You can only push back on poor communities for so long...they can't go to the outskirts any more 









 He has 18 months. Chill out 




 what happens when you mess up? 




 its really not that complicated.

She's not going to start ramping things up until things get more serious.

Is a year and a half to go 




 only 2 days smh 














 I thought BMW was a pretty well engineered brand.. 




 theres a few links in the article  




 **GERONIMO! KIA!** 




 I thought McCain snitched on his fellow soldiers 









 The Saudis are trying to save face now... 



















 The truest vein of that Dungeon Family connection 




 Many charts are now incorporating plays and spins a la spotify etc.  




 its a 2 minute video... 
























 WOW. Just. WOW 




 This album is INCREDIBLE.

He exceeded any expectation I had 







































 Eh...kinda it did.

Cuba being so close to the US has been hindered immensely. Its harder to work on the other side of the earth 




 The funny thing is that when Israel bombed Syria's nuclear facility, Syria apparently just took a few years off then tried to start up again allegedly  http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/evidence-points-to-syria-still-working-on-a-nuclear-weapon-a-1012209.html 




 I'm loving it. 









 Dont forget Iran and Azerbaijan

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Azerbaijan

 




 confirmation helps 




 This is why Iran can't get a nuke... 




 A Q Khan should be sentenced to death 




 This is incredible. I just watched the Black Ops episode on this whole affair and it looks that Syria in the midst of everything is STILL building a nuke  




 Great. Now the Saudis want  a nuke 









 Nah, reddit says its not a race issue 














 Germany 20 years ago was a vassal state of communist racists.

Try again 




 they're building and importing bomb parts
 




 REALPOLITIK  




 ALSO, its funny that when Assad found out that Suleiman had stolen like $80m, he got pissed and tried to found out how he got that corrupt 




 The Dubai assassination needs to be made into a movie 









 Sounds like you don't know anything about what Future is trying to do.

The streets will eat this up 




 wait what? 














 Streets are definitely empty in the summer 




 The only reason people live here 




 Time to invest in terrorism stocks! 














 One line? In the whole verse?

Thats essentially a fail.  




 I'm guessing you really don't get it, huh?

Its about that innate swagger and a sense of self respect and honor in the black community.

Its about being a classic, refined, reformed, eloquent gentleman. 

 




 ...that would mean he's not versatile... 




 he doesn't.

Its still too wordy.

he doesn't play with it as much as he should. 

Look at Jay Z features for example...compared to...Nas.  









 Who do you think created those single family homes and high unemployment?

Red-lining and Jim Crowe was happening when your parents were kids. That doesn't just disappear. 

Native Americans got reparations...guess who didn't.  




 As a black redditor I sometimes just give up and log off...I can't correct every 16 year old on the internet.  




 The white supremacists woke up I see 




 completely disagree 









 He's over-rapping. Every verse is the same stylistically...and frankly its fatiguing.  




 ...its really not this serious 




 ...its really not this serious 














 Crimea is nice all year round 














 its almost the type of argument a theist would make 




 I guess you also forgot where he DID try to do that initially. and still advocates for it now. 




 You white, breh?  




 the original was better. Kendrick doesn't know how to finesse features. Its really annoying.  




 Kendrick is terrible at doing features.  









 I want to remind people that party affiliation DOES matter.

No republican president would have ever done this 




 Obama with Senioritis really is the GOAT 




 Stuff seems to be burning: https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/621389094011146240 




 Funded by BP 




 WOW 




 you can't just post a number a cut it 




  Oh, I forgot. Obama never even attempts to "fix" BIG issues like income inequality, he pecks at the edges because doing something bold just isn't on his agenda of "change".

you're just babbling, huh? 

 
























 fascinating.  














 we really had no choice. 

Everyone has tried to sabotage every iranian nuclear plant using the most advanced computer viruses ever and kill as many scientists working on the plan as possible...AND used some of the most stringent economic sanctions to any planet ever. 

And they've kept going 



















 He's right. Its the best we could do. 

Iran will probably have a nuke, but we have to try because theres no other option but war.  









 Fascism applies to internal politics.

And furthermore, I really don't care what you're trying to convince me of.

I support things that the US benefits from. We aren't helped with an arms race in the middle east 









 Its not facist and you can't keep using a word you clearly are misunderstood on what it means 









 Its not racism to hold your own nation's values over anyone else.  







































 I don't respect what any other nation thinks they want to do if it violates what we want them to do 

Its how hegemony works. 

You call it selfish, I call it maintaining power.  




 He can't do anything about it. Its either make a "deal" or kill millions of Iranians.  




 Iran is going to be the next Pakistan 














 sniffer?
