 Hey there readers!

I just read a great book and would love to email the author some questions. Even if its ignored... Is this possible?

I would want to contact Ron Chernow, author of Titan.

Thank you in advance, I appreciate all the answers :) 




 Wish I had a business. Otherwise I would. Good luck :) 




 Wow that's a very interesting business model you've got there! 




 LOL a good friend of mine is the daughter of the founder :p 




 What is the best alternative then? (If no coder friends or acquaintances are available). 




 I may be wrong. Unlike water,  bandwidth has a very large and beneficial use to society, a merit good with a large positive externality - unlike water (I am aware we need water to survive). The benefits vary from providing education, training,  entertainment, political accountability (at least in democratic nations), healthcare, increases long-run aggregate supply, allows for more perfect knowledge etc. Examples abound. Therefore, bandwidth, internet and similar other goods and services (such as Wikipedia), ought to be provided for free as their benefits far outweigh the costs. 




 Sorry I meant, others had so much hate on you. Very interesting article too. So what would you suggest retail investors do? 




 I feel like your having so much hate for no reason. What would one, in your opinion, do then? Should this prevent one from investing in Google? Are there other companies you could name that you feel have similar issues? 




 All the money raised by start-ups / number of people in country. A proxy to see how easy it is to gain capital (and thus how easy to succeed) in a given European country. 




 It is very expensive, your right. But I really do not understand why the perif is such a large chasm. Living in Paris it just seems like a large road. I woudknt understand how the prices of real estate in one side could be markedly higher than on the other. 




 I'm Parisian too and didn't know that. I thought it was a clear east v west divide 




 Permanently keep the Olympics would have numerous benefits to all parties currently involved in the negotiations. But what would it provide to the IOC? I fear that dictators are more lucrative.

 Thought you could  




 How would you re-negotiate? 









 I may be ignorant/wrong but I believe in my humble opinion that finance/accounting/bookkeeping is the only real tangible thing one can learn to prepare for business - everything else being learnt through experience. I also believe it is the bedrock of all other departments (marketing, hr, production) and that by learning it first it would help in the long run (not that I didn't learn about marketing either). 




 Hey!
I am a pre-university (IB) student 17 years old) living in Paris. I would want to apply to UCL, LSE and/or Oxford and I would want to have some work experience. I already am doing a 3 week internship this summer, as well as read up on a lot of material. Just as John D. Rockefeller began almost two hundred years ago, finance and numbers is something that I appreciate and having some bookkeeper experience is something I will value greatly. I understand that I would only be of limited use, but I would love it if you could give me a chance.

Here are reasons why I may interest any of you:

I do not require any pay at all

I have free time

I consider myself very knowledgeable (albeit inexperienced) for my age*

I have a good grasp on Microsoft Excel, Access and other software

I have satisfactory grades: 
near perfect IGCSEs (including ICT HL, Business HL and maths HL)
40 in IB (according to latest report) (including Math SL and Economics HL)

I am willing and able to provide more information as well as evidence that I actually can/did these things.

I would want to participate in accounting, finance, etc. for any of your firms. PM me for further details if you wish so.
I hope I am not sounding too pretentious or arrogant, I am just excited at the prospect of working with entrepreneurs, craving to be one one day. 

PS. I will only work for an actual start-up and/or SME. It will have to be online as I am not able to move away from Paris.

*I have already began investing in the stock market after reading both the II and SA, as well as 'Titan: Rockefeller' and many other books; I have pursued small entrepreneurial ventures and have already worked in a couple of events organising several things. However, I overall lack the experience that you may require of me, and I am willing to compensate by working hard and learning fast, without pay.

 And they are running out of time 




 A very utopian and unrealistic idea, but what about: a nation where a majority of people are shareholders of companies that use robots. Incomes of most people would derive from capital gains and dividends, whilst a minority gain their income from managerial roles (CEOs, politicians, non-profits, military, etc). I've thought about it, but being 17, I would love to have this idea challenged. 




 Will soon be 29 states :p 




 I just hope European companies actually try to increase efficiency instead of relying too much on subsidies. I would want to see European spacex's instead of ariane's. 




 Thanks for the response :D
Why do you think fiscal policy would not work/be effective? 














 Hey r/economy! My first post. 
You all probably know a lot about this topic, so lets discuss! Mini-essays, links or discussions would be much more interesting than simple responses - but I wish this thread interests everyone.

Discuss! 




 Strange :D 




 Lad :D

How did he do? 




 Thank you for the answer :) is there anything I should tell them specifically? Its a tiny snack sandwhich shop, so I doubt they got annual reports :D 




 Thanks for the answer :) Any tips or advice on how to frame the question? I guess I would want help in the details.
