 Night Film by Marissa Pessl is a must read. Well, specifically if you are also a fan of cinema.  




 Yes, I knew 48 hours before pir 




 For some reason scenes from "The Painter" by Peter Heller always come to my mind. I'll be driving or something and I'll just think back on this book. I've read dozens of books after it, most were more memorable, yet I still think back on it. It's a good book, don't get me wrong but it shouldn't have stuck with me. 


How bout yall? 









 I feel that it will be an extremely lose adaption. Especially if they're going for a trilogy. 




 2040 looks right too me 




 I really wanted to be a Loadmaster :(  




 Nice link. Sister just started a PR internship, shed read this. 




 If you're in it for a high salary, military ain't the right place. Look at officers salaries, they aren't that competitive to real world STEM jobs. Plus, dont you basically need a STEM degree to get commissioned? 




 Doesn't look even close to worth it. 




 I think its an editing joke 




 Doesn't even matter. The more people that watch Chappelles stand up, the better the world will be  




 Nice post yo. 




 Its a horror film 




 Its about Sofia Vergara and Reese Witherspoon competing to see who could be the most annoying. 




 Winter Soldier is better, in my opinion at least. GotG had a really really shitty villain. Sure, the buildup was great, but the point of there union was shitty. Who was even the villain? I dont remember. 




 I cant decide between them two 




 I own this and I love it 




 Season 2 needs to happen already 




 It is too weird. I dont see it connecting with most people.  




 Thanks everyone, just gonna study at the hotel and airplane ride. 




 Im going in E3 so yea, ill just learn the orders. 




 How about ranks? Is it really necessary to memorize those before going in? I think I know the sailor creed already, DEP meeting singing put it in my mind. 




 Haven't opened my START book because I would rather just learn all of it at Great Lakes. Am I right in thinking that I can go unprepared and still succeed? I mean, I'll study on the plane I guess. Just don't want to spend my last days as a civilian studying. 




 My prediction: opening dom $35 million 

final $105 million

international i have no idea 




 Sounds like she has mental problems. Hopefully she gets help 




 Yea I was really really wrong 




 You might as well mention it. I luckily had a doctor perform a pulmonary function test on me a couple years ago that I passed perfectly, so I just had to bring that proof in, but I'm all good. 




 This is some saiyan shit. Come to the brink of death, survive, find yourself more powerful than ever before. 




 The movie cant be seen live, but the fight is better if watched live. makes sense that many took a gamble on it. 




 I loved it.  




 I cant decide between Sirens of Titan and Cats Cradle 




 There were also a lot of college graduations going on. This was an eventful weekend. I missed the fight and the clippers game just to watch Avengers. My priorities are different lol 




 I say you're correct. $135 mill opening with only 30% drop 




 That guy must be so happy he supported his wife's hobby  




 Why don't you just ask daddy to buy you some money? 




 Anectodal evidence of course, but I left my theater today at around 12:30 am and streets were empty. I hung out at my friends house for a bit and on the way home there was a lot more cars, around 2 am, so a lot of people were watching this fight. Movie was awesome btw. The reviews made me lower my expectations, and I wasn't blown away, but it was a great 2.5 hours. Better than furious 7 




 So should movies just have blank spaces in spots where brands would normally appear? Honestly how is complaining about product placement still a thing. I hold a Nokia phone in my hand and Scott toilet paper behind me. If I was in a film these would be visibly present, yet not integral to the storyline. They're just there. Dont worry about it. 




 OP listen to this. 

Also OP, do you qualify for a Top Secret clearance? 




 My predicitons are pretty close to yours. Good analysis.

Only three I would change, Minions, Ted and Inside Out. I think you overestimate Minions and Inside Out. Ted 2 I can see hitting $200. 

And yea, Mad Max is gonna crawl to $100 slower than Edge of Tomorrow.   




 I regret not going immediately after high school.

Questions: Can you afford college?

Do you care if you arent an officer?

How bad do you want to leave your current hometown?

What job would you like in the military?

What degree would you persue in college?

Do you know about the GI Bill? 




 America post cynicism  




 That novel is literary vacation. 




 The Stand by Stephen King is similar in that it deals with multiple parts of an apocalypse. 




 So about the same as the first one. Yall that were saying $300 mil were fucking crazy 




 Yea ill ask there thank you. I usually frequent those subreddits anyways. 




 If its good: Yay!


If its bad: I dont care!


Book will always be the same. A great short thrill to read  




 Honestly feel like cancelling on my friend :/ we were gonna watch Avengers 2 sat before the fight. Now I have a game 7 to watch 

what to ddooooo 




 I'd settle for just being a billionaire honestly 




 That  southern lovin 




 I wish I was him. 




 Watch WrestleMania. It was great 




 Going to Navy bootcamp in May, and I want Bernie as my future president. Last election I wasnt much involved but I feel like it will be necessary this time. I will most likely not be stationed in my home state of Florida, so I will be a mail in. Do primaries allow mail in? Am I even allowed to participate in a campaign while on active duty? 

Thank you 




 Ive read three from King, got a couple of his i still want to read. Adding it 




 Whats there to catch up on? The good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. 




 theres a new star wars?!!?!? 




 I was soooo wrong on this one. It looked like a bomb to me. Second trailers did help a lot. 




 My advice, talk to a recruiter as soon as possible. I signed my contract seven months ago and I still have a couple weeks left to ship. Its a process. 




 I've had that on my list for a while 




 That sounds interesting, title? 




 La Sombra del Viento has me in mid 20 century Spain.

Blood Meridian has me in mid 19th century Tex/Mex.

I would much rather be in Spain though.

So, where do your books have you? Space? A labyrinth?

Why's no one posting titles?  




 I say $210 million. Those presales are surprising me.
