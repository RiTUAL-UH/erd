 They remind me a lot of those from the Afghan Girl picture from National Geographic

 I love paper airplane and it's the coolest thing but I honestly find it super rude when people throw them while there are people on stage taking. It's like I wanna go apologize for them. 




 When guys make derogatory or negative comments about a girl's appearance. If he's talking to his buddies about how fat Lisa is and how far apart Hannah's eyes are, then I don't want to know what he's saying about me. 




 I have to stay up late tonight so talk to me!

 Congrats! Your video low key made me cry. You guys deserved it! 




 That just made my morning. 




 Because they're in AP chem. That would be why they mentioned the AP. 




 On our last test on buffers and ka and kb I got a whopping 48% 














 This song is so beautiful. I was about to post it myself. 




 Damn this is a great song. The "you're just jealous cuz we're young and in love" part still gives me chills. Does anybody know if Brand New has made any statements about recording new music? 




 Mom I didn't fail that math test, I was hacked 




 For sure. Life goals. 




 I've never heard that! My eyes and nose do kinda look like hers but my jawline is nothing like hers. Our first and last names are very similar though. Maybe she's a future me.

I like to describe myself as chunky, yet funky. 




 Idk how much your school prepared you, but for the reading section, DO NOT DO THE FIRST PASSAGE FIRST. It's always prose fiction which is the hardest. Pick any of the other 3 to do first. We were also taught that in the science section, if two of the answers are complete opposites, then one of them is the right answer. 




 ME TOO AND ITS SO WEIRD AND IM NOT PROUD OF IT. I was just talking about this today. I was telling my friend how I could have the most basic information and in 30 minutes I could know your life story and your mother's best friend's cousin's cat's date of birth. This isn't a thing I tell people IRL.

 Dark Waves - I Don't Wanna Be In Love 




 Yaaaas 




 THIS POST ACTUALLY JUST MADE MY DAY A LITTLE BETTER I LOVE HIM SO MUCH 




 I get green tea frapuccinos all year   




 Lol. It's not. They were references to the reading portions of the PSAT. They had an section comparing training kids to training dolphins, and a section about this guy who went to the Grand Canyon but not really. So yeah, not just random babbling. Lol. 




 I'm an indie and alternative rock girl, and although I usually don't admit it, I also know how to rock out to Kanye, Childish Gambino, Kendrick Lamar, and Frank Ocean.

I'm a very shy and quiet person, but in my first hour Spanish class, I talk a lot and make a lot of jokes, even though I don't have any friends in that class. No idea why I'm so comfortable in that class. Maybe it's the teacher.

I'm a band student, and most students have that "band kids are great we stick together" mentality, but I think a lot of band kids are really annoying and have huge egos and are sort of douche bags. 




 Oh yeah. 




 That's not really a thing to joke about.... Just saying. 




 Well. Gerbil died this week, my final grade in AP chem is going to be a C+, which is the first grade below a B- that I've ever gotten, my other gerbil is obviously sick, and I've got myself down about a boy. Hopefully next week will be better.

But I made up with one of my friends who I was mad at so that's nice I suppose  




 Kind of. Loved this dude to no end, then we broke up. And he straight up told me he doesn't like me as more than a friend anymore after about a year of us still having feelings after we broke up. Now he's talking to me less and less and obviously trying to get away from me and it breaks my heart because I can feel him slipping away and I can't handle that. As melodramatic as it sounds I've been flirting a lot with other guys lately, because I figure that if I give myself to guys that don't matter then I'll forget the only one that does. My friends hate him, his friends hate me. We fought a lot and at one point this summer he was being such a dick to me that I told him I was done and I wasn't gonna talk to him anymore. That lasted about a week. Then I smoked weed once in like, September after I promised him I wouldn't (he's really against drugs and alcohol), and then texted him high off my ass. Basically after a spell of us being really good with each other, I broke it and he said "I broke the best bond we've ever had with each other." Then he ran off and his friends found him at the smoke shop because "if she's gonna stoop that low then so am I." And nothing has been the same since then. I love this guy to no end, he's the only thing I ever think about, and he's pushing me away, and I think about it and it just makes my entire body hurt because I know it's completely over and won't happen again. Sorry for the wall of text, but I started typing and it felt good to let it out. 




 Well I'm currently listening to Some Nights by Fun.
But the last full song to grace my ears was Sunburn by Ed Sheeran 




 Our lead mentor has this really cool alternative playlist that he sometimes plays during build season but half the team complains about it so they're been saying Uptown Funk nonstop. I wish I was joking when I told you that they played it on a loop for 7 hours yesterday.

 Earthbound. Because I think it's revolutionary in that it's supposed to be a kids game but the underlying themes are so dark and it's just such a beautiful game in general. Also it's fun af.

 Well. The college admissions people for the school that I emailed (and really want to go to) we're rude as hell to me. My friend that I kinda have feelings for didn't text me back all day. My other friend who always asks for nudes and who I always say no to because I don't do that decided that he doesn't want to be my friend if I won't send him nudes. So, it was a day. But at least I aced my Spanish test. That was cool.

 July 3rd woo 




 I have teachers that tell us how great we are and then bitch about us to other classes and vice versa. So that's fun. 




 My best friend got me into Achievement Hunter so that's been my day. 




 That's a really stupid thing to say actually. But yeah my phone is white. 




 She probably misses you. I'm guilty of the same thing and didn't have any ulterior motives. You've probably just been on her mind. 




 God dammit I've had this calling to California for the past year, this is making it even worse ;-; No but really that's a great picture and super super cool

 Hey, congrats on the school of engineering at U of M! That's a hard program to get into

 "You'll find more and more peace with Dad, and you won't always cry every night about it. It will get easier. About 2 years from now you'll accidentally come across a boy who breaks your heart over and over again and you still care about him. He cycle started because you were the first to let him go. Don't do that. It will be tough, but stick with him because he's worth it. Stay motivated in school, because in 3 years you'll be in your AP classes regretting the times you could barely pass 8th grade math because you were lazy. Just look to the future and keep your goals in mind. Tell Mom you love her. Hang in there. It gets easier."

 I live in Michigan, which is a state that requires the ACT, and very few people take the SAT. I'm trying really hard to get into UMich, and I'm wondering if taking the SAT would look good, and if it would make it seem like I'm motivated and diligent. To take the SAT here, it costs money and isn't required or even necessarily encouraged at my school, so I assume that most of the applicants only take the ACT. Would it be to my advantage to take both, or is it more trouble than it's worth? 




 No problem! I bet she does too! :) 




 You could have just told her "no I don't want to talk to you." If my ex did that to me i would cry for hours tbh. Reading the backstory, there is no way in the world she falls under the category of "whore." You were just a clingy jerk tbqh.  




 THATS ACTUALLY SO CUTE AW 




 Think of if this way: if a guy did the exact same thing, no one would bat an eye. I wouldn't do that personally but as long as you're not hurting yourself or anyone else in doing it, then you're okay. 




 Thanks dude! 




 Officially hit the "30 pounds less fat" mark B)
