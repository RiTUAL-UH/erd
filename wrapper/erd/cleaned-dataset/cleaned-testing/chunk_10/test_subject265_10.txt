 But they're absolutely necessary. Death is permanent so it's damn important that we get it right.  




 I thought that it was confirmed that Otis Toole killed him

The official conclusion is that Toole killed him. 

Plus Dahmer made a full confession, why else would he admit to the 1978 murder of Steven Hicks when he could have gotten away with, why admit that but leave Adam Walsh out? 

Also, Dahmer was obsessed with heads and skulls, discarding the head is not like him. Neither is preying on children. I've read about this theory more than a dozen times. I don't think it's likely. 

 




 What's wrong about it? It's tissue that would otherwise be destroyed. There's no rational argument for not using it for the advancement of scientific medical knowledge and the good of mankind. 

You don't speak for everyone.  




 Hence the quotation marks.  




 That's what I was thinking. What's the difference between this and brass knuckles? The summary in the link described it as "nonlethal".  




 Nah. This kind of stuff can happen almost anywhere. I wouldn't be surprised to have read that this happened in Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Mississippi, Florida, Virginia, California, Utah, or any other state really.  




 Yeah, I tried again. Still got a paywall. 

Edit: It's also worth noting that this article is more than two years old.  




 I wonder what kind of resolution the device offers.  




 This is horrible manners in Japan too.  




 Any idea about the legal status of such devices?  




 I don't care about reposts* so much, but it's obnoxious when people repost and try to make up some crummy story to claim ownership.  




 So she's incompetent because you disagree with her?  




 Paywall  




 Thanks for clarifying. Have a nice life.  




 I was in the Navy so I'm well acquainted with that testing. Though I wouldn't suggest risking it, I'm not convinced that they test for [Psilocin unless it's indicated.] (https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_testing.shtml) 




 There are plenty of employment positions where drug testing is non-negotiable. The supervisor may not have a say at all. But I seriously doubt that they're actively testing for Psilocybin or any of its metabolites.  




 I don't know. It's unfortunate that the parents have had to suffer through all of this. But that photo presents a solid warning about the consequences of reckless driving.  




 You called me an "avowed, violent homophobe". I'm none of these things, and certainly not "avowed" 

You were arguing that people of color are more likely to commit crimes because of their race. 

I didn't say you were a nazi. I said that you would support interning and deporting foreigners, and would most likely borrow a page from Hitler's book. I'm not wrong. You obviously believe that Africans are inferior human beings. One only has to flip through your comment history to see that. If you don't like being associated with hateful organizations, stop spreading hateful rhetoric and ideas.  




 Overly dramatic? Maybe. Incompetent? On what basis do you claim that she's incompetent?  




 Too bad this is a repost.  




 That picture is terrible and the text is unreadable.  




 Boone's Farm is not wine.  




 No, their job does not test for mushrooms.  




 I'll take her over either of those two Republicans.  




 [This is the image in question. (NSFW)] (http://imgur.com/7kV4hmd) 

[Here is a picture of her. ] (http://imgur.com/Ih3Ji1o)  




 Apparently you didn't read my comment. She was already a senator. She was the incumbent. She beat both Talent and Akin fair and square.  




 Doesn't look like it's any bigger than a mosquito to me.  




 Of course drinking and driving is wrong and there should be penalties for breaking this law. But most of the country is either rural or suburban. There's no question that people all over the place are either pushing the legal boundaries or breaking the law because it's either terribly inconvenient or even impossible for them to go out without driving themselves. I'm not defending their actions. I'm merely explaining the problem. Until we acknowledge that there is a problem, we cannot address it, let alone solve it. 

If we as a nation committed to building mass transportation infrastructure, we could solve this problem and many more.  




 Are you calling me a homophobe? 

You're calling me a "violent homophobe"? Are you for real?  




 When employees don't earn enough from their labor to break even that is a form of slavery.  




 I don't disagree. But here we are in a thread discussing raising the minimum wage til our heads fall off while getting nowhere year after year. I'm completely for a basic income, but we can't even convince people that workers have a right to not live in poverty. How the hell do you expect to convince the same people that no one deserves to live in poverty, ever?  




 That doesn't make any sense.  




 What? Blagojevich isn't running for anything. He's in prison and completely unelectable.  




 The US is not an empire. It's a country. There's no reason to compare it with any of the empires that you listed. It's not like the US is an occupying force controlling multiple individual populations like those places.  




 That's not necessarily true. Obviously the powers of the executive are checked and balanced by the powers of the judicial and legislative branches, but that doesn't mean that a president cannot facilitate change or resist change.  




 Meanwhile, a third of the food that's produced in the US is thrown away or destroyed. There's absolutely no reason why anyone should go hungry in this country, especially not children.  



















 Like I said, you're a terrible person.  




 He was threatened with a 40 year sentence for $40 worth of cannabis. How does that not constitute coercion under severe distress?  




 Fucking monsters. We need to get more on this story.  




 Goddamn, you're a terrible person.  









 You're being downvoted for being wrong. Did you even read the article that you linked?  




 That's ridiculous. Yeah there were atrocities committed against the Native Americans, but otherwise there's no comparison.  









 Jesus, really? You just called me lazy for providing your sources for you? 

I was just joshing ya. You can tell that my comment was meant to be a joke (and not a personal attack) from the lack of profanity and personal insults. I was joking. No harm, no foul?  




 Make an amazingly relevant point and don't provide a source.... What's wrong with you? Did you not have five minutes to spend with Google? 

Well here it goes:

From last year: [According to a CBS News investigation, at least 12 of the top leaders of ISIS served time at Camp Bucca, including the man who would become the group's leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi.] (http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-origins-of-isis-finding-the-birthplace-of-jihad/) 

[Camp Bucca.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Bucca) 

Shame on you. Some people are dying for the opportunity to Google stuff.  




 Aww, did this repost huwt yorw feewings?  




 Is he a genius? Is that the word? Really? I mean seriously? Genius?  




 Exactly. Star Wars is a great analog for the current US economy. "Of course it didn't make you any profit, that money is mine.". 




 What's your point? And you didn't answer: which of those labels are you for not even offering anyone anything for their labor? Other employers might not be making them offers that you like, but you're not offering them anything at all. Should you really be on your high horse?

I don't assume to have the right to steal other people's time and labor, two things that have a definite value and cannot be replaced. 


What are the basic necessities of life, and why do they cost 150 times what they did 200 years ago?

Basic food, shelter, communication, and transportation. Why the fuck would we be assessing our current cost of living based upon standards that are two hundred years old? 

By what metric? Obviously not by what it takes to survive.

Survival? Can a family survive without working in this country? Please include sources and/or examples. 

I doubt that's a choice many would make. There are far better alternatives, even to people who are vastly poorer than the poorest people in our society.

Again your argument is "it could be worse. You could have been born 5,000 years ago." That makes no sense at all. It's now that I refer you to the history of the US from the late 19th century up until the end of WWII. Please explain to me why workers aren't entitled to a reasonable share of the fruits of their labor. 

Anyone who advocates a minimum wage.

Banning people from working or prohibiting employers from exploiting people? See, I believe that there is at least a baseline value to human time and effort. You feel that human beings are worthless and should be exploited at every opportunity. 

I said nothing of the sort. If you want to help them avoid living in squalor, help them become productive enough that they can convince an employer to pay them enough that they can afford better.


This is a good point. We should all have the right to convince employers that our time and effort is* worth more. I prefer the collective approach of negotiating. That's how employers negotiate wages; collectively. They collude with their competition and set wages at a baseline. What's wrong with employees doing the same thing? Why shouldn't there be a baseline to the value of human time and effort? What price do you put on your time with your children? What would you do to spend more time with them? 

Which?

You'd have to be blind to have missed it. It's the edit at the bottom of the comment. 
  




 Assuming you're not an employer, which of those are you for not even offering them *anything* in compensation for their labor?

Every company I've worked for have been wage thieves. I've worked for people who have bounced my paychecks. Now years later they still have not faced the consequences of their actions. If I bounce one check I will either pay for it or I'll go to jail. In many cases I'll go to jail whether I pay it or not. 


You can miss the point if you'd like, but it's quite obvious I'm not suggesting that. I'm asking why a 'living wage' has gone up 150 times. I can certainly understand it costs more money to live the sort of lifestyle people are accustomed to today.

A person earning minimum wage cannot afford the basic necessities of life in today's society. 

So you're willing to admit that a 'living wage' is no such thing?

Fuck no! I feel that $15 is just about right with an increase to $17 by 2020.


Maybe we should let the poor decide what type of roof they'd like to have over their heads, rather than forcing them to pay for the same quality of roof as rich people like to pay for. Or if you think they deserve better, help them pay for it. Don't ban them from working because they can't convince an employer to pay them enough to buy such a roof.

And by letting poor people decide, you mean "allow them to choose to live outdoors". Who's talking about banning anyone from working? 

There are plenty of people who survive, by choice, without electricity. Their interaction with the rest of society is limited, but they do fine. If you'd like to help people participate more thoroughly with society, or feel it's their right to do so, then help them to gain the skills they need to convince an employer to pay them enough to participate effectively in society. How does banning them from working help with that? Either way, you're no longer talking about a 'living wage'.

And there you have it. You think that people should be living in squalor and should only be able to cover their life expenses if they meet your arbitrary criteria. Again, who said anything about banning them from working? 

Why didn't you answer my questions at the end of my comment? 

 




 OP decided for their own reasons to delete their comment but allowed me to quote them:

You got it. 

Abortion was and still is the primary issue the religious right used to take over the Republican Party, using lies and deceit. The issue has always been other people's morality, and control. 

I'll delete this shortly, TMI, but there is a young woman who exists today from an unwanted and unplanned pregnancy, whom I love very much. Her parents made what IMO was the right decision. Difficult, but manageable. The extended family had the resources to make it work. 

Others don't. Poor women die from coat hanger or chemical abortions. Or they continue the cycle of poverty. No help for them from the religious right. 




Nope, there's never any actual concern. This is about personal judgement. Thanks for sharing. I'd prefer that every child conceived had the opportunity to be born into a loving and welcoming environment. In "my perfect world", no one would ever get pregnant unless they wanted to or were at least ready to handle being a parent. Every child would be born into a loving home, and not one child would go without a single basic necessity. But we all know that's not the current situation. Rather than continuing on this hateful course, we should try working together to actually address these problems. These problems are solvable, no matter what the far-right has to say.  




 If no one will offer you a job that pays for food and shelter, what you need is charity or lower prices, not to be banned from working by a minimum wage law.


Working people do not need charity. They need compensation. This is simple. Those who do, need not ask for help. They earn their keep. It's not their fault that the bosses are lazy, greedy, and treacherous. 


[It has been estimated that throughout prehistory, the world average GDP per capita was about $158 per annum (adjusted to 2013 dollars), and did not rise much until the Industrial Revolution.[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_world) That makes a 'living wage' today roughly 150 *times* the 'living wage' of 99% of all humans that have ever lived. Why the increase?


"You're absolutely correct. Americans should be living the lifestyle of the 19th century. The bosses shouldn't have to share the fruits of their workers' labor. Thats crazy talk. We should all live in huts, eat beans and rice for every meal, and be thankful for the opportunity. After all, we can't all be born into wealth. Just do what the master says, children." 


What about the federal minimum wage in 5000 BC, or 1900 AD? People were still living then, last I checked.

Bwahaha! You're right. We should all be living in mud huts. Because fuck people, amirite? 

If it costs 150 times more just to live, I would guess that expenses have increased.

Right, only the wealthiest people should have a solid roof over their heads. Who cares if it's impossible to function in today's society without electricity? Who cares if 90% of job opportunities are only available online. The internet should only be available to the most privileged. Who cares if a person needs to have clean cloths to remain employed? Laundry machines are a privilege for the wealthy. 

What about the wealthy? What are the historical numbers on them? What are the historical numbers on wealth distribution?

How does it smell with your nose wedged so far up there? 

Edit: Let me ask you something. What determines the cost of coal? Is it what the market will bear? Or is it the cost of extracting, handling, and shipping coal and then maintaining all of that overhead? 

 




 Thank you for your simple honesty. Seriously. I myself could never go through with an abortion unless my wife's life was in danger. I'm a father and I could never live with myself. But, I don't pretend to have the right to tell others what they can and cannot do with their own bodies. That attitude is just wrong. 

But you're absolutely correct. Banning abortion doesn't stop abortion. It just drives it into back alleys and into the hands of criminals. 

But the "prolife" people were never concerned with reducing abortions. Their goal is control over the personal choices of others. It's an obvious fact fhat the best way to reduce the number of abortions performed is to reduce the rate of unwanted pregnancy. The most effective method of doing that is through sex education and easy access to contraception, which those that you mentioned oppose. This was never about abortion. This "issue"  has always been about controlling the behavior and choices of women.  




 Nope. I think they were just pilots and aircrew. If we had continued our ground campaign against the Japanese the death toll would have been in the millions. 

Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not entirely convinced that the bombings or their strategic placement were entirely necessary. Though I do understand the rationale behind forcing a full surrender that included the emperor stepping down and declaring himself a mortal man. You have to remember the numbers of people who were murdered by the Japanese military **by hand**. If any one of the axis members had acquired atomic weapons technology before  the US, they would have used it without a shred of discretion.  




 Or...  This is the thing... you'll love it... 

Walmart knows that people are desperate and will work for anything they can get. They use government programs to offset their labor costs. They don't give a flying fuck about their employees, and when technologies become available for them to automate **every aspect** of their business they will. 




 Obama tried that and was blocked but if I were an illegal I would not have gone for his plan either. It is a very big humanitarian issue.  




 So simple food, shelter, transportation, and communication are too much to ask for when you work for a living? Why are expenses so much higher? What are you talking about? You understand that the federal minimum wage is well below what it was in the 1960's right? Did expenses increase or did wages stagnate and even decrease for most folks?  




 A Chicago investigator who determined that several civilian shootings by police officers were unjustified was fired after resisting orders to reverse those findings... 

See, this is the problem. A real investigator does not receive or heed orders from the subject of his investigation. This is doubly true for an "independent investigator". 

Daviss termination came less than two weeks after top IPRA officials, evaluating Daviss job performance, accused him of a clear bias against the police and called him the only supervisor at IPRA who resists making requested changes as directed by management in order to reflect the correct finding with respect to OIS, as officer-involved shootings are known in the agency.

IPRA? That's the **Independent** Police Review Authority. That's right, supervising investigator Lorenzo Davis, 65, a former Chicago police commander who served the CPD for twenty-three years was terminated because he refused to change his report so that it would be in agreement with the findings of his superiors. 

The performance evaluation covered 19 months and concluded that Davis displays a complete lack of objectivity combined with a clear bias against the police in spite of his own lengthy police career.

"How dare he question the actions of the police? And him a former officer himself, no less. Well I never!" w

Apparently city management isn't even willing to listen to objective criticisms of its police departments even when it's coming from a former officer. 

If there are a few bad police officers who have committed some shootings that are unnecessary or bad then it erodes the publics confidence in all the other police officers out there, Davis said.

Can you believe this guy? Who does he think he is attacking the police like that, an official supervising investigator charged with investigating police misconduct? How can the police do their jobs in such a hostile environment? 
 




 Jesus, that's disgusting. Thanks for the link.  




 Women, who are very rarely actual combatants have historically been the primary victims in war. It's not that difficult to understand. Men with guns invade your country, target you and your family members, rape and kill you and your loved ones. Or, your husband and reasonably mature sons are being sent away to die leaving you to fend for your family alone.  




 Yep. But I think this asshole would like to create a new one on American soil.  




 Slave level wages is an oxymoron.  

Is it? If a person works forty hours a week and their wages don't even cover their living expenses, what do you call that? When workers have to go into debt in order to keep working, what do you call that? 

The cost of living isn't tied to the minimum wage. It's likely that raising the minimum wage may cause a slight increase in inflation, but not enough to prohibit the move. Right now the economy that you're talking about is propped up by government programs and taxpayers' funds. A business that can't operate while treating it's employees with simple human dignity and adequately compensating them for their time in a way that is sustainable doesn't need to exist. This isn't the 19th century. 
 




 Both Mcdonald's and Walmart instruct their employees about what government assistance programs are available to them. This is pretty much common knowledge amongst those that are interested in politics.  




 Exactly. It's a studious Republican governor that orders the ban of something that's never once happened and is already very illegal.  



















 I don't disagree with any of what you just said. But don't hate on the president for trying. The legislature sure as hell isn't going to do a damn thing.  




 Supported or did business with? Whether you see the distinction is irrelevant. Yes those companies all did business with the third reich. It's laughable that you don't realize that this is common knowledge to those with any understanding of history. It still doesn't excuse your shitty attitude toward those who have served and fought in the military. 

Obviously it's a huge problem that corporations and states exploit any workers. But, why shit on any of them? You're no better than they. Your politics are almost admirable, but your attitude toward your fellow man is shit. 

Edit: Added a question mark.  




 The majority have not been Mexican for awhile now. I never said the law was unjust. What's unjust is this attitude that nothing can be done to accommodate those that are already here. Why should people in Detroit flee to Canada? They're already in a relatively stable developed country. The most wealthy in the world in fact.  




 I asked for mudslinging, not quiet dismissal.  




 And who was that? 

Edit: Because I think you're a bit confused. Claire McCaskill became a US senator when she defeated Republican incumbent Jim Talent in 2006. The person you're talking about, Todd Akin was the unsuccessful Republican challenger of 2012. She won the Senate seat and retained it because she was the better candidate on both instances.  




 I guess you think that all of the undocumented immigrants coming to the US are Mexican. And tell me what would you do if you found your family in that situation? Would you wait around for your sons to be recruited by gangs and your daughters turned out on the streets? Can you blame anyone for trying to escape that fate?  




 I don't disagree.  




 Yeah, that's a bullshit flag, and the mods won't respond to defend or even explain it.  




 I'm pointing out the blatant fact that War is not something to admire. And that those who lost their lives are not heroes. They are victims of state propaganda. Just like you and every other muppet who blindly buys the bollocks you're espousing.   

Try telling that to the people of Europe and Asia after WWII. Explain to them why it was a mistake for the allies to confront the Nazis, Japanese and other axis members because doing so would just be statism. I guess to you it woukd have been preferable to die or be enslaved rather than fight. Makes total sense from where you're sitting right now doesn't it? Here you are enjoying the stability and peace that was hard won by your predecessors. Of course it's very easy for you to denounce them and their sacrifices. This is the definition of self entitlement. You aren't faced with such a decision so of course it's easy for you to shit on those who were. 

What do the Iraq or Afghanistan war have to do with anything I've said other than the fact that it's a shitty attitude one must possess in order to crap on those who serve. I don't agree with either of those conflicts, but I'm sure as shit not going to blame the soldiers, airmen, sailors, or Marines that are fighting them. They don't get to choose what wars their countries engage in. You're like that guy who went to Chick-Fil-A and yelled at the cashier about the corporation's donations to anti-LGBT organizations. 

Edit:

I'm not mocking anyone you obedient donkey.

Right. 

Any veteran who preaches that "woo-hah" bollocks needs to be ridiculed for the idiot they are. 

What was that again? 



 




 I'm glad you picked up on the condescension, because I was doing it as loud as I could. 

There were only three images from the Iraq war out of twenty-four. This sub isn't for mocking and making light of the dead. Whether or not you agree with a country's policies, it's undeniable that nations need militaries in order to defend themselves. There's no reason to shit on those men and women who are drafted or volunteer to serve and sacrifice for their countries. If you want to talk about politics go to /r/politics or any other sub where that is the topic of conversation and they tolerate disrespecting the dead. You're clearly violating the rules of this sub by ridiculing the suffering of others.  




 Look son, I've read through your comment history enough* to know that I don't necessarily disagree with your politics. But there's no reason to be disrespectful to those who've come and died before you. 

I'm not happy about anyone dying. I just don't think it's necessary to be disrespectful to the people who've sacrificed against their will. It's tasteless and valueless vitriol.  




 Maybe for Republicans. 

Edit: Can one of you that downvoted me please provide an example of a Democratic candidate slinging mud at his or her opponent during this election cycle?  




 She's not wrong.  




 How admirable of you that you are able to observe all of the people in these photos of those who fought and those who died, and find the strength within to insult each and every one of them, their comrades, and their service to their countries and the world. It takes a special kind of person to make such elaborate and ridiculous work of converting O2 to CO2. 




 There is no conscription in the U.S.     
And even if you're from a country that does have a national service requirement (like Finland or Israel) then you can still passively resist. 

You really should do have a basic knowledge of the topic you're discussing or at least do a little research before you begin bloviating about a topic. American troops were drafted to fight in war until after the Vietnam War. Most of the soldiers who fought in WWII were draftees. Passive resistance resulted in serious prison time. 
 




 Too bad it's so american centered again..as if german,russian, japanese, british,candian,australian sodiers were not humans and didn't had their own share of misery and brutality

I seriously doubt that has anything to do with this particular album. 

Edit: This is the PM response I received from /u/arenothome:

cool story nerd

 




 You're thinking of "adolescence". Childhood is pretty much a universally accepted concept and has almost* always been so.  




 Until they find themselves faced with an unwanted pregnancy.  




 I don't know. I'm going to ask the mods. 

Edit: I've sent them two messages and received no response. It doesn't mqke sense to me as this movement is obviously right-wing and obviously politically motivated. It seems pretty relevant to politics to me. 

Response: what a conspiracy theorist writes on his facebook is not politics. Unless I was missing something he isn't a political figure. 

Counter: He's the leader of a political movement. He's mobilized more than a hundred like minded conspiracy theorists in an effort to shadow our armed forces during a routine military exercise. The people of texas and right-wingers across the country are taking him very seriously. If you're going to disregard him, then you should also disregard posts about Donald Trump, Rand Paul, and Scott Walker. 



 




 Took you four days to come up with that response? You should be ashamed. 

You should also be ashamed for demonizing people and children who are escaping poverty and abuse in countries that are in complete chaos as a result of backward, shortsighted US foreign policies. Have you no decency?  
























 There's an [update] (http://www.lamag.com/tag/crimeinla/page/2/) in their crime section.  




 No one is disputing those facts. This is what I was talking about:

On the witness stand,Jean-Marc Connerotte(fr), the original judge of the case, broke down in tears when he described "the bullet-proof vehicles and armed guards needed to protect him against the shadowy figures determined to stop the full truth coming out.Never before in Belgium has an investigating judge at the service of the king been subjected to such pressure. We were told by police that [murder] contracts had been taken out against the magistrates." Connerotte testified that the investigation was seriously hampered by protection of suspects by people in the government. "Rarely has so much energy been spent opposing an inquiry," he said. He believed that theMafiahad taken control of the case.

Edit: grammar.  




 Well, if they would have followed Trump's lead and not served at all they wouldn't be having these problems. /s While Senator McCain was serving in the Navy and rotting in a POW camp, Donald Trump was enjoying four education deferments and one medical deferment.  Those deferments afforded this spineless turd the opportunity to insult the Senator's military service on a national political platform. If Trump had been shipped to Vietnam he most likely would have been fragged by friendly fire.  




 Read the wiki that was posted in this thread.  




 Oh I see. That means the comment was removed. They probably don't want people linking to personal Facebook profiles because that constitutes doxxing.  




 Some people just want to watch the world burn.  




 Okay, but is it a picture of wildcats that have been painted?  




 Did you forget about the midterm elections? 

Also more voters turning up at the polls usually doesn't go well for the GOP. This is why they're so eager to implement policies that suppress voters.

 Those comments violate rule 2. Report them and let the mods sort them out.

 James Boyd, Freddie Gray, and Walter Scott.  




 You're a trip man. I hope you can keep a better train of thought when you're driving.  




 That's a lot easier to do when you have at least one reliable form of public transportation. The US has none, and doesn't look like it will ever* adopt mass transportation.  




 So? People who have their licenses revoked are often able to drive on a waiver. This gives them permission to drive to work, grocery shopping, and official stuff like court appearances.  




 That would only make sense in areas with reliable public transportation which excludes the vast majority of the country.  




 That dog like all vicious police dogs should be be put down. It should be illegal to train animals to attack people just like it's illegal to train fighting dogs.  




 Perhaps you failed to notice the requirement that an officer must have Reasonable Articulable Suspicion in order to request that a citizen identify themselves. And that's only in states that have stop and identify laws. As far as I know, New Jersey does not. So what would be the legal grounds for asking for identification then?  




 This isn't about me. This about the workers of America. My income level is irrelevant to this discussion. I have provided a source on the 50% that don't pay taxes. You read it. There's no point in having a discussion with someone who is incapable of comprehending new information.  




 I don't disagree at all. But as long as we expect people to cover their own living expenses we should foster an environment in which that is possible. Raising the minimum wage has a direct effect on the spending power of worker's wages.  




 You seriously think that 50% of us would go under if we didn't get constant support from the government. 

Yes. 25% are disabled and retired. The other quarter aren't making enough to survive. The ruling class or your "job creators" don't give a flying fuck about the retired and disabled and they'd pay the working poor even less than they do now if they were given the opportunity. You may remember the period in American history when the ruling class of the South paid their workers nothing. 

How messed up is that assumption? Fully half of our country is dependent on the other half to make sure their fridge works...

I'd argue that everyone is dependent on others for survival in some way. No one produces everything they consume from day to day and no one is capable of it. The people in the top 5% of wealth and income are much more parasitic than the retired and poor. They don't work in any traditional sense. They're kids don't have to work. They live off the fruits of other's labor. They use their money and power to buy politicians and influence our political system. They've even got people like you to defend them while they do all of this. 

That's not even close to being true and it's nowhere near the ideals that put this country in the leadership position it has now. If half the citizenry is taking rather than producing then in 20 years how many producers will there be? You have bought into this false idea that you need the government to succeed. 

Either you have a very selective memory or you're very ignorant about US history. The economic "leadship position" we've enjoyed in the last 70 years or so is the result of being the only super power that wasn't ravished by war after WWII and the fact that our leaders enacted quite a bit of policy that supported and protected the workers of this country. Because of voters like you the workers in this country have lost the support and stability they enjoyed for some forty odd years after the war. Now you've been convinced that this is the result of lazy people rather than a ruling capital class that has only one objective which is to invest as little as possible, pay no taxes, and keep all of the profits from fruits of our labor. Man, they saw you coming from miles and miles away. 

 




 Bwahaha! Good one.  




 Yeah, this. Never call the police for help. They're not going to help you. They're going to make your problems worse and they may kill you or your loved ones.  




 Why, because you said so?  




 Oh, I think we all know damn well where these brigades originate.  




 While flying too low and colliding with powerlines is some serious dipshitery, none of that is evidence of him being treated differently because of his high ranking family. As far as his youthful behavior, you might be surprised about the culture of young service members and especially pilots. The flying too low thing is more common than you'd want to know too.

 I don't disagree. I hope they find these assholes soon. I don't want to read about this happening to anyone else.  




 Yeah, that's not a source. That's just a paywall. And the title "Make* Believe Maverick" sounds more like an article attacking his political career, which I'm completely okay with.  



















 Maybe a business that cannot afford to pay its employees a sustainable wage doesn't deserve to exist? As long as people have to pay for food, shelter, medicine, and transportation, we have an obligation to afford them the opportunity to cover these costs. Allowing wages to remain below the level of basic sustenance is criminal.  




 And then?  




  illegal brown people

Seriously? 
 




 Nope. He was a rich education and medical deferment case.  




 I never understood why religious people are opposed to abortion. The bible includes a detailed explanation of how to properly conduct a holy abortion. It right there in the book of Numbers, chapter 5. It's gods word so it can't be wrong, right?  




 Link?  




 Donald Trump is a pompous blowhard. He lacks even the most basic military experience. He has no clue what problems our veterans are faced with. His corporate executive experience includes bankrupting [four companies] (http://thelawdictionary.org/article/how-is-donald-trump-able-to-file-for-bankruptcy-so-many-times/), and most recently alienating his most powerful corporate partners. He's a business hack with no experience in politics and he wants to be the most powerful elected official in our country?  



















 What's up OP? Where's the link?  




 They always exaggerate the value of busts. This is how the bolster their performance evaluations and resumes.
