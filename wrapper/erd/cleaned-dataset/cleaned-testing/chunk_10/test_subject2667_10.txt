 LOL, most American Muslims aren't even gun owners.  














 Narrations place her as old as 16, an din any case, it was no different than what was going on in other places in the world at the time. Then again, I'm wondering why we're jdpudging Muslims of today based on a one narration out of a possible many that took place 1400+ years ago. According to the bible, Noah repopulated the earth by having relations with his daughters. So we can we call Jews and Christians the followers of an incestuous prophet?  




 Oh, so you're an active member of the Church of England? Because that is the state religion.  




 I said actions, not party affiliation. 




 Fat chance, have you seen today's news?  




 Good for you. As a Muslim, I couldn't care less. Just respect our freedom in the same way you want us to respect yours.  




 Who made you the arbiter of patriotic loyalty in GB?  




 That's not the hashtag, but nice projecting there buddy.  




 Hey now, there's legitimate grievances there, and you can't look at this group and automatically label everyone that way. That's stereotyping.  




 Generally, I look at the actions of politicians to judge them, yes.  




 No, I'm pretty sure Sunni Islam believes the Mahdi will defeat him. They don't recognize the 12th Imam, but they do believe he is a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. [Numerous Sunnis have claimed the title throughout history.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdi) 




 Muslims believe that the Mahdi, a different person and a descendant of Muhammad, will defeat the Antichrist. Jesus will return though too and will recognize the Mahdi and follow him. The Mahdi is basically the Messiah in Islam.  




 Yeah, that's not true. There's an entire chapter in the Quran devoted to his mother, who is considered one of the holiest women in Islam, and there are several verses describing his birth, his life, the fact that he isn't the son of God (according to Islam), what he taught, etc. 




 Despite the source? Did you notice that the writer was Leander Schaerlaeckens? I know it was Yahoo!, but you have to look at the byline. 




 He was participating in the Civil Rights Movement back when Hillary was supporting Goldwater. That's not a joke.  









 The Miami Fusion and Tampa Bay Mutiny say hello.  




 Ask Jurgen.  




 Dude, he has a hamstring injury.  




 Jermaine Jones mistakenly spelled it that way in the weeks leading up to his transfer to New England, and we've spelled it that way ever since.  




 This was a nice article on Bill Hamid a few years ago dealing with the same thing: http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dc-uniteds-bill-hamid-finds-balance-between-body-and-spirit-during-ramadan/2012/07/31/gJQAWjUmNX_story.html 




 Never mind that there is already one power in the Middle East who already has nuclear weapons and refuses to sign any treaties.  




 No, it's a Zack Ryder - X-Pac tag team.  









 This article refutes everything that AIPAC says about Iran's nuclear program. I don't know what you're getting at.  




 New typo on his jersey this Gold Cup?  




 What did he say about Feilhaber?

  Gawker just wants to ride the fucking click-train.

That's every content provider on the internet, genius.  




 It's probably because he recommended Pao, and then saw her subsequently get crucified.  




 Because it could have backfired. Ellen Pao wants to protect hateful subreddits? The spin on that would be that she's no feminist at all, she's a hypocrite. Which probably speeds up her dismissal, but for different reasons.  




 We did it Reddit! 




 Synergy! 









 Username.  




 Fabinho might not be that good, but he doesn't count as a real LB?  




 And what happens when Brek is healthy again? Do they both play or does Ashe go right back to the bench?  









 Jozy is currently playing on a strained hamstring.  




 I enjoyed the DB DD with the BTs.  




 In this case, it's neither false, frivolous, nor potentially damaging (it's Reddit, for pete's sake), but nice try.  




 Olivia Wilde sort of looks like Lena Headley.  




 Thanks, but I doubt it will change a thing. I and others have called him out before.  




 Sematrix posts decent articles, but is a raging anti-Semite himself. Don't mistake his posts for legitimate criticism of Zionism, or of advocacy for the Palestinians. He represents neither.  




 I wonder if football fans will complain about penalty box and touchline lines on the field during NFL games.  














 One half of The Hart Dynasty, Tyson's old tag team.  









 A bunch of pretentious old men playing at ruling the world of football.

 That's redundant, chai already means tea! You're just saying tea twice!

 Her and Dwyer's kid? Pencil him/her in the USMNT/USWNT for World Cup 2038/2039.  




 **WOOSHCEPTION** 




 Acadamy? But where will the **academy** players go?  




 They get stars with a little help from their Becks.  




 DC Statehood! #TaxationWithoutRepresentation 




 If another city ponies up the money, a player will go there. Do you think Qatar and China have star power?  




 I THINK HE'S OFF AS OF A FEW WEEKS AGO.  









 **Submission Statement**

The article debunks the myths surrounding the Confederate flag, chiefly that it was a symbol of liberty against northern tyranny, demonstrating that the Confederate States of America weren't exactly a model of freedom themselves.  














 Chicago residents - call up local government and complain like crazy.  




 He had a bad foot, played through the pain, and got surgery afterwards.  














 I'm a US fan for life, but I'm sad De Rosario never got to play in a World Cup.  





























 He's in the royal family, who makes the laws. The royal family pretty much do whatever they want, and only the ordinary citizens are subject to the laws.  




 Maybe in some European places, but most of the time I've heard he's not a part of any team organization until he is signed to a professional contract. 




 No, this isn't part of any rules. The same thing could happen in Europe if a team doesn't sign an Academy player to a pro contract.

 Gaza's airport has been unused for quite a while now.  




 But was not signed to a professional contract, and under no ownership.  



















 Am I the only one who thinks that the NASL should focus on markets without any MLS presence?  




 Probably not, unless he was signed to the team as a professional.  




 ...what?  



















 Things get lost in translation. A new translation can be a new interpretation.  









 Barring women from going to school, for example. Nothing in Islam says that women can't be educated. Even in other countries with codes based on Islamic law, say Iran and Saudi Arabia, girls do attend school and university.  









 Uhh, what? I was first. http://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/3b5e1m/every_year_with_new_us_supreme_court_rulings/ 




 It's low-hanging fruit. All of these negative tweeters actually think SCOTUS blog is the Supreme Court.  




 You are not familiar with Afghanistan then. Literacy is so low and it's the reason that the Taliban's laws were so crappy. They couldn't understand the Quran they had memorized, and their laws contradicted Islam too.  




 WHY ARE YOU TRASH-TALKING YOUR OWN PLAYER?  




 IF THERE'S ONE THING MLS IS MISSING THAT EUROPE HAS, IT'S A RIGHT-WING, FACIST-LEANING CLUB.  




 FLAIR UP! 




 Yeah, I had that in mind when I added that "almost."  




 It's almost impossible to get wrong, though. You're literally sitting in the court building as the ruling is being made.  














 Great Sports Illustrated piece on Mudiay to people who don't know his story: http://www.si.com/nba/2015/06/24/emmanuel-mudiay-nba-draft-congo-china-texas-smu-larry-brown 














 There's stories like that narrated by other characters on the show too. Look up "history of Westeros" and "Histories and Lore" on YouTube. 




 From your [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordie_Howe_International_Bridge#Opposition), evidently the freaking Koch Brothers are involved too. 

 In early June 2011, the conservative group Americans for Prosperity posted bogus eviction notices on homes in Detroits Delray district. With the words "Eviction Notice" in large type, the notices told homeowners their properties could be taken by the Michigan Department of Transportation to make way for the proposed new bridge. The groups state director said the fake notices were intended to get residents to contact state lawmakers, to ask them to vote against the bridge project.[38]

 




 Eh, I wouldn't be too sure. Can you think of anyone who would be willing to buy a book written by her? She's hated by people of most races and most political persuasions.  




 That's why people use terms like Latino or Latina and Chicano in addition to Hispanic, and why on most forms, Latino is not identified as a race, but as an ethnicity - you'll see a notation that says something like "Latinos may one or more races." 




 Where did you get your journalism degree from?  




 Try clicking the news section on Buzzfeed. There's no clickbait in there.  




 We don't know if he's the heir. Tyrion says that Trystane is the youngest son in season 2.  




 That looks like a display set up by Pringles Corporate, though.  




 Most communities who do that won't do that indoors, though.  














 Unless you're a White Sox fan.  




 ...what was the point of that? That cloth is actually stained with rosewater, and that kind of decoration is only up in Muharram, when the tragedy of Karbala is being commemorated.  




 Brings my fast? 




 To combat sectarianism like this, go to Iftar this Ramadan to a mosque of which you are not the majority denominations and post pictures on social media with the hashtag. #IStandWithMyShiaCommunity, or #IStandWithMySunniCommunity and tag your friends.  









 You can't support a commercialized cartoon m8 




  Well, actually Howard is taking a break now as well.

And it is yet to be determined if he's back on the squad once the break is over.  









 NO GOLD! 









 So Chinese Muslims should engage in an armed rebellion against the Chinese government?  









 Might be prejudiced against Muslims. 




 With what? Guns? Wars? I don't see how either of those has anything to do with freedom of religion.  









 I can't believe that guy is married to Avril Lavigne.  




 What is ends meat? Does it taste good?  




 It's the world's most popular name. Which Mohammed are you referring to? Mohammed Ali, the Moroccan king, my friend from the mosque, Egyptian national football team member Mohammed Salah... 




 "Only." And that's not really true, restaurants are ordered to stay open.  




  I think you mean "bear arms," and I fail to see how owning a gun has anything to do with the freedom of religion.  









 How diverse is the Nordecke? Not trying to start anything, genuinely curious.  














 You'd think there would be a couple from when Jay DeMerit played there.  









 It is known.  









 He loves to sail, too.  




  little uppity bitch

-_- 



















 How does stuff like this happen? They don't even have an "Uncle Tom" Palestinian at the conference.   









 SHAME 




 She's from their militant wing.  




 Did they? Trystane was referred to as Doran's youngest son.  




 Sock puppet would also work.  




 Blazer, not Glazer, lol.  




 No more kingdoms! 




 Don't all bastards get that last name, not just the highborns?  




 To paraphrase Locke, "they were both highborn pricks." Why wouldn't they get along?  




 I can't remember where I read it, but "if anyone has an excuse to develop a spare tire around their waist, it's an over-the-hill luchador." 




 If you call split almost overwhelmingly against. ISIS's main opponents are also part of the Muslim faction.  




 I thought the Marines hadn't taken on the ISIS guild directly yet, instead backing the Iraqi and Kurdish guilds.  




 This is patently false. If you try a mosque forum, odds are you will be reported to higher level points before ever joining. The ISIS guild started from people who began on the fringes outside of the mosque forums. Many of the guild's recent members are people who checked out of the mosque forums because they didn't find any adversarial, vengeance seeking quests.  




 Yeah, I'm not following that fringe BS website, nor your completely reprehensible views. 

 In fact, I would rather let the Israelis kill every single last Palestinian man, woman, and child because at the end of the day, better them than us.

 




 You're projecting your thoughts into my head. My ideal solution is one single state where Jews, Christians and Muslims are living wherever they want and worshipping freely. If you call the death of a Jewish-only state as genocide, then you are deluded. 

The terrorists, the ISIS types, the ones who actually wish a military destruction of Israel would fight against "pro-Palestinians" if Israel is out of the way. They give Israel's military a justification, and most of us don't like that. It's why we have our own organizations and don't work with them. 

I want what happened to South Africa to happen to Israel. Last I heard, when the apartheid there ended, there wasn't some genocide of white South Africans. Now, prejudices there still remain, but people there aren't subject to discrimination and massive human rights violations.  




 You're putting stereotypes into my comment when there is nothing there. You might be right about sematrix, but you might be surprised how many people support the Palestinian cause because they are against the injustices committed against them, not because of some reprehensible prejudice against Jews. I'm no supporter of people like sematrix, as you'll see elsewhere in this thread. 

Groups like the Neuteri Karta, blogs like Mondoweiss (run by Jewish bloggers), individuals like Anna Baltzer and Max Blumenthal, and organizations like B'Tselem and Jewish Voice for Peace make it abundantly clear that the problem is not with Judaism nor the Jewish people. 




 I think people are downvoting you because of your reprehensible views, not because your statement is true. McCarthyist tactics are nothing to be proud of.  




 Sematrix, if you were just against Zionism and not Judaism or the Jewish people and weren't linking to a subreddit known as Gentiles United, I'd actually support you.  




 He's right. It's called canarymission dot com. Here's the [Forward](http://forward.com/news/308902/shadowy-web-site-creates-black-list-of-pro-palestinian-activists/) article on it.  




 What's the point of Tyrstane now? He's just going to get executed upon arrival in King's Landing despite having nothing to do with Myrcella's death. Or, even sooner if Jamie gets irrational and executes him on the boat.  




 What's to stop Jamie from turning the boat around and heading back to Dorne?  




 Does anyone have the video of him presenting the NXT Championship?  




 CLEGANE BOWL CONFIRMED 




 Your flairsake is still alive, at least we think.  




 Hey, we know who he is! He pays the iron price.  




 Whore! *splat* 




 Load the jump program. 




 The crown was also massively in debt while he was Master of Coin. I have a suspicion that he did that on purpose.  









 From Netanyahu's point of view, I mean. He's saying that the Palestinians will not know justice and freedom as long as Israel exists. I'm talking about Netanyahu saying it, not anyone else.  




 With or without context there is no way to justify that quote.  
























 You Targaryens are a contentious lot.  




 A lot of scholars say that covering the neck is part of hijab.  
























 I would add that the caste system has to figure into it. "The help" is probably not far off.  














 This is what I would say to those who argue that there no miracles today because religion does not exist. No, it's that they would still refuse to believe even if a miracle occurred in front of their very eyes.

 Misplaced javelins can't melt steel plot.  




 They should have applied that to the sand snakes... 




 You don't have to root for Ramsey. Brienne's still waiting... 




  He had also previously displayed a disgust at the action of burning people AND. A mistrust of Melissandre's methods.

Which is why the second season started with him burning a ton of people, and pledging loyalty to Melisandre.  




 The first guy who tries that is the first one killed.
