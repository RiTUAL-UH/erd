 This one is great, thank you morbo! 




 Yes, I do. Whenever I have some I take two 25mg hydroxyzine 10 minutes before I dose. I've found that it increases the nod. Can't say for sure whether it increases thr duration though. Comparatively I think it works better than diphenhydramine (Benadryl) for potentiation. 




 Exactly! Heroin certainly has a way of making you reevaluate your priorities though. 




 I use subs on a somewhat frequent basis and recently I had a conversation with someone who's been on them for way longer than me and had experience IVing them. He told me the naloxone is almost completely inactive due to buprenorphine having a much higher binding affinity for the mu opioid receptor, essentially 'outcompeting' the naloxone molecules at the receptor sites. Is there any truth to this?

edit: If this were true it would seem to imply that the naloxone would be inactive regardless of ROA 




 So you have 12 fingers now. Heh 




 Thought I could be a chipper and avoid the physical thralls of addiction. I still am, for now. But for me the psychological aspect of addiction has proven to be just as devastating as the physical withdrawals one can go through. I was naive to think that using infrequently would not lead to persistent, daily cravings. Intense cravings that eventually lead to rumination and thinking how good that next high will be. Not sure how long my love affair with opiates will last. Probably the rest of my life. 




 OC 120s??!?! I didn't even know those existed. Great stash, cheers 




 That's a beautiful rock man enjoy 




 I understand for the most part we live now in a world where crackheads, drunks and junkies seem to have this kind of hidden feud as to who is the better of the 3...

lol +1 for junkies, spending more time actually being high and less time fiending compared to crackheads is an advantage in my opinion 




 Thank for the advice. I guess I'll see if there are any major streets or corners in Holyoke so that I'll get a better chance of finding a dealer. 




 any tips to cold copping in holyoke? im in the 413. 




 Exactly haha, I've never gotten them for less than 25 a piece. Which is probably why I was so happy in my dream 




 Last night I had a dream that I picked up a few hundred bucks worth of 30mg oxys for the amazing price of 20 a piece off this girl I know. I was ecstatic, but as I began to crush up the pills I woke up. Needless to say I was very angry and frustrated.

I find this strange though because I'm a chipper and haven't used in over 50 days, even though I still get cravings every day. I realize mine wasn't particularly interesting, but I thought I'd ask here and see if anyone else had any similar dreams they would want to share. 




 Hahaha. Billy Mays ussd to love coke iirc, RIP 




 I usually just lurk but I saw someone post about how you were in a coma a while ago. Glad to hear you're doing well and have so much time sober. Stay safe 




 Love it, thank you for continuing to write stories on a regular basis for this sub. 




 I have taken up to 3mg xanax at shows before. I don't have a perfect memory of it but it's still not that bad. i have a bit of a tolerance though 




 yeah i know right the taste lingers too... I'll drink some water and it's still there 









 Daily limit is 4000mg, you're fine. 




 This is great, I really like the sense of community here and feel like I can post my thoughts without much fear of judgment. Stay high everyone :) 




 They do sell gel caps of dope in Baltimore. It's called scramble and it's usually dope cut with quinine to increase the rush when you IV it. It's meant to be IV'd but not snorted. 




 You're right, I remembered wrong. Just looked up the imprint and they're 8mg. 




 Haha yeah man it's great! Best stuff I've had in a while 




 Not as euphoric as Xanax but still good. The only bad thing about them in my opinion is the long half life, so if I take a few too late in the day I'll wake up groggy and still a bit high the next day. 




 My bad they're 8mg each. 




 2 pink pills: Adderall 30mg IR  
Generic bars: Xanax 2mg  
Xanax imprint bars (pressed by a friend): 2.5-2.8mg Xanax  
Blue footballs: Xanax 1mg  
Orange capsule: Vyvanse 30mg  
Orange circle pills: generic Suboxone 8mg  
Blue circle pills: generic diazepam 10mg  
Bag in the middle: .5g fire Baltimore ECP  
Hope you're all having a great Monday :) 









 Bang that shit  




 If you don't mind me asking, how's your working memory on this combination, and how do you focus at work without nodding really hard? Obviously if you're shooting .15g you must have a massive tolerance to dope but whenever I combine benzos and opiates my working memory and motivation goes to shit. Is your job very mentally demanding? 




 You're gonna wait 3 weeks, do it again, wait 2 weeks, then "wait, I don't have to wait this long, i can just use on the weekends, oh wait I should totally reward myself for doing so well with something else in my life i don't need to wait till the weekend, shit now I need more to get high, that guy I got it from was just a middleman and doesn't deal, I need a real dealer, where's my shit I just called him up and he said he'd be here, fuck I feel like shit where's my heroin, I'm bored and just want to get high, nothing else interests me anymore, now I'm sick since I can't afford any, fuck, I've been clean 2 days and it feels like 2 years" This can happen and does happen for a lot of people, be careful. 




 Yeah we met up earlier this week remember? Being on probation must suck man I wish you the best with your court dates and I hope you don't catch any more charges. Things are alright with me I'm just doing my best to pass all my classes. I'll be around for the summer. 




 Thank you for posting this, I'm sure I'm not just speaking for myself when I say you are a very inspirational person. Stay positive.
