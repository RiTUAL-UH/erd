 "This research hasn't given humanity a cure to any diseases or made any claims of human life extension but it is an important first step in more fully understanding the lifecycle and function of cells." 




 I wonder whether the effects of menopause/hormone loss in older women contributes to this at all? 




 I agree with the points others have made here; in addition, even the idea of "dominant" and "recessive," although still taught in most intro biology classes, does not reflect how most genes work at all.

Genes tell cells how to make proteins.  Genes that code for proteins that are skin pigments, or a protein that helps signal to the cell to create more or less of a skin pigment, or a protein that helps transport or degrade skin pigment, will all have some impact on what the resulting skin color is.  Differences in the DNA sequence of any of these genes will make that particular protein work a bit differently, and how the body will be affected by having two somewhat different versions of that protein around (being heterozygous for that gene) will depend on what the protein usually does, how the sequence differences affects the protein's function, and how much that protein is being used by the body at a given time.

What all this means is: there is no one gene that makes skin black or white.  This should be apparent anyhow.  There are almost infinite different shades of skin in the world, not just two; and even a single individual will have a different skin color depending on their age, their exposure to sun, and other factors.  Even if you focus on a single gene that influences skin color, there aren't just two possible alleles, with one producing a dominant trait and one producing a recessive trait. How an allele affects a trait is kind of like how putting either white sugar, brown sugar, maple syrup, honey, molasses, or another sweetener into a cookie would affect the taste.  How that one thing interacts chemically with everything else in the cookie will determine what the effect is, and how noticeable it is in comparison with other ingredients.

If you'd like to read a cool pop science book on evolution in general (not at all related to skin color  . . . ) I recommend *The Beak of the Finch:* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beak_of_the_Finch. 




 Another really interesting comparison discussed in the article is between individual ants and individual neurons in the brain.  The way that information spreads through a large ant (or bee) colony can actually be used to better model or understand how information spreads through the brain, and the way colony collectively solves problems can be similar to the way a network of neurons solves problems.

Hive minds are real! 




 This is a really speculative headline, not supported by the actual research findings; it also covers two primary research articles that have both already been posted, not a new research finding.

The research is incredible and their future plans include use of the "brain net" for therapy, but there's no current evidence of a therapeutic application.

 All the comments here already are awesome.  I just wanted to add that at least for me, it isn't just about getting motivated/making myself get out there to run in order for running to alleviate anxiety and depression.  Although I'm sure the endorphins etc. help, it's also the feeling of accomplishment and sense of discipline that comes from having made myself do a tough run, or a run on a day when I felt tired and discouraged, that makes me feel more positive about myself.  On days when I feel useless and like nothing I'm working on is ever going to be successful, going for a run (even a short and slow one) can be something that I got to put a check mark next to and feel good about.

Find a time of day and a training plan that really work with your other habits and your schedule, so you have as few practical barriers as possible.  If you work starting at 5 PM (wow, 12 hour night shift sounds brutal) maybe run in the early afternoon, like a pre-breakfast run for other people? You could probably start by just running on your days off, and adding this in on an occasional workday as running gets easier.  Reward yourself with a playlist or an audiobook that you only get to listen to while you run, or something fun you only get to do on days when you worked out.

I think anyone who has run (maybe any adult who exists, actually) has been heckled at some point, although certainly some demographic groups have the misfortune to be a more frequent target.  If you do encounter that, just try to tell yourself inside your head (or maybe out loud, as long as it's not a physically threatening situation) that you feel sorry for them.  How pathetic that they can't find a better way to interact with the world around them. 




 Warning, anecdote follows!

I live where there is literally only one hill in town (and it's man-made!) and run races in other parts of the state that actually have substantial hills.

In my personal experience, there is no perfect experience for running hills, but a combination of speed work, parking garage ramps, and stairs (on different days, obviously) does help a lot.  Doing a longer run and some rounds of stairs in the middle or at the end seems a little closer to a run with real hills in it, than a workout that's mostly just stairs repeats.

I don't really know a good exchange rate; I just try to compare effort, not time or distance. 




 If I'm understanding the research correctly at all, it's not inherent to the bacteria alone.  It happened when the researchers added feedback from the robot to the bacteria into their theoretical model.  When the robot starts to get close to a food source, it sends a chemical signal to the bacteria that boosts all the signals they are producing. I'm guessing this first drowns out the original food signal a bit, then enhances it if it's a true signal, making the robot "rush" forward.

So although they haven't tested this in a real experiment, they predict from their model that this is a natural property that unexpectedly emerged from the two-way chemical communication between the machine and the bacteria. 









 No problem!  I should have also said, good luck with everything :-) 




 The original paper is here: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature14622.html 














 The researchers did not do anything to examine learning in this study.  They examined the impact of their transcranial stimulation protocol on EEG activity, and examined adverse side effects.

They suggest that this method of stimulation could someday be used in a therapeutic capacity, but have not tested this yet.

 Really exciting work and a great direction of innovation for the future of the environment.

However: not made "entirely of wood." Made with "minimum use of expensive, environmentally toxic semiconductor materials," cellulose derived from wood, and epoxy coating to protect the cellulose from moisture.

 It seems like you'll just have to wait for further communication to know anything for sure, so don't take anything below too seriously, but:

1. It's possible they've waited because there's a potential funding source that makes it possible for an advisor/the department to accept you (or that covers another student, freeing up departmental funding for you; or another student who declines at the last minute.)

2. I've never heard of a rejection letter being approved by a dean, but my knowledge of administrative workings across the country isn't that great.

3. It's much less usual to be accepted without an interview, but it does happen.  Usually it's because of some mitigating circumstance (the applicant lives outside the country, or has unsurmountable time conflicts, for example.)

So maybe this means some sort of acceptance offer is on the way to you.  However, it does seem like you're missing some key information about what's going on, and if you're accepted, it will be under strange/confusing circumstances, and with limited options.

If you're very passionate about graduate school, it might be worth considering pursuing something related for a year (finding a job in a related field, taking some additional classes if that option is open to you, etc.) and then have another try at the GRE and the application process again in the next year or two, with more experience and maybe some better scores.  That could result in you being much more secure and confident entering the next stage of your education.  Graduate school is hard enough on self-image and emotional health already; going into it feeling shaky about your own confidence level, or the confidence of others in you, would be a rough position to start from. 




 I wonder what non-audible cues babbler birds use, if any, to help clarify their meaning in a social context :-) 




 Because sounds, visible markings, gestures, and a few other things can all be used to achieve symbolic communication, and in this case, a written symbol stands for a sound (which both birds and humans use.)

There are interesting analogies between many seemingly unrelated areas, including between animal communication and DNA, as the original commenter alludes to. 




 You said you had "simply no idea" what they meant by their second comment.  I just thought that could be misconstrued as a bit combative, so I was suggesting where miscommunication might be happening. This is a cool topic, so might as well keep the tone friendly, even if there are different ideas or levels of knowledge!
