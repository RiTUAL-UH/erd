 Its no secret that big cities have pigeon problems. Toronto was no exception. Like rats in the middle ages, the disease-carrying vermin spent the past decade running amok and increasing their numbers. It was my job to try and keep Torontos ever-growing pigeon population in check. Thankfully, I came across an article about a pilot project where researchers replaced pigeon eggs with wooden substitutes. The birds, too stupid to know the difference, spent months caring for the fake eggs instead of producing more. The project was a huge success, and the pigeon population decreased significantly in a short amount of time. It sounded like the perfect plan, so I implemented the solution in my city. What I didnt count on was for those fake eggs to hatch, and for the abominations inside to be released into the world.

***

Clint, my partner, came in one morning carrying a large wooden crate with straw poking out of every crevice.

Looks like Christmas came early this year, he said, What is this stuff?

I walked over excitedly, helping him set the box down on a workbench, This, I said, prying it open to reveal its contents, is the solution to our pigeon problem.

Reaching inside, I took one of the eggs. I was a little disappointed to see that they werent wooden, as promised. Instead, they were thin, light, and hollow like those cheap plastic Easter eggs. It wasnt close to what I was expecting. *Oh well, thats what you get for ordering off of Ebay*, I thought.

Clint took a handful, *These* are the replicas you ordered? They dont feel remotely the same as the real deal.

We were well aware of what the eggs felt like. Up until then, the only way to decrease the pigeon population was to sneak into their nests and steal the eggs. It was a futile, temporary solution, because the birds would just lay new eggs once they realized theirs were gone. Thats what made the idea of using substitutes so damn good.

Its fine, Clint. They dont have to fool *us*, they just have to fool the pigeons. Thisll work, trust me, I answered.

I was right: the pigeons fell for it, hook, line, and sinker.

***

A few months passed, and we started seeing a decline in the amount of younger birds in the area. I cant tell you how proud I was of what Id done. Id found a safe, environmentally friendly way of dealing with the flying rats, at the cheap cost of a few hundred dollars and an elevator trip to pigeon nesting grounds atop high-rise rooftops around the city.

The problems started about three months in. Clint and I were inspecting nests on opposite sides of the city. I was halfway up the building when Clint called me.

Yo, I said as I brought the phone to my ear.

The sound of wind could be heard in the background. Evidently, Clint had reached his destination, Hey. Some of our eggs broke, he announced.

The elevator came to a stop, doors swinging open to let me off. I stepped out and made my way to a small staircase leading to the rooftop.

Well just have to replace them. No big deal, I answered nonchalantly.

There had been a few violent storms since our last inspection, and I figured the eggs must have fallen from the nests and shattered on impact. *See, this is why wood would have been better*, I grumbled to myself, as I exited onto the rooftop for my inspection.

Well, fuck, I said.

What? answered Clint.

Most of my eggs were broken, too. The strange thing was that they were still tucked in the nests, right were wed left them. Had the pigeons figured out our ploy and attacked the replicas? Were the fake eggs too frail to survive our harsh Canadian weather?

I groaned, Its the same here. Were going to have to start over, I told him, defeated.

Clint laughed, Its all good, we can *hatch* a new plan.

I paused for a moment, Did you just- I began, but he interrupted.

Just look on the *sunny side up* of things, yeah?

Puns. At a time like this. Puns.

Dont yolk with me, I replied, with a sigh.

***

We couldn't leave the nests unattended for too long, otherwise all our progress would go down the drain. I sent Clint to replace the broken eggs with what was left from our original order. In the meantime, I searched online for anyone selling wooden eggs. Unfortunately, the cheapest -and fastest shipper- was the person we'd ordered from the first time around. We needed these eggs quickly, and our budget was pretty tight. I figured I'd order the subpar eggs one more time. If they lasted long enough for city officials to see the plan was working nicely, then I was sure I could convince them to increase our budget so we could order better supplies next fiscal year.

Just to be sure the pigeons werent attacking our fake eggs, I also set up a security camera on one of the rooftops. I needed to know if theyd gotten wise to our ruse, though I highly doubted they had the mental capacity to do so. Still, the project would prove fruitless if the birds werent fooled by our cheap imitations, so it was best to keep an eye out.

***

Over the course of the following weeks, I started getting strange reports about small animals behaving weirdly. Frankly, I didnt pay much attention to them, at first. They sounded a little insane, to tell the truth. One woman claimed shed seen a pigeon *climb* a tree. She said he crawled up the bark like a squirrel. Another report stated that a chipmunk had been seen attacking and killing a neighborhood dog. Another witness called in about an injured cat, but when he investigated, all he found was a pelt.

By the time I read the fifth report, I was starting to get a little worried. What was even more troubling to me was that these reports were coming from all over the city. If it had been confined to a single neighborhood, I would have suspected an outbreak of rabies, or a new disease of some sort. But the reports were coming in from all around Toronto *and* its suburbs, which span an extremely large area. How could anything spread so quickly? It had to be something else.

I was just about to do a bit of research on the subject when Clint came in, wearing a scowl.

Broke. Shitty fucking eggs broke again, he grumbled, throwing himself on his chair.

I forced a grin, *Crack* a smile, would ya?

He tossed his worksheet on the table, That was an egg-cellent pun, he replied, releasing a single chuckle.

You remember to bring the footage? I asked him.

He unzipped his coat and reached into his pocket for an SD card, Gotcha covered. Movie time! he chirped.

We uploaded the footage and took a look.

***

Pigeons.

Pigeons sitting on their nests.

Pigeons preening.

Pigeons flapping their wings at one another.

A squirrel.

A squirrel getting chased away by birds.

More pigeons.

It must have been the dullest security tape in the world. The kind of footage that even David Attenboroughs lovely voice wouldnt be able to save. We fast-forwarded through days of pigeons doing pigeon-y things. Never once did they show any violence towards our replica eggs.

Clint had dozed off by the time something finally happened on-screen. The only reason I was still conscious was due to the copious amount of coffee Id ingested that morning.

It was dead of night. In the video, at least. One of the birds flew off its egg and perched itself on the nest, peering inside. *This is it*, I thought, leaning closer to the screen. I figured hed attack the egg, but I was wrong.

I watched as the video soundlessly continued, and something cracked open the egg --- from the *inside*. My jaw gaped open. This wasnt possible: the eggs were plastic shells. The only explanation was that wed missed one *real* egg somewhere in the bunch. Yeah, that had to be it. I was witnessing the birth of a baby pigeon, nothing weird.

Except baby pigeons dont look like smoke.

A puff of dark air came out of the egg. The pigeon, head inches from it, inhaled the gassy substance. It reared back and stood completely still for about a minute, before falling over. I watched as it started thrashing violently, like it was having a seizure. Then, from its beak spewed some kind of chunky liquid that evaporated as soon as it hit the air. The pigeons body seemed to deflate like a balloon, as though the creature was being hollowed out. I was left staring incredulously at the flat, immobile husk of what had once been a pigeon.

Suddenly, the pigeons chest bulged out and the animal regained its form. At least, sort of. Its proportions were all wrong: its wings were bloated and angled oddly, most of its girth was in its neck rather than stomach, and its midsection had stretched out unnaturally. It was like looking at an animal pelt draped over the wrong mound. Like a lunatic taxidermists cruel experiment. The abomination of nature jerked its head towards the ledge. It twisted onto his back, legs contorting and dislocating in such a way as to be able to reach the ground. From its throat, I could see stump-like arms stretching out, clawing at the cement rooftop. In quick and jagged movements, the creature skittered over the edge, and disappeared from view.

I was shocked, unable to believe what I had seen. I had to watch and re-watch the video several times, before it occurred to me to wake Clint up. He grumbled unhappily, rubbed his tired eyes, and looked at me.

You wont believe this, I uttered.

I rewound the footage and pressed play. His eyes widened with the same disgusted disbelief as mine. Even on my fifth viewing, I couldnt wrap my head around it.

This is bad, he said.

 I know, I answered.

***

After watching the video a few more times, we went home. I think we both hoped a good nights sleep would help clear our minds. Maybe, upon reviewing the tape, wed realize we were mistaken. Maybe it was a trick of the light? Unlikely, but we could only hope.

Clint was already at work when I came in. His eyes were glued to the screen.

Watching it again? I asked.

Not exactly, he replied,  I  kept going.

I approached the desk and peered at the monitor, Kept going? I questioned.

His face was pale and his eyes weighed down by large bags. How long had he been here? Had he come in extra-early?

There was two days left of footage on the card, he explained.

And you went through it?

Yeah 

Did you see  more of those things?

Clint pressed his lips together, Yeah  and  some of them came back, he explained.

I raised my eyebrows, looking closer at the screen. I noticed something odd about one of the nests. There were multiple eggs resting in the sunlight. They were neither genuine pigeon eggs, nor replicas. They were too big for that.

Clint pointed to the batch, his hand trembling, *It* laid them, he murmured.

I felt a flush of nervous energy climb up my spine like an elevator, and then turned to the reports Id been reading the day before. Were the eggs at the center of it all?

We need to call the authorities, I uttered shakily.

We ARE the authorities, he replied, his voice sounding frantic.

I paced around the room. Back and forth, back and forth, like a pendulum.

The phone rang, interrupting my anxious march. It was another report of odd animal behavior. This time, the culprit was a deer. In a spooked and almost disgusted tone of voice, the woman on the line explained that she'd seen a deer slithering along the river. She said its body was sideways, but its head was upright. *Oh god*, I thought. What ever those things were, they could affect larger animals. While I tried to comfort the worried caller, I heard something from Clint's workstation.


**Crack**

I turned around, only to see a puff of smoke rising towards my coworker. Near his keyboard was a cracked shell, just like the ones on the rooftop. Without a word, Clint bolted to the bathroom, holding a hand over his mouth as though about to puke. I dropped the phone and ran over to the door. It was locked.

"Clint ... are you okay?"

Silence.

Silence.

Silence.

All of a sudden, I heard him heaving violently. A sound of moist gurgling and boiling water erupted from the bathroom. Terrified of what would happen if Clint got out, I pushed the heavy workbench in front of the door. I stood in terrified silence as the noise came to a stop. Was Clint now lying as flat as a pancake against the porcelain throne? Would it turn into some sort of bastardization of a human body, like what happened to the pigeon?

Silence.

Silence.

Silence.

**BANG**

Clint threw himself against the door violently. Just one blow nearly threw the thing off its hinges. Again and again, he slammed himself against the surface, causing the workbench Id placed in front of it to slowly inch away. All I could do was push myself against it to try and keep the door closed. My only thoughts were to keep him from escaping, for my own safety. I knew hed attack me if I let him out. I just knew it.

The sound came to an unexpected halt, allowing me to breathe a sign of relief. Maybe he'd expired. Maybe that *thing* needed fresh air to survive. Whatever the reason, I thought I was safe.

But then, I heard a crash. The window. I'd forgotten all about the bathroom window.

He's out there now. Him, and those other mutated atrocities. I don't know what they are or what they want. All I know is that they're roaming the city right now, doing god knows what. Most of them probably look like pigeons, but they can be anyone or anything. I just hope someone figures out how to stop them because, at last count, there were over 700 of those cursed eggs planted around Toronto. Now that I know these things can reproduce, god knows how many more eggs might be out there.

 Go ahead and post this to /r/nosleepfinder . Someone is bound to recognize the story over there. Good luck! 




 It's all about scope. If the town is in the middle of nowhere, then maybe it can be wiped out without anyone noticing. 




 I think you should just change the names and locations. It'll make your story easier to follow than if you exclude names altogether. 




 You'd think people would be more responsible for their own needs, right?

It's especially puzzling since they can easily filter out things with trigger warnings to start with. 




 I see the trigger warning just fine. 




 A lot of people do it without asking for permission, but I have been approached a few times, too. It's not uncommon for their account histories to be empty: often times, they make an account because it's the fastest/easiest way to contact the writer. 




 If I'm not mistaken, I believe the limit is 40 000 characters (not *words*), but the textbox accepts more characters on-edit, so you can potentially increase the length after posting.

If you split the story up into series, make sure every part has a beginning, middle, and end and can sort of stand alone.

In my personal experience, I've found that stories around 1 700 - 2 000 words do better. Nice little bite-sized stories. 




 It's okay, you were part of a super-secret elite club! 




 I wish there was a setting in my brain that could change the sound of my thoughts. If such a thing were possible, I'd change it to your soft, melodic voice, dear Yara. 




 Mr. Sanderson, would you kindly give your life savings to me? Thank you. 




 I like for most of my characters to be either dead or alive. Just like Schrodinger's KITTEH. 




 It ended on time, for the first time ever. :O 




 CANADIAN!!! My brethren, I forgive you, for you are one of my kin.

 Sorry, I misunderstood your question. If it is *implied* that the narrator dies after the story is posted (I.e. He hears the door opening behind him, and we assume he's about to get eaten by a mutant penguin-lama), then he or she should not respond to comments. 




 The narrator cannot die at the end, that's against the rules---UNLESS someone else posts for them. I.e. A friend finds this person's journal after his death and decides to put it online.

 Theoretically, you can't prove or disprove that supernatural entities exist. Therefore, it is *possible* for them to exist, so long as what they do doesn't affect a ridiculously large portion of the population, where one could easily disprove what happened. I.e. "A gang of vampires rode into NYC and drank everyone's blood" vs. "I saw a vampire in my basement." 




 I have below-average social skills and I'm not what anyone would describe as handsome.

That can't be right, Mr. Blank Lyset. I happen to know for a fact that people by the name of "Lyset" are handsome sons of guns. 




 There's a bit of "real life" in most of my stories, whether it be a description of a place I've been to, an object I saw that inspired the story, or an event that I twisted into something supernatural.

I did see a *lot* of weird stuff when I was in high school and have never written about it, mainly because there's no clear resolution. Sure, I could make up a whole backstory and ending to it, but it feels weird to me to embellish something that *actually* happened. If I'm going to embellish something, I rather take an event that had nothing supernatural to it, and supernaturalize it. 




 The commenters commenting on plagiarism are plagiarism the commenters commenting on plagiarism.

Don't worry too much about it, just report the comment. You'll be hard-pressed to find a story where there isn't one guy claiming it sounds a lot like another story. 




 I didn't understand why her father kept her locked in that run-down shed in the woods. When I first saw her chained in that musky place, I was too drunk to figure it out. If only I had paid attention, I might have been able to save her.

***

Judging by the dozens of missed call on my dying phone that afternoon, high school officials had informed my mom that I had skipped again. My friends and I had something more important to do than calculus: getting shit-faced drunk in the woods behind the school. Before we knew it, it got dark, and the group disbanded. 
In my drunken haze, I must have taken a wrong turn, because I wound up deeper in the forest, where I came across a lone shed. As far as I could see, it didn't belong to any home or cottage. It was just there, in the middle of nowhere. *A hunters hut?* I wondered, *No. What the fuck would they be hunting here  groundhogs?*

Stumbling forward, I began hearing sobs escaping through the cracks of the old wooden structure. They were definitely the cries of a human girl. My head spun in a pleasant buzz, turning a simple walk into an awkward zig-zaggy trek. As I reached the shed, my foot sunk in a particularly deep patch of snow, causing me to lunge forward. My hand rose towards one of the walls for support. It went right through the wood, the plank disintegrating into soft mush, like a soggy piece of bread. *Gross.* After steadying myself and wiping my hand on my pants, I peered into the hut through the hole Id just inadvertently created.

It was blurry inside, though that was probably due to the alcohol in my system. I squinted to try and make out shapes through the darkness, but it was almost impossible to see. If I hadn't heard another whimper, I might have missed her entirely. There was a girl, maybe 5 years old, curled up in the corner. Her arms and legs were bound in thick iron chains, which rattled as she desperately pawed at a stuffed bear just out of reach. She looked up and, for a brief moment, our eyes met. I could feel her fear and sorrow, chipping away at my heart. Through her messy, curly black locks of hair, her lips stretched into a shy smile. She was covered in filth, but seemed otherwise healthy. *What kind of sick monster can do this to a kid?* I wondered.

H-hey, I called out.

Still wearing a solemn smile, she stretched an arm towards me, but the chains held it back. She didn't speak, but her hopeless eyes told me all I needed to know.

Ill get you out of there, I promised.

I staggered to the door, reaching for the handle. I pushed and pulled, but the damn thing wouldn't open. The simple latch might have been too much in my drunken state.

Returning to the window, I waved to get her attention, I'm going to go for help, I said, through slurred speech, I promise, Ill get you out of there.

***

I ran straight for the nearest squad car as soon as I returned to civilization. My first mistake was banging the passenger window frantically to get the attention of the cops inside. My second mistake was screaming profanities at the cops as they tackled me to the ground and cuffed me. Why couldn't I have calmly gone up to them and explained the situation in a rational manner? I could have feigned sobriety. It obviously would have worked out better. Instead, I acted like a weird drunken teenager, cussing up a storm and making insane claims that Id come across a psychopaths murder hut.

I was arrested for drunken and disorderly conduct.

***

Well, fuck, I murmured, as my jail cell locked shut.

Sober up, kid. Well call your mom to pick you up in the morning, said the officer.

*Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck*, I thought, irritated. Id gone from trying to free an imprisoned child, to winding up just as locked-up as she was. Eventually, I dozed off on an uncomfortable metal bench in the back of the cell.

***

In the morning, I was awoken by the sound of jangling keys. The prison guard unlocked my cell and led me to the main desk. I looked around for my mom, but she was nowhere to be seen.

So  I just get to go home now? I asked.

Yeah, he answered, barely paying attention to me.

And my mom ?

She bailed you out last night. She said, and I quote: Let that ungrateful prick sleep it off. He can walk home in the morning. Its called tough love, kid, he replied.

I furrowed my brows.  Yup, that sounded like mom all right. Probably trying to teach me a lesson, like that time she made me watch a *Scared Straight* marathon after I was caught shoplifting.

Did anyone check out that shed? The one I kept screaming about last night? I asked.

The officer laughed, patting me on the back, Yeah, we sent a few officers to scope the area. Theres no cabin, kid. Take my advice and lay off the drugs, he told me, using a condescending tone that reminded me of my father.

*Prick.*

I needed to go back, if only to prove what I saw was real. Mom was probably going to get a call from school again, but I didn't care. At least I was skipping for a *good* cause this time.

***

There it was, behind a row of snowy maple trees. The small shed where I'd seen the girl. A new wooden plank concealed the hole I had made, suggesting someone had been by since my visit the night before. The door proved much less of a challenge in the light of day and without chemicals swimming in my blood. I was amused by my own inability to complete such a simple task while under the influence. The door scraped along the snow-covered forest floor as I pulled it open. Sure enough, there she was. The girl Id seen. Somehow, despite her awful situation, she was fast asleep under a thick blanket. She looked so peaceful that I decided not to wake her.

The door to the claustrophobically small shed closed behind me with a *click*. It was warmer than expected inside the cracked structure. Roughly the size of four office cubicles, the shed was full of oddities, such as an army of broken garden gnomes, bags of seashells, and old store signs, as well as normal shed stuff, like wheelbarrows, shovels, a car tarp, toolboxes full of rusted equipment, and a lawnmower. The weirdest thing of all was the net stapled to the ceiling. It wasnt a cheap little bug net, either. It was the kind you see on fishing boats: a big, thick net capable of holding thousands of unruly sea creatures. As far as I could tell, it served no purpose, other than to freak me out.

The girl stirred, her soft brown eyes opening. She immediately reached for her teddy bear, but it was still too far away. She pulled on hers chains, to no avail. There was little to no slack, especially on the ones around her ankles. I picked the teddy bear up, and handed it to her. An overwhelmingly happy smile was given to me as a reward. How could she be so upbeat, after the horrors she'd endured? 

"I'm going to get you out of here," I said. 

Kneeling down in front of her, I fiddled with the cuffs on her wrists. Unfortunately, lock picking was a skill I'd only learned in videogames. Try as I might, I couldn't get them undone. *Okay, no problem,* I thought. Maybe the chains were attached to the mushy, rotten, decomposing walls. Surely, I'd be able to break the wood to free her. I pulled off her blanket to reveal a concrete slab from which the chains emerged. It looked as though theyd been molded right into the block. I needed to use a different strategy.

"What's your name?" I asked, as I examined each link for signs of weakness.

She didn't answer. Instead, she just smiled and hugged her bear.

Well, my names Adrian, I told her.

I was really counting on finding rusted links that I could break off, but had no such luck. Unlike the other objects in the shed, the chains were in pristine condition. If I wanted to break them, I was going to have to use some tools. I rummaged through the toolboxes for anything that might do the trick. I hammered, I sawed, I reserve-wrenched, but it was all in vain. All I had to show for a mornings worth of work were a few scratches on a single link. The chains were simply too strong.

The girl silently watched me work. Every now and again, I asked her questions. Her favorite color, tv show, superhero. She only ever smiled to acknowledge my question, but kept her lips sealed shut.

***

An animalesque whine escaped her lips while I was in the middle of sawing the chain for the fifth time. Half its teeth had broken off in the process, but I had stubbornly continued my work. I stopped for a moment and listened, only to hear footsteps approaching. She pointed to one of the corners of the shed, as though to telling me to hide. Like a cockroach, I scurried into the darkness, hiding behind the garden gnomes. One of them glared at me with his beady little eyes. *The fuck you looking at?* I thought.

A pair of feet came into view. I was half-expecting him to look like a flesh-eating lunatic of some sort, but what I saw was a middle-aged man dressed quite plainly. He shook snow off his salt-and-pepper hair, and closed the door behind him. There was a picnic basket nestled under his arm, which he set down next to the girl.

Lunchtime, Emma, he announced, his voice strangely mournful.

He pet the childs head and, to my surprise, she didn't recoil in terror. *Stockholm syndrome?* I theorized. The man began to pull out a variety of lovingly-prepared food items. Heart-shaped sandwiches, a bowl of warm soup, colorful fruit-kabobs, and even a cupcake for dessert. He took great care in hand-feeding her the meal hed made. As I lay there, watching the scene unfold, he gave me the impression more of a loving father than that of a murderous child-abductor. My stomach gurgled hungrily at the feast, but I tried to will it to stop, for fear that itd give me away. I couldnt help Emma if I got caught and chained up next to her.

Once she finished the meal, he put everything back in the picnic basket, and gave her a toy truck, "I'll be back in time for supper, honey. Be good," he murmured, kissing her forehead.

My face twisted at the sight. How could someone be so delusional? I stayed hidden long after he left the shed, just in case hed come back. Eventually, I crawled out, my stiff neck crackling with relief. Emma was playing with her new toy, a happy smile on her face.

My afternoon was spent much like the morning, hacking away at the chains, to no avail. As supper drew near, I became increasingly nervous. I knew her father would return soon, and I needed to get home. I had to make a tough call. 

"I'll be back tomorrow, okay?"

She smiled and nodded.

I hated the thought of her spending the night alone, but I had to go. There was no other choice.

***

I had only one mission when I got to school the next day: break into the janitors closet where he kept the lock cutter. I knew he had one, since the school had performed a random drug search on my unit the month before.

I followed Mr. Bentley as he roamed about, picking up litter in the hallway. Every time he looked my way, Id act like I was checking my phone. I'm not sure if he bought it, but my shifty behavior certainly didn't keep him from eventually unlocking the maintenance closet. I kept my distance, and waited for him to exit. Once he did, I subtly slid my foot between the door and its frame to keep it from closing. I slipped inside, heart racing, and searched for the lock cutter.

There would be trouble if I was caught, and I couldn't afford the delay. Emma needed me, and there was no way I was sitting in the principals office all day over something as stupid as borrowing school property. I had to be quick. Pushing through a pile of useless junk, I found what I came for: the cutters.

***

It was snowing that afternoon as I travelled back into the forest. *Free the girl, bring her to the cops, be a hero*, I repeated to myself. They had no choice but to believe me if I brought her in. I clutched the metallic jaws close to my chest, my moist mittens sticking to its cold surface. Emma, as always, welcomed me with a big bright smile.

"This time, were getting you out," I told her confidently.

I prayed my plan would work, as I slid the lock cutter's jaws between her skin and the shackle around it. The cuff was tight and there was barely enough room for it to fit, but I managed to wiggle it in any ways. Emma looked terrified. Maybe she feared the device was going to cut her hand off?

"Don't worry, this won't hurt," I reassured, "On the count of three, okay? Deep breath ... one ... two ... three!"

I brought my arms down with all my might. 

**SNAP**

She yelped as the cuff cracked open like an egg, freeing her right hand. It immediately reached for my arm, holding it tightly. I repeated the process until Id freed every limb. Then, I took her into my arms and ran towards the door, leaving the lock cutter behind. She was light. Lighter than I thought possible. Holding her was like lifting someone in a pool. Sure, she was small, but how could anyone be that light? She clung to me like a baby koala to its mother, her teddy bear squished between our chests.

***

I ran through the woods, snow crunching under my feet. Once wed gotten far enough from the shed, I set the girl down. As I did so, her little hand grabbed mine in a vice-like grip. I forced a reassuring smile. I'd done a good deed. Now, I just needed to get her to the authorities. Child protection services ... the cops ... anywhere that could keep her father away. And I would have. I would have gone straight to help, if I hadn't felt the light tug, like that of a helium balloon, as we passed a park. She led me to the swing set, releasing my hand only once the other had grabbed hold of the chain. It was a dumbed-down version of what had been keeping her captive less than an hour before. An odd choice.

I pushed her for a bit, but as the sun began to set, I grew wary. Her father had surely returned to the shed by now and had realized shed escaped. Hed be looking for her, and I was sure the park would be the first place hed check. I stepped away, and motioned for her to follow. Instead, she clung to the swing set, her body trembling. A single hand outstretched towards me hesitantly. 

"I've got to get you someplace warm, okay? C'mon. We can't play anymore," I answered. 

She shook her hand, insisting I take it.

"Fine," I grumbled.

I took her hand half-heartedly, but the strength with which she held it made me realize she felt safe with me. I smiled and squeezed her tiny, delicate fingers. We took off towards the police station. Never once did she let go of my hand.

Then, it all fell apart. All because of me. Because of a stupid sneeze. I let go for just a moment. A split second, so I could cover my mouth. In the moment it took for my eyes to close and the air to torpedo out of my nose, the girl disappeared. I looked around me frantically. How could she have run away so quickly? I should have noticed it sooner, but when I did, it was too late. I looked at the snow to try and track her, but only *my* footsteps were present in the snow. There were two thin lines next to me, as though only the tips of her feet had touched the surface the whole time.

Something fell on my head. Something soft and squishy. Her teddy bear bounced off my forehead and landed at my feet. *No fucking way.*

I looked up.

She was floating, her body drawn towards the sky. Already, she was out of reach, yet her hand still extended down towards me, as though begging me to take it, to save her. Even as I jumped to try and bridge the distance, I failed to come close. It was like watching someone fall into a chasm in slow-motion. She started sobbing, tears falling like raindrops between the snowflakes. Her hand wiggled desperately, but she was already higher than the trees. There was nothing I could do. I wanted to save her. To go after her somehow, but I was chained down. Gravity was chaining me down to earth, like she should have been. I could only watch as she cried and floated up into the sky, helplessly begging for my help, until she disappeared behind the clouds.

***

Even to this day, on quiet nights, I can still hear her wailing cries echoing above. Somehow, shes still out there, cursing me for breaking her chains.

 Funny you should bring up Enigma of Amigara Fault, my sister showed it to me several years ago, and I was thinking about it this week and found the scans. o_o Coincidence? DUN DUN DUUUN.

It is such a freaky story. 




 That was captivating. 




 That's precisely what I'm trying to figure out, through careful observation. 




 It just so happens that I want to write a story about the eating habits of AMCs in their natural habitats. Time to get some binoculars. See you outside in the bushes, bud! :) 




 Truer words have rarely been spoken. 




 Maybe she bit her nails raw, and now she has to wait to grow them again. Hopefully she'll be back soon! 




 Yup! I don't dare ask about Rod, though. Counting myself lucky that they agreed to unshadowban Manen. 




 Thank you, Papa Fargold. :) 




 I am the ghost of Christmas past, come to tell you to be nice, lest your stockings be full of coals. 




 o_0 Eh? How on earth? 




 FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY ESPECIALLY FOOS LIKE ME WHO GREW UP WATCHING THE TV SHOW. :D 




 YES I AM EXCITED. 




 About a month ago, I broke one of the hinges off the cupboard above my computer at work. Since then, the door wont shut all the way. I called maintenance to fix it, but they warned me they had a massive backlog of calls and wouldn't be able to get to me any time soon. Sure, seeing the door perpetually ajar was annoying, but I thought it best to leave the work to the professionals. The last thing I wanted was another citation from the workers union for overstepping my bounds. Last time I had the nerve to fix a loose screw on my chair, they lost their shit. As long as it didn't threaten to fall on my head, I figured there wasn't any harm in waiting. It wasn't until my colleague went on vacation last week that I realized I was wrong. There was something in my cupboard that only came out when I was alone.

Having an office to oneself is probably every cubicle farmers dream. Privacy, space, and silence are things most people covet at work. Not me, though. In spite of being very high on the introvert scale, I have a need to be around people. I dont want to talk to or interact with them, mind you, but I find comfort in knowing others are around me. I also find it easier to concentrate when I *have* to make an effort to zone people out. Otherwise, I get distracted by ambient noise. Id only been alone in my office for a day, and already, I was feeling lonely. It wasn't just that the person sharing an office with me was gone, it was that almost everyone was away on vacation. I couldn't even hear people chatting about their weekend in the hallway, like they normally did. All I could hear was the clock ticking slower than on a Friday afternoon in high school, the sound of traffic outside the window, and tapping above my head.

Tap tap  

Tap tap  

Tap tap 

The tapping sound wasn't normal.

My eyes darted towards the cupboard in a hurry, fearing the door was about to fall on me. Thankfully, it was as still as a vegan pondering the moral implications of everything on lunch menu  when they *didn't* have someone there to complain to.

Upon tilting my head, I noticed something inside the cupboard. Through the dark crevice, I saw two brown eyes starring right at me. I nearly had a heart attack as I rolled away from my desk in a frenzy. A flurry of possible explanations flooded my mind: it was a prank, a plush toy, a photo, a trick of the light. As I contemplated the many possibilities, I saw the eyes blink, and then retract into the darkness with a scurrying sound. I tried to still my frantic heart by taking a few long breaths, but it was as successful as using a single pouch of sand to stop a flood.

I was terrified. If it had been a prank and Id been filmed, my reaction video would have gone viral. Here I was, an adult, freaking out over nothing.

Horses still galloping in my chest, I reached for the first solid object at my disposal: a large photo frame hanging on the wall. I'm not sure how useful it would have been as a shield *or* as a weapon, but holding the 11x17 wooden frame made me feel just a *bit* safer. Slowly and cautiously, I reached a trembling hand to the cupboard door. Swallowing saliva as thick as rubber cement, I pulled it open, readying myself for what might be inside.

The cupboard was empty.

Well, not completely empty. My gym bag, emergency clothes, and work-related books were all in their respective places, but that was it. No creepy teddy bear, no scary photo, and, more importantly, no monster. I let out a sigh of relief, and laughed at myself for getting so scared. *Youre just imagining things*, I thought. Yeah, imagining a pair of eyes in the cupboard. Why not? I closed the door as far as it would go, and went back to work. For the rest of the afternoon, I jumped at every snap of the building settling and every gust of air from the A/C unit. My eyes continuously checked the crack above my head while my body tensed to the point of making my neck stiff. I felt like a child afraid of an unclosed closet door at night. I was beyond happy when it was finally time to go home.

By the next morning, Id convinced myself that I was being silly. There was nothing in the cupboard. Heck, there wasn't even room for something to hide there anyway. It was business as usual for most of the morning, though as the day wore on, the feeling of loneliness came back. Even when he was around, it wasn't as though my office mate was chatty: we barely exchanged more than a casual hello and goodbye, but his absence still weighed heavily on me. I needed his presence, if just to hear his chair squeaking or his exasperated sighs whenever the boss emailed us. It was just so quiet without him there.

Tap tap  

Tap tap  

Tap tap 

I heard the light tapping sound above me. The hairs on the back of my neck turned to porcupine quills.

Tap tap  tap tap  

Tap tap  tap tap  

I looked up.

Tap tap  tap tap  tap tap  

Tap tap  tap tap  tap tap  

A hand. A shrivelled, rust-colored hand fingered out of the cupboard through the open crack. Its black, broken fingernails tapped against the polished surface in a rhythm that seemed to mimic my heartbeat. They moved faster as I pulled away and screamed a gut-wrenching scream.

TAP-TAP! TAP-TAP! TAP-TAP!

My heart pounded against my chest with the force of a crash test car smashing into a brick wall. To hell with logic, I reacted with pure instinct, leaping off of my chair so I could swing it towards the cupboard door. The hand retracted as I hit the surface, and pushed the door shut in one quick motion. The entire cupboard and its supporting structure shook wildly for a few moments, but then it stopped. I kept my chair over the door for as long as I could, until my arms tired, and I had to set it down. The broken door creaked open, but nothing came out.

I dont know whether it was bravery or stupidity, but I opened the cupboard to try and see who was inside. Once again, I found it empty, but for my belongings. I took everything out, and then checked every nook and cranny for an explanation. Whoever or whatever was messing with me had to have a point of entry. Maybe it was some homeless person living in the walls? I dont know. Id read stranger things. Try as I might, I couldn't find an opening. Everything was bolted in tight, not a loose panel in sight. *Fuck this*, I thought, gathering my things. I wasn't spending another minute in that office.

Come morning, I knew I had to go back to work. The boss would notice my absence. Still, I took precautions: I brought my tools to work. Union citation be damned, I was taking apart that cabinet. It took all morning, but I finally managed to dismantle the cupboard and its supporting structure, leaving only a bright white wall in its place. I piled the disassembled pieces on my colleagues side of the room, and went back to work.

Id love to say that thats how my ordeal ended, but it wasn't. You see, this morning, I came in to work again. At first, everything was perfectly normal. By noon, I was feeling lonely, but then, I heard something coming from my co-workers workstation. I wheeled myself over and saw that the cabinet pieces were missing. *The janitor probably threw them away*, I hoped.

As I turned back towards my desk, I noticed my recycling bin was shaking lightly. Had I accidentally hit it?

Tap tap 

Tap-tap  Tap-tap  Tap-tap 

The familiar, heartbeat-like sound filled my ears as I approached the bin, increasing along with my own beat. I began to quiver as I looked into the inside. Beneath unorganized stacks of discarded papers, I could see two brown eyes staring back at me.

I ran away, without even locking the door behind him.

Now I'm home, where its safe, quiet and alone. Where all I can hear is the TV in the background, and the tapping from the kitchen.

Tap tap

 There's a legend that says that, if you eat a forbidden fruit, you'll be devoured from the inside-out by the creature who made it. 




 I'm game. 




 I just might have to make her my wife! 




 EFF YEAH!!!!!!! 




 I think you might be turning into Quezacotl... 




 Stories about parasitic lice infesting green apples that, once eaten, turn the eater into Quezacotl. 




 This sounds awesome. I'm more into *listening* to the stories than *reading* them, so it's definitely not the job for me.

That said, if you ever want to hire someone to sit in the corner of your studio and hum non-stop for 12 hours a day, I'm your guy. I accept home-made rice crispies bars as payment. 




 Oh, you!

Nope, still very much ONTARIAN. 




 I can only answer this question as a handsome, well-mannered moose-riding Mountie Canadian.

The 4th of July is the day 'Murica had a huge tea party in Boston right after Christopher Columbus docked, bringing nice blankets for all the aboriginal people. His boat accidentally hit something, sending oil barrels ablaze, which is how they invented fireworks. Then, a bunch of dudes in red coats came in with spiky guns to try and help clean up the mess, but were attacked by bald eagles, led by Abraham Lincoln and John Handcock. Eventually, they wrote a few story ideas on a napkin, but Handcock sneezed in it, so they glued on a few extra napkin amendments to fix the paragraphs that got smudged by his nose-sludge. And THAT, my friend, is 'MURICA DAY. 




 I put the 'Man' in 'Manen'. ;D 




 Happy birthday, my 'murican buddies. 




 That's *one* way to teach your kid not to bite people. 




 In the depths of the Black Forest, creatures unknown to man lurk out of sight. Chances are, youll never see the monstrous lifeforms that haunt the labyrinth of ancient tree roots. That is, unless youre foolish enough to visit the forest on a cold winter night.

You see, there is *one* being in particular that has been spotted at the edge of the forest. They call it Mr. Tickler. Dont let its name lull you into a false sense of security: theres nothing innocent or whimsical about him. It is unknown exactly how many have fallen prey to him. People go missing in the woods all the time, whos to say Mr. Tickler isnt to blame for all those disappearances?

Few have encountered the creature, but those who have all describe the same thing: a tall man, an elongated and hooked snout, large insect-like eyes, bony arms, and fingers so long they drag on the forest floor. If youre not careful if youre too busy looking at its hideous face you wont notice those fingers stretching towards you, slithering over the grass like an army of snakes.

I saw him once, and I will never forget it.

Agatha was two years my junior, but she was the more adventurous of my siblings. On a quiet, moonless night, she had me follow her to the edge of the Black Forest. The forest floor was coated in half an inch of snow and a thin layer of fog hovered over the damp, leaf-covered soil. In the distance, I could hear something walking.

We should go back, I urged.

She laughed and tip-toed past the first line of trees, No way, scardy-pants! she replied.

Thats when I saw him. In the mist stood the horrendous creature my parents had warned me about. Its face was like a medieval plague doctors mask, it wore tattered robes made of tree bark, and its hooved feet dug into the ground with each step it took. I wanted to run to my sister, but my body wouldnt move.

Agatha, run! I shouted in panic.

She froze when she saw him, as though in a trance. I watched as its boneless fingers slowly approached. They ensnared her slowly, as though Mr. Tickler knew we wouldnt fight back. They began to wiggle, causing her to burst into a fit of laugher. Her head tilted back, tears streaming from her eyes as intense chuckles escaped her lips. Slowly, he began to drag her into the forest.

I remember the sound of her frantic, uncontrolled laugher echoing farther and farther away, until I heard an ear-piercing crunch. Then, nothing. Just wind in the trees.

If you find yourself near the Black Forest on a cold December night and hear laugher in the distance, then youll know Mr. Tickler has captured its next meal. If all is quiet, then you should run, otherwise he might come for you. 




 I get to go home?! With pleasure! :D I'll tell my boss that Tim Young told me I had to leave early.

He'll then look up and ask, "But  who is Tim Young?" 




 Don't you mean when the Dolphin is a**fin**? 




 The weirdest thing is that fact that they **can** show their support, regardless of whether or not NoSleep goes dark. NoSleep gives you the option of protesting if you want to, and not protesting if you don't.

Those who want to protest have a lot of options open to them: not generating content, sending a reasonably-worded email to the Reddit admins, failing to provide traffic to the website, etc. Reddit runs on user-generated content. If a million users stand up and say "NO!", it'll have a big impact. 




 Thanks for the warning, glorious steed. 




 I wonder if the tree's roots extend towards hell in a prayer the same way its branches extent towards the heavens. 




 Well, that's certainly one way to break the ice with a lady. 




 Cool! :O 




 [I found a tooth on a white sand beach](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3art1n/i_found_a_tooth_on_a_white_sand_beach/) 




 They definitely didn't go about it the right way. That's not how you build a good reputation. Quite the contrary. 




 I got the same message this morning and responded by telling them they should ask permission before posting stuff, though I'm unsure whether or not they'll heed that advice. 




 It was spelled with just one 's', which doesn't really surprise me. I've seen "Nite Clubs", "Breathe Rite Strips", and other such barbarisms in store/brand names. These guys -if they're real- used the correct spelling of the expression "Just deserts". 




 Happy Canada Day to my fellow Canadians! :D Go Canada, Go Canada. It's your birthday, it's your birthday! 




 Cake. Who would have thought you could be afraid of something as sweet and innocent as cake? I didn't think it possible, until I broke up with my boyfriend last month. Id endured months of emotional and psychological abuse before I finally mustered up the courage to leave him. In the weeks following our break-up, I started receiving threatening cakes, each with a message more disturbing than the next. Now, I'm sitting in a hospital bed, terrified of what the latest cake had to say.

Looking back, I'm not sure what I saw in Brad. At a bar, I overheard him ranting about the women hed slept with. He acted crudely, catcalling the waitresses and starring at the butt of any lady who dared walk in his line of vision. Judging purely by the pick-up lines he used and what little conversation I could hear, it was clear that he was no stranger to using foul language to speak to and about women. I know what it sounds like; you probably think I was a nave young woman who thought I could fix the proverbial bad boy. My attraction to him  if you can call it that  had nothing to do with such a childish thing. No, I wanted to beat him. I wanted to be the one that got away. The woman he thought he could woo, but who wouldn't give it to him no matter how much he begged. I wanted to take a stand on behalf of all the women hed wronged, and show him how much backbone the fairer sex really had. He was my opponent.

A simple wink and a wave was all it took to get his attention. He sent a drink my way, quietly approached, placed a hand on my shoulder, and leaned in to whisper a pick-up line so lewd and disrespectful, I dare not repeat it. I forced a giggle and playfully nudged him. My trap was set. The problem is, I was the one who ended up ensnared. It turned out that, after you got past the absolutely disgusting first layer of his personality, he was rather charming. One thing led to another, and we started dating. Before I even knew what had happened, we had moved in together. Thats when the abuse started. It was little things, at first. Accusing me of looking at other men, checking my text messages, telling me my clothes were too slutty, etc. There were so many signs I should have seen, but hindsight is 20/20. It wasn't as though it happened overnight. Brad progressively chipped away at my ego until I felt like a failure as a woman. I was afraid of living without him. He had me convinced that no man would ever want someone like me. Every time we fought, hed reel me back in with a grand gesture of some sort, and promises he never intended to keep.

Then, one day, we got into a huge argument over one of my co-workers. As usual, he called me every name in the book: slut, whore, skank  nothing was off-limits. Dishes were broken, holes were punched in the wall, and things were thrown. The situation took a drastic turn for the worst when Brad lifted his arm and backhanded me hard across the face. I fearfully retaliated by biting him, and ran out the door while he shrieked in pain. The first time he hit me was going to be the last.

I stayed at my mothers house for a few days while I tried to get my head back on straight. Id left everything behind: my money, ID, clothes, and even my phone. Fearing Brads wrath, I steered clear of our shared apartment until I was certain he was at work. Even then, I asked for a police escort in case he showed up. Judging by the fact that he hadn't thrown away my belongings, I deduced that he thought I was cooling off and would come crawling back to him any day now. He was dead wrong. While the officers waited patiently at the door, I took the essentials, leaving my furniture, decorations, and cookware behind. I wanted a fresh start, even if it meant having to re-purchase household staples.

Before long, I was moving into a fabulous new apartment across town. Rent was fair, the neighbors weren't snoopy, it was closer to my workplace, and, best of all, there were no memories of my ex. None of his toenail clippings, body spray, or stupid NFL memorabilia. I felt fortunate in my misfortune: starting over wasn't easy, but it was exactly what I needed.

***

Id just gotten settled for the evening, when the doorbell rang. The hallway was empty, but there was something waiting for me on the doormat: a plain white box without any identifying features, tied with a curled pink ribbon. I picked it up and brought it to the kitchen, examining it closely. Using a knife, I cut off the ribbons and opened the box. Inside was a vanilla cake with lavender-colored buttercream icing. Square in the middle of it was something written in dark purple script:

Welcome Karen!!!

For a split second, I thought it might have been from a neighbor. No, that couldn't be it. I hadn't had the chance to introduce myself yet. Besides, if the idea was to welcome me to the neighborhood, then surely they would have waited for me to answer the door so we could chat. Had my mom sent it? It wasn't really her style, so I called her, and she denied having knowledge of it. Perplexed, I searched the box for any clue, and found a business card for *Just Deserts Bakery*. On it was a ten-digit code, an address, and a phone number. I felt a pang of worry in my chest. What if Brad had sent the cake? Id been careful not to share my new address with anyone, but what if hed been following me? Anxiety began to bubble inside like the magma in a slumbering volcano. Nervously, I dialed the number listed on the business card to get some answers.

Once the call connected, a playful jingle tickled my ears. It was followed by what sounded like a grown woman talking in an obnoxious baby voice. You know, like on those kiddie shows where the host talks to kids?

Welcome to Just Deserts Bakery! We hope you enjoy your Just Deserts!

The tagline made me cringe.

Were sorry, but our store is closed right now. If you want to check the status of your order, type the 10-digit order number followed by the pound key, she continued, her voice still as annoyingly energetic.

I typed the order number on my card, heart racing. *Please not Brad, please not Brad, please not Brad*, I repeated in my head.

There was a slight pause on the line, and then the voice spoke again, Looks like you received our Super-Duper Vanilla Surprise, courtesy of- it began, but the sing-song tone was replaced by an ear-piercing robotic voice, anonymous.

*Well, that doesn't help me*, I thought, biting my fingernails as I nervously paced back and forth. I hated to let good food go to waste, but I was smart enough not to eat something that, as far as I knew, could have been laced with rat poison. If the sender eventually revealed himself as someone other than Brad, then I would lie through my teeth and tell them I loved the cake. If it was from Brad, then I was definitely not eating it, whether or not it hed sabotaged it. For my own peace of mind, I tossed the cake in the garbage bin, and went to bed.

I woke up the next morning feeling rejuvenated. As I walked through the kitchen, I could smell the sweet scent of cake rising from my garbage can, reminding me of my woes. *Brad knows where I live*, I worried. I went about my day, trying not to think about him. It was *my* life and *I* was in control. I didn't want to be a slave to his abuse any more, yet it was hard to stop hearing his disapproving words whispered in the back of my mind. *Youre not good enough. Youre a bitch. Button your top, you whore.* I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and tried to keep my head held high.

Another package was waiting for me when I got home. Same white box, same pink ribbon.

Enjoy your Just Deserts! it read, same as the bakerys motto.

The cake was different this time. Chocolate with cherry icing, or so the *Just Deserts Bakery* hotline claimed, when I called to check the order. I was surprised that they were still closed, but not shocked to find out that the order was sent anonymously. Chocolate was my favorite, so throwing *that* cake out was more painful than the first. Still, my safety was far more important.

The following day, another cake found its way onto my welcome mat. I didn't even have time to debate whether or not I should throw it out, because when I opened it, the message inside frightened me so much that the box slipped through my fingers, and the cake splattered onto the floor.

I'm going to slice you up like a birthday cake.

It was Brad. It *had* to be Brad. He was fucking with me, like the scumbag that he was. I called the bakery, but still couldn't get through to a human being.

Like clockwork, another package showed up on my doorstep the following day. This time, it contained four cupcakes, each with a different letter written in bold.

S-L-U-T

Lovely.

The next day at work, I called the bakery. I figured they closed early, and that Id be able to catch them during normal business hours. I had a hunch theyd refuse to reveal the name of the sender not that it wasnt blatantly obvious but I would made damn sure theyd ban my address from future deliveries. Hopefully, Brad would get the message and move on.

Welcome to Just Deserts Bakery! We hope you enjoy your Just Deserts! Were sorry, but our store is closed right-

Fuck! I shouted, tossing the phone aside.

That night, I had a date with an old friend from college. We had a pretty great time, and I ended up staying over at his place. When I tried to sneak out the next morning, I nearly tripped over a box on his front steps. *No way*, I thought. My hands shakily pulled the ribbons loose, and I peered inside.

Twinkle twinkle little whore, shut your legs, theyre not a door.

I recoiled in terror. Brad was *stalking* me. I knew it.

The abuse didn't let up. Every day, Id get home and another cake was waiting for me. Every damn day. Why? If he knew where I lived and if he was following me around, why hadn't he shown his face yet? Was he trying to torture me? Slowly drive me insane? He must have spent a fortune buying all those cakes, and for what? To scare me? If that was his intention, then it was working splendidly. I was terrified, looking over my shoulder and through my blinds every few minutes. Scared of every shadow I saw and every headlight in the window. It was only a matter of time before he made his move. Every day, Id get another horrible message. Fuck you, bitch, Good riddance, and my personal favorite, This is poisoned. *Subtle, Brad. Real Subtle*, I thought. I tried calling *Just Deserts Bakery* at various times of day, but no one ever answered.

Why did I even bother opening the boxes? I knew there was nothing good inside, just more abuse. More *Brad*. The scent of sugar infiltrated every corner of my apartment. I was sick of the odor. It was on and around me at all times. Even at work, I swear I could smell it.

***

Out of the blue one day, I got home and my welcome mat was empty. Relieved, I headed inside and relaxed for the first time in weeks. Maybe Brad had found a new plaything. I felt bad for whoever had to deal with him, but glad that he wasn't my problem anymore. I slept like a baby that night. That is, until a familiar scent woke me up in the early hours of the night.

My alarm clock read 3:57 a.m., its dim red light illuminating something large sitting on my bedside table. I squinted, my blurry eyes making out the outline of a white box. *Oh god, no*, I thought. I jolted to my feet, and turned on the lamp. Hed been inside my home. The message on the cake wasn't as rude as the others, yet it was somehow more unsettling than the profanity Id grown accustom to.

Youre beautiful when you sleep.

It was time to take matters into my own hands. I had the bakerys address, so I decided to head there right away. After all, bakeries were supposed to open early, right? Someone was bound to be at the store. I would explain my situation and, if they refused to cooperate, would threaten to involve police. Surely, they could get a warrant to figure out who was sending the cakes. I could have Brad arrested for harassment. I felt elated at the thought of finally being free. The law was on my side, after all.

It must have been around 5:00 a.m. when I pulled into the empty strip mall outside of town. My face twisted as I noticed the condition the building was in. It was in complete disrepair: walls had crumbled, the foundation was cracked, windows were broken, and store signs had faded away. *Just Deserts Bakery*, if it had *ever* been in the strip mall, was long gone. I couldn't even find a semblance of their logo on any of the store-fronts. When I got out of my car to peer into the broken building, all I could see were remnants of clothing stores and a bowling alley. There was nothing even remotely resembling a bakery.

Defeated, I headed back to my car. My heart sank as I opened the door. The sweet scent of cake came pouring out of the vehicle, emanating from a cake on the passengers seat.

Die, bitch.

My eyes scanned the area quickly, but I couldn't see Brad. Was he hiding in the back seat? I hadn't heard footsteps, but I wasn't really paying attention before. For a moment, I thought about hiding in the abandoned mall, but what if Brad was waiting inside to jump me? I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. I backed away from my car, whimpering like a child, and called the cops. I waited for ten whole minutes in the exposed lot, halfway between my vehicle and the building. If he was in the strip mall, then I would have time to flee to my car. If he was in my car, then I would have a head start when running away.

By the time the police arrived, I was feeling really light-headed. I think I was tiptoeing on the verge of a full-blown panic attack. The officers let me sit in their squad car while they checked every nook and cranny of my automobile. I watched nervously, expecting Brad to jump out at them with a knife. Thankfully, the car was empty. Once theyd deemed the area secure, one of the officers took me aside while the other contacted the station to put an APB out on Brad. I was relieved to see them take the death threat so seriously. The officer listened as I told him about the break-up, the harassing cakes Id been receiving since, and the break-in that morning. He retrieved the bakerys business card from the cake, which, by that point, was melting on the hood of my car. He gave the number a call.

Says it isn't valid, he told me.

Thats not possible, I replied.

I tried calling *Just Deserts Bakery* using my own phone. By then, I had their number on speed dial, since I called them more often than I called my mom. Sure enough, an operator told me the number was no longer in service. I became even more agitated. Brad had gone through an obscene amount of trouble to mess with me, it seemed.

After about ten minutes, the second officer interrupted, Mam, he said, tilting his head.

Still shaking, I nodded, Y-yes? I asked.

You say youre being stalked by Brad Clarkson, right? he asked.

I nodded again, Yeah

He frowned, We have a report that he committed suicide, mam.

Blood drained from my face. Had he run off into traffic after putting the cake in my car? The hairs on the back of my neck rose like soldiers at attention. As disturbing as the revelation was, at least it meant I was safe now. I wouldn't have to endure his harassment anymore. It was a bittersweet feeling, but I didn't want to celebrate too much. The last thing I needed was to arouse suspicion. If anyone had motive to murder Brad and make it look like suicide, it was me.

O-oh. Okay, I answered, H-how?

He turned around, exchanging a few words with the station, Gas from the oven. Its just like going to sleep, he answered.

I raised a brow. Something wasn't adding up. Brad lived an hour away from the strip mall. How could he have dropped the cake off, driven home, killed himself, been found dead, AND had a report filed about it?

There has to be a mistake. He was here an hour ago, I protested.

The mans lips wrinkled into an awkward frown, I'm sorry mam, but hes been dead for a month, he said.

*Thats impossible*, I thought, turning to the cake. My head was spinning. If it wasn't Brad who had been sending me these cakes, then who was it? I felt my breathing accelerate beyond control as a burning sensation ran down my spine.

Listen, mam, well get an undercover cop in your area, all right? suggested one of the officers, Well catch whoevers doing this.

I nodded nervously.

***

I felt more comfortable knowing someone was outside watching out for me, but my relief was short lived. The cakes stopped showing up at my home, but that didn't mean they wouldn't find their way to me one way or another.

During lunch one day, I heard my co-workers laughing wildly.

Whats so funny? I asked.

One of them pointed to a birthday cake on the lunchroom table.

Go ahead, eat some, fatass, it read.

I spotted the *Just Deserts Bakery* business card from a mile away, and quickly swatted a spoon out of a co-workers hand before he could take a bite. My colleagues looked at me as though I was losing my mind, but I didn't want any harm to come to them. I gathered the pieces of cake that had already been served, tossing them furiously in the trash bin, before doing the same with the cake. When I tried to explain myself, my co-workers refused to listen to me. One of them implied that I was being moody because of my cycle.

Sobbing, I drove home in a car that stunk of sugar. The scent made me nauseous. I could practically taste it now. If I wasn't already crying, the smell alone would have made my eyes water. I rolled down the windows, but it barely made a difference. By the time I got home, I had convinced myself to take the bus for a few days, just so I could get away from the stench.

***

Rain. I remember waking up to rain. My nostrils were pleased with the odor of wet pavement and squashed worms. I waited in the bus shelter, my legs swinging back and forth as I inhaled the natural aroma of soggy grass. My eyes closed for just a moment. A fleeting second, but as soon as they did, the humid air took on a completely different smell. It was like getting smothered by a box of cupcakes. My head slowly turned to the seat on my right. There it was. A cake.

Get well soon, Karen.

I whined and jumped to my feet, backing away from the dessert that was haunting me. In a frenzy, I failed to notice when my heel caught a crack in the sidewalk. I felt my body falling and heard the screech of tires. The world went black.

This morning, I woke up in a hospital room, surrounded by balloons and an array of beautiful flowers. I couldn't smell them over the stench of sugar that permeated my nostrils. There was a white box with pink curly ribbons waiting for me on the bedside table. Scrawled on the lavender-colored cake, in familiar dark purple script, were the words:

Enjoy your last meal.

 Oh no! Not a telephone! 




 Summer had always been my favorite season because the warm weather meant I could stop going to the sweaty gym at work in favor of the great outdoors. There was nothing I enjoyed more than cycling on the bike path along the river. Being the creature of habit that I was, I never strayed from the northbound trail. Yesterday, however, I was feeling adventurous, and went south instead. It was a mistake that I will never repeat.

It was a tremendously hot day, the kind where opening the front door felt like putting ones head in the oven. The moment I stepped outside, a wave of scorching humid air assaulted me, forcing me to reconsider my workout schedule. Wiping sweat from my brow, I retreated back into the safety of my air-conditioned home, and decided to wait until evening before heading out.

By 8:00 p.m., the sun's influence was weakening, and the temperature had become slightly more manageable. It was always cooler by the river anyway, so I figured Id be comfortable once I got there and had wind blowing on me. I took to my bike and rode to the municipal park where, as anticipated, the weather was a bit more agreeable.



As I arrived at the junction between the northbound and southbound trails, I spontaneously decided to head left, into uncharted territory. The southbound path was surprisingly pleasant, bringing me nearly to the edge of the water. To my left was a dense forest, whose trees shielded me from the remaining rays of sunlight. Unlike my usual route, this one followed an even mix of flat terrain and hills, providing me with a more balanced workout.  The best part was that, whether due to the weather or the time of day, I was the only person there that evening. It was wonderful: I could go at my own pace without being passed by weirdly competitive riders or having to dodge annoying rollerbladers who never stayed within their lines.

I had just reached the bottom of a hill when the atmosphere suddenly became dense and heavy, like I'd ridden into a tub of jello. At first, I thought I had hit a pocket of humidity, until I noticed the visual distortions. Everything began to warp, as though my contact lenses had been replaced with funhouse mirrors. In my peripheral vision, shadows were twisting and contorting, making them seem alive. A thick fog rolled in from the forest, engulfing everything around me and snuffing out the horizon. If not for an eerie twilight glow emanating from the river, I would have been left in total darkness.

"Don't stop! No matter what, don't stop or you'll die!" a woman shouted in the distance.

Was she talking to me? Who else could she have been speaking to? Id been riding for over an hour and hadnt seen a soul. Im not sure what crept me out more: the warning, the intense pressure, or the unusual optical illusions. Regardless, I wanted to turn back. I gripped my handlebars firmly and attempted to perform a U-turn on the narrow path. However, an unseen force kept my wheels fixed in one direction. Have you ever been in the saucer-shaped ride at the carnival? You lay, untied, to a vertical plank. The saucer starts to spin, pinning you against the plank for the duration of the ride. Thats what it felt like. Try as I might, I could not get my bike to budge because something was pushing my bike to the ground.


I hit the brakes softly, hoping to disembark and turn myself around manually. As soon as I slowed, a sense of dread pierced my heart like an arrow made of ice. The blurry shadows I'd been seeing at the edge of the forest suddenly made a beeline towards me. Their shapes became clearer as they approached. Hundreds of black, clawed fingertips skittered over the grass like giant spiders, leaving the turf yellow and brittle in their wake. The hands seemed both solid and liquid at the same time, as though they could change states on a whim. When they advanced, they did so with the fluidity of corn syrup, yet they still managed to dig themselves into the dirt as easily as a shovel. The hands were attached to narrow arms that extended from the forest like stretched-out bubble gum.

Horrified, I started pedaling, trying to put as much distance between the wretched creatures and myself. It was difficult: it felt like I was carrying three times my body weight in the thick air. It was like pedaling with the resistance maxed out, but without the rewarding boost. No matter how much effort I put in, I advanced mere meters in the effort required to cover a mile.

A low growl bellowed from the forest. Between the greenery, I could see something massive slithering along, following me. The appendages that chased me were all emerging from the single life form hiding behind the tree line. Sweat poured out of me as I desperately tried to pedal farther from its grasp, but exhaustion was quickly winning out over adrenaline. Each time I tried to slow my pace so I could catch my breath, the sickly dark hands threatened to reach me. I kept my eyes on the road ahead, hoping that, if I could just reach the end of the bike path, I would be safe. Unfortunately, it was like chasing a rainbow. Every meter forward pushed the horizon farther away.

It was only when my muscles started to cramp hard and my lungs became enflamed, that I finally gave up trying to run. I had given it all my might, pedaling for an eternity, to no avail. There was no fight left in me. The clawed fingertips came at me like vultures on fallen prey. Fingers shot up and clutched a handful of spokes on my back wheel. They instantly rusted and broke off. I knew I was going to suffer a similar fate. Aching with pain, I hopelessly closed my eyes and braced myself for my demise.

"Now! Run!" said the voice from before.

As though by magic, the overwhelming weight bearing down on me lifted. Gravity had returned to normal. The morsel of hope was enough to give me the strength to jump off my bike just in time to see it consumed by the hands. In seconds, it crumbled into a heap of scrap metal.

"Quick, into the water!" she urged.

I turned to the river, darted towards it, and plunged into the cool liquid while the arms gave chase. The hands stopped at the water's edge, skittering side to side hesitantly. Finally, they snapped back into the forest like elastic bands. I heard the creature scream an ear-piercing howl. The noise was so loud that it caused the water to ripple. I watched in shock as the monsters outline faded in the distance.

I turned to thank my savior, but what I saw made my stomach drop. She wasn't a person, that much I knew. Her head was minuscule and wrinkled, like a barbaric shrunken tribal head. Instead of hair, an uneven mass of kelp hung from her scalp, dangling in front of her pure white eyes. A thin, skin-like film sealed her mouth shut, but the jagged teeth it restrained could easily bite through the semi-opaque layer of flesh in a single chomp. Her half-submerged body was covered in moss, surely hiding horrors beneath. Her webbed hands clutched my shoulders, yanking me into deeper waters.

Screaming for bloody murder, I twisted and thrashed, trying to break free of her grasp, but I was already too weak to change my fate. My screams turned into gurgles as she pulled me underwater. I'd been so stupid to trust her: I was just a French fry shed wanted to steal from the other creatures plate.

It was only a matter of time before I drowned. You hear people talk about seeing their lives flash before their eyes in these kinds of situations. Not me. No, my thoughts drifted to very weird places. Mainly, I worried about how disgusting my cats litterbox was going to get in my absence, wondering how long it would take people to notice I was missing. A day? A week? A month? My house was going to be a mess. Had I vacuumed? Would people remember me as a slob?

Just as I was about to pass the threshold of unconsciousness, I remembered the pocket knife I carried in case of emergency. My numb fingertips caught hold of it, and quickly flicked the corkscrew out. With the very last of my strength, I jabbed the weapon into her hand.

"HYAAARRRGHH!" she screamed, pulling her arms back to nurse her wounds.

My mouth burst open and I inhaled, water pouring into my lungs. Everything went dark.

When I came to, I was on the shore miles away from my city. I'm not entirely sure how I made it back to the surface: whether I was helped, or just surprisingly more buoyant than I thought. I didn't question it, though. I was just happy to be alive, albeit in poor condition. You know that feeling you get when you go to the gym for the first time in years because you made a New Years resolution? That sore feeling in muscles you didn't know existed? I felt that, but ALL over. By the end of it, even my toe muscles were hurting.

I eventually got home, vowing never to take the southbound path again. Though, honestly, I think Ill stick to the gym from now on. 




 I feel like maybe *just maybe* letting a Coyote eat your spirit animal (and your heart) wasn't *exactly* the best idea... 




 That's a neat idea. You should try your hand at writing it. 




 I RPed on AIM when my preferred place was having server issues and/or when someone was having trouble logging in. Ah, those were the days. 




 I've never actually seen that phrase in a story, but if I ever did, I would definitely click out of it. o_0 




 Thank you so much! :) 




 They INSULTED you? Holy cow.

I would highly recommend recording your calls moving forward. I use [ACR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.acr hl=en), a free call recorder.

Anything a representative of Bell tells you by phone is **legally-binding**, even if another agent says otherwise. It'll be a **lot** easier to get your point across if you have a recording of your exchanges.

For instance: John Mc.Johnville tells you you're going to get reimbursed. After two months, you realize Bell still hasn't refunded you. You call them, and Mr. Paul Managerman tells you John wasn't authorized to make such a promise and they can't fulfill it. Well, too bad Paul. John, a representative of your company said it, and you are legally-bound to abide by it.

I bring this up because I had some pretty serious issues with Sears last year and was forced to record my calls to protect myself and force them to respect their agreement. It took 9 months and an email to all the CEOs and chairs of Sears, but eventually, I got my money back.

**Important note**

For legal purposes, if you record calls, you must:

1. Inform the person they are being recorded.

2. Tell the person *why* they are being recorded.

3. Offer a non-phone alternative, IF they refuse to be recorded.

Basically, once they pick up the phone, just say: "Hi, please note that this call is being recorded for documentation purposes."

That's all. If they refuse, offer to communicate by email. The important thing is to have a paper/audio trail. 




 OK, this isn't one of MY photos, but whiskey tango foxtrot is going on [here](http://img.xooimage.com/files87/4/a/e/crinof-36e59a0.jpg)?! It's a piece of art I came across today called "The Bachelor's Dream".

WHAT'S WITH THOSE DOLLS?! THOSE CREEPY DOLLS. WHAT THE HELL? 




 Sounds like *you're* the Quebecor here.

As for me, I'm not a big fan of fries, and I don't like cheese. The combination of them is certainly not going to appeal to me. 




 ;____; I DON'T EVEN LIKE POUTINE!

I'm an Ontarian! My  uh  heart is shaped like Trillium?
