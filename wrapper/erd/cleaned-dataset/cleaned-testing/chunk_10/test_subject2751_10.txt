 I find the Little Prince a very cutthroat game sometimes! 









 Obligatory **Castles of Burgundy** and **Trajan** since you like Feldian games.

You can try out **Tzolkin** on boardgamearena before making a decision.

**Panamax** doesn't work well with 2. 




 I don't think an outsider could do anything much about a sore loser really, except maybe play low conflict or co-operative games. 

Maybe keep reminding them, one way or another, that game groups only exist when everyone is having fun.  




 Fields of Arle actually gives a very different feel from Agricola. If you enjoy the resource management, progression in technologies and personal farm with a relatively low stress level, then Fields of Arle would be a good game for you - there's basically no food pressure. If you enjoy the high stress level, competing for action spaces, and synergising with cards, then Agricola is still the better option. 




 Decent week for me:

**The Voyages of Marco Polo** x 2 - You know a game is good when you still look forward to the next play after losing badly.

**La Granja** - Interesting mix of mechanics and almost abstract farming. 

**Arboretum** - The cards look nice and rules are simple. A decent filler for me.

**Kraftwagen** - Quick playing action selection game that is surprisingly cutthroat. However, the research cards somehow is a bit too random.

**Nations** - My second play. I'm usually a fan of resource management games but  I don't really enjoy this one. For its length, it is too punishing for someone who lags behind, random cards in the new age makes it more tactical/take-that than strategic, and the feeling of progress across ages is just incremental as you are constantly tearing down old buildings. Not sure I would want to replay again.

**Evolution** - Pretty neat idea and simple to play. 

**Pandemic: Contagion** - Mediocre light cube pushing game. I don't feel like I'm making meaningful choices in the game. 




 Have you tried **Quartermaster General**? It's a fast playing 3 vs 3 WWII game that plays under an hour. Easy to pick up, varying player powers for the 6 countries, and surprisingly each game plays out quite differently. 




 Yes. I was in the exact same position as you last year. I live in the UK and ordered from amazon.de. Just print the rules from bgg. 




 you spend more time thinking about board games than actually playing them. 




 Nice collection! We share a lot of similar taste in games. If you are looking for any new games, I'd recommend **Roll for the Galaxy**, **Elysium**, **La Granja** and  **Voyages of Marco Polo**. 




 I'm a cult of the "new", not in the sense of games that have just released, but in relations to learning new games. I like learning mechanics that are new to me, appreciating clever subtle designs, and discovering  strategies. When playing "old" games with standard strategies, I sometimes find myself on auto-pilot mode. Perhaps I belong in a subset of Cult of the New called **Cult of Discovery**. 




 Probably good enough for a collection oriented towards low conflict family games. Great for introducing someone to modern board games (see **Catan**, **Ticket to Ride**, **Hanabi**, **Carcassonne**, **Dominion**). However, there will be many types of games the collection will never reach: games with high conflict, games with high stress level and strategy, and games with deceit. 




 Have you tried **Game of thrones the board game** or **Kemet**? Each player is dealt a hand of cards with different values/attributes, symmetric in Kemet and asymmetric in GoT. The twist is that the cards you use are temporarily discarded and only come back to your hand until you have spent your last (or penultimate, can't remember) card. Therefore, you have to pick your battles. 




 I taught Marco Polo to about 10 different players. I love how each time I hear how their initial reaction being "this is super powerful, how is this not broken" then after playing switches to "this is actually quite difficult to use". 




 A fruitful week!

**Voyages of Marco Polo** x 4. Tried out another 4 of the characters, making each game feeling very different. And most importantly, every single player that I have taught the game to enjoyed it too.

**La Granja** x 2. A Feldian farming game! Love the multi-use cards and range of flexibility that this creates. Excited to try out more strategies from the different helpers.

**Roll for the Galaxy** - I love games with low down time so I'm certain this will remain one of my favourite short games.

**Pictomania** - Great fun, especially when players think of abstract and creative ways to draw! Loved the table talk too.

**Dungeon Petz** - a great example of a thematic Euro. Rewards careful planning and risk management. The bidding bit was probably my least favourite part, but it was always fun to make up back stories to the pets you have, which appeals to a group of players who usually couldn't care less about theme.  




 I would say it's quite realistic. I've played a fair bit (30+ games), and in 4p games usually at least 1 player manages to form a 3rd town. Obviously not as likely in 5p games.
Examples of my own:

[Dwarves](http://terra.snellman.net/game/emanova3)

[Mermaids + Darklings](http://terra.snellman.net/game/4pLeague_S6_D7L25_G3)

[Mermaids + Nomads](http://terra.snellman.net/game/4pLeague_S7_D6L24_G7)

[Nomads + Witches](http://terra.snellman.net/game/4pLeague_S7_D6L24_G5)

[Swarmlings](http://terra.snellman.net/game/4pLeague_S6_D7L25_G7)

[Halflings](http://terra.snellman.net/faction/4pLeague_S6_D7L25_G4/halflings/)

[Witches](http://terra.snellman.net/game/4pLeague_S7_D6L24_G2)        

Tips:

* It's easier for certain races (Nomads, Witches, Mermaids, Riverwalkers, Yetis)
* Be prepared to lose a fair amount of points (10) throughout the game for power leeches.
* 3 towns =/= win, as you can see from my examples.
* Try to avoid spending 3 workers to dig as much as possible.
* Sometimes you have to pass early to secure the bridge next turn. 




 Ranked by my preference:

**The Voyages of Marco Polo** - Best Euro of 2015 to date. I give credit to the designer's bold choice of radically different player powers. This will be in the top 100 on BGG very shortly.

**Clash of Cultures** - Rock solid tech tree in a civ game. I can see multiple viable strategies. Too bad I always suck at military and defending.

**Kraftwagen** - Neat action selection mechanism in a light Euro setting. I was initially worried about the imbalance of the research cards, but it didn't turn out to be that bad - some suggest a variant of revealing 3 cards instead of 2.

**Goa** - Very interesting bidding system and tech tree. The luck element was slightly annoying in an otherwise fine Euro.

**Patchistory** - Another civ game with a nice patching minigame. The auction mechanism is interesting but it dragged out the game as the bidding process could be quite slow.

**A fake artist goes to New York** - Awesome party game for the end of the night. Probably the best 2,000 yen I spent. 

---Dividing line between good and mediocre games---

**Nations the Dice Game** - Scratches the itch for a 45 minutes light dice driven drafting game. Nothing innovative here so it is not as replayable as **Roll for the Galaxy**.

**Criminal Dance** - a silly party game for non-gamers. Probably more fun with family and children.

**Temporum** - Not particularly interesting card game. Usually there's only one logical choice on your turn. 




 That's an interesting mix - I have to say it's rare to see players enjoying both Terra Mystica and Elder Sign.

As for Mage Knight, I'd recommend playing it solo at least twice before teaching other players. You will still inevitably get some rules wrong, so even then I recommend playing the co-op version as the first multiplayer game. Oh but it will be a very satisfying and rewarding experience at the end. 




 If your group has a website (e.g. meetup), it's useful and efficient for players to just prearrange a game. 




 **The Voyages of Marco Polo** - definitely the highlight of the week. At first there seems to be nothing revolutionary about the game: resource management, worker (dice) placement, route building with secret objectives etc. However, the radically different player powers changes the game entirely. Plus bonus points for variable setup! I can see myself playing 10+ games of this by the end of the year. Instant favourite of 2015.

**Fields of Arle** - Solid resource management game for 2. However, it doesn't feel too competitive, as even in the rulebook it says that this is a "development game". Too much of a sandbox for me. Still prefer Agricola.

**Clash of Cultures** - Awesome civ game. I do love the tech tree, but same as every other Civ game, I lose because I was too trusting to my opponents.

**Glen More** - A light Euro that plays within an hour. Probably best with 3 or 4 as you can plan ahead a bit. Too chaotic with 5.

**Agricola** - A 2p teaching game. Ended up with 53-40 with the help of Woodcutter, Market Woman and Stone Tongs.

**Temporum** - A mediocre card game where players try to be in the right place at the right time....and drawing the right cards. 




 Wow! Really looking forward to this. Stronghold games has become my favourite publisher. Lots of solid euros: **Kanban**, **Panamax**, **La Granja**, then **504**.
