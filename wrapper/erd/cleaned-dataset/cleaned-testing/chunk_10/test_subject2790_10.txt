 You have such a way with words.  




 SO of a shy guy here. He's missed this thread so I'll tell the story.

We lived together in the same halls, after a couple of weeks texting back and forth (nothing too flirty just silliness) a crowd of us went into town. The girls went to one club and the boys to the club next door. We were texting the entire night, much to the vexation of my flatmates.

When the clubs shut and everyone was rounded up a few of us went to the nearest kebab shop for a drunken scran, my food of choice was chips and cheese. Once back at the flat I wolfed down that glorious greasiness amid slagging from my friends.

My flatmates, frustrated at the tension between me and SO, sent us both into the corridor under the instruction we weren't allowed back in until we'd kissed. I was pretty hammered that night, and decided to myself "fuck it" and kissed him. 6 years later we're still together and planning our wedding.

/u/hoboharty this sound about right? 




 It sucks that the Citalopram didn't work for you but glad to hear your other meds are helping. It's my first time on antidepressants so I didn't know what to expect in the way of side effects. 




 Glad to know :) just glad I'm not working for the next couple of weeks. Feel like I'm on a different planet half the time haha. 




 Thanks, I've been reading online about some of the side effects but hadn't anticipated them coming this quickly. I've got another appointment with my doctor in a fortnight so if it's not starting to ease then I'll go over my options.  




 Not sure about official definitions but this is how I define them:

Fancy dress - generic costume e.g. wolf, mermaid, witch,

Cosplay - dressing in costume as an established character e.g. Teen Wolf, Ariel, Wicked Witch of the West
