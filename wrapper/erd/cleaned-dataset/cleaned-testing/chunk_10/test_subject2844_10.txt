 Haha! 




 Hahah I'm going to be looking over my shoulder a little bit tomorrow. 




 How come? I'd love to hear your thoughts. 




 Haha I agree. It definitely seemed liked it was set in the past. 




 I would definitely agree with you on that. I also wasn't ever horrified watching the movie. Like I said, I thought the movie created a sense of dread in me while I watched. The score was very original and added to the creepiness of the entire movie experience. 




 I just saw this movie today and I can't shake the feeling of dread I got from it. The concept of the movie was very original and I thought the movie, for the most part, was well made. Most scary movies these days rely on the jump scares or go overboard with the gore, however It Follows relies on something different. The thought of someone or something continuously walking towards you with the gravest of intentions was certainly unnerving. Has anyone else gotten the chance to see it? What did you all think?

 Kindred spirits man! The Simpsons game was definitely our other top favorite. I can't even imagine how many quarters we spent playing our way through those two games. I'm feeling so nostalgic right now, I might need to peruse Ebay for those. How much have you seen them cost in your research? 




 This is honestly an incredible summary. Thank you very much! 




 The best was the Turtles in Time arcade game. My brother and I used to bring a few rolls of quarters and play that game all the way through to the end.
