 Or at least the best pickled herring you can get in Indiana. 














 I make curried butternut squash risotto. Fusion is awesome. I'd try, too. 




 Bake like crazy.

You can also freeze some, but it doesn't last forever that way. I made the mistake of eating some that had been in the freezer for ~15 months and got food poisoning. Jsyk. 




 A serving is only one breadstick? How? Why? Life is unfair. 




 I've found it's also cheaper to buy blocks and shred as needed. Plus you get a mini work out every time you need cheese (which is all the time). 




 Glad it came through! 




 Hopefully sent (Dominos gift card). 




 We have them here in Indiana, too. Probably my favorite chip flavor ever, 




 My orange boy is named Bill, after the Weasley, obviously. Looks like they both have a lot of paw to grow into. 




 Indiana. And apparently our laws aren't even close to the worst in the country. 




 Where do you live that you can stay out that late? All bars here close at 3, cuz you can't buy any alcohol between 3 and 7am. 




 You're the only person outside my family I've ever seen to call this dish a one-eyed Egyptian. Therefore, you are now officially a member of my family. Congrats, OP! Most of us are functional in our alcoholism! 




 Thanks! 




 Thank you! 




 Basic recipe:

Slice an eggplant into ~1/2 inch rounds. 

Lay the rounds on a couple layers of paper towels, liberally salt both sides, cover with a couple more layers of paper towels, and let sit for at least an hour.

After some liquid is drained off, rinse the rounds.

Dip the rounds in beaten egg and then a combination of corn meal, shredded parmesan, garlic powder, and pepper.

Place rounds in greased pans, then into a 350 F oven for ~10 minutes, flipping once, so they get crispy.

In (ideally) a 13x9 baking pan, layer tomato sauce, eggplant, parm, and slices of mozzarella until you've used all your supplies.

Bake in 350 F oven for 25-35 minutes, until eggplant is cooked through and cheese is melty and browned.

Notes:

I used corn meal because my partner in crime has Celiac, so we try to be gluten free.

I used my Dutch oven because I don't have a 13x9 pan, but it was still wonderful.

Making your own tomato sauce would make this even better, but funds and time meant we had to use store bought. Garlic and herb would be great, but we used 4 cheese.

Next time I'd add some herbs, but it slipped my mind.

Edit: I never measure, but about half a block of each type of cheese was used, and we only used one big eggplant. It put 3 of us into food comas. 









 Panini press because I'm lazy. 









 I used to do that all the time, too. But then I cut 14" off. 




 I live in an apartment building. I have been in the same apartment for almost 2 years, and will be staying for a third year.

He moved in last August. He's in the complex across the alley from me. We've been flirting for a year. He's living there again next year.

I've left notes on his door and we've hung out a few times. He knocked on my door yesterday after I left a note and then was too scared to face him for a week. I'm freaking out because he actually wants to get drinks on Saturday, but I'm broke. And I think I'm in love with him. And I have no idea what to do. 




 Making that hair would be so fun. 




 Hope you don't like sausage. 




 It looks like you're increasing too fast. You can't add too many increases in each round. Sadly, I think you will have to frog, but not too far.

Best way to make a flat circle (at least that I've found) is to decrease the number of increases per round by 1, if that makes sense. Like, first round, increase in each stitch, then every other, then every third, etc etc. 




 Mmmm, pickled herring is the best. 




 I think that was because of the tapioca flour. They were perfectly cooked, just a little light. 




 Chips were just thick cut and baked with salt and pepper.

Fish was fairly cheap tilapia coated in tapioca flour, salt, and pepper, then deep fried.

Tapioca flour works really well for fried things. We used it because my partner in crime has Celiac. We just had lemon juice and ketchup with it, because I don't like tartar sauce and she isn't a fan of malt vinegar. Next time we will definitely be trying mushy peas to be traditional, this time one of the people for whom we cooked is a pea hating heathen (but I love her). 









 Was it alive? If not, it can't hold a candle to gagh. 




 Okay, I was confused there for a bit. Phew, I haven't been pronouncing it wrong. 




 Wait, does Heinz rhyme with beans across the pond? Or here? Have I pronounced it wrong my whole life? 




 Recieved 




 Recieved!

My fridge died over a week ago, and it finally got replaced yesterday. I'm totally broke because I've had to buy every meal, and even my ramen got thrown out. I'm in Bloomington, Indiana, and some Papa John's would really help me out. 




 Will? Or just someone with the same porch who also just had a birthday?

 Crazy easy and fast! 









 Reminds me of my [big Mr. Bill](http://www.imgur.com/N3EjiuY.jpeg) .

I went to the shelter with the intent to adopt, and he climbed right into my lap. 




 Second row from the bottom, third square from left: how did you do that? Did you work two strands at once, alternating which one you used for each cluster? I've never seen a granny square like that. 




 This style is amazing! And perfect, I think, but I'm not OP. 




 I'm from the Midwest. Last time I tried them, though, it was in CA. Still icky. 




 I hate avocados. In every dish. 




 I'm the opposite, I don't think I'll ever do amigurumi. I made one years and years ago because I got extra credit for it, but it's just not my thing. But, I love making blankets and clothes. Maybe, if I found the perfect pattern, I'd make an amigurumi, but I doubt it. 




 I use Tupperware or my backpack. No shame. 




 Not OP, but I've been working on the giraffe by the same person. Each motif takes probably 30 minutes max (I can do 2 for each episode of Star Trek on Netflix). I still have to finish all the motifs, but I'll bet that joining is the hardest part, especially because I'll have to sew a lining for mine. 




 Rally's. The bacon road house with fries on the sandwich and strawberry Fanta. 




 Hyperbole is his favorite thing in the whole world ever. 




 I do, too. Which is why my babies are named Kate and Bill. 




 Beautiful! I'm happy to see that I'm not the only person who uses Bobby pins as stitch markers, too. 




 Omg, New favorite sub! 




 I'm sure you know the basics (wrap yarn around your fingers or a book so many times, slip off, tie round the Middle, cut). How did you mess yours up?

If they weren't round enough, you can trim each strand to work. If they fell apart, get a friend to help make sure the knot is tight enough, and triple knot at least. If they look like a bunch of strands tied together instead of a pompom, wrap the yarn around a few more times. 




 Ravelry will be your best friend. As for color changes in the same row, look up tapestry crochet.

Once you know how to work two strands at once, graph paper will help you draft your own patterns. Each square is a stitch and each row is, well, a row. 




 All the pentagons are done, half the hexagons are, then a few more shapes. I'd be done by now if I hadn't run out of the magenta, and weren't broke. 




 Actually a teacher. 









 Do you have a pattern? My mom would go crazy for this! 




 That's why I have some favorites for background noise. All Star Trek, The West Wing, Bomb Girls.

Edit: or you could follow my strategy: learn every language. All of them. Japanese for anime; Arabic for the Qur'an; French for great movies; Russian for Tolstoy....

But I may just be a crazy person, since I'm sad that I'm only almost tri-lingual at 22...... 




 ..... Why Stalin?

I stopped after the round that starts with a ch11, then took one ch out of each decrease round. I then made the brim with 2 rounds of fpdc/bpdc. 









 Maybe our laws are less crazy because we have to deal with the fact that we live in fucking Indiana. 




 The liquor stores here in Btown aren't open past 11pm, but the Kroger can still sell until 3am, since it's 24 hour. 




 I usually go on Saturdays, I just thought what I had left would tide me over. 




 But I don't need another reason to move to the Great White North, except for the fact that I hate snow. 




 Idk if liquor stores have to be state run here, but you can't buy any,even at bars, between 3 and 7 am.

You don't happen to be from Pennsylvania, do you? That seems to be one of the few places with even crazier laws than Indiana. 




 That's (I think) also true in CA, where my sister lives. 




 IN also has the strange law that no grocery store can sell cold beer. They're hard core enough that they take sixers into the back of the store to warm up in January, so they won't still be cold from the trucks that delivered them. 




 You can't buy alcohol between 3 and 7am, and none on Sunday after 3an Saturday night. None till 7am on Monday , 




 Nearest one is a mile away. I don't have a car, and they're already closed. #alcoholicproblems 




 I just want to get a six pack, but Jesus apparently says that I can't. I could find someone to drive 20 minutes to a winery to get a couple bottles, but a) I'm budgeting for 2 handles this week and food, b) the winery is already closed, and c) everyone I know who has a car is also already too drunk to drive.

Jesus made wine out of water. Why does this bass-ackward state have to have these fucked up laws?

Edit: I guess I'm lucky. I thought IN had fucked up laws, 




 I get motion sick on a plane or in a car, even if I have blinds up. My sister has it worse, as she gets it without trying to focus on a fixed object, like a book. It sucks, but so it goes. 




 She actually was looking at her favorite toy, which was also in my lap. She was only upset because I wouldn't play fetch with her, because she's a very strange cat. 














 Absolutely gorgeous, and congrats!

I'm with /u/munchytea I don't even own a working sewing machine anymore, but I'd kill for that dress form. 




 So jealous of people who can crochet while in a car or on a plane. I get so sick. Yet I'm fine doing it on a boat. 




 Breakfast food always makes sense. 




 Basic recipe. I know it isn't at all traditional, but I'm a poor college kid.

Ingredients:

Pork loin

Dry rub (we used salt, pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, and onion powder)

1 bottle hard cider (we used Harpoon, but anything that is a bit sweet will work)

BBQ sauce

Instructions:

Rub your meat down with your rub, let sit for at least 30 minutes.

Pre heat oven to ~190F.

Put meat in a Dutch oven. Pour cider all over and around meat.

Cook, partially covered, until the internal temp is around 150. This took us around 6 hours.

About 2.5-3 hours in, start basting the meat with the cider that's in the pan every 30 minutes.

About 90 minutes before the meat is done, take the cover off and start basting with BBQ sauce every 15-20 minutes.

Take meat out of Dutch oven, let rest for at least 30 minutes. Then, shred with two forks.

Since we used a loin, we had to simmer the shredded meat and extra fat in about half of the braising liquid and some more sauce for 45 minutes to make it moist.

Serve on buns with whatever sides you want. We had mac and cheese and corn on the cob. 









 It could also be a weather alert. 









 I'm gonna have to show this to my friend. I just taught her some basics, and this is her favorite color combo (and mine, too). 




 Moogly is my favorite! 




 I'm honestly not sure if I can trust someone who thinks jumping out of a plane is a good idea. But I'm debilitatingly afraid of heights. 




 Mine just climbs on my back and knocks over my water. 




 Ma'am, good sir. Thank you. 




 Obligatory inside pics, no flash and flash. Was a tiny bit over done, but amazing, considering two of them was less than $8.

Ninja edit: paired with plain old criminis in butter and a cheap cabernet sauvignon. 




 Good luck!
Thanks, it was just criminis, butter, garlic powder, salt, and a little water to deglaze. 




 I love that, plus Italian Seasoning, on an everything bagel. Bagel of Doom. 









 It was toast with laughing cow garlic and herb cheese, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Literally the only food I have besides rice and ice cream. My body could only handle so much. 









 Congrats, man! I've still got one more year! 




 Made with water, not milk. Really, I just wanted oatmeal but can't afford it till Friday. 




 Obligatory first gold post. Thanks, bruh! 




 Nope, IU. 




 We had Kroghetto, but now it's Krogentrified. 




 Yup, Btown representing, only old people call it Krogers. 




 Southern Indiana here, I've only ever heard old people call it Krogers. 









 If peanut butter syrup were a thing, that would be the best thing in the world. #Yesistartedputtingpbonoreosafterisawtheparentrap 




 I also thought about the fact that dried herbs tend to be more potent than fresh ones, but I may be completely wrong. 









 I brewed random herbs into tea all growing up, since my mom is an avid gardener.

Monarda didyma, with the beautiful deep red flowers was a favorite of mine. It really worked with lavender, too. Lemongrass also makes a great infusion. Straight lavender or chamomile are also good, and exploring all the different varieties of mint is a great starting point (chocolate mint and peppermint are my favorites).

Edit: these all grow very well in Southern Indiana. I always just plucked Monarda flowers and boiled them in water for a few minutes, although I'm sure drying them would make the flavor more intense. 




 I learned to love spinach because its was "green food," so I could pretend to be one of the dinosaurs from Land Before Time.  Weird kids make the best adults. 




 Thanks! I'm waiting until the end of the semester to hunt for good loose teas in my town, but I'll keep this in mind. 




 I'm just getting into tea. I got my first stove top kettle yesterday, and will be getting an infuser soon.

How important is water temperature? And how can you tell that your water is the right temperature (I can only tell "cold," "almost boiling," and "boiling")?
 
Right now I only have a couple black teas (Earl Grey and a ginger peach flavor) and a couple herbal "teas" (chamomile and peppermint), all in bags.  




 He never called it a Philly Cheesesteak. Just a steak sandwich. 




 Plain, old, cheap chamomile with lunch, the last of my really really shitty Lipton style black tea bags later, cuz I've got a late night engagement that I need to stay up for.

Also, hi all! Brand new here, I'll be asking a lot of questions soon, once I finally get a kettle, infuser, and more than one mug. 




 I'm also new here, but I'd say ask. My favorite tea to ice is Bigelow Constant Comment, which is black tea with orange and cloves and other spices. It's the only tea I prefer with sugar, and it makes the best sweet iced tea.

 Ooh, I like that idea! Thanks! 




 Thanks!

Edit: my friend cut it last night when we were both wasted. Almost 14 inches got cut. 




 Background: I got about a foot cut off last night. I'm growing out the bangs I've religiously trimmed every 2 weeks for 3 years. 

I've been dying my hair with henna for just shy of 8 years, but am looking for a color change. I know that red suits me, even though my natural color is the definition of mousy brown. I haven't ever bleached my hair, and have only dyed it unnatural colors twice (all purple about 11 years ago, navy blue tips about a year after), but wanna go crazy, since I'm graduating college next May.

I'm sorry if this isn't the best picture, but I only have my phone.
