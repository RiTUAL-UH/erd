 Thanks. I get where she's coming from somewhat. I just want this to be resolved one way or another. If she doesn't want me around I can put it out of my head, if she does want me around great, but the different reactions each time I see her is getting tiresome. She probably won't want to talk about it face to face, do you think just texting her to initiate the conversation will work?  




 This is true, I mean we'll probably see each other sometime this week. It's just at this point a relationship probably isn't going to happen so I'm not getting my hopes up. I'd just settle for things not being weird and us being consistently one way or another.  




 Well it's been going on for over a month I think she knows how I feel about it. Do you think giving it some space this week might help and then gauge it for the next time we see each other? 




 What do you think I should say. Would shooting her a text be alright? I don't want this to be a high pressure thing. It's going to be uncomfortable obviously, but I think she'd just try to avoid the uncomfortableness if I tried to get her to meet up. Maybe I should just wait out the week. 




 This situation with this girl I was seeing before the holidays has gotten pretty complicated since we got back to college. Early in November this girl couldn't spend enough time with me, whenever she was free from work or school she wanted to do something or was texting me. She was getting very emotionally invested in me and I got invested in turn (we were dating pretty seriously) We were starting to have 'relationship talks,' and she confided in me about her problems with anxiety and sometimes depression. We stayed over at each other's places, I met her friends and roommates she met mine. I wasn't someone she was trying to hide.  

Then it was like a switch flipped in her head and she decided to be really cold and standoffish with me. We were still hooking up and seeing each other, but it just seemed like she didn't really want me around as much. By middle of December she had me doing the chasing and when we got back from Holidays she broke it off. She just told me she's having a hard time and is completely emotionally unavailable, but still likes me. 

We see each other pretty regularly because we work at the campus bar together, but things are weird. Some nights she actively avoids me, or acts uncomfortable around me and other nights she responds to being flirty and teasing. 

There was a night a last week where we were hanging out in a group at the bar listening to music and just hanging out. I was talking about a show I'd played that weekend with my band and she got upset with me that I hadn't invited her. I also haven't been texting her, because every time I've asked her to hangout she's been busy or 'busy' and she never initiates texting anymore. She asked me to hangout longer when I thought about leaving. Later when we were alone for a minute she was giving me this pouty face and I asked her how she was doing. She just said terrible and looked me in the eyes, so I kissed her and she reciprocated really aggressively. Like push me against a wall making out. We only got interrupted by a friend bumping into us. 

I asked her to hangout over the weekend and she told me she had a lot of work to do (plus she works weekends so I don't know). She does seem to be back to avoiding. She talked to me for all of a minute at a party we were both at the other night and just hovered around her friends. When she's acting cold/uncomfortable I just give her space and kind of pretend she's not there. I know I should just let the whole thing go, I'm honestly a bit hung up, but I'd like to clear the air with her so we can stop awkwardly avoiding each other like we are now. 

What do you think? Should I go ahead and just talk to her about it? I just want to ask if we've just decided on being weird with each other now. I haven't been this confused about a girl in a long time, so any advice is appreciated.

**tl;dr**: I was seeing a girl before the holidays, and it seemed like we were moving into a relationship. She admits to having anxiety issues. After the break she tells me she's emotionally unavailable and can't date right now. She's been bouncing back between avoiding me and being very affectionate when I'm around. I don't want to awkwardly avoid each other anymore because it sucks and is much more uncomfortable.  




 I'm an INFP male and I always feel a little outside of the modern gender dichotomy. The way that I have framed it is that I am more drawn to classical ideas of what it is to be a man than modern ones. It seems to me like many men probably would be. I strive for perfection and admire it, so I love classical music, good wine, great food, fashion, classic literature and aesthetics in almost any medium. I think it's relevant to say I'm heterosexual and identify completely as a male.

I think that maybe we're just prone to more classical tastes and that might come from tendency to be introspective. It's only the popular culture that tries to portray neutral (and often masculine dominated given the history) things like classical music as feminine. I think that there is a much more subdued and mature version of masculinity that should make a comeback. I pictured a mature male INFP as sort of gentlemanly kind of character, but that's my take on it.  




 I am wasting my potential. I'm just watching all of my opportunities pass me by and I'm not doing a thing about it. I am in a constant state of being frozen by my own fear and I've spent years trying to overcome it, but I just can't. I'm 22 and I'm stuck in the mindset of a 19 year old. I see so many people my age doing great things and taking charge of their lives, but I'm stuck in neutral with the pedal to the floor. Even though I'm in college and studying something I like, I'm not where I could be. I took 2 years to figure out that I hated what I was studying in college, one year being alone and depressed, and two since then trying to piece my early 20s back together. 

 I'm a musician, but I haven't written a whole song in more than a year and it's killing me I'm so trapped in my own anxiety about actually writing something. I'm classically trained on piano and have taught myself 2 other instruments, but I can't even write a fucking pop song anymore. I'm so stuck I can't even feel things anymore. I see kids just out of their teens writing great music and really starting to get some good shows and I feel like I've wasted so much time and that my time is running out. 

Every teacher or professor I've ever had has told me I'm one of the smartest students they've ever had and I've tested as highly intelligent on every intelligence test I've ever taken (if you take stock in those), but I can't seem to figure myself out. I can never find any traction in my life, I feel like I'm just floating along. Everything feels completely hollow. 

Instead of being creative, instead of building lifelong friendships, instead of getting in shape, or writing an album, or a book. I've spent the last 2 and 1/2 years depressed, drunk, and jerking myself off. I should be writing music, I should take account of myself more, I should just *feel* more, I shouldn't be as skinny as I am, I should be writing more articles as a journalist and getting my name out there, but I can't and I don't know whats wrong with me. I've seen therapists, but most of them have told me I'm almost too smart to treat. They tell me I know too much about their methods or too much about philosophy for them to treat me in the way they would normally treat someone and we never get much further than that. Great I have all this intelligence potential, but it doesn't do me any good. 

I'm so afraid I'll spend all this time figuring it out and by the time I do all my opportunities will be behind me. I don't know what to do and I'm terrified.

 Her friends aren't my main friend group, but they're people who I'm becoming friends with through other mutual friends and events pretty quickly. I just don't think she's going to let it go. 




 Eh I mean, I'm still feeling raw from the breakup. There was a lot of potential there and she was the one who couldn't discuss anything and then just gave up, so I'd be lying to say I wasn't angry with her. 




 I've tried to be friendly, but she just tries to avoid me when I'm around, so I've taken up the same policy. I'm also not actively trying to get involved with her friend group, it just so happens that we're often in the same places and get along pretty well.  




 I wouldn't be rude to them. I'm actually kind of confused about how they feel about the breakup. Most of them have just been very warm, and from talking to them it seems like they think I was a good thing for my ex.  




 We never really were friend before. It went pretty quickly from casually dating to having sex, and then soon after that a relationship, so there wasn't a pre-friendship. 




 Nah she split up with me. I thought we could have talked it out. I haven't been caring too much what she thinks since she dropped me pretty harshly. I just don't want to be overstepping my bounds, and her friend's and I are getting pretty chummy. 




 My ex-girlfriend split up with me a few weeks ago and since then I've been keeping myself as busy as possible. I was pretty hurt by the breakup, but I really realized that I didn't want to fall into a slump because of it. My ex had serious problems communicating, she couldn't differentiate between a serious conversation and an argument, so I feel like a lot of responsibility for the relationship ending falls on her. This has helped me move on faster than I have in the past. 

I go to a small university where almost everyone knows everyone, or are in each other's social circles. Since the breakup I've been going out a lot, going to every party I get an invite to, and going to plenty of shows. 

Hard part is, a lot of my ex's close friends, and their friends, go to my school, so we see each other all the time. My ex doesn't go to this school, so I go to a lot more of these social events than her. I was really awkward about seeing them in the first few weeks, but since then I've actually been hanging out them quite a bit when we end up at the same event. They're great people and I think we get a long really well, in some ways I think I get along better with my ex's friends than I ever did with her. The thing is sometimes she shows up at events and I don't know how to navigate that. Should I just back off when she's around or keep up being social and friendly? I really don't feel like talking with her much. She's a very judgmental person. 

It's a tight social community, but should I keep up social contact with my ex's friends, even though I don't think either of us want the other one around right now?

**tl;dr**: Ex broke up with me. I go to a small school with most of her friends, and me and her friends end up at a lot of the same events. My ex doesn't go to my school, but she's around since her friends go there. I like socializing with her friends, but I don't really want to be around her. What do you think can I do to manage this situation? 




 It's a dystopian future for a lot more people than just the Nazis. Not saying everything about how culture has changed is bad, but there are a lot of things about the globalist society that are dystopian.  




 Your dad sounds a lot like mine. He's an engineer who's great at his job, but emotional stuff just gets by him. As soon as I get on the phone with him, he'll talk about work for hours using technical details there's no way he could possibly expect me to understand. I think he's gotten better over the years, but with everything other than work in his life he's a bit absent-minded. I don't know if he's as awkward as your dad, but mine definitely has hi moments. I was having flashbacks during the whole time I was reading your post. 

All that being said, I know he loves my entire family, and he'll always do his best to be there for us.  




 I'm trying to avoid Canada Goose, just because it's what every other person wears here. I don't really want to stand out, but I've never really liked big labels on my clothing. 




 I'm looking for a parka that can keep out the cold. I've seen plenty of people recommending fishails, but I'm going to need something that can really keep the wet cold out. My upper limit for price is $500. Can you give me some suggestions? 




 This is completely anecdotal. I'm an arts major and top of most of my classes. I've never met a STEM student who wasn't struggling to keep their head above the water in arts courses. Both of my parents are successful mechanical engineers running large projects, and all my life they've told my brothers and I never to become engineers. From what I've learned from them and the people they work with, most people who go into engineering either go into it because they didn't have enough security to take something else, or they have poor social skills and are more happy looking at designs and blueprints than dealing with people.

 




 Actually really interesting you mentioned Boards of Canada with reflector. I've been getting a BOC vibe from the second half of Reflektor. Awful Sound has a that guitar part you mentioned, some of the textures in It's Never Over, the chimey synth sounds in the chorus of Porno, and the last 6 minutes or so of Supersymmetry. I'd say Arcade Fire have definitely listened to some BOC. 




 There are people from all over the world that share that list of qualities. I think what you just described is largely how humans behave when they don't think about what they're doing. Unfortunately it's easier for most people anywhere to not think. Making wide definitive statements that you only have personal experience to support is ignorant.  




 Yeah it's pretty much just exam time that I have a problem with, time management isn't too bad other then that. 




 I'm coming up to exams for university, and I have absolutely no time to get to the gym. two hours out of my day would throw off my schedule and make it difficult for me to complete the work I have to do for school. What can I do to help me manage exercise while I just don't have time for the next few weeks? 




 I don't have trouble speaking so much when I'm nervous about a certain thing but when I have a lot of background anxiety. The days where I feel like I'm on high alert all day for no reason I sound like I have a speech impediment. I stutter, mumble, and speak quieter than I normally do. I'll mix up my words or take a long time to find the word I was looking for.  




 Yea, I know what you're talking about. I definitely get that "click of a switch" feeling. 

It's not that there aren't people around who like you, it's that there aren't many people who think the same way as you. I don't think many people think about weighty subjects like; existence, religion and political ideologies that often.

I know that I think about those things a lot. So much so that it's almost as though I have a huge part of me that few people see. It's like there's a side of me that I hold back from most people, because they aren't interested in seeing it or are unable to engage it. Lately, I've been noticing how few people have serious opinions or have ideas that are important to them, and it makes me feel very detached. I can be in a crowd of people who like me, and have a great time with them talking about superficial things, but when I think about how much I internalize it makes me feel alone.  




 I don't have aspergers or adhd, but the symptoms caused by PTSD are very similar to those diagnoses. My parents weren't abusive, (though my mother could be emotionally I suppose) but they are serious professional types and were very emotionally neglectful. My family moved around a lot and I was left with a series of unstable babysitters, and was bullied severely by other kids. 

I started dissociating and dealing with that by just distracting myself with hobbies and pop culture. I had really deep knowledge in things like history and literature from a young age because I used those things to occupy myself from strong emotions and dissociation. These interests might have looked like "autistic interests", but they weren't, they were some mix of stress and being above average intelligence. I had anger problems and seriously over reacted to things through my preteen/early teen years, which definitly could have been mistaken for the "meltdowns" people with aspergers have. 

I had problems with concentration, but that was probably a mix of dissociation and stress. Blank stares and not being able to identify your own emotions are common symptoms for PTSD and Aspergers. 

All these things made it difficult for me to build relationships with other kids growing up. Not being in touch with my own emotions, dissociation, poor self-image, chronic escapism, anxiety and depression are all things I have to deal with because of my PTSD. 
 




 It really helps hide how much oatmeal there is in a smoothie. I usually put oatmeal and milk in the blender first, then I put a banana in and blend those three together, and once that's almost pureed I put in mix fruits and sometime some peanut butter. 

 




 Yeah I agree with this one, I just super blend 300g into 2 smoothies everyday. I've done 2 cups of oatmeal in one smoothie, I just had to let it soak in milk for a few minutes before blending. 




 Nuclear weapons. My brain just can't process that there actually exists weapons that can level cities and kill millions in the blink of an eye. We have the capability to ruin the whole planet if we wanted to, and I don't think we're capable of comprehending that.  




 I don't think men and women can be friends in the same way that they can with the same sex. I think sexuality really does get in the way of simply being friends with people of the opposite sex and similar sexual orientation. If people are single there's always the "why am I not having sex with _____?" or "Why would ______ have sex with ____ but not me?" More often then not someone develops feelings for the other person and then it's not really a "friendship" anymore and more  a relationship of unrequited feelings. I think having sex with friends really changes the relationship and usually messes it up.
