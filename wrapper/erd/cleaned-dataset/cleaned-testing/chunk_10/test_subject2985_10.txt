 Only played two (extremely laggy) games with him, but my initial impression is that he's a total fucking monster. His W is hard to land (might have just been the lag) and maintain, but it deals and heals massive damage, and his Q really wrecks. The E is a decent, though not amazing, escape and chasing tool.

As great as his Q and W are, it's Entomb that's his best ability. It probably needs to be on a smaller cooldown, because it's insanely good. The other Ult is kind of awkward, though it seems okay (especially with the level 20 buff), but it can't touch Entomb.

It's also fantastic never being truly dead. I normally hate death traits (I main Tyrael), but I have to credit the designers for this one. It's awesome not only having something to do while being dead, but also having no travel time once you're back up.

Leoric is super fun, a total powerhouse, and I really like him. 


































 What? How is what she's wearing asking to be graped? 




 /r/gogopgo 




 /r/gogopgo 





























 Yeah. At that point, "add water" is about your only recourse. 














 You may be right, but I think he's got real support, and thus a real chance.

We'll see. 
























 She's got a 25 year head start on him. He's put a big dent in that lead in the 2 months that he's been running, which is especially impressive given his resource advantage, and, as you say, [the media is pretty much blacklisting him](https://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3dxvft/cnn_made_my_jaw_drop_this_morning/). 




 By closing the loopholes that allow corporations to make billions in profit without paying any taxes on it. That's a big part of his platform. 




 That seems to be true, though the fact that he's hugely destroying every other presidential candidate (including Hillary) in rally turnout and individual donation has me wondering why. 




 How are your private police, fire, military, and roads working out for you? What are the premiums like? 




 That was hilarious. 




 He's kind of a big deal.  




 That's what they all say ;) 




 Data isn't free. He's simply choosing to conserve his resources in this area. it certainly doesn't mean he's not trying to win.  














 Many women opt for sports bras for that reason. 









 It might be a stargate. What if it's a stargate!? 




 To be honest I'm not sure. I've never ran naked before. 




 Most nude running events are actually clothing optional, and many women opt for sports bras (and most everyone opts for shoes). 






























































































 I agree. Gerrymandering and The Electoral College have to go. 






















































 Note this is not a hasher-affiliated event (to my knowledge). Just sharing it here because it seems to align well the hasher philosophy. Also, I believe some hasher groups take trips to Sunshower together. 









 Are you maybe thinking of Donald Trump? He paid people $50 a piece to attend his announcement speech.

Bernie doesn't have any significant personal wealth, he's running a very lean campaign, and he refuses to use a SuperPAC. He is definitely not buying crowds. In fact, his platform is centered around stopping people from buying elections.

Check out this interview, if you still think it's possible that he'd pay for crowd attendance:

 I wonder if we could get one of the networks to do a story about this.

Even NPR is largely ignoring him. He gets an off-handed comment every now and then, usually prompted by a caller's question *about* him, but that's about it, and they usually change the topic very quickly. 












































 Where did you hear that, and how on earth could Sanders afford to buy 10,000 people per event? 









 /r/gogopgo 
























 I think they announce them a few weeks in advance. Not sure why.

Ohio is a hugely important election state, so he will certainly come here eventually. 






















































 I do agree that that was kind of silly. The rest of the article is pretty good, though. 




 Not that late, either, though. I think it's less than 7 weeks after the Iowa primary. 




 Looks like March 22nd:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2016

It says "caucus", not sure if that's the same thing. Might want to find a second source to back this up. 




















































































 /r/gogopgo 







































 That's Bernie. 




 Personally, I think he'd dominate in the general. With as many republicans as I see on a daily basis crossing over the isle, and with the way that he's energizing the left (who don't always show up at the polls), I think he'd be pretty unbeatable.

Conversely, I think Hillary is pretty divisive. People either love her or hate her. That said, I think if Bernie can't beat her, nobody can.

So really, I think this election is really all about the democratic primary. In my opinion, whichever one of these two wins the nomination will win The White House. 




 Thank you for sharing it in the first place :) 









 Because it's a poll about two progressive candidates. This is /r/progressive.

I'll ask for a third time: how am I, at all, skewing the results for Sanders? 


































 You're already thinking about his second term. I like that optimism! ;) 




 I know they're already starting to run into quantum tunneling issues at 10nm. Will the 10nm processors the final generation of processors as we know them, meaning what follows will have to be something new? Or will hardware manufacturers push for even smaller processor components? 









 /r/gogopgo 



















 It wasn't when I posted it, but now I can't get to it either. Sorry :(. 








































































































  You are brigading votes for Sanders so that the results so favor him.

Again, how am I "brigading votes for Sanders?" How does asking the question "Would you vote for Clinton or Sanders" in any way favor Sanders? 



















  Then you can use the success in the poll to claim Sanders has actual support

How does this poll favor Sanders?

Furthermore, how can you imply Sanders doesn't have support? 


































 And that's from Fox. Imagine what the real number is! 
























 It's going to be super fun! I'm really pumped, and a surprising number of my friends agree and are coming with me. 




 Not sure, to be honest. I'm sure many of the women will opt for sports bras. 














 Will do. 




 I, and at least one of my friends, will be walking the 5k, if that helps. Most of the day after will just be relaxing at the resort, too, though there will be swimming and other activities (frisbee, volleyball maybe) as well. These things are typically pretty fun, but there's also a lot of laying around and relaxing, too.

No pressure, though. If you can make it great. If not they might do another next year.
