 It's all good. 




 I figured with his partial nudity, the NSFW tag was a safe bet. 









 If you'd like to check the website http://www.dominos.com I'm sure you'll find my spelling to be accurate.

 




 Domino's doesn't have an "e" in it. 




 Looks like a steak and a side of mashed potatoes. 









 Amen dude. I couldn't have said it better. 




 I clean the ovens every other Sunday at closing. Last time, I came in and there was a well proofed pan about to be thrown out. (We throw out unused pan pizzas at close of day). I grabbed the pan and poured a little bit of butter, cinnamon, and powdered sugar all over it. Put it in the oven 1.5 times. Poured sweet icing all over it after I cut it. Let it cool. Became the physical incarnation of diabetes. 




 I remember when me and my sister were young, we used to jump from one bed to another but we'd be either jumping in slow motion or "floated" across. My sister remembers it too. It's so strange. It felt so real. 




 That's the same guy on the gas pumps here in Mississippi. 




 I'd throw a party. No one would show up as usual. 




 "Our Purge"
Ted kills retired Bob Kelso.
Carla kills "young Carla".
J.D. violently tortures and kills the janitor.
Turk and Cox compete on who can carry more bodies to the morgue.
The Todd kills all the women (except for young Carla). 




 I have that kind of thing happen way too often. I didn't know it had a name. I've never had any luck on Google. Thanks for the link. 




 I'm stuck with a bunch of twenty something's (people my age) that frequent central perk and drink coffee all day. While I wonder where they get the money to afford to sit around all day since I rarely see them at work. 




 A tier one MTG deck(mainly because I don't feel like building another one), a bottle of The Glenlivet 21 year old archive and a pound of weed butter. 




 Really late but I believe in this instance we should get to see the date that Dr Cox and Carla went in that is mentioned in "My Quarantine". Asking with other little things that were "remembered" by the senior staff. 




 My little brother used to play in blender boxes 




 Same here. I don't get it. 




 When Jesse is walking up to his newly purchased house and his dad tries to stop him and Jesse reveals the keys. Epic! 




 Stay at the Tower on earth. Hang out in the hangar with Dead Orbit. 




 Fuck Walmart too 




 I don't do that but my phone didn't come with headphones. LG G3 BTW.

 If there's ever a movie or TV series about Gustavo Fring, some of this should be the trailer. Not all of it. Just some parts. 




 The store near me has cart returns but the people hired to get the carts are responsible for stray ones throughout the lot. It varies from store to store. Not saying it's right to leave them about.  




 Lol. Love the reference. 




 Do you also offer a chocolate covered pretzel? 




 I do this anytime I have to get up before noon. 




 I had that problem and now I use flushable wipes. 




 Awesome. I love that song 




 Like in the Merle Haggard tune? 




 Yeah thanks 




 Cool 




 Thanks 




 Late as hell but I truly hated him when he fucked things up with Gus. That was a great opportunity for everyone involved. Why fuck it up? 




 Nothing. I'm the supplier of the $100,000,000,000 




 For some reason, I knew that. Like, in the back of my head. 




 I discovered this song on my classic country station on Pandora. I can't figure out why, but I really enjoy this song. I only have one question (I'm not a trucker and don't know any so I don't understand the lingo) what's he mean by "bear"? Is he talking about actual bears or is this code for something? 




 No. But thanks anyway. 




 Thanks so much! I appreciate it.
I'll try it after work 




 Here's your pizza. I hope you tip. 




 I recently bought the LG G3 and the default texting app doesn't appear to let me set individual notification sounds for each contact.

I did some research and found Textra. I like Textra but when I tried to send or receive a picture message (MMS), the app is telling me it can't detect MMS settings. I'm guessing it means APN info.

I did further research and tried a few APN URLs with no luck. It's stuck, not failing or succeeding.

Does anyone here know the APN for the MMS  protocol? 




 I used to play this one. It was super fun 




 I completely forgot about those games. 




 Dude. That game. That sound track. The memories. 




 It's a tie.
Zelda a link to the past and super Mario All Stars (yes, all four). 









 In two words "twenty fourteen". 




 Not gonna work... Refer to the image. 




 Lol
