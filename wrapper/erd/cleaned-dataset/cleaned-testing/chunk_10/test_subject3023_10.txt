 He's waiting for NOVAA 




 The following is a transcription of an audio tape found in an abandoned prison, around a dozen bodies.

March 2nd, 1965. 5:00 pm. My senior year of High School.


Getting plenty of sleep, I presume? he asked me. The cool spring air drifted in from the window, diminishing the intense heat that plagued the office. Sweat dripped off of the doctors long nose as his mouth fidgeted, appearing to chew on something that wasnt there. His eyes flew from his paper, to me, to Anna, and back to the paper. His irises were dark enough that you couldnt tell for the life of you where the pupil ended and where the mock color began.

Yeah, plenty I responded. Anna made eye contact with me, as she knew that was a lie. By that point in my life, sleep wasnt high on my list of priorities. I worked the night shift to collect enough money to get by, and my ability to stay alert during those hours was fueled purely by caffeine and horror stories. I wished that I could get more, but if I still wanted to be able to go to college next year, rest wasnt an option.

Are you two, uh, sexually active in any way? Dr. Lanius questioned, glancing down at his clipboard, then quickly at Anna, then back at me.

No, not yet, I replied. Anna and I had only known each other since Sophomore year, and right from the start I would have given my life to protect her. I asked her out a month after we met, and wed been dating since.

Ah, I, uh, why dont you tell me a little, uh, more about your relationship? His breathy voice was getting on my nerves. My parents urged me to come to the doctors office at least every six months, something that I was ordinarily fine with. However, the latest addition to the roster of physicians, Dr. Lanius, had begun to irritate me.

I dont think thats anything you need to know, I said sternly, standing up and reaching for my jacket. Every visit Id had with him, Lanius had proceeded to ask more and more personal questions, and by now, I was fed up.

Ah, yes, yes, yes, youre probably right, you can go now he muttered after staring at me. Turning his gaze to Anna, he said See you both back soon.

As I walked out of the room with Anna, I looked back to see Lanius staring at us, his fingers tapping madly against the clipboard. I yanked the door shut behind us, stampeding my way out of the office.

Would you like to schedule a later appointment? called the receptionist as I sped past.

No, thank you, I replied, pushing my way past the doors and into the open. The snow around us was just beginning to melt away, giving the air a cool and crisp smell. The trees had yet to grow their leaves, but the grass was already green and blooming with life. In a couple more months, summer would be upon us. I felt Anna pulling at my hand, and turned to look at her. She had long blonde hair and green eyes, and a smile that could have stopped a missile if she had wanted, or stopped the stars if she was willing.

William, he was just asking what he needed to ask, she pleaded with me.

Yeah, I know, I replied, but it just seems like he wants to know so much about us. After a while I stop being comfortable with that.

Im sure itll be fine, Anna grinned, Now, you promised me wed go to see The Sound of Music today. Unable to resist her smile, I led her to my car.

June 2nd, 1965. 4:00 pm.


The sun pounded down on us as we walked away from school. There was only about a week left until school got out, and just two days until the Friday Dance. Cars out of the parking lot of the school behind us, blasting tunes from the Beach Boys. Anna would sing along for the word or two she remembered before returning to discussing her plans for Friday. All I could think about, however, was the hours I would be awake for tonight.

My blue eyes had dark bags under them from the lack of sleep, and my dirty blond hair was getting greasy. It wasnt an attractive look, but in a few months, I would be at college and it would all be better. At least, I hoped it would. I was running low on horror stories, and Im fairly certain that I was addicted to caffeine.

The sweltering heat surrounded us as we turned the corner, walking past a black van as Anna went on about the dress she was going to wear and I wished I were in bed. There were only four blocks of identical suburban houses left before we got to my house, but I would always walk Anna four more to her house, to make sure she would get home safely.

I looked around, taking in our surroundings. The trees stood still due to the lack of a breeze, and the sky emanated life, without a cloud in it. A red Buick whizzed down the street, and a black van took its time behind us. At least if I had to toil through the nights, I could live for the days.

Hey, said Anna, Lets play I Spy, okay? You go first.

Alright, I laughed, I spy with my little eye a tall, green object.

A tree, she giggled, cmon, thats not even hard. Let me show you how its done. I spy with my little eye something square.

I stopped and looked around for a square object, my eyes passing over a black van that was slowing down next to us. I glanced over at the nearest house before my eyes snapped back to the van. Grabbing Annas hand, I slowly started walking down the street. The van sped up behind us. I started walking faster, scanning for a road we could take that wouldnt let the van through. Unable to find any means of escape, I started running, pulling Anna behind me. Suddenly, she dropped to the ground, pulling me down with her. I attempted to sit up, but found myself unable to. My eyes closed, and fell asleep. I was equal parts terrified and relieved that I was getting some rest.

June 2nd, 1965. 6:00pm.


I rolled over, refusing to get up. The alarm hadnt gone off yet, meaning I at least had a few minutes more to rest. I didnt want to open my eyes and break the spell. Suddenly, I heard Annas voice.

William, William, please, get up, she whispered, I dont know where we are but your Doctor is here andIthinkyouwererightabouthimohWilliam. She spoke so quickly that her words blended together. I sat up quickly, almost immediately awake. We were in a dark and cold room, with almost no moisture in the air at all. I was laying in a bare-bones prisoners cot, and Anna was pressed against me, terrified. We both wore nothing but blue patients outfits. Across the room, Dr. Lanius sat with his legs spread apart and his hands on his knees. He was wearing a set of green scrubs, and his mouth and nose were hidden behind a surgeons mask.

Old sawbones has a few tricks up up his sleeve, it appears, he muttered, in a voice just loud enough for it to echo around the room and into the hallway, Now, do follow me. Or you could stay here and wait the Nurse to prep you, but that might be a long wait.

He giggled to himself, amused, and then stood up slowly, and started walking down the hallway. He stopped, looking back at us, and motioned for us to come along. We both sat as still as statues for a moment, and then I got off of the cot, and took Annas hand. We followed Laniuss slow saunter down seemingly endless twists and turns before arriving at a metal balcony overlooking a room full of what appeared to be corpses. Anna put a hand to her mouth as we walked in, and I squeezed her hand. I would get her out of this.

You see, Ive been conducting these experiments on the effects of sensory deprivation on the mind, said Lanius, facing the bodies, but unfortunately, adults arent very good at conveying their emotions. After many attempts to make them say what they felt, I realised they were no good. So, Ive turned to what I believe to be the perfect solution. Why not use angsty teenagers? Theyre all about emotions, arent they?

As he said the last phrase, he turned to the two of us, looking as if he expected a response. When he didnt get one, he turned back to the dead, and was about to begin speaking when one of the dead interrupted him:

HELP! cried the man, completely motionless, except for his mouth, I - I CAN SEE HER, I CAN SEE HER, AND SHE WANTS TO CATCH ME, HELP!

Anna cried out and turned to run, but Lanius held out his hand and stopped her. I held her close to me, and when I did, I could feel myself trembling.

Hes not dead, began Dr. Lanius again, hes merely experiencing extreme sensory deprivation. I tried placing them in sensory deprivation tanks, but that didnt produce the data I needed. So, I went to the extreme. First, I gathered some volunteers who were willing to help, and then I performed the surgery.

The basis of the surgery is the severing of nerves. I leave the needed nerves untouched, such as the ones that keep the heart beating or the lungs breathing. But the nerves that allow people to move, or feel, or see, or smell, or hear, or any of that - those are gone. They cant feel or see anything from outside. They are quite literally trapped inside their minds.

At this point a woman interrupted him, weeping, and asking for someone to kill her. Dr. Lanius remained silent, and another man stated how he didnt know if he was alive or dead, and several more proclaimed that something was chasing them, or that they could see loved ones.

Ive left it so they can still speak. They dont have any haptic feedback from it, though. They can talk, but they wont feel themselves talking nor hear themselves. Ive got them all set up with Tape Recorders, so I can listen to what they say, Lanius elaborated, I tell them going in that I want to hear about what they feel, but every one of them quickly descends into asking for death or saying theyre seeing someone. I feed them, clean them, keep them free of waste, all so one of them can tell me how they feel. But I never get it, do I?

Dr. Laniuss entire demeanor had changed from when I would go to the doctors office. He was cold and calculated, and didnt stutter or second-guess a word he said. But one thing remained the same - he kept stealing glances at me and Anna.

Lanius proceeded to spend the next several hours informing us of the procedure, as we sat mortified, unable to speak a word. He went on and on about how he severed the nerves and how he kept the people he operated on alive afterwards. It was several hours later when he glanced at his watch and told us that it was time for rest. He led us back to the place where we woke up, and closed the door behind him without locking it.

Hes killing them, I said to no one in particular.

Hes doing worse than killing them, said Anna in a hushed voice, hes torturing them for the rest of their lives.

We both sat in silence for what seemed like hours. Eventually, Anna laid down on the cot, but I knew she wouldnt be asleep for a while. I felt like we both knew what was going to happen to us, but I had the solace that at least we would be doing it together.

I then started to think about the people. The tortured people, kept in that room, kept in their heads for what could be a certifiable eternity. Unable to move or feel for the rest of their lives, unable to know if anything is real or not. Being buried alive seemed like nothing compared to what awaited us.

I guess I knew, in that moment, that no matter what was going to happen, I was going to end up laying there on that table, as still as the grave, talking maybe to no one, maybe to everyone. If I was going to spend the rest of my life that way, I was going to spend the time I had left saving people from that fate.

Quietly, I got up and moved towards the door. I gently pushed it open, and cringed as it creaked open, its metal hinges grinding on more metal. I followed the twists and turns of what must have been a prison, with our room being a cell, and the room of the barely alive dead being a mess hall. As I arrived there, I crept down the metal staircase and towards the bodies. 

Amidst their shouts and whispers wishing for death, I found the woman who was crying earlier, asking us to kill her. I pulled the tube out of her mouth, and watched as she slowly choked on a lack of air, unable to feel herself doing it, trying to ask me to kill her the whole time. Her sightless eyes open and closed as she retched, attempting to say kill me, incapable of knowing I was doing just that. After a moment, her shaking stopped, and she was gone, freed from her torture.

I moved on to the next body, yanking the tube of air out of his mouth. I didnt wait for him to pass before moving on to the next, going on a spree of euthanasia to free the undead from their torture. I pulled the plug on the last one, and turned to see the clock on the wall strike twelve. Standing underneath it was Dr. Lanius, watching me destroy his work.

June 3rd, 1965. 12:03am.


You son of a bitch! yelled Lanius as he tossed me into a cell, opposite of the one where I could see Anna, sitting up from the cot and staring at the scene.

That was my lifes work! We could have, as the human race, have achieved immortality! The ability to truly be free! I just had to know what to do to the bodies to make the people happy! And you ruined it!

Dr. Lanius pulled out a keychain, and proceeded to almost lock the cell door before reconsidering. He grabbed Anna by the arm and me by the scruff of the neck, and dragged us with him. His strength surprised me for the squirrelly old man he had always seemed to be.

He pulled us into a room that was devoid of anything but a skylight, through which moonlight radiated in. Stars filled the night sky, and I attempted to take a snapshot of that sight, in case I was unable to ever see again. Lanius saw me staring and grabbed my head, now forcing me to look out of the window.

Do you think anyone out there is coming to save you? he hissed, Do you think anyone out there even cares about you? No, theyre too preoccupied with their brand new Vietnam war and their race against the Soviets to control the sky! Youre worthless, and you worthlessly destroyed years of work and research, and made it all worthless, you worthless son of a bitch!

You destroyed their lives, I responded, trying to stay calm, They didnt want to live out the rest of their days like that.

Oooh, you want volunteers, do you? Lanius asked. He grabbed Anna and threw her on the floor. How about this. Lets make a deal. Either she gets to go free, or you get to go free. How about that, huh? You volunteer as my new test subject, or you volunteer her as my new test subject! How about that, huh?

Anna looked absolutely terrified, just about as terrified as I felt. Lanius had gone completely crazy, and was yelling, when before all he would do was talk just loud enough for you to hear.

Soooo, Mr. Worthless. Who is it going to be?

I looked up at the stars, and then back down at Anna. I thought of the moon, and then of her smile. The smile that could stop a missile. The smile that could stop the stars.

Take me, I said.

You ever wonder if the hero of a story questions whether the decisions he made were the right ones? I do. I cant tell whats real anymore, and whats my imagination. This could have happened in hours, or in days.

I dont know anything, really. All I know is I need to talk, and hope my story is heard.

I dont know if he actually let Anna go.

I dont know if it was worth giving my life for hers.

I dont know anything. Im just lost in my mind.

I sometimes wonder how long it will be before I forget things. I cant hold on to every memory forever. But I feel I have to. Im trapped in a prison of memories, far worse than that cold cell. Once I lose my memories, what do you think I will be?

I sometimes wonder if theres someone here. If I was rescued, and if Im in a hospital right now, about to be cured.

I sometimes wonder if I was rescued and there is no cure.

I sometimes wonder if I will ever be rescued. 




 Happy Cake Day, and yes, support has ended for it. I'm thinking at this point I might as well go and update it, because of that very reason. 




 Yeah 









 Oops, my bad. Failed to scroll down that far on the side xD 




 \o/ 









 You tried Refined Relocation? 




 Nope, we've done all we can. It's on Pahimar's side. All of our issues have been on the github for a while, just waiting on him. 




 Nickel and Platinum do not spawn. I know there's a recipe that needs platinum with OpenModularTurrets (oversight on my part), but is there anything that you actually need it for? 




 Swamp Thing is the first PBN song 




 The transition music between Haywyre and Porter was Halsey - Ghost (Lost Kings Remix) 




 Vanilla+ is designed for scenarios like this 




 Probably not. There's not anything stopping you from adding it yourself, though. Just keep in mind that we probably won't support issues you have unless you can reproduce it w/o added mods.

(also you may want to delete the ae2 config file if you do add it) 




 I sort of rewrote the pack halfway through. Original modlist:

http://i.imgur.com/Yry0BZP.png

It was more based around Thermal Expansion and AE2 - but considering most of the complaints from the original Horizons involved having those two mods, I decided to re-do it to involve Mekanism and etc. The goal was to avoid any gameplay mods in Infinity, unless they had a sufficient number of addons. AE came close to making it back in, but it's been in almost every FTB pack since it was released. 




 If it doesn't get added to Infinity, I'm going to add it to Horizons. 




 Which version are you running?

Also, it's probably related to this issue: http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-0-0-galacticraft-oil-acting-like-items-we-can-pick-up.95531/ 




 Mekanism, Engineer's Toolbox, Aura Cascade, and EssentialCraft III all have Ore Doubling mechanisms. 




 Not to mention adding a variety of RFTools, such as a [block protector](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Block-Protector), [a crafter](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Crafter), [screens](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Screen), [a spawner](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Spawner), [a power relay](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Power-Relay), [modular storage](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Modular-Storage), and so much more. Direwolf actually has spotlights on all the things from the mod, and I recommend watching them. It's so much more than just the dimension builder.

 What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? 




 Extra Utilities and Mekanism both offer methods of RF transport, along with a somewhat complicated way using Aura Cascade. 




 You can actually charge stuff straight from the Mekanism Energy Cubes 




 Clockwork Phase probably has the best early game tools, and as for the most complex tech trees, you'd probably go for Mekanism. Aura Cascade and EssentialCraft III are both really in-depth magic mods that you should also definitely check out if you've got the time.

As for automated mining, you've got Mekanism, Extra Utilities, Essentialcraft III, and even Blood Magic to help you out there :) 




 Yup. It'll take a while though, due to some backend stuff. Not much we can do to speed it up. 




 Generally the goal was to not have any mods that were in Infinity in this pack. Obvious exceptions being things like NEI or Chisel. Blood Magic made it in purely on account of it's addons. 




 They obviously loved my beautiful un-customized Twitter background. 




 Oops! Well, it certainly is new to FTB, to say the least.

 What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? 




 Oh my goodness, I would love to get my hands on a mod that does this. Obviously not for legitimate use, but I love the style it gives the cities.
