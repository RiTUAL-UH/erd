 idk, its kinda handy knowin where hurricanes are and where they are heading.. and that gps thing is so niffy they put it in everyones pockets.


LMAO dude.
 




 I'm low on grain, made too many mines, not enough farms... i got wood though, but then again you knew this.

 The key, of course, is to never accidentally an entire pot. 




 If you want to enter but are struggling for something to say, just share what juice you are currently vaping

homemade is the best way. Though i do have way way way too many flavor bottles. and most the labels are worn off.

still i like to be able to make low nic for day time, and high nic at night.. and have some super high for more stressful times. making it at home makes this easy, otherwise i would have to buy 3 to keep up wiht my styles. 














 That doesnt make sense for the paragraph.

Are the people with other jobs not volunteering as well?

or is it just sex workeers
 




 So why pay for hetero sex when you can get the homo kind for free? is that the ticket?.... but but if homo sex is legal, wont there be homo sex workers?

They really arent competing in the same market.. besides for the fence sitters. I mean if the homosexual prostitutes had a 50% off sale... i would still pay ~~ore~~ more for the hetero, cause that's what i am into... now if the homo sex was 75% off then... hmmm maybe.
 




 most have some sort of marking.. bumps are better for sure.. but in the next couple years, it wont mattr, due to reversable usbs coming out
 




 But that doesnt mean it cant be fixed. They are driven to this by the nature of things. 

 




 They and others were pushed into it. For a couple reasons.

Annoying ads.

click bait.


A stripper once told me, being respectful is all and go, but sometimes you got to swallow your pride to put food on the table.(she was talking about how she hates stripping)

ok annoying ads helped kill wire, cause so many wire users are now on ad block. No I am not saying wired had these ads.. the net did. But the point is the wire earns less money per visitor than it could had the net not had annoying ass ads driving people to adblock or ublock as people prefer today. I really wish the 'free market' would do something about the annoying ads cause they are effecting all sites, including reddit. aka dont do business with companies that use them or ad companies that make them.

Your trying to survive, you aint making shit cause of ad block.. and then you see this other site getting hits after hits with its stupid stories "can having a dog keep you from getting cancer?"... "there are 12 things in your home that could be killing you right now, click here to find out" and its all on 14 pages of click throughs...and you find this site with its trash stories is raking in the money and while you spend money trying to get good stories...arent... so you turn to click bait.


really and I know a lot wont like this, but since the free market isnt bothering to fix a problem that effects everyone, then maybe some ads need to be regulated. I dont like this idea at all either. It would be a tough law.. and most likely our congress would rather block adblock than the problem. But if every single site had static ads.. that dont make noise.. i wouldnt use ublock. And the wired of the world could make maximum potential per visitor 









 Correct me if i am wrong, but it sounds a bit different when you say chronically alternating light cycles, versus poor sleep.

I also have heard that certain spectrums can effect our serotonin/melatonin cycle, so this test makes me wonder if a it might be the lights and not the lack of full sleep. And wonder if changing spectrums for people who have to have weird hours could help. 









 Nope.

Guy split from the klan, made his own klan called the rocky mountain knights. The rockey mountain knights are the ones that opened up. John Abar also didnt found the KKK, he founded the rmk.

[That article was just crap reporting](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/11/03/inclusive-kkk-montana-chapter/18406129/)

 gooooood luck with that.. how long has it been going on? nearly 2000 years now.. most of their persecution history is about as real as the war on christmas.
 




 This community is horrid to ask a question or post anything in. (unless it is an complain about  perk lowering payments post)


My theory is age range for the sub, that this sub skews younger than most reddit and that includes some of the sillier subreddits.

edi: point proven.. thanks. Yall really do make this subreddit unhelpful and hard for people to ever approach. Downvote away, yall are still childish assholes that make this subreddit suck for most people.

 




 Its a bit overly snarky and douchy.(and dont get me wrong, anti vaxxors are dangerously stupid, and harm more than their own) I mean if you want to win people over...It reads like a bunch of reddit comments jammed together.

it also burns some strawmen and lumps various groups together.
Not all anti vaxxers are into alternative medicine. 

Not all anti vaxxers think 'mom is right', some think that one stupid doctor with his one retracted study was right.

the article also pretends anti vaxxers are all liberal, and while there are some noted ones, [its actually more a conservative thing.](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_National_ConspiracyTheories_040213.pdf) which 22% of conservatives and 12% of liberals.. the point isnt politics, but if your writting this for some goal in mind either to educate the skeptic or make fun of the anti vaxxer, well you got to get this right.


3 is comfirmation bias.. which infects a fuck ton of people.. even einstein.


I'm not going to go through this all. I agree anti vaxxers suck but this article wasnt that much better.
 




 thats trashist 




 The scariest part was when he got up... ["just one look, i dare you"](http://i.imgur.com/WL2LdMe.jpg) 




 "we are a christian nation.....now lets put a bunch of graven images of people on our bills"

er.. 




 there are strifes between the people but yeah. Jewish people are respected on the quran and israel already has had sunni allies from egypt and jordan. They also have been increasingly allied with the sunni world since 2009. SA supported israel in their attacks on Hamas.


so.. its not as cut and dry as you might think.

the middle east is also only a small part of the islamic world. The majority of asian muslims are sunni's and they have no problem with israel.
 




 i dont disagree but why was this replied to me? 




 one of these days we might prove some of the crazier shit you hear from some advocates. (I was in NORML, sorry but there are some that go a bit overboard on unproven claims...well some formerly unproven)  




 I do think its both the pnacrs and the pro settlement people who are the most against the deal.

lets pretend, in happy BS land, that all the middle east went peaceful.. and they all heaped praise on israel...think israel would start to support removing any settlements? Honestly support a completely peaceful and disarmed palestinian state? no they wouldnt. you dont build permenant structures on land you might give back.
 




 Here they are [gandy dancing a rail road.. at lake murray SC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TzSSzLGl8M feature=youtu.be t=41)

notice how little they move that thing.. think about the miles and miles, they had to do. 




 The best is to design the place where people only feel comfortable at a slower speed. Though that can piss people off quite a bit.

still there is tangential evidence that while changing speed signs have no effect, they do when they dont end in 0 or 5 as people actually notice them.
 




 We do need to call these people out and make fun of them. its ridiculous. And not just this idiot, same with the people who think the minion dollars are telling them to fuck off.. which they REALLY SHOULD.

no seriously this is 2015, not 1812. We know how this works, and went through this shit in the 60s. The human mind is pattern orientated. Thats why we see smillie faces in the clouds and hearts on pluto. Its also why people heard satanic messages when you played records backwards...

its also very internal, i bet none of you saw 666 until you read it and then looked at the feet. It just wasnt in your mind, like it was in this lady's and now thats probably all you can see.

like the minions. i couldnt tell what they were saying until someone told me what they were saying and then thats all i could hear.

did they make the minions tell me to fuck off? NOPE, same with this cake, costco isnt playing a joke, or hiding satanic messages.  Its our minds trying to make patterns out of chaos.

Someone should tell this woman that she is a human being and then send her on her way. Perhaps though, we shouldnt tell her that the 666 is coming directly from her mind and not from the cake.

(but seriously, we shouldnt make these news stories that sounds like a he said/she said and either could be correct.. no we need to make fun of them and point out that science says people do this and they are just hearing/seeing things.. it wasnt real in the 60s and it isnt real in 2015) 




 I was thinking of [getting this one for the car 15000mah](http://www.newfrog.com/p/15000mah-multi-function-car-jump-starter-mobile-power-bank-charger-95322.html?utm_source=BBS utm_medium=reddit utm_campaign=products) but i worry a bit, as All the similar ones are twice as much. (the youtubes show the same style, working well to jump cars)

 




 fair enough but his question was seeking answers for his own setup.

being literal is fine but he was seeking help and not necessarily taking a survey. But hey, maybe he has a spreadsheet with your name in column A and "takes spare batteries" in column B.

:P

Instead of giving him what he asked, I gave him what he needed. 

 




 That might be too cool. Have to teach our kids not to disarm themselves for cool prosthetics.

and to change the tone, I do wonder how it will change, this kids life. Old style prosthetics could be off putting for children, where these would invite children to talk to him.  




 Not a scientist but I'll make an educated guess.

its based on the probabilities on how often pluto should get hit, versus the lack of impact craters.  I forget how old they said, 200k years i think, so in 200k years there should have been at least 1 impact site(even likely more but at least 1) and since you see none, it has to be less than that old.
 




 Not sure why people saying carry more batts, since you got the xpro.. that would be a second mod.

You can get a [portable power charger](http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Portable-Power-Bank-000/dp/B00LRK8JDC).. there are some that can jump your car as well. These are only for recharging though.. and not passthrough vaping..but it does work if no convenient places to charge, but do have time to charge.

 nope.. he was correct. He has the right to sue.. and if he loses, he will pay court costs. You just disagree with the unsaid meaning behind his comment, which is totally different.

I'm also not as sure as you that he will win. We do it all the time. And as of today the 18th, AFTER the kkk rally, we still havent had a judge issue an injunction. 

 




 not without limits.. PLAIN AND SIMPLE.. even SC has limits.

The question is whether the law that forbids cities from enacting laws in conflict with the state, can do so for temporary and emergency reasons. I dont think he will win.

The state cant tell me how much i can sell a gallon of water for. if someone wants to buy it for $200.. so be it.. but if we get hit by a hurricane, suddenly the state can. The law gives leeway during emergencies and one could argue the upcoming protest was an emergency situation.

I dont have a dog in this race but, I'm definitely not going to be absolutely sure how this will be ruled. WE have a fuck ton of limits to guns even in SC.

 




 they arent really passing an ordinance but an emergency temporary measure.. I'm not so sure he will win. It would be different if it was permanent. There is a lot of leeway when its an emergency and temporary measure. 




 one of the safest places on the planet to live.....

and american supermax prison. Everyones monitored. Movement highly controlled. Mail is read. You wont get robbed or stabbed in a supermax. And its the scummiest, most dangerous neighbors you can have.(yeah I am sure someone can find an incident at a super max, but for the most part, we have closed all the holes that you see in normal prisons and they are the safest place to live.. especially considering the danger of your neighbors)

But i dont want to live in a supermax. Almost no one does.

So just saying "you will be less safe..without.." is meaningless, without the other half "you will give up..." (privacy, freedom, w/e)

If you want super safe, lock everyone in individual steal bubbles, ship food in through a tube...no one wants that.. so blow it your your ass about "thousands of lives"

(and shhhhh this is the big BS key about all this.... notice when gobberments get hacked, what do they do next? CHANGE METHODS. Obama isnt staying at that hotel for fear of wiretaps.. we are moving our background checks to paper to make it harder to steal everyones.. guess what.. the private market.. er terrorists woudl do the same damn thing.. your not going to catch the next 911 being planned on a registered cell phone, they just assume the NSA is listening.. this is also why the TSA doesnt work.. .as soon as osama found out we monitored sat phones... he stopped using sat phones. WOW.) 




 Nexen is apologizing for a pipeline break that leaked five million litres of bitumen

this is bitumen.. it makes oil look like dish soap. This is what they wanted to send through keystone. Its nearly impossible to clean up.

it used to be called garbage crude back before we sucked up all the sweet stuff. It really is horrible stuff.

the pipelines are more likely to break because the bitumen has to be heated to high temps just so it can flow.


 




 apparently he forgot to tell himself.

Amazing all these "not a scientist but global warming isnt true" folks, get so bent out of shape and yell "your not a scientist" to people who also arent scientist but say global warming IS true.

Mind you these are some of his comments

.Some of the hysteric and extreme claims about global warming are also a symptom of pagan emptiness, of Western fear when confronted by the immense and basically uncontrollable forces of nature. Belief in a benign God who is master of the universe has a steadying psychological effect, although it is no guarantee of Utopia, no guarantee that the continuing climate and geographic changes will be benign. In the past pagans sacrificed animals and even humans in vain attempts to placate capricious and cruel gods. Today they demand a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.

ok AGW is a pagan thing.... but he says the church needs to be separate from the science and let  the science do its thing.. but he claims it is a religion thing. How can the pope NOT comment, when this cardinal says its all pagans?

and he also said.

Radical environmentalists are more than up to the task of moralising their own agenda and imposing it on people through fear. They don't need church leaders to help them with this, although it is a very effective way of further muting Christian witness. Church leaders in particular should be allergic to nonsense..... I am certainly sceptical about extravagant claims of impending man-made climatic catastrophes. Uncertainties on climate change abound ... my task as a Christian leader is to engage with reality, to contribute to debate on important issues, to open people's minds, and to point out when the emperor is wearing few or no clothes.

hes a church leader... saying AGW is bullshit but demanding other church leaders, not get involved and def never say AGW is real. how does that even work either?

This cardinal is so stereotypically right wing, its almost racist. ;) (yeah the right isnt a race) but its akin to right winger christians in america wanting all these exception laws, whose heads would explode if muslims wanted the same.  This right winger wants to let the church deny AGW, but gets pissed off when the pope supports it?

and how the fuck can he publicly challege the pope as a catholic? this is another difference with progressives. A lot of progressives didnt like the last pope. But they didnt come out and do this crap.


 









 I have never seen a church, besides scientology, that charges a fee in the US. maybe I am wrong.. been to baptist, catholic, episcopal and presbyterian.. now they do more than encourage tithing, but have never seen one with a fee.  




 i'm guessing...perhaps..he is speaking of some of the more ornate and touristy churches. [some of these places](https://www.google.com/search?q=famous+churches+germany es_sm=122 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIhJPD7NDlxgIVw9SACh34RAJv biw=1280 bih=637) might be visited by non-catholics. Though i still fail to see the need for government in this case. The church can collect tithe from its members and charge a fee for tourists.
 




 my geek club plays for upkeep of its place.

the geeks who use the club donate or pay a dues.

CRAZY I KNOW.. no gobberment needed and it works just fine. And when it doesnt, its because there is no need for your club cause no one is coming.


last, I know its kinda fucked up, but HAVE YOU SEEN CHURCHES? They have a tendency to be the most ornate and expensive buildings in town.. here in the US.. and they dont seem to require a tax collector to make that so. You can read this entire paragraph as saying .. THEY DONT NEED IT.. THEY ARE RICH AS FUCK.
 




 nice explanation but that was part of the sarcasm of this post.

see the right got the point along ago. Dont yall remember the stories of all the muslims refusing to do their jobs in the run up to full islamophobia?

There was the cabbies in new york who wouldnt drive drunks and single women and blind people with a dog?

the right were all over "OMG IF YOUR STUPID RELIGION SAYS YOU CANT DO A JOB.. THEN GET A DIFFERENT JOB"

and i agreed.


there were more.. the fake story about the bus driver pulling over to pray, making all his passengers wait for a bus with a non muslim driver to drive them the rest of the way. It wasnt true but the right got it then.. same thing "if he cant do his job.."

and suddenly now it is christians, they are woefully ignorant and illogical again.

And we will kill this, its just too easy to do. its a last gasp of desperation to keep their bigotry.  But its already happening, mainly by satanist.. i'm guessing muslims dont want to cause a ruckus but it would help if they did with respect to these laws.

its really time we kill christian exceptionalism. I dont mind what you believe. Really dont give a fuck. As long as you dont affect me. What I do mind is the exceptions we give to the christian nuts. Mainly abortion. 'no tax dollars can be spent on this one single solitary legal thing'.. because it would offend the religious. They need that exception carved out in all laws. They attacked the breast cancer charity for giving to planned parenthood despite every dime is used for breast cancer screenings and materials. But ABORTION.

my tax dollars sure as fuck cna be used for torture, spying on everything i do, and blowing up people half a world a way, who didnt do shit to me but now dont like me very much anymore... I cant get an exception no matter HOW strongly i feel about it. I could have fainting attacks over it all. Doesnt matter. no exceptions for me...

and why just abortion? why dont they demand not a single penny of their tax dollars be used to pay someone to work on sunday? hmmmm

 appendix, tonsils, wisdom teeth... I have been all through the bible, looked through the quran.. is their a preacher that knows?

see these are things i am going to have to know.. the whole religious books havent been updated in a while, and when my car breaks down, i'm going to need to know who to blame, and how to pray it working again. Cause this whole paying for mechanics and buying parts sucks.

 the only time i saw this was when it snowed 3 feet in dc. My dog did the same. 




 and a lot of christians know the truth but refuse to admit or believe it.


No fan of fundies..but if you dont follow your book to a T, then you worship yourself. And well there arent shit for people that do. Some of the amish, some of the nuttier muslims, a few christian cults in america.. but even then, a lot of them simply pick and choose.

and like i said before, building a swing set for the kids, you going to follow every instruction. You are going to use every screw. You arent going to pick and choose, or your kids wont have shit to swing on. But I believe in the swing set, so i follow every word of the instructions.

no i contend that not only is religion complete bullshit, but that a lot  of them actually know this deep in their hearts. Oh they might still believe in a god, but they know the religion is BS. thats why they only adhere to the parts they like. 




 I think you can be safe in thinking its real.

These dont cost crap.. seriously, you can get them shipped.. for under [$3 from dx.com](http://www.dx.com/p/assembling-google-virtual-reality-cardboard-w-resin-lens-set-khaki-339632). Thats profit, plus shipping and handling and costs..

this is a porn site that wants more people to have vr.


its really not all that much more expensive than sending you a catalog. Its practically trash and i suspect one day will be seen as such, even if it is cool trash. You will get these things built into cereal and pizza boxes in the next year or two.
 




 and they have been driving net tech since the net started.

yeah there are a bunch of vr demos and crap. but there is a ton of vr porn. They are working on some vr live cams as well. They just making sure the public has the materials needed to help the porn site profit from opening up a vr section.

 




 I suspect this is an example of internet art.

not saying that out of 7 billion of us, you cant find people this stupid, but out of 7 billion of us there are actually more snarks.

Anyways, to change the mood, you do know Jeb made a law, similar to this story, where if a woman wanted to put her child up for adoption, and didnt know the father, she had to take out an ad like this. Which may sound good to some, but the point of the law was to shame single mothers. Jeb said their wasnt enough shame for them.

 




 you can do anything as long as people comply and dont complain.

you actually have to defend your own rights. 

Just like a cop can ask to search your car... its up to you to say no. He doesnt have the right to search, or he wouldnt ask. or like my beach guard comment, in this thread. People actually listen to him.. ignorantly and turn around and avoid 'their beach', there is NO LAW, preventing the beach guard from lying. Its actually up to the people to know that they have a right to access the beach despite this asshole is paid to tell them they dont.
 




 its that way in the states as well.. though some people like to pretend it isnt true. grew up in a resort and certain beeches they will have a beach guard come tell you, its a private resort.. and you can just ignore him because while you cant leave the beach onto the private resort the beach itself isnt part of it. A lot of the rich, there,  get super annoyed when they realize the beach outside their homes isnt private.
 




 and doesnt some of that soil just look damp.. like if you stuck your toes in it... 




 its always raises all the way into the ground.

though it should be noted that while the cable tv side is in decline, the net side is exploding and highly profitable.. insanely profitable.. unconsciously profitable.
 




 and they are mostly staying alive on ignorance and sports.

My landlord, the only reason she kept cable was for PBS.. thats it. 200 cable channels and she watches public broadcasting. I set her up to watch it without cable and she canceled. But there are a ton of people just like her.... they keep cable out of ignorance. 




 well thats one way to get comcast to cut you off. 




 One thing people should note.

The emissions that helped set this record, came from the 70s. Your parents and grandparents emissions helped set this record and yours today will be felt 40 years from now.

 And GUESS WHAT REPUBLICANS... that means... THAT MEANS.. less property tax increases. OMG.

why did i direct at republicans? every state that legalized or medicalized, did so by progressives who were fighting republicans, the entire way.. small gov republicans tend to be big gov republicans when it comes to marijuana. Republicans are trying to force DC to under the voters wishes, by fucking with their budget. It is a republican group that is setting up rico lawsuits against marijuana companies and the businesses that do business with them in colorado and it is republicans in neighboring states suing colorado to try to force the fed to undo their laws. Yeah sure republicans passed a law saying the feds cant attack states that go medical.. ... that expires when Obama leaves office, despite Obama wasnt attacking states that did medical. Its horseshit

 




 Pro-tip.. run the PC a bit strenuously(not that strenuously, just warm it up).  Run prime95 Get that CPU warm.. 

It will make the cooler sooooooooooooo much easier to remove.

 I figure its one of those scientifically designed games, designed around human psychology. The click and wait make you feel scheduled to play. they all tend to have the same BS. Clicks that can be reclicked in minutes , ones in a couple hours, and one in several hours. Some factory that can spit out cheap quick items, or spend all night making the good ones. The short ones when you playing and getting all your shit down, the medium for when at work, so you can check up at lunch hour and the long for when you sleep.

I've gotten sucked in before but its interesting to watch it happen to others.. we just have such a desire for efficiency. And after you 'learn' the game, you get locked into your routines, all your clicks are mostly the same each session. and yet they can feed an addiction. and a lot of these games are down to a science on how to play the weak for money. 




 that is ... if you trust the robot driver, who gave you that data.  

i mean basically its the google car saying 'this is what happened'

;P

Yeah i know.
 




 the infamous wink wink nudge nudge exception. In SC for a while we had the video poker and you were actually not supposed to give people "winnings".. but you could give them refunds, so you asked them how much they put in.. and thats all you could legally give them.  Of course you took their word for it. They didnt like this wink wink and banned the machines completely.

and in my childhood home town, there was an infamous wink wink nudge nudge exception. We had blue laws which meant you couldnt buy shit on sunday.. literally.. manure couldnt be bought, only necessities(it was fucked some foods ok some not. yogurt ok but icecream not). But our town was a tourist beach town, and it annoyed the tourists they couldnt get towels and buckets for the kids on sundays. So we got a new law saying tourist items were ok on sunday. The next day the sticker sales went through the roof. By affixing a sticker with the town name to any item, it suddenly became a tourist item. So you could suddenly buy shit on sunday, as long as it had the sticker. And that wink wink nudge nudge destroyed our blue laws.

and last in my town, when they approved alcohol on sundays but only for restaurants, every single bar in town had some kind of food you could buy. One just had peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, which was enough to qualify for a sunday license. The wink wink nudge nudge is a powerful tool.
 




 yeah you used to be able to get a commemorative bottle for the price of a tour.

and they still have bars and people still bring alcohol, the bars sell mixers and your not allowed to bring your own mixer. So cokes are banned, but liquor is fine. its all odd. 




 yeah its a dry county.. its kinda odd, as the distillery is  the biggest businesses there 




 Interesting case. Brings up a lot of mixed feelings and hypotheticals.

What if a baby is on the tracks, and you see a slowish train coming.. have all the time in the world to move the baby 3 feet out of the trains way.. but choose to film instead. A lot of people would want to charge him with something. It would be hard for him to use the 'reporter' defence.

same baby a few days later falls in an alligator pit, and no way to get to him easily or safely and he films.. its a bit more complicated now.

so should we have samaritan laws? and how should they be written? well should they cover doing all that safely and humanly possible?
 









 You can choose not to give your data to private companies.

you do know what subreddit you are in?

Thats actually quite fucking hard these days. If you can actually manage to protect your own data and only give the info you want to people like google and MS and the government who buys it from them.... then you will be protected from the NSA as well

sorry you have a naive view about the privacy problem. Businesses can find out who your neighbors were 20 years ago.. tell me right now, what you signed or agreed to, for them to have that info? You dont even know what info of yours is on the private market and yet you sit here and claim you have a choice. Thats laughable man.

how many cam girls do you think know they are auto recorded by bots for the private market to resell their data? Yeha they should ASSUME someone is doing that right? But THEY HAVE NO FUCKING CHOICE dude. Its CAM and be recorded and resold.. or dont fucking cam.

The private market is just as sly. you dont always have a choice on your data.

Yeah she is in public this is a public example very easy for people to understand, it gets more convoluted.


tell me right now.. no google

which phone company can i use that wont sell to the government?

which grocery stores wont sell my data to the government?

what search engines?

which cookie trackers are ok? you know sites dont tell you.. you have to look.

sorry it takes two to tango and you dont always have a clear choice.. i bet you cant tell me the cookies you collected today and what sites they were from and how that data is being used.. without being a techie. yeha i can get all kinds of cookie blockers and i can encrypt my phone calls. but its not like there are choices.

 




 so you are saying that we all know every bit of data the private market collects on us? and how they use databases to build profiles?

I'm not sure I agree.

and once again, the biggest customer of that private market data is the government. it takes two to tango.

 




 we as in "the west".

Yes you didnt do it, i didnt do it.. but the WEST DID.. and if you live in one of those nations, its perfectly acceptable to say 'we' because well.. the east didnt do this. The west did.

Sorry if the term 'we' doesnt have to be limited to your family, your neighborhood, your town, your state, your country, or your hemisphere. I could have been more concise that I meant the west, but if you are part of the west,  its acceptable to say "WE"


just like you can say "they" when talking about the middle east.. unless you are in the middle east.. and then it goes back to a 'we'


'they' in the middle east, were arbitrarily fucked with, by 'we' the west, the people 'they' in the middle east keep attacking, all because 'they' in the middle east, sit on a fuck ton of oil. 

my spelling can be off but the use of we is totally legit here.
 




 the west, mainly england, israel and america.

but it was basically just western capitalist interests.

Its just a general term, like how people treat the middle east as one cohesive unit.. or asia as another.
 




 well one day.. just not in 15 years. it wont even be noticeable. WE might get 3 years of no monthly record highs.. thats about it.

The maunder min occurred at the same time as an ice age, which started long before the sun went quiet and ended long after the sun went active again. Sunspots do have an effect on the enviroment but not that great. The little ice age was caused by more than a lack of sunspots, which is proven since the ice age started before the sun spots went away.. and didnt even really get worse when the min happened.

but the deniers have been going off on that for years despite the debunking.. much like they do with the hockey stick, despite it has been verified dozens of times by totally independent science groups, using totally different proxy data and often totally different proxies. When multiple independent groups, using different methods and different data all coming to the same conclusions, thats what we call a well supported fact.


YOU DID READ THE ARTICLE RIGHT? where the scientists said the papers totally lied about her report?
 




 dishonest deniers, combined with a media that loves sensationalism.

the deniers started the ball rolling, the rest of the media jumped on it because it was some juicy denial.

and yeah there was probably some legitimate illiteracy since i read at least one article where they called the maunder minimum an ice age 




 lying? her report said nothing about ice age.. the conservative media went spewing lies about how she said an ice age was coming in 15 years and it spread all over.

are you just being obtuse? thats what this article is about.

it wasnt that this is OTHER scientists disputing what another said. THIS IS THE AUTHOR OF THE REPORT.. saying the media lied.

Its yelling the theatre isnt on fire when it is. Not sure what point you dont grasp about that fact.

 california is going to be an lesson to all of us about what the US faces as the coming reality of having to ration things like resources, like water.  Lake mead could be dried up by 2021, not only leaving california and Las vegas fucked for water, but also fucked for power.

People like Tom Selleck will start to see real jail time and not just weak fines for stealing the water that belongs to everyone.
 




 no

yeah doesnt work this time 









 and the conservative media wont get in any trouble over this. it  was all an accident.. once again. 




 well its a bit more complicated than to call that "Saddam's aggression".  First kuwait was loosely part of iraq during teh ottoman empire, when we overthrew the ottomans, we went around drawing country borders and cut kuwait from iraq. We did this to better protect british interests from a strong iraq in the persian gulf.  Iraq has always felt kuwait was stolen from them. Kuwait and iraq got into economic conflict. And saddam accused them of slant drilling for oil into the iraqi territory.

saddam actually approached the US rep, and ASKED.. what would our response be to him invading kuwait. And our rep said it was an arab matter..(as in the people not the country), suggesting we wouldnt do anything. And so he invaded.

[gulf war wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War)

[April Glaspie wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Glaspie)

our rep

and dont forget saddam felt like he was our ally. We had just helped his country in the iran/iraq war(while secretly helping the iranians) and even changed the law so we could sell him the precursors to chemical weapons he used against the iranians.. the left overs of which we later recovered in the second gulf war rotting in the desert.


so its a bit more complex than to say "saddams aggression"

we built the middle east bed, out of the ashes of the ottomans.. its not the best way to make countries.
 




 maybe it is march 14th, in 2005 and he does have a dentist appointment, just for some reason all of us woke up today thinking it is dec 9th, 2018. 




 and a huge difference, those same poor whites, are arrested less than poor blacks for the same crimes.

those same poor whites when arrested, get convicted less for the same crime.

those same poor whites get lower sentences than blacks for the same crime.

those same poor whites get 200% more call backs for the exact same resume as poor blacks. exact same resume.

those same poor whites are less likely to get shot by the cops when they run.

but what ever you do.. dont look at societal influence on the stat.

because the bigots only want you to look at one single solitary difference between the groups.. the one thing that cant be changed.. race.. and ignore all the other differences that could actually influence the stat.. like poverty you mentioned, but there is MORE.. a poor white person is treated different by society than a poor black person. its a fact. And that has influence on the stats.

we arent that different there are less differences between a black dude and a white dude than two chocolate labs with different mothers. There is no special predisposition for violence or anything else in race.. race is mostly just a societal concept. you cant draw lines and say this is black and this isnt, in science.. race just doesnt really exist.

 




 op is a racist

black on black crime isnt any worse than white on white. You tend to do crimes against people near you.. it happens we are still well segregated.

but yeah the point is to put the stat out there, show one 'difference', in this case color.. the point is to mislead and to suggest, blacks due to being black are murderous. And then they go from 'til" to propaganda. You cant do science that way. Its like showing how most herion addicts drank milk before ever becoming addicted to heroin, therefore milk must be a gateway drug. yeah some people who drink milk dont end up on heroin, but nearly all heroin users drank milk at one time in theri lives. Its the same with this horseshit. 'sure some black people never commit a single crime, but since most convicted for crimes are black therefore being black caused it"


 




 everyone knows why this shit is being constantly posted all over reddit.

we get it black people murder more whites than white people murder blacks.. but that info out of context doesnt tell you shit. The problem is when these armchair ~~bigots~~..er scientists try to interpret the data.

and why is it always black versus white? same data show men do most the murdering.. maybe we should all hate on men.. maybe men are predispositioned to murder.. so anti man hate isnt sexist.. its supported by the data.

but you dont see this shit posted constantly.. because anti man hate isnt their goal, so they cherry pick race. 

and if you dont get context.. blacks have less opportunity than whites, blacks get arrested more than whites for the same crime, leaving them less opportunities for jobs and blacks are treated as criminals even when not for most of their lives.. you can see in experimentation where even black children think being black makes them bad and evil, you get taught this all your life.. that your damned no matter what you do.. that might effect the murder rate.

also its been reposted to hell on til
 




 you mean the cyber war? yeah its been going on for decades.

its similar to economic wars and spying for our corps.. these wars dont get fought in the open.

and china been doing this for decades.. they used to just drop infected USB sticks in our government parking lots. Whats a rank and file employee going to do with a found usb stick? yep.. plug it in and see whats on it.

anyways, we in the US get to hear about it when its everyone else. You dont get to hear about us doing the same things over there. A little now and then with snowden and the virus we helped attack the iranians with.. but mostly you dont hear it. Well we are the worlds biggest spies. Then its china and then israel.

the biggest problem with this, is the info they got...this was a nuke going off. They got some juicy bits. of course we wont hear about it, if the NSA got the same info on chinese politicians.

 




 no so sure about that 0.. the NSA not just collecting data on US.
 




  There are actually some way better answers but this one works on the "the gov is your bestest friend" crowd.

and same could be said about the private market which also had some spectacular data breaches that often they lie about for a long time before finally admitting it.

There are better answers of course but this one works on the 'private market is perfect and your bestest friend ever crowd and is totally different than the government'

sorry dude, had to.

the government isnt the only people we have to protect our privacy from. Matter of fact the biggest customer of the private markets selling of our data.. is the GOBBERMENT.

so lets just agree it takes two to tango, and their is shit on both side of the private market, public market fence.
 




 they make small ac units that attach to the fan intact.

People who spent 2k for an invisible tent arent going to be hot.
 




 click the picts.

in pict 2, you can better see the floor which looks rather solid.. it looks like fold up slabs of pvc.

you can also see the tube that you use to blow it up.. you keep the fan on, constantly to keep it blown up and air coming in.

 




 first pict is an ocean.. and yeah they arent a fan of salt water or wind. The rest of the picts aren't at an ocean. 




 estonia wifi'd pretty much the entire country.. over a decade ago.

GO USA.. GO USA... catch up to the likes of estonia.. now google where the fuck that country is, cause I know you dont know.


its a former soviet state..(think on that a bit).. yeah its tiny and all that.. but it rose from the fall of the soviet union, which we bleed to death with the cold war.. and it didnt have the benefits of moscow..but they wifi'd their entire country. (PS people still buy net)


 




 She will be happy to know we are only doing this to protect the children... /s 




 dont have chickens.. love this sub, would like chickens, dnt like eggs much but would like chickens anyways.... i know a ton of you hug and kiss chickens.. and i'm fairly sure most of you dont get sick, though, I figured i'd share the science findings. 














 and in contrast.. i have seen dogs react to time very well. my friends dog gets excited when his kids are about to return home from school. long before he could possibly hear the bus. And ex girls dog, used to know walky times a bit well as she was a bit regular. Yeah you could say he had biology pressing on his bones.. but if she was distracted at the 'time' he would show up with his leash. now it might not be based on 'time' but other clues.. 'when i hear this tv show, it means kids almost home, and they give me treats'. but i have seen clockwork pets.


and as for "gone for an hour versus 10".. maybe they know the time, but are still just as excited to see you... an hours a long time when you cant play on the net. 




 at an estimated 2.4 trillion when all is said and done, it is a little more than 4 times the entire budget of nasa since its inception. The moon landings, hubble and fix, the space stations(there was skylab), the mars probes and rovers, the lost craft and space shuttles, this trip to pluto, all of it. 




 i tried, but [screwed up along the way](http://i.imgur.com/8eCxmsw.gifv) 




 its also hard to say what is a religious war.. did the muslims hit the towers due to religion or the bases? was the iraq war a religious war? our president got war reports covered in biblical imagery and south evangelicals saying god choose bush to start the end times in the middle east.. and many of the enemy called it a war against islam. History wont call it a religious war. There was a coalition of causes and agendas, but its hard to deny that religion played a part in the war on both sides 




 it flows up, which is why some of the best stimulus is food stamps and UE.

And your pay is actually just a cut, that you get from the total value of your man labor hours, that the owners a lot you for providing the means of production. You flip burgers for $5 an hr, hes selling your hours for more to the public or he is going out of business. $5 an hour is your cut from your production, due to him owning the franchise. So the higher ups already get a cut of peoples earnings, thats one  of the ways to get rich, is have others earn it for you.

and of course the lower you go down, the more of that paycheck that gets spent and the bottom brackets spend more than 100% as they need food stamps. That money flows up, because the biggest chunk goes to the owner of the mcdonalds, while only a small portion goes to the burger flipper, and yes, the owner of the franchise, pays up, to the mcdonalds corp which extracts some value from his earnings and so on.

money flows up, thats kinda the point to capitalism(without progressive taxes and/or  basic income)... thats why its all in a pile at the top.. and kinda missing at the bottom. It disappears at the bottom and reappears at the top. 




 It is English.

There is no is in [Minnesota nice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_nice). It is a type of nice.

 




 the intelligent enough to be really dangerous. The really good conspiracy theorists, have some brains, just not a lot of sense. And you mix in a shit load of truth, with the nutty stuff, makes it easier to go down.

you dont just come out and say the UN is a space cult, no you talk about the estrogen levels in our water(true), the new concerns to protect our kids in sports(true) and the everyone is a winner generation(a little true).. and then tie all that into making our kids gay, and there is enough shit you can look up, thats "oh shit he was right about the estrogen"...  that space shit might be true .. Idk not a good conspiracy theorist .. but you put enough true stuff for people to look up, suddenly the wacky stuff seems more real.

and not all his conspiracies were that wacky sounding. so, yeah its kinda easy to see that. Thats what makes them the most dangerous. the good ones arent the crazy lady screaming about rainbows in her fountain. 

he is entertaining i will give him that. 




 odds can be odd at times.


non intuitive. I remember the 'smartest woman in the world" got a lot  of attacks when she correctly gave the odds to the [monty hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem). Many a learned face had egg on them that day. 




 Yeha love the non intuitive maths and sciences, it messes with the brain. But be careful with verbiage.  Your dehydrating by more than 1%.. there is a reason why the wiki said dehydrating until it was 98% water. your dehydrating the water down by 50%.. thats the key to the riddle, the way its worded.


and here is another .. that used to bug me.. its a physics one.

you got a plane with perfect mathematical wheels on a runway, thats also a treadmill. The treadmill is hooked up to detectors so it will go in the reverse direction of the plane at the same speed as the plane... will the plane take off.



Still, its a good TIL, so i upvote even with the small caveat on the title.



 




 its dangerous to dismiss this as just pandering. and most likely it will cost taxpayers a lot of money.

ok you make a law saying 'clergy cant be forced to participate.. in a gay wedding'

when they are already protected from marrying gays.... but they arent from 'participation' depending on job or service. I hear ya.. his job is priest.. no it isnt, thats his title... it doesnt have to be his job. And anyone can become one. You could be a baker... or the justice of the peace, or a judge....

See no one can tell a church, that they have to host a gay marrage or that any priest has to marry gay people.... however, once those same people enter the public market place, WE CAN order them to not discriminate. they dont have to put a message on the cake, but if they sell cakes to the public, they got to sell you a cake. Though not sure if you want a cake made by someone that hates you.

this Bill would appear to say, if you sell cakes and send $5 off to get  ordained with the universal life church as a priest and suddenly you can be a bigot in the public market place. And say 'the act of selling a cake is participation'

you got to watch it.. sometimes things that seem like useless pandering can actually have real meaning behind them. thats not to say it would stand up in court, but this asshole isnt going to be the one paying the court bills. 




 It was insane, the telegraph was the first i believe to go all ice age.. that was expected. The rest of the media running with the clickbait wasnt. you'd think the people who saw the telegraph article might have read it and saw all the conjecture came from the reporter and not the scientist.

and what gets me is the media have swallowed this BS pill put out by the deniers that there was a global little ice age and it was 100% caused by the lack of sun spots, despite starting years before the sun went quiet. and ended years before the sun went active again.


and for some reason missed north america.. but what ever.

They sit there and scream that all the correlations in the climate record, all the proxy records are all bullshit..but a single solitary event in history correlating to a single solitary event in the sun, all of which MEASURED WITH PROXY DATA.. there was no direct measurement back then and fuck.. measuring sun spots.. in the 1600s. and this shit is the word of god, and all because of sunspots?

You really cant prove anything with an event of 1.


i bet you dude proud of his downvotes thinks the little ice age is the word of god and caused by sun spots.. wont be able to tell you a single scientist involved that even coined the term maunder minimum but he sure as shit will tell you it in fact caused the little ice age.


it was more than a media failing.. you have a known liar lying about a subject they always lie about, making radical claims about that subject that sounds like the exact opposite of what everyone else is claiming..... well you might want to take a second look.


i'd take a second look at shit dailykos claims about republicans.. i demand a source. because despite being left myself i know the publication is biased and i want the truth. Well you should second guess every word about climate change from the telegraph, because they are going to lie every time.

 




 sigh.. this horse shit again.

one you can prove agw yourself with some dry ice you cna get at any supermarket and two tupperwares and two thermometers.

Climate change versus global warming. Both were used with equal frequency until the early 2000s when suddenly climate change was used about 3/4s of the time.. what had happened?

LUNTZ.. [Frank Luntz and his global warming memo](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2003/mar/04/usnews.climatechange)

it was LUNTZ(R) and his focus groups who decided out of the two terms. AGW versus  Climate change, that climate change was less scary sounding.

you know the same assholes who like to call torture, 'enhanced interrogation' and the enemy was 'illegal combatants' so we didnt have to follow the law.

It was your denialists who choose to make climate change the perfered term.

and over night all republicans obeyed, they dropped the term global warming from their lexicon

and thats why climate change won out over AGW... despite in papers its still about 50/50


The phrase "global warming" should be abandoned in favour of "climate change", Mr Luntz says, and the party should describe its policies as "conservationist" instead of "environmentalist", because "most people" think environmentalists are "extremists" who indulge in "some pretty bizarre behaviour... that turns off many voters".

 I wear my negative comment karma like a badge of honor in this land of disinformation and shilling for the establishment that Reddit has become. I fight for truth and look only for real karma.

its just a crown to idiocy. Its a shame you cant see that. There is nothing wrong with being ignorant, but there is something wrong with holding onto that ignorance with a death grip in the face of facts.


 




 political loaded garbage. Yeah we want to figure shit out, it lowers health care cost. We also spent a ton on why black people get high blood pressure than whites. This is loaded garbage. same study showed non gay men are fatter than gay men. Why wasnt this titled based on that part or at least showed the difference? gay women tend to have higher obesity rates while hetero men do... but this is titled just looking at the woman part and ignoring it studied both heteros and gay people.. they are trying to find the obesity connections.
its because this is political horseshit.

hint if it is dailykos, or freebeacon, it belongs in /r/politics not the news. 




 E^2= (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2

is the more complete equation, that p after the plus is momentum.

when mass is zero e=pc

when momentum is zero

e=mc^2 




 I have a problem with the title, and yeah know it isnt OP. you can argue they are stupid, that their complaints arent based in science and you can even argue that no-gmo food makers support this and that it will hurt GMO food makers bottom line, but i still dont think you can call it an anti-gmo labeling law. then you start to get into politics over reporting. Its a disclosure law. right or wrong doesnt matter.. we can have a regulation that every thing made by a dude named fred be labeled as such. it probably offers as much meaning as GMO labeling from a science standpoint. but you cant call it an anti fred law. 

now i think the anti-gmo people are like anti vaxxers but i do like information. Not a big fan of labeling stupid shit like gmo, but i think people should be able to find out 100% of the information about their food, who harvests it, how it gets to them, how its grown, what countries, gmo, or not, kosher or not. tap water or real mountain springs. People should be allowed to refuse to buy shit for completely nonsensical reasons.(which to me kosher is a bit...) and there really isnt much cost involved in having that info on a website versus labels.
 




 i smell lawsuit. 




 [far too much](https://youtu.be/G3gNos3CX8Q?t=67)
 




 yeah amazon over hyped a bit.. but everyone ran with it.

Anyone remember black friday or black monday from last year?

Both were HUGE disappointments. 

[black friday has been getting worse for years](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-01/u-s-index-futures-decline-as-oil-falls-china-pmi-misses)

one of the problems is technology, the point of the deals was to get you in the store. Well people hate the busy shopping experience and they can double check sales and items on their phone.. the value of getting people into your store went down and so did the sales.

cybermonday was a bit more fucked from the start.. there is even less value to getting people into your stores.. online. you cant hope they buy the ridiculously overpriced batteries while they are there when they can just type in another address and get them where they are on sale.(they are going to have to change to min orders.. sale price valid with $45 worth of purchase and such)

why did anyone expect this off season sale to be different? yeha amazon said "bigger than black friday" and they can go suck a bag of dicks, but why listen to them? the  car lot down the road is always having the most amazing sale of the century.

this really was about as good as i expected. I didnt expect amazing sales. There isnt a lot of value in them anymore, especially for us virtual shoppers. And as such, the sales are going to be weak.
 




 what about that thing that almost looks like a fault line cutting through the mountains. I figure not a fault but it seems to continue for a long while and really resembles ones on earth 




 mailmen, some of the most loved government employees.
 




 he was so right about iraq as well.

and its all horseshit, we get to watch everything.

no one says this is a free reign to fund terrorism or anything else.

nothing in this says we cant attack them later for doing such things.


anyways hes proven himself to be a bigot warmonger and his own mossad disagrees with him on the deal. They dont think its the best, but they damn well think its better than doing nothing but continuing sanctions.
 




 South Carolina - Set by municipality (ranges from 12am to 2am)

Not true.. ranges 12am til ....

I tended a bar that didnt even open until midnight.. we sometimes closed after noon.

most bars in town here are open until things slow down, i stumbled out of many into the daylight..except saturdays, when things tend to close at 2am across the board.

the rest of the week.. they stay open til when ever.. it was actually a culture shock going to other states and seeing their bars close so early when night life here and start rather late.

 well that doesnt make sense.

1. if places for worship are for god alone, then why do people go there? do they want the mosque empty? maybe they are saying 'for worship only.. no bingo".. that might piss off some christians.

2. why would christians get more mad at the billboard than they do already at the other abrahamic sect? allah is just arabic for the word god.. its not even a name like yahweh, its literally the word god.  And its the god of abraham, so the billboard says "places of worship are for the god of abraham alone"(which by the way, is the same god as the christians, they all believe in the adam and eve crap)

 Sometimes i feel like an alien on my own planet, watching a society so culturally different, that the human mind doesn't even have the capacity to ever understand it.

"you are sending a camera 4 billion miles away to take a picture of a rock/icecube and some of you still think magnets are magic?"

People seem to think science missed a lot of low hanging fruit.  yeah a lot of herbal medicines do work and when they do, we find out why and make it potent as fuck and turn it into a pill.

and how the fuck are homeopaths in business, as a customer, get a fucking jug of distilled water, pour half your bs in a jar, fill the rest with distilled, give to a friend, now both you got twice as much and twice as strong BS for free. You can do that shit for life. its stupidity beyond comprehension.

*breathe cow, breathe...* 




 yall are ranked the worst of all. Well D.C. actually but yall are the worst state.

with 1/5 of your bridges scary as fuck.. and over 1/3 of your roads barely count as roads. lol, sorry but glad i dont drive there.


[source](http://www.businessinsider.com/worst-state-road-systems-2010-7)


and really with car repairs what your doing is paying a pothole tax to the repair dudes which costs us all more than just taxing us and fixing the damn roads.
 




 its ok, we plan to tax the poor to fix our roads, with a little help from the revenue fairy.

(honestly, our governor's plan cuts everyone taxes but the bottom brackets, whose taxes will go up.. and this is a revenue plan to fix our roads.. its an income tax cut which the bottom brackets get refunds and such wont help, coupled with a gas tax hike, which they say over all the average tax payer will save $66.. if you get a cut, which the bottom brackets wont, but if they drive, they will see a hike.)
 




 the titles bug the fuck out of me, because a lot of people never make it past it, even us esteemed redditors. And one of the biggest problems with misinformation, is our human tendency to lock in the first thing we learn. Some of us worse than others of course but they have shown even people who are more open to being wrong, often resist prove they are completely opposite from being right.(i know technically that phrase means 'wrong' but there are levels to wrongness) 




 its more clickable.

it wasnt a "poor interpretation".. that suggests a mistake. There was no mistake. Its called propaganda that the rest of the media ran with because it was so god damn click baity. The telegraph damn well knew what it was doing when it distorted the scientists claims.

 




 Actually not really.

First sunspot activity does show a small but real effect on climate but its WAY WAY SMALL.. we are talking about adjustments to the el nino/la nina cycle..stuff people have to measure to tell you this winter is colder than last. Its way minor.

the mini ice age which looks localized to europe(north america was only slightly cooler at the time).. started when the sun was active.. the Maunder minimum occurred IN MIDDLE OF THE MINI ICE AGE.

it didnt cause the mini ice age to get significantly worse at all. temps were mostly the same before the min as after.

And yeah the scientists in this project never said we are heading to an ice age, never even said this will help slow AGW.. all they said is they are predicting sun spot activity will drop to levels not seen since the mauder minimum.

THE TELEGRAPH.. a right winger denialist mag, decided to interpret that as "ice age" and many  other mags followed suit even conflating the term Maunder minimum with ice age. See the denialist rags, love to pretend the mini ice age was 

1. 100% global and real and perfect climate science but all the rest is bullshit

2. 100% caused by a lack of sun spots and please dont look when the cooling began. and dont look at a single other cooling element.


so when they heard sun spot drop to maunder min levels.. all they heard was ice age and ran with it.

WHAT PISSED ME THE FUCK OFF.. is all the media just went with the telegraphs interpretation of what the scientists said.

well A thats a fuck ton more clickable.. to say we are heading towards an ice age than 'the sun will have less spots than usual'

But yeah.. we had a busy sun.. and a strong el nino, that helped push 1998 record.. but heres the rub.. we have one of the quietest suns we have seen already.. we are coming out of a protracted minimum.. not as bad as maunder but the worse since direct records.. right now. And wel el nino is still a bit absent but slowly we seem to be heading that way..

BUT WE STILL SET THE RECORD LAST YEAR.

the effect sunspots have on climate, while REAL.. it is a plus/minus in the big ass equation, is minor as fuck.. and there were other mins besides maunder.. and we really didnt see much of a change in temps.. the little ice age, started before the sunspots got low.. it doesnt look to be even global and definitely had other causes besides sunspots.
 




 we started cooling 2000 years ago.. which is inline with our tile cycles.. it was overcome by AGW.

we already are pumping co2 to slow down an iceage. 




 we would all die.. even if it was 40% cooler 




 the 60% doesnt make any sense.

the model suggests we will hit [Maunder Minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_Minimum) like sunspot levels.. and thats way more than 60% drop

Sprer noted that during one 30-year period within the Maunder Minimum observations showed fewer than 50 sunspots, as opposed to a more typical 40,00050,000 spots in modern times

but the solar irradiance [hasnt fluctuated more than 0.2% in the past 2000 years.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_variation)




 




 greatest debate reply in the history of reddit.

absolutely nothing about this deal changes any opportunity to blow the every living shit out of them. The big difference is we can actually go see their shit what they are doing.. which is fucking excellent since bush inc outed the cia agent working on the iranian wmd program destroying lines of intelligence into the place.


Stop being a child, if you got something to say, speak the fuck up.

its easy as shit to say nothing but to attack the only person offering any thoughts or comments in this. Which is why i suspect you choose your stupid child like attacking comment rather than offer any kind of meaningful debate. 

I mean you do see the irony, in your content less comment calling mind "dumbest".. nah i suspect that idea went right over your little head.

 




 the us didnt have diplomatic relations with iran for decades that's similar enough to not recognizing. WE help fund the mek, supported saddam in the iran/iraq war and some the iranians through isreal, something like a million died in that war. Helped overthrow their democracy with the shah. Shot down one of their airliners...and many here call for us to "nuke the place to the stone age" and then israel and the settlements.........

just saying is all. Not defending irans actions but theres a lot of "oops my bad" to go around.  And we might need to step back a bit before throwing nazi references arround.
 




 even if it fails, it was the right thing to do.

and of course failure doesnt mean they get a nuke, failure, means they continue on the path to get one and the world chooses other options. 




 How often is this dude going to the dmv? Years ago it was once every 1-3 years for me, depending if they changed license plate styles or i changed cars. Now I go even less, due to you can do pretty much all of it online. And years ago for me.. it was kinda sucky, but since then they got a desk person that answers your questions as you walk in and you take a number and a seat. Its a lot better then the old days when you had to fight the leopards before they would see you. really today you could just replace them with a licence plate vending machine and photo booth/driving sim
 




 we already help feed the north koreans.. and rather inefficiently.. i think the world would be more than willing to help reunification.. and yeah it wont be anything like east and west germany, not just in costs, those people are fucked up. they've been brainwashed since birth. And live in a fallout looking society, complete with campy 50s looking propaganda posters.
 




 no they didnt.

some scientists say our sunspot count will fall to a level not seen since the Maunder minimum, which coincided with a mini iceage.  Thats not the same

Not a single scientists even suggested we will enter a mini ice age or that it will even help with global warming.

which predicts solar output will fall by 60 percent during the 2030s to conditions last seen during the Maunder minimum ("mini ice age") that began in 1645.

also horseshit.. sunspot number will drop by 60%(actually more if the paper is correct.. not really sure where they get the 60).. not solar output, thats just insanity. During the mini ice age, solar irradiance was only down by 0.2%

and the [maunder minimum occurred long  after the mini iceage started.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_Minimum) (read the lack of  sunspots didnt cause the shit)

people need to quit quoting conservatives who are interpreting science papers.
 




 My aunts preacher came by after she had gotten divorced and remarked that the size of her place showed she never paid enough tithe.
 

and i dont have a problem with them leaning on members a bit, like any club, but this and what my aunt went through is a bit ridiculous. And well for most churches that i have seen, if they spent a little less on the building, they would have had a lot more money, for good deeds and priest salaries.

they like to call us athiests/agnostics a religion, well if we were, we sure do it cheap as fuck.  We dont have or need gawdy buildings or preachers to pay. They should take note. 




 things are actually a [lot more peaceful, our access to info has just increased.](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/21/stu-burguiere/fewer-wars-fewer-people-dying-wars-now-quite-some/)
 




 [tin soldiers and nixons coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GXtQfXBAmM)

edit: i figure the downvoters are youngins or republicans who dont get it. For the people who dont get the reference, this song is about this event.

here is the [wiki on it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_(Crosby,_Stills,_Nash_%26_Young_song\))

its more than famous, and unconscionable it wasnt mentioned in the article.. it became part of the anti war coulture immediately and has been played at anti government protests since it was released.


 




 we sent the probe so long ago... we didnt have enough info to complete the mission when it was launched. We didnt know with enough accuracy where pluto would be in order to capture the closest pictures as we flew by.  Due to its 248 year orbit and only limited data since its discovery.  That blew my mind.. they had to finish working that shit out 




 how does it go, boxing is one of the only sports where you can get arrested for a pick up game in the streets.
 




 and the article debunking it has some .. 'warning signs'

they emailed amazon and asked them to look and see if they saw the bulk sales and amazon said no.. and they say


 casting further doubt on the Times' claim that the book  "A Time for Truth"  had been omitted from its list because sales had been driven by "strategic bulk purchases."

which is odd, since the times claimed they HIRED INDIVIDUALS to do it. they are asking amazon if they have any evidence of a crime that wouldnt leave that type of evidence, if done as alleged.. and claiming "this casts doubt"

its like a newspaper saying, a president of this country was killed by a poison that leaves no traces after 24 hours. and the opposition saying "we autopsied the body 48 hours later and found no sign of said chemical, this furthers puts doubt to the claim he was poisoned"

now we can debate about the evidence the paper has that SAYS he was poisoned, but there should be little debate that the debunking did no such thing.

same in this case.

and not only that it is presented as amazon debunking, rather than a newspaper emailing a spokesperson to look into their database.

its more than week.

Now i would like to see more from the times on this... but the debunkers are using the usual political tricks.


 




 yes we are.. so why didnt you say the same to 

"amazon disagrees"

amazon saying there is no evidence in its database of bulk selling of cruz's book is not the same as saying amazon disagrees that it is happening... or disagrees with the post article at all. Someone asked them and they said no they dont see that in the data.

a heavier weighted statment is from the publisher themselves but even then all they say is they dont have evidence of it.

no this isnt an absence of evidence remark, this is /r/skeptic and amazon did not say they disagreed.


 




 [well we did.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War) We supported saddam and sold him precursors to chemical weapons when he invaded iran giving him radar images of iranian troop movements so he could better gas them. When saddam started to win, we supported iran with the same info, though israel and the iran contra crap. This lead to over a million people dying in 2 countries with about 1/3 the citizens of the us.


we also '[accidentally' shot down an iranian commercial airliner during  gulf 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655), mistaking it for a much much smaller fighter jet. we never even said sorry.

yeah they took some of us hostage for over a year... after taking back their country [which we helped overthrow when they voted in leftist who wanted to nationalize their oil, and instead installed our buddy the shah](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup).. and with him, [we helped start the iranian nuclear program under the 'atoms for peace program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran)

you can say they are a bunch of crazy religious nuts today, but no one can deny that we have been fucking with them hard core for about 100 years now.

Mind you these are all wiki links.

 does the dailyshow work in IE?

whats your flash version in chrome components?

eitherway sounds like malware.

chrome doesnt use adobe flash anymore.. they use pepper.

make sure chromes up to date by goign to the pull down on top right and selecting about chrome.

next time this happens, get screenshots of your components page, and that sketchy site that the click through goes to

 




 the ncaa boycott came from the naacp. which is why it started less than a year later.

we also lost more than NCAA tourneys.. there is a reason why you dont see tiger at the heritage.

we also lost a fuck ton of concerts i suspect you werent interested in.


we lost millions from the boycotts.

but yeah like maurice and his BBQ sauce.. we didnt give a fuck.. but dont pretend it didnt hurt.. it hurt a lot more than NCAA championship games.

 




 no they didnt.

A group released a paper, that isnt wildly accepted yet, that said we are due for an extreme solar min, similar to the one during the "mini ice age" which seemed to only really effect europe and didnt effect the southern hemisphere at all.

now there have been ups and downs of sun spots through out time, and they have always shown, just a very very very minor effect on climate. its real but minor. During the mini iceage there were likely many cooling effects including a quiet sun that all combined to give us the cooler temps. Much like we had a very active sun in 1998 which helped set that record... but since then, we have had a very very quiet sun.. an unusually quiet sun, and yet we are still fucking setting records.

**NOT A SINGLE SCIENTIST ON THE PROJECT EVER USED THE WORDS that a mini ice age MAY start in 15 years**

read the fucking report yourself and not the right winger telegraph interpretation of the report.


and fucking amazing how the denialists think the 'mini ice age' was real and global and the word of god and 100% caused by sun spots,  this is written in diamond.... but all other climate science is a guess and a hoax and a joke. ER.....


anyways this is horse shit, and the raw story should have known better. Not a god damn scientists made this claim. They simply said we havent seen sunspots this low(predicted to come) since the maunder minimum.. and everyone ran with 'scientist say ice age is coming'... not evne close to true.


PS the last time the earths tilt was like it is today... we were in an ice age.

OH MER GERD.

mans influences are stronger than that.. wow.. 

we were actually entering a cooling phase by the tilt cycle that lasted for nearly 2000 years, until... about 150 years ago.. when the industrial age happened.(and yes notice that "mini ice age" happened in that period) But notice back 370 years ago.. what wasnt happening, was man wasnt spewing all this carbon into the air.. ok we spewed a lot but  to even compare how much we spewed back then versus today we would have to have a logarithmic graph because we spew exponentially more than they did back then...


to long didnt read, there is a fucking reason why newyork is surrounding itself with sea walls and florida is surrounding its cities with huge drains and water pumps and why russia put a flag on the sea floor in the arctic and why exxon decided to not exploit a field because it would be the single biggest carbon emitter if they did and they dodnt want that advertisement.
 




 now for actual defence... i dont give a fuck if you like to fuck goats. if someone attacks us, i say give that dude a goat and a gun.
 




 eh if they catch the  throwers.. yeha charge them. People are allowed to be bigots, and people are allowed to call bigots names.. when you start to throw shit, you cross the line from the 'high ground' to the low.

for the "flag run" folks.. yeah it sucks,  and no not defending .. what they did was wrong.. ABSOLUTELY.. they shouldnt have thrown shit at your truck, but also know that if you are an insensitive bigot and drive through minority neighborhoods where people are a bit offended by that flag... well your going to be more likely to have shit thrown at you.. not that it justifies anything but if you purposefully drive through a minority neighborhood trying to provoke this reaction, you too are part of the problem.. not just the people throwing shit.
 




 Of course, robots will need maintenance, controllers and designers. 


which ... WILL.... BE.... DONE... BY ROBOTS.

its already happening. WE have robot coders that are better than human coders at repairing old software.

we got robots making math proofs longer than humans can check.

robots will design robots.

maintenance? lol dont make me laugh thats one of the first robot job that will get automated.


controllers?

does this man even understand the problem?

who controls the electric uber car when i get in and say take me to the airport? oh gps and automation.. there is no "drone driver" the robot IS the controller.

I mean thats kinda all basic, if he doesnt understaand that, he doesnt understand the problem.

I also like his solution is job invention... he also doesnt seem to understand economics or where jobs actually come from.

interesting post of the kind of people we will have to deal with when debating UBI.

I am quite sure he is a highly intelligent fellow. A lot of what he says sounds very reasonable....... ESPECIALLY to people who dont have a clue what tech really is about to bring to us. I dont get how he can understand 'even very highly skilled jobs" will be replaced by robots.. what does he think programmers and designers are? gods? They are highly skilled people, ... who will be replaced by robots. I think he gets doctors will be replaced, well engineers arent magic, or gods.. they are highly trained in fields a lot of people dont understand.. like doctors but there is nothing specifically magical that makes their jobs protected.

Robots will design better robots than a human can.  They will be automatically maintained and will need no controller.  




 and the females generally mate with much younger males, as the males born at the same time as her have long since died... before she even got of age to mate.


and yeah that surprised me they dont "mimic orchids", because they look mighty mighty orchid like to me, but I dont happen to be an insect.

and the whole, shes just as likely to eat you as mate with you and might anyways when your are done...makes dating an interesting affair.

yeah i dont know squat about bugs either, but every once in a while a post will make me go out and get learneded.

dont you know america is full of gangsters and the homeless and gays and nothing else.

You ever watch that awesome movie, Citizen X?

one of the problems they had investigating the serial killer was moscow denied russia had that kind of problem.. that was a problem inherent with the west

and think they are bad.. north korea takes the propaganda cake.

now aint here to claim the opposite, that our shit dont stink, but it is humerous watching other countries claim the same.
 









 they look horribly cheap.

not even sure how they are supposed to hold on.

awesome close ups of the quality.

yeah they look pretty cool, but price is a bit high for a 50 cent toy with a hole in it.
 




 I agree but even for those, its a bit high.

 kinda amateur andy kaufman esc humour maybe.. well the parts andy did where you were pretty sure it was a joke but that you missed the punchline. Not that this rises to the art of kaufman.. but i could see some of the same reactions to it.. you first think its a joke, then you look for a punchline and find none and then you wonder if he is serious.. maybe the prank is on him. And you leave just confused.
 




 i dont see the v3 on there.. can you link? sites not always the best with search

disk manager has all the basics most people need.. but diskpart will help on them rare occasions that disk manager just cant.


 




 unfortunately all you still have is likely conjecture.

A lot of redditors will recognize this, you see a title for an article and your brain, all on its own, invents the wittiest and funniest thing ever.. you click on comments and find it is the top post already. There is 7 billion of us, a lot of thoughts happen independently in many minds, there have even been noted scientific discoveries that happened simultaneously without the two knowing about each other.

but 'life court' tends to not need absolute scientific level proof and your evidence is strong, just remember though, with 99.9% certainty, there is still a 0.1% chance you are wrong. :)
 




 good thing we have wiped out fish populations so much.


swimming 200 years ago would have been much more scary.

 why is this spun ass political horseshit here?

Thats not at all what the 'scientists predict'

Yes some solar scientist do predict a drastic reduction in solar activity and yes  the last time the earth saw this low of solar activity was during the "mini ice age"  which was mainly limited to europe, even the americas while colder wherent in an ice age and the southern poles seemed to completely miss it...and thats where the truth leaves the barn in this article. Sunspot activitiy only mildly effects climate at most.. they have one single event that was highly localized that correlated to a time of almost no spots.. one event.. gee.  AND NO THE SCIENTISTS are not PREDICTING another mini ice age.  So why does this horse shit news article say they do? just like the horse shit article in the telegraph? Because it fuels the denialism. Fuck people you can have your crappy journalism, but at least get the fucking basics right. No one fucking predicted no god damn ice age.

**NO some political fucking rag, looked at some scientists data, and decided they were going to be arm chair 'scientists'' er denialists and decided to interpret the shit for themselves, and then tell everyone thats what the scientists said.**

This has no business being here. Its denialist horse shit.
 




 I really would like to see the left avoid making this political. Yeah the right already has, but we should link to the studies only.

what to do about it... yeha that is pure politics. But if it is happening and the science.. fuck no. You either accept reality or you dont. Science doesnt give a flying fuck about how you feel or your political orientation. Science can be a major prick that way.. just ask einstein.

but yeah i think we need to focus on pointing out that the record in 2014 that we got and the one we will likely set this year, was caused by cars and factories in 1974. It was caused by your grandparents and parents.. in a world WITH HALF AS MANY PEOPLE.

now think of the 70s.. no one had computers in the home.. you had a big ass tv.. if you were lucky there was a long ass wire attached to a little box with one big ass button on it.. that button changed the channel in the clockwise direction... that was it. There was less cars.. jet skis, boats.. less shit shipping from china.

today we got twice as many people, we use the fuck out of elect.. does anyone have a plug in their house without a an adaptor or strip to give you more sockets? how the fuck did people survive with these 2 socket pos's? they didnt use fuck for electricity.

so we got double the people.. i got fucking computer screens all over the house, when in the 70s we had one fucking tv.. one of my favority toys.. a cap gun, used no batteries.. and all that lame ass shit we did back then.. helped cause the record in 2014. Think of the people in your family in 1974.. what did thye look like, what did they do.. how did they live.. think of your life now.. if you went back in time they would think you were a fucking wizard.. ok the whole going back in time thing is a little cool, but the shit you got. You carry a library and gps and weather checker and tv watcher in your pocket.. dick tracy would jizz all over himself for one of our smart phones.

Now.. your emissions today.. all this lame ass crap we got..(in 40 years they are going to laugh at our quaint little smart phones and the shit we think is cool).. population growth.. electricity growth.. emission growth.. your emissions are going to set records for grandkids you havent even met yet.

 




 right wingers really are a huge problem in the world today.

oh they have their uses. I'm a strong believer that both sides keep society in check.. the left are a bit too willing to look without leaping and the right are a bit too scared to leap.. together we make good choices about when to leap.


Unfortunately, society has been a bit right winger for a long time and we have a bit many problems that are antithesis to right winger ideology. Like AGW... and well when your plane is crashing and you all got parachutes.. the guy telling you to not jump is a fucking idiot and a problem. "maybe we will have a soft landing.. maybe we will land on a pile of cottom.. maybe someone will come up with a way to save the plane before it hits the ground.. we should stay here"

yeah crash and burn right wingers, just dont take the world with you.

and when yall come back to sanity, we really do need you guys.... but we need yall sane. hey use lefties have to run into that all the time.. there are some shit that we would like that just isnt affordable or doable.. thing is we generally accept that. Yall got to accept that sometimes, taxes HAVE to be raised and its nothing to do with a bunch of lazy fucks. Sometimes we have to go against your ideology.. yeah it sucks balls sometimes I KNOW.. but yall got to grin and bear it and prove your fucking adults and do the right fucking thing and by right I dont mean political right.

 




 The big reason is the rise of compensation negotiators. And the fact that boards tend to be filled with other ceos. Scratch my back and i will scratch yours.

but yeah compensation negotiators see joe smo getting more than his client at a similar sized company and works out a massive deal

and the growth feeds on each other. Keeping up with the jones.(and really once your bills are paid, thats some of the 'worries' the rich have.. i need a bigger boat than my neighbor.. i need a better car. When my family built a home in a gated community that came out 3 inches taller than the neighbor.. they had their entire house raised by 6.. he didnt add shit.. not a loft or another floor.. he just raised his fuckin house 6 inches so it was the tallest on the block again. it must be nice to have such frivolous concerns.. and high school can be brutal on the barely rich, especially girls)

and what actually kicked things into overdrive recently.. was reporting requirements. now the negotiators have a much easier time seeing compensation across the board so they can work out even more for their ceo clients.


This is one of those times, when ALL MARKET FORCES.. you know that magical free market beast.. which ZERO GOVERNMENT encouragement(except that last part with the reporting.. but it sure as fuck didnt start this mess)... ALL market forces encourage this. 

Absolutely zero in the free markets, want to stop the insane growth in ceo pay.. nothing.. in fact the exact opposite.

now with those immutable facts in mind... what do you think would be the best thing to do about this?

because you can pray to the free market fairy to fix this, but the free market fairy is right now cheering them on "PAY EM MORE!.. PAY EM MORE!!"
 




 send it back.. they'll take it.. you will get more free
 




 its [because the bottom doesnt know its been dropped yet](http://i.imgur.com/xfabuCc.gif) ;) 




 mister skeltal seems to have been dooting in /r/mildlypenis 









 On our side of the wall... perkers versus advertisers.. its going to be useless to contact CS.


in the start of these things, sometimes, user CS is ok.. because they need mass to start getting good ad contracts, after that, we are assigned to automation and the worst employee they got. Its just market forces. If your question is more complicated than asking how to spell perk, your better off not contacting them.  they have no compelling reason to give us good support, we are outgoing money.


anyways you are better off here. they know their shit is crashing. if it is phone/user specific, people can often help here.. well sometimes, which is 1000% more than perk support.
 




 not really that mild but i doubt they would care

/r/mildlypenis  would enjoy.. they seem to really like this sort of thing 




  it's become common to quiz both men and women about their credentials and boasting is a given.

,

The late-night talk show host Conan O'Brien, who is broadcasting live from the convention, boasted that he knows more than any fan and even took a "Comic-Con citizenship test" on his show answering questions like: "Wolverine's claws are made of which metal?"



that second part had nothing to do with them being women. well let me dial that back a little, i have seen women get more scrutiny in the past, (not at comic con, just general girls claiming to be geeks) a little less so today, so dont doubt it happens some, but the article says both go through that.
