 Close, upstate NY wedding at my buddy's farm.  Little Falls 









 Cry me a river 




 Learn to make your FT's, and stop pretending you're a 3 PT shooter.  Then you can start talking about winning.   




 This is just my guess, but I think it's b.c school is out now.  Ignorant, immature kids are bored, and have more time to be online.  




 Cheers thanks 




 I'm hoping for some guidance on some books/courses that can steer me in the right direction for a Product Manager gig in the Pharma industry.  My background is in pharma sales, and I'm trying to get into the marketing aspect.  One of the requirements in Affiliate Implementation.  I know this might be a shot in the dark, but if anyone has idea, please share.  Thank you 




 Plus the line in the beginning saying no clinician wanted to see him.   Gimme a break, doctors wanna get paid just like anyone else.    




 I usually sear after sous vide.   




 Hey Hey!!!  Jokes aside, recipe please?   




 Was wondering if there's any books to learn on affiliate marketing, especially within pharma.   




 Try explaining that to others in your sub. Gone are the days where you have to be in LA/NY.  You can film a commercial anywhere these days 




 [HAHA](http://nelson-haha.api-meal.eu/) 




 That's funny bc laker fans weren't using that excuse when they first signed GP and Malone.  My point is Kobe has had help in the past and still lost in the Finals 




 Did you forget the 2004 team?  Kobe had 3 other HOFers and couldn't get it done.  




 If your still hung up on trying to trade Kaep, or conjure up a trade scenario, you might wanna reassess your fanhood.  




 The Buddhist symbol faces the opposite away of the swastika, most people assume they're the same

 That's why I have hard time believing r\food posts anymore.  And, this isnt legit yakiaoba.  Never seen ketchup used as a sauce 




 It's b.c school is out now.  Combine that with boredom and you get a shit show. It's been happening more and more every year 




 Kelly Dwyer is the worst 




 He sounded like a 5 year old many times during the post game conferences.   




 Way to bounce back Festus, and contribute big time in the Final game.   




 At no point did your comment make any sense.  Easy triple double?  Best oxymoron ever 




 The entire team is a bunch of outcasts.  Dray getting drafted in the 2nd, Bogut and his multiple injuries, Steph being too small.   




 Fuck yeah!!!!!!! 




 You're comparing a tweet to a post game press conference.   Literally millions of people are watching this.  This particular answer mad him sound whiny  




 It's called being a pro and and answering questions professionally.   




 Sounds like my 5 y.o nephew.   




 I saw one wearing the traditional garb, but wearing a Mets hat.   




 Recipe please 




 I have a hard time understanding your logic.  Your list has only 1 mention of kap. The rest of your list has to do with a new O line, weak secondary. 




 Yesterday's game reminded me game 2 vs Memphis.  We got flustered, and panicked a bit on shot selection.   









 It shows just how badly we was dinged up last year.  He had a bum shoulder as well that probably wasn't healing the way it wanted.   




 La Quinta inn K town.  Spectacular view of the Empire State and delicious Korean food all around you  




 No way, but I did live in Alameda so my commute was literally 10 minutes.  Although they sucked really bad those days, it was still really fun to go to games.  

Back then you could by a upper level ticket, wait till the 3rd quarter when it was a blowout, sneak down to lower level and watch the games.  The closest I snuck down was right behind the bench.   




 Great question.  When GS was shitty during the 2000's, there weren't really SF Warrior fans.  There was a handful that would make the commute, but for the most part, the crowd was East Bay.  

Fast forward to present day, the crowd these days is way more SF.  Also because ticket prices have increased.   




 One of the papers commented that this is one of the most expensive finals to date.  Whenever you have Lebron tix are going to go up.  




 Love this kids logic.  Has no f'n clue about Steve Kerr's dad, yet will argue as to who killed him.   




 Just wondering what's everyone thoughts are 




 I've heard splash daddy used for Kerr in the Warriors sub before 




 That post was entertaining, there was so much drama that day. Didnt the model from the actual photo show up and tried to ask for royalties? 




 Can we ask the mods to shadow ban? 




 He's posting on redsox quite a bit as well.  Even r/redsox is telling him to delete his account 




 I won't tell you to kill yourself, but I'll tell you to fuck off.  What are you still doing in this sub?  

And for y'all that think that's rude.. I'll tell you why it's not.  Some of the subreddits have changed in the past few years bc of lies and false posts.  Look at r/food for instance.  All u see these days is stock photos with watermarks cropped out, and people claiming they actually made it.  

The warriors sub has always been legit.  Then this charlatan comes along into our sub and trolled the shit out of us.  I don't want this guy around, pretty sure the majority does either  




 Well he's gonna get down voted if he ever tries to post, so I'm cool with that 




 Sorry, I don't share the same sentiment.  I avoid subreddits like r\food because people started to post stock photos claiming it was thier own creation.  Reddit wasn't like this 4 years ago.  It was genuine posts from real folks.  It's changed now and sometimes for the worse.  I wasn't expecting any frauds to, certainly not on this sub..  

So yeah, fuck OP 




 This if borderline psychopath.  




 Hope this makes it onto best of Reddit.  Frontpage 









 Damn man, it's guys like you that have ruined Reddit.  The past 2-3 years this place got more popular and then shitheads like you discovered Reddit.  "Hey derp, look how cool I am!".

You got some fucking issues.  Maybe you got picked on too much in High school, not enough pussy, who knows.  But go fuck off, you should be banned from r\warriors.   




 Thanks I find it hilarious the lengths people go to post stock images on here.  All I wanted to know was whether OP made it or not.  Even funnier that he got gold.   




 I stopped lurking on r/food bc people started posting stock photos of food pics claiming they made it rather than giving credit to the original.  Never would i imagined this level of attention seeking would come to this subreddit 




 Playoff ball is much slower, grind it out pace.  After watching that Bogut video posted here, I was thinking the same.  That said, Mosgov is quick on his feet and can keep up with Bogut 




 So do you always post glamor pics w/out context?  Where is this from, recipe?  Did you make this? 




 And one day you might end up missing, and some shithead will make a similar comment such as yours, during a time when their friends and family are pleading with the public.   




 Yeah let's dismiss the playoff game in Atlanta, or outgunning Brady in Foxborough, or handling Carolina in the playoffs.  

 




 More like rye bread.  Dark on the outside, light in the inside  




 The debate was never about Harden sucking.  It was whether he worthy of winning the MVP over Curry.  Unfortunately critics will be using game 5 as an example  




 3 of us tried our hardest and couldn't finish it  




 Oven baked salmon and sable fish.  In the bowl is a potato salad, served with rye, pumpernickel, and of course bagels 









 Seemed as though in the 2nd half, Fez had more of a impact than Bogut.  Other than foul trouble, and Howard being hurt, do you think Ezeli is the better play?  

Just for clarification, this is not to trash Bogut.   




 Separate sticks  




 Pro tip:  separate the meats and veggies when skewering.  You can run risk of cross contamination and veggies cook much faster so you won't run the risk of over cooking  




 2011 Justin Smith was a piece of work, lotta of the highlights of him as a 49er were that year.  That being said, I felt like last year there was a slight drop off with him.  Of course I would want him back, but it creates urgency and guys like Aldon have been stepping up big time.  It's hard to tell yet, but I think our D Line will still produce 




 Dwight Howard, Kobe, CP....  Oh wait sorry  




 Contact your local chapter to find out if they have a goverment prorgram.  Also talk to your social worker at your HTC 




 My Mom and Dad always thought Turkey was so dry and bland.  Granted we overcooked the bird on occasion, but overall they didn't really get why American's had such as obsession over Turkey on Thanksgiving.   




 Assuming most of Reddit is young folks, but I always likened Barnes games to Jamal Mashburn.  Very similar post game, both are 6'8.  Mash had a better jumper, but Barnes ceiling is way higher.  Here's a [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS2B_5wDU6U)

 




 I think in time he"ll find that mid range jumper.  What's nuts is that he's still bulking up, and could be a solid post threat later down the road.   




 It's another scoring option that Memphis has to pay attention to, especially if Barnes is posting Courtney lee.  Its gotta be demoralizing when you spend all your energy on trying to stop Steph and Klay, and then having Harrison come down the lane for a 2 handed dunk  




 I agree, he's only going to get better.  People forget how young he is.   




 Barnes sometimes gets heat for not being more consistent, but he was a beast in game 4.  Some of his post moves looked eerily similar to his breakout series against the Spurs a few years ago.  He's also had 4-5 monster dunks last game 




 Who gives a shit?  As long as we play our game, the refs will have no impact 




 Winning on the road is a must for championship teams.  The lakers in the early 2000s were down 2-1 in series many times and we all know how that ended.  No need to panic, I expect a game 7 




 Harrison looked real solid, I'm surprised they didn't run more Iso through him, especially when Lee was guarding him 




 You hit it straight on, I think the MVP presentation before the game got the team too hyphy.  They were jacking up quick shots, not enough ball movement.   




 How many times is that now?  3 times accused of cheating 




 Why is this considered justice?  DUI manslaughter is punishable to up to 30 years, this girl got 24.   




 Not trying to be biased by age, but it's because r/nba is filled with immature kids 14-19 y.o.

 




 I'm so EXCITED!!! 




 Dude really original taking the Mr Rogers quote and slapping a picture on it.   Just a few hours earlier same quote different pic  




 You got a bunch of mods that think they're the shit, when clearly people are unhappy on this sub.  I messaged the mods asking the other day why my post was pulled. I got no answer.  Bitch move in my opinion.  Man up and answer a simple fucking question.  




 Asian guy checking in.  Anytime I check out a Yelp review on a asian restaurant, I look at the face+name of the reviewer.  An asian face usually gets a little more cred.  




 When you got 2 of the biggest whiners in the game i.e Paul and Griffin, those technicals add up fast  




 Checking in from NYC!   




 Bet she wishes she never released those tapes 














 Chris Paul has also flopped in all 82 games  




 He would never see playing time in golden state.  Kerr would yank his ass in a heartbeat  




 Are these worth any $$? 




 How many more coaches are you guys going to hire and then fire?  A few years ago it was Mike Brown, then D'Antoni.  Funny how some of you would kill to have either of these guys back as coaches.   




 It's that and a combination of the biggest 2 floppers in the league i.e Paul and Griffin. 

 How is it that a power forward as big as Griffin is always on the ground?  And follow that up with Paul's whiny ass always getting tangled up with everyone?  Then these 2 have the nerve to bitch and complain.  That's why people are getting fed up with their shit and the act entitled 




 Thabo better good a good immigration attorney.  These kinds of acts can get you sent back to Switzerland 




 The guy has never worn pads or helmet, it's going to take some time getting used to.   




 Hey, fellow WVD!  When I was diagnosed at birth, my parent's didn't get too involved, but as I got older I wanted to learn everything there is to know.  I also used to work for NHF, so if you have any questions, feel free to PM me.  

[National Hemophilia Foundation](http://www.hemophilia.org/Bleeding-Disorders/Types-of-Bleeding-Disorders) is a good start to understand the basics as well as other bleeding disorders.  Also, you can 1.800.42.HANDI and ask for any VWD educational info.  They will send it to you free of charge

I would also contact your local chapter depending on what city/state you live in.  They will be a good resource for you depending on the types of programs they offer. 

If you don't know yet, you must learn to self infuse.  Your HTC should teach you this.  

I'm sure other people in this sub will chime in.  Good luck and no worries 




 Check out r/ramen when you get a chance  




 What a bitch 




 I think Lee's liability on defense will limit his minutes esp come playoff time.  Going against Aldridge, Ibaka, Duncan, etc he's going to be outmatched.  Also the pace of playoff basketball slows down to a lot more to half court sets, which is another knock against Lee.   




 While walking up to the podium to announce his retirement, CP3 flopped 




 Juke of the year? 




 Let's go all the way.  FUCK LA! 




 Try using that logic in Williamsburg with the Shomririm 




 No TDs scored in the 4th quarter all season  









 Just wondering why everyone keeps asking for the "full" story.  It's as if the reasons BBC gave weren't good enough.  On other posts, people are claiming the producer lied 




 If this went down in the US, there's no chance in hell he'd ever work again.  Possibly overseas, but he'd be finished in the US.  No network would ever want to be scrutinized for his hiring 




 It's hard to speak a language when your mouth if full of shit 




 You should stop by r/food.  Its stock photos galore, sometimes people will crop out the water mark to claim as their own.   




 You forgot to mention asshole, since that's what spews out your fucking mouth.  Say it with me, "ASSHOLE" 




 Look, Reddit has gone to shit these days, and it's because fake mother fuckers like you.  I've been on this 4+ years, and once in awhile there would be a fake pic here and there.  These days, it's everywhere.  Take R/Food for instance.  It's so fake b.c of fuckers like you that it should re named R/Stockphoto.  

And get off your fucking soapbox regarding what Reddit should be.  I'm not about to get lectured from some fuckwit.   




 I'll say it like this.  Reddit has gone to shit lately b.c of these exact posts.  R/Food became R/stockphoto because people automatically assumed OP made the food.  This wasn't so 4+ years ago, where I could see actual food posts that were real.  Just a few weeks ago, the top posts on r/food were all stock.  No description, background info, nothing.     




 Damn man/woman, is your self esteem that fucking low?  That's a rhetorical question.  What the fuck is wrong with you?   Reddit has gone to shit lately, and its b.c of punk asses like you.  Go fuck yourself.  Plus now everyone knows your shit username.  Good luck creating another account so you can post more fake picsc
