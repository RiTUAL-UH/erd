 Oh ffs, she would be so embarassed.  




 Also, apple tax? 




 I was definitely hoping to avoid them.  




 It's a waste IMO. I was in architecture school and for the same price as the art school's lab, ours had high end Dell XPS towers 




 Thanks! As with most art majors, she'll be very leary of this but, maybe I could change her mind and save her some money at the same time.  




 Her current is pathetic by all means. 2gb ram, 256mb video card, 2.26 Intel core duo 




 I would definitely need ya'll's help with that. I've actually never even heard of that. 




 She is in an art program and that is what the department requires.. idiotic I know.. 




 She has a very out dated macbook '09 era. I've been looking at new ones for her and I'm confused as to why a: the new macbook pro's have dual core processors and b: why is the processing power around 1.2ghz? What sort of windows laptop would be comparable? Since she is required to have a mac, what ( in your opinion ) would pose the best value?
Thanks, and many apologies for posting in the master race. You guys would have a much greater knowledge than that of other subs. 




 I, normally, am serving at the waitress well of the bar I work at and continually have a line of regulars (mostly good, some bad) that will wait their turn because I give respect to each and every customer and, as much as possible, speedy service. I can't remember most of their names but I know exactly what they drink. 




 As a fellow bartender, I completely agree with that entire statement.
