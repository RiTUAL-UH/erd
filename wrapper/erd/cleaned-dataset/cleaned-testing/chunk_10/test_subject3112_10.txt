 I was 12 years old, never did drugs, but I encountered a very malicious presence in my grandmother's house.  

It wasn't something I could see, but no matter how much I tried to convince myself I was just crazy and there wasn't actually anything there, the presence felt like pure evil and *made* my body react in such a way that I became filled with terror and flight.  My rational mind was literally just like what the ever loving fuck is going on?  

I've heard of people who have a certain instinct that tells them something is wrong when they can't actually discern what it is, and this was just one of those times.  My body and instincts were telling me to *get the fuck away* from whatever was there, except that it was blocking the only doorway out of the kitchen.

Nothing happened, but it felt like it wanted to kill me.  It irrationally made me fear for my safety in a certain way.  The part that really cemented the idea of it being a demon of some sort instead of a panic attack, was that the feeling of apprehension and fear within me *didn't gradually wear off.  Its exit was as instantaneous as it had come*.  I didn't realize just how heavy the atmosphere had felt until 'it' left.  The room then felt so light again, and I was filled with relief.

I imagine the whole ordeal probably would have looked like I was insane to an outsider; I was crying and praying to god and trying to melt into the back counter.  It was both the strangest and scariest thing that has ever happened to me in my life.  

The experience itself *did* happen to me.  The part that nobody would believe is that it was a demon.  I can't tell you with fact that it was a demon, but I can tell you that it felt like there was a malicious presence there, and I personally associate the idea of a 'malicious presence' with a demon.  I guess it could have been some kind of temporary, one time, vivid emotional hallucination.  I don't know.  I don't go chasing after ghosts and the supernatural.  Nothing like that has ever happened again, thankfully.   




 YOU BOYS LIKE MEXICO? **YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO** 




 I felt like Gates to Infinity pandered either to children or casual gamers.  I hated how I couldn't take multiple missions in one dungeon like in the previous games, *I mean why the fuck not?*  It made gathering materials a slow and painful process.  Plus they literally just made it waaaaaay too easy to get rich and get good items in that game.  I agree the storyline was too short and not as compelling as the previous games.

They better not skimp out on this new game that's coming out, I will be so pissed.   




 [This item.](http://items.jellyneo.net/?go=itemshowitem=7108)  The item description totally brings it together.  xD 




 I changed all the passwords and pins of my side accounts and main to completely separate ones for now, and I've deleted all traces of linking to my side accounts on my main just in case.  I've also checked the plain text neomail and login birthday prompt in site preferences.  I haven't talked to anyone on the boards lately and haven't neomailed anyone, and have bought a limited amount of items from user shops (a little risky, but I still need to complete quests).  And deleted cookies.  So far, my accounts are okay...  But I hate being careful like this  x_x

EDIT:  By the way... why is this happening *now*?  I get when it happened while neopets was still a relatively popular site, but I would not expect such tomfoolery to occur when the site is dying.  It seems to have come out of nowhere... unless it is a result of people realizing after the neopocalypse that they can do whatever the fuck they want?  _; 




 Oh yeah, *black liquorice*, another candy I hate  :P 




 I'm glad too, I really thought I was weird and alone on this.  :'D 




 My hope is that I can apply my imagination into creative outlets.  I can imagine things so vividly, but when it comes to actually writing, that is where I am perfectionist.  I'm a very good writer, just not with creative writing.  Creative writing involves exploring life in a realistic aspect.  I can't just make all my characters perfect like I can in my head, because that isn't good writing lol.  Being a good writer allows me to see how much I suck at writing creatively.   




 Hey man, my imagination falls along the same lines!  My favorite fantasies involve saving the day and rescuing my imaginary friends with my mysterious superpowers.  Well, I will admit I find this childish of myself, but only because I am so self-critical.  But you can at least have the comfort of knowing you aren't alone in this aspect.  c:   




 Do you think it's because our daydreams are like an idealized version of reality?  For me, it's a place where I am far stronger than I really am; that's the most important part.  I find myself looking toward society with a certain degree of apprehension.  I notice a lot of conflict and discord.. so being able to retreat within myself provides a sort of safe covering from society and a sort of buffer from my social anxiety.  

I look at myself in reality and am disappointed with the person I have become.  The person in my daydreams has lots of friends but minus the conflict... but they're also super idealized versions of people, people that just can't exist.  Wishing for things that can't exist is quite exhausting, I agree.  I want to be willing to accept reality, but it seems very far off right now.
