 Before the Alou brothers came along, there was a joke about how many wins brothers who pitched in the major leagues had together, that "Cy Young and his sister have them all beat." 




 "There was also a large horse in the room, taking up most of it." 




 I had two Skype interviews for a job last year and put on a full suit for both, even dress shoes. I didn't have to prove it, but I did get the job. 




 The "professional-looking dude not wearing pants" thing is sort of a comedy trope; it's been applied to news anchors, judges, etc. If either party is a woman then the under- and overtones shift too far. When it's just guys then it can work if employed advisedly. 




 A couple of years ago I met a recruiter at a conference and we hit it off immediately. At some point he asked me a somewhat personal question and I answered without a flinch. Then he said, "I probably also shouldn't ask this, but are you wearing panties?"

I said, "Who told you about my panties?" and he busted out laughing.

The job and I weren't right for each other, but I would have loved working with that guy. 




 I once heard a woman who did photo sets and videos say she got a request for a custom set of pix of her bare foot on the accelerator of a fast sports car. Nothing else, just a bunch of shots like that. She said she threw in a nude pic just because it seemed strange not to. 




 At the gym:

Me: I'm doing pretty good for an old fat guy.

Young woman: You're not old! 




 Hahaha I told some friends tonight about this thread and then said "Some--" and three of them started singing "-body once told me" right away. 




 I loved the approach of one of my friends when her first grandbaby arrived: "I'm not showing any photos because she just looks like all the other babies. I'll wait till she looks more individual."

 "He's a really nice guy, he's never cheated on his wife before, he wants to be with me instead of her, he's just waiting for her to ask for a divorce."

 What I love about that song is that so often people agree that it uses "irony" wrong but don't agree on how to use it correctly.

 Yes! Also, mix it with baking soda and a little crushed oregano and it's a good underarm antiperspirant/deodorant. I tried this combo in the downstairs region too, but it seemed to cause irritation so I switched back to just cornstarch for that area.

 I saw something similar with a bicycle chained to a post. IIRC the white guy got ignored, the black guy got the cops called on him (and harassed in the meantime), the white woman got helped. 




 I had a similar experience as I finished college -- the CIA has lots of non-secret jobs collecting and analyzing data, and they were on campus interviewing for some of them. It seemed pretty normal. At the time the job didn't seem all that interesting and I didn't have the wits to see it as an entry to more engaging stuff, so I never pursued it. 




 Muffin Paul. Something tells me I won't get the action-hero roles. 




 It is quite subtle, in fact; it actually *means* "Bless your heart." 




 This. I think of grapes as sugar pills. 




 Wow, no matter how long I watch it I only see two cycles. 




 I read a lot about the online world before I could afford a computer, so my introduction was gradual; I knew a couple of people on BBSs and they showed me around a little.

Funny story: While gathering information I learned about the WELL, so I called their office (this would be about '94) and asked someone to send me an info packet. He sounded very apologetic when he said "I'll be sending this through the mail, so it will take a couple of days to reach you. Is that OK?" 




 Linguistics overlaps with anthropology, but it's not a subset of it. We can use each one to understand the other better, which is way cool. 




 I speak some French, and when I first saw Kreyol written down it was pretty much the same experience. 




 The main characters in *Orphan Black*. Seriously, more than once I've watched the credits and wondered why they left out several of the actresses. 




 This will probably not be seen, but ... someone said something interesting to me along these lines, relating to a discussion about young people's impressions of 9/11: that we miss out on that gray area between current events and taught history that happens in our youth.

 Adults don't usually talk to kids about the news of the day, and news sources aren't usually very accessible to children. And by the time those things are set down in history books, a microgeneration has missed learning about them. Then by the time the child is adult, no other adult is going to say to them, "Let's discuss the history and context of 9/11."

My high school history classes said little about the Vietnam War, and most of what I "learned" in later years came from movies; if Hollywood hadn't mined that vein so thoroughly I probably still would be in the dark about it.* People born in the mid-1970s probably know little to nothing about the Reagan era, which was a very formative period for me. And so on. And as far as I know we don't examine these generational lacunae much, if at all.

*as opposed to mostly knowing the movie version, which is just a different form of ignorance. 




 Thanks for the details! I couldn't remember what it's called. Obviously you don't see it used in typewriters much anymore, of course, but you're right, it's still common for other things. 




 What /u/spacejack_ said: Sony didn't license the Betamax format to other companies, so if you wanted a Beta player you had to buy Sony. JVC licensed the VHS format so anyone could make one, and competition pushed prices down.

For years after Betamax left the consumer market it was still in wide use in video production. Until digital video finally won out, if you saw a TV news crew on the street they probably had Betamax cameras.

The same dynamic happened between Apple and Microsoft in the 1980s; Apple's products were better in a lot of ways, but they were the only source, so for a long time they were just a niche player. 




 I thought it was called the whump-whump. 




 When cassettes started getting popular in the early 1980s the 8-track died out pretty quickly. My sister, a year older than me, had an 8-track player, but I never did. 




 Operators didn't provide recommendations, but in the '80s I heard ads for phone services of that nature. Never used one myself so I can't say more about them. 




 There is such a thing (besides carbon paper), two or three sheets attached together at one end like Post-Its, with something on the back of the top one that creates the image of the letters on the bottom one. You still see this with handwritten receipts where you get a copy and the business keeps one; they're usually different colors, white and yellow and, if there's a third one, pink. Duplicate bank checks, too. 




 That was fun, yes.  




 That's an interesting point, that the Ferengi in DS9 were the atypical ones, which did make them interesting as characters in the context of the series. But every time the setting shifted to Ferengenar it was just painful. I get that they wanted Quark and Rom to have some sort of depth and character arcs, but this just seemed farcical and didn't really respect them. 




 Also true. 




 I was going to say "Every Ferengi episode" but that doesn't even qualify as an interesting concept. The Ferengi are OK in episodes where they're antagonists, but the on-world political and Quark's-family crap was unbearable. 




 Very much agreed. I thought new-BSG was what Voyager should have been. And their resources were actually nearly unlimited -- "We have a full complement of shuttles." Really? They keep getting destroyed and you just replicate more?

I also thought Year of Hell would have made a great Doctor Who arc with the payoff happening by design instead of accidentally. 




 Sneakers. Most underrated spy/caper movie ever. 




 "Let's go to Dunkin Donuts when other options are available." 




 Sorry to be late replying. My university had an Office of Study Abroad and I basically walked in and asked what was available. If your school doesn't have something like that, ask a professor of your favorite foreign language what resources they know about. 




 Make plans to study abroad. A full year would be best, but a semester or even just a month will do you a world of good (literally). I did a year in France and gained a hell of a lot of perspective on my life and other people's. 




 This also ensures that the prof knows you by name and face, so if you ever need a letter of reference for a scholarship or internship, the prof will be able to provide one. If you're just another name and row of test scores on the roster, forget it. 




 Can sort of confirm. I once was stuck at the airport when my flight was delayed and finally canceled till the next day. The only hotel with a room was a Marriott ("When You're Stuck At The Airport, You're Stuck With Us"), and the nice desk person seemed to really really not want to charge me the full rate, but I didn't have anything that gave a discount (no AAA etc.). Clearly she had virtually no flexibility from the bosses. She did comp my breakfast buffet the next morning, I guess that counts as an upgrade.  




 Yep, they're in the hipster parts of Austin. I realize that's not everyone's idea of a "great" neighborhood, but it's not unsafe like the point of the thread. 




 [Disappointing Gay Best Friend](http://disappointinggaybestfriend.tumblr.com/) is hilarious. 




 Edited it down to five. 




 In my hometown whenever there was some big event with crowds, this one guy would dress up as Waldo and just go there and walk around. Kids loved "finding" him. 




 I never send personal email on my work account, and I generally don't send it through any other account from my work computer and don't use the office Wi-Fi. Same with Reddit and Facebook. I must look a bit odd checking email on my phone at my desk, but I like the compartmentalization. These seem like simple precautions, but I can't believe how many people do that stuff. 




 Empire State Building. 




 Singular they. 




 mmm petrichor 




 These, only the miniature ones. I once brought a bag to work for occasional bites. At some point I thought "Well, I should stop eating these and save the leftover ... three?? ... for later." 




 Eh. I've taken Greyhound a lot, and I have no horror stories. My fellow passengers have tended to be among the downtrodden, but they have generally been nice folks. The main problems have been with the bus itself -- breaking down, running late, etc. And that doesn't happen all that often.

Now, I finally quit taking the bus once when I traveled to Nebraska in December and a blizzard hit the entire Great Plains; I had to stay days longer than I had planned because even after the roads were cleared, the "upstream" highways were still closed and the buses couldn't get there.

I still take the bus for short hops, like NYC-DC. 




 No one has said J-Law? She's incredibly talented and gets great roles. 




 Came here to say this. Sooo powerful. 




 Mine too, now. Kind of amazing, really.
