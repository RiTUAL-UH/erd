 From the sidebar, he is Scheduled for an AMA here

 Ray Billings - Tombstone - July 22nd 10PM ET / 7PM PT 




 Removed as a consideration for others.  Even though you used spoiler tags, they don't work on mobile devices.  If you want to talk about this better to use a spoiler flared post with a title describing the nature of what you are speculating here but not actually revealing anything..    

e.g. This post seems good for heavy speculation around teasers and trailers
https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3dzrwf/potential_spoilerdid_abc_show_us_the_winner/ 














 Our automoderator kills low karma accounts to fight problem users.   I've manually approved your comment here and will do so as I see them.  You may have this problem in a lot of subreddits.  So better go karmawhore or get a new account! 




 Someone try and mention /r/Battlebots. It was kind of missing from the last two /r/IAMA.   It is always good to get some fresh-blood from the defaults visiting here.  I have a feeling this AMA might do well given the excitement from the last episode. 




 This sub is for discussing public information around battlebots.    If people want to post a reaction after something has been broadcast, I can't see any problem with that and encourage it.   

The only time spoiler flairs are really  used and people are asked to be  careful about titles is when people are discussing trailers and teasers leading upto the  broadcast of an episode.   

Other spoilers like results of matches gleaned from inside information are prohibited.

 




 It shouldn't be.  There is a spoiler flair for that.  I don't even think it is was a  spoiler as it appeared after the broadcast.  So removed it now anyway 




 Thank for posting. If you want to advertise a live stream , I would prefer you do it in the comments of the live thread or other comment sections.  

full episode streaming links tend to get removed as posts because they don't support a discussion.  Your post here is now removed .    




 You posted this 7 days ago.  I tend not to allow posts that are direct links to episodes whatever the source as they don't create a discussion.  So  feel free to post about it in comments as a response to requests.

 Definately qualifies for the "robot combat" flair 




  I'm not harping on about official videos

fair enough. Maybe i should have directed it at the OP.  I'm just a bit wary of a sentiment I see emerging on here that the nature of the source is important.  People have virtually stopped sharing current video clips in recent weeks and I blame it on a mild jerk about sticking to the official stuff.

 I just said that I don't think it is.

The link here is definitely the official youtube of the battle bot creators. 

You can see it link from :

http://battlebots.com/

https://www.facebook.com/battlebots

https://www.twitter.com/battlebots

https://www.youtube.com/user/battlebots
etc.  

Thankfully, the battlebot creators are good enough to make their stuff avialable to all countries.

abc who bought the series do their own marketing and have their own youtube, twitter etc complementing it.
    
https://www.youtube.com/user/ABCNetwork

https://twitter.com/battlebotsabc

 

 




 The production ideas it is something they will improve on for another season.   

https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3ax944/contacted_battlebots_was_not_disappointed/

I see the whole "reactions" thing is an attempt at emulating shows like x-factor and america's got talent.  It reminds me of canned laughter from 1980's comedies.   




 I think it is a rehash of quotes from elsewhere and not an actual new interview ? 




 It would never happen except for where they could close betting before filming took place.  Getting a betting company involved as a sponsor might be cool for a robotwars reboot outside the US.   




 No idea. One thing I understand is that he is an american role playing and I believe it is filmed in the US.  Makes it more weird because there must be some kind of regulations around some of the stuff he does.  .. that drone is an example..  




 Who is watching battlebots ?

^(shameless plug /r/battlebots) 




 meanwhile in russia 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNPJMk2fgJU

(drone+automatic weapon) 




 They look like filler clips that got cut from the show rather than standalone youtube features.   




 Your links aren't internationally accessible nor specific and I don't think those videos are  there .  People harping on about official videos will destroy the discussion on this small subreddit.  This subreddit does a lot of good for creating the hype that encourages people to watch the show live when they can.  It really doesn't matter what the source of the clips are.  As you can tell, I am more bothered about content contributors being hounded  or worrying too much about their sources.

For what its worth,   the OP here has posted links to the official youtube channel of the battlebots creators .    




 The prototype looks all wrong with 4 small jets on each tower.   Don't think I believe this kickstarter but interested in the concept as a consumer product.

Remind me of a big version of Philips AMBX which wasn't a success - particularly the fans addon 



















  The sub is absolutely for anything competitive robots and robot combat related.   

There are some links to databases and organisations in [the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/wiki/
)

If you find something better, please add them as it is user editable.
 




 the link is  a user editable wiki.   So if you are so inclined, you can add it or someone else may. 




 From variety

 And while most of it is meant to be viewable on plain old TVs, it would also feature special scenes that break the frame, allowing viewers equipped with virtual reality (VR) headsets to look around and explore the inside of a spaceship or immerse themselves in an alien firefight. Its a very interesting blend, said Betuel. The otherworldiness of it lends itself to VR.

Sounds like the alternative angles DVD feature.  Could be good for the success of the series which I'm looking forward to


 




 Pretty open to ideas beyond what I mentioned in the OP. I think that it is half the fun for the people creating stuff to have a lot of freedom.    Steak_59 has already done something cool but if you are rustling anything up we can use it at some point if not at the same time.  Thanks for your interest. 




 Thanks. That snoo is awesome and looks great.  I've dropped it in the sidebar because I wanted to use it immediately.  Later on it should take its proper position in the header and I'll drop a credit to you too when I figure out the redesign.  For the header, I think some kind of crowd/action photo could look good.

Inertia-Labs (formerly known as Team Rhino until Season 4.0) is one of BattleBots' most well-known teams. It is headed by Alexander Rose and Reason Bradley. The team won many battles at Robot Wars and BattleBots, and continued to fight long after BattleBots ended, mainly in the antweight category.

 Thanks for posting. Someone else posted it a minute after you.  However, that link is internationally accessible and not restricted by country. So   we will run with that one and remove this one.   




 /r/battlebots 

A subreddit about robot combat and competitive robotics.  We are trying to get away from the TV brand and make our subreddit more about reddit and reddit's community.    So some kind of snoo would be great or even a whole design for our header.


Something that works on a dark background is probably a good idea.  Also it would be nice to have a snoo's as a user flairs.    

Any suggestions or help appreciated. 

   




 All those other subreddits are independent of this one.  They can offer different content and a different pace. They are all worth subscribing to and contributing to.    (more related subreddit are listed in the sidebar )

I can only speak for what this subreddit is trying to do and offer.  There is a great community here thanks to the momentum of the TV show but the common interest is way beyond a tv show and that is what I have always defined this community around.

 




 Hopefully things like the [current sticky post advertising a "fantasy league"  will attract interest and happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3d7nci/would_anybody_be_interested_in_a_rbattlebots/
) .

People are still building bots and may share their local experiences in combat or engineering.

There is also the possibility of a reddit community funded bot but not heard from them for a while.

Review old stuff and general discussions.

Other television shows such as BBC Airheads might be of interest as it sounds like it is going to be of a similar flavour to robot wars.

Hopefully enough to keep all the robot combat subs ticking over.  It may be a little quieter though.

Ideas for this subreddit are most welcome especially people willing to implement them. 




 /r/battlebots is for fans of robot combat and all forms of competitive robotics.  It isn't tied to the television show.  People are already welcome to post whatever they want here whether it is robotwars, drone racing of conceptual ideas/art.  

Any suggestions to help make that more obvious are welcome.  I think we will drop the header image soon and more of the branding that ties to the show once it is over (or even sooner if anyone can help make some nice graphics).  




 Gore/NSFW warnings would be good  




 They haven't sold the show abroad yet.  Maybe it is too American or maybe the deal with ABC gives them exclusivity for a bit.. 




 It has been downvoted because it is a repost.  Thanks for posting though. 




 I've removed this link for the same reason I remove "full episode links" -   A playlist doesn't support a specific discussion about robot combat and is just link dumping.  I'm still trying to work out specific and consistent rules.  So please bear with me and try and understand . 

Feel free to add the youtube playlist to [the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/wiki/).  I will add it to the sidebar along with the other official links.  


 




 Internationally accessible https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHjSr1qz3IA 
 




 check the info on /r/shadowban 




 Added a tab.   




 Thanks for posting.  However, full episodes posted as direct links are not ok because they are unreliable  and don't support a discussion.  You can post them in the comments though .   Edited clips supporting a specific discussion are fine as links.  So I have removed your post for now.   




 Then don't bother including them because no one actually cares about them and they do not come to /r/battlebots read about them.  I'm not sure what you are trying to achieve here. 




 Stop dropping big spoilers and then trolling or ignoring people complaining  . It isn't clever or welcome and this is at least the 2nd time you have done this.   People have asked you nicely.  Each time you have not edited your post or used the spoiler markup in the sidebar.  This shouldn't require moderator intervention.    




  I was pretty annoyed when the Mod deleted my post and wouldn't explain what I should fix but I'm glad I'm getting some positive feedback

 [The problem with your previous essay was highlighted as a flair and a comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3d2kqw/do_you_want_a_season_2_of_battlebots_we_need_to/ct19ayf).  I even quoted the specific sentence that I was not happy with and matched it up to reddit's rules on vote manipulation.  

It was sufficient explanation because  in this revision you say, ... "I apparently can't ask you to upvote..." This is an indication that you are  starting to understand basic reddit rules !  I'm not sure why you feel entitled to any extra attention nor the need to dedicate your revision to me.  

 




   Most people think it is a good post.  However, a descriptive title might help avoid surprising people . 

Putting the spoiler tag on it seems to damage it as people might think it is more than what it is and avoid it.   How to handle spoilers and people complaining about spoilers is something this sub needs to think about a bit more.  Maybe if there is a 2nd season there will be a firm policy. 




  I do like that the show has been on the front page of reddit a couple times now but maybe we should agree and try as a subreddit to get proper links voted up on those subs vs illegitimate links.

Reddit rules : **"Don't ask for votes or engage in vote manipulation."**

Also do not encourage negative attention on the people who contribute to this subreddit.  

Use /r/battlebotsmeta if you want to address moderation issues in this subreddit  such as what posts should be removed or changed. 




 Arguably it isn't really a spoiler.  It is just a teaser and has been put out there by Battlebots.  It is the same as any other episode preview or trailer.  This sub discusses public information around battlebots.  The real spoilers that we would probably remove rather than flair is inside information about the results of matches.  Another way to handle this is to just get rid of the spoiler flair altogether because it seems to imply that certain content is off limit when in fact it is on-topic.    I'd rather just encourage descriptive title such as "Episode 5 sneak peek" and even just use the flairs to add this information..


Just to note, we have started to sticky ["spoiler-free" discussion threads for episodes](http://redd.it/3cewrv
) for those that want to avoid teasers and previews.  We also flair things as "robot combat", "bot building" and "general robotics" where the topic isn't battlebots the tv  show.  These are also good for people that want to avoid teasers and previews.  
 




 We've made the spoiler tag a bit more substantial. Hope that helps.   




 To address your specific issue, I have changed the existing "spoiler" flair  to block thumbnails as well as label posts.  


nsfw is a bit of a hack and hides too much content from casual users and people don't necessarily want to enable NSFW  on their reddit accounts to view battlebots tv gossip.  Only in very small tight knit communities would it work nicely.

I've removed your post because I don't want people marking stuff nsfw based on your suggestion.
 




 They are using a create-online and sell generic website widget for hats and clothing.

The fact that they have not sold the licensing rights to a proper merchandising company makes me think it is unlikely we are going to see anything quality in the near future.  Next season maybe

More discussion on this

https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3cfpke/battlebotscom_now_selling_merch/ 




 /u/Jamesterjim -  the top mod of /r/robotwars told me he has the original hyponodisc in his garage.  (don't try and figure out who he is or post personal information. I'm just username mentioning him here in case he wants to say hi but he is pretty inactive on that account.)  You are right that it was the most iconic robotwars bot.  It was definitely a collectors item if the original team did not hang onto it. 









 Interesting to see the branding develop.  They dropped the "RE" bit completely.  RE was an HTC product line.

Still there on the older website logo which was around when this subreddit was made http://www.htcvr.com/ 




 Sure support the official youtube channel.  Maybe we will put that channel in the sidebar along with hulu and abc go. 

However, ABC need to make their clips available internationally and not restricted by country.  There may be licensing reason not to do that ..e.g they want to sell the show in other countries.  However,  if it remains as it is , then the fan-made edits become the go-to option for discussion forums and finding them becomes a main topic for discussion.  I think the hype and interest we have on reddit encourages more people to watch the show live and so it isn't doing harm.   

 









 /r/robotcombatart  (link) 




 So you know, that link shortener will hit the spam filter and it will be up to mods to approve it.  So there may be delay  




 You still got 3000 subscribers here and your /r/Battlebots post seem to get in and ahead of others.  So you have a fanbase and following on reddit no matter what happens on youtube.

If you don't personally want to continue, can I suggest you open up this sub in some way.  
 




 "This channel has no videos."

The problem with them closing down all the youtube links is that people are going to be trying harder to find them as it is no long as so easy.  Hence this sub may unfortunately turn into a hive of piracy and not be about all the other cool stuff we talk about.    




 Some of the short clips of just the battles posted to this sub are still there and working  




 check the info on /r/ShadowBan as your user account has problems 




 I don't normally remove posts based on content.  Lack of content is the problem here! 




 Thanks.  That Sounds great .   /u/MikeNCR leads all the AMA scheduling. So I hope he will be able to confirm with you the spot.  




  Nothing for females, yay. 

PR disaster for them.  They  are using udella.com which is a create online and sell .  So they deliberately chose not to have any female sizes, models or products . It would have just been a click  to make it happen.

  Actually, I'd MUCH rather have shirts from the builder teams representing my favourite bots and have some of the profit go to them for repairs and future designs.

This should happen.  They can promote them on /r/battlebots provided they stick around and talk to people.

 Some really bad mockups.  Looks like one of those  generic  T-shirt printing companies that supply a widget for your website when you supply them a logo.  

I think they  could do really well on merchandise and licensing .  Toys, clothing etc.   So disappointed to see them promote their brand in such an amateur way. 




 Hey kidkaracho thanks for posting. I've removed this post as I don't want full episodes posted as direct link posts at the moment . Clips and edited footage that promotes a discussion is fine. Full episode links are tolerated in the comments.

This policy is due to the reliability of links, the need to promote discussion and community wishes.  Sorry, I haven't formulated explicit sidebar rules on this. 




 This thread is a good slow burner.  Thanks for making it. I've stickied  it and hopefully it will keep going for a bit.  

Also don't forget we host "Ask a builder Anything | AMA" threads - normally on wednesdays.  See sidebar.

This week we have Will Bales - "Hypershock"  




 check the info on /r/shadowban 




 Already had "fights only" posted .  Thanks anyway 




 If you want, why not create a  thread for pre-episode [spoiler free] discussion of the fights and predictions .  I'm sure people will respect it and you can make your own rules in the OP for the discussion.  In fact, if you or someone wants to organise and police it properly, I can give them some moderator permissions and it can be a sticky at some point.

As you say, the show is putting the information out there and things like  promos are always going to be dissected in the comments.  I think it is easy to avoid direct discussion of the show and still find plenty of stuff here.  

The only stuff I would moderate against is things like the results of matches being revealed by people who have been to the filming.

Now what annoyed me most recently was Terminator Genysis -  every big plot twist was revealed in its [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNU_jrPxs-0) 




 In the UK it was called  Scrapheap Challenge.  It was presented by Robert Llewellyn (Kryten of Red Dwarf - Same show that the robotwars presenter Craig Charles is famed for.)  It would be neat if they copresented on a robotwars revival.
  




 Post this to /r/BattleBots

 /r/battlebotsmeta 




 It is a waste when people vote down stuff to 13 % (i.e. hidden on default settings) when, in fact, the thread features some thoughtful replies , interesting points and original discussion.  This isn't about the quality or accuracy of the OP but maybe some casuals have similar thoughts .    




 Stickied for an hour for the discussion.  

 









 Thanks that is a great example of how to do it right.    I think I may discard the bot and try and find a mod to handle it.   




 The disaster and community involvement in the design is part of the fun.  I guess some dogecoin fans just want to see the branding 




 I think you are right.  I think people on reddit just want more technical and tactical filler and not just what we are getting now.

I think browsing /r/battlebots while watching the show is the perfect compromise.

 














 Flaired as a possible spoiler.  

 




 You know they actually do stuff like this and they millions of views.  Granted, it is "best of" or "top auditions"  rather than episodes.  However, the idea remains that people don't give a shit about the filler especially when viewing for a 2nd time. 




 
The critisim of filler was a big topic here : ["Lets cut to the chase: There was 10ish minutes of watchable TV in the first episode."](
http://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3at8pz/lets_cut_to_the_chase_there_was_10ish_minutes_of/)

Below is what battlebots executive produce said to a subscriber of /r/battlebots regarding fillers

[It is the /r/battlebots top post of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3ax944/contacted_battlebots_was_not_disappointed/)


 
 HI Sepheroth998 - This is Greg the co-founder of BB and EP of the show. Ive been browsing this Subreddit (and all the comments elsewhere on social media. Ive also forwarded the link to the other EPswere listening.
 
 There are many answers to the many comments on the thread, but the bottom line is this:
 Were on ABC. 
 
 The show many hardcore fans seem to want would never be on ABC. It would more likely be on something like Discovery Scienceand a small cable network would never have the budget to produce the show we want. Because were on ABC we cant make a predominantly science / tech / engineering focused show. We would lose a huge chunk of the audience and never get a season 2. 
 
 We have to appeal to a wider range of people, hence the sports casters, tale of the tape, background packages, etc. Wall-2-wall robot fighting and would fatigue a majority of the audience and the show would fail. So we need to walk the line between fights and filler. 
 
 Do we have too much filler? I definitely think so. Im actually agreeing with many of the comments Im seeing. But Im a tech/robot geek (probably like most of the Reddit posters). And we cant make the show just for people like us, we need to go broader. In the end its all about balance.
 
 That said, more tech and real robot analysis is coming. Bobak Ferdowsi is a real robot engineer and he will be doing breakdowns of many of the robots in future episodes. And were learningmore importantly our production partner Whalerock is learning, and season 2 will most likely incorporate many of the suggestions were reading from fans, and the balance will be a better mix of fights and relevant talk. 
 
 So please stick with us and keep the faith. At worst use the fast forward button on your DVR : ) (or better yet just Mute and get a snack)
 
 And we did try and get Grant on the showjust didnt work out this time around.
 
 Email me anytime
 Greg

 I would approve it if it wasn't just the homepage.

 /r/battlebots or are you talking about the removal of filler.  because that is a great idea 




 The battlebots executive producer agrees there is too much filler  

 The show many hardcore fans seem to want would never be on ABC. It would more likely be on something like Discovery Scienceand a small cable network would never have the budget to produce the show we want. Because were on ABC we cant make a predominantly science / tech / engineering focused show. We would lose a huge chunk of the audience and never get a season 2.

Anyway, please subscribe to **/r/Battlebots** .    We have an awesome and lively community during screenings


 




 A lot of subreddits have twitter feeds pumping out links from the new queue.  

I made one for /r/Battlebots .
https://twitter.com/RBattlebots


I want it to grab some of the audience who follow  #battlebots 




However, it was quickly banned from appearing in search results.

That seems fair because it was just spamming links.  

So I want to know how did other subreddits get their spamming twitter accounts into good standing with Twitter.  I don't know much about twitter.  

Should I be asking my reddit subscribers to interact with it?

Should I give the new account some time to overcome age limitations ?

Should I stop posting links and just post the titles ?

Is my account banned requiring a new account?


So the questions are mainly about how to use twitter to spam reddit links .   I think there are some general lessons and warnings here for setting up a twitter feed .  Any help apprecaited.

 I thought something like this was a great idea.  It is very reddit too! It gets harder when I think of how much merchandise and stuff is floating around for stuff like RW and not sure of the quality.  It might be a more exclusive thing for the collectors. 




 Make it more than just an advert.  Tell us more about what you plan to spend the money on and how you may scale up or down depending on what you raise.  Remember there are technical minded people here who can evaluate your plans and there may other  help or interest other than just cash. 









 " Use Voat Instead " 




 **The wiki**   

I think the [/r/Battlebots wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/wiki/index)  could be a useful place to promote other websites, robot combat organisations and guides etc

https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/wiki/index


Use it in whatever way you want.   Add pages and improve the formatting if it helps.   Your account needs to have had a small amount of activity in this subreddit to edit it.  If someone wants to put a lot of work into it and curate it, I'll throw them some mod powers to help them manage it.    Meanwhile, I want to try and make sure that our sidebar is promoting community content. 

----------------
**Other stuff**

*User Flairs:*  

User flairs are now editable text and can be whatever you want for fun.   

People can get a "Verified Roboteer" flair by choosing a flair with the name of their bot or team experience and then participating in the [thread](http://redd.it/39s4hy).  Again, it is just for fun and to identify who is actually a builder of a particular robot .  "Verified Roboteers "  need to remember not to edit the text of your flair or else you will lose your verification status. 


*Posting:*

I just wanted to remind people that we are interested in everything around competitive robots and not just Battlebots the television show.  So feel free to share some crazy Ideas, concept art and stuff from other robotic events and tv shows.     
 
/r/battlebotsmeta  exists for ideas, feedback and whatever .   




 Looks like you started this thread to preach an ideology 




 Outside the US, there are no options.  Our sidebar has some official US links.  Full episodes are easy to find on youtube. So it doesn't look like they are clamping down on it.  I'd say that it is in their interests to get people widely interested in the brand again in the 1st season.

Only Mods can add this type of flair in the flair setting menu 

https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/about/flair/

Mods need to add  "VER" as the CSS class and then save. 

This adds the text "Verified Roboteer" and the yellow background.


---------------
Possible discussion: 

Is the styling right? 

Who gets flairs? 

Do we need any other types of flair?



I don't want it to be untidy and I want people to feel equal unless they have some genuinely useful experience/achievement that a flair may help advertise.  I can do some fancy hovering or animation but then I thought it is better to show the information.


It might be cool to have a selection of grey flairs that users can choose from for fun.  But I'm not bothered to do that work at the moment..

------------------
Edit: I don't think the old flair templates were set up quite right.  I cleared all the flair templates.  It wasn't a thought out decision, so sorry to whoever took the time to do that and if it was that way for good reason that I did not understand.

Anyway....

It is now user editable text rather than a limited range of flairs.  

Those who change their text to their own bot can then get verified by mods.  

The old system was too dull and people were choosing flairs like "Robot Wars".  I think it is more fun to let people choose their own text in flairs.   

 




 no need.  Just saying so people know if comments or the post itself  disappear.  I already picked this out of the spam bin once .The best thing is not to use the shorteners and revert to long links.   




 Hey thanks for this.  Just to warn you those links shorteners like goo.gl and others get filtered by reddit . So if you edit the OP or someone quotes them, mods will have to approve them manually. 




 wrong sub! you want /r/battlebots 
 









 Pretty much everyone is saying that.  I hope they see the interest and make a companion show for any subsequent series.   I could also imagine a good youtuber remixing the actual fights with their own analysis and making a better show. 









 I agree. I changed it yesterday in an effort to make some of the main listing pages easier to read but over looked the main text.    Will have a look 




 Glad you found the episode discussio thread. removing this 




 wrong sub. 




 I'm surprised there hasn't been more fan art and casual discussion of concepts. Maybe this is an interest that will grow more when the show is off air and there is less real stuff to occupt people.  I'm not sure how it would work on a message board but sort of see how it works on reddit. Maybe you can try testing interest sometime. 




 Hey /r/television, given the popularity of some [recent posts in here](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/2v0gz8/battlebots_coming_back_to_air_on_abc_for_the/), I think there is a lot of interest in the current series of Battlebots.  I started this post so that we can talk about the latest episode of battlebots here.  I also wanted to highlight the televisions oriented discussion happening in /r/Battlebots right now.

 The mods help enable the community.  Part of this means that the door is left open for people willing to step up and make things happen.  Are you offering to do something specific and useful ?  What is your plan for "some energetic positive moderation"?   The other question is, does your plan actually require moderator powers or mod support.  

All the mods so far were added by me for a reason  and they have done a lot of good for the subreddit both in hard work, giving it credibility and offering experience.  No one is holding this subreddit back and we are all keen to make as many ideas and activities happen.   We also need "positive community" as opposed to an "entitled community" .   




 Big Spoilers

For me spoilers are things like who wins and loses matches . If I see such information in the title of a post before a TV show I will remove it and maybe ask the user to repost it with a better title. If I see a title of a post warning of spoilers inside, I may tolerate it depending if the information is important and more than just spoiling the tv show for others.


Mild Spoilers 

Mild spoilers are things like photos of bots, tv adverts and who is participating. If the title of a post reflects the content, then there is nothing for moderators to do. If a post title invites people to look at photos, adverts or match line-ups, then a user can to decide for themselves if they want to look at it. They don't need any extra warnings as it is obvious that it is a mild spoiler of sorts.
If people are so adverse to mild spoilers and incapable of reading titles, then they should not be browsing a subreddit about battlebots.

 




 I usually add moderators on the basis that they offer to do something useful and specific

This sub is a good place to present ideas.


Other moderators can add new moderators on a similar basis.   




 Lets make these happen and promote them when they happen.

/r/IAMA allow people to post links to ama events happening in different subreddits.

/r/technology  allow self posts and are often quite tolerant especially if asked nicely.

Other robotic subs?  

 




 These have been well done and encouraged some good interactions. 

However, I think they can be technically improved by assigning CSS classes. within the flair menu.  With the right styling  "verified roboteers" or teams can have colored flairs or icons.  

I can do the CSS for this but if we want to have some icons and graphics, then some help and ideas.   

I could add a  flair specific mod in the same way other subreddits do ?


----

There is also an argument to keep the flairs similar and dull as this encourages an atmosphere where there are no "power users" .   

 




 At the moment we allow anything related to competitive robotics.

We aren't removing anything and accept all behavior.  I don't think a tv show is going to bring out the worst in people but who knows.

 I think the community is really good and mature.  The downvotes will sort out the really bad trolls. 

If anything is removed (comment or link), we inform the user unless it is obvious and random spam.   

Some of those repetitive questions such as where to find episodes can be removed if we catch them early and can redirect to an older thread.   




 This is a widget for promoting threads which may be old or are link threads that we cannot sticky .  Also for making announcements.


 [This was the example](http://i.imgur.com/4PNxBcK.jpg).

If it is useful , we could make the header area bigger to accommodate multiple announcements


----


Moderators simply need to edit the sidebar text to change these

https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/about/edit/ 

Add this to the **top** of the sidebar:

    * [](#notice)[Thing 1](link-to-thing-one)
    * [](#important)[Thing 2](link-to-thing-two)


----------


The css code for this change
    
    .side .titlebox .md ul:first-of-type li a[href="#notice"] + a:before {
        content:"NOTICE";
        background-color:#A0C55F
    }
     
    .side .titlebox .md ul:first-of-type li a[href="#important"] + a:before {
        content:"IMPORTANT";
        background-color:#f44336
    }
    
    .side .titlebox .md ul:first-of-type li a[href="#highlight"] + a:before {
        content:"DON'T MISS";
        background-color:#f44336
    } 
    
    
    .side .titlebox .md ul:first-of-type li a[href="#discuss"] + a:before {
        content:"DISCUSS";
        background-color:#f44336
    }

 We don't promote full episode links in any official capacity . There are a lot of people who cannot access the show as it is only broadcast in america and there is literally no other way to access it. Hence, we tolerate it. The sub also tolerates other long clips of the show because people want to talk about them.
You are right that it can be a problem as piracy can strangle a show. So this policy may change if the sub grows very large, if we get targeted by spammers, if the community demand the mods take action (as you are now), if battlebots talks to us and explain that it is actually a problem or I start to see DMCA takedown requests in /r/chillingeffects .
Right now, we are trying to grow the community and see what they want. So no heavy moderation or rules just yet but rather encouraging people to talk and share stuff. This and other possible rules is definitely something that we should keep talking about though.
Meanwhile, feel free to point out the problem to the people sharing links either directly or by addressing the community in a self post.

--------------

Our sidebar now caries links to official episodes (US only) .  This is to show that we do primarily support people using the official methods to access the show.
