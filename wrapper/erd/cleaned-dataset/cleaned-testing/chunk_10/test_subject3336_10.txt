 loved the hyperloop reference :D 
 




 if you can watch in 360p or some lower quality to minimize the cpu spike. 









 post the output for this - " lspci |grep -i VGA "   




 ah yes! H2O 




 its morbidly beautiful! Go till the end!   




 i have too :D XD  
 




 oleophobic - this is for anti-oils

Edit - look below  




 you have the right settings for YouTube.   
Have you tried it in safe mode?  
Also check out /u/caspy7 comment.   




 i finished it! :D  
Some stages are real hard though :/  
Really tests your brain/logic   




 Limbo 




 A flashing system will come later. :)  




 suit yourself

 not sure if its just me but Smooth Scroll+APZ enabled on nightly causes a lot blur. Kind of disorienting if you scroll fast enough.   




 Open hardware at the end slide. That is truly something.   




 its already present [b2gdroid](https://people.mozilla.org/~fdesre/b2gdroid/)  

I just wish it improves much faster and takes off well!  
Some unknown good vibe about this one!   




 Did you try out [Safe Mode](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-using-safe-mode) and see if the problems resolved?  

If not, [Refresh Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings) or Create a [New Profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles)(back up data)

 i meant the general policy of limiting rooting by manufacturers; not some app/developer.  




 Only limited to India.   
Indian users should demand rooting as a legal modification of one's device.   
Phones in Europe are under warranty even after being rooted.  




 Facebook asks me to go install flash... I went and installed an addon to get html5 videos, everything is good! :)  




 If u really need flash, uninstall via the Uninstaller provided at the Adobe site and then install a fresh version.  
See if the problems still exist. 

Youtube- whats enabled on youtube.com/html5 ?

What OS and FF version? 




 check this add-on - HTML5 Video Everywhere!  
Works good!  

EDIT- doesn't work in theater/pop-up mode. have to open video in new tab 




 apparently the "HTML5 Video Everywhere!" add-on does the job very well

EDIT- doesn't work in theater/pop-up mode. have to open video in new tab 




 Maybe it's a slow rollout 




 Yup!  




 have no flash installed on linux. Still serves me flash. 




 probably have a policy not to let things that break their offering, so as to be in control of their download store. 

also the nova prime version can also be side-loaded; there will be a trade off somewhere in this kind of approach   




 as per nova; it could be a play-store kinda stuff where they have control.  

As an open app you see the potential is unlimited   




 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/43.0.2357.132 Safari/537.36   
 
Youll may have to modify this for your OS; or check UA from chrome; copy-paste ;)   




 Yes! but you need to be on the latest chrome 43 user-agent.  
The player has minor defects though   




 More transition effects in the app drawer or homescreen switches.  
More app based integration like aviate.  
my color screen like themes.  
^ all of this added/removed by the users wishes(so he/she can keep it light or as feature rich as possible).  

Im not Saying Nova devs should'nt be rewards for their work. They have every right to put a price on their app after all the hard-work that goes into it.  

But the possibility of the what nova can do can be really expanded once you have a user/dev/contributor system in place.  

Also people will pay for stuff if they feel that it improves the overall experience on android.  If an opportunity arrives that they can invest on it/choose the set best set of features for the next version; many will definitely contribute to the development.  


 




 True, but one with free cost and run by donation/user input will be nice; i've linked the example of krita and its a solid mode of development - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/krita/krita-free-paint-app-lets-make-it-faster-than-phot 




 they do play html5 on chrome :/ 

its really really annoying!   




  plugin API

ah yeah thats the right word, my bad.  

But going completely open and having a development model like [Krita](https://krita.org/)([kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/krita/krita-free-paint-app-lets-make-it-faster-than-phot) based for funding for new features+open-source) is  truly spectacular. 




 Yes i do know its free, but there are better features on the paid version.  
If we have an open system, people have access to all of this and if they really like it you could donate to fund development.  

Sadly google rewards isnt everywhere. 




 yup an open-source alternative :) 




 i've personally noticed that lot of people want to customize but don't really do anything because they look up their favorite launcher has a limited custom set of awesome features; and also for lots of android user - the cost is a big hindrance($ - local currency conversion)  

So most of them settle for the UI that comes with the phone or install a free version of the launcher with limited set of feature.  

When you have an open environment, users/devs could write an unlimited amount tiny plugins that people can download for features they'd like to have in a launcher.   
The app can also accept donations from users so that good development happens.  

I really like Nova and i hope they continue to be the game changer! :)
 




 i didnt mean for them to cease development; i just wish it'll bring in more addition from people who could write plugins for new UI experiences.  
Additionally it can be free of cost for people to find it hard to pay the price.  

Onside note - Yes the do deserve to keep it on sale! They're are doing a great job! :D  

 




 we need an open-source alternative to nova.  
hell nova should do this!  

Edit - i guess i didnt explain my thoughts in the best way possible; probably the sub threads will help bring it to light 




 THIS THIS AND ONLY THIS! 




 Install    Use gnome-tweak-tool to change the hdpi settings,   

Also have the graphics driver installed.   
If it's a Optimus technology based graphics technology, install bumblebee. Fedora has an article on bumblebee and steps for it.  
Else grab the driver for nvidia from rpm fusion.  




 Yeah that's why I heard. I bought limbo on sale before. 
I loved the game even though it was short and a single time  




 Never go full retard 




 nope :(  
i think ill get that  




 Monument Valley and Wolfram Alpha.  
one time thing wont play/use constantly so waiting for a discount.   




 i hate that 'a' icon. it looks out of place.  




 i just want to say this.  

Don't give up on the b2gdroid platform.  
it has a HUGE HUGE potential im totally unaware of but i know it exists.  
Yes, its not bug-free but please continue to develop and erase all the issues.   
I was instally in awe of the UI on b2gdroid; and its very very good on usability and friendliness.   
Keep developing!  

Once its ready launch it on the playstore as an homescreen alternative and take-off from there!  

One Major issue- battery drain. Please fix that. And if rolling nightly releases are available things will be much better for tester's.   




 The b2gdroid implementation was really really good.  
Ofcourse there are bugs everywhere. But its a good take off for FirefoxOS on android devices.  
I really hope they continue to develop on it.   




 Oh damn, Phoronix went a retweeting spree 




 What do you have enabled on www.youtube.com/html5?  




 :D 




 this is genius! O_O  




 it depends on the site. There nothing you can do if they don't serve html5 video content.  
If you need to install flash, download the latest and keep it constantly updated.   




 then it could be mostly your add-ons. Check it out in Safe-mode and see if the issue occurs.  
If it still happens and is limited to FF then mostly a bug. 




  what all enabled on youtube.com/html5 ? 




 i've reported about this many times via the app and the site; along with various other issue.  
No response nor action. Just the standard "Thank you for reporting this issue" :( 




 its the mobile site. 
You should switch to or goto https://www.youtube.com/  
Just tell me whats in red on youtube.com/html5 




 do you have a dual gpu system? nvidia+intel? optimus Tech?   




 is yours a dual gpu system? Optimus tech? Intel+Nvidia?   




 if you really need flash use an addon like "youtube html5" that force enables it.  

Mostly the "request html5" should switch you over to html5 and make it a permanent change unless cookies or cache gets cleared after every session(which could cause it revert back)  

Happy YouTubing! :) 




 if im not wrong - YouTube is html5 by default now;  
Mime Type: video/mp4; codecs="avc1.4d401e"  
DASH: yes (134/140)   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLQK9la6Go  
^ this is an indicator of html5 playback  

Why dont you try clearing; cache and cookies related to YouTube and see if has any effect.  
I hope you don't have any add-on that has forced flash to play.  
 




 if everything like i mentioned in the other comment fails  
Get gstreamer1; gstreamer0.10 is End of Life;  
And im not sure how debain works around with this stuff.  
Buy according to fedora you'll have a good, bad and ugly set of gstreamer packages.( Maybe a separate ffmpeg package too).  
Maybe debian has them inbuilt.  

http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/  

Perhaps you could ask around in r/debian for more help.   




 okay do one thing - try using an add-on that forces YouTube to use html5.  
If that works out then right click to see if you're being served mp4 video formats.  
Another option will be to disable flash inside the browser.  
 









 sounds like a true revolution on that page!  




 weird format? could you post a screen shot?  
Also what does youtube.com/html5 tell you?  
Have you tried clearing cache   cookies for youtube?   




 check this out too - http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/download-windows-media-player 




 :) 




 thats quite strange. Do you have chrome, perhaps your could check youtube.com/html5 and see if it helps?  
Also on what Firefox version are you on?   




 http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/codecs-frequently-asked-questions#codecs-frequently-asked-questions=windows-8 




 do you have media player installed?  
Thats the only source other than KB update file through windows update 




 you should also have gstreamer0.10 and gstreamer1 packages installed  




 you should allow access on the android phone after plugging in the device.   
Test with a different port or usb cable 




 Disable Flash? it'll be better i think  

Verify in about:config and if these are set to true:  

media.mediasource.enabled  
media.mediasource.format-reader.mp4  
media.mediasource.mp4.enabled  
media.format-reader.mp4  
media.fragmented-mp4.enabled  
media.fragmented-mp4.exposed  
media.fragmented-mp4.ffmpeg.enabled  
media.fragmented-mp4.gmp.enabled  

Set this to false: media.mediasource.webm.enabled  

Verify @ youtube.com/html5  
webM(under development)  
If somethings are missing from the ones listed here its okay   




 dont enable webM(it still under development) - itll cause playback trouble

goto about:config and set these to true:  

media.mediasource.enabled  
media.mediasource.format-reader.mp4  
media.mediasource.mp4.enabled  
media.format-reader.mp4  
media.fragmented-mp4.enabled  
media.fragmented-mp4.exposed  
media.fragmented-mp4.ffmpeg.enabled  
media.fragmented-mp4.gmp.enabled  

Set this to false: media.mediasource.webm.enabled  

Verify @ youtube.com/html5  
webM(under development)  
If somethings are missing from the ones listed here its okay   




 dont enable webM(it still under development) - itll cause playback trouble 




 well if thats the case you might have to contact the add-on dev.  
If that seems hard then probably filing a bug with the similar format details of bugs listed on the above site might be fine. 




 click on report bug should take you to bugzilla. Mostly the add-on dev get contacted from there 




 i think he meant to report the crash links here 




 better let it be disabled; you'll run into playback issues. Its still under development 




 Hey there!  

Check on these lines in about:config to be set to "true":   
media.mediasource.enabled  
media.mediasource.format-reader.mp4  
media.mediasource.mp4.enabled  
media.format-reader.mp4  
media.fragmented-mp4.enabled  
media.fragmented-mp4.exposed  

Some of the option listed above might not be there in your Firefox so its okay to skip them.  
And a suggestion let webM be disabled. You'll run into a lot of choppy performance issues on YouTube and ruin the experience.  
Also dont think ignore_codecs is necessary. Try without it as well.  

If h264 is still being unrecognized its mostly the codec not being present on the system.   




 and...still getting downvotes. o.o 
Started from the bottom now we here!

 Why isn't Firefox users being served html5 just like the Google Chrome Crowd?  




 people putting up imgur links are the greatest!  




 its meant for linux; it uses chrome's flash and runs it for firefox 




 They could have put a better snapdragon. 




 Maybe for collectors or nostalgia buyers 




 Use the same circle selection took and trace out the shape. Just paint the edges with paintbrush 




 Try something like pipelight or fresh flash player and see if it loads. 


The Linux flash player is so old that at time new content will never load on it  









 Support for new Unicode 8.0 skin tone emoji - https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/39.0/releasenotes/  
And color does work with Firefox on Android; its been implemented for desktop long back - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=889401 




 F11 should do that by default and only show the awesome bar when you mouse over near the top of the screen.  
Maybe one of your add-ons is causing interference? Check in safe mode?

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2729094   




 Yeah i do understand your situation. Perhaps you could create a post and explain your situation. Someone could help you out :) 




 OS? 




 i think it depends on the OS's capability to render colored one's or not.  
On android it does render with color and google's emoji set.  
on my linux machine pure black and white :( 




 what i mentioned here is for personal usage.(i don't want to blamed for some problems on a larger scale later on - hope you understand; and everything can be fixed with a reset/refresh)  
Since these things will become enabled in the proper way once things hit release.  
But if you insist use this addon for mass setup - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cck2wizard/  

Not sure how it works but perhaps the right one for the job.  
Also:  
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Deployment:Deploying_Firefox  

Above stuff include parameters for linux 




 trace out with a path tool and make it a selection-paint brush with a white color  
for the inner circle use the circle selection and paint it out blue.

 Wow! this is neat :D
This should become an easter egg inside firefox release ;) :D 




 update to the latest version of flash provided by adobe.  
Personally; id just let it be disabled for sometime until they finish uncovering everything the Hacker Team did.  

Popular sites will have an html5 alternative; mostly you'll never need to do anything.   




 This is so Awesome :D 




 that video is 360p60 strange O_O 




 i think its high time sites move away from flash. Hopefully people start voicing their opinions over email or social media and that turns to a positive change. 




 whoever even thinks of helping them - Just Do IT! Anything is POSSIBLE! 




 does this happen in safe mode as well?  
If it doesnt then probably some add-on is causing the trouble 




 per element is what ive been looking for a long time. Didn't know it existed  




 i just love how adobe cancelled linux support with "security updates" only xD 




 look at comment below
