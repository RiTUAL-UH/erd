 I don't think it is all that bad, provided you have an absolutely solid grasp of math. You're taking basically three full math courses (four, if you include stats) that they really expect you to take only one of every semester. Each will have long, weekly assignments, multiple tests, probably around the same time, and pretty brutal finals. Add 122 and Thermo on top of that, and you might as well kiss your free time goodbye, unless you really really enjoy math and are exceptionally good at working *quickly* through it. 

Also, Mihai is absolute garbage. I have also heard Steif is not good either.

I would recommend spacing out these difficult math classes over the course of more semesters. Knock out a few required electives instead of trying to get through all the gen eds as fast as you can.  




 Sold 3DS XL to /u/Thromordyn  









 With or without shipping costs? Where do you need it shipped to?  




 I've got an Asus r9 270x, complete with box and everything. Offer.  




 Yes, the locker room, showers, and pool are closed. No towel service either.  




 The new facilities are reported to be ready and open by the time fall semester starts, but we all know that there are most likely going to be delays. In the meantime, there is Skibo gym, which has a modest collection of weights. 

The smaller gym in the CUC is still open on and off during the renovations, you will just need to check since the closings aren't scheduled. Though this gym is mainly equipment and dumbbells, no bench press benches or squat racks, so if you want to do heavy lifting you will want to go to Skibo anyways. 



 




 Don't forget to get the Material Design skin! 




 The marimba sounding notes at the beginning are sharp and sound very dissonant match up with the piano. 

At the part beginning at 1:27, the piano just sounds out of tune. Did you record it using a real piano?  




 Sold 3DS XL to /u/Thromordyn

 




 In competitive smash it's more used for precisely inputting aerial attacks. It's very important in that aspect.  




 No, they run on their own Nintendo charger 




 They are both in perfect condition. 




 SOLD!

Hi everyone!

I have a 3DS XL in Blue/Black for sale. It's in great condition, didn't get it all that long ago. The only damage is two very small chips of paint right under the front cameras, barely noticeable. Everything else is perfect condition. It's still under GameStop warranty (they'll replace any damage no questions asked) until October of this year. I'll include receipt so you can redeem if necessary. 

Will come fully reformatted and ready for a new user/system transfer. Will not include a charger. You can grab a USB Charger from Amazon for about $5. Running version 9.5.0-22U

Selling because I got a New 3DS XL. 

Thanks for looking!

 I got someone for $100 right now so I'll let you know if that doesn't work out. 

Honestly $100 is already a pretty good price so I wouldn't go lower than that. I could sell it on eBay for more but that's kind of a hassle with Paypal fees and what-not.  




 I have the receipt from when he bought it, and that matches the information that he gave me/location that he sent it from. That's what I based it on. I would be shocked if there was another owner before me. 

Again, this device is under GameStop warranty for another 8 months. If ANYTHING goes wrong, you can bring it to GameStop and they will replace it for you no questions asked. I will give you the receipt so you can redeem this if needed. The receipt has the serial number which matches that of the device.  




 Upon closer inspection it looks like there are tiny chips above the two cameras on the front face. It doesn't look bad (I honestly didn't notice anything wrong when I first got it until I inspected it just now). Nothing else is wrong with it. 

In truth, I am the second owner. I bought it in a bundle with a few games only a few weeks ago in the intention of selling the console after getting the New 3DS XL.

 Looks like shipping is gonna be way too much for what it's worth. Sorry about that :( 




 Hmm obviously shipping would have to be higher but I can look into it. Whereabouts in Canada?  




 What exactly would you like to know?  




 9.5.0-22U

 It's probably the quality studio lighting he has going on.  




 I was also kind of hesitant on the MM version but I definitely wanted a New 3DS XL. I heard there was going to be a limited supply of both (obviously much less MM editions) so I went down to Target right before opening to try my luck and get at least one system. 

I managed to get a system and my god it is GORGEOUS in person. Pictures really don't do it justice. The gold is dark and understated, and while I usually hate glossy finishes this one looks so damn sophisticated, like the decals are infused with the system. I feel like a matte finish would have made it look sprayed or stenciled on. 

If you have even the slightest inkling for keeping it I would highly recommend it.  




 Got one at the Waterfront Target. They only had three and all were gone right away.  




 Got an InStock alert. I just ordered one! 

*Edit: looks like it shows up on desktop but not on mobile.  









 Target at Waterfront, Pittsburgh, PA. only had three units. I was able to pick one up! Didn't even wait in line (it's in the single digits in my area so I don't think people wanted to wait outside). No Majora's Mask versions left. 

They didn't have any of the new 3DS XLs in the case, though they probably didn't put them out by the time I got there. Worth a shot if you're still looking.  




 That's not true. The 770s fit right in-between the urban slims and the 484.  




 Confirmed 




 Seriously, I want the MM 3DS but I'd be perfectly happy with $50 off the regular system. Best Buy isn't obligated to give you anything, be happy they gave you $50.  




 PM'd 




 I host a smash party/tournament at my place every few weeks for my close friends. Usually I just order pizza but I was inspired by [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/v9PVLeI.jpg) to make my own smash-themed snacks. What are some good Smash Bros. themed snacks that you guys can come up with? 

Some of my ideas:

* Falcon PUNCH
* Jiggly cream puffs
* Smash ball pizza 

Thank you! 




 Yes. I just reflash the kernel after each update. 




 I completely agree with you. It will be acceptable to some, and unacceptable to others. It doesn't offend me, and has never offended me. It's just something that I personally wouldn't do if I didn't have to wear glasses, given my (admittedly pretty strong) personal moral values. 

As I have said from the beginning, these are my opinions that I offer as someone who does actually have to wear glasses. I'm not trying to convince you or anyone else to do either way; these are just my thoughts on the matter. Make of them what you will.  




 Yeah, it's definitely an extreme case that isn't really the best example. I'm just saying that some people might extrapolate to that. Granted, people actually do some really dumb stuff to try to look cool sometimes. I have heard of people breaking their own arms in middle school to get a cast to look cool. 

I posted a follow up to my comment that I think really explains my reservation against wearing glasses purely for fashion. Please give that a read and tell me what you think. 




 Okay here are some follow up thoughts. 

The whole point of MFA, in my opinion, is getting clothes that compliment your body shape, style, and personality. We do this because everyone has to wear clothes, and how you look is a big part of how other people perceive you and your personality. To me, the most important part of clothing is being true to yourself and your personality, and not trying to trick people into thinking you are something you aren't. It's like wearing biker gear to try to get a girl who likes bikers to like you. It might work, but then you aren't being true to who you are. And when people find out that you are, in a sense, lying about who you are, they tend to get a little angry. 

Sure, glasses might compliment your facial shape, and make you look smarter and more appealing to other people, but it's not necessary for you to wear. As such, it might seem like you are being deceitful and tricking people into thinking you are something you aren't. If you are really smart and nerdy, people will know it without you having to wear nerdy glasses to show that, and you wouldn't have to wear glasses to prove that to people. I wear glasses because I have to wear them, so I might as well pick a pair that both looks good and conveys the style and personality that I am; not to try to be something I'm not. 

I will admit, it is a definite gray area. It will offend some people and won't offend others. I definitely think about fashion fairly differently than most people on this sub I think, so my word might not be the best to listen to. 




 I think it's akin to wearing a cast if your arm isn't broken to look tough, putting an athletic bandage on to make it look like you work out, or talking in an accent to make you appear more worldly. Remember when Bluetooth headsets were a thing? Sure they may have served a purpose, but wearing one when you weren't taking a call (ie. when they weren't necessary) was pretty douchey. In my opinion, the only saving grace is that no one will know. But to those who are slightly knowledgeable about glasses it's pretty easy to tell whether lenses are prescription or not just by looking. 

The fact that you want to wear them to look "smarter" or more like a nerd worries me. I feel like it's kind of playing into a stereotype more than anything. Would you go so far as getting a surgery to look more Asian since Asians are stereotypically perceived as smarter? But then again, it's like dressing with well fitting clothes to make you appear thinner or more athletic than you are, so that may be a moot point. 

I think if you want to go for it, go for it. I've met a few people with fake glasses, and I haven't really held reservations against them once I found out they were fake. 

Full disclosure, though: my vision is bad enough that I need to wear glasses to drive or read the board at school, but I can function completely fine without them. Before I joined MFA, I carried around a pair to use at school, but once I got a pair that were relatively stylish and actually complimented my facial shape, I started wearing them all the time. For me, it was a combination of it both looking nice and being more convenient if it forgot to take them with me somewhere. I guess you could say I am wearing them to look better, but I also get actual utility from having better vision. But then again you might be getting more utility from looking better too. And some people definitely do look much better with the right glasses... 

... Now I really don't know what to think. 

Sorry I can't give you a more definitive answer, but there are my thoughts on the matter for you to consider. 




 ElementalX is working on my Nexus 5 running CM12 nightlies.  




 Invite up: [GLJQ-CVCE-XYC3-OHNK](https://account.oneplus.net/invite/claim/GLJQ-CVCE-XYC3-OHNK) 




 Yeah, I definitely won't be going for a phone with a screen size larger than 5 inches from now on, unless it has ridiculously small bezels. From now on I will be looking at the dimensions before I buy to make sure it is not too big.  




 This review contains only information about my experience with the Oneplus One coming from a Nexus 5. It will not talk about software, as software is so customizable I don't even consider it a factor in the purchase of an Android phone anymore. 

Right before the ball dropped for New Year's, the dreaded happened: I dropped my beloved Nexus 5 and shattered the screen. Thankfully, everything still worked, but shards of glass were flaking off and were posing a hazard to my clothing. My Nexus 5 had served me faithfully for over a year, and it seemed like the time had come for it to retire for the next latest-and-greatest. 

I had had my eye on the Oneplus One as soon as it had been released, and it was my natural choice for a replacement. I purchased an invite off of eBay (this was before I discovered this subreddit!) and in about a week I had my new Oneplus One. 

Now, less than 14 days after shipment, I have decided to return the One. Here's why. 

GENERAL REVIEW

**Packaging**

* [Yeah, it's really nice](https://forums.oneplus.net/attachments/11-jpg.11235/). The cardboard is some of the heaviest I have seen on electronics packaging. The inclusion of an additional Nano SIM adapter is a really nice, super thoughtful touch. The USB cable is top quality, and the SIM tray ejector comes in an over-the-top [silicone keychain holder](http://www.gsmdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/OnePlus-One-review_026-660x495.jpg). The [charge block](https://forums.oneplus.net/attachments/us_charger-jpg.163435/) came in it's own, separate box, presumably to account for different outlet standards. It looks good and is well build. Very impressed so far, especially for a $350 device. 

**First impressions**

* Wow, this thing is big! I did not expect a 0.5 inch size increase to result in such a drastically bigger phone. My Nexus 5 could [basically fit inside the screen](http://cdn03.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/oneplus-one-vs-nexus-5-aa-25-of-28-710x399.jpg) of the Oneplus One. 

* The build quality is fantastic. The silver metal border isn't a super shiny chrome and brings a pretty good amount of class to the device without being too gaudy. The sandstone back didn't feel as great as it was hyped to be but It does feel nice. It's a nice departure from the deep, all black design of the Nexus 5. I would equate the Oneplus One to a [Lamborghini](http://www.caradvice.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lamborghini-Huracan-2.jpg) and the Nexus 5 to a [stealth bomber](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/US_Air_Force_B-2_Spirit.jpg)

**General Build Complaints**

* The buttons are really flush with the sides of the phone, and don't have very much travel distance when pushed. The volume rocker is small (it could pass as a single button), which makes it hard to find and press which volume button you want in your pocket. 

* The power button is closer to the center of the phone than the top. On the Nexus 5 it is almost right at the top. My thumb does not naturally fall on the button when I am gripping my One normally (it lands a little above), like it does when I hold my Nexus. This is not necessarily a bad thing, since it gives you a slightly more secure grip on the phone since you're not afraid of pressing the button accidentally. However, I don't think this was an issue to begin with. I never had that problem when I used my Nexus 5, and the buttons are flush enough and have such a high actuation force the I wouldn't be afraid of pressing the button even if it were right under my thumb. 

* The SIM card tray is awful. It is plastic, unlike the machined metal of the Nexus 5 or any other flagship phone now for that matter. The SIM does not sit very securely on the tray (it can wiggle around a little), and made me question whether I was inserting it right on first try. Also, the fact that you can actually insert the SIM incorrectly is an absolutely TERRIBLE design oversight. The sheer number of complaints of people inserting their SIMs upside down is just ridiculous. Always assume your customers are absolutely stupid and make it impossible for them to mess up anything. 

* The raised glass on the front makes me never want to place my phone face-down. Ever. 

**Comparisons**

* Screen: Yes, it is much bigger. It is by far the most comfortable phone for me to use with two hands. I never have to squint or strain at all to read anything on this screen. The colors are slightly truer and more muted than the Nexus 5, but with software tweaks this is a non-issue. I happened to get one with the dreaded [yellow tint of death](https://forums.oneplus.net/attachments/yellloopo-jpg.78216/) but it does go away after a short-ish amount of time. 

* Speed: I flashed both phones to a fresh Cyanogenmod 12 to test this. It definitely feels a slight amount faster than my old Nexus, but my slight I mean SLIGHT. In day to day life I don't think it will really matter. In my two weeks of using the One as a daily driver I never had a "wow, that was fast" moment, and my Nexus was already plenty fast for me. Extreme power users may notice a bigger difference, but for the common man, an upgrade for speed alone is not worth it. 

* Vibration: The vibration on the Oneplus One sucks. It's tiny (I can't feel it in my pocket), is loud (makes a racket on my desk), and doesn't feel solid (haptic feedback doesn't feel "right" anymore). I love the solid, slow rumble of the Nexus. The vibration motor is actually very fast and powerful - if you grip it in your hand when it vibrates it actually feels very substantial - however, the weight of the phone makes the phone not vibrate enough when it is loose in the world (on a desk, in a loose pocket, etc.). The result is a loud sound as the motor whirs inside but the phone doesn't actually move all the much. They would have done much better to keep the vibration speed slower to actually rock the phone instead of buzzing. 

* Size: I think I have pretty average sized hands, especially when you factor in girl-sized hands. I could just wrap my hands around the Nexus 5 while using my thumb relatively comfortably around the entire screen, and it always felt very secure. The One is absolutely unwieldy to use with one hand. There is no way I can wrap my hand around the phone and use the thumb as well, so I am always cradling the phone in my hand instead of actually gripping it. I was terrified that if anyone bumped into me it would fly out of my hand. Using this thing in New York would be a nightmare.

* Camera: I'm not really a picture guy so I don't think I'm super qualified to talk about this aspect. 

* Audio: I listen to a lot of music and consider myself an audiophile. I used a Havi B3 Pro and a Grado SR325e to make this comparison. The One definitely has a flatter sound signature, but has just slightly more power than the Nexus 5. The B3 Pro is relatively difficult to drive, and usually requires around 80% to 100% power to hear reasonably. The One can comfortably play all files at around 60% to 75% power. However, my Nexus 5 on Cyanogenmod 12 got a huge boost in volume, and can now play files at around the same volume level as the one. As for sound quality, I have to give the Nexus 5 the edge. Using my Grados, I could just hear more details over the entire range with better separation and soundstage. The audio jack on the Nexus 5 also feels more solid than that of the One. It seems to me that the audio module in the One was one place where they cut costs to save. 

* Battery Life: Yeah, the One wins hands down. I'm a pretty moderate user and usually got through the day with more than 60% to 50% left in the tank. My Nexus 5 usually has around 30% with ElementalX kernel. I'm sure you could go two days on a single charge with the One if you thought just a little about saving power. No way could you do that with the Nexus. With custom kernels I'm sure the battery life will only get better. 

WHY I'M RETURNING IT

The size. That's really the only thing that bothers me. The size bothered me for the whole two weeks I was using it. Every time I held it in my hand I was afraid I would drop it. Sitting down meant the phone would dig into my hip - even walking up the stairs I was reminded of the phone in my pocket. I'm always on the go, so I need to use this phone quickly out and about. This phone just wasn't able to give that to me. The only time I really enjoyed using the phone was when i had a few minutes to sit down and browse while waiting for the bus or an appointment - otherwise, the screen size was more of an encumbrance than a benefit. I picked up my broken Nexus 5 after a few days of only using the One and I absolutely loved how it fit into my hand. The benefits of the One just don't make up for having a portable device - which is, after all, what a phone is. To me, the One felt like a tablet with phone functionality than a phone. If the One were a five inch phone with the same dimensions as the Nexus, I would have kept it, no question. 

I purchased a replacement screen for my Nexus and will try my hand at repairing it myself. 

TL;DR: Got the Oneplus One after I shattered my Nexus 5's screen, loved it, but it was just too big for me to use comfortably on the go. Will be returning it and trying to repair my Nexus 5 myself.  




 Lay them out to dry and shape them back into their general shape. It's called blocking. 




 They make [Docker's Alpha Standard Tapered](http://us.dockers.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=57080986 cp=2271557.34412696 ab=men_LeftNav_collections_DockersAlphaCollection_StandardTapered_08082013). 




 Not sure how to do it, but the print technique used is most likely transfer printing or vinyl printing, if that helps your search. 




 They are more commonly called no-show socks, and won't even come up to your ankle. 




 Return the newly shipped item with the old receipt.  




 If there are no belt loops I would say do not use a belt. It will get out of place and just look bad. 

Additionally the material of the coat and said belt would have to match perfectly for it to look like the belt is meant to be there. Using a cloth belt on a wool coat would look like you just threw the belt on randomly and it will look out of place. I'm going to guess you got a wool overcoat, which means you would need some sort of wool belt. As for color, I think a contrast belt might be cool (black coat, light gray belt) but it absolutely HAS to be the same material. 

I'd say either try to find a belt and then post a fit-pic here or just rock it as is.  




 I used to be super self-conscious about how I looked to everyone when I first started dressing better. I would always check my appearance in every window I passed and would constantly look down to makes sure everything was in place. Eventually you get used to it. Took me about two months to stop thinking about my clothes constantly when I was out. 

You look great, dude! Keep at it!  




 American Eagle has some nice, well fitting ones. On clearance right now.  




 They are a little less formal than a pea coat or a top coat. Very versatile coat that is much less common than pea coats. 

You can't go wrong with [Gloverall](http://www.gloverall.com/), who basically invented the duffle coat.

[Schott](https://www.schottnyc.com/products/satin-lined-duffle-coat.htm?catID=9) also sells some quality duffles. [This](https://www.schottnyc.com/products/short-duffle.htm?catID=9) short option is a nice modern twist on the traditional long coat. 

Since it is a little less formal, I would recommend a less formal color, such as a light gray, olive, or camel.  




 I just recently picked up a pair of Unbranded 201s. We'll see if my opinion changes once they fade.
