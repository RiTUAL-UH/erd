 The title is a direct quote from the article, which in turns comes from a fairly respectable blog. (By which I mean it doesn't usually post clickbait-y stuff.) 




 I've said it here before and I'll say it again. The most important piece of advice I got in my Barbri class back in the day was this: the bar exam is a pass/fail exam, and every point you get above passing is wasted time you could have spent with loved ones, reading a good book, or watching a movie. 




 It's laid-back. Students work hard and play hard, but aren't in competition against other students. I've never heard of someone refusing to help someone, or hiding books, or not sharing notes, etc., the way I've heard horror stories out of some other schools, nor do Dartmouth students try to one-up each other with test scores or grades. 









 There was one on the Rockville/Bethesda border at the White Flint Mall, but the mall is gone. 




 (For that matter, until D B opens, are there any other decent arcades in the area?) 




 I hope it still opens. I am rather looking forward to it! I miss the one at White Flint. 




 Thank you! We'll give it a try. :) 




 *le sigh* I try one more google search as a last ditch effort after hitting submit, and I think I may have answered my own questionis it this? http://www.tracking-system.com/news/3-tracking-system-information/992-gps-device-accuracy-in-city-environments-.html 




 This may be a wacky question, but my google fu came up empty so I thought I'd ask here. My GF and I both have Verizon service. She has an iPhone 6, and I have the 6s. She's new to NY, I'm new as a weekend visitor, and we've both found that GPS on our phones w/ Google Maps is a lot less accurate in NY than it is elsewhere. GPS often has us in the middle of buildings or one street over when we're walking around. Is that normal? 




 Great book. I highly recommend it. It's simultaneously interesting, entertaining, and disturbing. 




 Those who chose to work with Vichy France WERE held accountable. 




 You may want to look at some of the other Pentagon City/Crystal City area apartments too, like RiverHouse, Crystal House, and the Buchanan buildings. (Water Park Towers in Crystal City is nice but more expensive than Park at Pentagon Row last I heard.) 




 My favorite reditor in my favorite forum? Be still my heart!!!!!! 




 Respectful? Polite? You said that Reform temples and rabbis makes things up as they go along, which directly led to the ragequit the OP refers to. 




 Israel also banned the Kach party in the early 90s, and to this day, they're considered a terrorist organization. Their closest counterpart in the Palestinian world, Hamas, was elected to run the Gaza Strip. Israel does indeed do the right things at times. It also does bad things at times. Few countries can be said to be all one or the other. 




 /r/holocaust , unfortunately. 




 Yep. That's what he's saying. So much for being a non-denominational subreddit. 




 If I understand correctly, you are arguing that the only legitimate form of Judaism is Orthodox Judaism, and in the process, ignoring rule 3 and 4 (3: disagreeing without being disagreeable) (4: this is a non-denomination subreddit). 




 The Torah also explicitly states that wearing clothing from two different fabrics isn't for us, and I don't particularly give a darn if my shirt is 100% cotton or a cotton/rayon blend. I also don't execute neighbors that work on Shabbat.

But I'll move beyond picking at anachronistic portions of the Torah that nobody follows, and move to your question of what carries weight beyond the Torah. (And note that I am certainly not claiming that the Torah itself carries *no* validity.) Modern interpretations may carry validity. Modern practice may carry validity. For many in the Reform, Conservative, Renewal, Reconstructionist, and Renewal movements, the laws of kashrut are not mandatory, be it congregants who never keep kosher, or who only keep kosher at home, or who make exceptions only for Chinese food. For many in the above movements, welcoming and sanctifying same-sex relationships, Leviticus be damned, is the right thing to do.

Intermarriage is just one more issue where Jewish thought and how the issue is treated across synagogues is not uniform. 




 We name things after people to honor them. We don't put all the names of historic figures in a hat and draw one out when naming a school or street, and we don't randomly generate names by computer. Naming a school after a figure is a celebration of them. There's a reason Alexander Hamilton is on the $10 bill and not Aaron Burr. 




 My goodness, you're in a cantankerous mood today. 

In some religions, or subsections of religion, there is a hierachical structure, with an authority figure or figures at the top, be it a Pope (Catholic) or President (LDS), or a council, or other governing body. Judaism doesn't have that for the most part (the exception being the Chassidic movement where many follow the teachings of a particular Rabbi and his line of succession). There is a wide body of opinions on most topics in Judaism, even within a particular movement.

Because there is no authoritative answer that would cover every person identifying as Jewish, our opinions are fairly irrelevant without more details-details that would require a conversation with the person in question that would negate the need to ask us anything in the first place.

If we were a hierarchical religion, like, for example, Catholicism, we could answer the OP's question by citing the Pope, Cardinals, past Popes, etc. Given the decentralized nature of Judaism, sure, we could point to a Talmudic source or a modern-day rabbi, but there's no reason to think that the source we might point to here carries the same line of thinking as OP's love interest. 




 At no point did I say that faith does not count, /u/ibay770. I'm saying the opinions offered here probably don't count very much given the diversity of thought across Judaism. 




 Remember  celebrating. 




 This was pretty much the Supreme Court's reasoning in the lethal injection case last weekthe method was upheld by a 5-4 majority because the petitioners did not supply the Court with less problematic alternatives to the drug cocktail at issue. 




 No need for your to apologizeit's a common expression. 




 I don't wish to seem condescending, so if this is something you know already, I'm sorry. Jews don't have a pope-like figure. There is no one single figure who represents all of Judaism, or even all of one of the Jewish movements (like Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, etc.) So you're not going to a single, authoritative answer.

Without knowing what branch of judaism the woman you're interested in is affiliated with, we can't offer much insight into what her religious reasoning might be, beyond the traditional argument against intermarriage based on children and our small numbers already.

But really, this is a discussion you need to have with the woman in question. Respecting her as a person may mean that her religious beliefs really are an insurmountable barrier. Or not. But talking with her, and more importantly, listening to her, is far more important than the religious views of the folks here. 




 It's also worth noting that HIPAA doesn't just cover health care providers who are currently in the business of transmitting health info. electronically in connection with certain transactions  it covers health care providers who have EVER done so. The moment a health provider sends one single health record electronically, they are  permanently and irrevocably covered by HIPAA. 




 Trump may be able to recover unpaid rent, but surely only until the space is filled. I suspect he can't double-dip by getting damages from Andres AND rent from a different restaurateur (or other use of the space). As for an exclusivity clause, it depends on the specific text. Andres already operates a slew of other DC restaurants, so I'd be very surprised if he signed a contract prohibiting him from opening other restaurants in the area. Perhaps not a restaurant exactly mirroring the concept for the Trump hotel, but no new restaurants? That would be a dumb thing to sign. Maybe he did, but it would be surprising. 




 Amazon.com's choice to remove the Southern Flag was a capitalistic response to market demands. 




 Same way you'd report any other crimecall the police. 




 I used Bookstore Movers 2 years ago and loved them. Not the cheapest hourly rate out there, but they were careful, fast, and honest. You may well do better with their higher hourly rate but speed over a lollygagging low bidder. 




 The last I've read, he was not a lawyer-to be a lawyer, one must have a law license and not merely be a law school graduate. He graduated law school, he passed the bar exam, but as of May, the Virginia Character and Fitness committee did not yet render an opinion on whether to admit or deny his application to get a Virginia law license. No license=not a lawyer. 




 No different than than the U.S. Constitution. If a president were to be impeached, or a judge, etc., removal from office is the worst penalty the Senate could impose.  




 How so? 




 You'll "unregister" your car when you return your plates.

Don't forget to update renters or homeowners insurance.

Remember that you'll need to get your car inspected in VA-you may want to ask a VA mechanic to look your car over first to avoid painful surprises.

You'll be taxed for the part of the year you were in each place, I think? (My tax knowledge is quite minimal.) You WILL want to make sure you let your hob's HR folks know to withhold for VA instead of MD-I made that mistake when I moved. The refund from MD was nice, paying VA out of pocket before getting yang refund sucked.

Will you need a moving co? (I loved Bookstore Movers, personally. I have no affiliation with them, other than being really happy 2 years ago when they helped me.)

Do you have a landline and need to port the number? 




 PMed. :) 




 We usually get paid on Tuesdays by EFT, with checks going out two days later (although since I thought direct deposit was mandatory, the latter might just be an anachronism on the calendar)? 

I spoke to a veteran in the agency who said that it means we have to get our TA in earlier, it needs to be approved earlier, etc., but pay will still run on the usual day the following week. 




 If an agency sends out a notice saying that time and attendance (TA) is due early because of the holiday, with TA due on June 25th, TA edits happening on June 26th, all TA including corrections to the processing center by the 30th, and pay calculation happening on June 30th, does that mean EFT pay will be going out on June 30th for that pay period, or will it be going out as scheduled on July 6th?

Or in tl;dr/EL5 terms, what does early pay calculation mean? 




 Where does one sign up if interested in being coached? 




 Scalia's dissent was petulant. 

Chief Justice Robert's majority opinion was sassy: "It is implausible that Congress meant the Act to operate in this manner. See National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting) (slip op., at 60) (Without the federal subsidies . . . the exchanges would not operate as Congress intended and may not operate at all.)." 




 Today's decision was NOT a "favor" to the law (nor was the first decision). Today's decision was basic statutory construction. It is not ideological (and it certainly is not in any way unusual or rare) to read statutory language in context of the entire section or statute.

In February during oral arguments for Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., Scalia said "When we look at a provision of law, we look at the entire provision of law, including later amendments...We try to make sense of the law as a whole."

In Justice Thomas's majority (and unanimous) opinion in 1997's Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., he wrote, "The plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole."

There's nothing new about looking at the specific content of a statute's language and to the broader context of the statute as a whole.

As for Scalia, Thomas, and Alito's dissent in King v. Burrell, they are being intentionally disingenuous. As the Chief Justice pointed out in today's majority opinion, in Scalia's dissent (joined by Thomas and Alito) in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (AKA the first Obamacare Supreme Court case), Scalia said that without the Federal subsidies, "the exchanges would not operate as Congress intended and may not operate at all."

We look at statutes in context. As Scalia, Thomas, and Alito noted,  the subsidies were required for the law to operate as Congress intended. 




 Scalia suggested calling it SCOTUSCare because it's been before the Supreme Court twice and upheld twice. out of curiosity, how many times has the Supreme Court upheld the death penalty, and does this mean we should have pictures of the conservative justices on the walls of every death chamber in the country? 




 Not according to the South Carolina delegates: in the Dec. 24, 1860 Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union, South Carolina's delegates stated that they fought for slavery and against a state's right to refuse to return runaway slaves and against a state's right to not allow slave owners to bring slaves into their territory 




 There's no such thing as a secret Jewish-only networking event for industry players. That's an anti-semitic stereotype. 









 The Angry Bird franchise had to get its inspiration from something... 




 Yikes. Gotcha. Thanks! 




 I didn't even see the move. How did they pick his pocket? 




 Not all tofu dishes are intended to be a meat substitute. Many are, but there are plenty of East Asian dishes where tofu is part of a meat-based dish. For example, while mapo tofu is often westernized as a meatless dish, it is traditionally a tofu/ground pork dish.

EDIT: And nevermind. I should downvote myself for this one-I didn't notice the "vegetarian menu" part of your comment. Sorry. Tofu dishes and meat is common in some Asian cuisines, but they don't belong on a vegetarian menu. 




 Neat! Thanks for the response-I'll give that one a try! 




 Exactly this. My personal favorite quote from that decision is "[o]ne man's vulgarity is another's lyric. 

We know this is unconstitutional, /u/repealedlaw. I'd go so far as to say that it is such settled law, police officers who arrest people for swearing are likely to not have qualified immunity from a civil suit. 




 Actually, no, but that sounds like an interesting app! :) Does it give you a new WTF fun fact every day, or is it a database of WTF fun facts, or...? 




 It was a sawed-off shotgun, and this was 1946 so cameras themselves weren't "so small." 




 Yep. It did. http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1947/01/07/page/1/article/camera-case-fugitive-slain-in-gun-battle

 I did three searches on Reddit to make sure this wasn't already posted. :P It was such a neat story, I was surprised this was the first mention of it! 




 Sorry-it was an original source, as opposed to other pages that cited this one, so I thought it was the best choice. 




 The New Yorker article said:
"ANNALS OF CRIME about the accidental shooting of Olga Trapani Rocco by Pearl Lusk, which resulted in the victim's losing her leg. This occurred in the Times Sq. subway station on Dec. 31, 1946. Pearl thought she was taking a picture of Olga, instead she was pulling the trigger of a swaed-off shotgun. Pearl, 19, and out of work, was picked up by an attractive man in the subway. He told her to shadow Olga and take her photo with the wrapped-up camera he gave her, as Olga was concealing stolen jewelry in her clothing Actually, the man was Alphonse Rocco and he was Olga's husband. She had separated from him and he wanted her back. When she refused to go back he threatened to kill her. She told the police and got protection but no one suspected the lengths Rocco would go to. The police trailed him to the Catskills. He would not surrender and tried shooting it out with the police and was killed himself. Olga could not recover any damages from the City as no proof of negligence on the part of the police department could be shown. They had no legal duty to protect her from Pearl, an unidentified individual." 



















 Perjury is a criminal offense. It carries jail time. Is the risk worth $75? Really? 




 According to the Tenant-Landlord Handbook, "Tenants may be charged...if there is excessive damage to walls." Whether or not the scuff marks constituted excessive damage is impossible to judge from your question. It could depend on several factors included the expected lifespan of the paint, how deep the scuffing went, how many scuff marks there were, etc. 

I don't know if this is the sort of question they can answer, but it couldn't hurt for you to call or email the county's housing division: http://housing.arlingtonva.us/get-help/rental-services/tenant-landlord-rights/

(Also, to settle my curiosity/concern given that I live in an apartment complex in Arlington, VA, mind PMing me with the name of the complex? :P ) 




 Moreover, in a large swath of downtown DC, biking on the sidewalk is illegal (Central Business District). 




 Hamas is defining occupation as the State of Israel itself. Not what was captured in 1967, but the 1948 borders. Not much room for negotiation on Israel's part! 




 Oh for Pete's sake. Here is the Coca-Cola's website with an interview with Mr. T. Here is Mr. T's verified Twitter account, where there's a picture of him in the butterfly gear: https://twitter.com/mrt/status/607978622767505408

It's Mr. T. 




 Not exactly. I mean, I suppose it has worked out that way, but I posed the link, as did others, in response to redditors who thought it wasn't really Mr. T in the photo. 




 Not fake. http://www.fuzebev.com/ 




 Except it is Mr. T. http://www.fuzebev.com/ 




 In many states, where this would be a simple speeding ticket, no, you wouldn't need a lawyer. But this is Virginia, where it is a criminal matter. (See http://jalopnik.com/never-speed-in-virginia-lessons-from-my-three-days-in-1613604053 ) Beyond the potential for, you know, having to spend time in jail, it can affect security clearances, employment, and all other sorts of things.

Get an attorney. Get the best one you can find/afford. And do it immediately. 




 Not in store, but they do online, and it's covered by the same guarantee (and can even be returned in-store). Costco sells the Charge but not the Charge HR. 




 She wasn't there with her husband according to the Globe. 




 More that he's proving the point that he and his ilk hate Jews and not just Israel. 




 I'd suggest Nordstroms or Macy's for their return policiespretty much a money back guarantee without time limit. 




 Because that would add on to the cost. 




 Pretty much. If you work for the Federal government and you're not in a sensitive position or in a sensitive agency, your salary, position, agency, grade level, bonuses paid, and duty location are all a matter of public record, available online.  




 I recommend the HR due to the difference in bands. I tried the Charge, and found that it fell off easily. The Charge HR has a watch-style band and clasp that is much, much more secure.

 There's many things to do at Dartmouth. As /u/qweasd1515 said, if you want to make outdoorsy things your life, you can. If you never want to go into the woods (although I encourage you to at least go on a first year trip), you can. And its easy to do a mix, spending some of your time doing outdoorsy things.

Beyond outdoorsy things, there's the Greek system, there's a zillion clubs, there's all the great speakers Dartmouth brings to campus, every Presidential candidate pretty much stops at Dartmouth during a campaign cycle, there's journalism and writing opportunities, video and board games people, and fantastic performing artists you can see for about $5 as opposed to the $50-$100 a ticket they charge elsewhere. (*sob* I miss cheap tickets. :P)

Is there any social stuff in particular you are looking for that one of us may be able to tell you about how/if its available at Dartmouth?

My friend Anisha's father passed away on May 28th, and she is trying to raise money to cover the funeral expenses, with any overrun going to honoring his name by helping people wishing to further their arts education. (Details on the Go Fund Me page.)

Anisha's dad, Paul, lived with Alzheimer's for the past 10 years. Anisha became her parents' caretakers 5 years ago. A few years ago, Anisha beat cancer. And tomorrow is her 30th birthday.

She didn't ask me to share this here, but she did ask me generally to pass this on to my contacts and networks. Any financial assistance you can provide, however small, would be appreciated. 




 Their Bethesda location closed a few years ago too.
 




 GAH! I got my first call from them today at 11, and my second one today at 1. I reported the call to the DEA, not that I expect that will help but one never knows. 




 And it goes beyond phone calls: http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/27/us/fifa-corruption-investigation-why/ 




 It doesn't matter where the stadiums are being built. And the severity of the charge has to do with the criminal acts alleged, and not merely the phone calls themselves. Phone calls and the like provide for jurisdiction, that's enough to theoretically get the FIFA defendants into a U.S. courtroom to face charges for the totality of their conduct that has a U.S.-based nexus. 




 The Constitution trumps the U.S. Code. Texas v. Johnson is the controlling case when it comes to attempts to ban flag desecration. 




 You may not be in the U.S., but you committed an act within the United States.

If someone on the Mexican side of the Mexico/U.S. border lobs a hand grenade over the border, they've committed a crime in both Mexico AND the U.S.

If you're outside the U.S., but call, email, fax, or otherwise cause ties within the U.S. in the commission of a violation of U.S. law, there may be grounds to charge you for it.

It's not personhood, it's that you committed an act within the U.S. that was criminal or in furtherance of a crime. 




 In and of itself, calling someone isn't a crime. Calling someone in furtherance of a bribery and/or wire fraud scheme is a criminal act.

Nobody is going to take the time and effort to indict you (nor can I see a country extraditing for it)  for calling someone in the US and asking them to buy you a small quantity of drugs for personal use. A big enough purchase to nail you as a drug dealer? Yes, it's quite possible. 




 http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/05/27/how-the-us-can-arrest-fifa-officials-in-switzerland-explained/?hpid=z1

The short summary is that the crimes alleged had an element that took place in the U.S., be it a visit (that was part of the crime) to the U.S., a call (that was part of the crime) to a person in the U.S., or some other jurisdictional nexus.

Under the U.S. extradition treaty with Switzerland, the Swiss won't extradite for tax-related crimes, but will for most other offenses. Whether that holds true when its members of a powerful worldwide group like FIFA remains to be seen, but that the Swiss cooperated in making the arrest is a promising sign. 




 There were so many things I went to last year (only three of which involved paying money for a pic, autograph, or Maurice LaMarche recording my voicemail message as the Brain), that I didn't get around to the board gaming area. I hope to do it this year, but no guarantees. :P 




 As far as I know, Rob will (along with other Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle voice actors), Maurice will not, but Jim Cummings (Winnie the Pooh, Darkwing Duck, etc.) will be there, Phil LaMarr will be there, etc. 




 There's nothing new or original about certain things falling outside the laws of surrounding areas, given that every state has its own set of criminal laws. What is legal in Kittery may be illegal across the Piscataqua River in Portsmouth, or vice versa.

The US approach to the sovereignty of Indian tribes is not unique in the world. The status and sovereignty of Canada's First Nations is largely controlled by Royal Proclamation of 1763. The status and sovereignty of the Mori people of New Zealand is large controlled by the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi. Issues of Native sovereignty and jurisdiction continues to be a source of struggle, tensions, collaboration, and the like in the US, Canada, and New Zealand alike, but it most certainly is not a unique problem in the world.

EDIT: Bwah? I've been downvoted for pointing out the factual inaccuracies in someone's comment, who turned around and deleted said comment (after my response) when it didn't stand up to scrutiny. Lovely. 




 My GF knew it as: "...These little children are asking you, To please come out so we can play with you..."

I knew it as: "Here comes a hunter with a big shotgun. He's gonna get you if you don't start to run..." 




 My girlfriend and I randomly started singing Mr. Sun, Sun, Mr. Golden Sun the other day, and we were quite surprised that our notions of the lyrics to the bridge of the song differed widely.

I googled it, and came up fairly dry about the origins of the song. This is pretty much what I found: http://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=44759

Can anyone explain the origins, or what your notion is of the proper lyrics? 









 I went to Awesome Con last year and had a fantastic time at the panels, getting a few photos (with Rob Paulsen and Maurice LaMarche, Cary Elwes, and Ernie Hudson), and walking around the floor.

There are some fantastic panels this year (hearing from George Takei may well be worth the cost of admission alone. He has a compelling personal story, both as one of the first prominent out Asian-Americans, as well as as a person who grew up in a Japanese internment camp). And the voice actors reading from a movie script is not to be missed! (Last year, they read Ghostbuster scenes.)
 









 As opposed to cash, sure. But it's no different than the information gathered if one pays by credit card. 




 Fuck that. In the words of Supreme Court Justice Harlan in Cohen v. California, "One man's vulgarity is another man's lyric." 




 I'll second Good Stuff Eatery's mushroom burger as being delicious, and We the Pizza next door (same owners) has good vegetarian and meat pizzas.

On 23rd, Urban Thai is really good and does takeout and delivery. 




 The most important thing I was told the first week of BarBri was that the bar exam is a pass/fail exam, and every point above passing is time you could have spent with loved ones, friends, sleep, or hobbies.

 Anything by Isa Chandra Moskowitz is usually worthwhile. The Veganomicon, Vegan with a Vengeance, Isa Does It, etc. 




 Seconded. It's easy to accidentally hurt your case when an insurance company goads you into blurting things out. Even as a lawyer myself, when the other person's insurance company started playing hardball after their insured driver rear-ended me in Georgetown (not far from where you were hit, actually), I stopped dealing with them and got my own lawyer. 




 A new bridge to VA would be fantastic, but would cost far more than the purple line, and would probably require coordination with Virginia that is unlikely to happen any time soon.

The Purple Line isn't throwing money at Bethesdait would go from Bethesda to New Carrollton in PG County, and includes stops in Silver Spring, Takoma Park, College Park (including UMD), etc. It would be positive for all of those areas, not just Bethesda. There would be the capacity for future capacity over the Wilson bridge, too.

It takes about 13 minutes by car without traffic to go from Bethesda to Silver Spring. It takes 20 minutes without traffic by bus. During rush hour, it takes a lot longer and the bus is worse than cars because the stops it makes amplifies traffic delays. It takes 45 minutes to go by metro currently because you have to go through the heart of DC and then back out again via the red line. The purple line would get from the Bethesda Metro Station to the Silver Spring Metro Station in 5 stops on a dedicated light rail. That makes a huge difference to people commuting, considering shopping, to people opening up or relocating businesses, etc. Major economic benefits can ensue.

I have no horse in this race. I don't even live in Montgomery County any moreI moved across the river to improve my commute from taking an hour to 15 minutes. But that's kinda my pointspeedy transit matters to people. 




 Of which Maryland is not paying full-freight, thanks to the Federal grant. And it is not as though Hogan is planning to actually take the money to fund school construction-he wants to put it towards roads, so either way, it's a heck of a lot of money towards transportation. The question is where would the best bang for the buck come from, and public transportation is a strong investment. 




 I enjoy the Sunday night trivia at Sine in Pentagon City. It's one of the pub trivias run by District Trivia. http://www.district-trivia.com 




 Marketing is the difference between a shoe and an unapproved new medical device. When it comes to the laws and regulations surround food, drugs, cosmetics, dietary supplements, and medical devices, the type of health-related claims one makes changes the regulatory scheme attached to a product. 




 I don't think you'll have a major difference in experience being 22 or 23 than anyone else, assuming that as a transfer, you wouldn't be there for 4 more years or anything. We have some older students, some due to discipline, academic, medical or other issues requiring them to take time off or extra time.

I personally only applied to Dartmouth (early decision). Had early decision not been an option, I'd have applied to a wide variety of schools, including several ivies, because who knows where you might get in, but it's not as though all Ivy League schools are equal. The experience you would have at Dartmouth is VERY different than the experience at Harvard, which is VERY different from the experience at Cornell, etc. 




 I believe what reaganveg is saying is that Freddie Gray was injured, in the van, before the second prison (aka the "witness", as reganveg put it) was in the van. 




 People come to pescatarianism for different reasons, just as people come to vegetarianism for different reasons (religious, ethical, health, etc.) As pescatarianism is not a commonly understood word (take a survey, and I'd be willing to bet a high percentage of Americans would think it was a religion and not a diet), when rsvping for parties, weddings, etc., it is often easier for pescatarians to say they are vegetarian, to ensure they don't get a meat-based meal. 




 *nods* It's good to ask, since I had a different experience than /u/treacherouseel. When I interned for the general counsel's office of a federal law enforcement agency, it was suit and tie every day. A fellow intern asked if on Fridays, we could go sans tie. The answer was no. (The law enforcement officers themselves were in jeans and t-shirts!) 




 I mean no disrespect, truly (not a troll), but if physical therapy, steroid shots, and a brace didn't work, what might be left other than surgery? Not that it would be a good idea to get surgery without being reasonably sure of what the underlying issue is, but it sounds like you have gone through the common non-surgical options already?

That said, I'm no doctor. Joel Morse in NW DC is a great podiatrist, and he may be able to help you. http://www.foxhallpodiatry.com 




 Based on my hiring date, I have to pay 3.1% of my paycheck towards retirement, so I make 2.3% less than someone of the same grade, doing the same job, hired a year earlier than me. That's not great for morale either. 




 There are still a few iPad-only apps I use. My favorite iOS game is Risk, which is strangely iPad only, even though it would look just fine on an iPhone 6 plus, or even the iPhone 6.
