 Want to fight about it? 




 I just shave my own head. It's cheap and it can look really good. Thanks man :) 




 Thanks bro. Yeah a friend painted them for my birthday right before she passed away. That was a few years ago but they remind me of her everyday :) 




 Man that brought years to my eyes. It's been so fucking hard and I've missed so much school but I am very smart (Not trying to brag sorry) and I finished with very good grades. This summer I am so fucking hyped for, I'm going to Denmark and I'm going to meet one of my best friends for the first time. I've only started taking Sertralin. I think this summer will either make me, or break me. 




 Thank you for the kind words. I will hopefully do better during the summer with medication.  




 Not saying it's even close to dying but it can hurt.  




 That was stupidly hillarious. 




 Noone has said anything about that they should die. 




 Do you think postning pictures of yourself, posing with your dead child is a good way to deal with loss? BS, I don't belive you.   




 This guy is high as a kite.  




 I DAG R JAG STARK! 




 Yeah I understand what you mean, but money will sure as hell makes it easier to do what you want in life. The quote says "Life is unfair to everyone" and I don't think it means that unfair to everyone = everyones unhappy, I meant that unfair = not being able to do things some rich people can do. Idk if that makes much sense(?) O.o 




 Well it's not really a good quote since there are people born into poverty and people born rich. I would like it too if it was true. 




 Welcome  









 Behold! The proud mutilated one in the never ending jerk !

 Fan tycker synd om killen. Att ha en talnedsttning kan fan inte vara ltt.

 Edit: nMom* in the title

Ok context, my underage friend  is looking to buy a small pet. He doesn't know anything about pets and neither do I, so I asked my mother. I asked if you need to sign any papers or show id when purchasing a guinepig or anything like that. The first thing she does is scream "WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH A RAT ARE YOU GOING TO TOURTURE IT?!"  . 

You can really feel the trust in the air amiright. 




 You should really check with the flightcompany since every company has diffrent policies about animals onboard  




 SWEDEN YES! 




 Herregud jag kommer ihg det! Jag blev jtte hypad nr 6riga jag sg det ligga i hyllan. Morsan kpte det och what do you know, kunde inte komma ut ur frsta cutscenen utan att det crash datorn. Skulle vldigt grna spela det igen och faktist komma lngre n 0.5% av spelet. 




 I'd say this is more /r/WTF. Your mom is a nut. 




 Ok so you are saying that people that have abusive parents should celebrate them for failing horribly at being a parent, rolemodel and guardian? Not sure I see the logic in that. 
Everyone does not have good realationships with their parents. 




 Det r vll en skmt video? Ser inget pinsamt med att bjuda p sigsjlv.

 Anne Frankly I think that joke is ghastly!  




 Just becuase they might be blood, does not give them the right to be in your life. Remove the weeds from your life.
