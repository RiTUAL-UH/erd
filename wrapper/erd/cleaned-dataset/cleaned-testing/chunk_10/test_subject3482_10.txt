 Glad I could help. Pm me if you have trouble finding Junior HR roles. Sales sounds intimidating but it's not that bad really but understand your reticence on that front.  




 Try and get an entry-level job in public relations / communications. Your writing experience will help immensely and there is a career path there. You could also consider a career in HR. 

1. There are a lot of entry-level jobs here:

Look at the ones in sales, or project management

2. here is a list of junior HR jobs:

3. Junior ad sales could be an interesting opportunity:

With your credentials, and openness to moving, you will likely be able to find a job if you try but you may need a pick a few areas and zoom in. Picking a field like HR, PR or sales is a good one because it gives you a career path as opposed to a job given that you are tired of doing lots of different gigs and starting over.  




 I totally understand how you feel. If you are at a  large firm that is on the downturn, older employees who have been there longer can get a little political and insecure when they see a younger employee "over-do" it or try to show that they are working hard. That's not to say that thats the case in this situation - it's very possible that you are misreading their general insecurities as resentment. 

To stay on good-terms with your coworkers:
1. Be helpful. Try and make sure you are a team player. Maybe its me but reading your posts and comments, I get the feeling that you are measuring output in lines of code you produce rather than projects you help your team accomplish. Software engineering is a team sport so make sure you are focused on the teams objectives instead of just your own part of the puzzle. You will learn more that way too.

2. Stop measuring your output in term of time either.  Having been  code for a long time and worked with developers - beyond 40-50 hours a week, hours spent is rarely correlated with quality of work. If you want to learn more and be more valuable - spend the time learning the bigger objectives of the project /company and use your down time to research / get smarter and help with those objectives. 

3. Don't speculate about how your coworkers feel about you. Ask them. Given you are new there, ask your coworkers out for coffee on occasion - and ask them for tips and guidance and their thoughts on how you could be more productive with the team. 

I agree with other commenters that if you are a good engineer - the market is good enough where you won't lack for a job. But if you are going to work with the mindset that people are going to get fired and you don't want to - then you will absolutely give off a competitive vibe and coworkers will pick up on that. Instead you should go to work with a mindset of how I can help the team move forward.  









 Try out customer experience jobs at startups. They are generally open to people without a degree, some support remote work, and will allow you to build a career within an organization and hopefully grow as the space and the company grow. Jobs like these:

One note - any are based in NY or SF so you might need to move and those are expensive cities. But your admin and retail sales skills should work in your favor and hopefully it gives you a start to finding a career.

 



















 Part of your problem might be that your confidence has taken a hit since you graduated especially with that last job and that can often come across in your resume and your interviews.

There are a lot of interesting jobs in media where you can potentially get in on the ground floor and work your way up. A few options (with examples of types of jobs are below)

1. Try a a digital media startup. Your media background will come in handy and as the space explodes, you have a chance to get your foot in the door and grow alongside the company. 

Jobs like these:

An events coordinator, or social media associate might not be the most glamorous or high paying out of the gate but can get you in the door, and be a platform to build a career.

2. Consider a career related to the media but in sales. Something like ad sales. Hugely coveted and getting more an more important. Something like these:
http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs

An account exec job if you feel you have the people skills and sales demeanor or a yield analyst job if you are more quantitative  oriented

3. Maybe a junior marketing job at an entertainment company. Like these:
http://tapwage.com/channel/the-audience-chase

You may need to start as an intern or a planning assistant. But you will likely get paid and again have a chance at building a career in the space.

If you are a good video producer or video editor, there are interesting jobs out there too but those tend to be freelance so unless you have the hustle and really want that career, it can be hard to eke a career out of that. 

Good luck and feel free to pm me with further qs.  




 You could get an engineering degree but that won't necessarily translate to a great aviation job here in the US. You could instead do the following:

1. Work at an aviation related startup - like SpaceX, or Virgin Galactic or GoPro, or a big company doing aviation related projects They all need talented technology professionals and you could be great at those. Check these out:
http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=aviation+aerospace+software SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=

Even google needs talented technology / software professionals on aviation related projects

2. Go to a big aerospace company like Boeing, Lockheed, etc. They all need great software engineers

3. Also get your private pilots license if you can (it's pricey ~$20-25k in the US) but gettable over a few years and really worth it. Maybe you could even get a job building / testing drones

Engineering is an interesting path but it's a bit commitment and it isn't clear that it will necessarily get you a meaningfully better or more directly aviation related role at these companies.

 how? That's amazing. Even the nicer pool sticks on eBay seem to be $80-100.  




 I agree. I used to drive 30 minutes to work. Now I take a 15 minute train ride (different city). Such a big difference. Less road rage, I get to read and get composed for the day ahead. Commute is so important and so underrated.  



















 If you want a robot reading a book to you, there are plenty of options but they just aren't very good. 

I subscribed to instapaper briefly to listen to articles on the way to work but I couldn't really survive a single one. They just feel too clunky. The Guardian has a free "audio long reads" where authors read their articles out. Many are really really good and they make for great podcast equivalents.
