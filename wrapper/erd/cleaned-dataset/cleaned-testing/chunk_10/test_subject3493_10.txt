 Me and my friends just wanted to play a game.We didn't think it would end up like this, I didn't think I would be here in this situation. I don't know how much time I have before..  Let me start at the beginning. It was Friday night, and the weekend was just around the corner and that means free time, lots of free time. My friends and I, normally get together and have a party of sorts. Sometime we throw big ones, other times its just us.This weekend we decided it was just going to be us. Few hours later, We're all sitting of the couch watching TV.
"Lets play a game" Ryan says, my roommate.
 "a game? what kinda game?" ask tom, my best friend.
" oh, nothing much, Its like truth or dare" Ryan says.
"like?" I speak up. 
"yeah man, its simple. We sit in a circle and place one had in the middle of us, and say a few words and then we ask each other truth or dare questions" Ryan says.
 "so its basically truth or dare? isn't that a little weird with just us?" tom asked, chuckling.
 "Nah man, you see cause we wont be talking" Ryan says
 "what do you mean?" i ask.
 "You'll see, lets play. come on" Ryan says.
tom an I look at each other, questioning this in our minds, then look back to Ryan and nod, giving him our approval. 
"alright, give me a few minuets  , ill be right back" Ryan says as he gets up and heads to his room.
 "leave it to Ryan to get us doing something weird" tom says
 "its just a little harmless game, though im confused to what he meant by we wont be talking"I say 
"ha ha, yeah, maybe it'll be gho-" "I'm back, lets get started" Ryan say interrupting tom.
 "OK so what do we do? " I ask.
"well, We sit in a circle. once we do that we place our hands on this peice of paper, and say this phrase "Aperire ostium mortuis messorem" three times"
"Aperire ostium what?" ryan and i asked "I dont know, sound latin, whats on the paper?" i ask
"nothing man, don't worry about it, trust me it'll be fun"
Not wanting to ruin possible fun and Going against my gut feeling I agreed.
 Oh man I should have said no.. I have to go (to be continued) 




 That every community for you, And most the time its lurkers or newcomes that dont know anything about the problems faced when allowing everyone through the gates, let alone the work put to develop the game, and make it online. when an error occurs or when it lags too much, or when maintenance takes too long. Those are the first to complain, from what ive seen. But the game is in beta still, open beta, but beta nevertheless. Bugs happen, and its our jobs as testers* to report the bugs,the glitches, and anything else problematic. It is also our job to suggest things to the developers.

*We become testers once the we start playing the alpha or beta, open or closed. 




 What is prestige? Like what happens when you do prestige? Do I want to Prestige? 




 So going to the tutorial place, after talking to the chick, right when you start, The whole place is bright yellow. Any idea how to fix it?
Im useing the Intel HD 4000, ik it isnt the ideal card for gaming, but its what i got. Any help would be much appreciated , especially from people who have the same card or an intel gpu 




 If anyone has played all the classes, Could you say which one was the most fun to play? I understand its a rather complicated question, since everyone's opinion of "fun" is a little different.
What was the most fun for you? 




 I feel like im trying crack for the first time, and Im being teased 




 Was about to post this update, someone beat me to the punch
 




 Which class looks the purttiest? 




 normally, in just about any mmo, the time frame they give for maintenance is usually off by 30mins-1hr , sometimes 2hrs but not often, they try to keep users in the loop about this. In my experience anyways 




 Thanks for the confirmation , looks like ill be in this for a long run. 




 I heard every class is obtainable, even gunner and berserker through simply playing the game,but it takes some time, is this true?
 




 I have no clue, as the first time ill be playing the game will be in a few mins, but Using logic, and assuming they were logical when developing skyforge, I say Yes you can progress properly. Doesnt make sense to not have it that way. not to me. but again, I know nothing so you shouldnt take my word for it.
