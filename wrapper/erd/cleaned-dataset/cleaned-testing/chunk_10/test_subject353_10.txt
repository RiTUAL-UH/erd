 Can you describe how you and the others looked like 




 So did you wake up right after you saw her? 




 Thats crazy mustve been pretty intense of a dream 




 You woke up with wet pants? Was it piss? 




 Thats intense as hell.  




 One of my dreams I was back at my parents house. it was pitch black outside and the only light was from the kitchen. Where my sister and little brother were in the kitchen. It felt like it was reality, I was in complete control of my actions. But I was walking towards the kitchen when I heard some noise coming from my sisters room. So i decide to check it out. Standing at the entrance of the hallway I felt a chilling breeze and a creepy puslating sound. The hallway seemed to get darker as I stared down it. Again I hear the noise of something moving around in my sisters room so I advance down the hallway. My sisters room is at the end of the hallway and my room is directly to the left. I walk up to the door and hear movement again but the puslating stopped. I am pretty scared at this point worried about what I might find. So I crack open my sisters door to reach for the lightswitch before fully opening the door. All of a sudden my bedroom door starts to creek open and out of fear and instinct I immediately shoulder check my door. Though it only budge a little open and I look up to see two bony hands with claws for nails and skin is a blood red. Im in shock to see half a face staring from behind the hands through the crack of the door. Within a second the door swings open and I stumble into this creature dressed in a raggedy black robe. Im staring it in the face at this point as it grins with little sharp teeth a horn for a chin and radiant yellow serpent eyes. Two horns stuck straight out on each side of its head. Then a gust of wind comes rushing through and send me flying into the wall. As Im sitting against the wall after falling looking up at this demon I cant help but feel hopelessness and paralyzed with fear. It creeps backwards into my room never turning its back to me and slowly creeps into my closet. Still poking its gead out to watch me, I finally regain some composure so I crawl backwards out of the hallway and started saying a prayer I remember from catholic school and a white light appears over me and then I wake up. So after I wake up I start pacing around my studio apartment. I walk outside to get some fresh air and the area is dead silent, no cars no one in sight on a friday night which is usually loud from people partying. In the distance I hear a women screaming like if she was in pain, chanting from some deep voices and a trumpet occasionally being blown. So I go back inside even more creeped out. I tried to go back to sleep but I ended up staring at the ceiling until it was time to get ready for work. 




 Now that is creepy as hell 




 Im curious of demonic dreams. I have had 2 creepy ones so far. I want to know your experience. 




 I wish they would stop their culture of being offended about things that dont apply to them
