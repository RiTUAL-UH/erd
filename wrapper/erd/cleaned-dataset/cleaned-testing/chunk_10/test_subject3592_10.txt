 That's exactly it. Thank of a single spot in space the the longboarder passes through every time they complete a circuit.

Now think of how much time the camera sees the longboarder versus the background. Clearly, the background is what is seen for a majority of the time. Since there's no extra light in the longboarder vs the background, the background is what shows up in the final picture!

You could do many things to change what shows up and get various results and degrees of "transparency" for the boarder dude/dudette  




 Have you seen the show Person of Interest? In the second and third seasons, one of the characters has a link to a super-powerful AI. I think the show handles it wonderfully, especially in some of the episodes of Season 3. It's worth a watch for inspiration! 




 I wish the choice was mine. Or I wish I had the strength to make the choice. 

Please leave me in my misery. It's quite peaceful here. 




 One of the things I hated about Spotify was that they didn't have Porcupine Tree (only two albums) or Steven Wilson (one album + a few songs). Apple music has a lot more...woooo! 




 She had stairs to climb at home, so she would wear them on and off, but certainly didn't wear them all the time. You'll be okay soon... Just hang in there. Take as much encouragement and as little advice from Internet stranger as possible. Your foot and doctor know best, so listen to both!

EDIT: By them I mean it :) 




 My friend had a stress fracture, and after six weeks, she was fine. Assuming yours is similar and not much more serious, It's just rest that you need. Once you get back to running, you'll start off slower of course, but you'll be back to your original form in a few weeks.

The important thing is to listen to your feet once the cast comes off, and not push it. Two years later, the few weeks you lose won't matter. But you'll regret it terribly if you push yourself and cause a more serious injury. 




 I think the OP meant that the hike took a day each way,  not that they stayed only for a day  




 I'm attending a friend's wedding in Switzerland and I then plan to hike along the via alpina from Geneva to Nice (about 550 km). Does anyone know the scene in terms of camping along there?

From what I read, there are a lot of huts. But are there enough that I won't need to take a tent along at all? What about a stove? 

Any other hints and tips would be greatly appreciated! 




 And you shit the food that doesn't have value to you. Har har 




 Yes, I think the middle path is the best path. Where you invest wisely, but also realize that food and cheer in the present is also important, if possible :) 




 *Hoarded* gold can't. That's one thing you can take away from the quote. Unused gold/money has only potential value. The value is realized when it is used/unhoarded. 




 I'm planning on hiking from Geneva down to Nice in late August/September..Will our travels intersect? 




 Contacted Customer Service and they said they would fix it within 48 hours. 




 Forget the fucking tree. If you were falling down and there wasn't anybody around, would you make a sound?

What if all the people you loved were around you? Would you make a sound then?

I haven't and I wouldn't. 




 Hmm...I think I agree with you.

The study says this too, though:

 Westerners with a Christian background also became more tolerant after being exposed to Buddhist concepts, though only among those with a predisposition for valuing the welfare of all people and an aversion towards authoritarianism

I wonder what they mean by by that...that only those with a predisposition for valuing the welfare of all people had their prejudices reduces? 




 That's because in the inverted method, you start with the plunger already in a bit, so you fill in less water :)

In the straight side, you can fill water from the filter all the way to the top. 




 I disagree, but this is not the place for this discussion :) 




 This doesn't really show that one is more true than the other: Buddhist concepts reduce prejudice, or that the people who choose buddhism are less prejudiced already. 

On other hand: in India, Buddhism rose as a response to the caste system, i.e. to reduce prejudice that was at the time, extremely inherent to Hinduism.  




 Nice video, thanks! 




 Android has excellent reddit apps -- Reddit Sync, Reddit news for example. 




 This really resonates with me, thanks! I'm no longer young either, and it's time I let my mind focus on the experience of taking the shot rather than the lens I'm looking through :) 




 DEITY is well... the Department of Electronics and Information TechnologY (acc to deity.gov.in) 




 When I was in grad school, I had no money and my brother gifted me a D40. I loved that thing and took thousands of pictures over 5 years.

Now I'm a little better off financially and am looking for a camera...I thought having more options would lead to a much better choice, but I've now bought and returned/resold the following cameras (and corresponding lenses at times):

EPL3 - NEX6 - D5300 - D7000

I haven't felt the same magic or freedom I felt with the D40. In fact, I'm beginning to feel like I'm setting myself up for disappointment in always looking for a better camera, but on the other hand, every camera feels like I'm settling.

Do any of you feel the same about your gear? Any advice?

EDIT: Thanks for all your responses, guys. Getting out there and shooting is the important part. I get that, but I really have to train myself not to think of the gear. It was easy when I couldn't afford better when it was forced upon me that I couldn't have better gear. Photography really is an emotional thing for me, and I really want it to stay that way :) 




 I use Rhombus. It's not bad. 




 Sent my story across. Thanks for doing this (even if you don't get to mine)! 




 Congratulations on an amazing transformation. Your will power and mental strength is really inspiring 




 I think there's an India Coffee House in Bangalore too...somewhere near MG road.

I can give you directions to the shop where my dad buys his coffee...maybe you'll like it:

Go to Gandhi Bazaar (Uber if you don't know how to get there) and ask someone for directions to "Srinivas Coffee Roasters". You can walk there from wherever you get off the cab. It's just like I described -- small place with one guy. It really doesn't look anything like anything you would find in Forum mall. I just looked for it and there certainly wasn't a website. You might encounter broken english :) While there, eat the masala dosa at Vidhyarthi Bhavan -- it's awesome. Actually...eat the spicy masala dosa there and then have a cup of coffee! I do that at least once on every trip back home. Sorry...got a bit carried away!

Also buy the Indian coffee filter and learn to use it if you don't know how already. Have it Indian style w/ hot/steamed milk (but no/less sugar) and see how you like it :) 

If you want, you can PM me, and I'll give you more details!
 




 There are lots of shops that sell beans. India has a very strong coffee culture, but it's not well advertised like here, and the culture (as it existed before) is very different. The shops are really small (source: I'm from Bangalore). The shops aren't fancy, or anything. They're just a guy and lots of beans and big burr grinder if you want them ground. My dad was telling me that when he was a kid, they would buy green coffee beans, go get them roasted at a roaster and then come back home and grind them by hand at home. 

The fact that Indian coffee is milk and sugar doesn't make it automatically bad. In my house in India, the stuff we get out of our coffee filter is so thick that you have to add milk. The milk is part of the flavor, and not there to hide it. It's just a different way of making coffee. Plus we don't add sugar at home. It's also drunk in small amounts at once, but lots of times. If you visit south Indian homes, you'll see that the first thing they offer you is coffee. Conversations happen over coffee in every house. 

I use an Aeropress and Hario mill and Stumptown at home here in Seattle, but when I visit home, I really don't feel like I'm having inferior coffee when I drink the super-strong 4 oz cups of filtered freshly ground coffee and milk.

What India does not have is a strong CAFE culture. The cafes (so far) have really bad coffee, that I can agree. Cafe Coffee Day, Costa Coffee...all of them sucked when I tried them. 

Plus, they're all aping the espresso-latte trend instead of showing off India's own culture. This is not in itself a bad thing. I do hope Starbucks helps Indian cafes bring up their latte game.

EDIT: I just realized -- North India is, indeed like you say, predominantly tea country. I'm from the South, so results may vary. 




 Oops, I think you're right!  




 For the drummers out there, this seems to be in 5/3 (5/6?) in parts of the song and the solo. Cool stuff! 









 You were The Stranger  




 Doesn't this paper assume that there _is_ in fact, condemnation of the Zors' treatment of the Aree?

It seems the moral "consistency" becomes subjective. If you condemn the treatment and are still non-vegan, you are being inconsistent

If you don't condemn the treatment (food chain, tastes good, law of land, mighty wins) and you're non vegan, consistency is maintained.


 









 So, I had a friend staying over with me, and he left me a very small amount of weed...and I, having never rolled my own joint, have no idea how to start.

How do I? Is there a nice peaceful online guide I can read for this?

 




 Needed to hear this today...thanks! 




 Article is wrong. I bought a sim-free iPhone 6 and have had 4G LTE on AT T without any issue, out of the box 




 Man, he's awesome.

Also, I miss my mom :( 









 Walking -- climbing works too (I have spikes, ice axe, crampons). I guess I could snowshoe if that's a good thing to do around there as well!

The only restriction is that I'll be alone and don't have much experience with Winter Camping in the backcountry, in snow. 




 I randomly booked a flight to Reno for the first weekend of Feb, and want to go backpacking. I land Saturday morning and leave Monday morning...

Does anyone have suggestions for some short and beautiful (15-20 miles total) backpacking trips that I could do. Loops would be awesome, but out-and-back works too!

 









 Go out and play!  




 Thanks!

I'll edit the profile to be a bit more descriptive about my travels! 




 Thanks! 

Also, good point about the pics...I'm looking for more pics with my pretty face as I write this! 




 Thanks! 

After your comment, I spent half an hour looking for more pictures, but I can't find ANY recent ones that have my face in them...Time to dig out the old backup hard drive! 




 Yeah...Doesn't help that none of my friends are single :)

Well, what can I do..I'll just keep at it, and maybe my winning smile will win someone over! 









 There's actually a few things to consider:

1. Timeline: Most companies that release "crippled" products do so because of deadlines and timelines, not because of increased customer satisfaction along the way.
2. Competition: I think this is an extremely important factor, especially in cars. If a company releases a detuned/undertuned car, a different company will release a better performing car for the same price. Car 1 will be reviewed badly, and sell badly. 

On the other hand, if companies *could* get away with it, they absolutely would. Intel comes to mind, as mentioned in some of the other comments

Edit: Ethics aren't important at all. An ethical company tries to make customers happy WHILE maximizing profits AND staying ahead of the competition in at least one factor of their product/design 




 Three months ago, I went into a bad spiral of I don't know...sadness. I couldn't work (I told my manager I had "personal problems", thankfully he understood).

I thought I'd clawed my way out of it.

Today, I went on a date. The date actually went well. 

But...I came back home and cried. Me...a 31 year old male. I don't know why I'm crying.

The scariest thing is that I thought I had close friends. Then I thought of who I could talk to right now about the fact that I'm dying here, and there was no one. Not family, not friends.

I've gone into a shell after the last few months and I can't come out. I don't know what to do. I'm lost... 




 Actually no. moms implies multiple moms. Mom's could mean possession or Mom is, depending on context.

The rules that apply to the word 'it' do not extend beyond it. 









 I think he's talking about Attentive Display, which is the thing that's supposed to keep the screen awake when you're looking at it. That feature is certainly broken -- my screen keeps turning off as I'm reading stuff on it 




 Wow.. No way in hell I could have done that. May you have many more years with this superpower that usually so favors the young  




 Lol..yeah that I can agree with! No sleep and death after sounds more achievable than waking up  




 How old are you? At 31, there's no way I'm drinking till 3 AM and waking up to run at 6 




 The first line has six  
The second line, also six

 Drag files here or just start typing. Imagine those poor files, being dragged everywhere, against their will.

But then, it isnt really against their will, is it?

People are rioting in Missouri and here I sit on my bed in the bedroom me a sort of conservative Indian guy on the bed in the bedroom sort of high and sort of drunk and that couchsurfing lady is in the living room just about five minutes away from snoring and weve just seen Guardians of the Galaxy and people are rioting in Missouri and a sort of innocent kid died and a sort of guilty cop now is free except hes sort of not a cop any more but all the punctuations gone away but the feelings stay and I feel sort of sad for all the kids that die but Im so far way that I dont really understand and there I can see the punctuation coming back.

Heartbreak doesnt make a sound, though Im sure there have been poems written about it. Maybe its the sound of silence shattering in slow motion. Is the sound of my heart breaking here louder than the sound of glass and guns and riots and rage in Missouri? Is my sorrow greater than their anger? It is not greater, but I cant help that it is a shallow pond that is getting me wet, as many roaring waterfalls plummet with the force of a million voices elsewhere.

I wish all the grammar and all the structure would leave, not needed by either me the writer or you the reader, and we would communicate with pure meaning. Who knows what is lost between my mind and the keys and and all the electricity and your screen and your eyes and your brain. Do we really know each other?

I think I know the sound that heartbreak makes. Every heart makes a different sound. Even the same heart sounds different at different times. Sometimes its a glass of whiskey, shattering against the wall. Sometimes its a fist punching a wall again and again and again and again till the sound is softened by swelling. Sometimes, its the silence of tears. Sometimes its the joy of freedom. There is no certainty and certainly no consistency. 

People are shooting at police. Police are shooting at people. Police are people. How does it get to this? 

My day today wasnt bad. My head is aching a bit. Its a bit heavy and Im high and low. High and low. I was laughing at the movie, now Im saddened by Missouri. And Israel. And immigration. I wish everyone found peace, you know. Not the peace of war and peace. But the peace of a light heart. The peace of a satisfactory silence. The peace of a broken heart hopefully picking up its own pieces and patching itself back together. Everyone should be at peace.

I remember Kalalau. I remember those people living there on the beach. They were at peace. But their peace was born of ignorance. Could peace come with knowledge? Could there be peace in misery? 

The silence fills my ears and I can feel my eyes closing. I yawn bigly. Ill be asleep soon, while the world burns in a hundred thousand places. While fifty thousand people have bad sex and fifty thousand people have good sex, and fifty thousand people sleep in their bed with no one to hug.

I think you find what you look for in the world. Forrest Gump, he had it wrong. You get the chocolates you pick out, and the chocolates you pick from that big box of life chocolates, it isnt chosen by you. Your choice is but the interface to a million little events and books and scoldings and experiences that lift your arms, open your fingers, reach for that chocolate that is either joy or sorrow or anger or lust or sloth or video games or mountains or god or God or NoGod or MaybeGod or love or hate or regret or joy and it all those things in the past and present that guide you into the future where you become one or not or die or live or do something or nothing but even nothing is something. Maybe its because Im high that the full-stop runs away from me and my thoughts have to run really hard to catch up but because theyre running and stumbling, nothing is clear and everything is a mess of words on the page like the villains head after its smashed in with a hammer.

Except, I dont know my thoughts and I dont know what a smashed-in head looks like. Except in the movies.

Guardians of the Galaxy: Good movie.
Sad news is sad, but there is hope.
Some people will live and every one will die.

Good night. 




 With evernote there's also the Food app which automatically finds recipes in your notes and presents them nicely when it can 









 It goes away if you reboot when you see the problem, or before you connect to the car BT.

Sucks, though that that's necessary. Hopefully next SW update will fix it 




 I've had this issue for a while. I've tried lots of things including reconnecting the phone, etc.

The only reliable way that works is to reboot the phone every time it happens. Then it works fine, till after 2 or 3 more times, it goes bad again :(

But at least you can reboot your phone every morning and have realiable audio 




 Avial, a band from the south of India has Indian sounding metal(ish) songs. I love this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik9qHKCr8Rc (I don't think they're a band any more)... 




 Yes, yes I'm having this issue too!

It goes away temporarily if I restart my phone.

It went away more permanently when I deleted the car bluetooth from my phone, deleted phone from the car, restarted both phone and car, and reconnected bluetooth. All was fine for 3 days and then yesterday night, it was back!

 




 I really like the Nokia Here app, better than GMaps in fact, except for two things:

1. No biking directions, which is okay, because I can bike where i can walk
2. No Google Now integration. This is the thing that breaks it for me. My most common use case for maps is talking to my phone and telling it to navigate to home, or a restaurant. I wish Google gave us the option/API to use Here Maps as the default. 




 Stone Gardens! It's mainly a rock climbing/bouldering gym, but they have a free weights section with nothing more than the basics: squat rack, free weights and lots of plates :)  




 There's lots of things over the last five years that have led to this. Not any single thing, but many tiny hammers chipping away at my skin and bone till nothing of any importance remains. I don't use a throwaway, so I won't go into too much detail...but like the comment above says, I just hope I find enough energy to continue hanging in there..  




 Thanks for your kind words...Let's see where my life goes...I really hope I have the courage to stand up. 




 I'm just tired. Today, as I was driving my car, I was by the lake and just wanted to drive in it. I have no clue why I didn't. Maybe I'm a coward.

There are people who love me, I don't know why. Maybe because they've never seen me at my lowest, or even low. 

Suicide sounds so peaceful, for me at least. And if there's one thing I'm certain of, it's that it's only my pain that I'm feeling now. But even as I'm thinking of killing myself, I know I won't do it. I just like to dwell for a bit in the thought of a final peace.

I can go rest my face on the grill to distract myself, or cut off one finger. But I won't do that either, and I don't know why. Maybe I don't want my family to go through all that drama. Maybe I don't want to disappoint them. But then, am I really giving them joy if it's all a lie and I curl up into my blanket and cry the night away as soon as I turn around?

I don't know. I read the posts on here a lot. You guys are brave, both the ones that find a reason to live on and the ones that don't. I feel like a coward...just hanging on to a rope of nothing because I don't know to do anything else. 




 Not OP, but on occasion, I write code for robotics applications...and bam, trig! 




 Ah i see why you're saying... My bad. They should be thinking about plating in my opinion, but unlike vocabulary, I have no real knowledge here and I'll take your word for it :-)  




 That's not the usual context for the word "afterthought". It usually indicates something thought about after whatever you were doing was done. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/afterthought  




 You fought the good fight...Good luck with all the things.  




 I just received mine and it's just a joy to hold. The wood (mine's the teak finish) feels awesome, the aluminum frame feels awesome, the size is awesome....

Moto Voice is okay. It's kind of slow at times, but overall understands me just as well as the baristas as Starbucks when they try to write down my name.

I thought I about be excited about Moto Voice, but the best feature of the phone is Active Display. I just keep waving my hands over the phone, marveling at how it lights up telling me what's new.

Lovely phone. 




 Yeah, it was great fun overall. Because we got to hike on the rim, we got the canyonlands-type views along with the slot views :) 




 I went there with friends last weekend, and it was a great trip. The canyons in Utah are a completely different experience from my usual mountain+lake hikes here in WA 









 It sucked me right in. 




 30 year old in same boat. No nice things. No anchors in life. Sinking, floating aimlessly...I have no clue what's going on any more, and I'm tired. 




 Have you heard anything by Sigur Ros? They have a lot of epic sounding ambient stuff, though it is with vocals. On the other hand, it's Icelandic (?), so it's as good as instrumental for practical purposes :-) listen to their album kveikur.. It's one of my favourite albums!  




 Yup, me too :( 




 Oh no...Didn't know about that! 




 It's 9 miles Round Trip, and about 3000 ft gain, I think. So it's hard or easy depending on what those numbers mean to you :) We started climbing by about 8:30 and were down by 3 including a break for lunch and a nap at the top. 

Here's a blog post I wrote about it: https://pritamps.exposure.co/hidden-lake-lookout  




 It's in the North Cascades, just outside the national park. In fact, the border of the national park is where this pic was taken from. We had a dog with us, so we didn't go into the park. 

There's a bunch of these lookouts and they all offer magnificent views.

Don't believe WTA when they say these are Summer destinations. Snowshoeing up these trails is a lot of fun! 









 Plus the LG G3 16 GB version has only 2 GB of RAM 




 With the paper filter, you can plunge out the grounds and the filter together over a trash can.. With metal, you have to remove the filter by hand, then plunge out the grounds, then rinse. 

Not that that's not easy, it's just harder than for the paper 




 I was glissading about 3 weeks back and injured my lower back. So now, for the last two weeks, my back has been hurting a decent amount. Not too much - I can walk and talk and work and be happy without having to cry out loud.

However, I decided to take some time off running to rest while I recover. The problem is, it's been 3 weeks and I still haven't recovered fully...and I really want to get back to running! All the trails must be so lonely without me.

I'm 30 now, and my body isn't what it used to be at 22 :) So I ask, is it okay to run with lower back pain, or should I wait it out a bit more?
 




 If you're on AT T, Towelroot works. Look for towelroot on Google, go the website, download and install the apk and you're done! If not, IORoot is rumored to work, but I'm on AT T, so I didn't need to explore other options

After that, go to the Xposed website, download and install the APk

Then go to the Google play store, look for G3 tweaks, and install the APK :) 




 This is an emotional rant more than anything else...feel free to ignore.

I saw all these reviews saying the NEX-6 took amazing photos...and maybe it does. 

I came to the NEX-6 from a Nikon D40 with an Olympus E-PL3 in between. I was determined to reduce the size of my camera bag.

At first the E-PL3 just felt wrong, and now the NEX-6 just feels wrong. The Nikon D40 somehow just felt...real. 

Maybe it was the viewfinder? The NEX-6 has an EVF, but it's not really much better than seeing it on the LCD. Maybe I'm just technologically backward? 

I don't know...Maybe I just need time to get used to it? Anyone else have a similar experience?

EDIT: Wow..I was off reddit for a day...thanks for all the responses! I'll give it more time and if it doesn't work, with upgrade to a nice DSLR....maybe even go all the way to full frame..My backpacking bag won't be happy, but maybe I will!

 









 Reading all the replies has convinced me against the Mr. Coffee, thanks!!

Is there a good grinder below $150 that can handle the french press? 




 Wow...thanks! I'm convinced about the Encore now..but what would your pick be (in a similar price range) for a French Press?

What about the Aeropress? 




 I've been using a Hario Mill Skerton + Aeropress for the last year, and I've been quite happy with it. However, I drink only a cup or two a day at home.

My dad is visiting and he drinks a lot of coffee. I bought a larger french press for him, and now I'm thinking of getting an electric burr grinder so he doesn't have to grind by hand all the time. 

What's the difference between a $35 one (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004T6EJS0) and the Baratza Encore that I see recommended on here over and over. Is the Encore really worth all that much more, assuming I won't be using either for anything other than the Aeropress or the french press?

EDIT: You guys convinced me thoroughly. I bought the Encore. My dad will probably be mad to see me spending $130 on "just a thing to grind coffee"...but Oh well...the taste of the coffee better be worth it :) 




 Porcupine Tree - Start of Something Beautiful 




 I had a similar experience one day...After much investigation, I discovered that my router was losing connection every few seconds, which was causing the G3 to keep disconnecting and reconnecting to the network. Thus the battery drain. 

I only noticed because my laptop kept disconnecting as well.. 




 Your wish has already come true! Well.. Has been approved to come true, I mean. http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_26061420/golden-gate-bridge-board-approves-funding-suicide-barrier 









 Solid advice about listening to my body. I think I'm pretty good at it, and I've seen what happens if you don't! 




 Thanks! 




 Hey! I live in Seattle, but both my trail runs have been in Oregon (Monument Peak and Peterson Ridge). The Columbia Gorge is one of my favorite places in the world!

I'm in agreement with all of your rules, except for keeping tabs on my shoes. But only because I've never done that. I will keep all of this in mind. We have very similar running philosophies :)

The 50 I'm looking at is not really an event. It's the West Rim trail in Zion National Park. 48 miles, 7000 ft gain, lots of fun :)

Good luck at Mt. Hood!
 




 What's a good training program to get to 50 miles? My most recent trail run was a 20 mile trail run (Peterson ridge).

I have very good endurance (well...relative to my peers, I guess). The 20 miles didn't tire me too badly, but my feet were hurting quite a bit. So, I guess I should have increased distance in a more planned manner, rather than jumping into it like I did. 

What kind of training program should I follow? The simpler, the better...I like my runs to be peaceful. Pain is okay, but I don't want to be constantly monitoring my heart rate and so on...Ideally, the program would get me to 50 miles in 9-10 months of enjoyably torturous running, even if a bit inefficiently.
