 I often play online chess with a friend of mine who recently started playing. We play these long correspondence games where one gets ample time to move a piece. 

I don't know how but suddenly after 2 weeks the guy has improved tremendously. We are in the middle of a game right now and I'm probably going to lose my light squared bishop and it's just going to be very hard to recover from this.

Chess is the only thing I was good at. I've been playing for years and got a 1700-ish rating on some online websites and even won some online tournaments.

Man it's gonna hurt if I lose
