The music video won a Grammy in 2007. Well deserved if you ask me. 




 I was at a dinner party with a few friends one time. It was me, my best friend, a few couples, the hosts family (husband, wife, three kids) and the grand parents. At the end of the day everyone was leaving and the kids were all begging to sleep over at their grandparents house. For whatever reason the dad said no, I forget why. Anyhow, everyone goes home and sleeps off the light beer and appetizers.

The next day I got a call for the host. It was an 'invitation' for his father in law's funeral, the very same one that I had seen at the party last night. Apparently, when the grandparents had gotten home last night there was someone already hiding inside their house waiting for them. He waited until they were asleep to sneak up and stab the grandfather to death. His wife was also stabbed, but she managed to make it outside where a neighbor saw her and was able to help her.

She was taken to the hospital where she was treated for minor injures. While she was there the same man that had broken into their house came strolling through the hospitals front door. In his trial the grandma claimed that as he walked by he stared at her and smiled.

Apparently he had somehow cut himself during the attack, and a neighbor who had no idea what was going on insisted they take him to the hospital. The very hospital the wife of the man he had just murdered was at. Creepy as shit.

He was arrested shortly after being treated, thank god.

**TL;DR A man hid in my friends parent's house and waited for them to go to sleep to murder them. The wife escaped and was taken to the hospital. The attacker soon showed up at the same hospital.**

EDIT: I got one more I wasn't planning on using but decided to anyways.

One week my best friends parents went out of town. It was the first time they ever out of town without him so it was kind of a big deal. We were pretty young, so we didn't throw a party or anything, but we did have an awesome unsupervised sleep over at his house.

I quickly realized I greatly under estimated how scary this would be. His family was rich and he had a **huge** house. Seeing such a big dark empty house was pretty frightening for both of us. We spent most of the night playing video games in the basement.

The next morning when I was getting ready to leave I kept looking for my laptop. I had brought it over to watch a movie we ended up never seeing, but now I couldn't find it. I told my friend I swore I left it on the kitchen table upstairs with the rest of my stuff. My friend decided this was the perfect opportunity to show off a little and show me the security camera terminal his dad had shown him how to use before leaving. I knew he just wanted to brag a little bit that he could even do that, but I figured it might actually help find where I had gone with it. Plus, although I'll never admit it, a security camera terminal sounded really cool and I kinda wanted to see it.

Although there was no camera in his kitchen, the camera nearest clearly showed that I had gone into the room with it (as well as with the rest of my stuff) and came out without it. Naturally, we both assumed the worst. Ghosts. We kept watching though because I insisted that if *I* didn't move it, it must have been *him* that did it some other time that night.

At about two in the morning a man walked past the camera. A very big man with a bat. He came into the shot, looked around for a moment, and then walked into the kitchen. Naturally, we freaked the fuck out. We checked the other cameras for that time. After piecing together the video like a puzzle, we saw that he walked up to every door in the house and tried to open it. The screen door on the side was unlocked. He walked in, and did a preliminary tour of the house. Then he left out the door for a moment, and returned minutes later without the bat. This time he grabbed some stuff from my friend's dad's office, a computer and my laptop. He also took some jewelry, but we didn't find out until later as that was of camera. After collecting his prize, he closed the side door, and left. If my computer hadn't been gone, I would have never known he was there.

I couldn't sleep for weeks after this. A man broke in and robbed the place while I was in the house. That can be pretty god damn traumatic for a kid.

A few years later the police got the guy. I never got my computer back though.

**TL;DR Slept over at my friends house while his parents were away, house was robbed while we were sleeping inside.** 




 Psh, ones that visit Pluto.

 Shrimp fried rice! Totally! 




 How would you even know if something was bad if you never knew just how good it could be? 




 If you don't like Five Guys, you don't like burgers. Simple as that. Five Guys is the most basic that burgers can get.

 Good god that's demoralizing. 




 Now we just need to figure out where to get the fine China... 




 Honestly, the only British versions I think arebetter is Top Gear and the singing shows. I've never seen the singing shows, but I have to hope they're at least slightly better. 




 Wait she doesn't come out?! Well hell, I wish someone had told me that 47 minutes ago...

 The throw at the end is the best part.

 nbsp;
 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Raspberry Snapple has always been my favorite. Not just my favorite iced tea, my favorite drink. No matter where I am, I always have a Raspberry Snapple in hand. My friends constantly make fun of me for it. Raspberry iced tea runs through your veins! they say, One of these days the Snapple factory might need to donate blood for you! I dont mind, I sit back and chuckle with them. Its all in good fun.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;My friends have become so accustomed to my habit that they will often have a six pack of Snapple sitting in their fridge waiting for me. My best friend Tom usually has two or three in his. Sometimes Ill catch his girlfriend sneaking one out too. One of us! One of us! I tease. Nicole and I have become good friends over the years. I spend a lot of time hanging out at their apartment. Or at least I used to.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Tom and I had a falling out a few weeks ago. He works as a doctor, a plastic surgeon. He makes good money doing it, not too long ago he moved his office to a brand new building downtown. Its amazing, exotic fish in a tropical tank, expensive paintings on the wall, attractive receptionist behind the desk, the whole nine.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He even offered to get me a job there. Nothing too glamorous, mostly ordering and stocking all of the medicines he needed. I was a little skeptical at first, but then he told me the salary. When can I start? I said eagerly.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The job was pretty easy. He really only needed botox and aesthetics, as well as the occasional new surgical tool. Once I got the hang of the order forms it was a breeze. My day would consist of, asking what Tom he needed, waiting for the 9 AM delivery guy to drop off the new medicines and filling out the forms for the next day, After that all I had was time to kill. Sometimes I would watch the fish swim around, sometimes I would surf the internet on my phone, sometimes I would talk to Allison (the receptionist). It was probably the best job Ive ever had.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;One morning I walked in to find Tom waiting for me. He was tapping his foot impatiently as he stood with his arms crossed. What the hell is this? he said handing me a small medicine bottle.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I read the label. Tretinoin I said rather puzzled, Why?

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Well? Where is the rest of it?

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The rest of it?

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Yes, the rest of it! He said angrily, I have an operation in three hours and this is all that was in the medicine storage. Where is the rest of the Tretinoin?!

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Confused, I grabbed the order form off of my desk. Tretinoin, Tretinoin, Tretinoin-ah, there it is. Tretinoin, eight bottles

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Eight bottles? No, no, no this was the only one in there. You didnt order eight bottles, you ordered one! His voice was getting louder and louder. Allison politely pretended not to notice from behind her desk. "I can't operate if I don't have the first three days of their prescription ready for them! I'm going to have to cancel, and it's on you!"

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I shook my head, There must have been some mistake, I ordered eight. Look, it says it right here on the form. Eight. If we only got one it must be on manufacturing or shippings end. I didnt-

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I dont want to hear excuses, this is *your* job! If you cant handle it Ill have to find someone who can!

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I was shocked. I couldnt believe he would shout at me like that. We were friends, best friends. Was it even that important? We had lenty of medicines could be substituted for trentinoin, I should know I ordered them myself. No, this was ridiculous, I didnt have to take this from him. Not from Tom. Fuck this I said quietly as I turned and grabbed my coat. I thought you were a better friend than that

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He wasnt impressed. Dont bother coming back tomorrow! he shouted as I walked out the door, Dont bother coming back ever!

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I didnt hear from him in the following weeks. Although I still hung out with Nicole, I always made sure he wasnt around when I was. He must have known what was going on as he saw the number of Snapple bottles in their fridge dwindle, but he never made an effort to reach out or say anything. I didnt mind. At some level it was satisfying to know he was aware I was spending time at his house but couldnt say anything about it.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Me and Nicole ended up spending more and more time together now that my time was freed up not hanging out with Tom. We stopped spending time at their apartment so much, I think he was finally getting frustrated enough to say something about it to her. Instead we went to the movies, to the mall, even to my shitty apartment sometimes. It became a routine. Every time she finished work we would meet up in a bar at the mall for a drink, then go window shopping past all the trending stores, then go back to my place. It was great. It was like I had lost a best friend, but immediately found a new one.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;At least I thought she was a friend. She started texting me things that suggest she might have wanted to be a bit more than that. I didnt dwell on it too much, she had been in a committed relationship for a few years now after all. Every now and then though it made me stop and think. The hints slowly became more frequent and more serious. Things like, Why am I even with Tom? I spend more time u anyways lol and I wish I was single when I met you. I always responded with something light like, lol whatever you say or something. What else could I say?

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;One day Nicole stopped at my house unannounced and bluntly laid out. She said she didnt want to just be friends, she wanted us to be together. At first I was completely against it. Tom is my friend I would say, I cant do that to him

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;She kind of laughed at that. You think youre friends? You havent seen him in months, we sneak around so you two never have to make contact and youre worried about his feelings?!

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;That made me think. Were still best friends? Were we still even friends? No, how could we be? I havent seen him in months...he didnt even care enough to say anything when I was in his fucking house. Why should I let some asshole who fired his best friend decided how I live my life? No, fuck that. Its *my* life.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Me and Nicole started dating soon after that. She said a few times that she was going to end it with Tom if things between us got serious, but she wanted to make sure it was the real thing before burning any bridges. I understood that I guess. I mean it was sleazy, but I get it.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Over time I started feeling guilty about it. She tried to comfort me saying things like, Weve been drifting apart for a while now but it didnt help. I decided to end things, or at least put them on hold until they figured out how things were going to be between  in the long term. Blah, I hate this drama shit.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I went by their apartment to end things for now. I knocked on the door. No answer. I knocked again. Nothing. Eventually I heard the locks turn and the door slowly opened. Nicole was standing there in tears. Behind her glass plates laid broken across the floor and a mirror rested smashed in against the wall. He found out she said in between tears, he read my texts

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I tried to comfort her. I suggested that we take a break to give her and Tom a chance to figure things out, but she didnt want me to leave. She didnt feel safe around him anymore. She told me that after he had found out he went crazy and started breaking and throwing things. He tried to go after Nicole too, but she locked herself in the bathroom. He said he was going to kill you she said still crying He said he was going to find you, and he was going to kill you I brushed it off but she felt she needed to warn me. Nicole looked me dead in the eyes, he said hes going to find you, and hes going to kill you

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Eventually I calmed her down and drove her to her brothers house. I wasnt sure if I should to to the police or what. I decided I should just go home for now. Let things simmer down a little.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;As soon as I walked in the front door my phone started ringing. Tom the screen read. I was a little shocked, this was the first I was hearing from him in what seemed like forever. I answered.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Tom, listen I-

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Did you take the Snapple?! his shout cut me off mid sentence.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I was lost. The Snapple?...

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;In the fridge-my fridge-the raspberry Snapple, did you take it? Did you drink it?

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I looked down at the half empty body of iced tea in my other hand. ...Yeah, I did. Im sorry, I thought you knew I was at your apartment

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;There was a brief pause. SHIT! he yelled at the top of his lungs, Shit, Im sorry. Im so sorry man, Im so sorry. I was caught up...I'm so sorry...

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;What the hell is going on, dude?...

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Im so sorry, Im so so sorry he kept saying over and over.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Whats going on! What are you sorry about??

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He was silent for a moment, it seemed like he was almost on the edge of holding back tears the tea I...I put a bottle of Botulinum in the raspberry iced tea

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;That didnt mean anything to me. Botulinum was something I was used to ordering for him, I think he used it in botox operations. His desperation scared me though. I panicked and ran over to my computer so fast that I tripped over my own feet. I quickly Googled botulinum Snapple. Nothing. botulinum iced tea? Nope. I tried just botulinum. Woah. I clicked the first link and read. As I read a chill raced down my spine. I completely involuntarily dropped the phone. This couldnt be happening I read it again, and again. ***The Botulinum toxin causes Botulism, a fatal condition if not treated immediately upon ingestion. It involves muscle paralysis, eventually leading to the paralysis of the respiratory system and, consequently, death in a matter of hours*** For the first time I realized I couldnt feel my feet. I looked down at them. My right foot was awkwardly bent to the side, it actually looked rather painful, but I couldnt feel it. A horrifying realization rushed over me as I tried to move my foot and watched as...as nothing happened. It didnt budge an inch.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;No no no this couldnt be happening! I tried to get up, nothing moved. My knees wouldnt move! I couldnt get out of the chair! I tried again. I tried so hard to get just twitch out of my leg, anything, but it wouldn't move. No! I twisted my stomach and reached for the phone I had dropped on the floor. It was too far, I couldnt get it! Shit! No! **REACH FOR IT!** I tried again. With every bit of energy I had I reached and stretched as far as I could. Nothing. I didnt even brush the top of it.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I sat there completely defeated. I didnt want to believe this was happening. There must be something, some way to stop it! I yelled at the top of my lungs over and over again, hoping someone would hear me. Eventually I stopped myself. What was my endgame if they heard me? What could they do to help me? I was too far gone by now. There is no saving me.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;There is no experience in this world more terrifying than watching yourself die. Watching what's left of the life inside you slowly wither away and being utterly helpless to stop it. I can feel the numbness slowly moving up my body. Its passing my stomach as I type. I think its even beginning at the end of my fingertips. Soon Ill have nothing. What happens then? Will my heart stop beating when it gets to my chest? Will I sit here unable to stop watching my computer until it all ends? This could very well be the last sight Ill ever see.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The suspense is very literally killing me. I have never known a horror as terrible as this. Im considering finishing the bottle of raspberry iced tea sitting on the table next to me. Will it end this faster? Will it finish the job, and put an end to the doubts I still have? I have so many questions I dont want to have answered, and yet I know Ill have those answers in a few short hours. Or will it be minutes? Or days? I wish I didnt have to find out, but I know I will.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Only time will tell. 




 MIL? 




 Aren't puppies fun and playful and adorable too though? 




 I don't necessarily disagree, but aren't cats fluffy too? 




 I never realized it would have to be 'Big Hero 6 2'. You'd think the marketing department would have changed that. 




 Baymax V. Baymax 2016?! 




 Nailed it. 




 I know this is long, but I think it's worth it.

Me and a friend used to do some yard work at a neighbors house for some extra money. A family of four owned the house, mom, dad, young son, younger daughter. Each time we went there we would ring the doorbell so they could start the clock and ring it again when we left so they could stop it. One time we got there and the dad opened the door wearing boxers and a tee shirt. He was out of breath too... We joked about it, but he was a pretty weird guy so we didn't think much about it.

When we left we rang the door again and exactly like the last time he answers the door. Half naked and catching his breath. He hadn't paid us this week and promised to, so he went into another room to get his wallet. Suddenly there was a scream, then another and the wife, who had apparently just gotten home, ran past the door shouting. Then the babysitter ran by. Unlike the husband or the wife, she wasn't wearing anything. Suddenly it all made sense, the babysitters car was always there even when the kids weren't.

A very intense argument began and somehow made its way onto the front porch. We would have turned and ran, but the dad insisted we "hold on just a sec" so he could pay us. He kept saying things to and about us in attempt to take himself out of the spotlight. To make it even weirder, the dad and babysitter didn't feel inclined to put on more clothes before stepping out onto the porch. She was actually very attractive, but even sixteen year old me just wanted to get out of there. Out of anger, the mom stepped back inside, closed the door and locked it. Still naked, the two others shouted and pounded on the door for her to open it. A few neighbors heard. I know at least one called the cops but I didn't stay long enough for them to arrive. We waited there at the edge of the porch for ten minutes while the dad repeated over and over again "just let me get my wallet so I can pay the boys". She never did, and to this day neither of us have gone back for the $30 they still owe us.

**TL;DR Wife caught husband cheating with babysitter while me and a friend were at their house, they got locked out on the front porch next to us without their clothes.** 




 Yeah but...for Father's Day... 




 That we will win! 




 You're right, I hate when things like the laws of physics change. Then I have to get used to a whole new laws of physics. 




 What an...inappropriate Father's Day gift... 




 Just going up to someones front door just to see if they want to hang out. Not like a random person, a good friend's house though. Apparently that's 'weird' now. I was a little sad to learn that. 




 It feels weird that there used to be 'smoking' and 'non smoking' sections in restaurants. That sounds like something my grandparents would say when talking about the olden days. 




 Give myself a hell of a salary, retire on pay day, let the next guy actually run things. 




 Could have been worse. Could have been a bunch of chili powder. 




 No way... 




 But, but, but pants are not required for a sexual encounter... Opportunity squandered! 




 The only reason I doubt this a little is because even in such a perfect situation to say that, I would **never** say that to the parent of someone I just broke up with. That just...rude? Excessively rude? Something like that. Also that term hasn't been around for all that long. That would make you still pretty young, right? 




 Personally, I hate Family Guy but love BoJack. I would give it more of a chance if I were you. I mean every animated cartoon has an amount of stupid, even South Park, but that doesn't necessarily make it good or bad. 




 Probably not. I mean I'm not going to judge you either way, I don't know the details or anything. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Ijr621tM 




 Certainly not a law, in fact there's about a 50-50 chance that's *not* what would happen. Everything is theoretical, we can't prove any of it. Or at least not yet. 




 Spegetification! 




 I'm in college but I'm not studying physics. Just a course I took, although I do find it more than interesting enough to research in my spare time. 




 Is...is that what you got from it? 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgNDao7m41M 




 Every time I talk about rogue black holes, that is the biggest obstacle. [To put it to bed though] (https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS536US536 ion=1 espv=2 ie=UTF-8#q=rogue%20black%20holes). 




 I would even understand it a month into a relationship. And I assume you even knew her before that too. It's more people who just meet and decide this must be what love is. It really cheapens the term. 




 Ah, thanks I'm not so familiar with the term. 




 The opposite, if I was single I would never be able to come up with such a complete list... 




 It's more when people who are fat are now content with it because being curvey has become popular. They act like they have a perfect figure because they qualify as 'curvey'. I've even heard a rather fat lady once tell an extremely fit person they should work on getting more curves instead of working on 'silly things like abs'. I really dislike that kind of attitude. It gives those that don't care about their health a reason to care even less, and discourages those who do from staying healthy. I'm not saying I am that fit a person myself, but I would never say anything like, "you would look better if you stopped going to the gym and got some more curves". 




 Sorry, what I meant is it would *be* longer but not *seem* longer. 




 Actually they already made that one. It's called 'Teeth'. 




 You've never seen BoJack Horseman. 




 Ohh, even better. 




 When people comment on comments commenting about people commenting on their own comments. 




 For a second I thought you got it in the Amazon. I didn't question it, that seemed to make sense. 




 When people comment on their own comments 




 Taken...and also Taken 2. 




 "Fish in a Barrel" working title 




 Whaaaaat? Mr. Peanutbutter and BoJack Horseman in the same restaurant? Is this a crossover episode? 




 But he's the best god damn not an animator the world has ever seen. 




 You are a liar, final answer. 




 Don't look down. 




 Anddd I'll be sleeping with the lights on tonight. 




 Yu-Gi-Oh cards. The best part about it was no one knew how to play the game, we just had an irrational want for the cards. 




 What does that have to do with expecting the wold to change on my behalf? 




 That makes sense I guess, I live in an unreasonably cold area. 




 * Jaws

* Die Hard

* The Young and the Restless

* Holes

* How I Met Your Mother (my personal favorite)

* Get Hard

* VHS

* Sex Drive

* Two and a Half Men

* The Big Lebowski

* Men in Black

andddd

* Game of Thrones

EDIT: Oops, thought it was TV shows too. 




 Although better for the car, that's a little impractical. You can't give the car three minutes to catch up every time you start the engine. 




 "I love you" is thrown around way too loosely these days. I've seen college/high school kids saying that almost immediately after they start dating. Excuse me, you're in love? You didn't even know them a week ago... 




 /r/space is awesome. There are also a lot of Youtube videos that can be very interesting regarding space or black holes. Search something like 'space time' or 'black holes' and I'm sure you'll find something. [This one] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgNDao7m41M) is one of my favorites, very insightful.

If you're really committed there are also plenty of books on the subject. Stephen Hawking is probably one of the best authors out there right now, he goes on much further than just black holes though.

Even TV shows like Nova sometimes talk about black holes. Although I would agree Googleing it probably isn't the best method, there are still plenty of sources out there. Good luck! 




 The world isn't going to change? Why did you think I expected anything to change? The question asked what I found annoying, I answered. 




 Good god, that would be a truly horrifying person.  




 I guess it just depends on how often it's said. I'd say the maximum limit to a phrase like that is about once per conversation before it really becomes noticeable. 




 * Pants that go up past the belly button

* Constantly checking phone, even in the middle of conversations

* When people who are fat act like they are in their physical prime because they have 'curves'

* 'Emo' hair, makeup and clothing styles. That trend is more than dead.

* Must take a picture of every. Single. Thing.

* Talking about how fat/ugly they are, regardless of weather or not it's true

* Highlighter hair colors

* Choker necklaces. Not exactly sure if that's what it's called.

* Too many piercings
 
* Fake nails exceeding an inch in length

* Rather take pictures/videos of concerts and sporting events than enjoying them

* Thinking they're a good singer, and singing often because of it

* 'Too cool for this' attitude

* Asking me to like their Instagram or retweet them

* Half of texting vocabulary made of up emojis

* Constant gossip

* Diet exclusively made up of Nutella, coffee and trendy foods like quinoa. Only talk about those things.

* Being mad but not being direct about it, and then getting madder that no one noticed

* Way too much makeup

* Getting mad when I respond to a text with less than three words

* Dramatically over dressing for minor occasions

* "I'm a vegetarian but I eat fish because they're not animals" actual quote

* Hating every other girl that is remotely attractive

* Thinking it's okay to tell everyone everything about everyone else

* Constant talking about male celebrity crushes, getting mad when a guy references a female

* Tattoos that cover as much as the entire neck

* Holding grudges for way too long

* Entitlement

* Rant about gender equality, get mad when I ask if we should split the bill then (just an example)

* Expectations that life is like a romantic comedy

* Overly tan, skin cancer is in this year

* Thinking their unique sense of style is working (Such as wearing overalls)

* Micro thin eyebrows

* Overusing terms like 'bae', 'I can't even', 'the struggle' and 'fleek'

* Worshiping Starbucks and 'Dunkin'

* Not getting a job, coasting off others


EDIT: Obviously this doesn't apply to anywhere near everyone, many probably apply to both genders too.

EDIT 2: I'm not referring to any one person, just things I notice seem to be becoming slightly common in the social world today.

EDIT 3: Reworded the 'curvey' thing. That is more what I meant. 




 A classic. 




 I love that one. 




 I've kind of seen it too many times for it to still be funny to me, but [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F9jXYOH2c0) used to be mine. 




 Bojack Horseman.

I really love how the jokes continue on through the show instead of just being around for one episode (Hollywoo, Halloween store in July store, etc.). I hate when they do that in sitcoms. 




 A very good joke, but far far from the best. 




 No, but it's easier to understand worded that way. 




 Well, the singularity, the center of the black hole, theoretically is a point of infinite gravity. It's called that because there is simply no other way to explain it, although it's all theoretical.

Since the singularity would by definition have to be the same on every black hole, they wouldn't have to have the same gravitational pull all together, but they would be the same at the center. That's because the singularity is as small and as dense as it gets, there is no difference from black hole to black hole.

The size varies because although the singularity of black holes are all the same, the mass is not. And the gravitational pull does not extend at the same strength across the universe. It is lowered exponentially until there is almost no pull at all. Thats why not everything would be sucked into one black hole. 




 Any other pictures? 




 ...where the fuck did they test this? 




 Sadly, no. Although that would make an awesome science fiction movie. The only way to make a black hole would be to crush an object below its Schwarzschild radius. The ratio between normal size and Schwartzchild radius is so ridiculously big that us humans could never hope to reach it (not yet anyways). Just as an example, the Schwarzchild radius for an object the size of Earth would be about as large as a peanut. It would be impossible for us to crush anything that small.

But assuming we could make a black hole, we would have to feed it things until it obtained enough mass to become larger than the oncoming black hole. That again is a problem. We could of course throw in the planets of the solar system, but that probably wouldn't be enough. The rouge black hole has probably swallowed up much more than a few planets, maybe even a few stars, it's likely much much larger than any other black hole we could conceivably make.

If well placed enough however, we could probably use a black hole with enough mass to divert an oncoming black hole from it's collision course. The gravitational pull would at least alter its path slightly, wich could be enough.

All in all though, no that's not really an option. 




 Yeah sorry, I did this on my phone. 




 Yes, that's the one. I know where it is, no one ever seems to use it though. Even when I get letters from the government they always have the sloppy right orientation on. 




 That thing on Microsoft Word where the lines fill out the whole page instead of just stopping at a jagged edge on the side of paper. It looks so much more professional, but no one knows to do it. 




 I [just went on for about twenty minutes about black holes and the universe] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3dsllj/what_is_the_weirdestscariest_most/ct8g29u), and I could go on for hours more. In my humble opinion, it is by far the most interesting topic of discussion out there, or at least within the top five. 




 Black holes are crazy. Basically if you can crush something small enough, it can create a point if infinite gravity and density. Not only that, but it could potentially create a bend in time space so dramatic that it connects two parts of the universe millions of light years away. Even the laws of physics are at the mercy of black holes. A black hole could slow time itself!

There are even theories that black holes contain stars, planets-even galaxies-within them. When something is sucked into a black hole, like say a star, it is compressed into the black holes center where it will stay forever. Eventually more stars get sucked in adding to the collection and creating a star system, and even a galaxy! And what would happen if one of those stars went supernova? It could potentially create another black hole, with another galaxy inside of it, with another black hole within that! Theoretically, we could be living in a black hole inside of another black hole inside of another.

Some theories are far more sinister though. Some believe that getting close enough to a black hole will start a process called 'spegitification'. Spegetification is the stretching of an object so far that eventually every atom that made up the object will be layed out in a single file line.

As you are standing right now, or probably sitting, your feet are experiencing stronger gravity than your head because it is closer to the source of the gravity (the central Earth). The same thing happens in a black hole but to a much much larger scale. So much larger in fact that if you were to go into a black hole feet first, you would be stretched out with your feet stretching further than your head because they are under more gravitational strain. Spaghettification. Eventually you would be stretched out soooo far that what used to be your body would now be that single file line of atoms. In theory, they would keep spreading apart until they reached the singularity, the center of the black hole.

And then there are rogue black holes (yes that's how you spell it, no it's not the color. I think the Bitish spelling is different, that can cause a little confusion). Rogue black holes are black holes that don't have a fixed position and instead wanted aimlessly thought the galaxy. It's pretty scary when you think about it, there is literally nothing that could stop a rogue back hole and it could swallow you up in a matter of seconds (although it would seem considerably longer than that for the person being sucked in). At any moment, the Earth-hell, the entire solar system-could be destroyed by a black hole moving by at near the speed of light. It's unlikely anyone would even see it coming, although the methods for finding rouge black holes are getting better they're far from perfect. At every moment, the threat of spetification could be looming around the corner, but we can never know for sure.

Honestly though, I'm not sure I'd even want to know if one was coming towards us. There is literally nothing that can be done to stop it or get out of the way, might as well cross our fingers and go on with the day.

The science of how black holes could connect different parts of the universe is also fascinating. Space time is a physics and mathematical term combing both space and time in a single continuum (sometimes referred to as the 'space-time continuum'). It can be visualized as a flat plane, think of it as a table cloth with the ends held up to keep it straight and flat. If there was nothing in the universe, this is what space time would look like. Gravity bends time space though. Things like planets, stars and black holes cause bends in space time. Imagine that there was a few marbled dropped on the table cloth. The marbles represent planets, or stars, or anything holding mass and therefore gravity. Each marble bends down a small portion of the table cloth surrounding it, creating a crater. The areas of the craters slope that are bent the most have the strongest gravity, while the areas that are relatively flat have less. If the marbles move, their 'gravitational craters' move with them. Space time is filled with bends throught it.

Many believe space time isn't *just* flat though. They think it is more the shape of a cylinder. Imagine that two ends of the table cloth have now been joined creating a circle. The marbles are still bending the cloth inwards, but it is shaped more like an 'O' now. To represent areas of ridiculously high gravity (such as black holes) we can't use marbles, they're simply too small. Instead, lets drop a bowling ball right on top of the table cloth amidst all the other marbles. The bowling ball is so heavy that instead of just bending the table cloth a little, it stretches it all the way down until it is touching the cloth on the other side of the circle. It is so strong that it connected two points extremely far away from one another directly through the middle. Black holes extreme gravity could very well connect points in our universe the same way.

That means that if we could somehow survive the journey into a black hole, and then escape out the other side, we could come out trillions upon millions of light years away on the other side of the universe. This is what is known as a wormhole, or an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

Absolutely insane stuff, and I've really just scratched the surface here on the basics of black holes. There is so much more I didn't go on about, so much more than that that's miles over my head and so much more than that we don't even know yet.

**TL;DR Black holes are fucking insane.**

EDIT: Just realized my phone changed everything from 'space time' to 'time space'. I'll try to fix that. 




 Gracias! 




 No, I understand how Reddit works. It's a good fact, it deserves be higher up in the comments. 




 Can someone please reverse this so it looks like he's moon walking? 




 Dildo of god. Oh my. 




 Jesus, what an unfortunate farmer. 




 I think the Dutch are just trying to pull a fast one. "This is called a carrot, it used to be blue. You're just going to have to trust me on that one." 




 For science. 




 Highway 11 just didn't have the same ring. 




 Holy shit, this should be higher up. 




 Sorry, but I'm gonna one up your Aztec fact a little bit. Did you know, that Oxford University is older than the Aztec civilization? Crazy.

 I'd love to go on a boat trip one day and see a Great White float on by, belly side up. 




 I like facts like this. Oxford University is older than the Aztecs. How crazy is that? 




 "Oh yeah, I uh, grew a beard and aged ten years and lost my accent. Adult onset puberty." 




 It says 'gold shall be their shrouds'. The prophecy seems to go in order, I think Tomen died before she's killed. Maybe that's even why she's crying when she's killed. 




 In my humble opinion, Mergery is the 'younger and more beautiful'. Cersi was the queen until she came along, now she has to give up everything to her. Even her precious Tomen.

Her children's hair are 'gold'. I don't think it means literal crowns, unless Marcella is somehow made a queen. Apparently they'll all die to, probably before her considering how the prophecy seems to go in order. Watch your back, Tomen...

It says she'll die when her tears have drowned her. Tears for the death of someone perhaps? Such as Marcella? Or Tomen? Maybe both. It also says '*the* valonqar', not '*your* valonqar'. That makes it seem like it really isn't one of her brothers. It would also be difficult for them to be the killer considering Jamie doesn't have hand*s* and Tyrion is half a world away. Who does that leave? Sandor obviously, not sure if that's realistic or not. I'm not really sure who else. Could be a new character of course, but I can't imagine her being killed by someone just introduced.

The entire 'valonqar' part wasn't in the prophecy during the flashback in the TV show though. They might do things very differently. 




 In the books maybe, but they've kind of burned that bridge in the show so I have my doubts. They could of course make a change, but I couldn't imagine such a huge difference. GRRM is an executive producer after all.

Brienne don't even really fit the prophecy. She's not more beautiful than Cersi, they've definitely established that through both the books and the show. I'm not sure which of them is younger though, they seem to be about the same age? Either way, it doesn't fit for her.
