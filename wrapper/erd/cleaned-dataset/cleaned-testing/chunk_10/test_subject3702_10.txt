 I have medical bills from last year that amount to roughly $1000 dollars. I was an idiot, and let them get into collections. 

The same collection agency is dealing with three different amounts, and I received the letters about four months ago. 

I'm now cleaning my credit up, and ran TransUnion and Equifax credit reports, which are not reporting the accounts at all.

**Question:**

I would like to pay up to half of this right now, and pay the rest off in installments. Should I call up the collections agency and just do it, or should I try to receive some sort of writing first that it won't be reported on my credit report?

Thanks! 




 Maybe mashed potatoes?  




 Building [the next gen crusher](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCMasterRace/wiki/builds#wiki_the_next-gen_crusher). 

How well will this deal with photoshop, or say, CAD modeling software?

edit, I'm getting the better cpu suggested in the build 




 A lot of my default subs are real communities that have serious discussions.  




 Haha obvious,  thanks man 




 What is a method I can use to avoid accidentally pushing db credentials into a repo? 

Other than the obvious "just don't add the file. " 




 wow! I've never seen anything like this. 




 Problem with me is those things very rarely work in my dreams 




 Wow 




 I was at... the home--my home. 




 I found the southerner 




 Is this ok? 




 That's just your crew drinking and fucking around while the captain's away 




 Ups once delivered my tv to the wrong address two streets down from me. I called, and everyone was just all shoulders... luckily, the guy who got it found me and I grabbed it from him. 




 Im going to save your comment, and give you gold if this is ever revealed to be a thing. That will show these down voters 




 Why would we be laughing about that? 




 Ice cream break 









 Would this technically be a butcher block desk? 




 Honestly, native americans are the victims of cultural genocide and unspeakable violence. They still get shit on today. The issue is a sensitive one, and I don't really mind if they get upset every once in a while. 




 That sounds like I would make them for people, eat them all and then throw up. 




 How big are the pngs? 




 I can't remember what episode this is 




 The meatloaf?  




 Lot's of hikes 




 The only reason to label GMOs is so that the anti-GMO movement can then say "If they aren't dangerous then why do they have to be labeled?"  

Source for that? 

 




 "Oooh, those are a pretty rare variety but deadly poisonous.... mind if I come grab them for pictures / spore prints?" 




  The author is changing the license of the code, however, so soon, it will be.

He can re-release the code under a new license, but it doesn't change the fact that the old repo was forked and modified with the old license.

~~Ir~~regardless, he does have some pirated ROMs on his site, so the morality of this guy is questionable.

ok, fair. But the roms are being distributed to demonstrate the functionality of the emulator, not being claimed as the authors original work. He shouldn't have them up there, but using possesion of GBA roms as a metric for morality may be a bit too sensitive when dealing with an emulator.  




 He ~~ripped off this guy....~~ forked this repo: https://github.com/taisel/IodineGBA

FTFY
The credit's in the git history. This is the cool thing about public code and something that should be encouraged.
 




 you're just reaping karma gold with this face huh? 




 anythin we should prepare for or do?

Yeah, prepare to spend a lot of money securing that .com when you finally get in touch with the owner
 




 Now you got me sayin it 




 I'm on the smaller side.

I slapped this girls ass in the bar in front of her jacked 6'4" boyfriend and started talking shit, got kicked out of the bar after almost getting the shit beat out of me. 

Then I proceeded to black out and talk shit to all of my friends and stayed up until eight in the morning.
 




 I want to know what made them! 




 apparently the /s/ tag is now required in /r/politics 




 It's pointless to try and sway people who hold /u/gonnaupvote3's type of anecdotally informed belief in this way.  

They've simply seen it, and therefore believe it to be true.

I wholeheartly agree with you, but I also sympathize with gonnaupvote3. 




 ok..

You're reading a technical manual for information, not entertainment. This is the same reason why journalists tend to refrain from using whimsical prose to describe events.

If you'd like to read story books to learn how to operate the linux kernal, fine, but that's not the best way to get the info you need. 




 More than a bonus podcast! I'm talking straight bonus. I feel like I'm on a friggan game show right now. 




 I n-n-need more then that! I deserve c-c-c-cash for my time, effort and money. I want my name on the masthead. 




 ...and no government will ever again be viewed as legitimate.

What?

 




  Was it vital for the survival of human beings? If not, I'd rather we be in the dark for certain subjects... 

The problem with that line of reasoning is that the nature of knowledge and information doesn't work linearly. Knowing something new about one thing can open up breakthroughs in unrelated fields. 

It's unfortunate, but if we abstained from everything we didn't need we'd be living extremely spartan lifestyles. Cheap clothes, cheap food, cheap energy all come at the expense of unsavory consequences.  




 You think artists receive a wage of $0/hr? 




  Was the knowledge gained really worth the tremendous emotional and physical suffering of the rats involved?

yes. 




 sure thing here's the link: 




 Another thing that really grinds my gears is re styling the scroll bar. It seems like it has become more popular recently and I hate it. 




 Seconded for auto prefixer 




 The library?

Honestly, what are you looking for? Go to wikipedia, read his overview, see what interests you about him and then go to the library and take some books out. Rinse and repeat.  




   Parasola conopilus

Don't think so, gills aren't the right color. Lbm's are quite difficult to identify. Spore print's would help, but even then, who knows. There's lot's and lot's and lot's of mushrooms that look like this.

edit: all of the colors are a little off, and the cap shape doesn't look quite right either. 




 I'd love to see some as well 




 Then shut the fuck up about it 




 This is nice work 




 Wheres the link so I can throw my money at you? 




 I find it really useful to use two screens. 

I do work on the go alot, but I prefer mouse / keyboard / extra screen 




 a) what is it that you don't like about bootstrap?

b) what would you suggest as an alternative?  




 I use grunt sometimes, but it you have any jetbrains software, you run a task to automatically compile your files. 

Sometimes it takes a bit to detect changes so I have it linked to a ctrl-alt-/

Edit: I would be surprised if other ides didn't have the same feature 




 To be honest, from what you've said it sounds like your boss wants you to take potential employees out after interviewing them, not for you to drink again.

If that's part of your job, so be it. Take them out, pay for their tab and drink coca cola. No big deal, you got this! 




 Funny, you left out gitmo and the Iraq war and the drone program and the financial crises, the growing concern that leaders are being blatantly bought by millionaires, a troubling stance towards whistle blowers, incredible racial disparity, the NSA spying program....

But no, we have gay marriage and weed. We're just *fine*.  




 here's a basic breakdown:

Step 1:

use input type='file' multiple to get the users files into the browser

Step 2:

send these files to the server

Step 3:

on the server, use a library like ffmpeg via php, to convert and echo said files.

Step 4:

When the server sends the response, make the file available for the user to download.

That should help get you going 




 Thanks! I was literally juat going home to start doing this. 




 ha! got a project TouchMe, for touch events 









 Thanks for the inspiration, been feeling a bit lost lately. 




 Well, if they're concatenating and minifying, then they don't really need to be worrying about those comments showing up 




 That's what I was going for :)  




 Good to know! I was more thinking along the lines of, "I just woke up and need a coffee before anything else." 




 Ive been mainly using duolingo, and have read some helpful articles... but what I came up with is this:

 So... taupe is bad? 




 Incorrect 




 Cool man, I'm going to play around with this tomorrow.  









 I would also be interested in this 




 Yeah, it's unfortunate they weren't staring at scrolling screens of green on black text.  




 It would actually be amazing seeing as I feel that I'm conscious. I wouldn't put it passed a human brain to create sub consciousness in duress, those pesky motherfuckers. 

Sorry, im drunk. 




 This is what comforts me, honestly.  




 Just imagine all the bravery those reporters could bask in.

 Apply to many, many places for a barbacking position. Use friends, friends of friends, family and acquaintances as references and potential leads.

In that position, you'll be working with bartenders. You will be a bitch, doing menial tasks and learning what happens behind a bar. Work hard. Take every shift offered to you. Cover shifts. Be prepared to take criticism. Learn the drinks and the side work of the bar.

 In time, you'll start blurring the lines between barback and bartender. Then you'll be able to pick up -- here and there -- bartending shifts. Using that experience, you'll either A) be able to weasel your way into a bartending shift at the place you're at or B) start applying with actual bartending experience to other bars.

Good luck man. 




 I would go out on a limb and say this:.

They got the TBS deal. It's not hard to imagine, given TBS' s track record for realising potential. J   A have an excellent portfolio. The Twitter campaign was planned to garner support, awareness and viewers for the upcoming show. 

They split with college humor because they might be a) already shooting episodes,  or b) because of conflict of interest / a very busy schedule of writing and shooting the upcoming show. 

That's my guess anyway... 




 Just an example, this was 15 years ago. 




 I've always had to setup an iptables firewall with rackspace stuff

Me too. But that's like one of my first steps when dealing with a new server regardless... why anybody wouldnt care to look at it boggles my mind.

 




 An honest question:

It's awesome that facebook would pay for and appreciates this kind of exploit reporting... but is what he did technically illegal? 

I know somebody from highschool who found major exploits in the school's network, documented  and then reported them to IT to try to get a job for his senior year.

The IT department head (It was made up of like two/three people) responded by reporting him to the police and he ended up beibg expelled. I'm not really sure what happened to him legally,  but I know it kind of fucked his life up for a bit. 




 Looks like someone tried to take this thread into dvote heaven. But I refuse
