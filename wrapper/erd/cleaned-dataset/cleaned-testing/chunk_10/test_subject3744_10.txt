 It has been since he was caught being a cheater. Created the account right after his original was banned. He also has said that he also comments with another anonymous account. 




 If you look close you can see it says police. So hopefully the angels actually paid Anaheim pd to actually fly that thing there. Flying a heli is not cheap.

 Got me also, i knew 2 letter usernames weren't allowed. When i hovered over and gave me a userpage, i couldn't believe it. 



















 ... congrats 




 thanks 




 I am sad to admit that i have upvoted you to many times over the last 2 years that doesn't involve the cj. 




 If you want to keep dancing, we can.

 




 not as much as you do 




 wut

edit - congrats on submitting bs to /r/AdviceAnimals without it even getting upvoted. 




 At least chino can afford their own PD instead of depending on the sheriff's dept. 




 You have the sheriffs dept. 




 Only drunks that hang out in dive bars will get this. 




 Too rich to afford your own PD. Can afford to have a juvenile camp though.

 That actually sounds pretty good. That toe probably smells like bleu cheese.
 




 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 




 I'm going to start on the reposting train, but i don't have time for this shit. 




 Right? This was an addict going to last resorts trying to feed their lifestyle. I've been there and know you will burn bridges trying to supply your habit other than ~~than~~ trying to provide for it.

This isn't best of, this is just sad.

edit - a word 




 Someone mention this should be in /r/woahdude instead of /r/funny, so you post here. thanks funny guy. 




 /r/mildlyinteresting  




 What is funny about this? Because of the title? More interesting than funny. 




 Seriously, wtf is a combo?

 After it was dug out, i would love to pour hydrogen peroxide in it. 




 Not to mention the fresno police car in the picture which is suppose to be Baton Rouge. Should have had paid more attention. 




 agreed, will delete it. 




 Will put some research into it.
 




 Only way to do it. 




 Thanks for adding context and history. Not cool they would publish their personal info. 




 i feel sorry for how fat that dog is, walk him please. 









 You both have been going at it for an hour... 




 Not at all impressed. 














 Ya he is correct, i'm guessing he doesn't live in the area. 




 Either you don't live in SoCal, or i should have added the /s tag. 









 Nothing, drive like you normally would.

edit - /s for the non SoCal people 














 The video i provided is from a news source. Shows the scene more than anything the guy actually says or does. Shows other people trying to help the teenagers while he is walking around the scene. 









 ~~Been trying to find the video, but no luck.~~

 thanks buzzedaldrin for the birds and the bees talk.

Can you explain on how to do this? 




 Some of you take that flying spaghetti shit too seriously

I'd ban him for that shitty title.

edit - this guy is just a shitty troll. Look through his history. 




 but crazy sex is best sex. 




 Sucks you are being downvoted. Assholes in /r/gaming think that everyone in the world plays games and sits on gaben's lap all day.

I didn't know the name of the game was in the title either. 




 Loved Pepsi when i was a kid, then i grew up was mature enough for Coke. 




 i never win anything...

 Yea, after about an hour i tried to back on twitter and find the article to post in the comments but couldn't find the tweet. Believe there was a stolen car involved.

 You must not drive on the freeways very often.

 I hope not. 




 Just over 24k barrels of oil? I'm not great at math, someone correct me if i am wrong. 




 Doing a google search on the name "Dato Osepaishvili" is very interesting. Found a twitter that was created in 2011 and could be the same as OP pic that is 4 years younger. Accounts linked to a facebook and twitter accounts are all from Georgia. Not very legit solid evidence that it isn't a fake identity that has been created and has been used for other things to promote fake likes and followers.



Edit - /u/mario0318 did an extra click that i didn't and [found something even better to debunk this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3dj26p/this_was_my_friend_dato_osepaishvili_he_died/ct60lyb)

 Was on the Sum Fun outta Dana wharf, pretty much was a private charter for a bunch of coworkers. 




 [Moon Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Machines) is another good watch if i might add.

 Never thought of that...

 At least you can have a first floor boat dock.

 




 Warm waters and live bait on top. Largest was a 51 pound yellow fin. 









 Do you do drugs? If you do, you would understand and not be so naive. Addiction is stronger than anything you could ever imagine. 




 If his bio dad actually cared enough about his kid, he wouldn't be a junkie in the first place.

 I hate wireless... PLEASE DON'T EVER BUY A WIRELESS ALARM SYSTEM. Spend the money and have a pro install a wired system. It will cost you money upfront, but you will make that money back in not having to buy batteries and having the peace of mind of not having to worry about it not working. 




 How is this /r/funny?

 Before entering the meeting with Beshear, Davis, with his wife of 23 years, Christy Davis, at his side, said he was willing to go to jail for his religious beliefs.

"If that's what it takes to express freedom of religion, I'm willing to do this," the clerk said.

So freedom of religion gives you the right to deny others their rights? 




 Better than Root 




 There is still plenty of people here that have no problem with pao and trying to make reddit rid of hate. 




 It is to stop people accidently brigrading. I will open an NP link and forget that it is one and try to upvote/downvote.
