If you want to switch back and forth, then IFTTT is a great solution for syncing saved articles. 




 Even if you're not able to transfer your saved articles from Feedly, you should give Inoreader a go. It's a very powerful reader with great features (much better than Feedly) ;). 




 Since this is a subreddit about Inoreader, maybe you should ask for help from Feedly or from their communities :).

My only solution for transferring saved items from Feedly to Inoreader is IFTTT. But this will work only for new items, not for previous saved ones. 














 First things first. Are you sure that you are able to export your "saved for later" articles? [Feedly needs a Pro subscription for that](http://i.imgur.com/AwCd3XM.jpg). 




 No problems here. But i've been having some problems with IFTTT recently, which they fixed after i reported them (mainly with Trello and Reddit).

You may need to delete that recipe and recreate it. If it doesn't work, please contact [Inoreader devs](http://forum.inoreader.com/) or send a tweet with the problem and the recipe ID to @ifttt and @inoreader. 

































































































































 Inoreader has a free plan. IFTTT is free. You can go ahead and try it for yourself :).

 To hide read articles, you just click on the "**All Articles**" button.

After clicking, the button's text will have the number of unread articles and you will be presented only with unread items.
