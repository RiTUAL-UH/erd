 Revs 




 Solo revs is an experience in and of itself. Just do it.  




 Try to think of your diagnosis like diabetes. :) I find it easier to brush of peoples ignorance that way, because I wouldn't feel ashamed or upset if someone tried to make me feel bad for having a broken leg or something, just laugh at them for being an idiot. At the end of the day, your brain is an organ and can get unwell just like any other.  




 Thank you for that. I think the hardest thing has been, after having the diagnosis explained to me and what the symptoms are, I had this epiphany-type moment where I went back through all the shit that has gone on in my life and, with the revelation of this disorder, realizing that every single episode was caused by me and me alone. My entire understanding of my past and my friendships has been completely flipped, and it makes me sick to think of the things I have done to people because I thought they deserved it, how I pushed people away and yet expected them to come back and save me. I'm so deathly afraid of the road ahead. Its bittersweet in a sense because for once in my entire life I have an understanding of the chaos that is inside me, but at the moment I can't see it changing or getting better (even though, logically, I know it can).  




 I'm a 20 y/o guy that has struggled with episodes of rage and depression my entire life. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder in 2011 and have been treated on the basis of that up until today. A few days ago I had my first major depressive/suicidal episode in almost two years and was admitted into a psych hospital after much convincing by my doctor (I could feel myself sliding into a depression so I decided to see my doctor to get a referral to a psychiatrist). After speaking with some of the doctors here they are confident that I have BPD. I never even knew what it was. After reading up on the symptoms, every single thing is applicable to me. Intense mood swings, splitting, issues in my friendships and relationships, impulsive behaviour, self destructiveness and suicidal thoughts etc etc.

I've been reading up on BPD and I feel so so much worse. I always knew there was something really wrong with me, and I thought it was Bipolar - I WISH it was bipolar because at least it is treatable. It feels like a death sentence. I cannot see myself ever finding love or holding down a meaningful friendship (my life is a long, smoking trail of destroyed and failed attempts to connect with people). I feel lost and upset and confused. I don't want this. Where do I go from here. FUCK 




 The issue is that she is practically living here and not paying rent. I do like her as a person, I consider her a friend, which is why the situation is so difficult/complicated because I want to resolve this without damaging the friendship. I probably should have mentioned this before but she was actually living here before I moved in. She was living here with Roommate B until they split up, and I took over her lease. They got back together after a few weeks which is when this all started. Putting her on the lease is not an option because of a few things: 

- the apartment is simply not big enough for four people (its a two bedroom apartment, and the room that I'm in isn't really a room)

- there is only three car spaces, with no other place to park within 3km (she currently parks in the visitor spot when she comes over, which residents aren't allowed to do)

- the landlord would not allow her back on the lease anyway, because she handled leaving so poorly last time (she basically just up and left and stopped paying rent - it was just luck that I happened to be moving around the same time because I was looking at other places before Roommate A asked me to take over the lease)

Having said all that though, myself and roommate A have discussed asking her to pay a share of the utilities bill when it comes next, based on her being here literally every weekend and having showers etc.  




 That's the plan at the moment - I'm just finding it difficult because my options for getting away from the situation are minimal. I've moved interstate to a city where I have no friends or family. Short of eating out   sitting in coffee shops all day   night I have no other options, I can't go anywhere else except home. And most of these issues arise when I'm trying to sleep.  




 As stated in the OP, I have brought all of these issues up with both himself and the girlfriend on numerous occasions, and have always gone about it in a polite way and going in with a plan on what I wanted to say and a solution to fix the issue. The problem is fixed for a while, then it slowly seeps back in over a week or so before going right back to how it was previously.  




 **TL;DR: My roommate has no respect for myself or the apartment, does not make any effort to keep the place clean or contribute to the household in any way. His girlfriend (who does not live with us) is at the apartment basically 24/7 and does not respect the boundaries of myself or my other roommate. There is constant drama in the household, and despite my best efforts to tame the situation, nothing is changing   it is affecting my work performance and getting me down. I don't know where to go from here.**

I moved in with roommate A   roommate B in February earlier this year. Roommate A is great - I have been friends with him for over 10 years, and we rarely have issues between us when it comes to household stuff. Roommate B (who I had only briefly met once before I moved in) on the other hand is an absolute fucking nightmare.

So there are a lot of issues at play here; Roommate B

- Never cleans up/washes his dirty dishes

- Never contributes to shared items for the household (toilet paper, cleaning products, milk etc.)

- Refuses to do stuff like take out the rubbish

- Has a total disregard for the noise he makes when other people are sleeping (Roommate A   myself both do shift work and generally work weekends while Roommate B has a day job and weekends off, so he's always having people over for drinks   coming home late over the weekend and just being as loud as fucking possible)

These are some of the more minor grievances, which are sort of a non-issue because of one thing - his girlfriend. His girlfriend will come over and do his washing, cleaning, cooking, and buy his share of the household shared items (they have a joint bank account). But that is also sort of the problem here.

Roommate B's girlfriend is over every single day of the week - from the afternoon when Roommate B finishes work (~4pm) until late into the evening (10-11pm). As I said above, she'll come over   cook for him, clean up all his mess, do his washing and pack his lunch for work the next day. The only reason she goes home is because myself and Roommate A sat down with them and told them that she could no longer sleep in the apartment during the week (after she had slept there for 15 consecutive days). So now it just feels like they're taking the piss. She is here as often as possible during the week without actually sleeping over, so technically following the agreement we had made with them, and then she is here from Friday afternoon until late Sunday evening (and will stay on a Monday if there is a public holiday because 'its apart of the weekend'). 

This has been a constant issue in the household, and myself and Roommate A are constantly having to address it. The issue isn't really so much even the time she spends here, its the way she treats the apartment   the fact that she comes here not as a guest, but to basically live in the apartment (without paying rent or utilities). Further issues with Roommate B's girlfriend;

- She does her washing here (not all of it, but regularly enough to be noticed)

- She has her own bath towel   hook in the bathroom

- She frequently refers to the apartment as 'home' or 'our place'

- She will invite her friends to the apartment without letting any of us know (has brought them over for dinner)

And just yesterday she walked through our front door unannounced, with a friend, while Roommate B was not home (he had given her his key to get in).

So all this stuff is going on on a regular basis, just constantly building up my frustration at the situation and both Roommate B   his girlfriend's total lack of respect for myself and Roommate A, and then on TOP of this, every single weekend (or close enough to not make a difference) they will go out for a drink, come home and have these loud, melodramatic arguments that go on for MINIMUM two hours. This is not just bickering, its huge episodes where she's screaming and crying and threatening to leave him forever. If he hasn't cheated on her, he's spent too much of her money or he's taken drugs again. This is of course followed by them making up and having ridiculously loud sex. I haven't been living here all that long but I have already lost count of the amount of times I have had to go into work with NO sleep because of this shit. 

This honestly sounds like an episode of some stupid TV show and I legitimately feel like I'm trapped in the big brother house. I have voiced my concerns numerous times to the both of them on all of the above issues, and they say all the right stuff and it gets better for about a week, and then quickly descends right back into where it was.

I just want to be able to feel comfortable and safe in my own apartment. I want to be able to sleep   have my roommate respect my space and the apartment. I am on the lease until January and I am at a complete loss of what to do here. 




 Infuse it with apricot and make a Charlie Chaplin. Mmmmm 




 I've actually just been asked to write the cocktail list for my bar, with heavy suggestions on certain alcohol so they can move some old stock. 

45ml fireball cinnamon whiskey, 15ml frangelico, 30ml thickened cream. Shake, strain, awesome. 




 It's also in Australia, where almost everything is significantly more expensive. $20 an hour is really not that much here.  




 Did you not see the part where he tried to use the terminal and it shutdown/locked itself?  




 Nothing like a cheeky nandos after some banter with the lads, ay bruv? 




 Jesus Christ please do not encourage the use of bisexual as a stepping stone to coming out as gay.  




 If the screen turns on, its not bricked. You can just flash it with ODIN.  




 Check out the Melbourne bartender exchange on Facebook. You're not likely to find work here. (Also, there is a shit tonne of places hiring in the cbd and northern suburbs at the moment. Just print out a bunch of resumes and drop them in person) 




 Heavy liquor licensing laws prevent such a place from existing. You will be back on the streets by 4am, so no partying til sunrise unless its in an apartment (or at the casino, but let's not go there). Swingin safari has a pretty cool vibe though (depending on what you're taking - I'm assuming MDMA) but I don't even know if its still open.  




 Melbourne. Its entirely possible to go out Friday night and not stop partying until Monday morning. Look up revolver Melbourne Sunday morning on YouTube.  




 I get what you're saying but its now been two days since it happened and I haven't heard from her. I would have given the benefit of the doubt if she had reached out and apologized for her behavior, given that she was under the influence and no actual harm came of it, but she clearly does not have an issue with her behavior and that says enough for me.  




 100% certain. Only thing I'd taken was the pills (and a handful of drinks) and while I had started to have some auditory hallucinations by the time I got to my apartment, I seriously doubt I hallucinated coherent sentences.  




 Definitely did not help the situation haha.  




 Yeah I guess you're right. I think I'll just stop making the effort to contact her, but if she apologizes on her own I would just let it go (but still never be in a situation with drugs and her again). We were all definitely still under the influence, but she was also lucid enough to know exactly what she was doing.  




 I was the one spending the money on the drugs. Maybe that was it... 




 I'm a guy, and the other two people were another guy and another girl.  




 Haha you got me. "Let's go to revs." Was said more than once. 




 Last Friday night I met up with a friend and a couple of her friends that I had not seen for a few months - after a few drinks we ended up getting our hands on some ecstasy and took a few pills each. These were the strongest ones I'd ever done and I ended up on a completely new level - it was fun and awesome, we basically just hung out at a bar until they closed at 7am. By the time we got outside I had started to come down, and after getting a bite to eat I started having mild hallucinations (likely due to sleep deprivation) and decided to go home. Up until this point the night had gone fantastically, but my friend and the other guy we were with instantly turned nasty as they wanted to keep going (there is a club where I live that is open 24 hours Fri-Mon and is generally filled with people that don't want the good times to end). They started taking advantage of the fact that I was coming down (both physically and mentally) and were trying to scare/guilt me into staying. I have only just moved to town so I didn't really know where we were, and they refused to give me directions to the nearest train station and even actively tried to make me confused/lost - I tried to get my bearings by walking the direction I thought we had come and they followed me, laughed at me and told me I was going the wrong direction. I was becoming extremely upset and just wanted them to leave me alone but kept my cool and did not give them the reaction they wanted - just pretended like that weren't doing it and gave them both hugs and thanked them for a good night when I finally got on a tram home (thanks to my phone).

Why do people do this? I have no issue with going on multiple-day benders but when someone decides they're done, why on earth would you try to make them feel like shit for making that decision? Because I was coming down extremely hard it really rattled me and I ended up in tears on the tram. It has truly affected the way I view this person (after being decent friends with them for 3 years) and I probably won't socialize with her ever again. 




 So many people on this sub misunderstand this. The reason they make those unnecessary modifications isn't because it enhances the experience, its so that when you hand your mum your HTC or Moto device to take a photo, they look at it and go "oh I don't know how to use this, I have a Samsung.". It creates brand loyalty because people go with what's familiar.  




 It explicitly says that it is unlikely to work on modified ROMs (eg cm) 




 The reason this rule usually exists is because some people have tattoos that are distasteful or inappropriate for the workplace, and so instead of having to make a judgement call per tattoo (and thereby inviting the possibility of outrage and drama from an employee that is upset because they have to cover their tattoo but another employee doesn't) they just have a blanket policy.  




 Guess we're all different after all. :) OP did say they were into pubs over clubs though, so that's what I recommended (club Liv is awful). Take it from a 19 year old who goes out quite literally every night.  




 Surfers is tragic compared to the nightlife of almost every other major city in Australia, so don't expect much. That being said, fiddlers green and the avenue are usually pretty enjoyable any night of the week. If you're down for a boogy I'd hit up Bourbon Bar - pretty much the only club in Cavill that's worth the entrance fee. Beer garden is always good fun too.  




 Yes, you can do this by shrinking the existing partition to whatever you desire (the minimum being the amount of data currently on it, so 400gb) using Partition Wizard in windows or gparted (from a live linux disc). You can then create an additional partition to install OS X to. 

Just FYI, it's recommended for beginners to install OS X on two separate hard drives as installing them on the same harddrive can cause issues that may be difficult to solve for someone that has never hackintoshed before. The OS X installer will refuse to install on a drive that does not have a GPT partition table (windows machines typically have MBR) and you will need to patch your installer to allow you to do so. 




 How do you feel about paying taxes?  




 If we're taking this to a realistic level, each month there'd be a performance rating and if you don't reach a certain rating (or have too many customer complaints) your mandatory employment is extended an additional month, until you complete every month with satisfactory effort.  









 Make sure you don't have NO PLS RECOVERY installed.  




 When I was suicidal I used to write letters to the few people I thought I owed an explanation to if I were to actually commit suicide. By the time I finished each letter, the feeling would pass and I would promise myself that I would sleep on it and if I still felt like doing it tomorrow, I would. Each time I would wake up the next day feeling really silly and dumb and continue on. I kept each letter that I wrote in a book. I wrote about 10 in all, and then a day came where I realised there was nobody else I felt I should write a letter to - which means I no longer had something to distract me from the suicidal compulsions I had. I left the letters on my bed and stood outside my parents bedroom door for about an hour, hoping that they would somehow be able to sense that I desperately needed help. They didn't, so I got in my car and drove to a stretch of road that I often travelled to clear my head, which I had never seen any other cars on at night. I closed my eyes and just put my foot down and let go of the wheel, ended up going off the road and rolling a couple of times before crashing into a tree.

What went through my mind? Nothing. Not to take away from what other commenters have posted here, but I have noticed a lot of people are posting about having a rough night and thinking about suicide. When you really make the decision to end your life, you don't think about anything. You have considered every single option and to your (irrational) brain, suicide isn't just the best option, it is the *only* option. An overwhelming sense of calm and clarity overtook me. My mind was blank. 

I walked away from that car with a couple of stitches in my head and back (crawling through the shattered windshield) and a broken finger. To say I was incredibly lucky was an understatement. 

Depression is no joke. If you think someone you know might be struggling, PLEASE do something. The thing that made it the most difficult for me is that I had reached out to people and nobody really took me seriously. My parents wrote off my behaviour changes and general deterioration of my mental state to being a teenager. Please, don't ignore shit like this. Suicide is a fucking horrible thing.  




 I installed it without issue, so I'm not sure what YouHawk's problem is, but I have no idea how to check if it actually deleted afc2. 




 It's viewed by many in the jb scene as insecure.  




 iLex RAT and restore will essentially restore your device without losing your jailbreak (using the restore option). Regardless, while Apple is still signing 8.1 and 8.1.1, just restore to whatever iOS version you want and rejailbreak.  




 Boot into safe mode by holding volume up while booting (disables all tweaks). From there you can either try to uninstall tweaks one by one (you'll have to reboot each time to get out of safe mode and see if the tweak was at fault) or you can make a backup and do a fresh restore.  




 Your best bet is to uninstall any tweaks you've installed in the last 24 hours since you started having issues (you can do this in safe mode). Respringing in safe mode just goes back to safe mode again, which is why your tweaks aren't showing up. You have to reboot, and if you're sill getting a black screen then there is still a problem tweak. Possibly try installing ilex rat while in safe mode and use that to remove all your tweaks.  




 Make a backup through iTunes of the old one and restore that backup on the new one. Done.  




 According to ipsw.me (which is updated every 60 seconds) 8.1 is still being signed.  




 You need to follow a guide, Google around for a bit and read one. At the first Yosemite selection screen, type "-v" without the quotes and hit enter. Your mouse isn't supposed to be responsive at this point, what you're seeing is the bootloader, which only responds to keyboard input.  




 I think I may just be the worst here: Smirnoff vodka, Jim beam, Gordon's gin, cuervo tequila, bundy rum, Johnny red   Bacardi. $8 for a 1oz pour.  




 Niresh has a lot of tweaks and changes to the system compared to a vanilla install (moreso than any other hackintosh) so doing a direct update to 10.10 would be a bad idea and you'd probably lose your working install. Its recommended to do a fresh install to update between major releases anyway. 




 Anyone know if I can take advantage of this deal in Australia? 




 What's your point? 




 I know they have been transparent. I don't actually have any problem with them doing it. My point is, if you do your banking on an operating system that WILL send your bank account login info over the net, you are extremely naive. Not even your bank knows your password. All it takes is a disgruntled Microsoft employee.  




 Why on earth is this guy being downvoted? It's absolutely true. If are using Windows 10 as your main/only OS right now you are retarded.  




 You come back to that area later in the game and you have a new tool to get through.  




 Graphics enabler is a hack to use unsupported graphics cards on osx. Osx supports the HD 7xxx series natively as of mavericks. Leave it off.  




 I think "less intelligent" is a bit of a stretch. Building a pc is an enthusiast/hobbyist thing to do. A person is not "less intelligent" because they choose to channel their time and energy elsewhere.  




 The "charm" you're talking about is called nostalgia, dude. The current gen (and every future gen, likely) still provides that same "charm" for the 10 year old that gets a COD Xbox One bundle for Christmas. 

"It used to be so much better pre console x" aka when you were a kid. What a stupid comment, of course its going to seem better/cooler/more "charming".  




 You can uninstall the motioninjoy software once you've got the drivers up and running and just use better ds3 exclusively. That's what I did and it works like a charm.  




 Why not just exclude connections made to certain IP addresses/websites? How are you catching the data usage in the first place? 




 I think that might be your problem - I'm fairly sure virtualbox requires you have at least 8gb of RAM to host a 64bit OS for performance reasons. Have you tried installing the 32bit version instead? Your computer might handle that better.  




 Are you on the latest version of virtualbox? You have to choose 64bit from the drop down list of OS options. http://imgur.com/uHIzuZk 




 Virtualbox definitely supports 64bit and has for a long time.  




 You can't post a link and text at the same time, just FYI.  




 I think this is more in terms of if it gets taken to court.  




 Its a graphics issue. The GUI is loaded just after that Bluetooth message (the Bluetooth message isn't stopping the boot, your GUI just isn't loading afterwards). Try graphicsenabler=no 




 Omniroms split screen is pretty slick.  




 Try myhack 




 Why on earth would you make a comment like this in the nexus 4 subreddit? 




 That's just luck and coincidence. Osx WILL work on a lot of hardware but just because it has happened to work for your devices does not mean it will work without fail every single time. Still incorrect.  




 This isn't accurate, at all. Certain hardware parts will simply not work with OSX, no matter what modifications are made. If OPs friend has intentions of installing OSX on his PC he should make sure it is as compatible as possible before purchasing it, otherwise he's not going to have a great time.  




 Unlocking the bootloader   rooting makes it significantly easier to perform an unauthorized SIM unlock.  




 Lol, didn't OP post this theme on /g/ and everyone there said it sucked? (Not saying that I was one of them - I think it looks great) 




 At the chameleon bootloader (black background with grey text that has a countdown - this screen appears before the grey apple logo) type in "-v -x" (without the quotes) and hit enter.  




 A somewhat easier solution is to install Niresh in a VM and then create the USB installer through that way (saves you screwing around with partitions and reboots) - and IMO myHack is easier to use and has slightly more features than Unibeast. Great guide though! Also I'm pretty sure everything you put after the -v flag is redundant: -x is safe mode and implements all those flags itself anyway. 




 Given that 8.1 is a free update to 8 I can't see why your 8 key wouldn't work, but I haven't personally tried it myself so I can't say for sure, sorry. 




 Those programs are for updating an existing Windows installation (e.g. Windows 7 - 8), and cannot be used for a clean install. For a clean install, I'd suggest downloading the Windows 8.1 .iso that corresponds to the version you currently have from [here](http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/53564-murphy78-s-Windows-8-1-Server-2012r2-with-Update-MSDN-iso-files), then making a bootable USB installer from it using [rufus](http://rufus.akeo.ie/) and then doing a clean install by booting from the USB (and backing up any important data beforehand). 




 Where would I find USB kexts? I have already searched for motherboard and chipset kexts for my hardware, as well as USB. I know I need something I just don't know what the correct term is. :( 




 I'm having issues getting my Wifi USB adapter to work. I previously installed Mavericks on my PC via Niresh 10.9 and after seeing how well it worked I decided to create a clean install USB and reinstall OSX (Niresh comes with a lot of extra kexts and random apps and I wouldn't really feel comfortable doing anything that requires me to put in a password on it).

The USB adapter I have uses a 8191s Realtek chipset, and on the Niresh installation all I had to do with download the Mac drivers from Realtek's website (used the ML drivers as they were the latest one). No issues there, all up and running perfectly.

Now, with the clean install, after installing the drivers and wireless utility app that comes with them (using the exact same install package that previously worked on 10.9) and then restarting (as per the installation instructions), the Wireless Utility app refuses to start. I open the app and I can see the icon appear briefly in the dock before immediately disappearing again.

Things that I have tried:

* Installing different/older versions of the driver (tried every driver available from realtek)

* Tried modified drivers from macbreaker forums

* Manually installing the kexts that are contained in the installer.pkg

All with multiple reboots - no dice. Still the same issue.

One thing that does stick out to me, on the Niresh install, when viewing USB devices in System Report, it listed the USB as RTL8181S Wi-Fi Adaptor, whereas with the clean 10.9.4 install it is simply listed as Miscellaneous USB device - which makes me think its an issue with a missing or unmodified kext that had already come with Niresh and I have yet to install; only thing is, I have no clue how to figure out what I'm missing. Is it a motherboard issue?

Any pointers would be great! 




 Yeah it will work fine, just did this myself actually. If you install osxfuse and ntfs-3g on OSX you can read/write to the NTFS partition too. I just set up all my libraries on Windows and home folder on Mac to point to that partition, so now I share photos/videos/documents/downloads folders across OSes. Works pretty well. 




 How is this the highest upvoted comment here but it doesn't have a single source to back it up? 




 My friends mum gave her some for a birthday present and she uses them because she doesn't want to make her mother feel bad that she's not using her gift. They're not all bad :( 




 Did you wipe /data and /system before flashing again? If it booted the first time you flashed it, there is literally no reason for it not to boot again on a clean flash.  




 I'd love one! 




 Its a fresh install, and has been an issue the whole time (even before I managed to get it to boot to desktop). I don't see how reinstalling could fix it.  




 So I just recently got my hackintosh build up and running, everything works (except for some sound issues that I'm dealing with, but I am confident in my Google-fu for those) but I am having the most bizarre issue: every time I boot into OSX, my CD drive ejects itself (at the apple logo)? And when I get to the desktop I get a popup stating that I have inserted a blank disk (and asking me what to do with it). I have an Asus B75 Pro3-M as my motherboard, if that's relevant.

edit: in case anyone with the same issue comes across this in the future, updating to 10.9.4 fixed the cd tray issue. 
 




 Uh because the reason people get there early is to prep for the day - prep that will screw you over later in the shift (at rush times) if it isn't done. The time spent serving is wasted prep time. I run bars at weddings and if I stop prep to serve the few early birds then I'm running around trying to get stock (beer, fruit, clean glasses etc) during the rush, making me lose more money than if I had just ignored the few early birds.  




 Hello Melbourne-dwelling redditors! I have plans to move to Melbourne (from the Gold Coast) in January and wanted to get some advice on a few things:

1. **Housing**: Firstly, I need somewhere to stay. I intend for the move to be permanent, so I am looking for something long term, and was leaning towards a house share with a couple of other roommates (so I don't get lonely). My question is this: I would really love to have living arrangements sorted before I head down there, but a lot of people I have spoken to have advised against making a commitment to a place that I haven't seen in person, as people will often post misleading photos on the internet and places are generally a lot less favourable when you actually get there. I'm also a bit worried about getting scammed and sending a bond payment to a person for a house that doesn't even exist. How prevalent are these scammers in Melbourne? Is this something I should be looking out for? How realistic is it of me to expect to have living arrangements made before I go down there? Would I be better off staying in a hotel for a few weeks while I inspect houses? Would people be willing to agree to let me rent from them without even having met me first? I thought having a Skype call might mediate some of these issues - myself and the ad poster would get a feel for each other and then they could give me a sort of 'virtual tour' around the home. Also, how early should I start inquiring for accommodation? I have noticed a lot of the Gumtree ads are looking for people to move in ASAP, so I don't think they'd be willing to wait for me to come down in January - but I really don't want to be leaving it to the last minute.

2. **Work**: As well as living arrangements, I would also like to have a job strapped down for when I get there. Many of the same questions apply here; how likely would it be for an employer to hire me based on a phone/Skype interview? I would like to start working immediately when I get down there. I have approx. 1.5 years worth of hospitality experience, the last 4-5 months of that being in a senior supervisor role - how marketable is this experience? Are there a lot of hospitality jobs going down in Melbourne?

3. **Transport**: This I'm not too worried about, but thought I'd mention it just in case I'm being a little naive. I've been to Melbourne about 5 times in the last 2 years, so I have a fairly decent feel of the inner city suburbs and how the public transport works. However, I will be without a license until mid February, and without a car until I can afford one. How survivable is Melbourne without a car? Will I be able to rely entirely on public transport (I would like to avoid taxis at all costs, those things are killer expensive)? I have no family or friends down there, so I have nothing to fall back on (other than taxis...) if I get stuck somewhere there isn't public transport. I intend on buying a bicycle as soon as I get down there as well, and I am used to riding around to get myself from A to B. 




 When someone is having an anxiety attack its important to 'ground' them. Usually resting a hand on an arm or a shoulder and speaking to them calmly will be the most you can do. Generally the person suffering the anxiety attack just has to let it pass. Just let them know you're there. If you realize they're having a panic attack, tell them. "You're having a panic attack. You are not dying. It will pass soon. Try to steady your breathing." in the calmest voice possible. 




 HSCs are a standardized test that certain parts of Australia undertake at the end of highschool. It's what gets you into university. If you fail the HSC, no university will touch you and yes, there are other ways in but they can add another 1-2 years onto your study. It's a pretty big deal.  




 I stayed in Cambodia recently for just under a week and honestly, in comparison to home (Australia) there were virtually none. No flies either. I did stay in Siem reap though, so it might be different in the more rural areas.  




 Just for clarification: "driving" as specified by the law here (QLD: $330 fine for touching your phone) means your car is running, regardless of where you are. Just started your car in the parking lot and quickly checking a route on Google Maps? $330 fine. Hit 'next' on your music player at a stop light? $330 fine, and now you've lost your license. I understand the reason for the rules, I really do, but seriously, stupidest fucking thing ever. (I may or may not have first hand experience with this...) 




 Movie 43

 Its from Movie 43. Essentially just a bunch of random skits. In this one, Emma stone plays a checkout chick at a grocery store and falls head over heels for a really gross looking customer. He's sweet talking her in this scene.  




 If it is actually him, it could be a trick of he lighting. The photo on the left has a flash directly pointed at him, causing shadows under his chin and jaw, making it more pronounced, while the second photo is lit from the right hand side, making his chin seem weaker.

 I'm pretty sure hangouts is closed-source and Google doesn't provide any APIs for 3rd parties to hook in, so you're not likely to see a 3rd party with hangouts capability any time soon, if ever. 




 Son I'm too high for this 




 Fair enough. I just can't imagine being any level of upset/annoyed if this happened to me. I used to make graphic-intensive profile designs and coding (all original) for some anime forum site, and I had people messaging me about other members lifting my graphics and even code (with my comments still in it) and selling it for the in game currency - it never bothered me in the slightest, in fact I even remember feeling excited the first time it happened lol. 




 Not trying to be a dick here but... does it really matter? I'm not entirely sure why people on reddit get so upset about reposts. The entire idea of reddit is built upon linking to other websites, which can be considered "reposting". I get that it can take a significant amount of time to create a gif, especially high quality ones (I've just started doing it myself so I can appreciate the effort that goes into them), but unless the reposter is making real world $$$ from it, I don't see the issue.

 About monetizing xposed tweaks - a lot of xposed devs put their modules on the play store as well, but charge for them (while they are freely available on the repo). I think that's a fairly honorable way to get donations and a little easier than trying to get people to send you money through PayPal (people trust google more).
