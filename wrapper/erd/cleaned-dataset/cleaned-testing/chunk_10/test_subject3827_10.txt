 That wasn't the question though 




 They did hire all those swordsmen and parkour professionals 




 I would think that Furious 7 and Rogue Nation (as well as Star Wars and Spectre I guess) all stand a chance - heck, 3 of those movies haven't even come out yet, but from what we've seen they seem like likely candidates. 




 Not a sequel, spinoff, remake, reboot, adaptation, or based on any historical event/person. 




 Yeah but I think the security around those movies is very different 




 Argo! 




 What? 




 That's not melodramatic at all, jut bad writing - I don't think those lines were intended to pull at your emotions. 




 Kubrick's or Lean's Lord of the Rings 




 A long, long, time ago... 




 If you're being realistic, then I don't know why you think there's any way it would leak 2 WEEKS before! 




 The rumor is actually that George didn't have enough money in his ink fund to print the extra letter on all the merchandise and posters  




 WHATS WRONG WITH YOUR FAAACCCCEEEE 




 That starts with Doc Brown's lab and Marty walking in  




 Is it midnight on September 3rd (very very earlier on the 4th I guess) or is it midnight on the 4th when they come out? 




 Exactly, but you talked about it like everyone on /r/movies was wrong and your opinion was the right one. 




 Yeah but mostly everyone else thought it was great - you're taking what's considered an above average movie and calling it decent, not the other way around. 




 That's what I thought originally too 




 That just confirmed a Star Wars presence, not The Force Awakens specifically.  




 Eh, it's still a possibility. 




 Dude is 84, older than Nimoy was when he died.., 




 Yeah but Iwata had health problems 




 It's delicious, and you should try it 




 50 miles from Sonic 




 I've never heard of it! Some sort of gem, perhaps? Is it underrated? 




 I think there was, but Kasdan is usually able to handle characters well. 




 I would argue that Palpatine is the main villain of the PT - he's not present as much as Vader is in terms of actively terrorizing our heroes, but he's the one pulling all the strings.

I think each of the TFA villains will mirror an OT one-

Hux - Tarkin
Phasma - Boba Fett
Kylo Ren - Vader
Smoke - The Emporer 




 That's not an Imagineer dude 




 It still was the same thing in both trilogies if you think about it:

Overall villain: Palpatine

Episode 1 villain: Maul
Episode 2 villain: Dooku
Episode 3 villain: Grevious partially, but more Palpatine


Overall villain: Vader

Episode 4 villain: Tarkin
Episode 5 villain: Vader (at his strongest point)
Episode 6 villain: Palpatine (Vader is redeemed) 




 Poster - a teaser (especially one that short) has very little value once the actual movie is released. A poster is a piece of art that we can admire forever. 




 I hope these conversations are included as part of the "making of" book for TFA 




 "I... Uh... Find a way.... TO KILL YOU!" 




 It also fits with Creed, with the rumors that Rocky is diagnosed with cancer. 




 Is it just me or does Chevy Chase look like a heavier Larry David? 




 Jaws had POV shark shots and if anything that added to the suspense 




 I feel like BvS will try to cram too much stuff in, just for the sake of getting ready for Justice League. With Civil War, they've had like 11 movies to get ready. It also makes a difference that we know the Marvel characters very well, whereas there has only been 1 other DCU movie. 




 The 3 month old trailer has like 60 million views on the official Star Wars YT channel alone - it broke the record for the most views on a trailer in a 24 hour period.

Have you been living under a rock or something for the last 40 years? 




 DAE think Star Wars is nerdy? How can it not be? It's not like these movies have made billions of dollars over the years or anything lol who goes to see that???? Ayy lmao!!!!!!!
 




 You mean Office Space? 




 I have a friend like that - apparently there's no way a movie can be watchable if it was made before modern technology existed. 

He thought Back to the Future was cheesy, despite only having seen the first 10 minutes of it. 




 I think there's a lot about Boyhood that relies on who you are - I thought it was good, but it was far from being my favorite movie of the year. I loved Birdman though. 




 Beetlejuice. 




 I think people took it in a negative way 




 I don't think it's particularly *bad* now (the Season 26 finale was pretty funny), it's just different. It caters to a more modern audience. 




 You have to admit that if the prequels did one thing well, it was the design of the ships and creatures. 




 Really? I think that's one of the better episodes actually. 




 I don't know about that, but I think they have some idea about who the character is. 




 And the fact that they had to actually paint Kramer's portrait, sculpt fusilli Jerry, etc 




 I think he probably knows, with all the fan rumors and everything - after all, it was Kasdan who said Darth Vegas, and Abrams was the one who said no to the question. 




 He's been right about a lot of things. A lot.

Leaked concept art, scene descriptions, character descriptions, trailer descriptions, having access to frames from the actual movie, etc. 




 Yeah but basically there's no way they can turn a profit on that if everyone who funds the movie essentially gets their money back, 




 I know it's probably impossible to choose, but I'll go first:

(In no particular order)

The Marine Biologist
The Stakeout
The Movie
The Outing
The Conversion 




 Those are in no way slapstick comedy movies. They are smart, well written movies with good humor - basically what Star Trek is. 




 "If you write this, I'll let you have a part in Star Wars!" 




 They could write it in as a plot element in 8 or 9 




 Apple or iOS? 




 The Grand Bondapest Hotel 




 Er... It was nominated for 8 Oscars and won 1, and the New York Times film critic said it was "far and away the most surprising and cinematically exciting motion picture to be seen here in many a moon. " 




 Steven Spielberg: I would say any of his films from the late 70s and early 80s (Jaws, Close Encounters, Raiders, E.T.), and then slowly transition into his more dramatic works (Schindler's List, Munich, Lincoln) 




 These arrows are making me thirsty! 




 Universally panned but it won 2 Oscars and was nominated for best picture? 




 Yeah I'd say if is 




 Very true  




 Not anywhere close - Star Wars is Star Wars, and BvS is an average looking sequel to a decent movie that came out only 2 years ago - there's a big difference. 




 Bridge of Spies? Steve Jobs maybe? 




 *These* PRENTZELS... Are making *me* THIRSTY! 




 Actually curvy TVs seem to be coming back around 




 K 




 Whatever dude 




 By routinely you mean from that other thread once? After you looked in my post history? 




 Sorry I didn't see what you were replying to 




 It's a character from a comedic review, not someone's actual voice. 




 Star Wars, James Bond, Mission Impossible, MCU, Pixar movies, X-Men, Pirates of the Carribean... 




 Honestly? I think Michael Bay is a pretty good director, but a lot of his movies are badly written. 




 Yeah but you answered your rhetorical question, which isn't something you're supposed to do... 




 To the majority of people, that's probably not true. 




 I'm not saying it is, but it's not nearly as bad as Rise of the Silver Surfer. 




 The Phantom Menace still had a lot going for it - great special effects, a few good performances, and it was the first Star Wars movie in 16 years, so there's that. 




 I bought a computer to upvote this 




 I think that was the actual Soup Nazi, who said that the show ruined his life. 




 I don't think so - it only uses old footage, and there's really no reason for a TV spot 5 months from release.  




 Ha I know I was being sarcastic 




 Full scale, probably.


Keep in mind that they're using real sets, practical effects. It's all real. And did I mention practical effects? The opposite of CGI. Less of that, more of this. And by this I mean practical effects, which I don't think I mentioned earlier. They're real life effects by the way, not done on a computer. It'll look cool. /s 




 He does in some part of the movie, but in other parts he has the one in [this photo.](http://imgur.com/Y1NEVI1)

(On the left) 




 I still think it's pretty awesome 




 X-Wing pilots have always had names like Poe.

"Dak"
"Jek"
"Wedge"
"Biggs"

 




 NBC has nothing to do with Spectre, by the way.

Disney happens to be very protective of their properties, and Jurassic World really isn't the same as Star Wars. 




 You really think that looks anything like Greg Grunberg? 




 Knowing the release date of an anticipated film is nerdy? 




 Yeah I remember the days when Lego used to be one of the most popular toy brands...

Oh wait 




 ... 




 Not really... It's probably the most popular franchise ever, and it's made more than 30 billion dollars from all the sales of Star Wars merchandise. That's not something a nerdy movie is able to accomplish easily... 




 Basically no indie movie has any chance of making money next year.

Star Wars, BvS, Civil War, X-Men, Suicide Squad, Independence Day, Finding Dory, Warcraft, Star Trek, Ice Age, Ghostbusters, Borne, Gambit, Doctor Strange, Fantastic Beasts, Assassin's Creed, and Star Wars again....

 




 Me too! High five! 




 But if this movie is out, Star Wars will be out. And Star Wars isn't really that nerdy of a movie, either.

ayy lmao 




 In what sense? I have seen it. 




 Are you seriously calling Fury Road an auteur film? 




 Affleck one his Oscar for Good Will Hunting, not The Town. 

Mad Max is just as much a risk as Furious 7 is. It's still a sequel, and it's an action movie. That appeals to a lot of people.

And nowadays the standard budget for most major studio films is somewhere around 100 million, and if the studio really didn't have confidence in those projects, they wouldn't have greenlit them. Only a few of those examples flopped, most were financial or critical successes. 




 Suicide Squad takes place before BvS - Batman is in it, and the Joker is in it. In the latest BvS trailer, we see Robin's suit with presumably the Joker's handwriting on it. I doubt they'd take the time to tell this story in that movie, so it's more likely that they would wait for Suicide Squad - or possibly Affleck's solo Batman movie. 




 I definitely wouldn't call any of those projects risks particularly.

Nolan and Cuaron are critically acclaimed directors, Affleck is an Oscar winner, and the Wachowskis have made many successful projects in the past. 

Those are not risks. Most of those projects payed off, and it wasn't expected that they wouldn't.

It would be risky to throw 200 million dollars at a director who's only directed 1 feature film - and Universal are the ones that did that  with Jurassic World, not WB. 




 Kids today will never know about The Suite Life of Zack and Cody and the Nintendo DS? 

Both of those were products of the mid-2000s... 









 No, it was the content that hurt it, not the rating. If it still had the same content but an R rating, why would that be any different? *Less* people would see it. 




 I guess so, but that doesn't make it any less true  









 Sorry! 




 It's classified as a rock in the same way that Mars is classified as a rock - Pluto is just a dwarf planet. 




 I think that would be way too disrespectful to everyone who put hard work and effort into those movies... 




 Kasdan is writing it as well, so I don't think it will be 




 First of all, Plinkett elaborated as to why that shot didn't work in comparison to the opening shot of A New Hope.

Second, there's no way Roger Ebert gave TPM 4 and 1/2 stars because his rating only goes up to 4 - it was 3 and 1/2 stars.

And third - there was tons of effort put into the prequels by the actors and most of the crew, but George Lucas is not a good director. Watch the interview Ewan McGregor did on The Graham Norton show the other week, where he tells a story about how Lucas has a lot of trouble directing characters. He puts visuals above story a lot of the time, which leads to a bad movie.

I could very easily go out and make a crummy movie, and say that it's a homage to bad movies like Howard the Duck and Jaws 4, but that doesn't justify it being bad. 




 Oh yeah, like all those speeches from Obama where he constantly says that ISIS is a problem that needs to be stopped? 




 Yeah, but it's not Tommy Wiseau cringe-bad
