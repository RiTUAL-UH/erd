 Older:  Ask The Dust by John Fante.  He ws a fantastic writer, way ahead of his time, and he became masterful in time, but the ending to Ask The Dust was so melodramatic and ridiculously angsty.

Newer:  Not that big of a fan, but The Hunger Games.  I don't believe the government's actions were that far-fetched as brutal regimes have done worse on people and their children over the course of history, but even if little teenage tough-gal became the poster-woman of a revolution, it's hard for me to believe that she wouldn't quickly be swept aside as propoganda in lou of more experienced leaders, mercenaries and so forth.  Sure, she's there for moral support, but I'd hope these hardened workers turned soldiers could carry on even if they didn't have a teenage girl as their mascot. 




 Yes.  Please fungineer my imagination and view of the world for me!  Make me believe!!!!!!!

(haha, sorry, it's just, the made up term 'imagineer' has always sort of had a totalitarian and slightly creepy vibe to me :)

 




 It's hard to sometimes separate the artist from the art, but ideally, I can enjoy something, even if the creator of it is a total crab-hammering douche novel.  The short answer is - no, usually I don't let an asshole artist get in the way of enjoying their art - though if it does bother me that much for whatever reason, I try not to support said doucher. 




 How did it not in turn rip Mr. Plier dude's face off? 




 That one guy (or girl).  They are virtually on any site, ready to jump down your throat because they made assumptions about whatever it is you are saying or asking about, and without even fully understanding what you are getting at, they unleash a tirade of patronizing, malcontent, hostile bull-shit right in your fucking eyes.  Seriously, fuck you, that one guy. 




 Was your grandma always an asshole?  Or just Catholic? :P 




 I like the options notion.

"Welcome to McHeaven, Jesus here, can I please take your order?  For an unlimited time of eternity, if you masturbate you will be burning in hell with Satan.  Are you interested?"

"No thank you.  Can I just have a cheeseburger, and some cool people to hang around with for the rest of forever?"

"Sorry, there are only Jehova's Witnesses up here."

"Shit.  I'll take hell with two extra orders of Satan please."

"Coming right up.  Please pull up to the next cloud to exchange your soul." 




 Yeah.  Take that, hell-surviving veterans! 




 Totally.  I want to look at it longer, reach out, touch it, maybe put my hand inside just for a second to see what its like, but in all seriousness man, as an empty internet gesture that many of us do - I wish you the best of luck, good doctors, and keep up your awesome fucking sense of humor.  I hope I can look that bitch death in the eyes with a modicum of your gallow giggles.

Also - you believe in an afterlife?  Or is it ashes to ashes, dust to dust? 




 Dude!  Where is your spine?! 




 Why? Lil Wayne's rhymes and raps are like kindergarden compared to Em.  Seriously.  Wayne can't write for shit - it's not even unoriginal, mediocre, def-jam high-school poetry group bad, it's straight out retard bad.  Not tryna be a dick, but I just don't understand D: 




 LOL.  Exactly.  By the 8th time in a row he rhymes nigga with nigga, my ears are pretty fuckin perked! 




 About which point? :D   




 Ok, my apologies for the loose use of words.  It wasn't hijacked.  I think we're still on the same page though:  wanting to have the cake and eat it too, and we fight any perceived sexism, real or imagined, with even bigger sexism, and it's been total shit going on way-too-long now.  I look forward to looking into those you have mentioned.  Thanks again.

edit:clarity and grammar what nots 




 Thanks.  Will check it out soon. 




 I agree that history and context are important, hence my questions along these lines.  I'm familiar with some of what you wrote, and some I am not, and you seem to have a good education all this, and I would like to learn more myself.  I appreciate your input, though I see a misunderstanding between us, as I'd disagree with you on saying people haven't hijacked feminism (or any other movement) for their own personal agenda (usually money and power).  I think the key word here is 'outside.'  


I never meant it as an outside issue (ie, pepsi cola came in because they thought they could get a bigger market share from women spenders), I just meant those same people drawn to the movement kept it alive, pushing it forward through new mutations, when like you said, it should have gone away.  As for those people making lots of money and fame off this, or at the least trying to get some attention or pussy or an easy ride or whatever, they might use the same platform or alter it any which way to keep pushing it forward, but at the end of the day they are in it for their own selfish reasons and personal gain.   

The most dangerous ones are the nutjobs actually believe in what they say, and what disturbs me, is that this seems to be the majority of them, or at least, the most vocal and garish ones, the ones who garner large crowds and attention and influence, and this is the kind of bull-shit that makes the news everyday, and all the "i am trying to bring awareness to gender issues," and usually they mean, "I want people to listen and do as I say, and I want to make a living doing it, and by gender issues, I mean, women, because they are more important than men."  As you said, it isn't about equality, it is about favoring women over men.  Still, I tend to want to over-simplify it as "having their cake and eating it too."

edit:  format 




 Also - another question for you.  From your experience, as well as any statistics you may have on the subject, how do those issues apply and what does that wind up looking like in the engineering field?  Are they paid less?  Taken less seriously, etc?  Thank sin advance if and when ya get a chance to answer this. 




 I get it.  Thanks guys. 




 Are we talking within their historical context and so forth?  The difference of how movements, in this case feminism, are often hijacked for whatever agendas people try to push? 




 That has always been my biggest issue, especially by the original suffrogates.  The whole 'we want to have our cake, and eat it to' 




 So would that be a recomended read to study up on the history and momentum and semantics and goals of the movement from past to present? 




 I get what you are saying, but you misunderstood what I was getting it.  In that instance, I was not talking about the modern, undying, endless complaint of feminism, the feminism that I'm pretty sure both you and I and everyone else here knows is bat-shit crazy, unfounded, and continues to favor women at the expense of men (ie, the feminism that long ago usurped equality, the feminism that those polls and I agree on).  What I mentioned was the textbook definition of feminism, which is sort of what brought this conversation and line of questioning around in the first place, and while your first response was helpful, it seems to me that you are jumping ahead of the conversation now.  Most responses on this post so far have been very neutral, resonable, and thought-provoking - those posters understood what I was and am asking -  and it was far removed from "this thread might not be for you," so please don't patronize me.


As you said yourself, a lot of people support equality.  Here is the dictionary definition of feminism:  the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men.  Being that we are well past that, it is not relevant.  There is nothing about propogating myths, bull-shit patriarchy theory, rape-culture horse-plop, and other common delusions that are bad for both men and women.  It is simple equality.  Again, just as you said, a lot of people support equality, and again, a lot of people believe (myself included) that feminism is supporting women at the expense of men, and this is why I wanted to ask these questions - to see if and how and where is it still relevant?


And why do I ask this?  Because any dialogue, debate, conversation, or issue has many sides, and I'd be a dick to not see what the reasonable and sane people in their field are saying these days, because all I can find is reactionary, myth-spreading, propoganda bull-shit from illogical, unreasonable SJW's and wierdo feminists.  These self-absorbed peoople have drowned out the sane people in their respective field of work, and this has been the problem - it has been hard to find them.  Hence, this thread. 




 Right, and the same thing could be said about men:  Ie, in China, men are burdened with the responsibility of taking care of their elder parents, hence everyone wants boys instead of girls.  In a lot of Arab countries, while woman are often treated poorly, so are the men, and the men are still required by law to be the sole providers for their family, so once more, there is no need to prioritize women over men.  As you said, we both have our unique challenges. 




 Perfect.  I was looking for something like this.  Thank you - will have to check it out and see if it is indeed... relevant and 'fair,' or 'sane,' for lack of better words :)

 




 Bingo.  Feminism is no longer a legitimate complaint, it is an endless complaint.  But that's what I was looking for - to see if there are any relevant or sane ones in the Western World.  Thanks for your input :D
 




 Yeah - but that goes with pecking orders - a lack of structure and heirarchy, but then again, dissenters always pop up in any movement, and I've seen all the in-fighting between feminist rhethoric of "real feminist have curves" vs. "real feminists love their bodies no matter what" or choice feminist vs. total feminist or more "important matters" and I'm right and you're wrong and all the pointless back and forth of it all - but it still remains shallow and irrelevant because as far as the text book definition of feminism goes that most people are fine with, we surpassed that long ago.


As for Marxism, I didn't say all of them were or are that way, but take someone like Bell Hook, and you have a potential cult leader who makes Marx look like a moderate.  Worse, she has influenced many feminists since her time.  Thank god there are enough sane people out there who just ignore nutjobs like her :) 




 Ah, that's what I figured.  That any feminist who wanted to be taken seriously beyond the far-flung cultish modern-day feminist circle would have to call themselves something else, to dissasociate themselves from all the extremists.  That being said, "equity feminist" sounds like the textbook definition of feminism, which, I'm pretty sure no polite and mostly sane person would really argue against, BUT, this goes back to the original point.  Is it even necessary in the Western World? Being that we have more or less reached that ideal and continue to go far beyond it in any reasonable manner?  




 Hi.  How ya doin?  Your response sounds a bit bristly, at least, thats how it reads to me but I totally get it.  This is my main question - is all that is left cringeworthy, leftist, socialist nutjobs who will never be happy until the world is torn down, and reconstructed from the vagina up? 




 What's up guys?  Dead serious in my questions here.  Are there some modern feminists who are actually relevant in the western world, making logical and reasonable arguments in the name of whatever their causes are?  I ask, because I'm so inundated with the chronically malcontent, marxist, completely illogical and hypocritical nutjobs like the Sarkisians and Hooks and Parks and SJW's and etc - the one's who say "gender issues" and mean women only, because what else would they talk about?  


To clarify, I suppose I could as, are there feminist women akin to say, Karen Straughan as an MRA, making sane, historically accurate, fact-based, logical arguments in whatever facet of feminism they are chatting about?  Or does that even exist?  


Because all I find in my searching is historically inaccurate bull-shit, emotional/identity politics, and people talking out of their asses.


Thanks in advance for your replies.


Edit:  To be clear, I am asking here because I don't want to steep my fingers and brain in the piranha infested waters of feminist echo chambers here on Reddit.  Also, I'm banned from most of said echo chambers, because as you know, positing polite, rational, arguments and dissenting opinions and facts are all synonymous with harassment, hence I got the ban-hammer.  Thanks again. 




 "This world - why does everything gotta turn to mush?  It reminds me of Alphabits cereal.  See, you're too young to remember, but my dad.  My dad used to pour his stale beer into my alphabits and make me eat it.  And I'd look at those letters, those fucking letters, and part of me knew they were little pieces of a bigger whole.  They made up tha bigger picture, ya know?  You could create something out of 'em.  But I'd stare at those fuckin letters, and they were everywhere.  None of it made any sense.  A's and B's and C's all over the place, and I knew they were supposed to make up words, but there were no words in that shit soup.  I looked and I looked but it was all meaningless.  No rhyme or reason.  And even then, it all turned to mush in the end anyway.  Everything turns into mush."  

Edit:  obligatory big word - zamboni!

 Apparently no one here has a sense of humor :D 




 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 




 Is it true - Is Pluto no longer classified as a planet?  How come no body told me?! :( 




 Always some dip-shit in a BMW derping up the road-ways :/ 




 Yeah. If each dude owns equal shares, or any shares period, he couldn't just write him out. He'd have to buy him out. You'd have to make it more like, A gave B a high position w/o actual ownership, and then fired him, though, that takes out the whole impact of a sly maneuver. It becomes a boss firing a dude rather than betrayal. That, or do some research and find exceptions and loopholes to these things for yourself. In the history of business, I'm sure plenty of slime-balls have figured out how to screw over their slime ball partners, it just has to be believable :D 




 Yeah.  That's what us viewers/readers are left with considering Martin's and the show-writers' creative choices.  I mean, none of them knew how it would truly pan out for the fans, and to that I say, sure, subvert it all you want, but that doesn't mean it's going to come off as a good narrative, or more importantly, a satisfying one :/ 




 I agree on the fuck everyone part, but if it really is as simple as killing off Jon (along with Stanis who we have been following since season 1 and everyone else), I will truly be annoyed at what I see as lazy story-telling.  I get it that it is subversive story-telling and not a formulaic tale of "good vs. evil" and all that, but still, what's the point?  If you're just going to kill anyone and everyone off, stop being a dick to fans and taking forever to tell the story.  Just condense it and be done with it already, because one ending in this case and method is apparently as good as any other :D 




 Butt paying?  How does one butt pay?  0_o

Butt yes, good point! 




 But that's part of being a *I'm a how shit works in the real world-ist.*  No one wants to do that, but most of them do.  Except the people who are starving in third world shit-holes :D 




 Full circle, AKA, "I'm born to pay bills and die-ist" :P 




 Yeah, most of you were born to also not use your turn signals, and hold up lines in stores to ask stupid questions :D 




 Most* of you are. 




 Right.  If only Hitler would have run on the platform of *"We're gonna systematically kill off millions of Jews and other perverts,"* rather than just blaming them for Germany's problems.


Honestly, I'd vote for a politician who was that straight-forward, so long as he didn't discriminate.  *"Kill 'em all"* is what my grandma always said.  No time or need to discriminate :)


Edit:  To be sure, this wasn't meant as /sarcastic or smart-assery.  I do appreciate that line of thought, but that doesn't make me stop wishing that good, old, honorable and stupid Ned was still around :( 




 [His face double.](http://www.wallpaperhi.com/Animals/Dogs/Basset_hound_dog_Sad_puppy_13477) 




 According to the show's writers, to secure Martin's trust, they had to answer who they thought Jon Snow's mother was.  Source:  http://www.businessinsider.com/the-game-of-thrones-writers-had-to-answer-this-trick-question-2015-4


Why would Jon's parentage even matter if he wasn't alive as a player in the story?  Quite simply, it wouldn't.  And if in George's mind that is the pivotal question to ask in this story, then it wouldn't make sense to leave him as dead, even though resurrection has been sparse thus far in the narrative.  It would just be another dead-end plot line. My speculation is that Stanis was done away with (be it dead or made irrelevant) so Melisandre could be written back to Castle Black to bring Jon to life.  


Would love to here other's opinions and ideas here, be it for or against the liklihood of Jon coming back.


Edit:  Clarity and English speaking gooder 




 Dude.  He's not dead:  http://www.businessinsider.com/the-game-of-thrones-writers-had-to-answer-this-trick-question-2015-4


Why would GRR even ask the question, or why would Jon's parentage matter if Jon wasn't alive?  I suppose it could be another plot-line that doesn't matter, as this show ultimately has plenty of those :D

Edit:  Here, I just posted this:  http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/39w2w3/all_spoilers_how_i_know_a_certain_character_isnt/ 




 Don't get me wrong.  I love these sadists.  Let's hear it! 




 Haven't we been misled before though?  I mean, would he be allowed to say anything else if say, the Lord of Light was going to bring him back? 




 Would totally make demon-babies with her :D


I hope she is a plot device to bring Jon Snow to life back at Castle Black :D 




 I think you're a big 'ol domey, but I agree.  I think they're either gonna kill Jon off forever, or the Lord of Firecrackers will bring him to life.  Why else would they write the fire-slut back to Castle Black?  What other purpose does she serve now that her host Stanis is dead?  What power-hungry, child-murdering, dick-wad will she attach herself to next. 




 Yeah, but even with Martin's points about subverting traditional narrative, not even he knew how all this would affect his readers and fans.  I'm okay with plots not panning out the way I expect them, as I agree that they keep us fans on our toes, but to have a character since season one peter out like that, just seemed kinda...lame, almost like *that actor was asking for too much money, just kill them off* kinda lame :D 




 I like to flay puppies and rape my wife too, but I swear, I'm not that hateable :D 




 Yeah, hence I said *(or at least what we see of it [Stanis' ending])*, and I do agree that it was kinda fun that it came around full circle to Stanis being sentenced to die by Brie the Cheese Amazonian, but at the same time, it just kinda seemed, meager and weak, or easy, or even a bit cheesy and lazy...  


I guess this goes in line with what I said in this same post about subverting the traditional narrative:  you don't get the simple satisfaction of *beginning - middle - end, good (or bad) guys saves the day, and somebody wins,* and you are left with a few moments of satisfaction in between a sea of too many story-lines, favorite character's deaths, and a book-series that might never be finished, but again, that rests on the reader or viewer's opinions :D 




 In subverting traditional narrative and creating an unprecedented epic like GoT, this is what we are left with:  there IS NO satisfaction to be had, at least anything that is akin to traditional story telling (literature, movies, etc).  It's more closely related to history - a lot of people vie for power and riches, but most just fall by the wayside.  I don't think Martin himself knew the true effect it would have on his fans, or story-telling in general, even though he has made his statements on these matters, and more power to him for it.  


The point is, what we get are few moments of satisfaction in between a lot of frustration, character deaths, and annoying story-arcs that either go on too long, or peter out with little fanfare (Stanis), or aren't given enough development and focus, but those opinions are all up to the reader and/or viewer. 




 Dude, the Hebrew God was a total dick.  Take that, you pillar of salt!  \

Edit:  that being said, journey or not, I thought the end for Stanis (or at least what we see of it) was kinda lame.  But I guess that goes hand in hand with the journey - it's not all fireworks, but I don't care to justify their creative direction.  It was lame :D 




 I just put a pack of frozen peas on my head.  Bam!  Dinner and coolant! 




 Stupid people.  Shouldn't some sort of politician gotten rid of a good 75% of people by now?!  Seriously.  The streets and roads are clogged with idiots who just stare at things and don't use turn signals and are oblivious to what's around them :D 




 I see through your tricks, James Troutman!  */tinfoil hat on* 




 Can you alliterate that a bit more? 




 For the most part, I agree with a lot of writers here who say to stick with "say/says/said."  I don't advise or report or remind or taunt on any given day, but I likely said some shit. Said works great.


The rest are often too mechanical, and there is nothing worse than reading someone who just figured out how to use a thesaurus, but if a writer can make them work, then go for it :D 




 Are you 20 or younger by chance?  Mid to late teens?  Either way, if this is the style you are pursuing, I can at least say that it is suited to young adults, and not adult-adults.  That being said, you still need to work on your grammar, spelling, and organization.  You need what every young and amateur writer needs:  hundreds and thousands of hours of practice and study.  It's not a bad thing, it's just the way of things.


Don't worry about the formatting, I know reddit can be a PITA.  As for an honest analysis from myself, this sums it up:  *" Before you zone out ,and stop reading-*" Too late, I already did.  I feel sort of patronized by that, almost as if the author is saying, *"I know this is boring, but hang with me for a bit longer."*  Why would I?  Why should I?  I'm not saying that I would never be interested in this sort of comic-book esque, punchy and gimmicky young-adult thrill ride, but it would have to be rock solid in execution (and I'm talking all around delivery, not just grammar and spelling) for me to keep going. 




 It shows up as [removed].  I think the mods took it down?  And as an FYI, original posters still see their comments, even if they have been banned/removed/whatever, though I don't know if it's true in all cases. 




 Now I'm sad :P 




 Uh oh...  I see you removed it, but that is not a good sign to me that you begin with "what spelling errors."  That being said, I can't provide an example because you removed it, but instead, might I suggest more practice in both reading and writing, especially with fundamentals in grammar and spelling.  Good luck to you! 




 Glad you took the time to comment. 




 Haha.  I love the touch on maturity in there.  Thanks for the list.  There's nothing like a decade or two to help one mature as a person, and a writer.  As for myself, my voice is bedrock, but even with thousands of hours of practice (both reaqin and writing) behind me, I still feel like there are thousands of more to go, to be as good as I need and want to be, for any given story's sake.  Wish me luck, and thanks again :) 




 Neil Gaiman is masterful artist, and while it might seem like a dick-move at first, he is telling a novice to start with the basics, the root of the whole thing: writing (as a reflection of what you want to read, and by proxy have read).  It isn't magic, it's work.  Sure, there are a zillion how-to books and degrees, and more specific and cryptic advice out there, but at the end of the day, it comes down to reading and writing.  There is no magic, no trick, no easy way around hundreds and thousands of hours of practice, patience, and work.


I mean, how many posts pop up here (and elsewhere) of, *"Hey, I want to be a writer, but I don't read much, and I don't write much, (or at all).  How do I write a master-piece?"* 

Worth noting, these far-fetched desires of instant gratification, or seeking the easiest route are not limited to people who want to 'become' writers.  :) 




 I love KVJ and his rules, among the many other writers and their own self-chosen rules, but I've read plenty of masterful writers who violated any and all of these, KVJ included.  But that is to be expected once people are experienced and skilled enough.  I mainly say this because plenty of these rules will just confuse new and less experienced writers, even more so if they try to adhere to the zillions of other rules out there.  The end result could scatter their efforts in a million directions, none of them being any good, but even that is a learning experience.  Case in point, see #7 


Also, as much as I love writers torturing their characters to show off their mettle or lack thereof (myself included), there is also something to be said of the moments in between the action, where the characters truly live.  This should not be overlooked or glossed over, though it depends on the genre, as there are big differences in character driven stories and action driven stories.  The point is, I'd just like to point out that any idiot with a pulse can survive a disaster, whether they do it kicking and screaming, or with great poise and dignity, but it's the little moments, the moments that make up the majority of our lives, that really define us and put us to the test. 




 Oh, cool.  I hope it helps.  I just used it today.  I uploaded a file to Onedrive straight from my home PC at 4AM, and accessed it a little while ago from my e-mail to print and edit it from a different PC, using word online.  Sure, I could just e-mail it to myself, or use a USB, but it does give you a lot of options, especially when you have accesss to the internet to use MS word online, but lack the program itself. 




 I like the subtleness of the thing :) 




 I actually write erotica and romance quite well, but no, as with many men, I don't attempt to write women, because that is best left for the women :D 




 So I dout it is some conspiracy (especially bya  woman-dominated industry) to keep women down.  Are men just more prolific, and more dedicated to the craft?  I mean, it is stupid to hold something against them if it is because they are industrious, prolific, and more driven... 




 I know you asked about a few specific things, but being that you mentioned you lack experience and knowledge, here is a fairly rounded and earnest approach: Writing is work, and it is a skill.  Inspiration comes and goes, but it takes discipline to follow through, especially on less inspired days.  Most talented authors got there by thousands of hours of both reading and writing.  In short, a lot of time and patience and work.  I'd suggest reading a lot and studying what makes great authors so hard to put down (pacing, movement, a good plot, good characters, their own unique style, etc.).  In between reading hundreds of books and stories, work on some of your own material.  As far as organizational skills and learning how to traditionally plot out stories, there are plenty of how-to books and articles out there, just keep in mind that plenty of great writers achieved great or master or even 'decent' status without any how-to books or formal education, but what they did have is experience, in both life, and reading and writing.  

 nbsp;

Most new writers start off with imitation (as do most artists in any field), but that is a good start.  From there you can develop a voice of your own, while learning to spin a good yarn with style and drive and movement, while simultaneously learning to balance all the nuances of exposition, dialogue, plot points, and so forth.

 nbsp;

I know it's not exactly what you asked for, but I believe it to be fair advice for any new writer, as the original post is sort of akin to someone saying, *"I know how to change my oil, now how can I take apart the engine and put it back together?"*  Good luck, now get to work :D 




 Not going to get into plot/story here, as ideally that is all worked out.  As for the rest:


When I have edited it myself several times, have had a few others take a look as well - when I have fixed 99% of minor typos and grammar errors, when the rhythm and cadence is perfect and in step, and when I can read through it without needing to change anything (other than the desire for creative changes)... but even then, I can then change the fuck out of it, but ya gotta call it done sometime. 




 LOL!  That's right, be a sadist!  Show what your characters are made of.  That being said, you know they say any idiot can weather a crisis... but that's when you kill them :D 




 Oh no!  Instead of fan-fic twilight, this is real life 50 shades?  /wrists


In all seriousness, just change the names and circumstances and details and use a pseudonym and don't show your boss and etc. and if he does see it just tell him it's 50 shades of gray fan fic. 




 What is this for?


I don't say this to be a dick, but to be fairly critical:  it sounds  a bit gimmicky, and far too generic.  Also, it needs a lot of proof-reading.  There are spelling errors, abbreviation errors, grammar errors, you can get rid of the cursing as it doesn't add much to it (my opinion there), and in general, it needs some solid polishing. 




 Aside smaller devices with dedicated software and aps, the best I can think to suggest, and the one I enjoy using is MS word and Onedrive hooked into an outlook or Hotmail account.  If I'm in a hurry, I just write and edit within an e-mail draft, but if I have more time and space, I use Onedrive.  Super easy to share, edit from any device, etc.  Worth noting that Hotmail itself comes with MS Word Online free (a stripped down version of MS Word), and lots of storage, and access to for easy sharing, writing, and some other cool features through onedrive.  Between my home CPU, and the mobile versions and onedrive, it all links together quite nicely.


I'd recommend saving often, as I have had ms word online have issues (once in like, 2 years?), but that was related to a crappy internet connection, not the program itself.  Worth noting that I'd recommend that any writer saves often, and to multiple locations, including the cloud and a USB :D
 




 To put it simply as possible, it means demonstrating something through action (creating an active scene) rather than telling it in exposition (like a plain dictionary or encyclopedic explanation). 

Here are a few quick fun and ridiculous examples:

He was the most evil person I ever met, and he was so evil, he was more evil than Satan. Rosemary was very scared. So scared, that she went crazy. (Telling)

His face was statuesque and unmoving as he sucked the last drop of blood from the lifeless child.  Rosemary's skin crawled, her mind recoiling beyond terror, blank and vacuous at having witnessed such a monster.  To this day, she sits in her asylum cell, unable to utter a single word (showing). 


Though these examples are ridiculous, The difference is quite clear. 


That being said, there is more nuance to it than that, as they can border each other very closely, but if the concensus of a large enough sample of people say the same thing, than you might just need to do a better job of showing, and not necessarily try to tell instead. I'd say the biggest difference between masters and amateurs (as with most things in writing), is knowing when to utilize each one, and knowing how to strike a balance between them.  




 Yeah.  Funny that you say that.  Aside more obvious characters that are shown on cover art, or other odds and ends like that, no matter how they describe the characters, I tend to picture them how I want to picture them anyhow, and my imagination fills in any of the blanks, even when I'm not trying consciously to do it.  It's the same thing for voices and other quirks, which is the same reason IMO that a lot of movies are "never as good as the books," because the movie just wasn't as good as I originally imagined it in my head, plus, I might hate the actor they chose, simply because it is far removed from the vision I had in my head :P 




 Yeah.  I tend to take it as a case by case, writer by writer basis.  I mean, my girlfriend loves Nabakov, and as much as I respect his command/love of language, I can't stand reading him.  He is just too verbose, and I'm thinking, get to the point.  That being said, I know book readers read for a variety of reasons, and I appreciate the little nuances and quiet moments of literature.  If I needed constant explosions and plot twists and heart-popping narratives, I'd watch a movie, or read a spy novel (which I don't care for), but for all the writers I do like (many who are well-known enough that they don't or didn't have to rely on punchier hooks or gimmicks), one thing is for certain:  they know how to pace and move a story.  Even if they do get stuck up in someone's head, or even if they do have a lot of quiet moments or a simpler story that doesn't hinge on large action, they have the pacing and movement down solid, without fail.  IMO, that always sets the masters apart their less experienced or less skilled contemporaries, or amateur writers in general.  Plenty of stories that seem uninteresting enough come to mind, but the writers who wrote them were masters at drawing the reader in and tangling them up in the movement and plot, and my god, what happens next?!


What do you prefer and enjoy? 




 My apologies, I meant no offense against you or any other intern out there.  I don't know the ins and outs of large publishing companies.  For example, I did not know they relied so heavily upon interns for key aspects of the work.  I thought they would have started the interns off with a simpler job.  That, and I read that "300 manuscripts a week" as "300 manuscripts a year," which still sounded like a lot ;)


Also, I put another edit onto my second post asking about the pop-psychological to molehill mistake you mentioned, so if you have the time, that would be great.  Also, you should do an AMA sometime :) 




 Thanks for the answers.  Quick follow up questions (with more to come later) - so why does the intern have so much power there?  Are the agents just that busy?  How did they know how they could trust your judgment?


Edit:  Also, can you give an example of this:  *and tried to make plot mountains out of pop-psychology molehills*?  Perhaps I am not as familiar with this because I don't read much women's fiction myself (aside a few really knock-out artists out there), but if it is similar enough to a lot of modern day navel-gazing and hipster-esque writing, and other amateur mistakes, then I might have an idea of what you mean.  :)


Are you talking about the difference of say, literature that deals in more universal and timeless truths, vs. a modern, popular phenomenon that won't hold its weight in the years to come? 




 While we often have similar sexual ques, Keep in mind the gender differences in behavior, as well as what physical aspects of a personality attract each sex, and the differences are quite real (ie, men are typically the ones to initiate contact - they are more aggressive and overt, wheeras females preen and flutter their eye-lashes and smile and perform subtle acts to attract men).

Men often notice women due their physical features (and we all notice appearance before anything else, as we don't have a clue about a stranger's personality), especially since many women use make-up and clothes to accentuate said features.


Women notice a man's status (on top of 'would I fuck him or not, nice jaw-line, nice ass, etc).  I've known plenty of women to say they noticed 'how well dressed a man is,' what kind of car he drives, etc first, but I've also known plenty of them to pretty much admit that their first thought was, "he's hot, I'd bone him."


I don't say this to reenforce any stereotypes, but let's say we were to go with the old-school sexism, than women are objects of ornamentation, and men are mere utility devices.  I'll be bold and just say, women notice status on top of physical desire and attraction, whereas, a man would fuck a hot woman even if she lived in a box, if he could ;) 




 Mind if I pick your brain?  Sure you say?  Cool.  Thank you :)


What did you think of all those manuscripts you read?  Earnestly, what were the biggest shortcomings?  Were a lot of them just amateur-ish and sloppy?  How many people do you think thought they had something great and original, but was really just redundant and lacking in creativity?  How many were just really bad writers (even if they had good ideas)?  What were the most consistent mistakes/problems you saw in the writing?  And how about in the story-telling itself?

And how about that one that got through - how good was that one?  What made it stand out?

Thanks in advance, if and when you have the time to answer :) 




 I agree, and it is the fundamental problem I see with this young, naive generation of what have been dubbed SJWs:  the over-simplification of complicated issues.  Without getting to far into that, I mean, once we chop it up, what do the numbers look like?

Ie., with random numbers: Out of 100 men, only 2 are gay.  Out of Those 100 men, only 20 are interested in writing, 18 of them straight, and both gay males want to be writers.  Out of the 18 straight writers, only 5 take it seriously enough to finish and submit work and commit to the discipline of a working writer, and out of those 5, maybe 1 or 2 are actually published?  And how would those stats look taking our sample of the 2% of gay men.  What if both gay writers just happened to be shitty writers and are never published?  I imagine those numbers are driven down even lower for trans people, because they are an even smaller percent of the population...


The point is, I don't think the "women only" approach simply because of, well, vagina, is a good solution or a workable answer.  Ideally, if women do want equality, this sort of thing would be based on merit, not because again:  vagina. 




 The problem is, after decades of being beaten over the head with it, "gender issues" and "gender inequality" has become synonymous with "women's issues."  Let's look at it from another angle:


Yes, gender inequality sucks, and it's rough that men are stronger, and thus they are the ones who have had to take all the back-breaking jobs since we were monkeys, and that is the reason that most dangerous jobs are dominated by men to this day, and why armies have always been primarily comprised of men, ready for the slaughter.  What I'm getting at is, gender is more than a social construct, and it was defined and refined by both biological limitations and abilities.  It wasn't some conspiracy by the great patriarchy of man to elevate men at the expense of women, after all, all sane societies protected women, as they were the only ones who could make babies.  Sure, the field of writing has been historically dominated by men (as has the Earth in general), but feminism is just fighting for a reason to justify its existence in the modern, western world these days.  Continually treating women like children, and letting them win just because, well, vagina, serves only to patronize them, and takes us backwards in what they have fought so long and hard for:  equality.  And equality should exist where it can exist, but not necessarily forced down our throats, especially at the detriments of others. 




 Yep.  Women are always the passive voice, and men are always the active voice.  The only answer is to (continually) silence the men, since women are like children and should be treated as such.  /s 




 I heard that the publishing industry was dominated by women nowadays?  From editors to agents to authors... ?


Edit - To expand and explain a more important point, doesn't the world continually treating women like children only serve to further the equality gap and patronize women?  I mean, this falls under that dated notion of *men are the active voice, agents of change, and females are the passive voice, perpetual victims or objects to be acted upon*?  And isn't the point of being a strong woman demonstrating that for yourself, rather than doing it by removing the competition or letting you win for no other reason than vagina? 




 Bingo!

It brings to mind another saying, something along the lines of *"Any idiot can tough out a crisis, but it's the day-to-day stuff that wears you out."*  I think Borris Shmirnoff or Tommy Wisseau said it :D 




 IMO, if it feels like filler, and it reads as boring or too far removed or disengaging, or superfluous, then it probably is filler, and should be deleted or rewritten.  That, or just condense your stories.  Reading stories with filler like that is like eating that cheap "chocolate chip ice cream" that is mostly vanilla.  I feel cheated and annoyed afterwards, if I can even stomach it.  Worth asking - if you are bored or uninterested in writing or editing it, why wouldn't a reader be bored reading and digesting it?  When I read what I view as a solid story, I typically never think of any of it as filler.  (Same thing goes for movies and TV).


That being said, if it keeps you writing, rather than staring at a blank screen, then I'd say keep it up, especially because you never know when some idea that starts as filler could be developed and spun into gold, or at the least, replaced or deleted all together in lou of something more relevant, or preferably, no filler at all.  As others have said, there could be bits of history or story or character related points that could be used as well instead of 'filler,' so long as it flows naturally enough.


What has helped me most through the years has been to plot my stories out more concisely, especially if they are longer.  I don't necessarily or preferably need to know every single twist and turn, but I do need a solid bridge from A to Z.  Having some wiggle room has always been good too, as I've often had secondary ideas and plot supplant the originals, but everyone is differenct.


In short, to me the ideal story doesn't feel like it has any filler.  Form and style and genre don't matter in this, so long as it is crafted and constructed and strung together beatifully.
 




 I am a big fan of impressions (especially combined with small actions) over a writer trying to model a 3D face and body in my head, but each has its time and place depending on the writer and the story, but I definately agree with you on the specific height/weight descriptions with numbers.  I mean, we do make a zillion unconscious snap judgments in our head in the span of a second when we meet someone, but it never involves such mathematical specifics.  In general, I find that impressions vs. descriptions often fall under the whole 'less is more' idea, and depending on the genre, I often prefer it.


I recently described a prostitute along the lines of "a gutter-gaunt brunette, with long hair that vined across her face and spidery eye lashes flung over painted eyes set above a sharp nose and her plump rose-bud mouth" or something like that.  I was basically aiming for cracked out peacock, a withering painting of nature itself.  Something along those lines. 




 I enjoy both wildly detailed, more traditional literary ramblings, but I also appreciate the short and terse descriptions, especially when they exemplify "saying more with less."  I think it just depends on the writer and the story.  


I read a short story recently, with the focus on being a 'nobody/anonymous/little guy' so to speak, and the writer never even really described the character or named him, and among a few other odds and ends, it really served to cement the notion of being anonymous and over-looked and confined to one's headspace. 




 Yes, I win!  Wait, FUUUUUUUUU! 




 Who the hell is that anyhow?  I'm all like, hello random good-looking, generic tattooed guy :D 




 That's the point of this subreddit :D 




 Ah, ok.  None of the edits were there when I first saw this :) 




 LOL.  Thanks for sharing. 




 Wait, what?  You received brain surgery?  Or gave another student brain surgery? 




 TIL that teachers of young children are some of the dumbest motherfuckers out there... 




 LOL 




 Yeah.  They are well-intentioned idiots, but idiots nonetheless.  I do think a lot of it is fed by the more modern helicopter-parenting climate, but that is a whole nother issue in and of itself.  Think about it - whole new generations of liberal and progressive parents, teaching their children to feel guilty over their existence, 'entitlement' shame for any hard-earned 'privelage,' and then battering them with the never-ending list of 'women's issues,' because men are expected to take whatever bull-shit life throws at them, and as if we haven't been beaten over the head with the club of women's issues our entire lives.  I don't know where you are from friend, but in my country, the social-political climate is ripe with idiots and ignorance :D


Here is a good introductory video into their bizaare world.  The man critiquing it is actually quite sensible and reasonable, even about issues he doesn't necessarily care for, though his approach is one of satire and sarcasm.  Since you might not be familiar with the format of some of his videos, the girl in the SJW video is presenting what she sees as the issues, then answering said issues in a snarky, sarcastic manner, and in turn, Sargon cuts through the veil of bull-shit and translates it to the root of what they are saying.  He's really good at pointing out people's ignornace.  Enjoy  :)

 Yeah, my girlfriend (brutal plant killer and eater that she is), is in a similar boat as you in trying to go full vegan.  She mentioned seeing someone else being ripped apart in a vegan forum for mentioning that they didn't consider mussels animals due to their lack of a brain and nevous system or whatever, and thus mussels are more akin to plants, but every asshole vegan in the house jumped down their throat because obviously said person was worse than Hitler and Hipsters combined.  Case in point, an interesting read (even though I don't care much for the incessant, redundant vegan propoganda that precedes 99% of Vegans out there; they wear that shit like a smug cloak of moral superiority):

 Social Justice Warriors.  AKA, naive children from Candyland who want to blanket the world in protective foam, because they don't understand that the world aint fair, and that adversity is key to the human experience, as it brings growth, understanding, and maturity. 




 Yes.  Nothing says pretension like *"SLAAAAAAAAAAAYERRRRRR!" \m/ \m/* 




 Every and any student ever at a Liberal College. 




 Hahaha.  I remember that joke.  I originally saw it in print in an interview from way back in the 90's, but it was also reissued in Revolver's TOOL-only issue a few years after 10,000 Days dropped.


The band has a restraining order on me and I am no longer allowed to visit the Caduceus Vineyards.  Also, I tattooed TOOL on my forehead.  Top that you pretentious Tool fan! 




 Hahaha.  That was a great series, huh?  What did you think over-all?  I'm dissapointed that people like Cole don't actually exist in the world and talk and act like that, but they made him believable enough within the show.  


Ahem, but the point remains - just because we're made from the same muck doesn't mean we are all equal.  Let's let character and integrity and actions and words determine that, and be the only true judge.  Also, fuck egalitarianism :P
