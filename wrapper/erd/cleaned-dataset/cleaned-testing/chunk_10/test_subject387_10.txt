 beautiful comment 




 Yeah, how the hell would that work in real life? 




 Crazy how he went from a young cocky prick to a mature war-veteran with a traditional view of justice. 




 What the hell is with Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson always being in movies together? Not that I'm complaining. I'm assuming they've fucked at some point. 




 Eyeeeee want it thaaahat way. 




 Eyeeeee want it thaaahat way. 




 Ain't nothing but a heartache. 




 I saw the trailer, I haven't seen it. Not quite sure if it's even gotten a US release yet but, to be quite honest, I'm not into "back in the age" martial arts films with swords and etc.

When I think of Jackie Chan, I think of modern martial arts action-comedy movies. [For example, this scene from "Who Am I" is one of my favorites.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ5oaBWYzPk)

I've also noticed a lot of American movies getting better and better with their martial arts choreography. [Most notable one for me was this scene from Captain America: The Winter Soldier.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHh0XaW0UyQ)

[Have you seen Every Frame a Painting's video about Jackie Chan's action-comedic style?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ) Great video. 




 That said, I enjoyed the Chris Pratt mixtape thing.

Honestly, the only redeeming factor of the movie for me. 




  The problem is though the dogs tended to get scared and run back to their masters...with the bomb.

lol'd 




 Step Brothers.

I don't think it's *that* funny yet people in my city quote it like it's the comedy movie of the century.

"IT'S THE FUCKING CATALINA WINE MIXER"

Okay...

 Can't wait!! 




 Watch gaming videos... I spend a lot of time on Reddit and YouTube nowadays because it makes me feel like I'm not alone even if I physically am if that makes sense. 









 Context please. Was it about fatpeoplehate? 




 What the fuck is with all the top deleted comments? Context please.

 Gotcha, thank you. And yeah I had no idea what an indie game was or what "indie label" music meant until now. I mean, I'm assuming it means the same for "indie label" music, right? 




 Fuck, I just made a big comment describing this scene before I found that you already replied with the link. 




 Reminds of the scene in Enter the Dragon where a bully Martial Artist challenges Bruce Lee on the ship. He questions Lee's style of fighting to which Lee claims his style is, "The Art of Fighting Without Fighting." The Bully challenges Lee and boasts that he can defeat his style to which Lee says that they need more room. Lee points to an island and  suggests they take one of the smaller boats from the ship to ride out there. As the bully climbs down to the boat, Lee releases the line and the bully is trapped in the boat off the ship where he can no longer bully the people on the ship.

The Art of Fighting Without Fighting. 




 You're fucked. Have an upvote.

 sounds like a /r/nosleep story  




 whoa thought that was gonna be a /r/nosleep story  




 What exactly is an "indie game" btw? 




 Thank you, friend. I will check it out. 




 Oh shit. 









 Hi-Five! did the same thing here ;) 




 That's extremely inconvenient. I'm sorry to hear that but I hope you enjoy your game. 




 B-But Charmander gets Metal Claw. 




 Why the hell did you delete your account? 




 that fucking yawn. 




 YES! So that is why you must price match from Target at Walmart. But I agree, that policy is bullshit. 




 Do you remember what time in the video? 




 Unfortunately the register girl was a dumbass when I went and told me they don't price match against their own prices so I brought up Target's prices for ORAS. Still $29.99 but the fact that I had to do that and the fact that Walmart has two different price tags for the same item is bullshit. The girl probably didn't know the correct policy on that too because the guy working the electronics section told me it was fine if I price matched from their website so long as it was the same item. 

Wanted to post this comment as soon as you posted yours but Reddit's comment delay timer bullshit mechanic prevented me from doing so. 




 The only reason I can think of is because Wi-Fi distribution events are inconvenient for them. They hardly ever do Wi-Fi events. We live in a generation where you can distribute an event to anyone with Wi-Fi access and they still make us go pick something up "in-store." 




 Fantastic!!!

Oh, no. I asked my dad and apparently the Macbook Pro w/Retina doesn't have a LAN port because it is Wi-Fi only :( 

So I guess that means I would have to buy an adaptor of some sort?  




 Thank you, friend. 




 so op lied 




 wtf cant tell if srs 




 No, if you go to Walmart and buy it - it costs $39.99... 




 Did "./relaymyhome full" from there and got this http://i.imgur.com/p2h7oP4.png

I'm assuming everything went well and all I need to do is to connect my Macbook Pro w/Retina Display to a LAN Cable which is also connected to my Router while my N3DS is in sleep-mode and I will receive Eon Ticket via Street Pass? :D


ALSO btw, why does Homepass keep turning my Wi-Fi on and off?

EDIT: Going to sleep now. Will reply when I wake up. very tired. I appreciate your help so much. You didn't have to do this. Thank you for everything /u/sirence9 




 Oh no problem thank you! I corrected it here. What next?

 Okay! What next? http://i.imgur.com/OEneeKg.png

 Wait, how could she have seen that??? 




 Wait, she turned around? I didn't see her turn around at all. 




 Wait what do you mean? 




 Come on Dudley. 




 What's with Japan and Upskirts? No one wears skirts where I'm from unless they're doing a play or some kind of western event. 




 Yes friend! What next? http://i.imgur.com/XtkdDAe.png 




 No but seriously, what's with Traditional Martial Arts and their EMPHASIS on Wrist control for self-defense? 




 Why the hell are you training with fellow students, and allowing other students to train each other when they have not received permission from the master to either teach, or lead a class?

It's not a crime to practice with other students outside of class.

 Here are screenshots of both the "ls" in termianl  and the network name. The security is also set to none, last time I checked. How can i confirm though?

Thank you very much for all your help!! If you could just guide me through the program mechanics so I can do this correctly via Terminal, by tomorrow morning I can ask my dad for the LAN Cable so I can maybe make this work :) 




 What's the difference beteween the basic Taekwondo Roundhouse Kick and a "Kickboxing" Roundhouse Kick? 


Very little if any. The misconception here is that Taekwondo, Karate, Muay Thai, Kickboxing, etc. etc. all are completely different which is not necessarily true. Yes, their are slight differences in mechanics due to each sport having their own ruleset. 

WTF Sport Taekwondo, for example, scores kicks via contact with the Instep of the Foot. Taekwondo kicks also, mostly, all start from the chamber position and end chambering back whereas Muay Thai Roundhouse kicks, for example, swing and hit with the ~~instep~~ shin being a "full-contact" sport that doesn't have a focus on points.

However, the proper, basic mechanic of the kick - turning your hips, hand positioning, etc. for all styles should all be very similar. We have several guys that crosstrain in Muay Thai and Kickboxing at my Taekwondo Dojang and one of my Masters used to compete in Thai Boxing competitions back in Asia so I'm speaking from my own personal experience - not just theories pulled out of my butt.

Semantics aside, the basics are the same. If this guy can't perform a proper "TKD form kick," I would definitely question his credibility as a decent "kickboxer." 

EDIT: Just my two cents.

EDIT: For the sake of my example above, I was referring to the basic Roundhouse Kick.

EDIT: Meant shin not instep. corrected it 




 Why's that? 




 Keep us updated on your situation, OP. Hope things turn out for the better. 




 OH, I haven't been connecting my Mac with my router via LAN Cable. Not sure how to do that or what a LAN Cable is or if I even have one.

But I'm assuming I should use USB Ethernet then? That sounds correct, right?

Anyways, I went along with the rest of the steps and there's no directory found:

EDIT: As you can see I clicked on USB Ethernet and selected Wi-Fi 




 You know that Jun Fan is just Bruce Lee's Chinese name, right? Li Xiaolong was his nickname/stagename but "Jun Fan" is not a style - it's his Chinese Name. Bruce, not having fully learned the Wing Chun system at the time when he moved to the US, opened up a school and dubbed it "Jun Fan Gung Fu" where he taught the Wing Chun concepts he did know along with his own mix of styles he practiced outside of Wing Chun. 




 added 2 edits to my latest reply. 




 1. Internet Sharing - http://i.imgur.com/k2VxSdM.png
[I selected both Ethernets to be safe]

2. Have Relaymyhome folder in Documents and access it through Terminal with the commands they tell you in the instructions in order. 
http://i.imgur.com/7GRfWdt.png

3. Nothing works.

4. Try just accessing the folder by clicking and activating homepass manually. http://i.imgur.com/jUzqeO5.png

5. Nothing is working still. But it looks like it's running.

EDIT: So, what did I do wrong?

EDIT2: Using the alternative method by accessing it without terminal makes it run without anything working. I'll get through several cycles with nothing. No streetpasses whatsoever. And my Street pass for Buzz Nav is definitely on for Omega Ruby. 




 Okay, you know what I'm going to do? I will screenshot and send you every step I'm doing so you can tell me what I'm doing wrong. 




 It's okay. I've tried both. Like I said, maybe it's just me. I'm running OS X Yosemite 10.10.1 on a Macbook Pro w/Retina Display.

Maybe the problem is I'm not using terminal at all to navigate. I just go straight to relaymyhome folder and click on the program and activate it from there and it runs like this (you can see me go straight to the folder and clicking on it in the background) http://i.imgur.com/jUzqeO5.png

Theoretically it should work the same but nothing's working and I've tried for a few hours. So I'm giving up. Thank you. 














 Never heard of that before. Was it popular at one point? 




 I got two Japanese Hoopas yesterday legit with Ribbons. 




 So, basically nothing special. 




 Thank you very much for your help so far, by the way. 




 No problem. You realize you can screenshot through your Mac, right? Cmd + Shift + 4.

Anyways, I have two Ethernet options, I'm not sure which one to use that is my problem http://i.imgur.com/DrCLCzB.png

See? There's Display Ethernet and USB Ethernet, no just "Ethernet" option. 




 It's doing this. I went straight to the folder and clicked on and activated homepass without using Terminal. http://i.imgur.com/kXoZ3Gr.png


No streetpasses have been detected. Do I need a USB Ethernet or whatever the hell that is? I'm using a Macbook Pro.

 




 After I use ./relaymyhome full it just says

./relaymyhome full
-bash: ./relaymyhome: is a directory


it doesn't run. and when i try to just use the relaymyhome exec from the folder, it just keeps running and running without anything happening. could you please give me specific step to step on how you did this? I'm following the step to step there but they leave things out and it's bothering me because I'm not doing it correctly. I don't know how to use terminal.  




 I've tried using that tutorial too. But there's Two Ethernet Options and so far it hasn't been working for me. Idk if I'm doing it properly. Which Ethernet Option should I use? USB Ethernet or Display Ethernet?? 




 Stuck on Step 4. http://i.imgur.com/3lLXSMK.png

No "Wi-Fi Options button." And I'm assuming you meant select Internet Sharing from the "Pull-Down Menu" in Sharing from System Preferences. 




 The Wi-Fi Options button in the Sharing Menu doesn't pop up for the "Wi-Fi" "share your source from" option. 




 Also where is the Wi-Fi Options button from the Sharing Menu? 




 Thank you for your comment. Where can I download this MBA? And how do I find MAC addresses of Spotpass locations? 




 If I trade my 3DS original in for a N3DSXL via the Gamestop Promotion, will I lose my Ambassador Program games?

 I want to get the Eon Ticket for Omega Ruby. :(

Please help. I've been following this guide but I think it's outdated and doesn't work https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/2nk7f1/scriptosx_easiest_method_to_get_eon_ticket/ 




 Can you still use Homepass to get the Eon Ticket if you recently updated your 3DS? And if so, how? 

EDIT: For Mac please. 




 Are you trolling or is it really? 




 DUDE. Those are really small Gorillas. 




 Is this real? 




 Wow those are magnificent.  




 Yes!! 




 Wait, why did I get downvoted? I just liked his comment.

 Yup in Book 1 he said he'd never firebend again and on the cover of book 3 - he's firebending. 









 TAKE-HOME LAPTOPS THAT CAN GO ON REDDIT. That's a nice school you go to. And yeah, I get you on the time wasted part! Reddit is the bane of college students. 




 Bruh, this black guy literally brought a fucking radio and played that shit loud as hell without earphones/headphones in the gym. I've never seen someone so dgaf before in my life. 




 That's fucking crazy. I'm never eating breakfast again... oh wait, I don't already. 




 Lol, dude. That's what happened to me too. 




 I mean, there's a dubbed version of the first movie in Blu-Ray I believe. 




 Woah those are some really small tits. Nice though. 




 Did her tits get bigger? 




 Dude, thanks! Fapfapfapfapfap 














 So is it fake? 




 I'm just trying to find the most vague description ever that could be any film on this thread. 




 Wait, I forgot. What happened in Supercop? Unless you were referring to the old man with the fake boobs...

I know he grabbed a girls' tits while fighting her in one movie. Wasn't Supercop though.

EDIT: Not talking about Rush Hour either. He was fighting a group of tall black girls.

 This guy carried a 3.9 GPA in University and graduated with the highest honors. Quoted as a great group leader and had mature academic work. What the hell happened... he seemed like he had a bright future.

 I was thinking about watching that. Is it not good?

I remember the Pre-Time Skip filler arc with Naruto and Sasuke like episode "The Worst Three-Legged Race" was really entertaining and funny. 




 I came. 




 Source!? 




 Will definitely do. I will tell me instructor, straight-up, that I will refuse to have a match with this student again until he purchases arm guards along with shin   instep guards. I'm tired of clashing elbows and shins with this guy. He's a grown man too. 




 Will definitely do. Thanks for the tip.

It's frustrating how something so small can leave a big impact on your body.  Feels like I still need to take a few days off practice. 




 Roundhouse Kicks. One of my sparring partners doesn't wear arm guards and keeps his guard down to his sides. Sometimes I get unlucky and catch and elbow since the Roundhouse Kick hits the sides of his body. I ended up limping on my left foot so I couldn't move properly and just did checking motions until he came in and I caught him with a Spinning Hook Kick with my right foot. 




 The guy I was sparring wasn't using arm guards. And I can't imagine that you'll ever get used to the pain of having a roundhouse kick connect with the instep right on your opponent's elbow. Every time that's happened to me - it puts me out for a few days to a week due to the bruising.  I iced it last night and took ibuprofen but I can hardly walk still.  Hurts to put weight on it. 




 I do wear instep guards. The Adidas Shin + Instep pads. Still hurts like hell when you roundhouse kick someone's flank when they have arm down and you hit their elbow.

 By all estimates I've seen, Pokemon XD did worse, critically and financially, than XD.

Wait what? Pokemon XD did worse than XD?


But yeah, I guess I agree with what you're saying. To maximize profit, they should just pour their efforts into what they know will sell and if it means shutting down production of more home console RPGs, so be it.  It's nice that they do take the successful story elements from them to add to the main handheld games, though.

 I never took Carrie as a serious Robin/character, to be honest. Her character design along with those big goggles/glasses looks like Velma from Scooby Doo in Robin cosplay.
