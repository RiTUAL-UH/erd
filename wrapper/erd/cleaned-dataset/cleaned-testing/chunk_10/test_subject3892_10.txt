 Samesies. Although while reading a few of the side stories you can tell which ones were left on the cutting room floor. I liked them, but if I were an editor I can see why you'd cut those if you were forced to chop down some pages. They didn't really contribute to the overall story, but they were fun in their own, dark way.  




 How was it? I've danced around the idea of starting this for quite some time.  




 The imagery at the end was just inciredble. All the dancing and the scene with the bear and just complete and utter chaos. For the judge, it was very much a God-like moment for him. It was his world and you were lucky to be alive in it. He knew it, felt totally in control, and was comfortable enough to dance like a maniac in light of all these revelations. 




 Exactly. And look how it worked out for him.  




 Thanks for the feedback. This was actually my very first book by him. I do have "All the Pretty Horses" and "The Crossing" as well, all of which were fantastic finds at a recent library sale. 

I rarely ever read two books in a row from the same author and I may need a little palette cleanser after this one, but I can definitely see myself tackling one of those in the not-so-distant future.  




 Hey, even Babe Ruth set the original home run record on a healthy diet of hot dogs and beer. Sometimes it just works.

Of course, slugging lumber and jogging around the bases is completely different than hockey, but I digress. 

The point is, there is something magical about hot dogs. For me, excessive gas and a trip to the vomitorium. For Gretzky and Ruth, success in different forms.  




 Just finished this tonight. At times it was a bit verbose, other times beautifully on point, and finally it ended with what can only be described as Heart of Darkness meets the Wild West.

I loved it. Having spoken to a number of people about this one I've discovered that everyone interprets the ending differently. And to that point, even McCarthy won't go so far as to say exactly what happened.

If you've read it I'd love to hear your two cents.  




 They're often times fairly uneventful. If anything most of the controversy comes in seeing who teams don't protect from the expansion list or where the definitive "journeyman" lands. Then when he gets drafted by an expansion team devout fans go nuts until they watch him phase out on a struggling team. 

Just look at the 2000 Draft. Jim Dowd, Joey Juneau, Lyle Odelein. All guys who did their time, and then some.

 Considering how well soccer has done out there I would love to see a team in Portland. That would be one hell of a scene.

And that's coming from someone who has never been to the city.  




 Do we see a return of the Nordiques along with the inception of the Las Vegas High Rollers? 




 Yeah, still under construction. I believe they're targeting 2016 on that.  




 Directions unclear. Both pinkies now broken.  




 That entire sequence was just outrageous. His mind went blank but his body relied on instinct. Any time I watch that scene I still can't believe he went the distance, let alone earned the win.  




 Not for Bradley. No way he takes this fight again. The damage was done in that first one and I think he knows he only has so many more rounds left in him. Provodnikov is too big a risk.  




 "Wlady, I'm hooooome."  
"Give me a second. These old legs don't move as fast as they used to."  
*German canned laughter*  
"Oh Wlady, what am I going to do with you?"  
"You can start with a warm embrace."  
"Oh Wlady. Did I ever tell you you give the best hugs?"  
"Yah. And so did 67 other guys."  
*German canned laughter*   




 That was a work of art. Bravo, Fury. 

I really hope this turns out to be a good one.  




 This photo is so old that upon seeing the total number of upvotes she received on the original post, this woman was inspired to go to school for her piloting license, began her flying career, took a few years off to raise a family, went back into the air, flew a record 25 million miles around the world, retired, watched her grandkids on the weekends, died peacefully surrounded by loved ones and is currently reincarnated as OP in a vain attempt to get more upvotes for the photo that started it all.  




 I don't think we have to question Donaire's abilities. I think we have to question his heart. If his heart is in it, if he's committed to the sport and to fitness, he's a top contender against any of those guys. What we've seen in recent fights is that he's just not into it like he was two or three years ago.  




 I love that he owns a pizza truck. That's fantastic. 

Outside of that he seems to be a man of few words, but likely because English isn't his first language.  




 Like they say, you can't spell Klitschko with "schko."

 I didn't know this up until a few years ago when a teammate kicked it and I, thinking the play was dead, just caught the ball and tossed it back to the other side. Imagine my surprise and disappointment.  




 Meh 




 A different time, different technology and a different sport, but something like that almost happened in the 60s to the (then) Minnesota Lakers.

The NBA did a really great in-depth piece on it on the 50th anniversary a few years back.

We've seen it happen in the KHL to Lokomotiv and even at the college level with Marshall, but hopefully we never have to see it again, regardless of sport or division. Scary stuff.  




 Dark. Laughed, but dark. haha
