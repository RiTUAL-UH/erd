 Thank you.  You, my friend, are on the level. 




 How would I tell?  A lithograph would have indentations, right?  Any other telltale signs? 




 Thank you.  For real. 




 Hah, got it, needed a tiny Alan wrench.

Nothing!  Wha...? 




 See the second picture I posted.  

I have no idea how to remove the backing without busting the glass.  Should I just bust it? 




 If only the gnomes were in a more Gravity Falls style...http://imgur.com/pMd9hNr 




 Holy crap.  My brain did not even go that direction with it.  It was custom framed.  I've never seen a frame like this.  Apparently, the framer didn't want their name attached. http://imgur.com/Wkz8uIA 









 I have had sleep paralysis issues for nine years now. Typically, the dreams that end with the paralysis involve something horrifying (being thrown around a room or stalked by something unseen).  Those suck.

Three nights ago, I had the first one in two years.  It was a dream within a dream within a dream.  I remember waking up twice only to find that it wasn't quite over.

I felt my hand sting.  Then it started to really hurt.  I was on my back, so I pulled my hand to my line of sight.  Expecting a cramp or my hand to have been asleep, I peered down towards my hand to find a deformed, hairless head with its mouth wrapped around my hand, up to my thumb. The body wasn't visible, and I can still remember the expressions it was making while it chomped down.

Then the paralysis!  Finally, I woke up with a yelp.  A literal yelp.  I had fallen asleep with a paintbrush in hand.  I had clenched so tightly onto it in my sleep that my hand cramped.  Weird.
