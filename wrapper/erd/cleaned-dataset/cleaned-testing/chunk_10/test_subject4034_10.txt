 That is pretty cool  




 Sorry, that would make sense. My parents came back from overseas and bought me a back a t shirt. They still left the magnetic security tag on it so I was wondering where to get a magnet capable of releasing the tag.  




 Hey I know this is an old thread but would that be a decent place to discuss getting into that sort of thing. I want to do some game dev, even as a fun hobby but it's very overwhelming when you look up how to start this. Some first hand experience would be cool to talk to  




 Hey bit of a random request but does anyone know where I could buy a magnet from in Newcastle. 




 I am using a 1Tb WD Passport external hard drive and my OS is windows 7 64bit.
My hd will be registered by the computer, i will be able to safely remove ect.
However in Windows Explorer the device will show up but not under its proper name and as soon as I click on it Windows Explorer crashes. When i open the computer management tool and click on disk management it freezes until I pull the hard drive then everything works perfectly again. Same with disk defragmenter.
Is there a way I can fix this hard drive without reformatting it or a way I can recover the 500Gb of data off it and then reformat or throw the friggin thing away?

Any help is greatly appreciated. 




 It was done as a joke. The bloke with the ball (Willie Mason) use to play for the Knights (white red and blue team). 
Bit of harmless on field shenanigans.  




 Yeah cheers for that. I might head there tomorrow and see what he can do. 




 I haven't removed it from the enclosure but I did swap the connector. The issue is that the computer registers that the drive has been plugged into it, I can safely remove hardware ect, but windows explorer cannot open the drive nor can I use any of the data. So I figured a reformat is in order however there is a solid 600Gb of content that I really dont want to lose.

Cheers for the suggestion however I might give them a look. 




 Damn. It's a frustrating problem hey because you can't just get in and defrag it or something. 

If I find a solution I'll post back with the details. 




 My external hard drive has stopped being able to be read from any of my computers and there are alot of Movies and TV shows (legally bought of course)  that I would like back. 

Does anyone know of a good data recovery place that could get everything back from drive or even transfer the data to a fresh non munted hard drive? 




 Give Adamstown and Kotara a look as well. Decent affordability and they are smack bang in the middle the 2 main shopping centres. Plus only 15 Min drive from the beach.  




 Yeah the new ANZAC walk near bar Beach is unreal. Such an amazing view.  









 Ha saw that at work today. Classic. That building is a leak hazard  




 One overall touristy post about all the things to do in newy so we can eliminate the constant "hey travelling or moving up to Sydney, what are some cool things to do" posts.  




 I am so so glad that you posted this. I'm glad someone else is as worried about the thought of this stupid policy getting through. I don't think people understand how much of a violation it is. 

I will absolutely sign this see what other actions can be taken.
