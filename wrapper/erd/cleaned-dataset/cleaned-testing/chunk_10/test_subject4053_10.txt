 Note: This is a short, spoopy story that my 13 year old sister wrote and gave me permission to share. It's her first story and she's aspiring to be a writer when she gets out of school o3o. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I hear a strange, blaring noise intrude it's way into my still-unconscious mind,it's only as my mind begins to wake, do my ears register the noise as my alarm clock. 

Panic floods my body as I look at the clock and it's still screaming alarm. 7:30, I slept in.

I put on the clothes from last night, and rush downstairs to get something to eat, something quick or I'll be late for school. 

"Good morning, honey!" A voice greets as I fumble down the stairs and rush through the living room and into the kitchen. 

"Good morning mom" 
I call back. 

I grab a pack of cherry poptarts, grab my backpack and rush out the front door, bursting through it, just in time to barely catch the school bus as it's pulling away from the stop next to my house. 

I drone my way through another day of school and catch the bus back home at the end of the day. 

"Welcome home, honey!"
My mothers voice greeted as a walked through the door. 

"Hi"
I reply before retreating up the stairs. 

I do my homework and play a few hours of video games before bed, ignoring my mothers new and horrid taste in music that she's blaring as I do. 

I jump in the shower and get ready for bed around 10pm, when my cellphone rings. 

"Hello?"
I answer

"Charlene?"
the womans voice replies from the other end
"I just wanted to let you know that your father and I are coming home early and will be back tomorrow morning"


I don't answer my mother as my eyes dart towards my door, my name is called from the hallway. Whatever is standing in front of my door, it's not my mother.  




 As far as I know, just bad housing market. The house is at the very end of a long dead end road and away from pretty much everything. So probably not a very good location for a lot of people. 

I don't particularly like the location either, but the house was a cheap sale xD. 




 So, I recently moved into a new house, after my old house flooded due to a faulty water pipe, which my landlord refused to fix. 

Anyway, it's a nice house, was well kept, despite having been empty for almost 10 years, and it has a nice, big fenced in yard for my dog, so, win-win. 

I've been here about two months, but for the last month, some weird shit has been going on. 

I've been plagued by weird dreams, not really scary, just bizarre. I'm no stranger to weird dreams, but these are really weird. 

The one I had two nights ago was the weirdest. In the dream, I'm standing out in the woods, and there's this little boy standing behind a tree in front of me and he looks at me and says "we're always watching". It wasn't a scary dream by any sense, the best I can describe as being kinda hazy, like I was shrouded in fog. I also woke up very tired, like I'd been walking all night. 

Both myself and my dog have heard things like pattering footsteps running across the hard wood floor in the dining room/kitchen(it's one big room separated by a center island table), or thumping up in the "attic", there is no attic really, it's just beams.   My dog is a very easy going dog, she's 6 years old and has *never* growled a day in her life. But when we first moved in, she would plant herself at the bottom of the stairs doing upstairs and growl. 


Not a terrifying turn of events, but definitely weird.  




 There is more proof that something still exists after you die than there is that you go to heaven. There is *no* proof of God, beyond a book and what Christians say, I've never seen God. 

Did I offend a poor little God person? =( 




 DEMON!

Dude, that's a stick

DEMON!

Dude...that's a dog


DEMON!

Dude! that's my girlfri-....nevermind, carry on.

Girlfriend: -_- 




 LOL this made me laugh harder than it should have. 

"We believe the voice in the recording is saying "I'll kill your soul"

*What the ghost is actually saying*

"Have you seen my nacho cheese?" 




 Oh, we don't like Douchey Baganses, precious. No we don't.

But seriously, he's a pompous asshat who treats his "friends" like shit. 


From what I've heard, he's also pretty much a fukwad to his fans too when he meets them.  




 Did you not see the part where I said I didn't know where to put it? =D

Maybe instead of saying "EHHHHHH IT NOT PARANORM!" You could have been like "hey, put this here =D" 




 Well, that's what happens when you're a violent paranoid Schizophrenic.

People tend to take you away.
