 I hate this too. Maybe some people assume that the theater is going to fill up anyway. They "don't see" the empty spaces - it doesn't factor into their decision making -  and instead just focus on where they want to sit. If that place is next to someone else... Even if it's *right next to them...* that's where they'll sit. 




 I was just wondering about this last night. Chrome was closed and yet because of having so many instances it was still the most resource-intensive thing running on the computer. 




 You're exactly right. The reason they push those specs are because management won't sign off on buying anything without them. It's the language that the rules are written in.

Another thing is that just because it can pass, say, a drop test does not mean that it *will* withstand a drop. Or a slide on concrete. Or having a heavy toolbox set on top if it. 




 How was this an appropriate response? The thread went,

"What are all these flowers for?"

"People died. This is their memorial."

"Dude check out the rack on the florist." 




 Deadly. I wonder if they'll figure it out now. 




 Whew you guys are obviously great for each other.

If there was one thing I would change about this it would definitely be to take out about 100 commas. 




 When I was a sophomore in high school I bussed tables and did prep work for a restaurant in a small coastal town. The restaurant was in what they called a"downtown" which was a little strip of restaurants, bars and knick-knack tourist shops that went along a river. I worked there with another hostess named Lisa for a few months and then she left. She didn't quit, she just didn't come to work anymore.

About a year ago, I saw Lisa again. I was 24 and bartending two blocks down the street from the restaurant we worked at. She didn't look the same. She was older, more beautiful. She looked put-together. Her makeup was bold but perfect, not a hair out of place.

Something about her, maybe her eyes or the way she puckered her lips to take a drink... I could barely look away. I don't remember anything from the last hour of my shift except that when she tried to pay for a drink, the bills she pulled from her bra were damp and slick.

She waited without making me ask while I cleaned the bar. Teddy said he'd take care of the tills and we left.

Lisa was terrible at walking in heels. Slow, and lilting, it looked like it was her first time. I held her up and kept her from falling over. I could feel a gym body through her clothes and I couldn't say whether it was me or her that was sweating.

She took a sudden right turn away from the main street that threw me off guard. Toward the pier and the river.

"Where are you going?" I asked.

"I want to see the water," she said. "Walk with me?"

We walked next to the sail and fishing boats on the pier. She led me to the unstable floating walkway that went under the pier. I stopped and she pulled away.

"Hey, come on," I said. "Let's go home."

"Just a little more," she said and she didn't look back. The last thing I saw of her was that lilted, tottering walk as she slipped into the darkness under the wooden, barnacled pier.

I waited for her. I couldn't bring myself to leave the lighted area though. Every time I'd set so much as a toe into the dark, the hairs on my neck would stand up. I must have sat for fifteen minutes arguing with myself. I never heard her or anyone for that matter.

In the end, I just left.

I thought that was it. Sometimes I honestly had to wonder whether it even really happened at all.

I left that town to finally go to college. Better late than never, right?

Anyway, last night I got a text from one of my old bartender buddies, Jesse. He asked if I knew this girl and sent me a blurry picture of Lisa. This morning his girlfriend asked if I'd seen or heard from him. She said he just disappeared last night.

Tell me it's all in my head. Make me feel okay. 




 Oof. Really left me hanging.

Also, "stoo it?" Should that be "Stop it?" 









 That's not even really creepy or scary... It just makes me mad. 




 I think they were talking more about people negotiating raises than the PB. 




 As long as they're of age. 




 That was cute. 




 That's what I mean, though. If a burp is air escaping, then why is there so much air just sitting there. If I do jumping jacks is all of that just splashing around? It doesn't look right to me unless they inflated the stomach to get a better view with the camera. 




 [Hm...](http://img.pandawhale.com/64932-That-doesnt-make-any-sense--Pa-p7m4.gif) 




 Someone needs to teach ~~her~~ it a lesson. 




 How do you feel about /u/AWildSketchAppeared? 




 Oh my god 10/10 for the boobs alone. 




 What are the top three things that happened or that you did today? 




 In saying, "I reddit," I wonder what the best scenario you pictured happening was. 




 I'll have you know that on mobile I got that in one try. 




 This is it. Taste drives creativity. How many times have you complained that the ending of this sucked or that they could have done ___ better? So do it better. 




 I can't even think of another way to interpret that... 




 Maybe the two phones should just commit, have a baby, and finally make everyone happy at once. 









 I can hear it. She's in the house. I'm hiding in my closet and *oh Jesus she won't stop.*

Eric.Harris.rocks.my.world. 




 You managed to write all that without calling them killer whales. Might have even been Bundy whales or Voorhees whales with,

for their livers. 




 Oh you're everywhere. 

I definitely approve of the method. Any cheap, scratch notebook recommendations? 




 To go with the idea of context being important, what about Jesse's "bitch?"

Yeah, he overuses it, but you still feel it when he's angry or happy. It doesn't detract from anything (in my opinion) because it seems realistic. 




 For a quick 'n dirty (and free) method, you could use Evernote. I'm not sure what kind of notes you have, but EN allows you to use a search function with your hand-written notes. It's cloud-based, mobile-friendly and versatile. You'll need a decent camera, but any smart phone from the last few years should do. 




 I like "anchor points." It's sometimes frustrating when something is written for one reason but readers interpret it differently, or don't seem get it at all. But you can't control everything like that. Maybe the reader isn't set up to be receptive to some ideas. Then again, maybe they're seeing things and making connections in your words that even you're not. You should "write for yourself" but putting it out there is still a bit of a vulnerable process. 

I like the idea of anchor points, though. As a reader, I look for those especially near the beginning. At some point near the middle or end, I usually have my mind made up. The ship is sailed, so to speak. 




 I personally love stories that wander. They live in realism and because of that they leave loose ends, characters and narrators are just plain wrong and the ending should never come but does eventually.

But not on nosleep. Not so much. There isn't time. I don't know or trust most of the writers here to pull that off. 




 Another thing to think about, the big question(s) of writing a story: **why?**

Why are you writing this story? What's the point of it? What are you trying to communicate?

And as far as I've thought about it, it's either a feeling or an idea. Nosleep praises feelings and sees idea stories as cheap, no matter how prettily they're wrapped. (Of course there are exceptions to every rule.)

So then every part, paragraph, sentence and word in a story should support that big thing somehow. Don't waste. Don't wander aimlessly. If you've got nothing to say, readers will know it.

Everything is true, right? So be honest in your writing. Say what you mean and tell it as well as you can. That's what makes a story good and that's why someone will listen. 




 Red flag. 




 I don't really know what I'd use it for. I adore that website's description though.

Sometimes, we just want our shit as orange as possible. 




 Heh. '69. 




 I saw them so clearly that at first it didn't occur to me that no one else had. A man, bending at the waist so as to speak over the hum of the crowd into the ear of the boy next to him. A boy, obviously crying, with his face drawn into a frown and his pleading eyes searching aimlessly. Most bizarrely of all though, from his limp hands hung a rifle.

It would have made a decent movie poster. Maybe one of those cardboard cutouts that come out with the newest summer blockbuster or video game release. There was a lot of emotion in that tiny scene across the food court. 

A picture says a thousand words, and this one told a story that was so at odds with the rest of the Saturday afternoon mall scene that I thought I must have been mistaken. I'm still in shock that I was the first one, the *only* one to see it. There were people closer than me. What was wrong with them? Why wasn't anyone else screaming?

The man sort of lifted the rifle for the boy, put his hand in the proper place, but you could tell that the youngster was used to shooting. He stuck his nose up against the slide and drew the stock tightly into his shoulder. He looked comfortable, but his face was still so afraid.

The man was still talking to him. Egging him on. Those searching eyes found mine and the world stood still.

Then everything was pain noise.

Looking back I think about those poor people. The ones who didn't make it. And it's tragic, it's terrible. It actually *hurts*  to know that they died.

But then, some other small voice keeps asking the question...

Why didn't they see them standing there? Why didn't they notice? Why was it only me? What was wrong with them? 




 [She's missed you too.](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/01/30/article-1351959-0CF9E029000005DC-396_468x727.jpg) 




 The center part is a turnbuckle. Holding both of the hooks in place and turning that middle piece will tighten both screws because of the reversed threads (on the left hook). If both hooks were attached to cables, it could be used to adjust tension on them.

As for the wood frame... I'm not exactly sure. 




 Why not make it a [threesome?](http://www.rationalitynow.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/633619816658263170-ceationism2.jpg) 




 https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/wiki/relatedlinks here's a list I made a while ago. 




 More nutty than ballsy. 




 I just want to take my laptop to the Chinese buffet and watch movies too. I feel like I'd get in trouble for some reason... 




 The over-exposure makes me feel for you. The world is too bright! 




 X-acto knife or box cutter. 




 So you're going to take pages out of your notebooks to put in the binders? Will you hole punch them?

And in the last sentence you said you're looking for a notebook that's compact like a notebook. Is that what you meant? 




 You should come back at night when he's sitting in the chair. 




 Sorry I thought you were responding to the other comment.

You're right, I made up the weights and tensions. It still didn't launch them like it normally would (not a "full launch"). 




 Depends on which country's edition you're playing. 




 Yeah that's... exactly what I said.

Edit: In my other comment. Obviously the numbers used here were rough estimates. 




 You can tell that it's made up because of the way that it is. 




 Thanks! I was really hoping you'd come back to it.

I think I'd have problems writing that too (and a few other things). I don't know if that makes it difficult to write about or just seldom worth it. 




 Any time, the same thing applies. Having one strap pull the cage up or side-to-side isn't so scary since all your potential pulling power is in those straps and you just lost half. The only real way you might run into trouble is if it broke right when you reached the top, in which case you'd have gravity working against you.

But it's also not true what you said about unpredictability. You can at least say that the bands are most likely to break at their maximum strain, which is when they're stretched at launch. After that point, they'll have less and less strain on them and will be less likely to break because of that.

So at the top of the arc, where things are the most dangerous, you just proved that the strap can hold at a higher tension a few seconds before. Since you lose momentum fighting gravity, the stress on them is lower now.

I guess you can't guarantee that it would never happen, but I think it's safe to say that most strap breaks would happen on the ground or just upon takeoff. 




 I don't think flair is a good way of going about this. You might, *at best*, end up with a style like /r/writingprompts. It would look complicated and confusing, it would be hard to implement for the (how many millions now?) people to post, enforcement would put a serious strain on the volunteer mods.

And that's just the *how* of it. The *what* was organizing stories by "genre." I personally can't see that being a good thing at all. All the stories on nosleep are true. You don't think that's going to detract from the realism if next to the title it says "vampire," "ghosts," or "bigfoot?" Half the stories here have some kind of twist. Sorting things into genres couldn't help that.

The thing is, nosleep stories already are a subsection of horror writing, and nosleep isn't a catch-all. It's actually pretty specific as far as writing subs go.

I'd like to hear your thoughts though. What did you have in mind? 




 As others have said, glue or otherwise attach a mini printed sheet to one of the pages. 




 full power launch

Nope. If you have 1000 pounds of lifting force with two bands, acting on a 500 pound cage and one band breaks, the thing isn't going anywhere. 




 Endings are hard and most of the time they're at least a little disappointing. What had the best first half even if the ending wasn't perfect?

Ninja edit: I'm mostly asking from a story or main plot point of view. Anything is good though. 




 What couldn't/can't you write in a story and why? 




 M real good at ritin. 

And by that I mean that I can sound out most words in my vocabulary. 




 Not enough CGI. 




 You're doing yourself a disservice to leave out Spartacus as well. 




 Yeah, you're not supposed to drink it (#4). 




 Yeah I'm surprised no one mentioned that yet. Towels are really invaluable.

 This was my first thought too. Everyone knows (or has known) at least one person. They stop caring, too. So you have a pulse? Let me tell you about whatever. Don't have a pulse? Even better; you can't get away.

 That's it! What are rubber buns though? 




 There's one I remember from the playground that ended with something something rubber buns and liquor (rub her buns and lick her) but I don't remember the joke and it didn't make sense at the time. I just remember rubber buns and liquor from time to time.

Does anyone know the joke? Do you have any jokes like this? 




 In the car works too... Not with headphones though. 




 I still can't listen to music with headphones on because I'll think i hear someone calling my name. It's been 7 years since I lived with my parents. 




 Directions unclear. Dick stuck in hood ornament.

 At retail and service jobs you've got to consider who you're actually talking to and following up with. A shift supervisor isn't making hiring decisions, but they might be the highest ranking person in the store at a given time and they might try to answer your questions.

It might seem obvious, but I can tell you that many young people don't know this. When I was a supervisor, I'd tell people they needed to call or visit during the few hours that the owner was actually present since they did the hiring... Most didn't. 




 What kind of book is that? Make sure you hide it well.

*Yeesh.*

 Good on you, glad to hear it. 




 Do you think maybe your friends are taking advantage of you? 




 Officials said they were investigating why wardens had failed to give Mr Barry a third ticket.

I know that it's totally suspicious, but I cracked up at this.

Warden: "Boss, I found someone dead in a double parked car."

Boss: "Well, did you give them a ticket?"

W: "N-no. They were dead and I didn't know what to do so I called you."

B: "Here's what you do: Nothing. We're turning this over to morning shift. But if I find out you didn't write that stiff a ticket so help me God we'll bury you along with them."

RIP warden.

 The obvious middle ground between your comment and Neutral Good Andrew is picking exactly *which* details to describe. More is not always better, but you should have some.

You could go on and on about how Harry's hair was wild, but when you say he woke up and shook a spider from his hair, you can picture that. It sets up the whole image of the cupboard under the stairs in only a few words. 




 Morbid Mel

The bell sat high above campus in its tower and it tolled for Mel. Mel was late for a class he was going to fail. The only reason he had for going at all was to sit near Deb, whom he was fond of and who didn't know Mel's name.

Mel pleaded with his eyes for the bell to slow its toll. As he looked up, he wondered how long it would take a body to strike the ground once they'd leapt from the top of the tower.

"Less than 3 seconds, I suppose," said a man walking in the opposite direction of Mel.

Before Mel could turn and speak, the man was away down the sidewalk, too far to hear Mel's stuttered reply.

As the professor droned on about the theory of gravity, between admiring looks at the back of Deb's head, Mel stared down at his hands and wrists and pretended to take notes. He wondered idly how deep the ulnar artery was under the skin.

"5 millimeters," the pale, redheaded boy next to him said. "Not far."

Mel stared at the boy, then back to his wrist. *5 millimeters?*

"You're on the wrong page. The chapter we're on -- Gravity -- t's a few more pages ahead in the book. Sorry, you looked lost."

"Mm, thanks," Mel said.

---

Thirty years later Mel's son, Bill found himself stuck in traffic. Ahead, an accident had blocked every lane of the highway. A curious thought came into Bill's bored brain. He wondered how long the human body could live after it had been cut in half at the waist.

"3-5 minutes," his phone told him after quickly typing it into the search field.

 Whoah, that's a heavy plot. Thanks 




 What movie is this? 




 The bottles weren't empty, right? If you had been drunk, you'd have still been found out. If you weren't, then yeah let's not have that factor in at all. 




 For my friend, /u/nosleepfinder-butler. 




 There was no night light in the nursery. Not anymore. Three scared children no longer lived there.

William tugged the end of the coarse rope stretching into darkness and the dead weight plowed through the soft damp pine needles of the forest floor. His progress had slowed, but he estimated that he'd come several miles from the house. Sweat mixed with misty rain and ran into his stinging eyes. He juggled the lantern from the crook of one elbow to the other. The body at the end, strung by the neck, lay outside its weak glow.

His soggy oxfords, sleek black and polished to perfection only this morning, slipped in the mud and he fell. He lay still for a moment, letting his physical and emotional exhaustion overcome him. William was far from a physical man. His strengths of protocol, organization and above all perfect poise had served him well as the family's butler for many years bringing him happiness and station. This wretched day he wished he could give it all back to feel only a little less pain now.

It had been early morning. William had left his quarters, his appearance perfectly attended to, and briskly crossed the grounds to the manor. A great deal should have to have been done before the children woke. Their meals should be made, clothes inspected and set out for them to change into, he would ensure that the tutor's lessons were in order. These were on top of the duties that the house normally required. As a butler, his duty to manage the other members of the staff and see everything attended to. A staff he found strangely absent.

William had found Jessica, the cook first. She was lying in the middle of the cigar lounge, a puddle of white vomit on the bear skin rug near her face. The vessels had popped in her eyes, dying them crimson. Mary, the childrens' tutor, had fallen down the stairs. He found her near the bottom, limbs contorted at awful angles. He had to step over her broken body to climb the stairs to the nursery.

At the top of the stairs, his knees buckled beneath him. There was no light on in the nursery.

Of course he'd had to go in. Had to see what had happened for himself. 

Every night as he tucked the children into bed, he set a night light out for the youngest. Someone had come in during the night and smashed the lantern onto the floor. The whole room was ash and charcoal. He left their little bones asleep on their beds.

He'd searched the grounds all day for signs of strangers. Finally, near sunset he'd come upon a man in the garden shed. He felt sure that the man looked familiar.

The petite butler managed to wrestle him to the ground and bash his head with a mallet. He felt sure that the perpetrator wasn't dead and so he'd taken a length of rope and tied it around the man's neck. All he knew was that he wanted to take the man to be as far from the children as he could.

William picked himself up out of the mud and found the rope again. This was the spot; he could go no further. He followed the rope, lantern held out in front of him. It was even longer than he'd realized. It snaked along the ground through bushes and shrubs, at times disappearing under the pooling rainwater.

Then he came to the other end. An empty knot sat half-sunk in the needles. William picked it up and placed it over his head and tightened the knot, then threw the rest of the rope over a sturdy branch.

They say that sometimes, on rainy nights you can still see a small light on in the nursery. You can smell smoke in the air. They say if you watch it all night that just before the dawn, you can see the light being blown out. 




 Thought that I was in /r/jokes. Really sweet punchline. 




 Atom bombs, I suppose. Like those gray, black and white pictures of the Enola Gay and Bockscar with smiling crews. They destroyed 5 square miles of city. The town I grew up in was 4.9 square miles.

What a weird world to live in. 




 Oh, /u/the_itch.

Wait. 




 Thirteen days in and I had yet to *really* sleep. Dawn and dusk bled into each other, just beautiful backdrops for the next drive-thru menu. Between jobs, I ate in my car. I wanted to go inside, but I also didn't want anyone to see me. Without a shower or fresh clothes or even a razor, it was hard to stay on top of things. So I'd order through a speaker box, the nameless person would accept my payment and into the anonymity of the twilight I would disappear, soggy-soaked bag on top of the pile of other soggy-soaked corpses in my passenger seat.

The absence of face-to-face interaction was common to my new job as well. Private contractor. I rented a space in a call center and said whatever they told me to. 

"Set your own hours" they said, but I don't think that they could have anticipated what that would mean when I lost my boyfriend and my apartment. With nothing to do and less than no money to get by on, I spent all day there. I averaged 21 hours a day the first week. I didn't bother counting after that.

I was good at it, I guess. During the day I'd field calls from lonely people considering suicide. At night they were lonely people too poor or scared to pay for a hooker. The formula was simple. The longer you have someone on the line, the more you make. Just keep them talking. If someone climaxed or flat-lined they'd end the conversation.

I comforted old women as they cried themselves to sleep and an old man who called me Betsy after his deceased wife. That one climaxed early. I tantalized middle aged fathers of four and curled the toes of a shy 18-year-old. 

That's probably why I was so good at it. I wasn't afraid to play a part. Whatever they wanted, I became. Never mind what the judgmental blonde at Wendy's thought of me, as long as I was hidden behind miles of electrical wire, I was perfect.

And then day 13 came. I know that it was day 13 because I was supposed to get a paycheck after two weeks.

The call started out normal enough. I didn't have to try hard to get him to open up to me. He said he liked the way women smelled. I told him that I'd just gone for a jog. He said he'd like me to sit on his face. I told him I'd sit on his lap until I got to know him a little better.

I could hear him moving around. Squirming, breathing harder. Some more practiced conversation and he sounded like a pantingt wolf. He was an easy client - if I were trying to get off quick. I threw him a curve ball.

"What's your team?"

"My team?" he asked, confused. 

"Yeah. Your team. I mean, I can't be *getting involved* with a Yankee's fan or something."

"Baseball? Oh, I'm a Pirates fan."

"Really? Me too!"

Now, it sounds clich: baseball to take his mind off of sex. But it's playful and it works. Yes, I would have said that any team was my favorite. It makes them feel more like they're talking to a "real" woman they know instead of just someone pretending. Having an opinion, even a small one, makes you easier to relate to. It's something I picked up from the suicide side of things.

But in this case, I hadn't even had to pretend. I'd lived outside of Pittsburgh until I was 9 with my dad. Some of my best early memories are of going to Pirates games with him. I even had their bumper sticker on my car.

We got back to business, me trailing him, giving him just enough to keep wanting more. Then he asked something unexpected.

"What kind of car do you drive?"

I didn't have a rehearsed answer to this, nor could I think of any benefit of lying, so I told him the truth.

"A Ford Focus."

He didn't say anything for a little while and I had to ask if he was still there.

"The girl I like drives a Focus."

"Oh really? Well maybe that's your type."

"She never looks at me. God, she doesn't even know I exist."

And just like that the mood had shifted from night to day. We'd been talking for almost an hour. With the mood gone, the conversation wound down. I'd lost it. Fuck it, I was tired.

"And I hate my bullshit job! Some days I think I'll just end it. I'll just walk out and finish everything."

"Now don't say that. We're still friends aren't we?"

"I wish I really knew you," he said sentimentally.

"Me too," I said eyeing the clock.

"Maybe you'll see me next time," he said and hung up.

I took few more calls, but my heart wasn't in it. I decided that I should go and take a break. I'd already be getting a nice paycheck the next day, maybe enough to get into a cheap room, and could probably do with a few hours of sleep. I'd just get some junk food first.

I didn't notice right away. I got all the way to Wendy's first. A police cruiser was in the parking lot with its lights on. I drove up to the ordering box and started feeling around for my wallet. My hand found something like a pillow wrapped in plastic.

When I looked down onto the floor of the back seat, I saw him staring back up at me. Blank, purposeless eyes looking through a plastic bag wet with condensation. His gray skin and blue lips limp and dumb-looking. Outside the car, I screamed and my stomach heaved. A police officer starting walking over toward me. I couldn't resist taking another look, and saw that the guy in my car wasn't wearing pants.

One officer starting ushering me inside as the other opened the rear door. I heard him say "We found him," before I blacked out. 




 From bitches who already have stitches! (It's an initiation thing.)
