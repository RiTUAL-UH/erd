 Yeah great film and awesome visuals but all space films are fabricated anyway, it's impossible to build in space so we can only imagine space environments in our world 




 Well going on the new Star Wars film coming out soon, it's really refreshing seeing them go back to its roots

I wish it would become the way forward for all studios now to see the benefits of real sets and practical effects

I think bad practical effects can stick out like a white elephant but at least practical models and effects will always age well whereas bad CGI never ages well and looks bland after a few years

In decades time you will always believe another world in older films because it is all real, nothing was faked whereas older CGI oriented films will look ropey as hell and because it was largely faked and made up, nothing is real to believe

I would say look at Jaws as a prime example, they had 3 model sharks that hardly ever worked but the film was a masterpiece, instead of having the shark as the focus, it had great characters and put suspense and that music to full effect meaning what you didn't see was far more unnerving

CGI in 3D looks ridiculous no matter how much money they throw at it, it will always look fake, then there is IMAX, I wish this format was the standard in films nowadays, all films should fill the frame and be as real and clear as possible, Nolan's Batman films are a shining example of it being used correctly 









 * I just felt like running 

* Shit happens, sometimes 

* Stupid is as stupid does sir 




 I wish aliens would visit earth to annihilate us in to oblivion, there I said it 




 Yeah maybe his parents or descendants had great power so he learned a few tricks of the trade to get by, he's also new like Fish so we don't know anything about him 




 I was being a bit sarcastic with the Star Wars reference 




 Well in recent images lately he looks like he's been hibernating for the past few years

Looks a bit rough and ready, maybe he went in to deep hiding from the authorities

So will we see him suited and booted soon, Scully looks like a million pounds, oh yeah 




 Yeah I would love Adam West to be head of the board of Court of Owls but that'd be taking it a little too far 




 Yeah he was, they got to put it in 




 I wonder if the I MADE THIS credits clip will return for the new episodes? 




 Maybe The Electrocutioner had him for a couple of weeks  




 Would be great to have a song or two by Seal

Kiss From A Rose is still one of my favourites  




 Honestly with Star Wars coming out soon and fever so high

Mark Hamill would send ratings into a galaxy far, far away... 




 Think it'd be great to have a few cameos occasionally featuring people from the Batman world

This can be actors, film makers, authors, artists or anyone connected with the Batman universe 

Imagine cameos from West, Clooney, Kilmer, Keaton, Bale, Conroy, Freeman, Basinger, Kidman or DeVito, Carrey, Pfeiffer, Jones, Thurman, Barrymore, Eckhart, Nicholson, Hardy, Hathaway and not forgetting Hamill 




 Same here, maybe his hookers did sadistic sex torture or something 




 Our world is fucked anyway 




 There should be an episode discussions section down the right hand side for each season

Think this would be a great addition and give more coverage to lesser known episodes

It should be headed by season  episode style and would tidy the main section up a bit 




 Oh great, it takes a wheelchair bound human to raise this issue

WTF have the governments been doing all these decades? 




 I am guessing he had a murky past and Fish saved his life by giving him a job

Maybe he was a homeless thug or something and she hired him or something

Then am sure he would owe his life to her after she saved his, maybe that's it
