 12.5 million customer locations will have access to a competitive high-speed fiber connection. This additional build-out is about 10 times the size of AT Ts current fiber-to-the-premise deployment, increases the entire nations residential fiber build by more than 40 percent, and more than triples the number of metropolitan areas AT T has announced plans to serve.

 Sounds fake 




 I show him this post - he dies of cancer. 




 How is there no tomato in that burger!? I SEE IT RIGHT THERE. 









 I think a lot of people get 'ketosis' and 'ketoacidocis' confused. The latter is the bad one:

 Please elaborate! :D 




 Gotcha, that's what I'm doing. I eat a lot of vegetables though too.  




 Ask for grilled veggies too, it's a free addition. 




 But all others liquors are fine? 




 You know what he meant. 




 Have you ever made and/or tried it? 




 How is eliminating carbs unhealthy? 




 Did you know that you people will up our anything? This is the dumbest askreddit question I've ever seen. 




 Did you even watch the video? 




 OP, you funny. 




 Dammit OP, I just got cancer. 




 What. The. Fuck. Go back to middle school! 




 Can we go back to fake TIFUs?  




 Nah, the way to fight racism is to stop giving it a platform on which to stand. Let it fall into the abyss. 




 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

FIRST: Misidentifying the Boston bomber which lead to an innocent man's death

THIRD: Ellen Pao

Goddamn misinformed band wagoners, I wouldn't leave this site because of the policy changes, I would leave this site because of the circle jerky assness. 




 I guess?  




 I'm on chapter 24 of RPO and the one criticism I have is some of the language seems a bit forced. Like 'maxxed' being written with two Xs or poser being spelled "posuer" and the lack of words like "pwned" and "noob" and this particular phrase irked me like no other "Sux0rs can go fuck a duck."

It seems a bit childish and something I've never experienced in MMORPG games. 

Why did you choose this language? Also, why the time period? I feel like games were *just* getting started in the 80s and the 90s - 2000s had more to offer.

 Yeah, we're a bunch of babies.

For the record, I never vilified her. She's a human being, just like all of us. 




 Do it, OP. You might get a job. 




 Joker looks stupid; movie will suck. 




 Kind of mean, don't you think? 




 For a second I thought we were talking about Greg Abbott 




 To me, he seems indifferent about his teddy bear. 




 Everybody wanna cut the legs off him. 




 And why the fuck is Conan there( 




 So you're telling me PAO ISN'T HITLER?

Reddit is a giant misinformed baby. More people need to read your post, OP. 




 Nice drama roll at the end. 




 Someone played Mass Effect 3 recently 




 Unfortunately it has a sweet flavor so animals tend to drink it. 




 Yeah, you're right. I should be grateful that this sub isn't overrun with it.  




 Man, this sub is on point today! 




 This is something that we'd find on /r/funny.  




 DIGG 




 I'd like this sub more if memes weren't a thing. 

Like, advertisements vs. reality. That's the kind of stuff I want to see. 




 Even if someone guesses it OP should come back and confirm it.  




 "We've got a floater" 




 I'm going to guess Texas. 




 One of my favorite SpongeBob episodes.

 I laughed! 




 Agreed 




 It's just like people blaming the president for everything. 




 How old are you? I'm pretty sure I learned 'Happy Ending' in like 4th grade.  




 Are you sure man? I've heard nothing but terrible things about it. I'd hate for it to leave you disappointed.  




 Yes, reboot the router. 




 I have to admit, I've noticed a drop in their frequency!

Keep up the good work!  




 Yeah, I understand that. But... things aren't black and white... ever. 




 I haven't chuckled that hard in weeks! Thanks man! 




 I wouldn't go that far... 




 Ok Kermit, calm down.

 Careful with that edge.  




 Nah dude is sup 




 Keep jerkin him off 




 That's different.

 We all know that Kanye West holds that crown.

All jokes aside, I will check that documentary out. I think he is awesomely talented. 




 Abilities totally make up for actions man, you're right. 




 Isn't he a complete ass? 









 Funny how nobody enforces the rules around here.  

Still, great work! 




 Yeah, he spent over a year on Mars and didn't ever communicate masturbatimg. 




 Great loop...

 Nobody, the racist subreddits are leaking. 




 Teach me. 




 I don't blame him, Dr. Who is a terrible show. 




 I don't think you know what 'passive aggression' is. 




 "Ma'am, I'm assuring you that what you've heard is just not true!"  

"Dr. Carey..." the woman expressed "there's got to be another way."  

"I'm afraid not, Mrs. Binsan... The only way to prevent your son from contracting the measles is through a vaccine."  

Dr. Carey proceeds to inject the boy. 




 Of course it is, everyone around here loves it. 




 I hope not because that's why businesses destroy products.  




 Squeeze some limes, add alternative sweeter and a little water, add tequila.

 How old are you? 




 I came here expecting BuzzFeed hate. 




 I think it would be funnier if it was toucans.  




 It because we all heard it by watching the video.

 HIMYM, such a trash show. 




 John Mulaney 




 Wow! What a humble dude. 




 What did he say? Was he ecstatic!?  




 That's a good idea. I'll take my money to charities! 




 No!    

I give without expecting a thing. I was taken back by his lack of enthusiasm for a free meal but... Meh! To each his own. 




 Ohhhhhh! Thanks! 




 I bought a homeless man a burger and:

1. He was disappointed I didn't get him French fries

2. He never said thank you

 Time to send in the national guard. 




 I smell butthurt. 




 They are a private business that doesn't need to abide by the first amendment. 

If you're so butthurt about it you should go to voat. 




 So? 




 High Carb, Low Fat diet.

It cannot be easier. Just watch your caloric intake and you'll shed some serious weight.  




 If you want serious answers, include [SERIOUS] in the title. 




 THANK YOU!

First actual turtle world I've seen in some time. 




 Nice cherrypick.  




 uhh... maybe the fact that I can gift a gun to a family member without consequence?  




 Holy shit, you guys are weird. He is absolutely right! FREQUENCY being the key word.   




 One being: the easy access of firearms.  




 "MAH GUNS"

 Nah, you're just scared you'll lose your guns. 




 Have you been under a rock? Republicans will not let that happen.

 Hey,

I'm Jim from the Chicken Nugget Manufacturing Association of America! I have noted your complaint and in a unanimous decision, the members of the CNMAA have decided to reduce the nugget count in our packaging by one in an effort to please the consumer. However, we will not change the pricing. 

Always looking out for you,

Jim  
Head of CNMAA 




 Yep, I can imagine it's brigading from stormfront and coontown. 




 You're joking, right? 




 I've been there, OP. I think at some point we all have or we all will be.  

The important thing you must realize is that life is about you. You want change? Go get it. Don't sit idly by waiting for it to come because change never just appears.  

Are there people in your life that constantly make you feel down? Get rid of them. At one point I had to cut communication off with family members because they were poison for my mind. Toxic people only help to make you ill.  

This life is about you. Do what you need.  

I'd love to give more specific advice. Please PM me. Let's get through this. 




 Lame question 




 Muahahahahaha 









 This wasn't as funny as I thought it would've been. Keep us in the dark next time, OP. 














 Not really that great  




 That first one isn't that great 









 I'd like this subreddit to have less shitty memes.  




 I think it has to do with age. 




 College orientation in the middle of June? 

Edit: Today, [OP wasn't a liar.](http://bealonghorn.utexas.edu/texas-19/orientation/registration-and-dates)

 I actually enjoy original content. Nothing cringey about this.  




 WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT? 




 J Cole and Kendrick Lamar are two of my favorite artists and I can't imagine hating Kendrick and not Cole because of cussing.

 Have you tried "To Pimp a Butterfly" by Kendrick Lamar?
