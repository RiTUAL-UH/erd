 I find I'm turning it on and off all the time. If I'm defending I have it on so I always see the ball but if I'm offense I'll turn it off and basically tap it on and off when needed. Having control over the ball is easier when you know for sure which angle you're hitting it at 




 Oh god it's terrible. I wish I had friends that played the game so I could have a team communicating with voice. I'm by no means good at the game but I find myself being the person defending the entire game because the rest of my team wants to just chase the ball for 5 minutes  




 That's cool and all but what about those of us making salary or commission working 55+ hours per week?  




 I guess being on mobile I'll miss out forever  




 It has been 5 hours. RIP /u/LeBrokkole 




 Not to mention a highway that is supposedly safe to drive 100mph and the on and off ramps from the city are at 90 degree angles so you'd have to slow down to 10mph to turn 




 Did he ever get replies?  




 Man, lines around here aren't repainted until they are completely gone

 This is awesome thanks for the link  




 I've used supernews exclusively as my main provider for a couples years now. Have never had a problem  









 Don't work in a kitchen anymore but I know the feeling. I work 12-14 hour days doing physical work and nobody seems to understand that I *need* to sleep in on Saturday or Sunday or else I don't recuperate my energy for the next week  




 But then the credit applies to the other account which is a nightmare when it comes to app buying. 

Source: I use two Google accounts and had $20 credit on my non-main one, used it on some apps and when I got a new phone ended up accidentally re-buying an app because I was using my main account on the play store 




 I'm a young white male and have gotten like $5 over the last month or so 




 I'd do that even if the money were different colors  




 When will you put microphones in your cameras that don't sound like the camera is wrapped in tin foil?  




 That fridge is way too small for 9 people  




 I really want one, fuck 




 I actually got a print of this from the artist who did this. Had it hung in our spare bedroom until we moved  




 My reply was "what if he doesn't sleep though?" because he didn't sleep ever 




 I can't take it. This pizza looks perfect  




 There still isn't a way to have multiple schedules? That's a bit disappointing. I haven't played in over a year and was hoping that was something that would get implemented as I know people wanted it back then  




 I use the handicap stall whenever available. Don't feel bad 




 So I think it already looked good before... But it looks damn amazing after  




 Yes God please. Why hasn't it happened already? I'm sick of going to comments to to find out that the name of every game is Darude - Sandstorm  




 What possibly could she have done to grow reddit? The way I see it, reddit is a machine driven by the users and anyone at the reigns trying to control the beat are being drug in the dirt 




 Htc one m8 same app no worky 




 Staying that skinny isn't easy for everyone  




 I was one with a cracked lens. HTC replaced it 




 Good point. I know people who do worse: post art and then up front say "if you don't have any tugboat nice to say then don't say it at all"  and proceed to block people who have constructive criticism 

*edit* autocorrect fucked up but I'm leaving it 




 But you implied what the other person said was criticism and I'm telling you that it wasn't. I'm aware of who said what.  




 Did someone say cities skylines?  




 I remember seeing a rage comic almost exactly like this one years ago. Back then I didn't really get it but this exact thing has since happened to me and I totally understand that feeling now 




 I didn't ask for this, but I need more  




 That wasn't criticism dude

 My son's first birthday was yesterday, thanks for making me feel inadequate  




 Thanks, that definitely makes sense. 




 Elaborate on those signs of it happening to voat already please  




 I really appreciate this sub. It wouldn't be what makes it so great as a default sub 




 This is good but it doesn't help steams over-saturation of shit games 




 Oops, I should have specified I heard mixed reviews of the tp-link routers.  




 I spent 170 on my netgear Nighthawk ac1900...didnt seem all that outrageously priced to me 




 I've heard mixed reviews. Some people say they're great and others say they're cheap crap 




 Gundam future  




 Fuck I was just getting my hype train on the rails until I saw this comment and remembered about the awful reality of Android games 




 Also entering numbers on a column why press the down arrow key when my pinky is already on enter?  




 Agreed. Most of this is a cheat sheet for dumb people not even specific to excel  




 I gagged a little when the pizza sauce happened. I didn't read the title, I didn't know what I was getting into  




 I'm pretty sure cream cheese packages are 8oz 




 What I like more is the consistent rotation direction when you swipe back  




 I don't know if that's a problem I'd want to have. I feel like it would also make me talk faster and dealing with clients all say long I don't think I'd want to be talking too fast or get annoyed that I perceive them to be talking too slow  




 If it's subs I definitely can't go that fast. I try to read and also see what's going on. If it's too fast I'd end up just doing the reading portion and then I might as well say screw it and read the manga 




 I should listen to some podcasts at that speed. The Giant Bomb podcast is so damn long 




 Man there's always direct TV or dish at trade and home shows and they are always like "how much do you pay for TV?" when you're trying to walk by. They never believe me when I say I don't pay a dome because I have Internet  




 Whoa I didn't know this. That's fucking clever. I was sure someone would have demonstrated this on YouTube so I checked it out. Apparently it's actually 9% and it's not even noticeable without being compared side by side. 

And now that I know this, I want Netflix to have an option to speed everything up by 9% so I can squeeze more commercial free TV shows and movies into my time-limited day 




 Monoprice cables are garbage. I've never had a single one last longer than six months  




 I fell for Battle of Los Angeles on Netflix. Fell asleep after a half hour 




 Yeah this is a record setting heat wave 




 This is the most uncomfortable magic video I've ever watched.  




 Where is this? I always see stuff like this but it's always pizza Hut in some other country I'll never have enough money to go to 




 I remember when he stopped developing for the game because he didn't feel he had anymore inspiration to continue to make meaningful updates to the game and a ton of people here were up in arms because he wasn't going to be giving out anymore content updates without getting paid 




 Both sounds good  




 I wouldn't say it's a company wide scam. Corporate sets the rules and then scumbag store manager sees the potential to make more money by not keeping small bottles in stock 




 And as I recall, the final ingredient was a black truffle  




 You're goddamn right 




 And let me guess (assuming here:) that when she passed away, the siblings came running back acting like they were the ones that cared the most? And then on top of that started fighting about who gets what?  




 See: EA/Maxis for Sim City  




 Someone definitely needs to make a pre-order rage callout bot 




 I just used their title. I also provided timestamp links to notable events within the video in a comment  




 Yeah hopefully it survived, it looks like it got knocked in the head more than once 




 I imagine they try to find any combination of rocks trees, cliffs and caves  




 I couldn't imagine being in my car for 8-10 minutes straight of hail like that

 Now to make it actually deconstructed, cook the yolk and whites separately and separate the bacon fat from the rest of the meat and cook each with different methods  




 I love AEON NOX. I won't use any skin without home screen customizations amd custom buttons. I use smart Playlists to organize my TV shows. I have one category that only shows TV shows I've tagged as anime, and one for kids cartoons. Then I have a Playlist that shows all TV shows except for a young contained in the anime or cartoon Playlists, that way my base TV show list doesn't just have every single TV show 




 Is aeon NOX different on Kodi? I haven't upgraded yet because I don't see any apparent reason to. My XBMC on gotham works perfectly and I don't want to change anything.  




 It can go both ways. "look at that fat ugly person.... Yet he's getting loads more sex than I am"  




 You can buy 50ft rolls on Amazon  




 Your milage may vary with carpet vs sisal rope. I've had two Towers so far, my cat managed to tear the sisal rope faster than he's torn the carpet one 









 I haven't even played the game yet and I know I need this 




 I don't know what vexilogically means but it does look pretty awful  




 The real question is why would anyone want it?  




 I wonder if we're getting to the point where we won't be seeing significant meaningful improvements in phones year after year. The only thing I can really see that has a lot of room to improve is battery life.. But as far as screen resolution and processor speed, and storage space, not so much. 

I feel like the only reason the M9 is getting panned is because of the M7 and M8. A lot of people felt that the M8 wasn't much of an upgrade from the M7,even though the M8 is a fantastic phone. I'm seeing the same thing going from M8 to M9. The M9 is a great phone but that's two generations in a row where people felt that the next iteration wasn't a significant upgrade from the last

 Exactly the vibe I got watching the trailer. Definitely the metaphorical lawless west situation  




 Why goddamn why do they create these awesome aliens and only let is play as human? It's fucking bullshit.  









 But the fucking stupid thing is that it has to be your parent Google account. So the YouTube account I've been using for years and kept my username on because fuck using my full name on YouTube, I can't use background and offline listening 




 One time I went to California and a gas station I went to didn't have the regular pay at the pump machines, it had a single machine you went to, but you couldn't use a credit card at it. It had to be a debit card because it was basically an ATM for gas. So I had to eat both the machines ATM fee and my banks. Then I'm done with that and go inside to get some snacks, nope same fucking thing. Had to eat the ATM fee again. Fuck that place 




 I feel like I've read this before. 

Also as someone who works sales, I recommend you tell customers of the place to ask the place to put their menu online. Stores are always apprehensive about new things and since you're presenting them with this idea or tool, even if it's completely free, they feel you have something to gain from it that they're missing out on.

If enough customers or sometimes even just one regular customer requests it, that puts the power in their hands to do it because the customers are wanting it. I've had stores order things I didn't have any intention of selling to them because it wasn't something that did well but a customer wanted it so they ordered it

 Below the parent post to mine you'll find redditors complaining about how unprofessional his shirt is, which to me sounds like a backtrack on the misogyny argument. I recommend not proceeding because reddit and professionalism in itself is an oxymoron  




 Most kids don't like the idea of uniforms and I doubt any look forward to wearing the same thing every day for 30 years when they're done with school. That probably looks more like a highlight to kids "oh man if I work there I can wear what I want!"  




 The ESA should be represented by their scientific accomplishments and research, not individuals scientists' choice of clothing.

 Coke and pepsi make deals with entire theme parks to be the exclusive beverage provider. It's not much of a stretch to assume Coke is the only soda you can get on that entire island  




 Not to mention, it's the 100 year anniversary of the Coke contour bottle. It's been around so long you don't even have to see the logo to know it's a coke bottle 




 Yeah, I feel like the product placement on this movie actually felt like part of the Canon because of the way the park was being ran 




 I use supernews with a blocknews account for backup and have great success with that  




 This gets asked at least once a week on this subreddit it seems. There's nothing out there that's suitable. Once upon a time, EA released something like Sim City 3000 for Android but have since taken it down I believe. It was decent if your phone ran it. The only games out there where you build cities and stuff are the clash of clans type games

*edit* if you have a tablet 1849 may fit the bill

 Spoilers for anyone who didn't play this game

Fighting Mr Freeze in Batman Arkham City was probably the best boss fight I've ever done. You had to use the environment to find ways to weaken him, and everything you used only worked once. He wasn't just a bullet sponge  




 I never knew I needed a giant trumpet until now 




 Replying here to remind myself to give you gold later 




 Thanks for clearing that up. I may have to try this out since I'm running my box on Windows  




 No custom skins is a deal breaker for me 




 It isn't always so bad. One time I went to buy a new wallet and couldn't decide between two that I liked. I decided to get both and decide at home because I didn't have all day to stand there. I'd just take the one I liked less back. Well each wallet was like 20-25 base price and we're something like 20% off. So I was expecting to pay $30-40 for the two. Well little did I know, there was an additional sale where if you bought items whose base price was 40-50 in one transaction, you got an additional percentage off your final total. Long story short, I kept both wallets because buying both ended up being cheaper than buying a single one on sale. I don't recall seeing any decent wallets for less than $10 when I was there during the no sale period  




 Yeah I literally saw nothing until I saw a comment mentioning how this post was the only thing in /r/all that wasn't about fph being banned. I had no idea what fph was so I went to /r/all and made the swift decision to never go there again because it is a silly place  




 Fucking this. I was on both ends of this though. I hated listening to others struggle through reading out loud because I could silently read faster, but I also struggled to read out loud. I do see why "popcorn" reading is necessary though because everyone should be able to read things out loud 




 So far, olive garden soups are still safe. Made from scratch every [other] day. The reheating method is the same as you described but there is nothing wrong with that  




 The watch wouldn't be necessary because there are at least 2 other devices there that can tell time there 




 I'm calling right here: Shou Tucker takes home the gold 




 Looks intentional to me. The top edge of the USB port lines up with the top part of the headphone jack  




 I *hate* the diagnosis after a 5 minute conversation type deal. My wife has been through a lot the last couple of years and only in the last year was she able to find the right therapist for her and the end of last December she found a fantastic psychiatrist through her therapist. 

Her previous doctors were giving her bogus diagnoses after 5 minute discussions without really working with her, one had said it "sounds like you may have bipolar but I don't want to make that diagnosis because it's difficult to treat". Sounded more like she didn't want to spend the time actually doing anything other than collecting a paycheck. 

But when she scheduled an appointment with this psychiatrist she had to do a 70 minute questionnaire with him and they ended up talking for about 3 hours before he diagnosed her with bipolar (I believe II). But they started working with medication and he had her on a mood stabilizer but she was still rapid cycling after a week so he had her on an anti-psychotic for a month and ever since she's been really stable with the mood stabilizer  




 The velcro ones were the best. We had to stop using swaddled at 4 months because he started rolling and also really hated being swaddled  




 This is exactly why I nicknamed my son Little Ricky Bobby

 I've had this issue on two M8s. People say this is common among all phones but I've never had this issue with a Droid X2 or my Galaxy Nexus. Even with a brand new M8, I notice some connectors don't make as solid of connection with the Jack in the M8 as others. I have a cable from Monoprice in my wife's vehicle that it never really feels like it makes that final click when pushed in all the way, and it comes out too easily.  




 I just lay down in bed, nothing special. Sometimes I'll get anxious about shit and keep over thinking things but that doesn't happen often
