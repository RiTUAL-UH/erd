 If they have a bigger budget then they should find ways to balance with revenue. I can understand short term spending like during 2008 but long term deficits are very unhealthy. 




 Huge transfers from other provinces too. 




 At any rate, 30% debt to gdp is nowhere near a disaster scenario. California's debt sounds scary to other states, but they also don't have economies larger than many countries. 




 You're giving Ontario way too much credit. Even with the health care cost burden, a province taking up that much debt with comparatively small amounts of revenue is literally insane. The problem is that Canada is famously short sighted about spending to stimulate industries that will be important 20 years later (with the exception of oil sands). Now it's too late. 




 It's a ludicrous comparison because California has much less independent as a state than Ontario is as a province but yet is still able to fix their budget.

I'm a Canadian, and it's depressing for me to see provinces with absolute amateur hour financial policies and no industrial foresight. 









 Transactional taxes will always be regressive against people on the bottom of the ladder. Investments are one of the most efficient ways of wealth building (and retirement saving!!) so we shouldn't increase those barriers. Why not just have progressive tiers for capital gains taxes by earnings or total capital assets? 




 That's still regressive against small-time investors. Think of it as a sales tax but for investments. 




 Higher CG taxes could also spur smarter investment too, especially if the barrier to cash out is high. 




 Open the link incognito. 




 You don't need GPS. Phones have an IMEI identifier that you can track across cell sites and countries. 




 I discovered dry idea roll on. The one with shirt guard saved me from decades of stains. 




 To be fair, a lot of women are socialized ro be either immediately defensive (fear of assault) or reticent (fear of appearing easy). Especially when adrenaline or excitement is high with a crush or with a date, it could have the wrong effect. 




 I agree, but I'm specifically referring to the effects on inflation. 




 QE and the tarp programs could have been at least twice their size. The inflation needle barely moved, which means that they could have printed more money. 




 I wouldn't say no matter how efficiently. But the bar is indeed pretty low. You have to throw a bunch of money at a wide variety of industries in hopes that a few will pick up steam. 




 Industries need regulation, but cab drivers already suffer from obscene daily/weekly upfront medallion rental prices. Uber takes that out of the equation, grows substantially, and the city suddenly wants to "protect the labor market"?

The fact is that many Uber drivers are not full time and can do it as a flexible side job solely because they don't need to pay upfront for medallion usage. They pick their own hours, use their own cars, and can leave the Uber system whenever they want. These are all win-wins to me, and it's hard to see how Uber could extensively fuck over their drivers especially when the barriers to entry and exit are so low. Anyone can drive a car. 




 Those are lattes though, which require more labor. Come to the Bay Area and you can also find places that charge 5 for a "small batch" cup of drip. I mean, it's tasty, but not 3x more delicious. 




 Once wireless broadband gets good enough, prices will drop pretty quickly since wireless telecoms don't have to dump money into laying fiber to get performance increases. 




 Isn't that way too hot for olive oil? 




 It's the same for most tagging systems, which is why humans shouldn't be put in charge of organizing huge sets of arbitrary data. 




 Instagram is a lot more attractive than Twitter because the only thing you can do is post images. Substantially less bullshit and easier to monetize. 




 That's misleading. A substantial portion of housing price increases are due to the stupid amounts of VC money flying around. The Peninsula and SF are still the mecca of white new money. 




 On the other hand, paying several million in cash for a home is pretty much the literal definition of putting money into the local economy. The question is what the seller is doing with all that cash, and whether the new owner would sell to another foreigner or to someone local. Either way, it's a one-time cash injection from an outside source.

The real effect is the impact on housing prices. But part of the blame is on Vancouver itself, which for decades did not put any effort into developing any sort of robust advanced technology industry or financial sector. Coupled with the city being ridiculously beautiful, and all you attract are outsiders who want to buy land rather than be interested in building up local wealth. 




 But that is probably actually true to a very large extent. Given the age of the Universe and the short time that intelligent human life has existed (and will probably last), advanced civilizations are most likely blips in the Universe's timeline. On an intergalactic scale, you would have civilizations at any given time that are equal in technology, but at the same time they are very far apart. You could probably draw a very, very large boundary in the Universe in which humans are the most advanced beings at this given time. I'd wager that it could even be a substantial part of the Milky Way. 




 I'm not sure that's correct. There's plenty of oil wells around in protected lands. It might not be enough for the entire planet, but it would definitely be enough for a substantially smaller global population. 




 That's actually really hard to do if you don't have any kind of technical or scientific background. When you're not an expert, how are you supposed to know what kind of data or conclusions are sound? 99% of what you read is secondary literature anyway -- people aren't going to hunt around for a primary source, let alone know what a citation even means. 

You can read a very eloquent and technical sounding blog post about how X cause all kinds of immune problems, and all they would have to do is include in a few real citations in order to make up bullshit in the other half of the article. 




 You're absolutely right -- people have selective memories. Your turn signal does not automatically trigger the asshole response in every driver around you. In fact, most people will just think "oh, he's coming into my lane" and slow down a little without even giving it a second thought. 




 What about super skinny jeans, a flannel shirt, and ironic mustache? I could even ride a fixed-gear bicycle to the party. 




 I think once the surgical wound closes, there should be no difference between this and a plaster cast. 




 What kind of drug was this? Doesn't sound like a normal effect. 




 No, the problem with AoU was that there was no tension and long scenes that did literally nothing to advance the plot. Joss Whedon was trying to cram too many things in there as if it was a TV show with multiple episodes. None of the main characters in the franchise were going to die and Ultron was always going to be defeated. Normally movies make up for that by having really compelling characters but Joss Whedon turned it into a fast talking and quick takes movie. 




 Totally off topic, but I wonder if black guys in general suffer from penis anxiety. Like they are worried that everyone they sleep with are expecting them to have a big dick. 




 I don't think universal healthcare would work in the USA. There's not enough accountability in public systems for it to work. You can already see it in Medicare/Medicaid and the VA system. I've witnessed all sorts of bureaucratic nightmares after living here for about a decade and it made me very cynical. For some reason in Canada, public systems just work better. 




 I'm Canadian, so I have some outside perspective on this matter. Having individualized healthcare in the USA (decoupled from employment) would never work because of how the insurance industry is set up. All individual plans on the exchanges are expensive and terrible compared to employment based insurance. Sure, you get subsidies if you are unemployed, but if you restrict the discussion to those who do have jobs then individual versus employment insurance plans are not even in the same galaxy.

The only way individual insurance would work is if Congress set new guidelines for insurance premiums and minimum coverage. That said, it should be a company's responsibility to provide comprehensive health care coverage to all workers, regardless of whether they are part time or on contract. 




 Not just that, but businesses that hire only part time work are able to fuck over people's live so much that they are unable to find other work. When you are on an unpredictable shift schedule and when you are basically "on-call" in retail, you have no control over your life. 




 You obviously have no idea how VC or Silicon Valley works. 




 The problem with reddit is that the community makes the site. Reddit literally has no other tech infrastructure that makes it competitive like Facebook or Twitter. They are ripe for disruption by better tech, better community organization, or better monetization strategies. It's only a matter of time. 




 Dude looked super hungover. 




 The fact that reddit is so huge but is unable to attract big talent speaks volumes about the management team, the board, and the work environment. 




 I don't get why people don't like True Detective this season. Were they really expecting the exact same thing as last year? I think this season so far has been an excellent and compelling crime drama with a lot of political intrigue. 




 If you can speak Cantonese, you can easily tell it's satire. Nobody can speak in that kind of flowery language about a fucking 16sqft apartment with a straight face. 




 Also, it's not clear why you need 7800 people to made a couple of phones that are basically minor modifications of each other. 




 It's probably something more subtle. It has to make sense in his head somehow otherwise most people would go insane. I'm sure that it's a mixture of extremely aggressive treatment for preliminary biomarkers, along with a big dose of self-rationalization. 




 To narrow it down a little: this is an extremely culture-specific manifestation of depression. I think mental illness is very rarely acknowledged in East Asia. 




 The fact that The Guardian referenced this guy is a statement of how far their journalistic standards have fallen. 




 I mean, reddit is basically a glorified BBforum that's sorted by rank instead of just by last reply. Communities around the internet existed just fine a decade ago. They'll just go somewhere else. 




 Imagine what iama would turn into in 6 months if all of a sudden the sessions turned into shit. Nobody would ever visit that sub again and PR would certainly never agree to appearances. It's like how bad or hostile interviews are the kiss of death for talk shows.

Similarly, imagine what would happen to reddit if all the submitted links turned into shit. The only thing left would be the same weekly questions on askreddit. 




 It's still anti-vaccine -- he still wants to claim the moral ground of being a skeptic, so he and many others pick on an arbitrary ingredient that "sounds scary". Because of course scary sounding chemicals are automatically dangerous. 




 HK-born here. I thought Infernal Affairs was a really mediocre movie while The Departed was great -- probably because a lot of the cheesiness and melodrama was thankfully lost in translation/subtitling. 




 If I were the SO, I would use this as an excuse to splurge on a high end super flusher with bidet and heated/cooling seat attachments. 




 The more fascinating part is that hair and teeth are by no means uncommon in teratomas, which means the genetic program required to differentiate into them must not be that stringent since cancers have messed up genomes anyway. 




 I think that influenza-aasociated narcolepsy is the bigger story than the connection to vaccines. It wouldn't be too hard to find the exact causative trigger if it's really the case and I'm sure that's what they are working on now.

Now that a potential molecule has been found to possibly trigger narcolepsy, they can also work on a drug to treat narcolepsy without using the other crazy ones on the market. It could also be used at the same time as a flu vaccination. 




 33:56, Eminem was about to burst out laughing. A few minutes earlier there were a bunch of fast cuts, probably because they were both cracking up. They're both definitely in on the joke. 




 There was a clip where she was on Ellen and they were talking about Ben Affleck's dick in Gone Girl. She just seemed really cold, sarcastic, and kinda snippy. 




 If you look at what AMD has been doing in the past year since the new CEO came in, it looks like they are working hard to pivot themselves back into the CPU game. Especially with the new architectures down the line, they aren't playing the budget game anymore.

While the integrated graphics are still a nice plus point on AMD's products, it's clear that Intel's solution is "good enough" and having good graphics performance integrated next to the CPU is not something people will throw money at.

My guess is that AMD wants to take a risk in order to boost R D for their CPU business. The need cash for that, and there's precedent for it when they sold off their fabs for a pile of cash. 




 I don't think MS is stupid enough to buy out AMD's CPU division. That would make Intel and the DoJ really angry.

It would be likely that they will buy out the graphics component that belonged to ATI, as well as all of their IP in the mobile sector. They would leave AMD with their x86, which will give the company a huge cash injection to push their new architectures. 




 I would throw money at the screen to see Defiant class ships go toe to toe with the Klingons!!!! 




 I think by the start of WWII it was a forgone conclusion that the KMT would lose. The Japanese invasion just stretched things out. 




 The problem is that the timelines are all messed up.

The Chinese Civil War happened at least a decade before the start of WWII. If the Communists never took hold, the Japanese would have been fighting the KMT. It's unclear if a Republican China would have stood a chance against Japan, so we could be looking at a very extensive Asian theatre in WWII.

That being said, if Japan still lost in more or less the same way as today, then I don't think the Cold War would really happen at all. You would never have the Korean War, no SE Asian incursions of communists, and I doubt Latin America would play along if the USSR's only "bright spot" of was in Eastern Europe (which they mostly won by invasion). 




 If there were indeed toxins in your body, why would they be hiding in your gut for you to shit out? They would be in your bloodstream where your liver and kidneys would take care of it. In fact, if you assume that some kinds of "bad stuff" immediately leaves the kidneys into urine, simply drinking lots of water would help you get rid of it. 




 Many Asians and Eastern Europeans would vote Republican if it were solely based on policy issues. Many are anti-gay and are socially conservative. The problem is that there are a few very racist voices inside the Republican party who aren't censured for what they say or believe. Very few immigrants would vote for a party that has that kind of behavior. It doesn't take much for a party to have the reputation of being racist. 




 Whenever someone says this I immediately think of the Ferengi, especially from Deep Space 9. 




 Avengers AoU was also incredibly boring with a million fast cuts. The first half of the movie was dizzying with all the scene changes. There was also about 50 minutes' worth of superfluous scenes that just made the movie plod along. 




 Kurt Russell was stressing me out the entire movie. I had no idea whether he would turn out bad. 




 Tuition freeze is a terrible idea. Look at what happened to UBC and SFU 15 years ago. 




 How is it possible that people are willing to pay that kind of money for alternative treatments but not want to pony up for expenses at a "conventional" facility? 




 He's also been saying this since 2008.

 "One guy"? Not too long ago, whites in this country routinely lynched blacks in public. The only reason why it doesn't happen now is that it's socially unacceptable to support it publicly. There are still plenty of racists around that would be more than happy to revive the old days and shoot a few black people if they weren't afraid of being arrested on hate crime charges. 




 It's bad if you find it late. If you get regular screenings when you are an elderly person then there is much less risk. The problem is that old people are notoriously crotchety and refuse to go to the doctor. 




 Anything cheap and white will be very sweet. 




 Are you then implying that math classes are less competitive in Eastern Europe and Asia? Because that's definitely not the case. 




 It's simple -- Ellaria doesn't give a fuck about anyone except for her love for Oberyn. She doesn't care of Trystane gets held prisoner in King's Landing, because that would help accelerate war with the Lannisters. She also doesn't care of Doran executes her afterwards, because she would get her revenge in war between the two houses. 




 Gendry is the only one left with definitive Baratheon blood. 




 Are you kidding me, most farmers that do staple crops such as corn and soy don't store seed. They buy their seeds every year because seed quality is extremely variable when you plant your own. Even if farmers weren't buying Monsanto they would still buy seeds every single season. The ones that are not are traditionally called "heirloom", which are the fancy kinds you find at your local farmer's markets. 




 You.... you mean we can get rid of all of the people from Digg? 




 The interesting part about reddit is that over time as this issue dies down, all the FPHers would overall be downvoted into oblivion by community members. The only reason why it's being upvoted now to the front page is because of its controversial value. 




 Not to mention who would you hire to actually do this? If a whistleblower decided to say something when they see someone sprinkling mystery powder over some meat that magically fuses pieces together, then that is the literal end of the restaurant. There'd also be lawsuits. 




 On the opposite spectrum, I know a few people who are ridiculously good looking and model etc. Many of them are just so goddamn positive about everything in life, and genuinely believe that everything will work out for everyone. Not a hint of cynicism or realism in their bones, which can be quite frustrating. 




 Dutch? 




 Been living with my girlfriend since 2012. Just the past week she told me that she thought my stomach was always bad and that I have chronic diarrhea or something. Nope, just reading reddit. 









 There is a huge "individual" component to it which is likely to be genetic. Birth control, for many people, works extremely well when you use it properly. But there are a small subset of people who will have recurring difficulties with hormonal birth control and these are the ones that show up prevalently on the effectiveness stats given "perfect use". 




 I just feel bad for all of the children in the family. In some ways I feel sympathy for the parents too because I wouldn't wish for any parent to have to make some hard choices when they see their kid fuck up. So many people are screaming that they should have taken their kid to the police on the first incident but I know of many more who would hesitate. For the most part, family bonds are extremely special, and it is disheartening to see the Duggar parents fail to prevent other incidents from happening. Then you have their proselytizing and public life, which makes it even worse.

The worst part is that the media focused so much on Josh and the parents with little disregard to the victims. Did they really ask to be thrown back into the shit again? We seemingly give lots of sympathy and support to other rape and sexual assault victims, but for some reason not them. And then we impose our own moral standards on them and accuse them of being brainwashed, as if they are too dumb to have a mind of their own just because they are conservative. 




 Grew up in Edmonton. It gets pretty hot up there, but I don't think I can ever get used to 30C+, or basically anything above 85F. 




 Actually historically party members did not regularly vote along party lines. It became such a huge problem that the position of Party Whip was invented. 




 Why? Germany, South Korea, South Africa, etc were all recent hosts. I'm sure that they could manage given some preparation. 




 Proportional Representation achieves the opposite goal of electing populist leaders.

A democracy is fundamentally designed to slow things down so that extremists and rash policies cannot quickly take hold of the government. The American system, while not perfect, is pretty good at that with two party gridlock. Other countries slow it down by having a multiparty parliamentary system. 




 How hard are landmines to see by infrared reflection? A cheap drone could do that kind of work, and at nighttime when the weather isn't so punishing. 




 When were we ever "promised" agency from Sansa? 




 Then maybe cities should be more responsible and not rely on bullshit tickets for padding their budgets. 




 Two turnovers in 30 seconds?! 




 On the other hand, Ned and Robb were foreshadowed to die for huge portions of the TV show and book before it actually happened. I mean FFS, they spelled out that entire scene when Stannis names Robb as one to die. If anything, after Jon gets stabbed he will be picked up by the WWs since this episode so clearly showed that they took an interest in him. 




 I don't live in SF directly so I can't give a 100% accurate comment, but in my experience getting around the city was a pain by car and by public transit. Parking is literally impossible and the transit system is a joke for a supposedly rich city. At least south of the bay you have some more breathing room. In my opinion there are just as many things to do for young professionals, with the sole exception of nightclubs. 




 I disagree -- the only thing that SF has that the rest of the entire Bay area doesn't are nightclubs. There are plenty of nice bars and restaurants all over, as well as fun things to do.

As for the commute, you could literally Uber to a Caltrain on both sides and still come up on top in terms of saving time and money. You could even own a fucking Nissan Leaf for the weekend jaunts and not be in the hole. 




 Renting is still not terrible south of SF. It's only if you want to buy a home. And at the rate those are going for, why would you want to do that? You could literally rent for the rest of your life and put the rest that would have gone into the home into mutual funds and come out on top in 20-30 years. 




 How do you break even with $1200/m and $45k? I was making that much and breaking even on a $2k apartment, so you should have been saving tons. 




 Then why not live south of SF if they're just into parks and things outside of their home? Places like San Mateo and Palo Alto are really clean and family friendly. 




 I've lived in the Bay Area for about 3 years and don't understand the hype of SF. It's close enough that you can just drive in to get to the nice stuff. 50%+ of the city is dirty as shit and the public infrastructure is awful. Why not live south of the bay? For the same price or lower you get to live in a little suburban area that is probably exactly the same as the nice parts of SF. Except for the nightclubs -- I don't think I've seen an actual one south of the Bay. 




 Not sure why you are being downvoted. The problem is that people are super picky about where they want to live. The peninsula south of SF still has quite a bit of affordable locations. Shit, even MV has apartment complexes with 1br at $2500/month which is peanuts in the area. I'm living close to Palo Alto and my rent/utilities comes out to be $22-2300/month. The combined income of me and my partner is $90k. We are able to put away a little bit of money every month, aren't living paycheck to paycheck, and we can't eat all the groceries we buy in a week either!

I think some people just have some really strange ideas of what a "middle class" and comfortable lifestyle is. Perhaps it's a problem of people moving to the area when they're too young, making more money than they can imagine, blowing it all on eating out and partying, and then complaining that they don't have a sustainable income.

A childless couple on $150k/year in the SF Bay could easily save up/invest for a downpayment for a house or even for retirement. 




 What would happen if the Y chromosome fused with the X during sperm development? Are these viable? In evolutionary biology there's many instances of chromosomes fusing and splitting between species, but how does this work for sex chromosomes? 




 I think it's painfully obvious that it's going to turn out exactly like how you described. Otherwise it would be such a stupid cliche that a beloved dragon princess suddenly rules the planet. 




 Sometimes it takes a little more than water. Milk of magnesia/magnesium supplements and mineral oil are pretty good laxatives, with the latter helping to lube things up as they come out. 




 It also really helps if you drink it at night and before you go to bed. Sucks for going to the bathroom, but it's way better for bowel movements. 




 Actually, negative results are some of the most exciting ones and can get high profile publications. The problem is that many graduate students will stop when they get a negative result instead of thinking about why it happens. When you can make a new story that revolves around it and break it down mechanistically, then you have a great paper. And imagine if in the process, you can tune the system from a negative result into a positive one! That is real science. 




 Nobody ever told me to wash the area under it, but it became natural to wash it while the rest of my body was getting clean. I might have lucked out though since I have very mild foreskin instead of a huge turtleneck.  




 I'm 31 years old and own tons of purple and pink shirts. I get nothing but complements. Wear what you feel like wearing! 




 If you need to exfoliate, don't use scrubs. Instead use anything with AHA or glycolic acid, which are chemical exfoliants that stimulate skin renewal. There are cleansers and moisturizers that contain them. 




 So you're blaming companies for wanting to make money from movies? Personally, I'd fucking love to see Defiant class ships drift in space and kill some Borg.

I'm a Trekkie, but even I know that making nerdtastic sci-fi movies isn't sustainable. You have to pay the actors and staff more and more to come back for each sequel. If you care about the "quality", you'd just read the novels and fan fiction. The old series are still there. 




 The Pauls are against oppression from the federal government. But states are totally cool to do whatever they please. 




 Not much of a backstory. She just basically believes everything that Littlefinger says and that everything will be alright if she just marries into the Bolton family. 




 I guess the best comparison would be if the same people complained about The Wire because it so very accurately portrays the brutality of life in the ghetto. 




 But that's the whole point of the episode. No matter how much she tries, she will never be stronger than the other assholes around her. It's the subversion of expectations and tropes that is classic in GoT. 




 But one of the points of the entire series is to show how women are brutalized by all kinds of evil men. Bringing about a visceral reaction is the goal, so why would they tone it down? It's supposed to be hard to watch.

It's not supposed to be mindless entertainment. Take The Wire for example. That show is supposed to make viewers uncomfortable. In hindsight how would the viewers have reacted if they toned it down? 




 Or they were actually counting on Sansa, one of the most pathetic characters on the show, to somehow pull a fast one on Ramsay? Really? 




 They also give lots of grants and fellowships to cancer researchers.
