 I will for sure. The translation is a pain in the ass so it's slow going but I'll get more posted as soon as I can. 




 A few weeks ago while cleaning out my Grandma's attic, I found a dusty old leather journal. I've just gotten around to reading it and it's some pretty dark stuff. I thought I'd post it here to see if any of you had grandparents with similar stories. Gran has dementia and has been moved to a home but I hope to be able to speak with her about what I've read.

I've typed out the first few pages (it was written in German and my translations may be a bit off, forgive me.)

_____________________________________________________________________________________

Day 1: I found this journal in the satchel of food and I suppose from here on I shall document what happens to us. 



My name is Ella. My father, Fritz, knew this day would come. Our family, half Jewish, had been living in fear for some time. My fathers status as a well respected doctor kept us reasonably safe but he knew it was only a matter of time and he taught me all he could, working late nights in the office, learning field medicine by dim lamp light, practicing on fruit, meat from the butcher, and eventually the wounds of those who escaped the raids. Trucks were coming every day and taking neighboring families into the ghetto. They were getting closer and the fear in the air was palpable. 



Every night when we finished our practice he would pack all of his supplies back into his medical kit and send it up to bed with me, insisting that when the time came I would need to take it and run. Mother, while generally a jovial woman, had been tight lipped and pale since my education started. I knew not what her worries were, only that every night when I made passage through the dark kitchen to my bed by the back door, she would hand me a satchel stocked fresh with the days leftovers, loaves of bread, cured meats and hard 



Today, the time my parents feared came upon us. My uncle Karl, lean and blonde and fair as he was, appeared at our front step. I did not immediately understand the symbols on his uniform but my father behind me hissed SS. Grimly, uncle Karl had nodded. He motioned to me and instantly the satchel of food was slung over my shoulder and the heavy leather medical ag was being pressed into my limp hands. With sad faces my parents together told me to run and I did. Uncle Karl dragged my parents from our home and pushed them onto a waiting truck. My mother wept, my father stood proudly and checked his pocket watch before another SS officer ripped it from his hands. I could watch no further, and so I ran. 



I made it to the end of the alley behind our home and nearly lost balance when a young man popped out at me from behind a tree. It took a moment for my fear to subside but when my vision cleared I saw that it was Eli, my betrothed, holding a satchel similar to mine and looking frantic. I started to ask him what he was doing there but a loud gunshot behind us made it obvious that this was not the place to talk. He grabbed my hand and we ran past the edge of town and into the small copse of trees separating us from the road to the next village. When we stopped to catch our breath I asked again. Eli, what has happened? How did you know I would be there? Your parents, are they gone? Please, tell me what is happening. Eli smiled sadly, nodding. Ella, our parents knew this would come. Your uncle, Karl, he gave them as much warning as he could. Your training, such as it was, and mine, were to prepare us to run from the Nazis and to save others as we went. My parents were taken two days ago. Ive been hiding in the alley because that was where my father told me I was to meet you.




Day 3: It is hot. My god, it is hot. The temples in each town we pass though are burning. The black smoke curls thick and makes the air unbreathable. Abandoned houses are standing, staring, with shutters and doors open, banging in the occasional stiflingly hot breeze. I told Eli I think they look like frightened faces. Two eyes, black and unseeing, and a mouth wide open in a silent scream. He shook his head, of course, and asked why I had to make everything eerie, but I saw him regard the houses more closely as we passed. 



We havent slept since leaving our home town. No where seems safe. My fathers medical bag feels like a cinder block in my tired hands and the satchel, although becoming progressively lighter, is causing great aches in my back. Weve made camp tonight, safe or not, near the banks of a river. We think we are close to a town but all has been quiet. 




Day 4: Last night we made camp and to bring our spirits up we pretended that we were having a picnic as we dined on rations from my satchel. We refilled all the flasks with river water and just as we were settling down, the sobbing started. It seemed as if it was floating to us on a breeze, though the night was still. Eli and I crept quietly from our camp, carrying our provisions along just in case, searching for the sound. We tracked the source of the sobbing to a large patch of tall grass and reeds near the rivers edge. Eli, being much braver than I, stood and parted the grass with his arm. 


What I saw there, I may never forget. A young woman, a child perhaps, just beginning to bloom, was tied to an iron loop that had been hammered into the ground. Large gashes covered her arms and shoulders and her dark hair was matted with blood. I knew we couldnt leave her there bleeding so while Eli kept watch, I stitched her wounds with my fathers supplies and when I finished I untied her. She had no recollection of how she came to be here, only that she last remembered being dragged off the back of a truck bound for the ghetto, and then waking up here as the sun went down. I expected her to follow along with us when we prepared to leave but when Eli explained that we were travelling to save others, she waded across the river and started running without a backwards glance. 


It wasnt long after that the first pink rays of morning crept into the sky and we stumbled from the trees into this empty little town. Weve barricaded ourselves in the cellar of a house here to sleep. At dusk, well be on the move again.
 




 Chewing doesn't hurt, really, but yawning sure does. It feels like there's sharp things stuck in my jaw. 




 Not even close. My parents were being told this story in the 70's. Lol 




 I'm still waiting patiently for the next installment. Who knew mold was deadly AND addictive?! 




 It totally isn't sudden though. It's been a trend as long as I've been here. 




 Took the words right out of my mouth. 




 Everything on r/nosleep is real. There's a list of rules in the sidebar if you have further questions. :) 




 I understand the sentiment but I'm not sure r/nosleep is an appropriate place for this. 




 1. That link doesn't show a comment made by me. Get your shit straight before you try to use something against someone.

2. Why do YOU care so much? All I said was read the sidebar, and you dug through my comment history until you found something to launch a personal attack with. 

3. I don't pretend to have power anywhere. I don't have any interest in being a mod. My interest is keeping r/nosleep safe from impotent goons like you who exist solely to start fights.

So I basically did exactly what the rules state I should do, until you decided to start harassing me. I can only assume that your need to bully and belittle me stems from the fact that I'm a woman and thus an easy target for your fragile masculinity. 




 Sorry 'bout yer luck but only you can see your comments. Because they were reported and removed. You really need to stop with this whole personal attack thing.  




 I just need to make it SUPER clear that this response had nothing to do with you, and that I didn't make a "mistake." Your comments got deleted so I couldn't respond to them anymore. So you found another of my comments and decided to continue attacking me because... why? 




 This comment had nothing to do with you. I responded to KrackSmellin's post. YOUR posts got deleted and the conversation ended.... 




 So you actually were so mad at me that you went to my profile to find something to use against me, and I'm the weirdo. I shouldn't have to defend myself but since you've tried to use something against me, r/all amuses the shit out of me and I end up in some really strange places. If you had the time to comb through which subs I've commented in, you also read my comments. Which were A. Calling someone an asshole, and B, being a woman and agreeing with a man. SOOOO weird. Totally worthy of a personal attack.  




 Then you don't belong here. Sorry. 




 If you know the rules, and you know that everything here is true, why even bother commenting in the first place? 




 Seriously?! READ THE FUCKING SIDEBAR.  




 READ THE SIDEBAR 




 We're actually downvoting you because you're breaking the rules. Read the sidebar before you act surprised about downvotes. 




 You're obviously new, or incapable of reading the sidebar.  




 If you're too stupid to follow the rules, you shouldn't be here. Reported. #byefelicia 




 Do a bit of research on the painter, see if you can find any photos or medical records, find out if she had a child that died. Also might want to look at county records and make sure you're of no relation to her. 




 Keep in touch, OP. We'll do what we can. What made you leave? 




 I'm a woman, and I actually agree with most of what you have to say.  




 Thanks!  




 I found smoking a bowl combined with some naproxen and the magic bag on my face, is sufficient. 




 Try having ABSOLUTELY no choice but to go to work with that pain. Because if you don't go to work you and your family will go hungry for the next week. So then you go and take care of a child while experiencing that. Like. The shit is bananas. I used to smoke pot and that helped a bit but I've been too broke lately. 




 I get that kind of pain in the back of my head on the left side. Fans or having the car window down reduce me to tears. 




 I wonder if that's whats up with my pulsing/crushing muscle spasm headaches. I have one wisdom tooth left on that side... Hmmm. 




 I heard everything and felt all the scraping and pressure, just no actual pain. Meanwhile hallucinating Simpsons "alternate universe" episode/Family Guy crossover. 




 My hair is dark but my Mum's was ginger 'til about the time she had me. Neither of us freeze worth shit and usually have to either deal with the pain or be knocked out. Dentist triple-froze me thinking she was being smart, started wisdom tooth extraction, then had to get new tools after I knocked hers out of her hands to tell her "THAT REALLY HURTS YOU KNOW." 




 So are you accusing the OP of being a liar? Or are you just a giant fucking asshole?
I grew up in a junk yard. In my day you needed a mallet and a virgin sacrifice and an entire pack of smokes to get brakes done. 




 Yep. 18 hours writing wailing and puking in the emergency room. Scared the bejesus out of everyone around me and kept passing out but triage said I was cool to wait for EIGHTEEN fucking hours. Good old free Canadian health care. At some point someone gave me a pillow and a blanket because my sweater kept riding up over my chubby belly and some old guy was offended by my indecency. Needless to say, I don't have a gallbladder anymore. 200+ stones (worst my surgeon had seen in 25 years.) AND to top it all off, guess who didn't know they were allergic to morphine and reacts to it with crippling muscle spasms? Yep. That's right. Me. 




 Total toss-up between my first gallbladder attack, or the first trip to the bathroom after laproscopic surgery. I mean, I went drag racing the day I got out of the hospital AND I have heavily shaded tattoos. I'm pretty good with pain. But that shit was unbelievable. (pun totally intended.) Edited to add: I had over 200 gall stones in varying sizes. It was the worst my surgeon had ever seen in his 25 year career.  




 Me too... And getting these INSANE headaches. Shit. Nosleep wins again. 




 Que? 




 You should read the sidebar. Asshole. 




 You should read the sidebar. 




 Why are you even here? Nosleepers don't take kindly to fuckery. 




 Nosleep has rules. Sort of like.. your guide to experiencing nosleep in the best way possible and not incurring the wrath of writers/believers, etc. The rules are in the sidebar but I'm gonna paste them here for you anyway. They're easily missed.

 I  don't think it's an immediate danger type of situation. More like she's mentally ill, unmedicated, and frighteningly unstable, and things could go wrong really fast. I personally have accompanied her to the emergency room when she has been out of control.  




 About the drugs/guns, yeah. I'm not sure what ended up happening there. I'm not sure about involving them in this though. It feels somehow like I'm being petty or something and the police wouldn't take me seriously. 




 Hey Reddit, it's advice time. Miss Manners never wrote abut this one. 

Should you/how would you tell your neighbor that the person (from here on to be called P for ease of communication) caring for their children is someone who sells illegal drugs, and their body? 


You in this instance have seen P in possession of multiple illicit substances, as well as an illegal firearm, and personally know that her past employment has been terminated due to stealing, inappropriate sexual conduct in the workplace, and failure to follow basic rules and instructions (essential when caring for children?) 

I'm uncomfortable being a shit disturber. I was considering dropping a quick note in their mailbox. I don't fear retribution from the neighbors, but I do from P. She is already systematically trying to ruin my life because I refused to continue being her "bitch. I haven't let my dog out to pee alone, walked the dog alone, or left my door unlocked for any length of time in weeks. She is unstable and has been known to be violent. The SPCA was called on her due to suspected neglect and abuse of her dog, and since then she has been attempting to ruin my life by going behind my back to personal and professional contacts and spreading unfounded rumors in an attempt to ruin my reputation. I work as a nanny and I feel it's relevant to say that in my profession, a few unfounded rumors can easily destroy an otherwise spotless reputation.

So, Redditors, what do? 




 With the pain in your windpipe and the standing on the stool and the photo of the beam, I'd say someone was hanged in that pub and you yourself are in danger of the same. I'd have a look at the local records, maybe ask a few of the older folk if they know of any anecdotes about the place, and I'd likely find someone to stay with you or find somewhere else to stay until your parents return. Good luck OP and keep us updated. Edit: As well, in the jumbled up conversation with Sarah, "En mi camino" means "on my way." Not sure if that has any significance to you. Second edit: una luz en mi camino, means "a light on my path." 




 Congrats from Canada. You're all lovely and I'll personally owe you a drink if you ever find yourselves in Nova Scotia. First person to bring me one of those "yes" badges, gets cupcakes! 




 Not sufficient. You're an ass. "A gay" is seriously pissed off at you for being a bigoted prick. 




 Maybe you should find out more about the seller... 




 Hi 




 *ralph 




 ? 




 I 100% figured "old man" meant husband. Also didn't notice the name thing. 




 I hadn't thought of that. Like maybe he killed his brother to save him from becoming the next "perfect child" kinda thing? Or maybe he was just fucking evil and the pills and harnesses and such were to keep him from hurting anyone...
