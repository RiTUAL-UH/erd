 Read the comments on JCs Instagram. Nothing but 10 year olds and foreigners with broken English. 




 Diablo 3 2.0 released over a year ago 




 I take it right when I "get up" which lately has been 10-11pm after laying awake foe hours watching netflix. Take it along with a probiotic, multi vitamim and fish oil
 I'll usually have a small oatmeal about 30min later. 




  complains about clickbait titles

 You will not like this game. It is more MMO than it is Elder Scrolls 




 Here's the thing: don't make it about meeting women. Make it about doing something you enjoy and women will come naturally.

At least that's what the Internet's told me. I've barely met any women. 




 What about a co-ed sports league or volunteering somewhere? 




 Meetups.com 




  I'm surprised they don't send out email when a concept ship goes on sale.

But they do? Subscribe to CIG's newsletter 




 Self posts net 0 karma.... 




 Or project mismanagement, which happens in the entertainment industries all the time. But I trust CIG to get the job done.

 Some countries have these kind of consumer laws, but what Mizerok linked below is not litigation.  




 This is reddit. Part of the fun is figuring out new and exciting ways of regurgitating the same things again and again. /r/TIL and /r/adviceanimals are built on doing just that. 




 To hopefully get old fans like you to buy the game. If they put a current star (e.g. reigns) on the cover, most people wouldn't know who that is and be less likely to buy. 









 Likewise, over last year I put about $800 into the game and sold for about a $15 loss. Oh well, at least that money bought a new 970 and 1440p monitor instead of Internet spaceships 




 I've levelled tons of toons with full look gear in dungeons and there is no possible way you got to 90 in 5 hours. 




 In what mindset did you go "Hm, this would be an interesting addition to the conversation" ? 




 The stickied thread: A summary of what tha fuck is goin on n' tha future of tha hood.  




 Which any literature fan would get 




 Hey Homer! Way to get Marge pregnant..aha ha.

...These are getting more abstract, but thank you! I do enjoy working at the bowling alley. 









 Amanda's the more plasticy-surgery one who doesn't talk or fight. Dianna is the bitchy, manipulative one who's already married to her "fiancee." But they're both blonde bimbos, so I can understand the confusion. 




 He's making up shit. How would he know? 




 Dianna is a living Jessica Lovejoy 




 You don't like criticism? 




 Not even the PPVs? Some of the matches were pretty good. The KO vs. Cena matches were both spectacular. 









 2200 upvotes for booty. This ain't even cyberpunk. Fuck this subreddit. 




 2.5 seconds between attacks? No thanks. 




 You're right. Soon we'll have adults marrying babies, grown men marrying orangutan's, cats and dogs living together..mass hysteria. These truly are the end times. 




 *No chance that's what ya got...* 




 Isn't that an absolute statement? :o 




 /r/Reformed is hilarious to read at the moment.  




 For the confused: http://www.reddit.com/r/brokehugs/comments/3b74hd/scotus_decision_megathread/csjh1f6 




 Thanks for telling me what is good for my country. Got to love Americans. 




 You kissed a girl. That is so gay. 




 ...we don't know. 




 Michael...

That's another! 




 Why are you posting this on Reddit and not reporting it to someone? 




 Get back to work. You're not being paid to talk about games. 




 If you're at work you could have said so from the beginning. And you call me rude for asking you to back up your opinion (and it's a good thing you are being honest, else I would have thought you were lying!)

 




 Why are you being so hostile to me? I asked a simple question as your original post was very vague using just the word "mechanics". God forbid you ever go to school or work or anything and are asked to explain an opinion or idea. 




 You still never explained it.... 




 Explain how it's "far better than Wildstar"? 




 Practice practice practice. And even more practice. Model anything you can think of and ALWAYS use reference images. Come on here with completed models and ask for feedback.

Additionally, since you want to model human figures like in that drawing you linked, learn how to DRAW human anatomy decently before learning to model the human body. It will make your work much more accurate. 




 Yes. Blizzard said they wanted 2-tier expansions.

 I will get it for $5 next year with patches. 




 Please drink verification can 




 Could you really? 




 "Better" 




 What hobbies do you do? 




 Any interesting man isn't going to be a personal entertainer for a couple hours. Jut go on Netflix and watch something.  




 But it's a more epic and cinematic storyline! /s

I love single-player games in my MMOs. 




 You have attained the rank of Pussywillow 




 Quiet, Lisa...dog is barking 




 Suplex City, bitch. That line made me start watching again 




 STOP THE DAMN MATCH 




 $50 lol back to Wildstar or SWTOR 




 Furthermore, the WoW expansions offer a shitload of content...I doubt HoT will come close to what WotLK or even WoD has 




 He's going to main event Summerslam... 




 Surely there's no harm laying in the middle of a public streeg. 




 Think someone would do that?

 Tour the north and the countryside. Go see places that inspired all the medieval folk lore like Nottingham forest (Robin Hood). Hadrian's Wall and Stonehenge too - both ancient, but Stonehenge is far older. 




 Troll?

 If someone asked your male friends "Would you have sex with whitestadultyouknow?" 9/10 will say yes. The 1 left is lying or gay.

But if someone asked you "Would you have sex with x y or z (your male friends)?" you would likely answer no (or correct me if I am wrong).

That makes it inherently a one-sided friendship. The man wants it to become sexual, but you do not. Friendships between men are two-sided; neither of them wants sex, since they're hetero. They simply enjoy each other's company and are not expecting anything more from the relationship. It is a more "pure" kind of relationship, since both parties are upfront about what they want from the other person - just friendship.

 I'm an amazing friend to those who deserve it.

How modest. 




 Everyone's ganging up on you but you're entirely correct. Women do not need to be as funny or interesting as a whole, as men will seek them out regardless. Men do need to be funny/interesting to meet women. It all comes down to evolutionary biology. 




 Aeon Flux was an American tv cartoon creared by a Korean American animator. It is not anime. 




 You posted a whole lot of nothing to say one thing:based on CIG's track record there will likely be further delays.

Learn to write succinct. 




 Let's not file a police report to begin a paper trail. Instead let's post on Reddit. What the fuck 




 Foxy boxing...hot oil wrestling... 




 Shut up 




 A county can't be all European (i.e. white), but it can be all Asian, African, Middle Eastern, what have you. But to be white is to be inherently racist....apparently 




  1. This subreddit is 18+. If you are under eighteen, do not post.

 




 Simple question; I'm curious how many fellow Christians are here just like to joke about the mother-sub (which I stopped reading because it is pretty repetitive and full of junk). How many of you are non-believers, either ex-christian or otherwise?

Edit: to clarify for myself, I'm a typical grumbling anglican englishman who loves to complain on internet forums 




 Uh......no. 




 Cape Feare.

"Now, when I say Hello Mr. Thomson and step down on your foot, you smile and nod."

"Gotcha."

"HELLO MR. THOMSON." *steps on Homer's foot*

*Leans to other agent* "I think he's talking to you." 




   I think my generation is a bunch of pansies and complainers

Agree entirely.

Good lord, the amount of people my age (I am in my mid-20s) who complain about not being able to find a job is staggering. Take a shit job and suck it up until you build some experience. Holy shit, they're practically giving jobs away in Alberta right now (I am Canadian). I never see the Chinese, Indian or other foreign students/20-year-olds complaining about a shitty job at McDonalds. They recognize they got to do hard work and put up with shit; they're not pampered. 




 Well..let's go to the old mill anyway...get some mouse pads 




 He's saying "insolvent?!" 




 The yogurt is also cursed 




 ...care to expand on anything you said?  




 Here comes the shaq attack! 




 You got too much free time 




 BUT WHY 




 Hey...I took a look at some of their photos and videos...I am Christian and even think this is a bit cheesy, but their wrestling is actually pretty good for a niche indie circuit. 




 ...just kidding 




 I wish you luck, but maybe the reason more women aren't interested in you is because you sound incredibly generic. "Funny, nerdy, normal" is all we know about you. Funny and normal are essentially requirements for even friendships...try telling more positive, unique traits about yourself.

And I don't mean "I also like movies and music." 




 oh yeah! 




 hope somebody got fired for that blunder 




 Did you even read the OP? 









 The strong must protect the sweet...the sweet.... 




 Carry on! 




 Take some drawing courses at a local community college, or even just buy a simple sketchbook, some pencils and find a nearby life drawing class....that's a good way to start anyway. If you want to get good, you need to practice everyday. 




 /r/truegaming ? 




 Learn to art 




 Learn how to code. Or learn how to art. Why the heck are you even worrying about choosing an engine without basic coding and/or art skills?

 Digital Tutors is the best. The amount of stuff on there is insane; anything from 3D modeling to concept art. 




 Additionally, find a GOOD 3D modeler on YouTube and watch his/her other videos. I am in school and have access to Digital Tutors and other professional tutorial sites; about 2/3 of the "tutorials" on YouTube are absolute garbage in comparison but there are some good channels out there.
