 Yeah that makes the most sense. 




 Elephantitis of the knees. 




 Man, that's so sad. He is really left with no choice but to vacate and start over imo. 




 So that makes me wonder, was it someone in his hunting party? 




 Just finished watching The Hunt, and while I thought it was a fantastic film, I need to know, who the fuck shot at Loucas? Are we to assume what happened to him will follow him indefinitely? Or am I a blundering idiot who missed a giant part of the plot somehow?

Thanks in advance!

 I was thinking, "who cares, she's a nazi." Glad I wasn't the only one. 









 Oh thanks, that explains it. I had no idea the time was changing, that pisses me off. Are they trying to reduce viewers?  




 Canadian here. Why am I not seeing this episode anywhere on TV? 




 Gosh darn! 




 I know right? I can't believe it's happening. 




 If you're close to Arizona, you can check out primus and tool playing the monster mash festival this year. This Halloween is gearing up to be amazing. 




 Low expectations will help I think. 




 All the food in the picture was turned into poop.

 Woah, I had a guy try and give me this same speech the other day.

 Good ol Tom Waits. 




 He looks absolutely disgusted and that makes me howl. 




 Surprised he hasn't mentioned the fact that Canada hasn't seen any major fire or brimstone falling from the sky since it was made legal in 2005. 




 Maybe the city should have a punching bag program, where they'll install second hand punching bags for free in your home. 




 Yeah you're exactly right actually. I've walked home from the pub through this particular park at night and the amount of 12 year olds causing havoc is rather concerning. Now I haven't witnessed them dismantle a park bench, but pushing shopping carts into the ~~lake~~ swamp seems to be a fan favourite. 




 Holy shit. 




 I just picture the city workers sneaking into parks at night busting up benches with hammers now. 









 BOO! 




 This is goddamn hilarious. 




 I too have two. My wife and I could use the vacation. 




 Probably not what you're looking for but this is pretty enjoyable.

 Woah, grand falls! Me too. 




 The amount of energy we are witnessing in this video truly is unfathomable. If you have 53 minutes, I recommend watching Nova's "[Secrets of the Sun](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ncphh8FWUUE)" if you like this video.

 I guess it depends how many medical marijuanas you've injected.

 I'm of the opinion the smaller the venue the better. If you haven't experienced one of your favourite bands in a small venue yet, then you're in for a good time. 




 Just started "Luther" (Canadian Netflix), and I'm finding it great. Maybe not BB great, but it sure is enjoyable.  




 Yes. This would be fantastic, and hadn't crossed my mind. 




 During the rendering process from video to GIF, you have to pick up your tower/laptop/tablet/phone/toaster and shake the living shit out of it until you get something like this. 




 Think of the Care Bears, that's what I'm going to do. 




 Relax, honey. You were just having a crazy nightmare. You're back with your family now where there's nothing to be afraid of... except that fog that turns people inside out.

 Haha yeah it's hard to decipher between sarcasm and funny ha-ha in text based communication at times. 




 Man people on reddit are super mean, I don't get it.  









 Living like the gunman sorry. 




 I cannot fucking wait. 




 I may be going out on a limb here, but I noticed that scully was in what appeared to be an FBI uniform, whilst mulder was dressed in an army jacket, like an underground paranoid type (living with the gunman). I wonder if that's how this will play out. Or maybe I'm just looking way too deep into it. Thanks for the pictures all the same, must have been a good time. 




 If only these guys had their first names switched. "Dick Sweat is on the loose!" 




 Without fact checking and going from memory, I believe the heads on spikes in ghostbusters II was Adam as well.

 Try (slowly) placing the entire back end of the animal in your mouth. Let it warmly sit there for several minutes so it calms down, when it finally falls asleep, return the animal to its natural habitat in any populated shopping center. 




 The collector in me says I need to own a captain howdy mask. How does a non-Facebook using Canadian acquire one? 




 Couldn't agree more, the gregorian chanting in Save Our Souls Lisa is both maddening and peaceful at the same time. I remember ordering that album from "cdnow.com" after I first watched that movie. I still have it and listen to it occasionally. 




 Ah I see. I stand corrected. 




 I'd rather they upped the monthly charge.

 I've always been a fan of quality over quantity. 




 They have a sister company in town to I believe, called "Flaming Paintworks" so depending on your location maybe look them up as well. 




 Yeah what they lack in web design they make up for in awesomeness. They're located just off of McKnight Blvd on 19th street behind the Best Western Port-O-Call in. They don't gouge, and they do great work. Not sure what else to say.

 I had a dream last night I was directing a horror movie and some of the effects were super freaky. I remember asking billy crystal if he would play a part and he said "there are enough horrors in this world davey boy, what it needs now is laughter". 




 Thanks. 




 September 6, 2016 




 So, I am a creature living in the sewers of the audiophile world. I am a father of two small children, so therefore my budget is fairly limited. Today my Onkyo TX-NR609 amplifier ceased to exist. It was nothing fancy, but it did the trick. I would game/movie watch/listen to tunes through it VIA xbox/xbox 360/xbox one/PS3 (media server). So all I would like to know, is what would be a decent replacement for the amplifier? This is assuming my speakers/sub are still operational. I'd like to stay around $500.00 CAD. 




 I had a dream the other night where I was back in a department store in my home town where my mom would take me shopping for back to school clothing. The place was so dimly lit and eerie. As I was walking through I felt like I wasn't me, and I somehow hijacked someone else's body as I roamed around. I ended up bumping into 9 year old me trying on baseball hats in the mirror and it freaked me out. I like to believe that I had time travelled in my sleep, and that frightens me.

EDIT: redundancies. 




 Just give me what I came for, then I'm out the door again. 




 Depends on the package. 




 Haha I'm in. 




 That would be super. Set up a date with Ian, he knows my schedule haha. Thanks a million. 




 Thanks for the input. This is my first time really messing around with audacity and/or recording anything at all really. But I think you're right, that as long as it's listenable we shouldn't worry about quality too much. Also, I'm not aiming for professional studio quality, I just want everyone's levels to be somewhat similar. When I listen to it driving I noticed the internet streamed voices were a bit of an ear assault. 

I'm scared of the effects menus, they're scary and it makes me frightened. 




 Hey thanks! Hopefully there won't be too much lag between all parties when counting down from five. 




 You just spent your money on stickers and a hat. I'm curious how the fuck they can even take your money without disclosing the fact the website hasn't worked since 2009.  




 As some of you may know, /u/Jafvalla and I are conducting an interview themed podcast of sorts. We are beginners, busting our way through an age old established formula. As anyone could have guessed, we are running into a few production/quality issues.

I've managed to figure out how to record a stereo mix of the audio through google hangouts, however with that, everyone's sound quality suffers slightly. 

If anyone with audio/recording experience could give suggestions, we would be greatly appreciative. My questions are as follows:

 * How can one record their own voice in addition to a stereo mix of what's coming from the internet? (When I attempt to open two audacity windows and alter "stereo mix" to my microphone, it automatically switches to the same recording settings in the second window).

 *  If all parties involved record their own voices, how does one match them up simultaneously/ seamlessly? Is some sort of queue required at the beginning like a [clapperboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapperboard)? That to me seems to be the only way, but I have no idea what I'm talking about.

 * If a stereo mix of audio is recorded from my station, where my voice will be crystal clear, and others may sound "tinny" or louder than mine, what is the best way to equalize the audio?
