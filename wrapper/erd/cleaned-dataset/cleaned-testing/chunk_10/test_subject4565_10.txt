 Meek Mill been putting out bangers while Drake was still playing Degrasi on the Disney Channel. I don't give a fuck how many teenage girls buy his records.

 Meek is the truth. He actually started from the bottom. Drake started from the Disney channel. I thought HHH was smarter than this.

 Does this remind anybody else of Michael Hasting's death? Almost 2 years, RIP.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hastings_%28journalist%29

Death

"On June 18, 2013, Hastings died in a single-vehicle automobile crash in his Mercedes C250 Coup at approximately 4:25 a.m. in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.[53] A witness to the crash said the car seemed to be traveling at maximum speed and was creating sparks and flames before it fishtailed and crashed into a palm tree.[54][55] Video from a nearby security camera purportedly shows Hastings' vehicle speeding and bursting into flames after crashing.[56]

Witnesses described the car's engine being ejected 50 to 60 yards (4655 m) from the scene.[55][57] Hastings' body was burned beyond recognition. The coroner identified the body by matching fingerprints with those the FBI had on file.[58][59] Two days after the crash, the Los Angeles Police Department declared that there were no signs of foul play.[60] The coroner's report ruled the death to be an accident.[61] An autopsy showed that the cause of death was massive blunt force trauma consistent with a high-speed crash.[61]

Hastings was eulogized in the media by figures such as Christopher Hayes,[62] Rachel Maddow,[63] his co-workers at BuzzFeed,[64] and others.[65]

Allegations of foul play, and assertions to the contrary

Soon after his death, some described the circumstances surrounding the crash as suspicious.[66]

Former U.S. National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism Richard A. Clarke said that what is known about the crash is "consistent with a car cyber attack". He was quoted as saying "There is reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powersincluding the United Statesknow how to remotely seize control of a car. So if there were a cyber attack on [Hastings'] carand I'm not saying there was, I think whoever did it would probably get away with it."[67] Earlier the previous day, Hastings indicated that he believed he was being investigated by the FBI. In an email to colleagues, which was copied to and released by Hastings' friend, Army Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs,[68] Hastings said that he was "onto a big story", that he needed to "go off the radar", and that the FBI might interview them.[69][70] WikiLeaks announced that Hastings had also contacted Jennifer Robinson, one of its lawyers, a few hours prior to the crash,[71] and the LA Weekly reported that he was preparing new reports on the CIA at the time of his death.[72] His widow Elise Jordan said his final story was a profile of CIA Director John O. Brennan.[73] The FBI released a statement denying that Hastings was being investigated.[60]

Motor Trend technical director Frank Markus said that the ensuing fire was consistent with a high-speed car crash.[74]

There are conflicting opinions as to Hastings' death. After his death, some media outlets recalled that Hastings claimed to have received death-threats from the military after the McChrystal article.[75] Hastings' widow Elise Jordan has said she believes his death to be "just a really tragic accident".[76][77] His older brother, Jonathan, said he believed Michael was experiencing a "manic episode" shortly before his death, and that he may have had suspicions were it not for this observation.[78]

Cenk Uygur, friend of Hastings' and host of The Young Turks, told KTLA that many of Michael's friends were concerned that he was "in a very agitated state", saying he was "incredibly tense" and worried that his material was being surveilled by the government. Friends believed that Michael's line of work led to a "paranoid state".[79] USA Today reported that in the days before his death, Hastings believed his car was being "tampered with" and that he was scared and wanted to leave town.[80]
FBI files
FBI file on Michael Hastings

The FBI file on Michael Hastings and its attachments (totaling 21 pages) were released to the public on September 24, 2013,[81][82][83] after investigative journalist Jason Leopold and MIT doctoral candidate Ryan Shapiro filed a joint suit in July 2013 against the FBI for ignoring their FOIA requests for the file.[84]

The FBI failed to respond to the requests within the allotted 20-day period.[85] On August 15, Leopold released a statement that read, "The Department of Justice (DOJ) has indicated that the FBI has likely located responsive records pertaining to investigative journalist Michael Hastings".[86] Al Jazeera, along with Shapiro, released results from a FOIA request showing that the FBI's Washington field office had opened a file on Hastings in June 2012 to store "unclassified media articles" and "memorialize controversial reporting by Rolling Stone magazine on June 7, 2012". The attorney who filed the FOIA lawsuit, Jeff Light, suggested that it was uncommon for the FBI to open such files on reporters."

 Clever girl 




 You are very welcome. With a name like JewDank, have you tried /r/treesgonewild ? 




 You're perfect :) 




 I'd rock you. 




 Beware the watery spry ass. 




 Somebody hit a pigeon with a fly ball and the outfielder scooped it up and tried to nurse it back to health. I forget the teams though.

I would love to compare times with you.
 




 Is a troll's main goal to amass as many downvotes as possible on a given reddit account? 




 Sorry bro, I already sold my soul to the Pastafarians.  




 #Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here 




 Bravo. 




 If 37 million names get leaked, were gonna need a new subreddit to keep up with the drama.  




 This might be the nicest thing anybody's ever said about me.  




 How do you see this one doing?

(say badly, Reddit loves to prove people wrong) 




 Ding, popcorn is ready. 




 Who leaves halfway through a movie??

Deserved that, OP. 




 ;) 

I'd give you half, but text posts don't generate link karma.

:( 




 Did you just call me a wank head? Haha my bad, I didn't realize that was your sub. You're a real pisser. 









 Have at that karma, bro. 




 I know, I was originally tempted to re-post the story so everyone could see that OP is a dickhead animal abuser (or accessory to the fact)  




 Oh man, I would do terrible things for this book.  




 I used to work at a local used bookstore, would love to find an older (late 1800's) copy but that's a long shot. Even a mid-late 1900's copy would be pretty sweet. 

I have found some absolute treasures among those shelves.  




 That is a fucking sweet tree. 









 Is it easy to get a hard copy of this book these days? 









 Dude, is it Cabrini? That sounds like a Cabrini thing to do.  




 Yea, fuck cops wearing body cameras, I'm about to start wearing a body camera. 




 SweetPinkTacos checking in. 




 And he would have got away with it too... if it weren't for these meddling kids.  




 Mr. Anderson... 




 Wait for it... 




 So this book was written 50~ years *after* the individual bible stories were written, and 100~ years *before* all the stories in the Bible were officially complied into "The Bible". 




 You know... you are absolutely right. Maybe we've been fucked up for 18 or so centuries because some ancient librarian accidentally put the Bible in the non-fiction section and "True Stories" in the fiction section. 

We've been duped! 




 Haha my bad, I thought I was replying to a top level comment, and that you were talking about the guy's face in the wikipedia article next to the link. Damn mobile.

But yea Tom Cruise does suck now. 




 "A 17th-century fictional portrait of Lucian of Samosata" 




 Starring Tom Cruise? 




 Great advice, thanks! 














  /u/ahhitskatiee just fucked up. Reddit loves cats. 




 According to her post history, she's an animal science major thinking about becoming a vet... 




 According to your post history, you're an animal science major thinking about becoming a vet? And your posting a picture clearly demonstrating animal cruelty/abuse? 

"Your friend" is a piece of shit.

If it's not your cat, perhaps you should rescue it from whoever took this photo. Do you actually care about animals? 




 No, OP is still full of shit. ^^^see ^^^what ^^^I ^^^did ^^^there? 




 Exactly. According to OPs post history, she's an animal science major thinking about becoming a vet... 




 Lucy!! You got some splainin to do! 




 Doing gods work, son(s). 




 So... OP was in the bathroom while the cat, sitting on top of the toilet, "got into the shaving cream" as the title suggests, knocking it onto the floor and immediately divebombing on top of it as it explodes. Then, the cat decided to roll and thrash around in the same spot, ending up staring into a corner, and waited while OP got his/her phone out and took a picture.

That's probably what happened, right?

I can see why your cats look at you this way. 




 Nice try, google AI 




 And stood in the same corner while OP fetched the phone/camera?

That cat would be long gone.

And yes, I've had cats my entire life, from the moment I was born to age 30. 




 It's tough because there's not a lot of Bitcoin owners out there, in proportion to non-bitcoin owners. And many of those who do hold, are doing so long term, not readily spending. Also, because of the inconvenience and security risk associated with 3rd parties, many people will shy away from a Bitcoin transfer when there are other viable alternatives (cash, money order, check, credit, Paypal, etc.)

There needs to be some serious changes (at a society and infrastructure level) before you can expect frequent Bitcoin payments while working in an industry not at all related to Bitcoin. 




 And I'll be damaged if Mr. Rich didn't pull out his cigarette lighter right there and light that award on **fire**... 




 Look at the cats body language. It is clearly scared of the person holding the camera. Whoever took this photo, intentionally sprayed this cat with shaving cream, like an inhumane piece of shit. 

The cats nose is scratched up and there's shaving cream in it's fucking eye.

It is also sprayed fresh underneath the toilet on the wall showing it was being sprayed from well above ground level. 




 And the fresh out of the jar clumps on the metal bar hanging from the toilet. Someone was clearly holding it in the air while it was being sprayed. 




 Don't lie, you shaving creamed that cat. You're a scumbag. 

It's nose is all fucked up too, not to mention shaving cream in it's eye. 

Karma's a bitch. 




 What kind of classic car is that in the door reflection? 




 Money orders cost like 75 cents and you can get them many places, for example WaWa.

 Weird! I had a friend who had an old creepy wooden door in her room that led to the attic. I remember very vividly a story she told me that involved an instance of heavy knocking on that door which scared her badly. The door was never used and she was home alone. Old suburban house in an area heavily used during the revolutionary war.

 If she's got 2 kids... she definitely isn't allergic to nuts.

See what I did there?? 




 So make it on a smaller fucking budget. 




 Update, OP! Is he blind 4 lyfe? 




 I just picked up /u/JawnDenver a couple weeks ago. 




 Haha, well done.

 Man, you must be bored. Isn't there another thread you could be sucking the fun out of?
