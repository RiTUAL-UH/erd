 Oh my god, now you mention it, I think he might have had two hands on my shoulders at the time as well... 




 More comfy than a finger up the bum, I guess, although it'd depend who you ask. 









 Or second-gear-power-up-wheelstand-level torque. 




 He's awesome, I don't think it's taking anything away from Davis to say that Westbrook would have been absolutely unhinged in the playoffs. 




 Can you imagine the Beastbrook we would have seen in the first round though? Would've been more fun to watch than the Pelis' first wobbly steps. 




 ...but he goes into potato mode and cruises during the regular season.  









 This was all shot with the camera on auto, it's tough to work out exposure etc using a small phone display outdoors.

Immediate things I noticed: DJI Pilot automatically saves the video to your phone/tablet, which absolutely destroys the battery. My Note 4 died before I got the third battery into the Phantom. The ultrasonic sensor/visual positioning thing screws with your shots if you're trying to fly smoothly, best to turn it off or fly in attitude if you're looking for stable footage.

A fair bit of chromatic aberration in the final image, and it really doesn't like being pointed into the sun. I was happy to discover after my phone ran out that it'll fly without the phone connected, and because there's a record button on the controller, you can still film even if you can't see - the last 5 or 6 clips were done blind.

Oh, and it hates taking off on a slanted surface. Out in the bush I couldn't find a totally flat spot for liftoff, and the little "whoosh whoosh" warmup routine it does when you start the props ended up tipping it over. Grrrrr. Anyway hope that's helpful to somebody! 









 Brace yourself for more lead changes than you're gonna be able to deal with.  




 I don't think Bron has peaked yet.  









 Neptune's orbit is the final planet - it's about 4.5 billion kilometers out. Voyager 1 is 19.6 billion km away. So it's more than 4 times further away than the final planet in the system. We tried to illustrate it here at about 5.35:

https://youtu.be/eKiJQ8m3FUo 




 It won't overtake Voyager 1. 









 Doesn't cost heaps? Aw. I want some proper mountains.  




 The key is to buy one before 4, and then microwave it. 




 *dominant 




 That... Made me cry for some reason. 




 Probably fellas without a whole lot of self confidence practicing talking to girls. If they're not being arseholes about it then good on 'em! 




 Worst mistake you can make right now is not calling the brother. Doesn't matter if you have nothing to say. Just offer to help any way you can.  




 Somebody spent a lot of time making that video, and by re-uploading it you've ensured they don't get any youtube revenue, or effectively any credit for their work. People who are interested have no way to find them. I think that's shitty form. 




 The series of plays leading up to "the shot" by MJ - he and Craig Ehlo were trading punches for something like the previous 6 baskets, each one more ridiculous than the last. Ehlo had every right to walk away the winner in that contest, he played his heart out. And that's why that hanging-in-mid-air, freakish dagger was such an incredible finish. 




 Reminds me of my old Hornet 900. Personally I'd like to do something even flatter like the Monster 1200 headlight on mine. But I won't. Because I'm lazy. Kudos to you for pulling your finger out and doing the thing! 




 Do you have a full license, or will you be starting from scratch? You can get a second hand bike from about 3.5k for something decent.  




 Man, he's singing so soft. Again and again that speech level stuff comes up. 




 Don't forget, he coasts like he's on holiday for the first half of the season.  




 He was inspirational. And he had that loose 90s style going on. Always loved watching him play.  




 Happens to me all the time. Be very surprised if you find a way to spin a buck out of it. 




 Borrie seems to have slowed down on those lately... Honestly making good video for the Web is bad business right now. Bloody hard to make it pay for itself. 




 You and I seem forever entwined in Internet comments. Looking forward to your next vids! 




 Glad you liked it - I finally went and put my money where my mouth is and bought one too. :) 




 Well I think that's what everyone's expecting... Me included. But you never know, maybe he's one of those sensitive types who just needed somebody to believe in him... And fellate him endlessly. And he sure seems to have found that. 




 Maybe if he spends four times more than the cap on salaries, the best player in the world will have a stacked enough team to win.  




 Just imagine if this tidal wave of positivity actually works... DJ starts believing the hype train and acting like he's a few key skills away from being the best center img the world. He's knocking on the door of the shooting coaches. He's doing the Olajuwon camp and getting post moves together... Who knows, I can see some bizarre universe where this kind of kick in the arse/kiss on the arse actually motivates him to get better.  




 I took one out for a couple days back when they were still solvent - they're a nice ride! 




 Supposed to be a lot better than the FZ09/MT09. 




 10C is a great product - but it's not as good a headset as the 20S, and it's not as good a camera as a GoPro. The headset is similar in quality and usability to the SMH-10, so it's no bad thing, it just doesn't have the huge 2km range and voice controls of the 20S.

If you don't need pro quality vision I think it's an awesome and very convenient piece of kit. Very easy to use. 




 Why would anyone care?  




 There's no such thing as bad publicity. She's becoming a household name.  




 Dominique's 2-handed windmill blew my young mind.  




 I don't think he'd fit in. Needs a more punchable face.  




 Can somebody explain why you guys give a shit who tweets this crap first?  




 Black skin, asian eyes.  




 In your face AGAIN Danny.  




 SBK is by far the better event to attend for the Australian round. Less people paying to be seen there, less corporate clowns, more motorcycle lovers. You can ride your bike around the outside of the track and go to a bunch of different spots on the day. 




 There's nothing cool about something so contrived. 




 It's just so contrived, he's going the other direction and he turns around deliberately so he can step over Varejao and manufacture an Iverson/Pippen moment. Sorry, but I see this and just think 'wanker.' 




 We were all hoping he'd go to the Bulls and give whatever shitty superteam Lebron is on at least SOME contest on the march to the finals. 




 He does come across... A bit malignant. 




 You're like my nephew when he was 1. Ball was his only word for about 2 months. Everything was a fucking ball. 




 Coming for wintertime? Rug up, mate. Melbourne doesn't really freeze, but our winters are fucking depressing. 




 https://youtu.be/6Ua_oJfpQWY 




 Between the two of them they might get a whole 82 games. 




 Wait for Lebron to decide not to run the offense.  




 I wish I'd had the foresight to take a photo so the turd could thank you poosonally.  




 Great piece. Foul and educational. A great combo, you have improved my morning shit immeasurably.  




 The Maron interview sheds a lot of light on this. I don't think you can relegate this guy to "he just does fart jokes" status. Between Wayne's World, Austin Powers and Shrek alone he's created what, 10 or 12 brilliant characters that have all crossed straight into pop culture. The guy is a genius and his vision is incredibly strong. If he wants to fight for his ideas I think he's earned the right.  




 I think we should all be thankful Donald Sterling never realised he could call his team that.  




 NUCULAR 




 A rich, young, famous and disgraced millionaire, at least to start with. His last few bits of task national exposure were spent making a fool of himself.  




 He's a wonderful combination of arrogant, I'm-the-best-fear-my-wrath bluster, mixed with a comically mercenary habit of ditching his team to play with other huge talents or recruiting like mad to stack his own team. There's nothing organic or real about the teams he won titles with, and this year he "came home" by gutting the shit out of Cleveland's roster and stacking that to the rafters as well. 

I respect his court vision, his outrageous physical gifts and his ability to make big plays at important times, but I hate his bullying style of driving to the rim and just bashing his way in. There's nothing pretty about the way he finishes to me. 

I love nothing more than watching him get shat on, looking forward to seeing it again, hopefully in an earlier round of the playoffs. Also looking forward to watching Cleveland struggle with massive salary issues in the wake of GM James wanting more talent and more money at the same time.

 I think he's deleted his account? 




 Pfffffft deleted his account? 




 I noted a lot of love for SoTC on here so I went and bought it... Didn't even finish it - and I'm a compulsive game finisher. Shadow of the Colossus and the God of War games are the only things I can remember playing in recent times that I couldn't bring myself to finish. 




 I dunno about this for LA. Matt Barnes is a good enforcer, a grit guy with that bit of desperation and edge the Clippers sometimes struggle for. Their best wing defender too, he's gonna be missed a lot more than Hawes. 




 Yeah, a Lebron heave is actually a good shot for the Warriors. They're OK with how this is going. 




 Lebron is playing against a defense here that has decided not to double him, even when he's posting up a guard. They've picked their poison and decided to let him score.  




 I haven't ridden an H2, I'm sure they're berserk as well. H2R even more so.  




 You're saying this like he doesn't already. 




 Lebron shooting is still a good outcome for GS - he's shooting terribly. 14 for 34 tonight. Golden State's offense is what's killing them. 




 Present! 




 It doesn't matter, the strobe freezes the action.  




 My missus has learned and mastered the stretch'n'rake. I can't imagine a more luxurious way to start the morning than having somebody else expertly scratch your ballbag.  




 ...but the vast majority of the world went through the Gretzky era and still gave no fucks about hockey. 




 Seems like harrassment needs to become part of the D strategy for GSW - they've got the manpower to annoy him if necessary. 




 I spent last week doing my RPA license course... I don't think unlicensed operators are gonna realise just how much controlled airspace there is. Here's a quick look at Melbourne, for example, the first legal bits of sky are out as far as Brighton or Williamstown. Forget about going North, there's a wide controlled zone around Melbourne airport. http://i.imgur.com/jIbQAUG.jpg

People are just going to break the laws that are left, and not get caught. CASA seems insanely understaffed as it is (it's taking them 6 months to put a stamp on an Operator Certificate at the moment) - there's no way they'll be chasing every guy with 2 drone shots in his video that look like they were taken near a building, or within 3 nautical miles from a helipad.

Meanwhile, those of us that slogged through the process will still be obliged to plan, risk assess and log every flight and the charge levels of our batteries, wait our 30 days for area approvals and whatnot. I dunno how rational it's all looking to be honest. 




 Not only that, they're slowing the tempo enough to get rest on offense. 




 I forgot all about that! Awesome! 




 Original bet here: http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2seq1l/nba_on_espn_warriors_are_now_305_of_18_previous/cnow5qi?context=3

Damnit, I should have hedged with a bet on the cavs too, so that my burning hate and fury if they win would at least be slightly quenched by some guy running around in a cockenballs hat. 




 True! The exception not the rule though. I hope he gets a bit of mongrel into him. 




 He's a bit of a humbledunker at this point, I'd like to see him get a bit nastier.  




 He's French. That's like borrowing a set of spanners over there.  




 With no regard for human kneecap.  




 He's a bit of a freak.  




 You almost want your bigs to start late. Less mileage on the joints!  




 To be fair it was an impact injury not an aggravation of his tendinitis.  




 And what if he drops his bundle like last year?  




 Better not star Jack Marston. 




 That's how the king operates though. Looking forward to seeing what new team stacking measures are undertaken in the off season. It just makes him so easy to root against.  




 I got to 3 minutes once in a particularly boring English class.  




 Wow.  




 Acknowledged and enjoyed. He's trash.  




 Don't forget Tristan Thompson. Every time the warriors got a rebound it felt like a fluke.  




 You are quite the diplomat.  




 That was a pretty shit game by the warriors. I felt they were lucky to take it. Steph never got going and they needed a couple of Iggy threes to stay in the hunt.

Lebron beasted, Thompson made me feel like golden state was lucky to get a defensive board, Smith regressed to the mean and the whole Cavs team dropped their bundle when Kyrie went down.  




 Good luck to the guy if they ever charge him and it gets to the papers. He'll never sleep another sound night.  




 Fuckin' pricks. Ruined a $500 set of motorcycle tyres.  




 To me this reads more like a power play. He's basically calling her a whore and naming an insulting price. This is a cunt of a man trying to assert dominance over a woman and remind her of her place. It's pretty fucking gross behavior.  




 Thanks mate!  




 That track just leaves me in awe. The whole album does. William Orbit is a genius.  




 You didn't scroll far enough, it got kinda heated in here! ;) But cheers.  




 Mucho appreciande!  




 It's amazing. Last week I posted a musical fart that got 2 million views, and the comments were overwhelmingly positive. 




 Twas dad. I chopped the video up a bit to keep it short and stuck bits of audio on top of each other, so you're hearing my voice from one bit and my beats from another. Lucky we stayed in the groove!  




 Don't worry, he's totally gross, full of dirt and bugs and healthy as an ox. :) 




 Yeah just thought it'd give people a smile. But it's a fair point!  




 I'll have a look in the morning.  




 Babies are naked heaps. Any awkwardness is a sad reflection on modern values.  




 No idea. It's a fairly new bathroom though.  




 Yeah I'm with you now. This post has been a learning experience.  




 I was feeling guilty about making a video my kid will be mortified about when he's a teenager. Now it turns out it's a PSA about electrocuting babies.  




 Baby was not electrocuted, but I think we can all agree it was a dumbass thing to do and not recommended. Our parenting skills are an example of why there should be reproduction license tests.  




 Probably have to post video to a different sub.  




 Righto cheers! Last thing I'd want is for somebody else to go zap their kid. Actually that's the second last really.  




 I think we're safe, it's meant to be stuck in wet stuff. 

Edit: NOT SAFE. 




 HALLLLOOOOOO
