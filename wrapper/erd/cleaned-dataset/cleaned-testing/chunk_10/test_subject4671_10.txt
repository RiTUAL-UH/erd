 What ways did you find it better than the first? Did it have more action? was it faster moving? no spoilers if possible ^.^ 




 I started this book after Sanderson doing a great job of finishing the wheel of time series.  To be honest I expected something very similar to the Wheel of Time books in this book. Instead I found a very intriguing world that was slowly built up. There was a lack of "action" but i always found myself interested in where the story was taking me and as clues fell into place I started to piece together the larger story. I'm very interested to see where the 2nd book goes from here and if develops in the same way. 




 i think the big twist is that brock put in his rematch clause and any technical rematch should have roman reigns since he was in the first match 




 and the engaged on the lulu and the reksai...which gragas and ali...no chance of killing either of those two..those last 3 fights were painful. 




 That's a very helpful link. I think I could have bought the flying courier since at 4:31 i bought sage's mask as part of my soul ring recipe. 




 Inivisible Man by Ralph Ellison. Read during High School at a point in time where I did not have a lot of confidence and was struggling with my identity... I'll always love the quote:

"And my problem was that I always tried to go in everyones way but my own. I have also been called one thing and then another while no one really wished to hear what I called myself. So after years of trying to adopt the opinions of others I finally rebelled. I am an invisible man" 




 I haven't seen anyone talking about it so I figured I'd post it to at least get the convo started... 









 Recently I played a game as support Skywrath. http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1596931228

At the end of the game I have Eul's, Force Staff, Scythe of Vyse, soul ring, Tranquil Boots, and Agh's. This was a hour long game but I feel like i have too many items. I placed at least 8 wards during the game since that was my compendium challenge, I know had some sentries for a while that i was using to secure vision in certain areas like near Rosh. I pulled some camps during the start of the game..I just feel like I didnt buy enough sentries or was missing something i should have been doing.

I bought my items for the following reasons:
soul ring + tranquils: allows me to harass in lane a lot while keeping mana up

eul's: my idea was to hopefully eul's the sk while he was channelling epi or keep me to safe to allow my cooldowns to come back up

force: maneuverability/safety for carries

scythe: the enemy team had a storm that was carrying..wanted to use my silence + scythe to focus him down

aghs: late game had 4k gold just chilling there 




 Duclaw Sweet baby jesus beer is very chocolatey 




 I've been watching a couple streams including HR's recent dotapit match against C9 where they picked Huskar. Huskar is part of my Compendium 10 hero challenge so I was particularly interested in this match. Thoroughout the match the commentators frequently commented about how good Huskar's "Armlet Toggling" was. From context clue's I figured it has to do with the active of Armlet but what is it? Why is it good? How should Huskar correctly use it? 




 i think if Freddy keeps pushing with the minions sk wins... 




 as long as you have just black coffee you should be fine..if you add sugar and creamers then you just need to account for those calories over time...

as for what your eating...i would guess that you are probably not eating "too few" calories as most people underestimate calories they are eating especially when it comes to snacks. 

but here's real talk..are you taking pictures of yourself every 30 days? Are you taking measurements(ie waste size, bicep size) every 30 days? If all you're doing is looking at the scale you may "see the results" but you will be getting them.

If i recall correctly I had a maybe 5-10lb change after the whole 90 days..but my body looked significantly different

 Hi! I play League as well(Silver 4 noob) and will try to address some of your questions.

* playing support is one of the most knowledged based roles in dota2. Similar to how in league you need to know how to ward/keep dragon nashor timers/keep flash timers/level 2 rush there is a lot to know in dota2(smoke, dust, sentries, ward positions, jungle pulls). I would avoid playing hard support until you get a little more familiarity with the game

* Similar to LoL, bots is useful for playing a hero for the first time and figuring out how that hero works. If you go against a hero and are having a hard time play that hero in a bot game to figure out his skills

* if you are having a hard time with builds dota has an answer for that once you enter the game [click the book in the upper left hand corner](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/l0k2TUvkc4E/maxresdefault.jpg). this will provide you with a selection of the highest recommended builds which usually have item progressions as well as explanations for that item. Also it even highlights the ability it suggests you learn at each level

hopefully some of these tips will help you out :) 




 If you like bbc show's i highly recommend Orphan Black and Broadchurch 









 ok i think the ground toss was my issue thank you
 




 i know it says that but like i said sometimes i'll have another player right next to me and it wont let me cast it. Do i have to have my reticle on the character i want to throw or in the direction i want to throw them? both ways seem to not work consistently for me
 




 how on earth do i get tiny's toss to do what i want...I'll have characters right next to me and it wont throw them or anything 




 and giving up wide open layups for 3s 




 ooh...whoosh..I'm...nevermind 




 i think you mean 

    if (greaterBashChance = DEFAULT_BASH_CHANCE)

the way you have it written would mean a 83% chance of doing greater bash 




 he also missed the 7 steps super obvious travel that happened right before that.... 




 NME really struggled to break into TDK's base. Bard was just throwing ultis out that had no chance of hitting...the poor play in the game led to phreak deciding to making it pun time with phreak and it was just bad. 




 It's germ thing. It's the reason he always fist bumps when they go to the opponents. 




 I highly suggest Powers by Brian Michael Bendis. The story is set in a world where superheroes/supervillians exist and follows the story of two cops in that world that are assigned to cases dealing with those with "Powers"

if you like Watchmen you may also like V for Vendetta, The League of Extraordinary Gentleman. 

The Frank Miller Daredevil is also quite good and I personally like Batman Knightfall 




 I also think the ryze vs mao matchup is poor for ryze bc his constant spells trigger mao's passive a lot and mao has good engage/lockup for ganks 




 you should show your wife a Roy Nelson UFC fight and watch her head explode lol 




 its also on $60 on amazon...http://www.amazon.com/Locke-Key-Slipcase-Set-Hill/dp/1631401394

i just bought this a couple weeks ago :) 









 i'm almost mad i bought the Locke and Key physical set a couple weeks ago...almost lol 




 if you lack energy but feel full i would suggest raising your carbs slightly(add a sweet potato to breakfast or lunch)

EDIT: also if you dont usually eat clean and are switching to clean eating, the first 10 days you can expect to feel a little groggy as you're basically going through detox on sugars 




 i use Optimum Nutrition protein powder with almond milk, I use a real blender so i add banana and lots of spinach to mine too 




 I believe PapaSmithy is able to do a good(not great) level of PBP. They question is whether the extra analysis makes up for a potential dip in PBP 




 where are you watching the episodes from? I cant find a legal way to watch season 2 right now :( 




 np, actually watching your OHP video it looks like your overarching your back..watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExgCyO0s9m0) and notice how her back stays rigid 




 not sure it's a big issue but I would work on having a solid foundation when unracking the weight. On a squat get into a squat position under the bar and then lift to make sure you are in good position...same with OHP, get into that front rack position like a front squat and then use legs to lift weight out of rack

squat: crank your elbows down a bit, this is going to help you keep your frame upright. on a couple reps(especially the last one) it appeared like the weight got forward of you and you were doing a good morning 




 here's the link to my p90x results: http://imgur.com/a/6lGX5

I've also done SS, ICF, and then have done crossfit for 2 years. What I've found is that whatever motivates you to get into the gym/workout consistently is what's the "best" and gets you the best results.

If you want to try to do p90x and money is no issue I would HIGHLY suggest doing the p90x/Insanity hyrbid plan to get most results quickly 




 first person to get title right!  




 honestly i almost posted this picture to /r/mildlyinfuriating just for that reason 




 Every 6k "health miles" we get a $25 gift card to a business on a approved list. You can get 100 health miles just for being active for a 45 minute span with out stopping or 120 health miles if you go 12k steps in a day(roughly 5-6 miles) etc etc 




 I haven't..but it's was suggested to me from the same person who suggested I try Powers and Preacher and i enjoyed both those 




 yup. was priced at $99 a couple weeks ago. They lowered it to [$60](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1631401394) and my work gives us amazon gift cards based off wearing a pedometer and how far we walk :)  




 You replied to me in 2 places but i'll condense my reply here :). While I agree for heroes the 96k number looks good the question is "Is it a good number for ESPN2?" ESPN2 averaged 212k viewers on Sunday and a 30for30 repeat last week in the same time spot averaged 300k+ viewers. I'm just not sure if the 96k makes ESPN2 more likely to show another Heroes event. If that entire 96k is in the 18-35 demo then it might be a win for ESPN2 based on how highly they covet that demo
 









 according to the link below and rerun of a 30for30 documentary from 9:30-10pm on April 19 had 313k viewers:

 I'm not sure if you can answer this but how are player contracts set to pay out? Does a player who is a starter week 1 make the same amount if they are relegated to the bench? Or is pay based on performance? 




 a replay of a basketball game got the same veiwership...i actaully view this number as bad :-/
https://twitter.com/Ourand_SBJ/status/593110495189676032 




 worse:
https://twitter.com/Ourand_SBJ/status/593110495189676032 




 i would disagree:
https://twitter.com/Ourand_SBJ/status/593110495189676032 




 i actually used this line on my current gf...can confirm it works 




 fun fact..McDonalds registers dont allow you to order more than 99 of any one item in a single order...or at least that was the case in 2006 when we ordered 102 cheeseburgers 




 and Jae Crowder(who's been doing great this playoffs) and a 1st round draft pick and 2nd round draftpick(not like we need young legs anyways)..oh and Jameer nelson's carcass 




 thanks for creating these..is it possible to get end game pics that have items vs gold total? even if it's a few seconds before the game actually end i feel the item pic would be preferred :) 




 i started getting this around the time the mass friend request spam was happening and it hasnt gone away since then 




 Honestly I was happy..I never liked any of those characters..especially Lady stark 




 i was having issues with the network and did the following to fix my issues:

right click on video-choose settings-make sure the "enable hardware acceleration" option is NOT selected. Refresh stream 




 what about the game freeze on log in that came with the invites? I'm still getting the freeze even though invites aren't happening 




 That 3rd dragon was definitely not worth...should of just gave it up and turtled..went from 2k gold deficit to 10k deficit 




 I'm pretty sure it is not an april fools joke 




 wasn't super impressed with him in their game vs ODU. He is good shooting the 3 when going to his right and didnt look overly physical/atheletic 




 true but i wasn't watching the teams twitters. i only went there because the message from them during live broadcast 




 he was checking twitter bc they told us on bradcast to specifically follow lolesports to find when VOD would be available.. 




 Same I'm quite frustrated 




 incredibly frustrating 




 I was really happy to learn MSI was on east coast and then instantly disappointed when it was in Tallahassee  




 they are gonna be awfully disappointed if they expect Sheamus to be cheered at WM 




 ah my last match is almost exactly a month ago so that makes sense 




 yes 




 except now there are no item drops :( 




 they made it so you couldn't warp high ground with out vision of it and you couldn't warp on ramp to get high ground vision..as soon as that change went in 4 gate basically disappeared 




 there is no LCS this week 




 I'm not saying he shouldn't get the undergrad degree..I'm saying real world experience pays the bills a lot more than a PhD would. 




 bad idea to get a PhD in computer science unless you are wanting to be a professor. In computer science the amount your paid is usually directly related to your real world experience coding. You would benefit better from starting to learn some type of programming on your own(ie create a github project where you develop an android app, create a video game using the newly free Unreal Engine 4,etc)
 




 I'm surprised you dont have any FABLES. How is Locke and Key? I'm starting to think about grabbing it 




 but in bot lane for instance you can trade trinket ward coverage of tri with your adc to have pretty constant vision..so still not reportable 




 I dont know the actual position for the 3D groups but you would want something like simulation engineer. In case you aren't aware of it:
http://nasajobs.nasa.gov/ 




 I have a double degree in electrical and computer engineering with a minor in modeling and simulation 




  RAM is synonymous with memory and the more of it you have the more programs can be running at any one point on your computer.
