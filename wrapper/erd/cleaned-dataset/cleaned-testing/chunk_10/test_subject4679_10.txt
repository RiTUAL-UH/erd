 I agree that in the somewhat improved reporting environment it is more difficult to claim revolutionary benefits from a marginal drug. Given that so many of the psychoactive medications have been so disappointing from a short-term perspective, and often alarming from a long-term one, the field must look unpromising to many companies. 

You are also right that the dominant driving neurochemical theories behind depression have not been supported, making it difficult to know where to look for a new antidepressant. 

The problem is not limited to psychopharmacology, however. My understanding is that new "blockbuster" drugs are becoming harder and harder to find in all fields. This means either declining prospects for the pharmaceutical companies - or an increased motive to cheerlead and overmarket the products they have. 














 Yes, the DSM people seem to be on track to the creation of the "perfect" manual: One in which all of us will be able to find ourselves and thereby self-identify as mentally ill. 




 This is a nicely thought-out argument that I think has some real validity. You may be interested to read Alain de Botton's excellent book "The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work" which includes a discussion of this idea of disconnection from the products of one's work life. 














 I would agree that the quality of diagnostic work has not gone up overall. Most people are given a diagnosis after a very short unstructured discussion of a few minutes, and a screening tool such as the PHQ9 that should not be used for diagnosis.

Whereas formerly depression may often have been missed, however, today it is more likely to be identified where it is not present. There have been some studies indicating that the majority of people identified as suffering from depression do not meet criteria. As well, the criteria themselves have been expanded since the 1950s - though I do not believe this can account for all of the increase in numbers.

At our clinic, the majority of people referred with a diagnosis of major depression do not seem, with structured interview, to meet nor to have ever met the diagnostic criteria for the disorder. When it comes to bipolar 2 disorder, that number climbs to, at a guess, closer to 75%. 




 The GAPS diet is one of many broad-range idea systems developed and promoted by an iconoclastic originator and promoted via the internet. For those interested, here is a skeptical view:

 Certainly in the 1950s this kind of thing wasn't looked for with any regularity and I do think much was missed back then. 

I'm not sure, though, that we are getting so much better at diagnosis. Most of the clients I am referred with a diagnosis of Major Depression (on the basis of 5 minute GP interview or PHQ9 questionnaire) do not, with proper structured interview, turn out to have (or have ever had) MDD. I suspect we're getting better at OVER diagnosis, and at pathologizing normal reactive declines in mood and then encouraging the sale of products (including medications) for these. Nowhere is this more evident than in the recent fad diagnosis of Bipolar 2 Disorder, but I think that unipolar depression is also being over-recognized and prematurely medicated.

Most of the outcome literature on antidepressant medication is based on short-term response, with the assumption being that this gives us an indication what long-term outcomes will be. But the evidence favouring long-term maintenance treatment with antidepressants (or antidepressant-antipsychotic cocktails - which seem easier to get in Vancouver than margaritas) has always been shaky. 

Could down-regulation (reactive to medication) in serotonergic and noradrenergic systems be accounting for some of the increased chronicity and poorer interepisode recovery? 









 Something chemical is surely going on with every psychological experience we have - so if someone asks "does depression have a chemical component" the answer is always yes. So does love.

The biochemical imbalance explanation derives from the marketing wing of the pharmaceutical companies, not from the research wing. I regard it as a litmus test of the quality of care: If a healthcare provider says something to the effect of "You have a biochemical imbalance" they simply do not know the literature and should not be treating the disorder.

There have been many attempts to nail down the supposed biochemical aspect of depression, to no real avail. There is no serotonin deficiency, nor excess of monoamine oxidase, nor excessive reuptake transporters, as far as we can tell. 

The SSRIs DO work for some of the people who take them in both the short and long term. Others find they help short term but are ineffective long term. Still others find the long term results are worse than not having the medications. And increasingly the pattern is to react to nonresponse by raising dosage or adding supplementary medications such as antipsychotics - significantly ramping up the risk or actuality of side effects while augmenting any antidepressant effect very little if at all.

I often ask patients and providers if there is any "off-signal" - a sign that perhaps medication is not going to prove helpful and perhaps the best course is to withdraw medications gradually and work another way. I have never yet had anyone say "yes." But I keep asking. 




 Relax, breathe, and say what comes to mind. Let it be incoherent. Part of the role of therapy is to help you sort through the confusion that everyone's life is. Like having "Mobile Maids" come and help you clean up after a cyclone. 




 Oh, and no one expects you to open up completely the first time you meet a therapist. That's not compliance - that's not having any boundaries. Feel free to save up some stuff for when you trust them more and get a sense you can work with them. Don't wait too long, though, or you can waste a lot of time in therapy working on less-central issues.
 




 Thank your physician for talking you into this prior to working with medication dosage. 

A first appointment with a counsellor (I am one) usually involves an attempt to understand what's basically going on. My own assessment can be summed by a few basic questions:

What have you been experiencing that brings you here?
What has the course of this problem been (when did it start, intensify, etc)?
What was going on around the time it started or worsened?
What seems to help so far, if anything?
Did anything improve or worsen when other treatment began?
What's your guess about what's really going on here?
What would you most like to get out of seeing me?

None of those can be answered completely in one short session, and no good therapist will expect you to be completely organized. But thinking about those questions in advance will usually help you make the most of your first meeting. 

Note, though, that the first meeting is not usually much about treatment - it's more of an info-gathering session. Expect more of an initial sketch of suggested approaches in session 2. 




 Your description sounds very much like the reactions described in Robert Whitaker's Anatomy of an Epidemic. I can't offer any advice, but I think it's useful for people to ask which of their symptoms was present before being on medication, which only appeared after they began medication, and which disappeared or reduced as an apparent result of medication - and for how long (given that some medication effects, even beneficial ones - are short-acting). This can help with treatment decision-making.
