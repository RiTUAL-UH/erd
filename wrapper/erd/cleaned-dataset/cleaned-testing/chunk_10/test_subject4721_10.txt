 This is why I love reddit, thanks! 




 Check comments, someone posted them :) 














 I saved the pic from a blog post a while ago but when I looked for more info this morning the blog had been reorganized or something and I couldn't find any info. I thought it was from the AVG in China Air Force in early WWII 





























 I heard there was a Twins part 2 in the works with the possibility of Eddie Murphy as an unknown brother? Sounds good to me. 




 Yea, you can't edit a title once it's posted and I didn't want to go through the hassle of deleting and reposting. People seem to be having some fun with it so I left it. Have a boon day! 




 I would have them pick one to be read to them at night. As a kid when I stayed with my grandparents at their cabin upstate they let me pick a book for them to read to me from their book shelf. To this day I get the feels whenever I watch Princess Bride. 




 Shit.

 There's always someone who just understands what he's doing and is passionate about what they do, check these out and you'll see why he's so popular. He was also in the movie Chef if you saw that. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmTzdMHu5KU 









 Sweet!

 Thanks, I do like the sound of a click, so satisfying. 




 Yea it looks great. Just found this sub but it already looks like a lot of fun. The guys who can actually use a pad without letters and numbers boggle my mind! 




 THANKS! That's exactly what I was hoping looking for! 




 I was really hoping that wouldn't be the case. 




 Been watching videos for a while now and it finally got out of Beta, joined, got a ship and played in two battles before I had to give up or the laptop was going out the window. It's a 2007 Toshiba Satellite X205-S7483 Laptop setup for Gaming but I didn't play any games (is an XBox player) but I'm hoping it's not going to be to hard to upgrade. Any advice is really helpful, thanks. There's a Micro Center in my neighborhood I'm heading to soon but I thought I would ask here first, thanks. 




 Joined World of Warships and it looks like a bad wii game, lagging, freezing. how hard is it going to be to try upgrading the video card, laptop itself to play really well? 




 i really like some of the boards you guys have set up and I'm hoping to get some good ideas. I want to write alot and play World of Warships on my laptop. Love the wooden boards! 




 New to this great subreddit and I'm looking to (hopefully) upgrade 2007 Toshiba Satellite Laptop for online gaming and I hope you guys can help with some recommendations. Thanks. 














 Right, now that's a food fair! I'm hoping that Anthony Bourdain, who really appreciates this kind of street food, that when he puts his food pavilion together it will be with this kind of stuff http://ny.eater.com/2015/4/9/8376063/bourdain-market-anthony-bourdain-new-york-city 














 Bingo! 














 Wow, who would do that? And why? 




 It's how I ordered a chicken sandwich at my local joint in Brooklyn. They make it with pickled turnip which is to hard to eat but overall a great sandwich.  









 I mean what do you do, Get a hose or just pull up next to an open hydrant? 




 Ohh, that come hither look! 














 I hope they had a sense of humor about it. 









 Happened to me once when I was following a large truck through a flooded area and he decides that would be a good time to stop in the middle of it to lean out and take a pic. The wave back washed even higher than the normal level and I got stuck. Parked it after tow on high ground, turned out the tailpipe and muffler got filled, replaced that and drove it for 5 more years. Check the muffler. 




 Like I needed another reason to go to Spain. Those are now on the list, thanks! 









 Does it have to be today? Recently http://imgur.com/7201BYm and I did upvote the "fuck you pay me" because Goodfellas!

 Surprisingly not overly sweet but with a real butterscotch taste to it. Plus it was ice cold and just hit the spot after eating tons of olives, sharp cheeses and pate. It's made by the same people who make Reed's Ginger Brew, if you like a strong ginger ale you have to try it! http://reedsinc.com/ 




 Just surfing youtube and no I didn't film it. Sorry. 









 I was an EMT working the tri state area but the base was in New Jersey, after a while I was trusted to take the ambulance home, I lived in Brooklyn. Having sex in the back of the ambulance while on the clock is an incredible thrill that I miss. 




 I believe it's prepared the French way and I think the cheese is cheddar and brie. I'm hoping someone sees this and knows exactly what's in it and how it's made. 




 The two main floors plus the smaller (only about 100 vendors) room to the right on the ground level. We got there right after they opened and when they flicked the lights to let us know they were closing we still hadn't seen everything. That's why it's three days long. I just wished I was able to go everyday but that was impossible this year. Try going to the International Restaurant and Equipment Show when it comes next year, you can eat better there also, if a company's got an oven to try and sell you he's gonna have fresh pizza or meat on a grill all day long. Plus when I got my badge scanned i got a 1lb package of Apple Wood Smoked Bacon from a Wisconsin Company as a surprise a month later. Saved that for BLT on the wife's birthday! Last year there was a Canadian company trying to introduce their answer to a pastrami sandwich, they sell you a case of already cooked flash frozen prepared pastrami in an 8oz plastic bag, just have a pot of boiling water ready and when a customer wants a sandwich just pop one or two in the water depending on the size of your sandwich and wait for a few minutes until reheated and wham, a hot pastrami sandwich on order with no waste and no need to worry about expiration dates. Plus the pastrami was pretty good. I'll check to see if I have any pics from that show. Again it's just for professionals only. 









 About 10 minutes but I bet the duck on the bottom is nice and crispy and the hunk of cheese on top is just melted enough! Mouthwatering! 









 There were a few Honey products and companies but I don't remember them offhand, sorry. Friends? 




 the pics look great but the food tasted even better!

 I love the work that you guys have done with the bus. I'm sad that I can't help with the insurance but I'm hoping that you get help here and please keep posting your progress on that as well as your trip. I also have never seen your toilet set up before, what kind is it? As a fan who is seriously considering either a school bus conversion or a Tiny House on a trailer I love posts like these because of all the help they provide. GOOD LUCK!

 I think your supposed to reach around from the second floor. 




 Why not? It looks like he's got the momentum and everybody loves her and wants her to run, why not join forces? America may not be truly ready for a woman president but for vice president, maybe? 









 I think they took a pine box, cut it at an angle then used them to build a staircase with them. 





























 But it would drive me crazy! 









 OK Now that makes sense!
