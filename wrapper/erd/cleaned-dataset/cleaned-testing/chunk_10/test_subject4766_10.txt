 well what else should I have said, I was bored? because thats the only other way to describe it. Much of Age of Ultron was boring and dull.  




 Not sure about you guys but I'm getting a bit tired of the avengers fighting a large army I'm hoping infinity war will rectify that with Thanos all I want is the aveners vs Thanos thats it.But with AOU I think I was starting to get a bit superhero fatigue because there were just so many heroes involved. 

I like how Ant-Man went back to basics. It was small up close and personal and it was a solid origin story and it was just overall a more enjoyable film for me. 









 Christoph Waltz will be the main villain in spectre while Andrew Scott will be teased and introduced in spectre as the man behind the mask sorta thing the guy pulling the strings the puppeteer if you will and hell be the main villain in bond 25.  




 someones salty. jelous you wont be going? aw.  




 wow. thats nuts.  














 Ill be pissed if winter soldier was just a fluke and the russo brothers end up being the worst directors ever . 




 no 









 Damn I forgot how good the first season was. So many great moments. The hood vs the dark archer, the introduction of the huntress. Slade Wilson, Shadow. what are your favorite moments from season 1? 




 its the beard. 




 The game was announced for ps4 last year for those that didn't know http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/08/12/day-z-coming-to-playstation-4 




 correct me if i'm wrong but from the looks of things the game is pretty much dead on PC but id still like to give it a go on ps4 if it ever comes out. Has there been any updates on the ps4 version?
 




 Actually feige said marvel will do it if audiences want it. "a supercool idea for the next Ant-Man film, and if audiences want it, well find a place to do it."

 If ant-man 2 happens 2018 would be the most logical date. There is usually 2 years inbetween marvel sequels. That means marvel would be moving 2 4 films a year. How crazy would that be. 




 So I watched this a couple of nights ago and I gotta say its now one of my favorite DC animated movies. The plot twist was pretty predictable but that didn't take away from the movie though.Some people say the joker was miscast in this but I actually enjoyed the voice actor they chose same for Batman both were really solid.

Its a great animated feature and you guys should most definitely watch it.  




 well just know that your opinion is in the minority so id probably keep that to yourself.  




 The game seriously needs this. The fun factor runs out quickly when you keep playing against players who are more skilled then you.  




 clearly you havent seen many movies then. Skyfall was no where near terrible.  




 Its part of the same universe. Daredevil even references the battle of new york.  









 Are they going to do phases like marvel or just have one massive story arc across a various number of movies? 









 After Winter Soldier I feel like they would be a perfect fit for another  techno-thriller Iron Man movie. Forget Iron Man 3 ever happened. RDJ has spoken very highly of the russo brothers and it seems like he gets along really well with them. Marvel needs to make this happen.  




 Have to agree. It was still enjoyable but I found some parts kind of boring.  




 I know they premiered at StarWars celebration or something like that but has anything been said about a wider release? id love to see ROTS again and in 3D.  














 I found this gem. 

margot robbie is ugly, a bad actress, a home wrecker in real life, and has no charisma to be harley quinn. So many women that have pulled harley quinn off at comic cons, yet hollywood butchered her in this film... Lets see if she acts like an airhead and says funny shit like the real character does... And will smith (which was/is having an affair with margot robbie in real life, since focus) will always be a comedian and suck at being a serious actor... He doesn't even look like deadshot... I guarantee they will both be each other's love interest (again) in this film, since joker is out of the suicide squad. Deadshot should not be a black man... If they made luke cage into a white man, people would cry racism. Then you have ben affleck as batman as the "good" likely protagonist that could never be as good as micheal keaton... The joker doesn't even appear to be the joker... Lets see how charismatic he will be like ledger or nicholson... Killer croc is too small... This is the worst cast i have ever seen for any comic film... And i really wanted to like this film, but the cast killed it... I'm sick and tire of you assholes responding to me when you know i'm going to delete your comment by deleting this one and pasting it again without you shit talking... Let me express myself and leave me alone!!!
 




 I'm pretty sure my IQ just dropped like 50 points reading some of the comments on the Suicide Squad and Batman V Superman trailers. Damn are people stupid.  




 They certainly would have made use of the joker in the dark knight rises. I believe he was supposed to make a cameo.  









 I'm not sure what you could do story wise but if they ever did announce anything like that would you guys watch it? 














 eh I liked amazing spider-man 1 as do a lot of other people.  









 So why is it I can "stream" 3x07 now? is canada still getting it on Thursdays? 




 Ant-man all day everyday. Train Wreck looks good tho . 









 OP did when he said the premise was the same when its not.  




 Suicide Squad is not based on assault on arkham. Its a new story.  




 eh. amazing spider-man 1 and thor 2 are good. but ill agree with amazing spider-man 2.  














 LOL thats so 2007 




 what the actual fuck.  




 ive seen that one thats messed up.  









 Missed out again! The dream is dead.  









 Not every great movie is released at the cinemas. What are some of your favorites that went straight to vod or dvd? 









 Do I try and explain the MCU to her or do I let her watch it first and then answer any questions she has? How have you guys delt with people watching their first MCU movie?  




 Are there any good stories out there of such a thing happening? 




 Avengers.  



















 David Fincher would be my first choice with Aaron Sorkin writing.  









 no he teased it. he said "old man logan, read into that what you will and laughed it off"  




 Wouldn't it be a smart move if Civil War was the first in a line of team up movies outside the avengers? It would kind of make sense to help introduce new superheroes into the MCU like Doctor Strange by having another hero like Spider-Man or Iron Man make a cameo or have a supporting role along side the new hero to introdce them to the MCU?

 




 I just cant stand them they look so ugly. I dont understand how people like them. Please tell me I'm not alone. FYI i'm talking about these http://www.lg.com/us/ultrawide-monitors 




 Id like to have seen the map the day the batman v superman trailer released. it was arguably the better trailer but suicide squad still looks awesome the trailer just didn't live up to the BvS comic-con trailer.  




 it was but their still airing the rest of the season.  




 Chris Evans? you wot m8.  









 Zodiac - The fact we still don't know who the killer is might have something to do with it so there is still that mystery element there

Sunshine - The adrenaline rush you get at the end when shit starts going down and you dont know if the crews plan will work. 

 









 Did you even read my post? thats what this is about. I hope marvel learns from WB and releases their stuff to the public and not try to keep it exclusive like WB did with suicied squad it only hurt their reputation. they should of released it straight away like the batman v superman trailer. Rather than try and keep it comic-con exclusive.  









 So D23 is coming up and Disney and Marvel are rumored to show the first trailer for Civil War. This past weekend comic-con happened and lots of leaked trailers have been appearing online. 

WB intially only released the Batman V Superman trailer but tried to keep suicide squad comic-con exlusive for as long as they could but eventually caved in and released it in HD as well. 

I hope Marvel learns from this and realizes that its better to release the trailer officially rather than have people watch it in crappy cam quality since its going to leak anyway especially at d23 where the security isnt as tight as comic-con. 

Studios need to stop with this exclusitivity bullshit. Hopefully Marvel learned from this years comic-con and wont repeat the same mistake as WB.  




 Hmm totalbiscuit is the only good one I know of.  









 don't like up votes? fine i down voted you biatch.  









 ah man I remember those rumors during the days while the dark night was in production and then again when rises was in development. I would still like to see this happen.  









 In the past arrow has usually started filming prior to comic-con this year was different due to Amell finishing up TMNT2. Cause of the late start will there be more breaks once arrow returns so they can catch up?  




 Any James Bond movie.  




 deadpool probably isnt for you then. its a certain type of humor targeted at a certain audience. Ryan Reynolds is portryaing deadpool exactly how he is from the comics. Its perfect.  




 a good fuckin time at the movies 




 You know the one you keep telling your friends and yourself that youll eventually watch but you never do. yea that one.  




 dun dun dun...... 









 this was after 5 weeks of filming. of course its not gonna look that great.  




 So In case you didn't hear AMDs stock is at an all time low. AMD makes the chips inside the PS4,Xbox one and Wii U so It just doesn't affect sony but lets focus on Sony right now. If something happened to AMD what would happen to the ps4? who would manufacture the chips? would sony outsource development to someone else?

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amds-stock-plunges-to-lowest-level-in-more-than-2-12-years-2015-07-07 




 They like to clock a feel.  









 turns you off? what were you turned on by batman v superman? you dirty cheating bastard.  














 i dont really care tbh i just want to play it.  









 Its been a few weeks now, anything? Or a crackers not bothering until the PC version gets fixed? 




 Its sad to think that if Fox and Marvel ever make a deal to share the x-men in the MCU that we wont have Hugh Jackman have a scene with RDJ or Chris Evans or any of the other cast. I dont think anyone can replace him.  









 How will this affect hollywod and femanism? will it cause a negative reation across the board?  




 your thinking of Christopher Lee.  




 OMG! WE KNEW IT! WE FUCKIN KNEW IT! I mean where else were they gonna go for S4? Now I'm curious as to what will bring Oliver out of retirement.  




 There are mixed feelings on it. Some say it got to artsy for its own good and put being artsy over character development and plot but I disagree I think the show has been great you really need to watch it yourself to decide we cant make up your mind for you.  




 Hannibal has been imprisoned for three years at the Baltimore State Hospital when a new villain emerges in one Francis Dolarhyde. Jack reaches out to Will to help him track down the brutal serial killer.

Found this on rottentomatoes. Seems to be legit.  




 actually a lot of people do go for the trailers as dumb as it sounds.  









 Both films had fans wanting sequels but they never happened, why didn't they? 


































 eh I love it when the scene changes to the bigger aspect ratio. it looks amazeballs.  









 interesting my 4790 non k does just fine on the stock cooler. low 30s idle. and around 60-70 while gaming.  




 he obviously installed it wrong. my i7 4790 is on stock cooler im getting 33c right now with just chrome open and I get about 60-70C on load.  




 Probably January 2017. 




 it will still air on BBC one as usual.  




 kickass torrents.  




 Life of Pi 




 And watch as this post gets deleted as well.  














 Its not.  









 They used the LOTR music because at the time the score wasn't even composed yet.  














 why dont you fuck off? eh.  




 is that the one that sounds like a bird? fuck its annoying.  




 did you ever think they might have hearing problems? maybe they need it loud so they can hear it.  




 Maybe they release the first half of the season this year and second half in 2016? 




 Probably in August at D23. Comic-Con is getting a behind the scenes clip or something.  




 or they do a different composer for each movie? 









 From RT" A film remains Certified Fresh unless its Tomatometer falls below 70%. Reserved for the best reviewed films, the Certified Fresh accolade constitutes a seal of approval, synonymous with quality".
 




 I feel like this needs to be said every time a new marvel movie is released. Getting below 70% doesn't mean its a bad movie by any means there are far worse movies out there and besides chances are it could increase to at least over 70% enough to get it certified fresh. Remember the embargo just got lifted so its to early to call the RT number just yet so chill out and go see the movie, enjoy it.  









 Theyll probably do one more to make it an even 6.  




 Is there going to be a main thread to discuss all the comic con movie panels this weekend? 




 na youll get a 680 back lol.  




 If its coming from Variety its pretty much official.  














 BRING ME THE PASSANGERS I WANT THEM ALIVE!  









 Like say at comic con during their panels they just asked the audience straight up what do you guys want in the next avengers movie and actually took down notes and considered them? Or would that movie be a disaster just waiting to happen? 









 Its a prequel.  




 Foggy put on weight.  




 why are you disappointed? the xbox one controller is great for pc games. get off your high horse. stop bitching.  




 My thoughts exactly. If marvel cant get it right. Put the franchise to rest for a while.  




 He starts filming guardians of the galaxy 2 early next year. I'm not sure he has time for anything else. He might be able to squeeze in one more movie before the end of this year if hes willing to work without a break.  




 You might have to go into safe mode and rebuild the database followed by initializing the ps4. https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5044/~/ps4%3A-safe-mode 




 For one the ps4 is pretty slim as it is. What I can see happening instead of a slim model coming out is they keep releasing new hardware revisions sort of like the iphone. We've already seen that with the new CUH-1200 model. With an 18% saving in power consumption, A smaller motherboard and memory modules etc.  Well probably get a "4k" compatible ps4 in the future with a bit more horse power. The only thing I can see going wrong is if they make new games only available only on the newer ps4 models. That would just piss people off.  




 No ones gonna give you hate for liking rise. I love rise also especially the glorious score by hans zimmer.  









 Did you not see the avengers? clearly they do work when done right.  









 I mean what have we had so far? a teaser and like a tv spot or two. I know the movie is still a ways out but this is BOND. its like the UK's biggest franchise you think they'd be marketing the shit out of this.  









 Seems like it would be an obvious thing for Disney to do or will the first trailer be already out by then? I think the first trailer for winter soldier came out in October.  




 Youtube peasant doesn't know who linus is. what is this madness.  




 Break in and put a firepole then leave. I wonder if they'll notice... 




 the Invisible titan z 




 Its a trap. we're all going to see flashing lights now.  









 Its so cute!  




 You didn't even try and google did you? 




 Wtf thats creepy.  









 Sauce? 




 Batman's suit is confirmed to use Kryptonite. Learn to keep up with news.  









 Like how hot can they be for extended periods of time before it starts effecting their life span? 




 That's quite the spoiler there be warned. Your ruining a great surprise.  




 Its not a scam its run by EA. Something must have gone wrong on their end. you should have waited for the key.  




 Find out on the next episode of dragonballz! 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vawwy2eu5sA 




 Anyone else really looking forward to this game?  




 speak for yourself. A lot of us like diablo 3.  




 +1 for Rocket League! looks like a great multiplayer game.  









 cant you get both? sleeping dogs should be pretty cheap now. 









 no ones going to wait 6 months to year to play it on PC. 




 Wow your a douche bag.  




 She was the one who passed on Black Panther. Marvel didn't pass on her.  




 https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/ 




 I get it. it sucks what happened to Victoria but come on. if r/PS4 goes dark what do we do then? 




 I cant take these posts seriously anymore. So cringey.  




 Just an entry level IT service technician job.  




 So I'm a recent graduate student and this is my first time job hunting so maybe I just suck at finding jobs but I'm having trouble finding entry level IT jobs. I've applied to about 12 jobs so far been declined from one. I check trademe and seek a few hours a day. Any other places I can look at and any tips for looking for IT jobs? 









 I think your partly right. I think they will assemble to take out a bigger threat Baron Zemo? But it will be the last time we see Stark and Rogers team up until Infinity War. I think when Stark finds out Bucky killed his parents Stark wont be able to forgive Rogers for keeping that from him. They will put a side their differences in Civil War for the greater good but once the dust settles in Civil War stark and rogers will part ways until Thanos arrives.  




 so what if hes on FB a lot as long as he gets the job done who cares.  









 How many episodes would you want and what news stories would you want to see the show tackle?
