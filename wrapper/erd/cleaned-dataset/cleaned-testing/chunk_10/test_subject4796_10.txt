 Audio seems to be a pretty popular format for books! What made you want to switch? 




 For example, I've gone from preferring to read in silence to enjoying reading the most when I have some background music or noise playing.

 When hot coffee or tea is at the perfect temperature that lets you sip your drink without burning your tongue.

 Do not trust a person who buys unfrosted poptarts. 









 People who blame waiters for bad food. I can understand a situation like a request not being written down, but why blame the waiter if your food doesn't taste good or is undercooked, overcooked, etc.? 




 Girls with boyish haircuts. The last girl I dated had bleach blonde hair cut to angsty-teenage-boy, and goddamn, she made me harder than a tank made of wolverine's bones.
