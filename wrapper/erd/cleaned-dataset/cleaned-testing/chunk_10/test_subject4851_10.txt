 There's nothing about being racist, or prejudiced, or being paid half to do the same work with the same amount of qualifications, in there either. So.... 




 I'm with you on this. We just don't take our little one out until she learned such behavior was unacceptable. She learned fairly quickly.  









 This. When people ask questions regarding moral decline and an increasingly sexualized people. #progress 




 Any Irishman on here? Please read this in said thick accent. 




 Very true. But I think he isn't unique in this.  









 Thanks for the link, I'll take a look.  




 On your last sentence, walk me through your reasoning on that? Why do you think so or not... 




 "assuming life is a one in a trillion". This is the key assumption right? 




 Ah, but within theistic philosophy, you know there are those who subscribe to a hierarchy of 'other' entities (think Greek, Romans and Teutons). 




 lol. That's an interesting thought. So it's not infinite then, you just can't get out of it? check. 




 How is the universe infinite? Can you cite a source I can look at? 




 Guys, i'm neither for or against any side of the argument (at least not within the context of this debate). What I want is your conclusions on the question and the reasoning that led to it.

Thanks to all who have replied. 




 In keeping with objective facts: how is the universe 'infinite'? Where is the proof of this?
 




 So, this Bernie Sanders guy, are we going to vote him in or what? 
What is the plan? What about congress? 

I have nothing against Sanders (i'm actually pretty much sold on him except I will do my homework/research before a final decision), but I am not going to invest my psychic strength in the presidential election just to watch congress get Jerrymandered to death. 

 




 And how is your belief in aliens not the same as those held by many theists? How do you define 'alien' and why do we expect them to be made up of the same substance as our universe (namely, matter)? 




 I see your point. And also appreciate your noting the value in the idea. I think it will only be a matter of time before someone with a more cost effective mechanism figures out an 'affordable' solution. 



















 Please seek professional help. This is no different from suffering major physical trauma. You need professional treatment/therapy to heal properly.  




 Never finding your size in the clearance isle. I mean on stuff you'd actually want to buy. 




 I find it ironic that our greatest device as a species is something designed for mass destruction. Hats off humanity, way to go! 




 If your plan is to 'save' money, then you don't have a plan. Please read and comprehend the ops experience, which is very similar to your proposal. 




 Brilliant. And very wise. 




 You start off by calling my comment retarded, then begin to elaborate on asset allocation. .. Hmm. 




 This is very true. It brings go mind, the advice Christ gave to the one rich fellow: part with your riches. Most people think this was meant for everyone. But it is only meant for a very specific type of person who, as you alluded to, the wealth would effectively paralyze rather than help.

Some people will use the wealth in a productive, furthering way. For others, it will rob them of the fire to be successful and do something with their lives. 




 Hear, hear! 




 "Sanders would ruin the country"... Something there doesn't sound right. Isn't it already in ruins when minimum wage is unable to ... Nah, never mind. It's Friday and the weather is beautiful. I'm not going to let anyone take that away from me! You hear me? You selfish greedy ones, you are not going to take that away from me! 




 You are either making money, or spending it. Nothing stands still...
You will only end up flat broke when you fail to plan.  




 I think this advice, while well intended, is the wrong one. Money is as water, it is designed to move and not stay put. It is just in trying to 'put away' money (ie. holding water in your hands) that it will slowly trickle away and eventually flow elsewhere completely.
Dream a dream and go after it. There is nothing more potent than having a goal of what to do with the money. The absence of this is the presence of exactly what the author enumerated.
 




 How much time have you dedicated outside your own mind and thinking on the matter? 
Maybe you can start here and look for some of the publications referenced in the video.

 TL;DR: What we have is a modern-day case of the emperors new clothes. So many compromises to the truth have been made and careers advanced by hiding or glossing over gender-integration issues in the military. It will take concerted opposition from a range of politicians who have the courage to look beyond the latest headline in the New York Times or on CNN.

 What's a terrible idea? 




 Isn't this a little too convenient? Doesn't it give freedom to so many things that are logically objectionable? 

One person may enjoy dog fights, another the torturing animals or other human beings. Yet others rape, murder, etc.

No, enjoyment shouldn't even be a factor.

 









 I'm sorry that I don't think, and you probably agree, that just because x number of people 'enjoy' something and find it 'entertaining' is any measure of it not being a waste of time and energy.
The right question to ask is: to what end? What, of value, comes out of this adventure? 




 What do you do? No seriously? 




 Let me ask you then to give me an example, just one, of something that you consider 'deep'?  




 I wouldn't have to. Since we are doing the same thing, we will logically end with the same results.  




 Let's be realistic, no one is going to convince anyone of anything they weren't already inclined to believe. My comment was actually meant more for people like yourself... People who actually pause to think.
And no, i do not have any constructive alternatives since I am just as lost as everyone else. But in pointing out this fact, maybe more people will realize, then we can all gather and figure out what to do instead.
