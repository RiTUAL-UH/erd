 The theatrical cut, the director's cut, the final cut, the workprint, and the broadcast version. 




 Sure, but I think we can tell empirically now that whenever Clemson is projected to win the ACC, Florida State will go on to win the national championship.   




 ESPN has ranked the SEC teams with the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 18th, 19th, and 20th hardest SOS. 

It might already be mathematically impossible for less than 6 SEC teams to be in the top 15 at any given time.  




 You could also look at it as one missed catch (NCState) and one bad quarter of play by EJ Manuel (UF) away from being 13-0 going into bowl season. We had one of the five best defenses in the nation and one of the 10-15 best offenses. Also we finished 8th in the final coaches poll. We were definitely in that range.  




 Last time Clemson was predicted to win the ACC? 2013. 




 Probably not though. Assuming that 8-4 means splitting Notre Dame and South Carolina, it puts you at 5-3 in conference play. It's very likely that at least one of FSU   Louisville go 6-2 or better in conference. I think 9-3 is the low end of the Atlantic champion, but 10-2 is most likely. 




 I'm going to disagree with you on Jimbo - if he leaves it would be for the NFL I imagine, so he certainly *could* do a Saban, but it's far more likely he just stays at FSU permanently. 




 - Both had two national championships    
- T-5 ranked seasons: Bowden 15, Paterno 13  
- T-10 ranked seasons: Bowden 18, Paterno 20  
- Ranked Seasons: Bowden 28, Paterno 35
- Total Wins: Bowden 389, Paterno 409


I'm ignoring conference titles because Joe Pa's "prime" was mostly while they were still an independent school  
 




 Green. Very green. 




 Can I come with? This was not the wild ride I signed up for.  




 You spelled his name wrong.  




 We'd be lucky to finish the season in the T10, because right now we're just not a T10 team. But lucky to be ranked is ridiculous. Everett Golson is plenty good enough to man the helm for a ranked team, we have the 2nd best RB in the ACC and THREE five star WR's. We also return 7 starters on defense.   
Beyond that, our schedule is extremely weak this year. USF/Texas State/Wake/Syracuse/Chattanooga are five wins on lock. We'll be heavily favored over @BC, Miami, and NC State. So even if we only win one of @GT, @Clemson and @UF there's still a good chance this team goes 10-2.  




 Disagree, Christian Ponder's junior year was much better than any year EJ Manuel had and he was looking like a very real NFL prospect on talent alone before he got injured and lost a lot of shoulder strength.  




 There isn't, dude mispoke.  




 I think Auburn is going to get the disappointment train rolling early and lose to Louisville 




 It's actually a good bit less than that because any time he plays another texas team he's earning non-state taxed income, and anytime he plays in Tennessee or Florida (@Heat, @Memphis or @Magic) he's earning income that doesn't give rise to a state income tax.

Also state income taxes are deductible on his fed return so 40% of the amount he pays in state income taxes is going right back into his pocket as a federal deduction.

Also taking into account agent fees and other deductible expenses his actual taxable income is going to be much lower than that anyways.

 Thank goodness SheridanHoops has probably the least reputable of any major twitter leak guy.  




 Johnson is our only returning starter. Cameron irving was our starting center, because four games into the season Hoefield was getting so dominated at the line that he lost his starting job; so technically we're returning his starts but it's worthless as he is likely not going to get his starting job back again this year. Tre Jackson, Bobby Hart and Josue Matias were all drafted as well. 
As far as the rest of our O-line goes, we had two JUCO tranfers that redshirted last year but have supposedly looked very good in the spring game (Chad Mavety and Kareem Are), then redshirt sophomore Wilson Bell will take right guard, leaving us with only the center position to fill. We've got talent and our O-line should theoretically not look terrible, but we're extremely green with four players having no starts to their name. 




 We lost a few important players (Jernigan, Joyner), but we returned 17 starters, 4/5 of our O-line, a Heisman QB, two projected draftee receivers, the best kicker in the nation, three projected 1st or 2nd round picks in the secondary, and two more projected first-third round picks on our D-Line. it was definitely one of the most stacked talentwise teams of the last couple of years, so... no tOSU isn't returning more talent than we did.  




 No, we lost four starters and have the 2nd fewest returning starts of any O-line in the country. 




 Yep. Last year they went 6-3 before FSU and 0-3 afterwords.

in 2013 they went 7-0 before FSU and 2-2 afterwords.

 




 Ehh, it's also unfair to equivocate all top programs though.

For all it's problems, FSU forcing players out is not one of them, Alabama and Ohio State have had 16 and 14 more players sign with them over the last four years respectively, because Jimbo just doesn't really employ that tactic.  




 TBF this pretty much described FSU to a tee last year. 

Having every team gunning for your back, and dealing with injuries/regression/new coordinators really does make repeating extraordinarily hard.  




 Davis' offense was considered extremely raw in college and was the biggest question mark he had going into the draft.  




 Nah. Kevin Love got the Wolves Wiggins with one year left on his contract. Magic got Vuc, Aflallo, and the #12 pick. Deron Williams got the Jazz #3 pick Derrick Favors and  another #3 pick after that. There's still plenty of value with 1 year left.  




 Also the summer after that. 




 Because it probably wasn't rigged  




 Yeeeah, this would be a legal breach of contract with a remedy in a federal court, lol they wouldn't have to strike to enforce their own CBA. 




 Oladipo would be our starting SG, like he was last year.  




 This is wrong. Moses did it in 1983.

http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198305290LAL.html

Cowens did it 3 times in the same finals series: http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/cowenda01/gamelog/1974/


 




 He's class of 2017 though, so probably 3 years minimum away from making a contribution. Still a nice grab nonetheless.

 If you go back in time to 7 minutes left in the third quarter and replay that game without any of FSU's ridiculous turnovers, my guess is FSU would have like a 25% chance of winning that game.

Of course, based on the reports about how Oregon was looking to strip the ball because they noticed FSU players carried it loose, I'm thinking you just chalk that TO margin to random chance, so the answer is "very likely not" 









 No, because no team would ever play their two best players 24 minutes or less.  




 58-11 in 5 years as head coach, 39-3 last three seasons, 27-1 last two seasons, one year removed from national championship, two major bowl wins, 4 T5 recruiting classes the last five years? 17th sounds about right.  









 *cough*Magic*cough* 




 Would it? They had Kevin Love those 41 games.  




 It's another way of saying "the 12 highest regular season teams of all time by MOV", of which the Warriors are comfortably in that pack.  




 Nope, Thunder were the highest team to miss the cutoff (9.21) 




 12 Teams in NBA history have eclipsed a regular season point differential of 9.24

-Ten of them have won the NBA championship.   
-One of them (Kareem's 1972 Bucks, 4th all time in regular season point differential) lost to another team on the list (Lakers, 1st all time in regular season point differential).   
-The other is this year's Golden State Warriors (8th all-time in regular season)

 




 58-11 in 5 years as head coach, 39-3 last three seasons, 27-1 last two seasons, one year removed from national championship, two major bowl wins, 4 T5 recruiting classes the last five years? Yep, 19th sounds about right.  




 Dude, you finished the regular season 6-6 this past year, and that was your first non-losing regular season this decade. You haven't had an 8 win season since 2007, and have gone 40-47 over that timespan. And assessing yourself as #35 is totally asinine considering you weren't even one of the 13 schools receiving votes in the AP poll at the end of the year.  

It's really unfair to expect anyone to believe Tennessee is "back" in any form until you actually get wins on the field.  




 I'm looking to get a good used first motorcycle that is pretty functional/easy to use around the city; but I plan on taking it on 150-300 rides maybe 2-3 times a month, and would eventually like to take it on a couple 400+ mile multi-day journeys. 

I've heard a lot of great things about the Kawasaki KLR 650, and I'm wondering if there were any other bikes that were recommended for the occasional long trip.  




 I'm looking to buy my first motorcycle jacket (and my first motorcycle soon), and one thing I've noticed about jackets is that they end right at the waistline. I'm 6'2 with the torso of somebody who is about 6'4, and skinny enough that most standard "large" sizes are going to fit ridiculously on me. I'm wondering if there are any jackets out there that have naturally longer torsos (or options for longer torsos) so at the very least it hits my belt standing upright. 




 1. You're dramatically underrating our quarterbacks. Who cares what Maguire ran in HS? That was four years ago, and he's had four years to learn Jimbo's *incredibly* complex offense since then.  
2. You act like Maguire played like a scrub against Clemson. He had a bad interception sure, but he also looked incredibly poised at times in the third quarter, and it was against the #1 defense in the nation, and he had not taken ANY snaps with the 1st team up to that point because Winston's suspension was announced the day before the game. Context is incredibly important with that one performance. 
3.  Seriously though, Jimbo's offense is an incredibly complex pro style offense, and it has taken more talented QB's than Golston several years to pick it up. Even if he is (and he might be) a better quarterback in a vacuum than everyone we have on our roster, that doesn't mean he's going to play better than guys like Maguire who have had tons of time to get comfortable with the route trees and the recievers.  
4.  Our Next big recruit, Malik Henry, is about to be a senior in HS and there is very little chance he starts as a true freshman for the aforementioned reasons. We need a starting QB for the next two years, and none of the current QB's on our roster are seniors. So even if Golson did turn out to be the best option, unless he is dramatically better I don't think it's wise for our long-term development as a team looking at 2016 to start a guy with one year of eligibility left.

So, stop acting so indignant about FSU fans throwing away some gift from heaven bestowed upon them. There are plenty of reasons for FSU fans to be wary of this transfer.  




 Yikes... Talking about modern era coaches (i.e. since inception of AP poll in 1936) I would put it in a rough order of something like this, with the top four all definitely in the top 5.  

Bear Bryant  
Joe Pa  
Bobby Bowden  
Tom Osborne  
Woody Hayes   
Barry Switzer  
Nick Saban  
Bud Wilkinson  
Darrell Royal  
Frank Leahy  
Urban Meyer  
John McCay  
Ara Parseghian   

I think you could argue for Hayes/Switzer in the five spot right now, with Saban easily beating out those two if he continues to finish in the top-10 for a couple more years and/or wins another chip. 




 In coaching history haha. I definitely would say BB is T-5 all-time. 




 Very likely never. Sorry. Five championships is pretty ridiculous.  




 The all-time numbers are not incorrect, they add back wins vacated by the NCAA. 




 Incredibly well for freshman, which is almost impossible to do given how complex Jimbo's route trees are. WR's simply do not thrive as freshman here.  




 I mean, you could also say that their record is meaningless considering they played different schedules every year too. They're still valid accomplishments that go on a school's resume. 




 Nah, we have the #2 receiver from this past years class, and the #3 and #5 WR from the 2014 class who both played incredibly well as freshman.

**Why They're the Bes**t:  

**Florida**: Will always be "the" program in the state of Florida. Bigger boosters, more resources,  more fans, SEC affiliation. If a coach had his pick of the three programs, it would just about always be UF, as they're simply the more prestigious job. 

**Florida State**: FSU has one of the 5ish "Titans" of coaching in college football history. They're 3 more made bowls away from breaking Nebraska's record for consecutive bowl appearances (currently at 33, the record is 35). From 1987-2000 they finished the season ranked in the top-5 FOURTEEN consecutive times, no other school in history has ever done it more than seven. In fact, in the last 30 years no school has won more games than Florida State's 300, with Nebraska (289) in 2nd and tOSU (286) in 3rd. 

**Miami**: You like Natty's? Every other accomplishment in college football is varying degrees of "nice" but championships are the goal, and Miami has five of them. Only Alabama has more in the last 50 years.  




 That's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you! 




 I've started saving with the intermediate-term goal of buying an apartment or flat in my city. I believe I can find one I will like for about $120,000. I'm trying to figure out how much I need in total to actually buy the apartment including *all* costs of acquiring the property. I know saving up 20% to avoid PMI is smart. Otherwise I have no idea what the other miscellaneous costs will be. 




 Probably fair to point out that with vacated wins added back it's:  
1. Nebraska 389   
2. Ohio State 378  
3. Florida State 377  
4. Oklahoma 365  




 Orange bowl is actually one of the semi-finals this year, but a major bowl for sure. 




 **Clemson v. FSU**. It would be easy to say that Clemson would run away with this, as they did afterall only lose to FSU last time with their (now Heisman winning) starting quarterback out of commission. The game starts, and Clemson takes off, moving the ball around the field at will. An early interception by Francois turns into a short touchdown drive for Clemson, and they are starting to pull away heavy at the end of the first half 35-14. The second half begins, and Kermit Whitfield works his National Championship magic, returning the ball for a touchdown. 35-21. Clemson starts to look a little stifled, and FSU proves capable of burning the clock on the run, though a costly lost fumble prevents them from making up any ground for the rest of the third quarter. Clemson starts the 4th quarter with a field goal. To begin to pull away again 38-21. FSU responds quickly with a downfield 50 yarder to Rudolph putting them immediately in scoring position again. Another completed pass over the middle to Rudolph, and Jacques Patrick there to punch it in from the 3 yard line, FSU scores 38-28. Clemson gets the ball back, and Watson is sacked for a loss. Next play, quick screen to Germone Hopper, but the pass is low and it bounces off his arms directly into the hands of Jalen Ramsey. FSU Ball. At the 15. Two run plays later its 3rd and 1 at the 6. Cook runs it in for the TD. 38-35 Clemson still leading. Clemson gets the ball back again, 3:17 left on the clock. Incomplete pass. Incomplete pass. Third and 10 and FSU is out of timeouts. Watson throws to Scott for 8 yards. Swinney plays conservative and punts it. This proves to be a bad idea, as Bobo Wilson takes it back 20+ yards to the Clemson 23 yard line. Two minute warning. Francois pass incomplete to Rudolph, almost picked off. Clemson brings the Blitz on 2nd and Francois dumps it off to Cook for a gain of five. Third down Cook goes right up the middle. To get the first at the 11 yard line. 35 seconds left. Francois lobs it to Ermon Lane in the corner. Touchdown FSU 42-38. Clemson kick return gets them out to the 45 yard line, but Watsons Hail Mary bounces off a group of defenders and wide receivers bunched together as time expires. And thats how FSU beats Clemson to win the National Championship.  




 The 2015 season starts off with a bang. The nation forgets that Bobby Petrino is a really good coach, and receiving votes Louisville upsets #10 Auburn vaulting them to about 15th (and Auburn to 17th), many pollsters think the surprisingly potent offense makes them the favorite to win the ACC after their close win over an elite SEC team, but the momentum doesnt last long. Clemson dominated two cupcakes early, but nobody really knows anything about their team yet, except that Deshaun Watson is healthy. Clemson goes into Louisville at home and puts on a remarkable display of offensive firepower, winning 45-24. This includes a 330yard/3td/80 rushing yd game by Deshaun Watson who is now front and center of the Heisman race. Two and a half weeks later they trample a #16 ranked Notre Dame team that was considered formidable with a solid win over Texas and a close loss to Georgia Tech. Another 350yd/2td performance by Deshaun who is leading the nation in passer rating, and Clemson has climbed comfortably into 9th place looking very much like a playoff contender four games into the season. 

On the other side of the ACC, Georgia Tech looks like a fully realized triple option team. Justin Thomas has the engine humming smoothly and so far theyve beaten two cupcake teams, eeked out a close win against formerly #12 Notre Dame thanks to a 4th quarter interception, and mauled Duke and UNC for 380+ rushing yards a piece. 

When Georgia Tech and Clemson meet, a large minority of media personalities think this could a preview of the ACC championship, and maybe even a playoff spot preview, with the two teams already a combined 9-0 and ranked in the top 12. The teams start off trading blows  touchdown after touchdown  each quarterback looking unstoppable in their respective system. Thanks to some great halftime adjustments by Venables, they manage to hold GT scoreless for three consecutive possessions in the 3rd/4th quarter which is enough to pull away for a 38-31 win.  Clemson now has three wins against ranked teams 5 games into the season. They cruise through a couple lesser opponents, Boston College and Miami, climb up to #6 in the polls at 7-0, and are feeling on top of the world before traveling to NC State for a heartbreakingly pyrrhic 42-10 victory. But first rewind a bit. 

Florida state starts the reason ranked 8th, and nobody is exactly sure why. Five of their six best players left early for the draft or graduated, their offensive line has a total of EIGHT career starts between all five of them, and true freshman Deandre Francois was named the starter 10 days before their opener, much to the surprise of the entire fan base. They start the season creaming two fluff teams, and leave their fans with cautious optimism after a 34-21 win over Boston College. After two big wins over two more easy conference rivals Wake Forest and a decrepit Miami (Kaaya ends the day with four interceptions) a couple things become clear: FSU has an *elite* trio of running backs carrying the team, Francois is not a game manager but a gunslinger who is being consistently bailed for his rookie mistakes by an elite receiving corps of Rudolph/Lane/Wilson/Harrison/Campbell, and their secondary might also be one of the best in the nation. Of course, the narrative is not a pretty one, with the vast majority of CFB fans assuming they are way overrated and havent played anybody and living on reputation alone. Even when #7 Florida State (they moved up one spot thanks to USC falling flat on its ass) beats #17 Louisville 35-24 to go 6-0 they are given no love, as Louisville is now viewed as a pretender with a fluke win over Auburn.   

Georgia Tech, now two weeks removed from their loss to Clemson and hungry for blood, frustrates their way to a 35-34 home victory over Florida State, with an 80 yard drive (capped off by a 20 yard TD pass from Thomas) in the final four minutes of the game. FSU drops to #13 and hope looks to be lost for the season. 

Clemson goes into NC State and absolutely dominates, but late in the 3rd quarter on a fateful 3rd and short, Watson escapes out of a collapsing pocket to run for the first down, and doesnt get back up. He is pulled from the game while the collective Clemson fan base holds their breath for the news. The next day it is announced Watson has sprained his ankle and will be out for three weeks. 

12th ranked Florida State goes into #3 Clemsons Memorial Stadium and Deandre Francois has the game of his life. With two 60+ yard bombs down the field, and the running back trio averaging 6.6ypc, Clemson simply doesnt have the offense without Deshaun Watson on the field, and the Tigers fall 41-31 to the Noles. In spite of this, the CFB playoff committee controversially ranks Clemson #8 and FSU #9, citing their starting quarterbacks absence as a mitigating factor. But the travesty sets in for Clemson fans, knowing that both schools now have one conference game loss and Florida State holds the tiebreaker. With an easy win over NC State, FSU Miraculously locks in its 4th ACC title game in a row. Georgia Tech finishes the season with a second very close win against Virginia Tech and a trampling of Miami to go 10-1. 

Over in the SEC, there has been a dramatic shift of power. Floridas line looks atrocious at first but comes together against their first real test, at Missouri. Will Grier is thriving in McElwains offensive scheme and is getting Heisman murmurs from their fanbase. After he leads the gators in a march down the field for two fourth quarter scores and pull out a 28-24 victory over LSU, ESPN adopts the nickname for him big game Grier. In a 2014 Noles fashion they pull out close wins over Missouri, Tennessee at home, at LSU and against Georgia. They were briefly ranked #2 going 9-0 before the Ole ball coach gives them their first loss of the season. South Carolina, by the way, has rebounded miraculously from last season, and from an early loss the Georgia, sweeping through A M, LSU, and the rest of its conference schedule. With a win over the Gators and their pre-Clemson cupcake, the Gamecocks are also 10-1. Georgia proves to the nation just how good a team can be behind their running back, as Nick Chubb has been front and center in the Heisman race all year with an insane 1800 yards through 11 games, and the only loss on the Bulldogs schedule against UF. On the other side of the conference, cannibalism abound in Alabamas down year, as Auburn, Bama, and LSU all finish 9-3, capped off with an exciting Auburn win over Bama in the Iron bowl. Ole Miss, A M, and Arkansas all finish 8-4 or 7-5, and Miss St. tumbles back down to earth with a 6-6 season.

November 28th. The stage is set. #3 Florida v. #8 FSU, #4 Georgia v. #7 Georgia Tech., #5 South Carolina v. #6 Clemson, all six teams 10-1, all six teams still very much in the hunt for a playoff bid. Some consider it to be the greatest ACC/SEC rivalry weekend ever. At noon, Georgia Tech looks absolutely unstoppable. Brice Ramsay has a miserable day throwing for 3 interceptions and the yellow jackets win 34-17. Mark Richt quietly cusses under his breathing, having finally lost control. At 3:30, a now healthy Deshaun Watson in his first game back goes off the rails against SC, with 400 yards and four touchdowns in a desperate plea to the committee that Clemson does in fact deserve to be in the playoffs. Clemson wins 45-27. Florida v. Florida State: this game was ugly, with four turnovers by FSU and 2 by the gators in the first three quarters. A touchdown throw by Francois (3 ints so far) is immediately responded to by a touchdown from Grier to put them up 21-20. With 48 seconds left of the clock the Noles return the ball to the 35, then Mario Pender catches a short pass and breaks two tackles to get the noles to the Gators 41 yard line. Three seconds left, 55 yards, Aguayo nails it, Noles win. 

Louisville beats Kentucky, by the way, to go 10-2, and for the second consecutive year the ACC goes 4-0 against its rivals. The SEC east has a 2008 Big-12 problem, with all three SEC East teams sharing one division loss, and one OOC loss. In another controversial move  the SEC uses the CFB rankings, where Georgia is ranked in front of Florida, to decide the tiebreaker for the SEC championship game, as opposed to the AP (and every other poll) where Florida is ranked higher.

Quickly, around the rest of the nation, TCU looks to be unstoppable through 10 games before consecutive losses to end the season at Oklahoma and at Baylor putting them 10-2. Baylor loses at Kansas State, but the win over TCU puts them right back in the playoff spotlight at 10-1, before crumbling at home to Texas 28-7. Ohio State turns out to be a huge disappointment, going from no regular season conference losses ever under Meyer to 3 dropping Penn State, Michigan State, AND Michigan. Michigan by the way finishes 9-3, while Harbaughs eccentric personality is GIFd relentlessly throughout the season. By the end of the year, Michigan State as it turns out is THE team to beat in 2015. Wins over Oregon at home, at Michigan, at Nebraska, at OSU, and at Penn State round out an incredible perfect regular season for the Spartans. An easy 31-10 win over Nebraska in the B1G championship secures their playoff spot. 

In the PAC12, Oregon loses early to Michigan State putting a damper on their season early, subsequent losses to ASU and Stanford put their season to rest. USC collapses early and fast with losses to Stanford, Arizona State, and Notre Dame. ASU actually starts off very hot with a win over A M, USC, and Oregon later in the season, and even looked like playoff contenders despite the loss to UCLA, but the home loss of Arizona late in November and the PAC12 title loss to Stanford knocks them out for good. Stanford, actually, becomes the national team to beat #2. Winning at USC, against Arizona, against UCLA, and against Oregon makes them a spotlight championship contender. Most of the west coast feels theyre better than Michigan State because of their harder SoS, and they do move briefly to #1 in the AP polls after their win against Oregon. Their regular season ends on a down note with a loss to Notre Dame, but going 12-1 and winning the PAC12 is enough to also secure them a spot in the playoffs uncontroversially.

With two de facto playoff spots in the bag, the race has come down to a de ja vu standoff of Baylor/TCU, now each with two losses, three two loss SEC teams (but with only Georgia viewed as having a real shot, as they are in the SEC championship game), and three one loss ACC teams. The SEC question is answered quickly as LSU turns into a defensive hammer against Georgia, winning 17-10 and then SEC championship as a 10-3 team. In the ACC playoffs the #5 Noles, now more comfortable playing against the triple option a second time this season, hit hard against #4 GT defensively and control the game for the entire second half, avenging their regular season loss. 

The final playoff standings end much more controversially than the previous year. #1 Michigan State is easy, so is #2 Stanford. Despite four wins against teams ranked in the top-15, there is still a large contingent of people furious about FSU being ranked #3 because hurr durr ACC and look what happened last time we let them in. Its the number four spot though  11-1 Clemson over #5 Baylor and #6 TCU that has the entire big 12 in an uproar. Despite wins over #23 Pittsburgh, #15 Louisville, #11 Notre Dame,  #10 South Carolina, #8 Georgia Tech, and their only loss to #3 Florida State WITH their Heisman candidate quarterback injured, the Big12 commissioner issues a statement of reproach against the playoff committee for discrimination for not having a championship game. 

So here we are with the field set. Michigan State goes to the Cotton bowl to play Clemson. Although the Spartans defense has been very good without Narduzzi, they clearly miss him this game. Connor Cook is expected to go in the top 5 in this years draft, and he shows why  cutting up the Clemson secondary all game long. Michigan State gets the lead early, but a third quarter fumble and a couple of key stops in the run game are the difference for Clemson; Gallman/Williams/Scott/Watson have an absolute field day  scoring in their first five possessions of the second half to pull away and pull the upset 49-41. 

Stanford and FSU are giving each other fits  with both Ryan Burns and Francois throwing two interceptions in the first half. Both teams begin to retreat to their more depending run game in the second half; with FSU finding success behind Pender/Cooks speed outside the edges, and the Stanford power run game completely overpowering FSUs Dline. With 2 minutes left in the 4th, Stanford is at their own 16 yard line and is looking to drive into field goal position. Burns looks for a throw over the middle to pick up the first down  but doesnt see Jalen Ramsey, blowing by the tight end blocking on the weakside, hurls himself right into the Burns back. The ball comes out, Jacob Pugh is there to scoop it up. FSU ball. FSU burns the clock down, kicks the easy field goal, and prevents any last minute heroics to beat Stanford 30-27. 




 




 Dividing by 0 doesn't work that way. 




 For one stretch during the game? Absolutely. 




 deprecating* 




 You mean all-time great with the Magic? He signed with Orlando before getting injured. 




 He has plenty of football smarts, just no shoulder strength whatsoever due to multiple surgeries. 




 Still 2 points worse than Christian Ponder!

 I'd be willing to give Vuc, Harris, AND our first rounder this year, and two of our stockpile of second rounders, in exchange for Boogie. Based on how much teams have gotten for disgruntled past stars, I think both teams come out way ahead off of that.  




 Yep. That just happened :( 




 Well, Olympics don't factor into your ranking as an all-time NBA player. There are tons of players who have made 5 all-star teams that aren't in the pyramid, but I do think being the 2nd best player on 2 championship teams might tip the scale in his favor... but I do think it's close. 




 Shoot... forgot to put him on the Players already on the list list. Updating now, thanks. 




 Well, Steve Nash didn't make an all-star team until he was 27. Some players bloom later than others. 




 NP man, I do it all the time. 




 Yes, I'm actually positive he was an all-star.  




 "In or past" 




 I'd like to think in this hypothetical the pyramid expands, and the cutoff isn't top-96 but some arbitrary level of career accomplishment that defines you as an "all timer" or something like that. 




 Roy Hibbert has made the all-star team twice. 




 Lol, woops, fixing that now. 




 Well, the Pacer's playoff success probably has a lot to do with the rest of the team (Hibbert, Hill, West, Stephenson, coaching) being better than anything Love/Wall has had up to this season. But the general consensus of Love and Wall being in the upper echelon of NBA players has been happening a lot longer than for PG. 




 If it matters, I think Wall is probably the lowest on his tier, and Kyrie is probably the highest on the tier below. I see them both as having comparable (in greatness, not in play style) careers but wall being a year ahead and generally having less injury issues gives him the nudge up for me.  




 Well, Paul Pierce is already number 47, so there's that. 




 The Former. 




 Paul George has only had two seasons at a very good/elite level; Wall and Love have both been there for a while longer.

Edit: to respond to your edit, Love has put up better statistical seasons than Bosh ever did in Toronto, Love has only missed the playoffs because it's significantly harder to make the playoffs in the west during Love's tenure in Minnesota with incompetently managed/coached teams. We actually don't know if Love will serve as a better 3rd man than Bosh, because this is only his first year with the Cavs and he's only 26 years old. Bosh's career has pretty much finished being defined at this point, but Love still has at least 5 years of very high quality play left, so it's more of an open question. 




 I'm sure most of you are familiar with The Big Book of Basketball, and the second half which is dedicated entirely to [The Pyramid](http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/simmons_pyramid.html), the ranking of the 96 greatest players in NBA history. I'm curious, now that it's been about five years since the last edition of the list was compiled, who do you think has marked a place on the list? Right now we have:

**Active Players already on the list**  
Chris Paul  
Dwight Howard  
Paul Pierce  
Dirk  
Duncan   
Kobe   
Lebron  
KG  
Wade

**Players who have definitely made the list already**  
Kevin Durant  
Carmelo Anthony  

**Soon will, as long as their career doesn't end today**  
Russell Westbrook  
Stephen Curry  
James Harden  

**Too soon to say, but it's likely they will**   
Anthony Davis  
Kevin Love  
Demarcus Cousins  
Blake Griffin  
John Wall  

**Too soon to say if they're on that trajectory yet**  
Paul George  
Kawhi Leonard  
Kyrie Irving  
Andre Drummond  
Jimmy Butler  
Damian Lillard  

**In or past their prime, with a borderline/outside shot of making it on**  
Lamarcus Aldridge   
Pau Gasol  
Marc Gasol  
Al Horford  
Amare Stoudamire  
Chris Bosh  
Zach Randolph  
Derrick Rose*  
Tony Parker  
Manu  

I'm excluding players in their first two years, because anyone who says anything about Gobert, Giannis, Dipo, Noel, Wiggins, Parker et. al. is just wild speculation at this point.

*I realize how controversial it is to leave an MVP off the list, but given the historical backlash of saying he didn't deserve it, and assuming his career of playing at an elite level is over by now, I really don't think Rose will be looked back on much better than Penny Hardaway or Brandon Roy. 




 I think one thing that's going to benefit us a ton next year is that our schedule starts of with just about all of our easy games. Depending on how you feel about Boston College, we don't have our first real test until like game #5, and our two hardest games are #7 and #9. This should give us a lot of time to find our identity with both the O-line and the D-line. Additionally, all those not-our-toughest-challenges-but-could-ruin-our-season-with-a-loss mid-tier opponents of Louisville, Miami, and NCState are all at Doak. 

Those two factors combined, I actually think we *could* have a pretty low ceiling (hardest games are all away) but a pretty low floor (the must-wins are all at home). 

The offsetting piece is that we don't have a goddamned clue what a single position on either side of the ball will look like, except for at RB.... So who knows.  




 As a Magic fan, I'm actually very invested in you guys getting the Lakers pick, because the Lakers owe Orlando their first round pick 2 years after they convey their first to Philly, so if they give you yours next year we don't get ours until 2018. And I don't think the lakers are going to be that bad that long.  




 Well, worse case you actually finish below 5th... which there's a 17.2% chance of happening. 




 Well, I basically said that at the end... 




 1. Their own pick

2. LA Lakers first round pick, currently protected 1-5 for 2015. Assuming the Lakers finish the season in the 4th-to-last spot, there is a 17.2% chance that they will fall outside the top 5 and the pick will be sent to Philly this year.

3. Miami's first round pick, protected 1-10. This one is interesting, because if Miami sneaks into the playoffs it will drop to 15th, and they're currently .5 games out of the playoffs. But if either Indiana or Charlotte end up passing them, they'll be in the 10th spot in the lottery pick, and will only have a 9.1% of falling outside the top 10 in the draft. Right now Indiana and Charlotte are only .5 and 1.5 games behind them respectively. Philly is walking a pretty tight rope with this one.

4. Oklahoma City, currently protected 1-18. Right now in order to fall outside the top 18, the Thunder would have to pass both the Pelicans and the Wizards. They are currently 2.5 games behind the Wizards with about 5 games left to play. 


It's interesting to me how the most likely scenario here is that they don't get any of the protected draft picks and end up with only 1 in 2015, but there is an incredibly small possibility that they could end up drafting #1, 6, 11, and 19 this year if some games and ping pong balls break their way.  




 Even ignoring the NFL aspect, the fact that we won every regular season game by 14 points or more, and 13 of them by 27 points or more, is pretty unprecedented. So is having the #1 offense AND number #1 defense in the nation in the same year.

 For Orlando fans, it's more just a tired joke. They've been making that Joke since late '12 when Vuc started putting up big numbers. 




 I have *never* seen a ranking of all time greats putting Kareem behind Bird, Kobe, or Shaq, so I'm not sure what you're talking about. 




 Marcus Smart above Elfrid Payton is terrible.
 




 He doesn't have the minutes to be ROY. People are right in leaving him out.  




 Well if you'd like to multiply the probability of each win given certain prior events occurring by the probability of those prior events occurring then be my guest haha, but that's going to get a bit complex for a reddit post. I think this isn't a terrible way to look at your expectations for the season for how simple an exercise it is though. 




 1 Texas State     
1 USF  
.7 Boston College  
.95 @Wake Forest  
.7 Miami  
.7 Louisville  
.5 @Georgia Tech  
.9 Syracuse   
.5 @Clemson  
.75 NC State  
1 Chattanooga  
.5 @UF  

**Projected Total Wins = 9.3** 




 Look at your 12 Games for the upcoming season. Make a wild guess as to the probability of winning each game, represented as a decimal where "1" is a 100% chance of winning. Add the totals together. This is your expected win total or the 2015 season. 




 Florida State! Nobody has any goddamn clue what our team is going to look like or how good we're going to be so it will just be one season long wild ride.

Talent pulls through, defense improves in the 2nd year of our new system, WR's step up, and Maguire turns out to be really good? We could go 12-1 and be ACC champions!

Inexperience, injuries, and lack of LB depth kills us on defense, Charles Kelly prove to be inept at defensive coordinator, new O-line experiences significant growing pains, and Maguire isn't the answer at QB? We could be 7-5 at the end of the year.

Nobody knows anything and everything is a mystery.  




 1. V02 max is, in short, a measurement of your body's maximum  ability to consume oxygen for the purpose of burning glucose as energy. Thus the more oxygen you can use the more energy you will have available for primarily aerobic exercises like running, biking, rowing, etc. 
2. V02 max actually has only a very rough correlation with performance in endurance sports, and there are *tons* of other factors that go into making an athlete great, especially in "skilled" sports like the NHL and NFL. Additionally, V02 max does not always or often with increased cardiovascular fitness, despite what a lot of misinformed articles will have you believe. It's not something that you will progressively improve with time like a lift#. Here's a good excerpt of an article I was reading recently:  

 In addition to lactate differences, other factors such as the individuals substrate use, fiber type, and other physiological variables will all vary considerably at a fixed percent of VO2max. This was demonstrated in a recent study by Vollaard et al. (2009). The study showed that while on average improvements were seen in a variety of endurance parameters after six weeks of endurance training, the individuality of the response was widespread with some showing even negative responses to the training, even though the training was at the same 70%VO2max intensity for all subjects (Vollaard et al., 2009). The study showed that there was a wide range of adaptation in maximal and submaximal tests including VO2 parameters, muscle enzyme activity, and metabolite levels. An interesting finding in the study is that low responders for an increased VO2max were not low responders in other parameters. The change in VO2max did not correlate with the change in performance on a time trial, which is a significant finding demonstrating that perhaps more attention should be paid to changing in performance instead of manipulating physiological parameters such as VO2max. One has to question the training recommendations based on training designed at improving parameters such as VO2max, with the assumption being that performance will improve because of it, when studies show that change in VO2max are often not linked with a change in performance. This phenomenon of varied response is not new and can be seen in a wide array of training situations, such as altitude training for example (Chapman et al., 1998).  

The tl;dr is that for improvement in endurance training, V02 max is just one of a whole bunch of different variables.
 




 I feel like you don't get it though. 

oversimplifying running to what essentially says "just do HIIT" is just straight up bad advice for general cardiovascular fitness.   




 We're at 36 now I believe. 




 Right now Magic, Stockton, Oscar, Isaiah Thomas, and Bob Cousy are all EASILY better than Chris Paul in the "if his career ended today" sense. 

I would put him a tier back from the cousy/Thomas/Stockton group for now - somewhere alongside Rick Barry, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, and Gary Payton.

If he leads the team to a chip or goes ~4 more years at an elite level, that's another story, but no, he is not one of the five greatest of all time. 




 Are you serious? 




 Give me all the calories. All of them. 




 Nerlens Noel is making a serious charge, averaging 10.2pts/12.5rb/3.7stl/2blk in the month of March so far - and actually now has a higher PER for the season than Wiggins. But Wiggin's 15.7ppg alone puts him so far ahead of every other rookie in scoring (the next rookie who has played at least 30 games is Jordan Clarkson at 9.4ppg) that he might be too settled in the eyes of the voters. Mirotic and Nurkic might be the actual *best* playing rookies, but they simply haven't gotten the minutes to compete. Elfird Payton looks like he's going to be the best PG in the class for sure (9th best assist rate in the NBA right now as a rookie! 17th in steals/36) but he's way too deficient on offense to be considered now. Other players have had brief streaks of success  here and there (Galloway, McDaniels) but it looks like we're down to two real contenders.  




 6'2, 180lbs, 25

 - been lifting for a couple months now and am looking to move into a more intermediate routine with higher volume.
 - I've injured my knee before doing squats (and that was after a considerable amount of form work) and am deathly afraid of attempting them again, so leg work is going to have to come from other sources.
 - I'm looking to work solely on aesthetics, and for some reason my arms just blow up in proportion to my core; so I think one iso exercise for bi's/tri's *should* be enough, especially considering the amount of tertiary work they're getting in major lifts.

 Pleasantly surprised we went 7-6 three times in the past decade and still managed to be 12th overall win%. 




 I don't really want my hands to get super calloused from deadlifting, will lifting gloves help with that?
