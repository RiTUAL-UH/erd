 Go to youtube and search "food tube focaccia" that's a great video on two types of focaccia bread. I added some sun dried tomato paste to the dough for extra flavour :P 









 nah PSU is fine. In terms of performance which is better? 




 it really did... (   ) 




 Pros and cons of both these cards?

 cant that leave bits on paper behind? 




 "10 guy sounds like a cool dude, bruh" 




 I met this girl on DayZ, turns out she lived 30 miles away, skip ahead 3 years and i'm with the most beautiful amazing woman i've ever known and she's a firm believer of the PCMasterRace. I honestly think i might be the luckiest man alive for randomly meeting her online and living so close xD 




 Yeh I had the same issue. I now use a logitech G400 and it's the best mouse I've ever used. 




 Have a look at the Mionix Naos series of mice. 




 Just dont call me, im busy. 









 still dont get why Vi isnt called The Piltover Pugilist. 




 then why can you dodge fizz ult but not cait ult? doesnt that sound like a bug to you? 




 Zed can still die in his ult and Yi can still die in his Q, these bugs have been around since like season 3....
 




 you should never skimp on the PSU dude. If that fucks up, literally everything in your PC could fuck up :/ 




 It removes player choice and makes Zed extremely predictable. Bjergsen said he's completely stopped playing Zed due to it. 




 Since the last patch, every time the nexus blows up there's a new explosion noise played.

Here's my plight with the new sound; I play a lot of Zed and at the end of a game, just before we're about to win and blow up the nexus i like to quickly type "/j" (the joke emote) in which Zed says "Forbidden shadow wins!". HOWEVER since the new explosion noise has been added to the nexus blowing up, it muffles Zed's voice! This is absolutely game breaking

Riot i will be writing a strongly worded letter to your player support team each day until this is fixed. 




 "im not making mistakes" are you top 10 challenger? xD 




 If you blame your team instead of purely focusing on your mistakes then your not gonna get out of gold. You're making mistakes, you're just not seeing them. 




 Was it by badministrator? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HW2jGKfKSU list=PLA2EB9D1C236F6274 




 UGH BUT MY TEAM MATES SUCK EVEN WHEN I TELL THEM TO STOP FEEDING LIKE STUPID BRONZE KIDDIES! /s 




 there's no secret to gaining elo it's really just a case of working on what you already know like CS well, dont back when your mid laner is roaming (if you play mid that is), dont go for a kill unless you're 100% sure it'll be a success. It really is just a case of working on what you know and making small tweaks constantly. Oh and LOOK AT YOUR MAP MORE YOU DONT DO IT ENOUGH 




 lol only 3 years? 




 So you're saying they should start paying the art department less so they can pay other departments more? That would certainly cause backlash you realise right?  




 Those in charge of maintaining the severs are not the same group of people as those who make the skins.....
