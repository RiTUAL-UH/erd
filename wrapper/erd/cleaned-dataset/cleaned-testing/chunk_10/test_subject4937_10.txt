 This is not the point, nor is it the case.

There's a reason why they wanted the Xeon Phi. Because for supercomputing applications, it's either that or the (also U.S-dev'd) GPU accelerators. 

The actual point is that the U.S. just hastened the development of competitive chips (lower price, power, etc). This was probably happening already, but it was a firm kick in the ass to start kicking ass.

The people that design the policies and trade restrictions do so in a technological vacuum. 














 I wish more areas organized things like this. Was it through a group, an overnight camping-camp for younger folks? How neat for you! 




 Should be next Monday early in the morning Frankfurt time. 
























 Would love to know where on the planet this came from. I can find almandine quite easily, but nothing gemmy like this. 




 I, for one, am totally excited for the zombie apocalypse. 

The slow churn to economic misery, er, not so much. But zombies! Yes! I can do that. 




 Oddly enough all I see here are the crinoid stems and chert nodules but Oklahoma is home to the best of any of my bryozoan specimens.  









 That would be a fit then... I am not a geologist either, I study and find for fun. But I've learned quite a bit through the years. 




 I second specularite but can better confirm if I know the region/state area it came from. 




 Unfortunately HPC is a very "it depends" proposition. I don't think what you're usibg scales to that many cores anyway and honestly, CD Adaptco can advise in depth on the best cluster configuration for that application set. Then learning becomes an experience process. 




 So much CFD is done on workstations. But for building clusters turned for ANSYS and other applications, sometimes it helps to attend training sessions at user conferences. I know ANSYS has them, in fact, most do. Other integrators do training sessions for end users but would be happy to host someone looking to learn. And the universities with HPC centers would prob be willing to chat hardware with you. Always read stuff too, there's not a lot of HPC specific stuff that isn't PR from HPCwire, which used to be great before they lost their good writers, but Beowulf boards (Beowulf.org) is great for specific questions  




 What level and type? That would mean, for what purpose? As someone architecting HPC systems or programming? More detail about what the net result you're looking for will get you a direct and focused answer. 




 That is a brilliant answer, by the way.  




 Right, which is different than data capacity (i.e. storage, I/O systems, etc).. It's a pretty common bit of lingo for infrastructure folks although to the outside world it might sound a bit archaic.  









 Here I was, imagining some lovely scene--an older gentleman with a pleasant backyard shed full of fine polished wonders. All the children dropping in to see what beautiful cabochons he is working on today. And now I cannot unsee that comment. 




 Were these "freestanding" or pulled/chipped away from host sediment? 




 All watched over by the Borg Master nodes. 




 A service economy without a middle class. About as sustainable as a middle class without a service evonomy... 




 Weird... It showed up in my Google News feed like actual news.  




 I think the point was that the lecture misses the obvious points. I watched the whole thing expecting to hear something meaningful about what can practically be done about dstacenters in... Unfortunate locations. Ended up more of an amusement for 25 min of time. The fact is, why build there at all when power is cheaper outside of CA in particular. Never address. 









 Yes. My point is that the likelihood of calcite growing out amethyst like that is...suspect. 




 That does not seem like something that would actually happen. 







































 Note the subheadline....but the retail business is slogging. Luckily every single web service we rely on (from Netfllix to Reddit itself) is feeding the AWS beast. http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/reddit/ 









 TL;DR - Finally, pricing for 100Gb switching. 




 There really should be a r/PrettySlag subreddit :) 




 I saw on Mindat where there has been some amethyst dug in Oak Ridge, NC, which is an unlikely place. Do you find this other places other than western NC? I've seen bits here and there but nothing of any quality size/formation wise east of Black Mountain. 




 Amazing finds. I've picked up some of far less quality there in the open digging areas behind the "mine" in Hiddenite, but never anything like this. Is this from the mine, quarry, or digging areas at Emerald Hollow? (Which, btw, appears to contain zero in the way of any sort of emerald material)/ 




 Almost looks like bismuth that's been recrystallized. Would be interested to see what it looked like in matrix/when found. 




 The top one looked like crinoid stem bits to me. 





























 Probably did a number on a tile saw. Do you use it often for finds and does it work well? 









 Finally the mainstream press does something to give the average reader some context. This is well done. 














 Hah! Perfect response.... and about the right era too. 



















 My only find of this nature was in southern California and only a tiny fragment in some ugly host rock. Forgot how -alien- these things look--almost fake.
