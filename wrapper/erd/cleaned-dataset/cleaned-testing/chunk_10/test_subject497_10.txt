 "Prakash" was using an alias from the outset, besides which he was no innocent man. 

But, I have his lap-top now, and all his accounts were logged in when I found it in his living room. I don't much care if his reputation, and my confession get buried as far down as him.  




 That after his death his online accounts will be anonymously usurped and his reputation ruined.  




 I'm *really* sorry to hear about your sister, man. Do whatever you can to defender her, once you get out. Creepy-ass brothel owner...I tell you man, it's this damn city. It attracts the worst kind.  




 Nothing but great things, I'm sure. ;) 




 This Twigsy guy really knows his craft. I've got to respect that on some level.  




 You vaguely remind me of my creepy-ass, late brother-in-law.
 




 Aneurysm my ass, she was young and in great health, doesn't make sense.  




 I truly regret leaving home at age 16. They say I was estranged, but really Diane was the strange one. I may have spent my better years rabble-rousing and getting into trouble but that's how you turn out when you're a dumb-ass kid who runs away from home.

I just don't see how my parents let Diane turn out the way she did. By the time I was back in my baby sister's life, she was married to this sleazy, disingenuous "Prakash", guy. Now, I'm a born again Christian, that's why I ultimately turned myself around and came back home. But Prakash, he was hard to place. When I tried to talk to him about matters of faith, he'd claim to be an atheist, or agnostic. Or he'd say "There are many paths to God.", dodgy as fuck if you ask me, most likely because he came from some ass-backwards terrorist background.

I could tell, because Diane talked like she was part of some kooky spiritual cult. Plus, she was always acting like some provincial house wife: cooking for him, and tidying their home like a neurotic house keeper... Oppressive bastard.

Well, shortly after I returned from my exploits as prodigal son, Prakash stole my chance to make up for lost time with my beloved sister. Maybe he did it because he knew I could help her see the light again: the light of Christ, the light of her own upbringing, the light of modern society - the light to which my sweet sister had sympathetically blindfolded herself, on account of her marriage to that morally blind terrorist creep.

I find the circumstances of Diane's death highly suspicious, as there were no witness besides Prakash. And, do you know what that mother fucker did, right after killing my dear sister? He took a three week vaction to India. He took Diane's ashes along with him, selfish bastard. So now we don't even have a grave site to visit her at. He claimed that she had mentioned, on a few occasions, wishing that her ashes be placed in some "Yamina River". Why on earth would my sister want a nutty thing like that?

Well, according to Prakash, he believed Diane sent him out on this wild quest because she secretly thought it would be good for him. That she would have wanted him to take his mind off his grief by going on an adventure, and finally getting in touch with his distant family members in India.

Sure, Prakash. I'm so sure Diane's final wishes were all about you, man. I'm sure she was so concerned about helping you find some inner-peace-enlightenment-bullshit at the bottom of some filthy river. Right. It wasn't so you could go search for a new terrorist bride or anything like that at all, now was it...

But by now you can see, why Prakash had to die.

I went over to his house, around ten at night. I brought two six packs of beer, thinking it would make my job easier, but from the look and smell of him when he opened the door I could tell what I brought was negligible compared to what he'd already imbibed.
I told him I was missing Diane, and asked if I could come in and chat. He let me in, and cleared some blankets off the living room couch so we could sit. The living room was a mess, the coffee table was littered with excessively dogeared and folded-open books. 

Empty beer cans adorned the floor. I shoved some books out of the way (knocking some to the floor to join the beer cans) to make room for the six packs.

Prakash seemed amiable enough, but drunk and half asleep. After enough small talk and beer was had, I got down to the heart of the matter. "I miss my sister, Prakash. I hadn't seen her in such a long time, and once I was finally back in her life, she was taken from me." I had hoped this would stir something in that guilty conscience of his, but he just muttered some self-righteous bullshit about her being in a better place.

I finally cut to the chase. "Did you kill her, Prakash?" My question seemed to cut through his stupor, as he stared at me, wide eyed, and stammered a denial.

"Well, we'll let fate decide, shall we." I said as I produced the first gun from my jacket. Prakash watched as I loaded a single bullet, and spun the cylinder.

I set the gun down on the table in front of us, then produced the second (fully loaded) gun and trained it on Prakash. "This is called Russian Roulette. I know you killed my sister, now this is your judgement day. If you refuse to let God be your judge, then I will be your judge. Now, there is an eleven in twelve chance you will be spared. Do you really think God would let that one in twelve bullet find it's way into your head, if you're truly an innocent man?"

"My God, Don, I didn't kill her! I loved her! I still love her! I did not kill Diane!" he shouted, sweat now beading up on his face.

"Don't invoke God if you're not willing to let him judge you." I said. "And, believe me when I say I am up to the task of acting on his behalf. Your deadline is fast approaching Prakash. Decide and make your peace. 10...9..."

As I began my count down Prakash cast about the room as though looking for escape or help, and I leaned in closer with my own gun, inches from his face. He picked up the gun from the table and held it to his head. His breath quickened until he was practically hyperventilating. 

With his other hand he picked up a near by picture of Diane and stared at it. I was hoping he'd utter a confession or an apology. "Truth alone triumphs." he said in a quavering voice, and then pulled the trigger.

The gun emitted an impotent "click" and nothing more... 

*God Dammit! do I have to do everything myself!? What the hell happened to that sure-fire bullet I'd left in the chamber!? Had the fucking thing jammed!? Oh well, I guess God does help those who help themselves.* 

I grabbed a pillow and shoved it against the back of Prakash's head, while he was vomiting on the floor. The silencer and pillow reduced the sound and mess of the gunshot.

A garbage bag nicely concealed the body and accompanying evidence, as I loaded them into my truck. An apparent suicide would have been more ideal, but from what I understand Prakash was sort of the black sheep of his own family. And if there's one thing I've learned it's that when you're a black sheep, no one looks 
very hard for you.

I drove Prakash's body so far into the dessert, that it'll be at least a decade before the shores of our ever expanding city approach it, and buried it so far down that even the vultures will never get a tantalizing glimpse.

See you in hell, asshole. 




 Thanks a lot, yaar :) 




 Thank you.
