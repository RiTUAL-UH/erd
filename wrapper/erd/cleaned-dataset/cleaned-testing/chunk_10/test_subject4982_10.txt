 Mine were raised. Looked just like hers actually. My doctor said it was a remedy that could be used either way.  




 Is it common to find typos? I took a picture but I cannot submit it. (On Relay)  




 Not at all. I prefer it that way. My friends tend to bicker and that is a constant buzz kill. I like to do them in my basement and watch Netflix. Unless I'm with my boyfriend. Then we just do stupid shit and fuck for hours.  




 So I get this. Especially on my bikini line. My pediatrician told me two weeks ago, to go to the dollar store, buy the Athletes foot cream, whatever one they have, and baby powder. Apply after a shower. First the cream, then the powder. After a few days it goes away. And mine was worse than this. It also surprisingly got rid of the dark spots. Now, I'm not an expert and everyone's bodies reacts differently to things- so it is merely a remedy. I cannot promise anything but I hope that maybe it helps! 


EDIT: Make sure when you do apply these two easy steps, it is to dry skin. Try not to out on underwear right after. My suggestion would be after a shower before bed. Sleep commando.  




 MONKFISH 




 I am terrified of looking into the sky at any time of day/night.

 Wait......... 




 I wouldn't punch you. Maybe just back hand ya. Or shake you. I can't decide. You look like my brother that's why....no hard feelings right?  




 Ohhhhh typical Temprance/Bedford behavior. Gotta love Michigan drivers. To people in Ohio, especially Toledo (bordered) Michigan drivers drive like someone lit them on fire. As ex dispatcher for NWO police majority of our accidents happen with Michigan drivers.

EDIT: I shouldn't say majority. But lots. Follow the traffic laws and all should be okay. Everyone rushes around here like traffic is that bad. Rush hour traffic in Toledo most you'd have to wait is an hour. Any where else- triple that.  




 Guilty. 




 Thank you! Lololll that is perfection 




 I need to meet these men. 




 I still think Jennifer Garner is a bitch for coming into the picture when he was with JLo. And I also still think that Afleck and JLo would be together to this day if it weren't for Garner. And we all know JLo is a ride or die kind of girl (Diddy shooting stint) so when it came to Aflecks friends (Kevin Smith) I doubt she would have objected to the friendship. She probably would have been the one handing him the Zippo for his smoke seshs anyways. Garner seems like an uptight bitch. Her little winced smile like the head of a dildo is going up her ass at all times. Idk there is something about Garner.... Something is off with her. 


End rant about people I don't know and will never meet. 




 What happened?  




 My cottage in southern Ohio was build on an old Amish farm. Our lake was created by a damn, it is about 6 miles long. All the houses are in the bays of the lake. So anyways..

I was in bed one night and a little girl with long blonde hair in a white baptismal gown appeared at the foot of my bed. My younger cousin was in the room with me. When I saw her I tried to scream but no sound was coming from me. I could feel my chest getting tense. Anyways, this little girl said to me "SWIM!" after she said that she looked as if she was suffocating. I was totally spooked. Did some research and asked a few neighbors after that night if they had experienced anything. Apparently this little Amish girl drown in the lake right after the water had settled and she went from house to house warning people to not go in. 

I embrace her now since she has such a sad story but truthfully....she still scared me a little.  




 I've always been pretty sensitive since I have been younger, honestly I know he is a good guy just territorial. 

I have always been pretty lax around my house and others, always keep things clean but I have a bad habit of leaving doors and things open, in the past he has shut them right in front of me. He's territorial and doesn't like things messed up. 

So I need to do a better job of respecting that. In the end I think he is just looking out.  




 So I'm house sitting again for my neighbors that I have previously posted about before. We did tell her father-in-law the day I arrived that I would be here and so far so good. A few subtle things like shutting doors, opening and shutting of drawers in the bed room. But nothing that has actually made me scared.

He was playing fetch with one of the dogs the other day. The dogs toy would move slowly around the room and the dog was chasing it. My mother actually witnessed this happening. She couldn't believe her eyes. 

Glad he's getting to be more comfortable around me.  




 FRANK. 




 Can we see full with like a semi? I'm just so curious.  




 I slept with my best friends step dad when I was 20. He was in my college town for business. Always was attracted to him. He would always randomly hand us $100 in high school and on vacations and shit.  He was handsome, wealthy and I never really thought of him as her 'father/step father'. It happened and it was amazing. When she found out, she laughed. Said I wasn't the only one who had thought about it. But I was the only one to do it. She wasn't upset. Still isn't. We see one another weekly. I guess I got off easy. I still see him randomly, but I am in an amazing happy relationship. 


EDIT: When I said "We see one another weekly." I mean my friend. Not him. I am in a great relationship.

 OMG THAT'S THE WORST! I'm so sorry that happened to you.  




 LONG LIVE TAYLOR SWIFT.









Was never a fan of hers until this album. CHEERS TAYLOR. 




 That's what I'm going to ask them to do. They leave in a few days and will be back in August will keep you posted!  




 From my understanding and the stories she and her husband have told me is that, he will turn on and off lights. When the kids are done playing in a room and forget to turn off a light, they would see them go off. Whenever any of their children wake up at night to use the restroom or get a glass of water, he will willingly turn on lights BEFORE they enter the room. Like he knows where they are going. 

He has never truly harmed me, just scared me a few times. I wonder what I did wrong to him because from what I am told he was a nice man. Just didn't like change. I plan on staying the whole month- because it is a vacation to me being out of my parents house. I work so much (in a restaurant so strange hours) that I leave the dogs home all day and they like the company so of course I will sleep there. 

I will just have to sit down and have a conversation with him. Let him know I mean no harm.

I live in Sylvania, OH. What some people fail to mention about this cemetery is that it is in a neighborhood.  My friends and I would smoke weed out in the cemetery every once in a while. This day in particular, we hadn't smoked yet and we heard a woman weeping. We decided not to smoke and investigate instead. 

About 30 minutes in we heard a woman weeping again. Then she asked "Where are they?!' We knew right then and there it was the woman looking for her husband's. We couldn't believe it. Needless to say we all ran like chickens. Couldn't believe what we had heard. It has been about 6 years and I can still hear the voice plain as day.  




 She has told me before that she always knew he was there but activity didn't start until they started making changes on the house. New floors, windows, ect. I don't mind that he is there, I just want him to be comfortable with me and my boyfriend.  




 They encourage me to have my boyfriend and certain friends over they don't mind at all! I've been house sitting for them for about 3 years now. I just feel as if he doesn't like me personally. I don't know. I want to sage the house but I would have to ask them before I did  




 So I house sit for my across the street neighbors once a month. Typically for a weekend sometimes a couple weeks. Great money. Watch the dogs and Ghost Adventures the whole time. Since my parents live across the street I feel safe. And since my neighbors have known me for so long I sometimes will have small get togethers with my friends or my significant other.

I have mentioned in other posts that I am somewhat sensitive. Normally things with spirits don't bother me much.


 Anyways...her father-in-law passed away in the house about 15 years ago. These are bigger houses, and if you are down stairs the only way someone upstairs could hear you is if you are extremely loud. Like making a point for someone to hear you.

So my S/O was really pissing me off this night in particular. He said he was coming over but got trashed instead. I kept telling him to get a cab and come over since I was lonely and quite honestly just wanted to cuddle. That's when it all happened...

 I was upstairs in the master bedroom watching television as I was falling asleep. About an hour after I fell asleep, I was sleeping on my right side, I felt someone push me onto my back and then pull the sheets off of the bed. I stayed as calm as possible. Went downstairs to let the dogs out and smoke a cigarette. When I got down there every light was on, the stove was on and the television was on. They have an amazing security system and I never worry about break ins. Plus my handy pistol is always by my side. 

I turned everything off, smoked my cigarette, got the dogs in,
 brushed my teeth and went back upstairs. About two hours later the same thing happened again. Pushed onto my back and the sheets were pulled off the bed. 

This time I heard a very loud bang. Shook the walls a little. I flew out of bed. At this point I knew someone was in the house fucking with me. I thought it was my man being drunk and stumbling around. But being me I grabbed my pistol and checked every room upstairs and carefully made my way down stairs. No one was in the house. Every light was on. Every cabinet was open. Stove was on. Television was on. The dogs were hiding in the laundry room. I called my man and he said he was still out and that he would be over soon. I stayed up and waited for him. 

When he arrived an hour later we went upstairs and laid down. He was holding me and all of a sudden his arm was yanked off. We both lost it. I have never been so terrified in my life. I called my neighbors and told them what happened. She told me to not worry about it that I was probably just her father-in-law. That he was never a fan of other people in his house and that I should talk to him and explain that I was there to take care of the animals and the house. Make sure everything was okay and safe while his son and daughter were out of town. 


I go back next week for a month while they go to their other home in California. I'm absolutely terrified to go back. 

How can I make this right with her late father-in-law?  




 Not yet lol
