 Would probably say it isn't a dystopia, though. 




 It hurts me to hear that. It really does.
 




 Now, if it wasn't for *The Buried Giant* I wouldn't have read *Never Let Me Go*. But I didn't enjoy it as much. 




 Bad prose: E.L James, Stephanie Meyer, a fair portion of contemporary YA fiction. 

Good prose: Most any classic, Stoner^^^1, McEwan, Never Let Me Go^^^2, The Kingkiller Chronicles^^^3.

(A lot of these are maybe somewhat opinion but I think in the most, they hold up)

1. By John Williams (Not the composer). *Read it!*

2. By Kazuo Ishiguro. *Read it!*

3. By Patrick Rothfuss. *Read it!* 




 The only book that's ever really done this for me was "The Virgin Suicides". Which was intense. I've heard really good things about All the Light We Cannot See, but I'm not sure about it.

When you've finished Never Let Me Go, let me know what you thought of it. 




 No. Because I do this at the end of a book. And At the end of a book, I'm almost always enraptured. So whilst I am quite excited for my next book, I wouldn't forego the ending of my current book for it. 




 Just looked over my bookshelf to "Catch-22", but maybe you're right. Perhaps I should read "Ready Player One" now instead. Or "Lolita"... 




 I'm trying to take my mind off the book and it isn't working. :(

I really want to see the film now. I was reading the book and could just absolutely see the actors as the characters. Garfield as Tommy was just too good, especially in my head.  




 Agreed. I still haven't seen the *Brotherhood* version though. 




 You thought that way about your furniture and your first thought wasn't to start a fight club? 




 *"the pleasure of a dream is that it was a fantasy, if it happens it was never a dream."*

Just wanted to discuss the quote and if you agree with it. Agree with it *to some extent*, or think it's baloney.

The quote is from *The Fullmetal Alchemist.* 




 Praise be to our lord and saviour, Neil Gaiman. Blessed be his name. 




 Very few books, if any, have ever made me feel quite like this. Definitely more rare, is that I have to take a while to digest a book. I don't think I'll be able to forget about this one for a while. One of the most heart-breakingly true and human books ever written. 




 Allow me to summarise my feelings:

#AAAAAARRGGHHH! 




 Does that animated sequence in Kill Bill count? 'Cause that was pretty amazing. 




 It has a good ending. I will give it that. A fair bit of a twist. 




 I find inspiration can last maybe 5k words. I think once I got it to 15k on a short. After that it's just sheer will-power to sit down and write. 

For shorter shorts, and poetry though, I wouldn't write without a decent amount of initial inspiration.  




 The trick is to work without inspiration. Maybe doesn't work so well for poetry, though. I admit, you gotta be inspired for that. But for novel writing, inspiration is a useless dream. 




 No. You must suffer for cheating and learn from your mistakes. Paper Towns is a pretty excellent book, with a decent ending. You've ruined that now, nothing can be done. Just don't do it again! 




 Hey thanks for the feedback. It's good to know I'm not alone!

Why can't you read American Gods? It honestly is an amazing book. But if you're convinced to read Gaiman, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is simply amazing, too. 




 The Simpsons Movie.

I haven't heard anyone say anything but "it was naff on the first watch, but suddenly fucking amazing on the second and from then on." 




 Apology accepted. Otherwise, Neeson is a perfectly acceptable answer. 




 Missed the whole *actress* thing, didn't you? 




 I'm not sure it really matters. His books are all so good and so incomparable. Neverwhere. The Ocean at the End of the Lane. American Gods. The Graveyard Book. They're all excellent. 




 Superhero movie at 4.5.

Because nothing says perfection through imperfection like that piece of shit film that made me cry so many times. 




 Ah, I don't know why but Marvel release in England before America. But we still haven't gotten Inside Out yet, which sucks major balls. 

What type of book. err, is hard to put down. It's I suppose horror, with touches of YA and fantasy. I struggle to define it. It's about malevolent spirits and how the two protagonists are affected at different times in their lives. 




 Male, 23 from England. I'm waiting for a phone call for the hours on my new job. Which sucks. So really I'm just writing my novel, seeing if my friend will wake up so we can go and see **Ant-Man!** 




 Yuh-uh. I just went on and it says it's open. Let me download it though I haven't tried playing it. But it does say it's good to go. 




 Once upon a time, there was a unicorn. 




 It's a composite. It's really just one picture. The video is just the best way of getting across what the picture is actually for. There might be a way to zoom in on bits and pieces on an actual website, but I find the video does the job well enough.

So, what is really wrong with it? 




 [This picture.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udAL48P5NJU) 




 Yeah. I thought it was pretty obvious (with the new look) that it would be a different Joker origin. Nolan didn't quite go with canon anyway for Ledger. And then WB put a new spin on Leto's joker with an alternative origin. 

They pretty much had to do that, though. So it wasn't so similar to Ledger/Nolan. And so it fit in with the comic-book arc.  




 Unicorns.

(The logic of this question dictates that 'not-existing' isn't a suitable answer). 




 Someone else as in, from a different origin? 

I don't mind that they're doing something different with him. And I don't blame them for taking steps to differentiate between the last incarnation so recently after it. I just think they're more worried than they need to be. Comparisons are bound to be made, but, honestly, the films won't even be slightly similar.  




 Compared to some of the more recent trailers, it feels like SS and BvS have been very bare. I know SS is more of a teaser, so we'll have to wait and see on that one but so far so good.

The spray paint on Superman for felt like it was just putting the audience into the right point within the film - so we know how that film-universe feels about Superman. The God imagery did get a bit too much in Man of Steel, so I do hope they tone down in this one. Especially with all of the controversy about him.

My feelings with the Joker is that it's too conscientiously different from Ledger's. They've looked at how Nolan does it and then contrived to go in as far the opposite direction as possible. 




 Watched video.

Is now downloading game.

50% to test this for myself. 




 Man, I was like...10 when it came out.

But up until Fellowship there was huge scepticism that the books couldn't be turned into films. They simply couldn't be made. Obviously Jackson showed them. 




 I assume you've also seen the SS trailer? 

Thoughts on Leto's Joker? 




 LOTR marathon.

That is all. 




 Isn't Aquaman in it too? Whoop! 

I understand what you mean about Superman and his motives. But to me it looks like it really will be Batman attacking and Superman defending. Then, when humanity turns on him, he might just take it all out on Batman, who is kinda provoking him, and kick his ass. 

I never really had a fault with Man of Steel. The whole reason to side against Zod was so as not to doom an entire race. That makes sense. So now that he's saved Earth, the humans turn on him, and Batman is at the forefront of that. That feels like Superman's motivations to me.

I'm just excited to see how it goes in with the Suicide Squad, and the Joker. Well, not just excited. Also excited. 




 I mean, yeah, war-out. But does it really matter who loves a thing more than you do? As long as you both love it and can talk passionately about it, who cares who claims to love it more?

But, more importantly, what *did* you think of the BvS trailer? 




 I am patriotically obliged to say Tea.

British problems. 




 I think McEwan's longer novels aren't as good as his shorter ones (except *The Children Act*). So I liked *The Cement Garden* and *On Chesil Beach* a fair bit more than *Atonement*. I think *Sweet Tooth* is the exception to that rule, because I quite liked that, a touch more than Atonement. I couldn't even finish *Solar*, but I might come back to that one now I'm a bit older. 

Ok, I'll read Amsterdam last :) 




 Man, I didn't even pick up on that. Mind you when I finally finished Atonement I was pretty done with it. Yeah, I remember thinking that Tom having written it wasn't particularly special. I'm telling you, I don't think he'll be able to top 'On Chesil beach'. But I need to read Amsterdam, Saturday and Enduring Love before I commit to that. 




 Thanks, Ramona. 




 *On Chesil Beach*, by Ian McEwan 




 Thanks, Scott :) 




 (third week running :D)

Leave any fact you know or can think of off the top of your head. If you have to google it, you're cheating. GO! 




 I'm sorry I read this so long ago I cannot remember it. Remind me which bit. :(

 They're only 12! 




 Mac's aren't difficult. But if you're only used to PC and come over, I understand there is an initial moment of sheer befuddlement.

(P.S - Word of the day: befuddlement.)  




 A rainbow beam fighting a volcanic eruption. 




 Awesome! (Y) 




 Ah, good good. The amount of people I've heard panic when they first see a Mac having only ever used Windows their entire life. It makes me giggle. (I was the first time I used a Mac). 




 For the love of GOD. 

Have to admit though, controller responsiveness is one I've never heard of. Having both consoles, I've never had an issue with responsiveness on either. Ever. 

Best way to decide is which console will have games with split screen support.

(Spoiler: it's neither the XB1 or PS4. It's the Wii U). 




 This is a really long Saturday. I got up to go to my little brother's party really early and got back so I'm just sat here, reading my book. You got a Mac? First time using an Apple PC? 




 So the OP can drown in the multitudinous millions of others who moved there solely with the dream to write, act, direct or sing?   




 I was in a relationship for five years. When we broke up she got all our friends, and I contacted an old friend from school. I met his girlfriend and we talked about books for the whole meal (we met over dinner). 

We aren't really friends. But I wish I had someone I saw often who I could talk to about things that interest me. 




 Because more people have bought a PS4, so they charge more knowing they can get more money :) 




 Cinema 4DS or equivalent.

If you don't even know what the program is, then there's no way you're going to be able to start throwing out CGI like that. It isn't simple or easy. 

As for pre-rendered ones. They might exist, but not cheap. 




 Major spoilers did. 

[But if you're still interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIBSEBj6YhQ) 




 The opening to The Dark Knight Rises? Nolan genuinely ripped a plane apart and dangled it vertically from another. No CGI. 




 Get them classics in: 1984, Great Gatsby, Slaughterouse-5. All fantastic novels.

Otherwise I recommend anything on earth by Neil Gaiman :)

(Please note anything on earth is not a book. I'm just saying that anything with the name Nail Gaiman on, pick it up.) 




 It was sobs of both. Happiness I'd been able to get it done, and it was finished. And then sad because it was finished and I had killed off a main character and it was very sad :( 




 ...Drumming.

It's about drumming.

J.k Simmons is just amazing, it's just worth watching the entire film for his performance. I did just try and summarise it but I can't do the film justice, so look it up on IMDB, find a proper synopsis is my advice. But just watch it, honestly. It is simply amazing. 




 **Whiplash**

11ty-twelve out of five. 




 Make friends. The only way to survive menial jobs like fast-food is to have good people to look forward to spending your shift with. 




 I was using the example given by the OP. That's all. 




 Assuming you're ok with how much time that would take to edit a few completed manuscripts in one go. Real pain in the ass, editing is. I wouldn't want to do more than one novel at a time. 




 So many of these theories are pretty much accepted now, which is a bit of a shame. Auri is a namer. A powerful one. Meluan Lackless is Kvothe's aunt. All this stuff about the Chandrian, and Mr. Ash, and whether or not Denna is one of the Chandrian; there is some pretty good theories about all of these but I don't remember them. 




 Except in games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age 2, or any game where the protagonist has a flagship appearance that you probably shouldn't change. 




 I think pain and infection are your main concerns, so just check them. Otherwise, you have the blessing of at least one total stranger on the internet :) 




 I was born in the 90's and I wouldn't miss out on films from the 80's or before just because of it.  




 Ok, under foot isn't too bad. But if you go too deep you'll massively hurt yourself and might not be able to walk on it for a while. 

You know how to work the gun?

And if you do do it, at least you know how to take care of it. I wouldn't skimp out on washing it thoroughly. Twice as thoroughly as any other tattoo you have. 




 Unless you're going to do this dot-by-dot, I don't imagine using the gun is as simple as it seems. Also sterilisation and care. Have you seen infected tattoos? Also, if you are heavily tattooed the last thing you want/need is some squiggly uneven black mark messing it up. Because - let's face it - you're not going to do a fantastic job :/ 




 Depends on traditional or self-publishing.

Also, probably not worth trying to publish your first novel. That's the rule of thumb. Gotta get that practice in, and write a few more. 




 People like Anita S are barely journalists though. In the case of Anita S, she isn't even talking about games that could be described as even approaching journalistic. Reviewers, and magazines (both on and offline) entail journalism. You're suggesting imposing restrictions on people who don't need restrictions. People like Anita S (to use your example) are well known within the community. Any decent journalist the viewers would know to trust thanks to word of mouth, and would therefore not need these checks.  




 Whoa, you read *The Philosopher's Stone* and then skipped ahead to *The Deathly Hallows*? The films can't fill in that gap. 




 Your reaction to finish a book was so different to mine. I broke down into tears and just held my face for a little while, sobbing.  




 Look at the different areas of gaming and see which one you want to do most, which one you think you're best at. Modelling, concept art, texturing, programming, etc.

And then just learn it. There are plenty of free tools to learn how to use them, and just make something. If you get Unity the 'Tornado Twins' have a brilliant tutorial covering the entire basics for Unity.  




 Jump into the genre. The same way she made us wait for the midnight release of GTAV on PS3 and she literally never played it. Or TLOU, which she never played. Which didn't stop er buying the remaster. 




 Breaking into the industry isn't easy. And you might think with all of these indie games clawing for air every five seconds, you might find a place. But the thing is for every game there's another hundred guys trying to break into the industry. For every game another dozen never get finished.

Learn a skill, make yourself stand out. You have to do something. Programming. Art. A lot of indie studios take on writers now. Look into it. It's something you can do as a hobby on the side. Learn Unity or Unreal Engine. Practice making your own stuff. It's difficult. Hella difficult. I failed at it. But, hey, who said dreams ought to be easy? 




 No one. Even if you could bring together a team of dedicated devs guess who would be wholly obsolete? Guess who would get kicked out first.

Everyone has an idea. The industry doesn't need idea's people.

Sorry - I know that was harsh. 




 Are there are a lot of books about this? I never seem to find any

Are they just boring? Does no one like them? Have they been played out? I just think it's strange for a fairly large subject to see very little about it. 




 I've been listening to 'The Amy Trilogy' non-stop. Also 'I Still Believe', 'If Ever I Stray' and 'Get Better'. And others but eh... 




 Frank Turner.

My friend put it on when we were driving back after a weekend away. That was three weeks ago, haven't stopped listening to him since. 




 As long as they're not BNP or ridicuously UKIP, I don't care. 




 Ni No Kuni. That was amazing. And so were the graphics. That game was absolutely eschewing for GOTY and then TLOU came out damnit.  




 Instant win for band name. 




 Hey, I just wanna come back to something.

*What the holy fuck is Library Science?* 




 I'd like to see him do a space movie. Like A Space Odyssey. I think that would be a good watch. 




 Not me, but my girlfriend, bought the Watchdogs collectors edition. Boy did she regret that. 




 All right, I don't wanna write a novel. 




 In just the SS trailer saw origin for Harley Quinn, Enchantress and Deadshot. Maybe for Joker as well. Just makes me think what the SS movies are going to be. Because whatever happens they're gunna shoehorn all these movies together. 




 The thing about DC is that it absolutely feels like their shoe-horning characters together to compete with The Avengers. That might not be the case. But a film with introducing a new Batman, Wonder-Woman and Aquaman might be a bit much.

As for the suicide squad...the entire trailer felt like just a frame to introduce The Joker at the end. There was nothing else to it. A few character snaps and then Leto. And my concern for Leto's Joker is that it's possibly going to be based mainly on ensuring that it isn't like Ledger's uber-succesful one. This isn't a criticism of the film, just that trailer. There's also no way that we can see as much of the characters SS as we would want to. So some are going to get left behind.

And I like that DC are being more gritty. I love the MCU but I'm really dying to see something else. 




 Nostalgic re-read. 




 She growled, "I hate you."

Period before the speech mark. 




 *noise of a plane going down, going down. Crashing. -Explosion-* 




 Read the first chapter and run-on sentence is right.

The man wakes alert for something had woken him, he looks over to his wife in the bed beside him and sees her missing he grabs the knife from under his pillow and looks around his room.

The man wakes. Alert. Something had woken him. He looks over to the empty space beside him and sees his wife his missing. He grabs the knife from under his pillow and looks around his room.

Real-long sentence. Also, he looks over to his wife, who isn't there, so he can't look over to his wife. 

Rule of thumb is to not show your work to anyone until it's 100% finished. If not finished, then 200% polished. 




 City of God. Because I need at least 24 hours to psyche myself up for it, and mentally prepare myself, and I never seem to have the time.  




 I love this. What a weird thing to fear, something you'd never expect to happen. It's just funny because a few years ago this would have been impossible.  




 That's great to hear thanks. Don't have to go and change my entire 100k word novel now. Phew. 




 That makes sense, it's just that I've seen it used both ways. For example the book I'm reading now, by an English author, uses 'these.' But another English book I have uses "these". Why are there no laws! 




 "Goddamnit," he cursed. Well, at least my first novel is right then. 




 Tarantino

Nolan

Coppola

Anderson

Von Trier

As a film graduate myself, being familiar with any director's body of work, and being able to reference it, is a massive help. 

 




 When you write speech, do you put "" or ''

So

"Hi," she said.

Or

'Hi,' he said.

This is stupid. And, having written an entire novel, I really should know this. I do not. Does it matter? 




 Just finished Lullaby, by Palahniuk. 

Now reading; Ptolemy's Gate, by Jonathan Stroud. 




 This is a pretty neat book. I read it a few months ago, not long after it's release. I quite enjoyed it. Was different to anything I had ever read. 




 **Ptolemy's Gate, by Jonathan Stroud** 




 Well EA was just the example given to me. But of course the studios they buy out, yeah, they screw over. 




 Yes, this one is Bethesda. Don't you worry. 




 You know who Bethesda are right? 




 Hello again bunnywhispers :) 




 I think EA actually develop and publish games themselves. They do everything. I think. Obviously that doesn't say a lot for the team who make the game but still... 




 Just have to say, the gaming studios aren't the blame. It's the publishers. Never (rarely) blame the publishers, they want to make the best game they can. It's their publishers who are to blame. 




 Holy crap that's a convoluted title. 




 Well she answered. So she didn't seem to mind. Obviously *she*, and it was *her* sex life, didn't seem to mind the question. 




 I just use Open Office. I just sit at my desk every day and pump out words. I don't use GDocs or Dropbox because I like to keep everything on my laptop (I have back-ups). Writing on my phone, or anything that wasn't a PC doesn't appeal to me in the least.
