 I asked Harvey Smith about Corvo's personality, here's what he said: 

"the kind of man who loves only once. passionate, but private. guarded, analytical, equally prone to long periods of study and caution, and quick outbreaks of creative violence..."

I also asked him what he and the Empress did in there spare time, together. 

"smoke a pipe, play small stringed instruments, climb and swim, cook over an open fire, take small boats out sailing"

[Harvey Smith's Twitter](https://twitter.com/Harvey1966/with_replies) 














 What does is say about Corvo? 




 Just reading that was intense. 




 La Seydoux is crazy attractive. 

 




 yes 




 Silver Linings Playbooks. Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it and watch it.

Grand Budapest Hotel. 

Chef 




 Just want to know if the Dunwall Archives Dishonored book is really worth getting. I'm a hardcore fan of the game, has anyone got it? What's it like? 




 Wow. I never find all the money. I usually miss out on 1-2 grand. 




 Yeah I asked him.

I also asked him about Corvo's personality as well. He said he's passionate but private, guarded, analytical equally prone to long periods of caution and study. The kind of man who loves only once. I also asked him what he and the Empress did in their spare time, just look on his replies. I am NathanLabesius as well as DamienLee. I made two accounts so he wouldn't get sick of one user asking him questions all the time. 

His twitter is like a constant AMA.  




 The Sixth Sense and Fight Club. 









 Nostalgia trip/10. 




 With narration and mostly handheld camera shots from Emmanuel Lubezki. 




 But Craig is still signed on for one more Bond after Spectre, I'm pretty sure, so who should direct Craig's last Bond? 




 November, december maybe 




 I agree. He was pretty much just used for like 2 scenes in DOFP. I hope that doesn't become a thing. 




 You should probably spoiler-tag that shit up 




 Look how old Emily is.  




 Glad to hear. That scene from Days of Future Past was nothing short of brilliant. He's a better quicksilver than Aaron Taylor Johnson from Age of Ultron, IMO, but he was still pretty good. 




 American Beauty.

In a good way. 









 You don't have to download it, it's simply an audio thing, you just have to press play. 




 Made a separate account just so I could ask some more questions, got some good stuff about D2 out of him: https://twitter.com/DamienLee1358/status/622440300485611520

 




 One of the best memes I've seen in a while. 




 I think you just answered the question. 









 Not confirmed. This is just speculation. However with a new plague in D2 there will most likely be new type of weepers, 'Howlers' maybe. 




 What does SFM stand for? 









 Billie Lurk   Thomas. 




 Yes 




 What your asking is for Pixar to introduce completely new characters. That might not fit well with most kids. 




 I think Warcraft is going to be fantastic. I mean, this is they guy who wrote and directed 'Moon' as well as directing 'Source Code'. I have no doubt that this guy knows what he's doing.

 The Revenant (for me) is a must watch

Sicario. Denis Villenueve's new film. Along with Deakins shooting, you can't go wrong.

Star Wars. Duh.

Hateful Eight. Tarantino's new movie gotta see it. 

Steve Jobs. Bound to win some oscars.

Spectre. Skyfall was fucking spectacular, hope this tops it.

Ant-Man. I'll give it a shot.

Southpaw. Love Jake Gyllenhaal.

MI5: Rogue Nation. Looks awesome, loved the 4th one.

I've probably missed heaps but those are my main ones. 




 All the while he was still acting.


He probably will lose to some pretentious garbage piece of shit performance. 




 Guards also say Blow off choffer as well. 














 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnsDyv-TtJg

Just before we see the body with insects coming out of his guts, on the wall it says 'Howlers come at night'. Because of this new plague that'll be in the game, I think these 'Howlers' will be a new type of weeper. 

Also, those new tallaboy robot guard things look like they have eyes on their lower back. That'll make for an interesting challenge. I could be wrong though. 




 I doubt it. 









 I've waiting for this since day fucking one. Lubezki's cinematography looks fantastic, as does DiCaprio of course. This'll be winning some major Oscars.

Loving the beautiful wide shots. 




 This deserves a remake. 




 Still won't be as good as if Fukunaga directed it. This'll most likely end up being PG-13, which fucking sucks, as the book is purely meant for adults.

 I can hardly recognize Oscar Isaac. Finally a villain who can fuck up all the X-Men. I've been waiting for this. 




 A girl goes on a acid trip. You'll never guess it. 




 Crown killer? Does that mean Corvo? Will there be some Corvo/masked felon legacy? That's exciting.  




 Harvey Smith said a while back that Corvo canonically spared Daud. However you're better off asking him on his twitter account. Don't ask too much though, make the question as simple as possible. He replies sometimes if your question in simple enough. 









 You need more gold. 




 Gal Gadot is crazy attractive.  




 Always thought it was just full of weepers. 




 I preferred him with long hair. He still looks experienced as fuck though.  




 In the flooded district when you have to pass all the tallboys if you are on low chaos there will be a house full of survivors. There's a side mission where to have to help them get to safety and make a safe haven for them. I had no idea it existed. 









 What does 70mm look like? I haven't seen the Master in a while but I thought It had a 1:85:1 aspect ratio? 




 A while ago it was announced that Ryan Gosling is set to start, Denis Villenueve is set to direct and Roger Deakins is set to shoot the film. I guess you already know that Harrison Ford is returning. 




 LOVED Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle. I hope this tops both. Cooper in a supporting role though?  














 I intend to take influence from the world of Dishonored, if you don't know what that is, it's a video game set in the fictional city of Dunwall in the Isles. You can read more about it [here](http://dishonored.wikia.com/wiki/Dishonored).

How do I go about creating an entirely new world from scratch? I just need a starting point.  




 Just looking for movies like Spielberg's 'Munich'. Political thrillers that revolve around assassination and spies.  




 I need to watch A Bittersweet life and Memories of Murder. Which should I watch first? 




 **5. Slaves With White Collars  How Advertising Affects Us**

Fight Club is one of those films thats layered like the proverbial onion, except instead of making you cry, it makes you think. One of the major provoking themes of the film is the desensitisation of a generation to our ancestral instincts  like gathering life-supporting resources and continuing our genetic line  and the replacement of these instincts with material and commercial items. Or in other words, working jobs we hate, so we can buy shit we dont need.
Both the book and film focus heavily on this, and in fact director David Fincher is quoted as saying that every scene of the film contains a Starbucks coffee cup. Essentially it points out how our hardwired needs are being exploited and replaced. Instead of having a bigger food pile than our fellow caveman, now we want the most expensive car, the swankier apartment and the designer clothes.
A key part of our evolution is mate selection, and much of this relies on cues of fitness. A landmark study by Buss (1989) suggests that males value reproductive capacity (waist to hip ratio, healthy hair, skin, youth etc) and females value resource acquisition (physically healthy and strong, wealth etc). The reason for this, of course, is that at the basic level the meaning of life is to reproduce and ensure the survival of ones offspring. If a partner is good-looking, this is a sign he/she is healthy and is more likely to be able to foster strong children. If a partner is wealthy there is more chance they can acquire greater resources and ensure the prosperity of the family.
Advertisers know that all this happens at a subconscious level, and they tap into it at will. How often do you see an advert for a perfume or aftershave featuring someone clinically obese, sitting in their clapped out Ford Fiesta telling you how good it smells? Never. Its always the young model with a Gucci dress or an Omega watch getting out of a Aston Martin, or pondering life upon some L A rooftop (whilst not mentioning what the hell it smells of), because thats what hits our evolutionary buttons and makes us want to have that life. The item for sale in half the adverts is irrelevant, its the lifestyle they are advertising.
Yet as cynical as we are, we all know this is a fairy tale. We know that if you buy that car youre not going to become a film star, but we do it anyway. Its this point Fight Club taps into so well, that the greatest trick the advertisers play is letting us think that we came up with the whole idea ourselves, and then making us pay for it.

**4. Youre Not A Beautiful And Unique Snowflake  You Have To Work For Something Meaningful**

Most of us felt it at some point, that we were somewhat special, that we could be just like the people in the music videos, the movies and the television shows. A simple flick through Saturday night prime time TV can show you how much everything is geared towards that flicker of fame, that taste of perceived success. When members of the public are giving hand jobs to farm yard animals (Rebecca Loos  The Farm) or masturbating with wine bottles live on tv for your viewing pleasure (Kinga Karolczak  UK Big Brother 6) you know something somewhere is wrong. As Tyler Durden says weve all been raised by television to believe that one day wed all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars, but we wont and were slowly learning that fact.. and were very very pissed off.
This is a point thats touched on a little more in the book than the film. In the book the narrator (Edward Nortons character) meets Tyler on a nude beach, where he watches him drag and place logs so that the shadow they cast looks like a giant hand, with Tyler sitting in the middle of the palm. With the changing position of the sun for one moment the hand is perfect. Tyler says that a person has to work hard for it, but one minute of perfection was worth the effort. That a moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection.
If we look at psychologist Abraham Maslows model, known as Maslows Hierarchy Of Needs, right at the top of the pyramid, what Maslow argues is the pinnacle of existence is self actualisation. As he writes in his 1954 paper, what a man can be, he must be. For the narrator, that is what Tyler represents, perfection. For a moment in time he is all he can be.
Now admittedly this meeting is far more symbolic in the book than the film, and I wouldnt necessarily say the books meeting is better. But what it shows is to achieve something meaningful to you, you have to work at it. Now Im not advising you start an underground cult and try to revert our civilisation back to year zero, but you know, maybe write something?

**3. Youre Not Your Fucking Khakis  We Are Not Defined By Our Possessions**

The line the things you used to own, now they own you is possibly one of my favourite in both the book and the film. It may be a very 60s vibe but the concept that we as consumers are more concerned with our possessions than our personalities strikes a particular cord. Think of the grandmother, religiously polishing the family silver they never use. I mean when was the last time you bought clothes purely for their physiological properties? If that were the case, rather than squeezing into an uncomfortable suit, we would all wear our pyjamas everywhere. Ok, I know many a student has taken a trip to the local supermarket in their Hello Kitty finest, but really, would you go to a job interview like that? Oh this, yeah, Spider-Man, whats the pension scheme like?
We buy cars and houses and before long we are working just to pay for our possessions. Then before you know it you wake up at 70 and youre retiring, wondering why you only have 10 years left (if youre lucky) to try and enjoy these nice things youve worked for.
Fight Club bases much of the apathy felt by the narrator on his relationship with his Ikea nest, defining himself by his hand crafted dishes and his Strinne green striped armchairs. But it was when he lost it all that he truly felt delivered. In his book, The Philosophy Of Ownership, Robert LeFevre talks of the history of the idea that an individuals virtue relies on not owning multiple possessions. In Platos Republic, the philosopher Socrates proposes a city in which there is no private property, with its citizens sharing everything. LeFevre also notes that Buddhism and Christianity also emphasise that possessions are a burden to achieving enlightenment.
Simply put nice things are, well, nice, but they shouldnt encompass who you are.

**2. Its Only After Weve Lost Everything That Were Free To Do Anything  Post-Traumatic Growth**

Although this one might be pretty hard to understand unless youve encountered a life-altering situation, the philosophy is sound. The idea that losing all hope is freedom can be seen in how attitudes and mind-sets change following a trauma. In the psychology world, (please take notes class) this is known as post traumatic growth. For example, a 2009 study by Crystal Park (and others) in the Journal of General and Internal Medicine found that 83% of cancer survivors reported a more positive identity.
Two of the leading writers on post-traumatic growth, Tedeschi   Calhoun note how often the attempt to understand human suffering appears in literary works, and therefore as a result in film. In Fight Club trauma and personal growth isnt a result, its the goal. In the book, the narrator says At the time, my life just seemed too complete, and maybe we have to break everything to make something better of ourselves. The narrator creates Tyler to help him change his boring and unfulfilled life, and the only way he could see this creation was through self-destruction.
The difficulty in learning from this philosophy lies in the ability to grasp this new appreciation of the world without having to, you know, nearly die. But the answer could lie with being able to understand the everyday trauma around us. Harness the appreciation and understanding that even if we are not happy with our lives, we are lucky enough to have the chance to change it.

**1. The Ability To Let That Which Does Not Matter, Truly Slide  Dont Sweat The Little Things**

Ok, so were all guilty of this one. No-one can ever really say that nothing gets to them. And sure, its ok to shit yourself when your house is on fire, or you get into a car accident. But whether or not your T-shirt goes with that pair of jeans, or if youre getting too many wrinkles? None of this REALLY matters. In the grand scheme of things, when youre on your death bed, and they ask you what do you regret, no-one is going to say I wish I had chosen the blue sofa instead of the green.
Worry, in an evolutionary perspective, is a good thing. For example, its good to worry about looking as you cross the road, because if you dont youre likely to get hit by a car. However ,excessive worrying  dubbed by psychiatrist Edward Hallowell as toxic worry  mainly focuses on the what if rather than the what is. In an excessive form this kind of worry can sometimes be classed as generalised anxiety disorder, where the worry is disproportionate to the actual problem.
Its this kind of worry and stress that actually makes solving the problem harder, because the brain cant focus on the solution. Its a case of not being able to see the wood for the trees, and if you spend all your energy on worrying about the problem, you cant work out the solution.
In Fight Club the narrator says After a night in fight club, everything in the real world gets the volume turned down. Having gone through a fight (something that would get most peoples attention) the things the narrator used to irrationally worry about, didnt seem as important any more. He realised that most stress and worry is a self created state, and by having something real to contrast it with, hes able to let the rest slide.
 
So there you have it, 5 philosophies neatly extracted from Fight Club. How does the story make you feel and what did you take away from it? Post your comments below, and remember, in Tyler we trust

I totally just broke the 1st and 2nd rules. Is the right sub to post this to? 




 Is the Lone Ranger any good? I've heard some good and some bad about it and I just want /r/movies' opinion on the film, should I watch it? 









 What is that from? Please tell. 









 I actually think they're hilarious. 









 Nice catch OP. Looks like they didn't want to give away what that green thing is until the last trailer.  









 This went through development hell apparently. Let's hope it turns out well. 




 Birdman 









 I really think he does not get enough recognition for how much of a talented actor he is. Ever since I saw him in 'Drive' (2011) I thought to myself that his career is going places. And now look, he's starring in one of the biggest upcoming films of all time, Star Wars The Force Awakens, and he's also starring in one of the biggest blockbusters of next year, X-men: Apocalypse. But what I like the most is how he's still doing smaller films as well. Just this year he stared in 'A Most Violent Year' along with Jessica Chastain and just recently he was in 'Ex Machina' (which I just saw) which as already made a spot in my top 10 of 2015. He's also set to star in a HBO Miniseries, 'Show me a hero'. Obviously when Star Wars and X-Men come out he'll receive a lot more attention and recognition from people but, IMO, up until this point I think he's quite an under appreciated actor. What do you guys think of him? What's your favorite of his? 









 Being an Aussie and can say that Jai Courtney's accent is spot on. 




 It.  




 IT and The Stand. His two best.  




 /r/imgoingtohellforthis 




 Why was Batman fighting soldiers with Superman symbols on their arms while in a desert while a weird (but still cool) bat suit? 




 For me, the story of Dishonored starts and ends with Corvo Attano. I need to get my head around this guy. It's his story, so I'll playing as Emily in my second playthrough, and Corvo on my first. 




 I know I fucked it. 




 Is Soloman Kane worth it? 




 The IT remake. Will Poulter would've made a great Pennywise. 














 This new trailer gives me hope for the DCCU. I watched a leaked version of the Suicide Squad trailer and that doesn't look too bad either. Also, I have faith in Snyder to make a solid Justice League movie(s), he proved he can handle an ensemble cast of characters well in Watchmen, IMO. 




 What the fuck even is Ant-Man? 




 Always love Bryan Singer's movies, he's a little underrated IMO. 




 I thought Superman burns his hair off? That's guaranteed brain cancer right there.  




 What does he mean by that? 




 Some people find him underrated, some people find him overrated. What are your thoughts of the guy as an actor? What's your favorite of his? 




 The books have been sitting on my shelf for years now. I think it's about time I get them out, blow the dust off and start reading. 




 The ending of One Flew over the Cuckoos nest. The music, the acting.  did NOT see it coming.

Also the ending to Zodiac left me with an emotion I didn't know I even had. It made me feel eerie and a little dirty inside. The victim pointing out that he is absolutely sure that that man was the Zodiac killer was just such a powerful scene followed that song and the aftermath of the case. 









 This looks fucking groovy as hell. 




 I'm loving the practical effects. 




 I'm loving all the practical effects. 




 [Here's some more footage of the bobbit worm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpD8jWvYEHI) 




 I should fucking kill you, /u/IAMNOTACANOPENER. 




 Someone needs to post the ending to 'Dr Zhivago'. Nothing short of amazing. He was one of Hollywood's golden actors, may he rest in peace. 




 Rest in peace Mr Sharif.  




 Imagine sticking your finger across it. 




 I enjoyed it. 




 It's considered the weakest of the trilogy for sure but it's not hated. I like it. 




 Please sabotage other movies. 




 I am a HUGE Pink Floyd fan, and I can't believe I haven't heard of this.

 




 Not such a good choice in my opinion. Although Jurassic World wasn't perfect, I think the flaws came from the story and writing rather than the directing however I don't think Trevorrow is experienced enough (just judging from his [filmography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Trevorrow) here) to direct a Star Wars film, let alone the the last of the new trilogy. I am very confident that Abrams and Johnson will do a solid if not excellent job directing Episodes 7   8, and I think having Trevorrow direct Episode 9 could result in a bit of a disappointment. But who knows, I could be wrong.  














 Waters? Barrett? Who? 




 And Aaron Eckhart KEPT ACTING!!!!! 




 You may want to remove this, before [they](https://www.reddit.com/r/moviescirclejerk/) see it. 




 The Last of Us has the most cinematic cut scenes I've ever seen. 









 Love how they are keeping faithful to Miller's The Dark Knight Returns. I love how it's worn and scratched, like he's been using it for a while. But does anyone know if Batman has ever used the armored suit other than [TDKR spoilers](#s "beating Superman within an inch of his life?") 









 I am pleasantly surprised. I was one of the guys who thought this was going to be Marvel's first MAJOR fuck up. Maybe not then. 




 [Hold out your hand, OP.](http://i.imgur.com/yAalTE9.gif) 




 For example, if you are crying, a dog will most likely come up to you and start licking your face or perhaps do something to comfort you. Or if you are angry at your dog he will perhaps curl up into a ball and look up at his master with shameful eyes. Can someone please explain in depth why dogs can pick that sort of thing up from humans? Thanks.

edit: *Why can dogs, not how. My bad. 




 Was waiting to see if someone would post this. Thank you, that is one of my favorite songs. 









 I like to say "not if you want to keep your spleen" from American Psycho.

I'm a cold bastard I know. 




 Didn't even know this was happening. I'm a huge SK fan I have the book but I am yet to read it. 




 Good on them. 









 Bring me that sequel. 



















 Aussie here, you're damn right. 




 This reminds me of 'Ed Wood'. If you haven't seen it, watch it. It's about the worst film director of all time. Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood and Martin Landau plays Bela Lugosi, he won an oscar for it. Also, it's directed by Tim Burton. Great movie. 




 Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Gangs of New York, Casino, Shutter Island, The Aviator.
