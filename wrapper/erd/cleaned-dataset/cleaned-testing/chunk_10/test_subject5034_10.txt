 Obama was far from a front runner in 2008. The right discourse and enough momentum can make new front runners. 




 I got a Breton Motif. 4k gold.  Anyone interested pm me, ps4-NA 




 It is the Supreme Court's responsibility to protect minority rights from legislation which oppresses said rights. They now set precedent to avoid anymore legislation which would infringe on gay rights. This is exactly where this should have been decided. Just like it was the right place to resolve segregation and the infringement of African American rights. That is the whole purpose of Judicial Review. To prevent oppressive legislation by the majority. Good job SCOTUS! 




 I live in Wisconsin and happen to be a Vikings fan. Like to know the discourse of my rivals. Specifically when everyone near me is a Packer fan. Gonna be talked about all around me. Might as well be up to date. 




 Not saying the Vikings had a solid defense in that game. But an offense without Peterson and with Ponder sucks. It's inefficient (time of possession) and has turnovers. That makes success for the defense incredibly difficult.  









 It failed? That's funny. It sure didn't seem like it failed with groups of  9th graders singing this "obsolete" song throughout the day. But hell, you must have been there, not me. Since you seem so positive it failed. 









 Yikes. That is a whole lot of broad generalization about a whole country of people from one ignorant comment.  That certainly can't enhance any sort of conversation.  




 I listen using the Podcast Addict ap on my phone.  Super reliable and easy. Tons and tons of podcasts 




 Yeah.  I thought I remember him saying in part V that he was going to do one on the Peloponnesian War.  Obviously didn't say it would be next, but did mention he wants to do it. 




 Sproles is much older and certainly did not look better than Shady last year. That Shefter tweet about McCoy being 2nd in NFL in rushing behind Demarco weeks 5-17 last year proves that. He had a slow start, but is still a dominant back.

With that said, I still think the Eagles are the winners by being able to shed that cap hit and getting a potential stud in Alonso. 




 These are all over actually. Around both Madison as well as Milwaukee.

 I'll live with the post karma trumping my comment karma in this case. People disagree with me. I can live with that 




 Are you implying he shouldn't have been charged with a crime? Pretty sure that selling a fake illegal substance is illegal in every state. And if you are dumb enough to try and sell pop tarts as crack you should go to idiot jail anyway.

Edit: Really can't believe this comment is getting this much hate. The guy broke a law and was arrested. Pretty much all I said.
