 Dude, he said he wasn't racist. 




 So you're telling me there's a chance? 









 Woo I'm special. 268 to 175 (5'-11.75" male) between January 2013 and today. Was at 180 a year ago, been maintaining for a while. 




 You're a fact over fiction person yet you are sitting here telling us a story about how you are convinced something you saw was evil without any facts to back it up. It sounds to me like you're turning your personal fiction into personal fact.  









 If I was the boss I wouldn't just walk away. I'd be a boss and tear them a new asshole.  




 Going to minimum security white color prison for insider trading is not hardcore. She taught art classes to fellow inmates.  




 He's an anti-vaxer, or at least vocally supports his wife on the issue.  




 Implying buying furniture that looks good, fits with your apartment wa, is arranged neatly and is kept clean doesn't take effort? They're all parts of a whole. Maintaining a space you can be comfortable in, and confident others will be comfortable in, requires effort on all fronts. A clean bathroom with an imbalance of messy living area will be off-putting; similarly, a nice living room with a dirty bathroom, kitchen, etc., will be off-putting. 




 Do you need someone who can potentially prescribe medication or would a LCWS work? 




 Show almost lost me with the opening sequence. Found his belching almost unbearable.  




 It's funny because I almost turned it off during the opening sequence due to Rick's uncontrollable belching. So glad I didn't, I knew it was going to be one of my favorites when Rick says, "it was a figure of speech Morty. They're bureaucrats, I don't respect them." 




 Taken ~2 hours apart. 




 Hit up Double Trouble. It's right by the Ensemble/HCC stop.  




 All the people aren't in North Texas though. Dallas/FW only has ~500,000 more people than Houston, and outside of those cities, North Texas is pretty sparsely populated. 

But I guess, good job on having a marginally higher population than the second most populated metro area in your state, I guess?

PS Houston has more people than Dallas.

sort by population descending, majority of the top 10 counties are not in north texas, including #1. 




 context 




 no but if the post title was "Standing ovation from OA crowd as Harden walks off floor. #classyfans", I would use my brain to complete the context and not have this issue that you are seemingly having. 




 Since context? 




 lololol!!! :D 




 What did you say you little bitch? I have half a mind to make it my life's mission eat you with BBQ sauce, over and over, forever.   Ball chinned  monkey fellatier 




 So is playing defense so you don't put yourself into a position where you have to exploit the system to work your way back into the game.  




 It was humbling. I think I came out of the whole thing a better man  




 Just gotta have a short memory about it and start the steak anew.  




 That's funny cuz I pissed myself for the first time in 20+ years this weekend. Lol.  




 Rockets aren't even gonna show up, that's how fucked they are.  




 We'll get over it. At least we still have other fans making predictions about us :p 




 also, is your name a play off the way that congressman from Brooklyn pronounced Houston when he was talking shit about how we were complaining we didn't get one of the space shuttles? 




 sorry, Austin. 




 there is a lit mustard yellow and lit ketchup red zippo. see middle right, under 'believe it again'.

next iteration will have pyrotechnics and human sacrifice, no worries. 




 they're both large 




 Austin Rivers played like Austin Rivers thinks Austin Rivers plays. 




 It's not coming down. 




 I have two. The shirt on the right that says "don't tell me this town aint got no heart" is the back.

They don't fit me anymore, would you like one? 




 haha. 









 Whatever you did last time, keep doing it ;) 




 a fucking great one 




 I never said it was just don't act like you fucking know beyond a shadow of a doubt that McHale was never on the hot seat you dork. 




 but that doesn't mean you can stop doing it 




 lol 




 jesus dude, stop acting like you know the inner dealings of the houston rocket's internal organization. 




 I mean, don't act like it would have been out of the question. Anything is possible these days with the way NBA front offices act. Definitely don't disagree with the stuff after your first sentence, but I mean, c'mon, you're not like, super privy to 'the situation' compared to the rest of us.

Make me a list previously fired coaches whom "had great relationships with the FO" and "were respected around the league" and I'll give you a list of examples of why I'm right. 




 dawg you're like steph curry shootin airball in game 3. i'm sure you mvp, but sometimes you gotta admit you fuckin whiffed.  




 welcome to me after every rockets loss. "on second thought, /r/nba seems like a silly place" 




 yeah what a dick, kind of. 




 Barristan dying means Daario is taking over his role, while Wormtongue and Mellisande are taking over the love angle. Dany hasn't shown much love interest towards DarDar this season, has she? Maybe I missed it in all the non-sequiturs.  




 right the narrative fits after game 5. after game 6 they're not staying alive, they're in control.  




 I get that they had to win game 6 to stay alive. Winning game 6 resets the narrative though, right? 

Like, after the Battle of Kursk, were the radios going like "***beep beep beep*** - soviets avoid destruction ***beep boop*** absolutely cripple german offensive capabilities, ***beep borp*** soviet union hangs but by a pulse."? 




 huge run in the rockets favor? 




 not sure it counts but i called Jsmoove winning us this game, and called him winning us games throughout the playoffs. Not sure if it counts for my ego but it def counts for the FUCKING SCOREBOARD. 




 If he's not inconsistent, does that means you're scared he'll do the same thing he's done every game so far? Or you're scared his consistency will catch up to him and he'll have an uncharacteristically bad game? Or you're scared for the Rockets because he'll have an uncharacteristically good game (compared to his consistently elite playoffs so far) 




 assonance assisted autoassasination. 




 I'm positive that there's no way you can actually be positive about that assertion. Unless you are Bill Simmons. Which is silly considering - - wait. SN17 ... SN = Simmo**NS** backwards; 17 = B**IL**L flipped and individually mirrored in place.

nah. that's stupid. i'm stupid.
  




 He'll also smile a lot. His smile will look 99% genuine, but something's off. 




 haha i'm pretty sure i wasn't trying to put him under fire. he was, at the worst, polite. the clue in my comment was where i said "i don't know what i expected exactly but it involved more of us becoming best friends". 




 I don't own a car. By 'our car' I was referring to the cars with which we were waiting to get into to transport ourselves home. 




 I don't remember, I was pretty drunk. 




 I talked to Arian last night after the Rocket's game while we were waiting for our cars in the blue lot below the Toyota Center. Well, 'talked to him' is a bit generous. I talked at him. Told him his kicks were fresh but mine were fresher. He just kinda looked at me for a second, rolled his eyes and goes, "yeah man, they are. they are...", got into his car which had just pulled up and bounced.

Not sure what I expected exactly, but it definitely involved more of us becoming best friends. 




 hate-bros for life 




 Yeah but the Thunder have Sam Presti! 




 1 out of 5 ain't bad! 




 It's not new. It started when we got Harden, picked up steam when we got Howard, and hit it's full stride when we let our Big-3 walk this past off season.

The first 2 years I was on /r/nba, the Rockets were everyone's second favorite team. It's been interesting watching the transformation from loved to hated. 




 we don't fly. we fart, with style. 




 My last name is Ainsworth so fuck this.  




 hilarious 




 so he just didn't give a shit because your team sucks. whatever. 




 except not at all. water boarding is much different and is basically just having buckets of water poured over your head to imitate drowning. 




 It's because they're an easy organization to use as a bartering chip. Mark Cuban wants them, other teams know that, so if you show interest in joining the Mavs, the other teams have to worry about Cuban throwing money, so if you want them you gotta throw more.  




 You're not a desired landing spot. See: last 10 FA periods.  




 Probably because of all the wild horse missions? 




 Smith is the kind of guy who needs boundaries, structure and supervision to succeed. When he went to Detroit, he went into an environment where he was given almost free reign over himself. It was easy to look at him in that situation and think, "well, here's a horse who can never be tamed, who does what he wants, who doesn't care where his hoofs land."

Yes, Smith is a wild stallion at heart; and all wild stallions can be tamed, though not everyone can tame one.

The Rockets were in the perfect situation to tame him, to put a saddle on him, and to man the reins.

For Smith to reign supreme, he needs the reins of a *team*.    




 Everyone wants to play with Parsons doe 




 My reasoning for preferring the Spurs is pragmatic: no 930 tip offs.  




 right... there's one alleged case of an orca killing a human and it's from 1894. 




 Pretty sure he means it leads to the orca's tragic death. I don't believe there is any record of a wild orca killing a human.  




 but...he played more games than Kawhi? 




 Dawg, no one is "shutting down" high quality sound compression.   




 he conceivably had the chance when we signed howard 2 summers ago but took the money in detroit (read: played the long con) 




 he's causing the Rockets to lose 

this is why you don't talk before the kibble is dry 




 lack of depth? 




 Uhh have you ever seen predatory birds? Forward set eyes make sense for land predators but not aerial predators. 



 




 Hold up, you take those other phrases seriously?  




 I just walk around them with purpose, make direct eye contact with one of them and give a really fucking dissaproving glare like "yo I'll move for you cuz I'm the one that's aware of reality but pay the fuck attention to your surroundings you dopes" 




 I'm fit, walk everywhere, average about 8 miles a day, but live in a humid and hot city and SWEAT LIKE A MOTHER if the temperature is above 75. Distance I can walk without sweating decreases as the temp increases. Used to make me self conscious but now I'm just like "Wasup im glistnin" 




 "We'll use our aircraft carriers to completely decimate their battleship fleet because battleships are the most lethal weapons on water and we'll destroy them with our aircraft carriers with no direct support from out battleships in the engagement and while Americs carrier fleet isn't at harbor that doesn't matter because we're about to destroy their battleships which are the best possible naval weapons with just our carriers which are merely support ships..."

 




 i mean, yeah. it's a bigger number. it's a big number. i don't think it represents a bigger impact on the game than boogie's night. i just think that at the end of the day, 50 is flashier and more noticeable to the average person.

i mean, this thread has 260 comment versus 66 in the Cousin's stat line thread. kinda speaks for itself.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7RjuwG6Esw

carl landry will forever be my favorite rocket. i think that year was my favorite/most memorable season of rockets basketball to date. 




 right it's super impressive. hakeem holds the league record in 5x5s so i respect the hell out of that stat line. just saying 50 is flashier; not better, flashier.  




 yeah can i get a large slice of prigioni pizza? 




 on feb. 11th he had a 9 point game shooting 3-12 FG and missing all 8 3PA. 2 50 PT games, 3 40 pt games, 6 30 point games, 2 15 point games a 17 point game 2 18 point games and the rest 20 point games. as many 40+ games as -20 pt games, so he makes up for the duds. 




 I somewhat agree, however Harden also had 8rb/6a/3stl. I think they're both equally impressive individual performances but 51 points is simply flashier. Boogie had a monster game though, he looked like a superstar.  




 Across the board, I wouldnt Curry's numbers are head and shoulders above Westbrook or Harden's. They all are posting MVP caliber seasons purely from a statistical standpoint and they all make worthy candidates.

 I think at the end of the season, the votes are going to come down more to "what they think they did with what" - do they prefer Harden leading a challenge for the SW division title and 2nd seed with an extreme dearth of normal starter minutes logged; Westbrook with triple doubles left and right, a nasty bark and nastier bite and a taste for upset on his tongue; or Curry, putting up one of the most beautifully efficient exhibitions of guard play in ages, on one of the most dominant and successful teams the regular season has witnessed?

I think it's gonna be very close, with Harden or Curry taking it home.  




 I get the egg white one and add an extra egg white for a buck.   




 Dude...we missed the playoffs for 4 straight seasons after the departure of both TMac and Yao...  




 because he's un-guardable and people are forced to foul him. 




 you are in the sw division, you are our division rival. if you are in the same division as someone, they are your division rival. we're not talking about BIGGEST RIVAL, just division rival. get it?  




 It confuses me that the attitude towards Harden isn't the attitude that is expressed towards Westbrook; they even take the same amount of FTA per game (never hear his FTA mentioned). Harden is just a silly, fun loving guy while Westbrook is the kind of guy you don't want to invite to happy hour.  




 Which is cool because I liked when he was playing. Doesn't put up numbers but is an actual PG. 




 Curious now what the average length of a Rockets game is vs. other teams. Can't be that substantial and Harden is a quick FT taker. I mean, the Rockets average 25 FT (4th in the league) and only take 6 more FT per game than the lowest FTA team (Knicks at 19) - so there isn't much of a spread in FTA between teams. 6 FTs take, what, an extra 3 minutes of game time? Max? 




   of drawing charges. I'd rather them improve their defensive skill than their drawing charges skill.

Averages .2 FTA fewer than Harden on 4 more MPG. 




 "Stop forcing our defense to foul you or give up a layup." 




 Messed up bruh, should have said this in the thread about Harden having 5 games with more FTA than the other team.  




  Total bitch made bro. It must be scary to live in a world where the only viable response to a differing opinion is a silent, yet visible dismissal or "that's bitchmade". 

Keep it trill, /r/NBA.
