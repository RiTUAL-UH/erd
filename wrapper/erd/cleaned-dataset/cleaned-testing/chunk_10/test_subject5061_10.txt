 I wonder if they will use those licenses to vote in the next election? 




 You should read the police blotter or court docket on any local newspaper online and see just how many illegal aliens drive drunk, drive without a registered or insured car and get into deadly accidents. No joke, it seems as if 50-75% of those crimes are committed by illegal aliens. Don't take my word for it, just see for yourself.  




 It seems once a year I read a new story of some guy mowing his lawn and falling into a collapsed septic tank and dying. Given the fumes and the consistency of liquified shit I bet dying that way is more common than most people realize.

 What about the US Constitution? 
























 If someone wants a gun and is willing to obtain it illegally, they will obtain one. Just look at Chicago, 16 year olds have all the guns they need. Laws only restrict the law abiding. 

You also must remember the 2nd amendment to the US constitution. The restrictions you mention are not enumerated by the Constitution. A few restrictions have been allowed but they are almost entirely as a result of John Dillinger and other prohibition era gangsters and the 1968 gun act. Further restrictions will be resisted by those, including myself, who view them as a violation of constitutional law. If you want to have guns restricted then you must change the constitution first. The constitution specifically ensured the people would be armed to act as a check and balance against government oppression and allow the people to revolt if necessary.  As a result, most gun owners  are against giving up their guns or restricting their ownership based on our natural rights 

 




 The Left has a long history of never being satisfied with half measure when it comes to ideological issues. As a result, any limited measures of gun control are only stepping stones in an incremental quest for a  total ban over private gun ownership. 

I simply don't believe that the Left will quit after a few gun control measures are passed. Wide-scale gun registration or gun permitting schemes would be used to identify gun owners to be used to aid future gun confiscation by government.

 Ill have those niggers voting Democratic for the next 200 years. Lyndon B. Johnson to two governors on Air Force One 




 We both agree that the Democrat Party renounced overt racism after a century of vile racist policies. 

There is no proof that the GOP as a result decided to embrace racism.

The Southern Strategy is based on a single interview by Lee Atwater in which he stated that the GOP was focusing on economic issues to attract disenchanted Southern Democrat voters who felt the Democrat Party had moved too far to the Left. Atwater stated that it was economics issues and not appeals to "nigger nigger" that would attract those Dixiecrat voters.

The movement of Southern Democrat voters to the GOP was not a sudden event as the result of the 1964 Civil Rights act. The migration was a slow transition that last over 40 years.

No party would embrace racism. Why do you think the Democrats renounced it in 1964? Because racists are a small voting block compared to all voters. It would be tantamount to a political party embracing molesters as a voting block. The upside would be minute and the downside to a party would be enormous. 

 




 This Obama policy came to light just yesterday. It is a plan to take away guns from Social Security recipients. This shows how the Left thinks about gun control and ultimately outlawing private gun ownership

http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/18/obamas-secretive-gun-ban-for-social-security-beneficiaries/ 




 The Republican Party has a long and sordid present of overt racism.

Oh really? care to share your proof with the rest of us?  




 Do you honestly believe that the Left will reach a point of a few gun control measures and then never agitate for further gun controls? 
The Left has an ideology based agenda. Half measures are not acceptable.  The Left will never stop until private gun ownership is ended 




 Unfortunately, the Left will never stop at any new gun control measure. After one regulation is achieved then they will move on agitating for the next regulation. This endless push for greater gun control regulations will never end until all firearms are removed from the hands of private citizens.  




 Republicans and Conservatives have never been the same. The GOP is made up of several factions including RINOs, Conservatives, Religious Right, Libertarians, and establishment DC elitists to name a few.

It is true that Republicans have a long history of opposing slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation. The Democrat Party meanwhile has a long and sordid history of overt racism. 




 The lesson every country should learn about Germany and the Nazis is to never allow socialists in office ever again.  









 Obama has done much worse things as president. He could literally commit murder and the Dems would not impeach him or force him to resign.

 OMalley booed off stage at Netroots Nation after saying all lives matter and white lives matter.

Is anyone else concerned about this? Do all lives matter or just certain ones? 




 You claimed that the GOP is racist. Where is your proof? I guess they don't teach critical thinking in high school anymore.   

  




 Being a political Conservative is not the same as an environmental conservative. Being a political Conservative involves such things as favoring limited government and personal freedom. TR was certainly not in favor of those things  




 Maybe not a lateral political selection such as Sharpton. Is it too much to ask that only Conservatives be  pictured? Do we need to pollute every aspect of our culture with the cancer of Leftism? 




 Do you even know what the so called Southern Strategy was? You make the assumption that Lee Atwater's comments regarding the GOP focusing on economic issues and not "N*gger n*gger" is somehow  proof that ever since the GOP has embraced racist policies, racist candidates, and racist voters? If that is your "proof" then you really need to earn your GED. 




 He can still buy candy with pennies. Dad's beer purchases require dollars 




 Sorry but his Progressive views were in no way Conservative. Call it anything you like but he was a Progressive and a Collectivist. You are splitting hairs by denying his Leftist leanings   




 Any proof of that? I realize the Democrats renounced racism then but there is no proof that the GOP embraced it as a result. It is people like you who lie that makes the political climate in this country impossible. Shame on you 




 He was a Progressive and a collectivist. Is there any difference? 




 Where do you get your silly ideas about the GOP being racist? Did you know that the Democrat Party opposed the Civil Rights act, opposed integration, formed the KKK, enforced Jim Crow laws, poll taxes, oh and favored slavery?  




 When one considers that Conservatism and Socialism are diametrically opposed political concepts then I am super indignant. Imagine if a subredditt called Progressives_R_Us had a picture of Ted Cruz on its masthead.  




 The Democrat Party supported slavery, supported segregation, started the KKK, initiated Jim Crow laws, poll taxes, opposed integration and the Civil Rights Act.

Where did you get your GED? 




 Take the money and refill with pennies and nickles. A three year old won't know the difference 









 It is an insult to Conservative's intelligence 





























 Anything would be better than it is today under the current regime. 










































































 You need to go back to school my friend. Naziism, as well as Fascism, were socialist movements. Hitler opposed Communists because he considered them as too internationally focused and too Jewish. He also viewed them as competition. The Nazis were the National Socialist Workers Party. Hitler was a prolific socialist writer and philosopher.  

He came up with the idea for national socialism by combining the key elements of socialism such as government (or community) control over the means of production and a government centric society at the expense of personal liberty with  elements of nationalism. 

Control over the means of production and distribution does not necessarily mean government owns an industry. It can also mean the government (or community) controls privately held industry.

  




 Hitler was a socialist. Is the author suggesting Walker is a socialist too?  

















































 Owning guns and giving info to Google is unacceptable in my book.  





























 Thanks to Ellen Pao, Asian-Americans will no longer be saddled with the insidious stereotype of being bright, hardworking and competent. 




  then you need a history book. They are completely opposite of what they were in the past.

I have a degree in US History and I don't remember the part where the Republicans became racists. Are you sure you are not simply repeating a Liberal fantasy? 




 So what you are saying is one speaker, made one statement, that was taken out of context, and that imputes  every Conservative as being racists?

You do realize that the Democrat Party favored slavery, started the KKK, initiated Jim Crow laws, favored segregation, and opposed the Civil Rights Act?

You have to be trolling me because even someone with a GED would know these things.

 




 Racism Hate Bigotry

Have any proof of that? 

We can never solve our differences if people cling to false dehumanizing characterizations.  














 Uranus Attacks! 




 To be honest though, being Australian, those events probably would have happened to him anyway.  




 As with all things Leftist, it is not about the people but about the power.  












































 Why can't you answer my questions? Maybe you are a fraud and a silly troll? 









 It used examples from as far back as 1967! Reagan evolved from a Hollywood Liberal into a Conservative. His support for amnesty was a failure and proves that we can't have another round of amnesty for illegal aliens until the border is sealed don't you agree?

My original comment was that JFK would be rejected by today's Democrat Party because it has moved so far to the Left. Do you agree? 




 Sorry but Reagan was a true Conservative.

 http://www.theblaze.com/blog/2014/03/03/the-11-principles-of-a-reagan-conservative/

He was not perfect but he was infinitely  better than  today's RINO GOP candidates. 

crooksandliars is your source?????really????? 




 You are totally wrong.  I am a hard core Tea Party member and i would vote for Reagan today. You can either believe a lie you have been told or you can believe a fact coming from a direct source.  Being a Leftist i know you will choose your religion over fact 









 McCain is a RINO, Jeb Bush is a RINO. Reagan was a true Conservative who was a Liberal in Hollywood but his views evolved. One can't simply take his earlier views and try to play gotcha. I am telling you with all sincerity that Reagan would be embraced by the Tea Party today. The Left lies by claiming that the Tea Party is extreme but in reality, the Tea Party is simply garden variety, historical Conservatism.  The Left also lies by claiming the Tea Party is racist but they NEVER provide any proof of that lie.  




 Black and white fact. Doubt it if wish 














 It is dismaying that much of science is becoming a captive of politics. Maybe it has always been that way.  


































 See, you prove my point. Please get your GED and then come back to r/politics and at least try to make an honest, factual argument. What r/politics doesn't need is just another high school drop out shooting off his mouth with juvenile attempts at snark. 

Snark is an art and you are just finger painting 




 Totally wrong. As a hard core Tea Party member, I do not agree with every policy Reagan proposed but I agree with the vast majority of his policies. The Democrat Party of today would reject JFK almost entirely as being not far left enough.  




 It's sad how JFK would be totally rejected by today's far Left Democrat Party.  




 Name calling does not come easily to me but accurately describing some lame user's comments does. Have you ever made an educated or insightful  comment on r/politics? 





























 uneducated, rude, and unoriginal is no way to go through life. Did you ever wonder why people really don't like you? 




 They could have said that the mod in question and the admins had philosophical  differences in their vision of the subredit. They tried to come together but they couldn't. That type of statement would not expose anyone to legal liability.

The mod that was fired was almost certainly an at will employee, meaning she could be fired for any reason or no reason at all.  




 The facts surrounding her firing are few. That type of situation results in many conspiracy theories. The official reasons given are obviously not true. I don't know why they just don't tell us the truth 




 That is very interesting and very believable  




 OK thanks. The money talk just seemed random and vague to be brought up there. They discussed no other issues that they were concerned about  




  Why was the subject of money changing hands brought up there? Seems odd that such a random problem for that subreddit would be brought up then and there 




 It seemed vague to me. I can see your point. Thanks for your input.  




 I don't understand the term soap-boxing. I am not trying to say or promote any point of view. I am only trying to understand the statement made explaining this situation. I admit I could have read something into the statement that is not there.   




 I asked a question and now you are asking me the same question. Are you from New Jersey? 




  Imagine if they did that to a group of black reporters. I bet everyone would have such a big laugh

 




 That post says exactly the opposite of what you said.

FYI: asking a question is just that, asking a question. I was not making any kind of statement. Please read with more comprehension. Thanks 




 My original askreddit was rejected. I used terms such as the name of the mod in question and the subreddit involved.  




 But are they suggesting money changing hands is a problem for that subreddit? 




 "We have taken the day to try to understand how Reddit will seek to replace Victoria, and have unfortunately come to the conclusion that they do not have a plan that we can put our trust in. The admins have refused to provide essential information about arranging and scheduling AMAs with their new 'team.' This does not bode well for future communication between us, and we cannot be sure that everything is being arranged honestly and in accordance with our rules. The information we have requested is essential to ensure that money is not changing hands at any point in the procedure which is necessary for /r/IAmA to remain equal and egalitarian."

 I suggest you get your GED or take some classes at a community college near you. Political discussions are so much more enjoyable when you are educated and can grasp what is being discussed and actually add something to the discussion other than lame attempts at humor. 

BTW regarding your username, Hobbes was a philosopher and not just a stuffed tiger from the comics.  

Good luck 




 Just because my viewpoints differ from you does not mean I am stupid. Personally I respect others' opinions. It's sad that you feel threatened by diversity.  




 Huh? Are you commenting on the right post? This is reddit r/politics. 




 Perhaps you should MYOB. Perhaps you should try it. 




 Imagine if they did that to a group of black reporters. I bet everyone would have such a big laugh 




 Funny how Liberals NEVER seem to add anything to a serious political discussion except very lame snark. I bet if you were educated or at least politically astute you would have added something meaningful to the discussion. Sadly you were unable. Ha ha but at least you were funny.... not.... 




 Literally a hundred other redditors have made that exact same comment. If you can't be funny, interesting, or enlightening, at least you could be original. You must be such a hit with the ladies! 




 Hey, remember the last time the mainstream press wrote a negative story about Obama? Nah me neither. 

  




 Imagine what your reaction will be when president Cruz does the same thing to the press.  




 The mainstream media embargoes such negative stories on Ms.  Clinton. 

Using actual photographic proof prevents Ms Clinton's spin machine from denying such events ever took place.  









 You are delusional. Someone is raping these women. Again, if it is not Mexicans then who is doing the raping?

I am sorry that the facts here do not follow your narrative of how reality is supposed to be. Sometimes people like Trump speak the truth and he is not motivated by racism. Regardless, those on the Left can never even consider such realities. There is only the narrative that white males are racists who are motivated by nothing else. 

What a sad little rigid, closed worldview you have.   
















































































































































 Who is doing the raping of 80% of the women and girls trekking to the US from Mexico and Central America? Is it white American police? Is it college frat boys? 

Mexicans, whether they be illegal aliens, coyotes, police officials are the ones doing the raping. 

But by and large, when they arrive in the US, they do not become criminals.

By entering the country illegally they are criminals as soon as they cross over the border. Granted most are not going on and committing further crimes but a disturbing percentage are and most are going on public assistance as soon as they arrive here which is a violation of welfare statutes.  




 12 million. That policy was supposed to solve the illegal immigration crisis. All it accomplished was to make 12 million illegal aliens citizens and opened the door for tens of millions more that we are discussing today. If we do not close the borders then once the illegals here now are legitimized then a new crop of millions more will come across the border. The cycle will never end 




 ALL of the other candidates are milquetoast politicians who say nothing but lame platitudes and vague policies. Bernie Sanders is different in that he offers specific (yet tired and historically failed) socialist policies. Scott Walker and Ted Cruz are offering interesting solutions but too many Conservatives have promised to give DC an enema but end up becoming seduced by power and cash. 

Who do you believe is stating anything substantive that has not been processed through the politically correct, focus group, mush machine? 




 Did you know that 25% of Mexico's citizens currently reside in the USA? 25%!!!!!!!!!

How can anyone claim that there is a zero net increase in the two countries' populations?

I would also like to add that the vast majority of Americans living in Mexico are wealthy or at least self supporting. No one is claiming the same for Mexican nationals living in the US. 




 "Rape can be perpetrated by anyone along the way, including guides, fellow migrants, bandits or government officials, according to Fusion."

Clearly the rapists are not limited to coyotes.  




 This adds nothing substantive to the claim of illegal immigrants being rapists.

Except that the article I offered gave proof that the 80% figure was accurate. BTW the article was published in Fusion which is owned by Spanish language broadcaster Univision.  




  Most of the route consisted of Mexico so most happened in Mexico we can assume.

Who lives in Mexico? Mexicans

Trump said that the illegal aliens who are streaming across the border are not Mexico and Central America's best and brightest. Many are drug dealers, gang members, rapists, and welfare recipients. Can you refute those claims? He did not say that every Mexican was a rapist. 




 80% of illegal alien women trekking to the US are raped. All Trump did was state this fact.

Who is doing the raping then?

BTW, Obama called illegal aliens gang bangers on Wednesday.

Video proof:

  Please read this explanation of the wide spread rape of illegal alien women coming across the border. Who is doing the raping then? White cops? UVA frat boys?

 Sorry but it's true

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/12/central-america-migrants-rape_n_5806972.html 




 But...Is what Trump said true or not? 




 Is what he said about illegal aliens true or not?
