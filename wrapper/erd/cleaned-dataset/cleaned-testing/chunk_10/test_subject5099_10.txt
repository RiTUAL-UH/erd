 This isn't funny at all, in anyway, you sir are sick. 




 It be better for everyone I know if I did. 




 The update hasn't released, the beta-testing period of the update has been opened to super jimmys, there's quite a big difference. 




 You know all the unfair things that happen to people that they die? Like car crashes and fires and muggings? I'd take one of those so someone else didn't have to. I think that would be the best for everyone. 




 Sometimes I think that hole though will be for the better, that all I do is hurt.

I affect things, but not positively.

It would be for the better. 




 I have gone to a mental institution for 8 days, and I can say without a doubt that they were the worst days of my life. I actually fear my home phone ringtone because I'm afraid they're going to take me back.

I wouldn't be here if I had nothing to lose. I'd be gone, but I'm afraid of failing and going back to a place I feel was worse than hell. I'm here, talking to all of you because I want so badly to just have something happen to me, but couldn't do it to myself.

I don't know what to do. 




 It's not the best option though, not from what people say. The best option is to end my suffering and everyone's qualms with me. It's not fair to anyone for me to know how painful I am but still inflict myself on others.

The best option would for me to just never have existed in the first place. 




 Anything I say or do is wrong. People get angry at what I say and do in general and I don't know what I do is wrong, just that it as a whole is, I yet don't understand. I've just accepted my entire existence is the problem, and most people agree.

It's just that though, I'm lazy, or selfish, or something but I just can't help people, but feel like shit that I can't. I've pretty much determined the best way to help people is to not exist at all in my case. 




 I care about others yet can't do anything for them but bring anger and frustration. The only way for me to seriously help people is to get rid of the problem I am. 




 Doing my part consists of being out of everyone's and everythings lives.

I have honestly tried to change myself but it turns out the same, the pain and anger generator I am. It doesn't change the bad I do. 




 Alone in how I am? No.

But alone in people that care about me? Yes, even I don't care about me.

I just want people to have the best, but I don't do anything good for people and if I didnt exist it would honestly make the world better off. I fit in nowhere and ruin everything.

I'm not fit to be around people, they deserve this punishment. 




 I don't. I don't fit in yet I'm not interesting. I honestly just make people mad and I'm terrible to talk to. I can't do anything for people but I want everyone to have the best from me, and the only real way to do that is to not exist. I couldn't care less about myself, I just want others to be better off. 




 The person I most looked to in the world has told me they're better off without me, as most people do when they speak to me over time. I don't fit into the world, I don't have a place, and I just make people angry and hate me. I'd make the world better by simply not existing. What am I supposed to do, make people suffer my presence? It doesn't seem right. 




 Before I got a fan to put under it, my skin would actually blister and melt to my laptop, so that was always fun. 




 It doesn't seem to matter if I admit and regret it, people still end up always hating me. 




 No, but who I am is pretty indicative of who I'll be later in life, someone completely hated by anyone he talks to even for short amounts of time. And to me, that tears me apart. 




 Search for what though? What is there even to search for? I could never be truly happy knowing all I do is cause pain for people. 




 I've poster here before about all the bad things I am and feel. And I still believe them. But I had one person I thought I could trust and talk to and they betrayed me too when I was at my weakest. I'm broken and hurt and feel like I don't have a place in the world. What am I supposed to do. 




 You do know there was an "official release" of the Gym, which was coined as season 1 by Rob? Just something of note. 




 Well that's just what I name it character lore wise, but yes, two :p 









 Well thank you! I learned how to write really from one specific class, up until then I didn't really know and I'm much better off for it.

The best thing to do is practice though! And thank you again! 




 Nice to have more map makers put their own lore on the wiki, I hope mine was okay until you did your own. 




 I had thought it was the elves that were thriving, but could be wrong. 




 May I ask, why the unsatisfaction? 




 I awoke with a jerk.

Today was the day, the day I would finally get to ask Lord Willakers my question. He was returning today after going to H'cet to assess the damage the elves had inflicted.

Long ago, Lord Willakers ruled over an area within a land called Dong Dank; a place filled with dwarves that acted like all sorts of races, but the pure would reside in the Dwarven District, which he ruled. However, ages ago this place fell into disarray, with warring factions and accidental destruction plaguing the land, Willakers set out for a new homeland for his dwarves.

In his travels, he came upon what we now call a shrine. Hidden deep within the Chocolate Mountains, it had a sort of allure to it, a glow and a power that made him feel stronger and more agile. Finding no adverse effects, he would return to Dong Dank and would make an announcement: all the dwarves that wanted to live in general peace, come with him.

Most of Dwarven District did, with a few from the other districts coming as well. They would build a stone keep in those mountains, centered around the shrine they now praised. This is where I am now; Mount Willakers.

I sprung from my spot on the floor to my feet and put on my boots. We don't have much for commodities here but I was able to fasten myself a pair after collecting bits of leather for weeks. I headed outside the great entrance and looked out into the field. Around the entrance we had a wall, and past that, a camp filled with makeshift tents and campfires. You would think we hadn't been here long, but in fact, we've been here ages.

My great-great-great-etc. grandfather came here from the Dwarven District, and I was raised here in Mount Willakers. Our infatuation with the shrines seemed to halt all other progression of our construction, and so we've lived in a camp of tents for centuries. Being one of the original dwarven families however, I was able to sleep inside, which was a treat, as the weather we've been having recently was rather dreary.

Out into the distance I saw the source of our blight in recent times, as storm so black we thought it may have been bugs instead of clouds. It had been swirling for weeks and stayed just to the edge of the field, by the hills at the front. I walked over and found myself a chair, it wouldn't be long before Willakers arrived.

Slowly a crowd would build by the outskirts of the field, awaiting his arrival. Many dwarves adored the Old Man, and while I could say I did, at the same time I was not infatuated with him. He was a dwarf, same as us all, more powerful yes, but just dwarf all the same. After a few hours, I finally spotted him, coming over the hills with his companions; Nisovin, another Lord of Dong Dank, but also the last known Gnome of his time, and Roamin, a rank 11 paladin that was a descendant of the Lord of Brickton.

A path formed between the dwarves for them. Fearing the Old Man's death stare, they knew they had to step out of the way, or be made to. I stayed where I was, I was in no rush, as Willakers would of course remember that it was my turn for a question, an inquiry, and that I would not have to bother him with such petty reminders.

But he didn't, he walked by with his group of gawkers and proceeded to the entrance.

"Well, maybe he did just forget, he is rather busy." I muttered to myself, grudgingly. 

I walked up behind him as he observed the group of dwarves around him, and tapped him on the shoulder.

"YOUNG DWARF, YOU DARE TOUCH ME." He bellowed, with genuine anger in his voice.

"Well, Mr. Willakers, it's just..." I said, trailing off.

"JUST WHAT, WHAT COULD BE SO IMPORTANT YOU TOUCH ME?" He yelled, louder this time.

"Well, today is my question day, and you just, wandered by, is all." I said to him, half shaking.

"Oh, I see, I'll be right with you, sit back over there." He pointed at the seat I had been in.

I put my head down and walked back, sat and observed him. He dismissed his two companions and talked to a few dwarves before he walked over to me, and pulled over a chair.

He sat down and produced a flask of juice from his pocket, swigging it and then putting it back.

"H'cet survived, barely. They've begun to rebuild and this time, will better protect their shrine." 

I stayed quiet. It did intrigue me, these other shrines. Long after Mount Willakers was founded, other dwarves would venture out and discover more, and under the Old Man's guide, would build more keeps around them to protect them from any attacking force. H'cet was one of these, a smaller one, but extremely fortified as it sat right at the edge of Elf land.

"Well, I suppose I should get going quickly, so, what is your question?" He asked, before preparing to stand up.

"Yes sir, of course, well I wanted to know if...." 

BOOM. A lightning strike from the storm beyond, but not just a normal weather occurrence, this was blinding, even for the Old Man. After my eyes readjusted, I gazed out and saw a new anomaly in the sky. 

A dark cloud? No, it looked, like a ship. 

"Dear God, I knew this day would come." Willakers said under his breath.

"We have until nightfall. GET THE WEAPONS READY, FORGE ARMOR, BUILD A WALL, WE NEED THIS PLACE READY FOR WAR, NOW." He screamed out, so that all dwarves could hear.

I was dumbfounded, I had never seen such a structure before and nor had many of the other dwarves, but I did as the Old Man said. I found myself a juice, a runeblade, and a shortbow, and got to work. I was given armor and fletched arrows until nightfall.

We all stood at the edge of the massive forward wall we erected, stretching halfway across the field.

Beside me, another dwarf would remark "I feel kinda sick.", with a few others around making moans and one falling over.

All of a sudden, my comrade fell flat, and then, within seconds, would spring back up, with his flesh falling from his face and armor shedding off, he began to run at me, maw wide open.

Practicing long ago with a sword and bow, I knew the basics of their function but not much else. I swung wildly at him, successfully pushing him back so he could not bite me, and instead ran after another dwarf. After some time, these "zombie" dwarves would drop dead, and dissolve into the ground.

But this wasn't the worst, floods of monsters, ranging from zombies to wolverines were springing from the ship and decending upon the land. We would do our best to defend against them, shooting and swinging at whatever wasn't dwarf. Many of our men began to realize that our blades and shovels had magical properties, that they could roll and "proc" monsters in quick succession after killing one. Using this to our advantage, we would push back the monsters many times to their ship, but when night fell, they pushed back. Hard.

We would be driven back to the inner wall, then the inside entrance, and eventually we found ourselves in the halls, tandem sword fighting and proccing anything that moved. We could hold, but not forever, and eventually we were pushed into the shrine room itself.

The shrine's light, while empowering us, was beginning to dim, as more and more monsters piled in, until finally, it gave way, and after a thunderous BOOM. I found myself without weapons or armor, and suffered a quick death.

Or did I?

I then woke up, found myself on the floor of Mount Willakers once more, with Willakers shouting at the men to armor up and build a wall to defend against the zombie hordes.

"Oh no, not again." I said, with a sigh.

It's endless. 




 **Weapon:** Orion

A "silver" sword that does 15 attack damage and blinds mobs, making them slowed. The glint of the blade is was blinds them, its very bright. This sword is weilded by the Deathseeker, a dwarf with immense power, as he is the only one that can use it.

**Weapon:** Brenna

Its mine. A bow that has such a graceful "twang" when she fires, she pierces the hearts of mobs with double damage, and a spurt of fire erupts around the mob for a second. 




 Praise be the ranger god. 




 Brenna got stuck in a time loop in Oasis for me until we moved realities, hooray wierd timelines! 




 Did he snipe from afar? 




 I went on the DvZ server lobby for 10 seconds and in that time you talked in chat 5 times and had 2 people tell you off. 

You are literally as dense as lead. 




 I can say with certainty that it doesn't really bother any DvZ players and that /u/awesomeshafter in no way represents any sort of opinion DvZers have.

We honestly don't like him. 




 /unjerk

Can you not? He has an opinion, good or not, you don't have to burn him at the stake.

Edit: and I meant that referring to producing an IP, people should never assume anonymity, even if they are entitled to it

/jerk

BURN HIM WITH TORCH 




 He means it sounds like a previous map's name, if you would like to see the names of old maps, look [here](http://dwarves-vs-zombies.wikia.com/wiki/Maps) 




 When I played UHC often, I adored beast, it brought a smile to my face when I saw him in game, when he messaged me. I thought he was an awesome guy, its terrible to see him gone. RIP good buddy 




 When I played UHC a lot, I adored beast, he was always kind and funny. I'm so sorry for your loss, RIP 




 Don't forget the screams. The screams... 




 Nostalgia does not always need to be the best maps, nostalgia can also come from maps like Erebor and Bellows and Molgan too, just to add. 




 Back when he still existed, Pause was the most fun to me, one simple weapon that suits my playstyle, was cool :p. Bruce now, just because Roamin is too easy and bland and I don't like nisovins abilities, just personal preference. 




 It used to be 7 on the gym, that's probably where that came from. 




 No, its not, its spelled YetiiWho92

Edit: ah, my apologies, reflexes

 Is there something wrong with asking for art if people offer it? I love the art I get! 




 That would be awesome! Thank you for taking the time, you didn't have to  ^ ^

 I like it, thank you! 




 XD that's great, thank you :p 




 He didn't create them, all the weapons are from Hypixel's Warlords, and so all he did was reassign the textures to different items. 




 I submitted that, I have not asked her if she wants to play, as it slipped my mind last night, but I submitted it with my name on the off chance she did. If she doesn't, its not like she can't be removed later.

Edit: Also, if at any point someone freaks out she comes on, she won't play, so keep that in mind. 




 This sir, makes me happy, I love it! Thank you  ^ ^  




 Very impressive sir, I like it :p, thank you :D 




 Just me and a friend :p 




 Thank you :P 




 Bellows didn't have armor tables, so yes, we did start with armor like that. 




 Niiiiiiice, thank you! 




 Very nice, thank you :p 




 You sir, are an amazing artist, I thank you a thousand fold  ^ ^  




 Redraw these bows, please? http://m.imgur.com/J41pq4E http://m.imgur.com/a/T82UV   




 Creepy face :L, but looks great! Thank you  ^ ^  




 Nah man, any art someone draws for me is always more than enough, thank you ^^ 




 XD love it 3 




 XD that's amazing  




 :P well thanks for the previous one! 




 They're more personal to me then you might think :p 




 XD sorry, didn't see the name, I always keep the username of the guy that made the art handy, sorry I didn't realize XD, but truly, this is amazing art, I love it :P 3 




 Different, yet, charming! Thank you :p 




 Thank you! You're quite good at pixel art! 




 Sorry I didn't get to you earlier, her slumped against him might be nice, or her sitting down and him laying in her lap, either is nice, but its not terribly important 




 OMG ITS SO GOOD, THANK YOU SO MUCH  ^ ^  




 XD love it
