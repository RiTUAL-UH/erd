 Windows 8 keeps having hiccups on a relatively new HT-PC. By hiccups, I mean that the icons seem to overlap but not function and  switching between windows is problematic. If I restart Explorer in task manager, everything goes back to normal. The specs are: AMD A10, 8 GB RAM, 4TB storage. I'm running it at an odd resolution on my TV, not sure exactly what, slightly less than 720P through HDMI.

 Definitely read this as "A Clever Lump..."

Makes way more sense as "Lamp"
