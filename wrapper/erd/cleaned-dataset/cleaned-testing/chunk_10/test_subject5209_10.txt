 To keep it short, my wife (35F) and I (33M) just got done with a talk about where our failing marriage is headed and if it's something that we want to fight for (I know I want us to work out, but her answer to every question I ask is, "I don't know").

She just left the house without telling me where she was going. I texted her and she replied, "Wow! Last time I checked I was a grown adult!". Is it wrong of me to want to know...just in case something happens to her? I still care and worry about her.

**tl;dr** I'd like to know where she's going at 11:30 at night. 




 Not good enough apparently.  She told me recently that she doesn't love me anymore.  
  
If we get a divorce...is one of those boobs mine? 




 Now that I think about it...I do have a sweater with a hole in it, but it's not covered in grease. :( 




 Bought her new boobs to make her feel better about herself. 




 The last of my exes is now working behind the Wal-Mart deli counter, and my wife is a 1st grade teacher.  
  
Trade up. 




 I have to check the lock on the back door of my house multiple times before I go to bed.  I can see that it is locked, because I am the one who locked it earlier...but I still have to touch it and reassure myself that it is locked at least twice before I feel ok to go upstairs. 




 The Matrix.  
  
I now wonder if I am a shitty program in a computer or not. I don't get updates, my security is a joke, and I don't have a friendly user interface. 




 Take an honest interest in something that he likes. 




 My dad. 









 That's the best kind of ridiculous.

 Bean! Bean! Bean! 




 You have to use the line to convey all emotions, ask/answer questions, and make general statements (think "I Am Groot"). 




 I'm not, an English major; so it's not a: really big...deal - to me. 




 I'd give up 50 years and give the extra life to my dog.

My wife loves him more than me anyway. 




 When she's so impatient in a conversation that she finishes your sentences.

Next thing you know she'll be finishing your food, then your video games, then sex with her. Where does it end?! 




 Please don't, touch my penis. 




 My neighbor when they let their dog shit in my lawn and not pick it up.

I'd time it just right, so my neighbor would start to think that he has a fetish for his dog laying Lincoln logs.

Fuck you, Todd! 




 Her tits. I loved them before the surgery and I loved them after.

She still hates them. 




 Rubbed ointment on my pussy. 




 Anna Kendrick sucks as a girl...at least in my dreams she does.

 Next time, let a doctor handle your enema.  You just tried the home brew version. 




 And now you have a fantastic party trick.   




 Spider-Man, Spider-Man...  
Was over there, now he's in my can!  
Slings some web, in my ass...  
Makes me feel like a little lass!  
Watch out, here's cums the Spider-Man!
 




 Wow! YouTube has a video for everything! 




 I figured as much from the title of the sub. 




 Most cats are assholes, so I guess it makes some kind of sense that he is in yours. 




 And you can use the cardboard tube as a gerbil tunnel! 




 If your anus starts to bleed, stop letting it read Carrie. 




 Knock knock... 




 Been eating some Fusilli? 




 I refuse to click that. 




 Pier 1. 




 I've thanked a cop for pulling me over and giving me a ticket for speeding. I was taught by my dad to be polite through the entire exchange.

You attract more cops with a sugar donut than you would with a vinegar donut...or something like that. 




 I think I just got diabeetus from that comment.

Chop my foot off already. 




 Put a fake mustache on the screen of your television. Every time it lines up with someone's face, take a shot.

Watching the news will get you fucked up. 









 Physically, emotionally, spiritually, etc... 




 Peanut butter. 




 I was still living at home at the age of 26 when I met my future wife (6 years now).

Parents said I could stay as long as I wanted to after high school and college, rent free. Ended up saving up a LOT of money doing that. I was able to pay off multiple cars over the years, built my credit up to a great number, and had a hefty savings for doing special things with my girl (including buying her the rings and wedding that she always wanted).

No ragrets.

Browse the internet and wait for things to break.

I'm in IT. My position is pretty fetch. 




 A really shitty condom. 




 A midget UFC fight. 




 Tickets to a game of whatever sport he likes.

 I live in the southeast, too...and I would suffer a slow, horrible death without air conditioning. 




 Actually, he has Tourettes and you don't know it yet. 




 McLovin would be a great NASCAR driver's name. Brent McLovin. 




 Is it better to be texted too much or not at all? 




 Slack Jawed Willy? 




 I hate you. 




 How bad is it? 




 And I'm upvoting this, because you can spell eclipses...and I can't. 









 In Soviet Russia, dead person kill you! 




 No refunds. 




 Just so he could kill himself again? 




 A genie sneezed on you. 




 If found out, yes. 




 Who would you bring back? Who would you kill? 




 Ever fall asleep in the middle of masturbating? 




 Which is? 




 Fromunda cheese.

And [here's](http://imgur.com/FpSXllG.jpg) one for good measure.

Reminds me of my failing marriage every time I hear it. 




 I don't know how to end sentences... 




 A ladder to the moon. 









 Like peas and carrots. 




 I would ask for something that would allow me to go forth from that place, without being followed by Death. 




 Glue does NOT make a good masturbating lubricant. 




 $91,237.06/year. 




 I spit in the sink every time I wash my hands. 









 Why that person?
