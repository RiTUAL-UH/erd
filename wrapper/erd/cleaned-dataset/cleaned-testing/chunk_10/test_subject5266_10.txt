 I would totally be okay with 3 Tomb Raider universes:

 - Hollywood Survival Action TR Reboot/Rise of
 - Isometric Puzzle Platformer Co-Op Gaurdian of Light series
 - Tomb Raider: Shadow of The Colossus edition

They are all pretty special, it would seem :) 




 I feel more welcome (never had a bad experience) in this subreddit compared to others, for some reason - so in response to the positive skew in this community I want to be all giving 'n stuff. I found some keys I haven't used and thought I could gift them.

Games (Humble gift games - so they are legit)

 - Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic

 - Star Wars The Force Unleashed

 - Star Wars Battlefront II

 - Dead Island GOTY and Saints Row: The Third (come together, unfortunately)

 - Bioshock

Please don't comment unless you earnestly plan to play, or going to give the game to someone who will play the games :]

Please redeem/reply with confirmation them ASAP, will PM the codes! I will try to be random in picking recipients. 

Peace! 




 AH ok, so must be other cinematics they did? Still, all the witcher cinematics have been stellar. 









 I think the studio who did this is making a witcher feature film? http://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/37fwz5/the_witcher_movie_is_being_developed_by_the_oscar/ 




 Tolfdir, teacher at the college of winterhold ): he had a great voice sorry to hear of his passing RIP 




 It sounds better to some peopl too, warmer and organic. If that's your taste. 




 Love Kevin sad to see him go hope to see him pop up somewhere soon. 




 Listen to the interview it wasn't about hyperbole. 




 9 News with the hard hitting journalizm 




 Bill Shorten should also step aside... So should Tony Abbot, Joe Hockey, - hell all of Liberal and Labor - that'd be sweeeeet 




 I used to be quietly pro euthanasia, until I heard the deeper arguments against it, it's not all slippery slope arguments.

Heard a really smart lady on the radio make some excellent points about how extremely careful you have to be introducing it to a society. 

It actually put me on the fence, i strongly recommend everyone inform themselves of the opposing views and the deeper reasoning. I'm not qualified to argue for or against. But as someone who was default in favour of euthanasia, the opposing argument highlights complexities that can definitely make you think. 

I believe the interview was on ABC RN radio national a couple of months ago.

Think it's this one: http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/religionandethicsreport/the-dangers-of-legalising-euthanasia/6570898

On mobile atm so cant verify if that's the lady I heard. 




 One of if not the best reboot in gaming. Loved the first one. 




 Yep he's really measured and not overly cynical. This was a beautiful video. 




 Bratterz, looking forward to this, hope it works smoothly. 




 I'm looking for Whoreson Junior at the moment and got to meet Roche, but I picked Yorveth, he doesn't seem to be annoyed at me or anything. Is this normal?

My save would have imported correctly surely? ._. 




 Any time I see someone being attacked personally or harshly mob criticised I tend to defend them. It's not good, I hate seeing online mobs or people even going near stirring that shit.  




 Do you think being angry and outraged is going to help people get what they want or make this community better at all though? I think it does both things a disservice.

Shaming tactics or personal judgements don't work, instead of angry videos and angry comments, fueling even more angrier videos and worse comments. Maybe people should focus on a more diplomatic tone for any future controversies. It will get people a lot further. 

There's nothing wrong with calmly voicing disappointment but personalizing this is uncouth. 

 




 Can we drop this witch hunt? Obviously no one is going to play ball when part of the critical crowd has actively abused and personally attacked them. It's an unfortunate effect of the outrage machine places like this subreddit actively fuel.

This is the problem with this community and outrage, it gets the absolute opposite of what people want. 

If you want an apology off someone, do you fuel a community to undermine them, attack them, yell at them and make conspiracy theories? Or do you talk respectfully about your disappointment, avoid speculation and stick to principals of mutual respect and kindness?

Godwin's law already broke in the first couple hours of this thread's existence, and people are clueless as to why anyone at the studio might be a little defensive? 




 Actually there are a lot of different communication practices that work extremely well, unfortunately they don't happen to satiate egotistical desires (to put down, feel superior etc.) that violent communication entails - this means people are under the false illusion that the only way to solve a problem is to aggressively voice discontent.

Basically, it's clear Gearbox people feel upset and defensive because there have been many people who attacked them personally and viciously. No reasonable person is willing to parley when people are actively fueling a rage machine against them.

AC:M players feel upset because they didn't get the game they believed was coming, based on the ads.

Do you honestly think if everyone had calmly stated their disappointment with the product, without judgement or assumptions over the character of gearbox staff or any other extraneous side stories, that we wouldn't have a better outcome?

Instead, this anger basically built up a bunch of walls and disillusionment with the critical base and now people are angry about that too? 

It's pretty obvious what happens if you get angry and abusive at someone, they are not going to play ball. Just a natural fact.

 




 Do you think he's likely to apologize if he hears he's being called gaming hitler?

Do you think anyone would react in an amenable way to a mob which is actively attacking them?

There is a human being on the other end, remember that.

The outrage machine goes on :/ 




 That's really cool, I can't wait til these types of projects finish and we can play classic games with modern bells and whistles. It's such a neat way to experience old titles. 




 I disagree, in the grand scheme of things this is very little to get genuinely angry about, we need to focus on positive restoration of what the gaming community wants/needs. Rather than attacking people and demanding it, which ultimately won't yield that good a result. 




 "Don't attack someone personally" is more how I would characterize it.
 




 Im concerned about the anger in this community taking the precedent.  




 How do you know? Why do you get to assume whats okay and not okay to say about the guy? Why do you think that will ever get anything you want out of gearbox by doing that? 




 Is it worth this kind of outrage? Let's not forget people take this tone of argument too far to justify abusive language and that will just make any dev defensive. No apology will come if you attack someone relentlessly, it's not kind or nice. 

Its like 60 bucks. If that money was precious you wouldn't buy before reviews and if it wasn't precious, what's spending more hours of your life angry going to achieve?

At absolute worst, lets not forget some people enjoy the game, a civil note of disappointment would be sufficient along with future caution if you personally believe it's necessary. 




 Jeez you don't know the guy, don't you think it's over the top to throw names at people you don't know for, at absolute worst, not getting a game you were expecting?

You're never getting an apology or whatever you want from any human being if you start abusing them. No doubt gearbox had to endure this because of outrage then too. It's Human nature to not want to capitulate to abusive language - so it is counter productive.

Why cant we as a community talk civilly?
