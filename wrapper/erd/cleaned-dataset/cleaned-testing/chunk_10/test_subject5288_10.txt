 Yes, it's third for me too, behind TS3 and Finding Nemo! 




 Truly a fantastic movie. It's one of my favourite Pixar movies now, and it has definitely got me hyped up for The Good Dinosaur. 




 Inside Out! I loved it :D 




 The Emperor's New Groove is on Netflix, and it's awesome! My favourite movie, though, is Toy Story 3. 




 For obvious reasons. 




 The Nexus 6 uses a Qualcomm processor. 




 Brad Bird - Tomorrowland. 




 In just saw The Emperor's New Groove, and It's hilarious! I haven't laughed so much in a movie since ages. Why it isn't considered as good as the other Disney animated classics, is beyond me.
Edit: Spelling. 




 You should definitely give Inside Out a shot. 




 No... It's been there since a few days when the word on the sidebar was changed to "conservationists". 




 The most epic moment in the movie! 




 A famous quote from my favourite movie. 




 See the pic at the end of the sub... It's hilarious! 




 I hope Pixar shows how the dinosaurs started to look goofy, just like they did with the humans in Wall E. 




 You mean /r/GalaxyS6Circlejerk? 




 Even I don't swear. Not even on reddit. 




 Yes, I like it when I am not stuck in it! 




 It's the current Android design philosophy, introduced along with Android Lollipop. 




 It's my favourite Reddit app. It's currently the one which implements Material Design most accurately. 




 I use Sync for Reddit on my Android phone. 




 You're so new!

It's currently raining heavily

 Hi, fellow Indian! :) 




 The greatest shill of all time. 




 The rant thread at /r/Android has basically become "If Google does not implement x feature, I will switch to iOS." 









 I've always had a strange attachment with the Toy Story characters... 




 Yeah, I am from the future! xD 




 What's a lotto number? 




 8.19 AM, Friday. 




 Kill Bill.

 This reminds me that /u/Unlifer was supposed to eat his Moto G...

 Yup, same with me. 




 :( 




 I find them to be a little annoying... 




 It's one of my favorite Pixar moments, after Ego's monologue at the end of Ratatouille. 




 Inside out was amazing. It's one of my favourite Pixar movies now. 


*Take her to the moon for me* :'( 




 Can't decide between Toy Story 3, Finding Nemo and Ratatouille. 




 Redmi 2. 




 [This is Up.](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/up/) 




 Almost all Pixar movies. And also, The Iron Giant. 









 Jan Pinkava. 




 Ratatouille. They had to change the director midways... 




 Inside Out. 




 After The Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan was supposed to be the next big thing... 




 A lot of studies to do this weekend :'( 




 Ehh... I was 9 when I watched Up and hence it was the first to make me cry. 




 I don't know... The basic plot looks interesting, but the dinosaurs look very goofy. 




 Nexus 6 is literally DuARTe. 




 Up was the first movie to make me cry. 




 Wreck it Ralph. It was much better than Brave. 




 Toy Story. 




 DuARTe wants to spread his light and hence there's no dark theme. 




 I was watching India vs Zimbabwe today... 




 Ashes or India vs Zimbabwe? 




 Anton Ego's monologue at the end of Ratatouille. 




 "Congratulations San Francisco, you've ruined Pizza! First the Hawaiians, and now you!"



Edit: The above quote is from Inside Out. 




 Thanks! :D 




 I had a mathematics and chemistry test... 




 I had to study a lot :(

 I am really tired of Google not updating their Android apps. Why are the  Google iOS apps getting the updates first? Why isn't the Android team competetent? These things are causing people to switch to iOS. 




 *prehistoric 




 /uj Yes, I know this is a 'Going Dark' protest, and this thread feels out of context. I will probably delete it.


 




 /uj I know, I am just trying to make a joke... 




 I liked Lava, but it wasn't anywhere close to being as good as Presto or Geri's Game. Inside Out, though, was awesome. 




 #BuyANexus 




 /r/IAmA went private because they could not handle the heavy traffic due to DuARTe's AMA. 




 **HITLER IS AN APPROVED PROPHET!** 




 In my imaginations... 




 You're not the only one, I have an exam on Monday. 




 I would buy a mobile.

 Toy Story 3. 




 For not accepting Lord DuARTe as the true God. 




 Paperman is by Disney, not Pixar. 




 /uj Yes, the people over at /r/Android cite the reason as "The iOS team is better." That shouldn't matter though, Google should take their Android apps seriously. 




 Have you seen Feast? It's awesome as well! 




 /uj Does Google really want people to switch to iOS? It seems ridiculous that the iOS app was updated before the Android one... 




 Paperman. I also loved Pixar shorts like Geri's Game and Presto. 




 Paperman is by Disney, though. 




 ....some fresh fruit? 




 [Presto.](https://vimeo.com/68386465) 




 Truth! :D 




 Yes, the make-over of Woody by Geri was oddly satisfying.... 




 Geri's Game. 




 ~~Burn them~~ M9 them.

 Also, Isis(Softcard) is owned by Google. 




 Yes, I love BH6. Baymax is awesome! 




 Cars 2. 




 Saw the movie Inside Out. It's awesome. 




 12 AM here, so preparing to sleep... 




 Why do you want to burn yourself? Is your house already on fire? 




 *Cyanoshit 




 Spirited Away. 




 And the disparity between the rich and the poor goes on increasing here... 




 I'm from India. I hate the filth here. 




 Yes, it's my 3rd favourite Pixar movie! (After TS3 and Finding Nemo.) 




 Really a very touching movie. One of my favourite Pixar movies. 




 Be prepared to cry, though! 




 Definitely one of Pixar's best. 




 Yes, the cast, especially Amy Poehler, was amazing! That one part, though :'( 




  That one scene had me in tears, though :'( 




 Yup, it's very emotional. Not as much as Up or TS3, though. But keep your tissues ready! 




 It's absolutely amazing. Pixar's back, guys. 




 Nothing. My day was pretty bad. 




 Yup, I just love cricket! ( Though the loss to Bangladesh was bad) 




 Cricket. 




 The Road to El Dorado. 




 Even I want to see Inside Out badly, it's releasing on the 26th here. I have seen a lot of Pixar movies lately.
