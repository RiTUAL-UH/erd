 Was that model a genuine model, or was it a gag? He's not very handsome. 




 Yes 




  you can see take out of his pocket

That made me cringe so hard. Penn and Teller did not look remotely impressed either. 




 Not really familiar with Bethesda's release schedules, is there much of a chance of a delay? 




 This... how is it unacceptable for them to charge a price point that will generate optimal revenue? What's wrong with it OP? 




 The award for biggest Mangina of all time goes to Michael Sonmore - enjoy the sexually transmitted diseases, enjoy raising Paulo's illicit love child while your wife is off screwing God knows who else, and enjoy the crushing financial burden of the divorce settlement when she finally gets bored of the empty space where your testicles used to be. 




 Why? 




 Right! Agreed! Parents should also be able to euthanise their misbehaved children to based on the fact that they make life hard for them!

Obviously /s

You're applying a very low barrier for the termination of a life here. If you don't want to risk having a child with a learning disability, don't have children. Once you birth them, they're your responsibility though. 




 Just curious, if you used wipes like that to transition between scenes today you'd probably be laughed at. 




 probable cause

It's fucking Snoop Dogg. 




 I'm sorry for your loss. I'm sure your friends were really dank, and here's hoping they have rare Pepes in heaven (or Hell) so your friends can look at them.

Meme on brother. 




 Imagine that day he finally logs on though. 









 Seems a lot less ambient than other packs, I'm just wondering if it ever 'gets in the way', I'm considering a purchase for some variety. 




 Because he's dead. 









 Truly a dank actor, I hope they have rare Pepes in heaven for him to look at 









 Well they were fired halfway through filming. 




 Serious answer: wanting to crush the gay rumors by seriously going overboard with how much he loves the pussy. 

Whether the rumors are true or not, I think that's what happened here. 




 On the other hand, he's probably getting balls deep in his angels every night. Even a faded star can pull pussy if he deludes them into thinking they might become famous through him. 




  Edit: Guys guys guys, I have news, I have terrible news! My inbox is fucked!

Someone just had their first moderately popular comment. 




 I think they do:

 http://www.dotabuff.com/heroes/bloodseeker/items

It's hard to say what proportion of players buy BKB based on that, but I'd think it's a safe bet to say third most bought item would breach the 50% mark. 




 From what I can see, they haven't really removed his major weakness, why is he suddenly so decent? Do people play him Safelane or Mid these days? 









 She looked fine as fuck. I'd love to ram my cock up her ass. 




 Dude, you are fucking SICK. I mean... a cumbox, really?

Nice pic btw. 




 I'm not your guy's moms, so you can do what you want.

Skyfather and above are hard BANNED. 




 Yep, I've even seen photos of the suit. 




 Training lasts for one year exactly and the fight takes place inside an empty warehouse.

* Round 1) Michael Cera gets his bare fists only. His opponents get their standard gear.

* Round 2) Michael Cera has his own Batsuit and standard Batman gadgets (no vehicles). His opponent gets their standard gear.

* Round 3a) Same as round one, but he is trained by Adam West Batman

* Round 3b) Same as round two, but he is trained by Adam West Batman 




 It was actually a fat suit to make him look bigger, plus makeup and stuff to make him look like a woman. 




 Tom Hanks didn't get where he is by not being committed.

The time gap is probably explained by wanting to film What Lies Beneath so he may as well take advantage and lose the weight slowly. 




 I'm smarter than decades worth of directors, actors, producers and general film crew combined! 




 Never read it, what's wrong with it? 




 You've gotta cut sometime bro. I know it's tempting to keep a perma bull going for maximum gains, but if you don't shed the weight you'll never get that dream bod 




 I can't wait to see this on TIL... Again 




 Then you're still enjoying it, hence the money is worth it. The other guy implies he will sit through a movie he isn't enjoying at all just because the money is already spent 




 Because it was nothing but action sequences 




 Are we talking adults or is this a teen fad? 




 He could build his own Las Vegas. 




 Honestly, I'm exaggerating. Movies is right when it comes to certain genres, but I keep letting the hype train for things like superhero movies and action movies get to me. I clearly don't like the genres, but I keep thinking "this one will be different!" It's my own fault.

I thought Mad Max was going to be some revolutionary movie based on the circlejerk, but it just felt like any other action movie with some awesome cinematography, but nothing else to make me care. 




 I already paid for it

Isn't this essentially just the sunken cost fallacy? The money is lost, you may as well enjoy the next hour of your life instead of continuing to be bored simply because you've already paid. What dumb reasoning to continue watching a movie you don't like. 




 I legitimately walked out of this movie about 3/4 of the way through out of boredom. Last time I let /r/movies hype me into seeing anything. 




 It's the final countdown! 




 So C S T is just changemyview with less subscribers? 




 I might be mistaken, but isn't brushing more than twice a day considered bad for your teeth (wears down enamel)?

Therefore, wouldn't it be better to brush after lunch for maximum efficiency since there is actual food matter in my mouth then? So I would 'use up a brushing session' when there is actual food stuff in my mouth instead of after waking up, when it's just bacteria that can be destroyed with mouthwash? 




 It should kill the bacteria that builds up in my mouth overnight, but will not wash away physical matter - which itself is damaging and will attract more bacteria.

I figure, if there is no food stuff in my mouth (as I would have brushed before bed), it seems like a waste of time brushing when I could just mouthwash. I'd rather brush after lunch for maximum efficiency (as I hear brushing more than twice a day is bad, I'd rather 'use up a brushing session' when there is actual food stuff in my mouth). 




 Just don't answer your phone next time. When they ask (or when you arrive, call them back) just say you accidentally packed your phone in your luggage the previous day and didn't find it until you arrived at the airport. Oops, how inconvenient. 




 I would brush once after I got home from work and again after dinner instead. 




 Candyland doesn't use dice. 




 Batman and Michael Cera face off in the children's luck based boardgame "Candyland". Each player has **two years** prep time to learn the rules of the game and play it with their friends.

The cards are shuffled independently by someone else in another room, and neither contender gets any gadgets or can interact with the board or card in any way beyond their intended use. They play a best of five.

Who comes out on top and is King Kandy's hero? 




 How do we know this though?

I think the proof seems to be "if it wasn't for that clue, Batman never would have caught the Riddler". But if the Riddler wasn't leaving DELIBERATE clues, Batman might find clues that he he accidentally left. Maybe the crimes are riddled (cough) with clues that Batman doesn't need to find because the Riddler gives away his identity anyway.

Basically, we don't know how good the Riddler is at covering his tracks because we never need to look in the first place; he always leaves obvious fucking shit around. 




 Wouldn't not leaving clues be the best proof of all? 




 She's fat. 




 Remember kids, drink Slash cola 




 Probably a stupid question, but if it's the cinematography that makes all these shots look great, what is the director's involvement? I thought they'd be the one to decide this stuff. 




 [Brendan Fraser's website.](http://www.brendanfraser.com/)

My favourite is the about section that stops updating in 2001.

ACT IV: Coming Soon 




 Yes. 




 That's 0 words. Date was ruined when you found out she was fat. 




 Exactly the kind of stuff I was looking for. Would commoners have uttered this phrase or paraphrased it? 




 That's what I thought 2-3 years ago but now I'm doing fine 




 I literally just played this movie for four kids at a sleepover two days ago and they loved it 









 For example, if I picked a random Beethoven symphony, what percentage of the music was written by him? All of it, or would he have instruments he didn't know how to play. Maybe he say down with his go-to violinist and asked him to help him fit some violin into this upcoming piece. 




 Maybe, but I don't see how the trailers are proof of this.

They're sentimental because they're trying to appeal to your nostalgia. 




 I never want any character on GoT to die, but the fact they they willingly kill them off, often without fanfare, is part of the reason I like it.

Imagine the impact if loveable Tony Stark was crushed to death in his tin suit by Ultron instead of Ultron being a massive pushover.

MCU needs some deaths. Brutal, sudden deaths too. No sacrificing yourself in the last 10 minutes to save the world with a big goodbye speech and dramatic music. Let's have the villain brutally fuck one of the main characters up out of nowhere. 









 I suppose it doesn't have to be sudden, but I'd like it to be. 




 I was unaware that we weren't allowed to have discussions on the subject matter of the picture and just had to stick to "is this facepalm or not".

You're allowed to do whatever you want, I just think you are jumping to conclusions (he's lying so it is effecting him negatively? that's a leap, maybe he's lying because she gets upset over something as trivial as porn)

Also, that you respond to MY comment with this and not the person I initially responded to

I was replying to the chain, the message applies to anyone jumping to conclusions.

 but then you say it's not worth figuring out

I was figuring it out. I was just saying there are possible, reasonable alternatives so no need to jump to one conclusion.

Swear to christ guys get so pissy any time they feel like something threatens their "naked girls" time.

I'm not pissy, you sound a bit mad though.

I know so many guys who get pissed if their GFs watch porn by themselves, but if a girl doesn't like it we're just bitches.

The guys are wrong too

 Her breasts? 




 I remember this interview, it was released literally a couple of days before reviews landed.

He would have seen the final cut at that point and may have known it was going to reek and decide to backpedal. He may even have already read a few of the bad reviews. 




 Or she's whipped him and won't let him look at naked girls on the Internet every now and then.

We know literally nothing about this guy or girl or their relationship, why even bother trying to work out if he's an addict or she's against any porn? The facepalm is openly talking about it on Facebook and that's all the matters. 




 Am I the only one that didn't like this film? I thought the concept was great, but the dialogue was trash. 




 It's literally just preference. There are albums with no cohesive narrative or reason for their ordering that I like to listen to in order (or sometimes not!) and there are albums that do have an intended listening order or even have songs that flow into one another and I don't even own the entire album, because their hits are fine for me.

Listen to the album in whatever way increases your enjoyment. For most albums, I'll listen to it in full or on shuffle quite happily. 




 Please no hits, please no hits, please not hits

About 58,100,000 results (0.25 seconds) 

AH FUCK 




 But if the group of people referred to themselves individually as 'Batman', they'd still be Batmans.

You don't have to be a clone of Bruce Wayne. You just all have to have "Batman" as a proper noun. Same as a group of people with the name "Steve" would be "Steves". 




 Well the joke wouldn't work with a bad villain. 




 I do not think there has been any villain so far that needed the whole team

Yes, this is the problem. We just happened to be using Ultron as an example 




 Then the winner squares off against Paul Blart 




 Definitely 




 I crafted some decent gear and did a lot of sidequests so now I outlevel everything. I still use them for bosses or throw the occasional Tawny Owl out just to speed things up a bit, but most enemies die in a few hits and are easy to dodge regardless of whether I use potions or not. I might get hit once per fight so it's not worth the hassle of opening the menu up and scrolling down to my pots.

I think that's the main problem with this game - there are lots of sidequests, which  is great, but the leveling isn't spread out enough. You just end up outleveling everything by exploring and before you know it you can equip some mean ass sword or armour. 




 I don't know, I rarely touch Igni and I'm using a alchemy build and rarely use pots/oils and still finding it too easy. I hope the DLC has enemies that scale with level or something. 




 I suppose we better make sure to add spoiler tags when discussing Soylent Green too? Better not spoil that twist!

No one is suggesting that spoilers don't become important when 100% of the population has viewed it. Instead, there is a point where something is well known for long enough that it becomes the responsibility of the individual to avoid obvious sources of spoilers and not the community to do so 




 I still do

 Paul Blart vs The Incredible Hulk 




 No 




 I think he meant the movie representing Crackle was a weird choice. I mean, it's really out of left field  




 I usually do job applications the day after they are listed, is this putting me at much of a disadvantage. Should I aim to do them ASAP? 




 Are you attractive though?

 Fuck off.

 By definition a desert is a place with a lack of rainfall, so yes 




 How is this a pussy***pass***? She hasn't been charged or let off.

Anyway, I can't even find better sources for this, I'm not sure if it's real. Admittedly it was a lazy search, but her name doesn't come up in any reliable news sources in Google. 




 What's the perspective here? People are going to die so company's shouldn't work on improving custom service? Because one thing is bad everything else should be? 









 Plus your father is gay 




 Geralt and Triss have had a few too many cheeseburgers 




 I imagine this system would work best along these lines:

-Chores are laid out

-A rotating roster is created

-A dollar value is assigned to each chore

-If someone does not complete that chore on schedule, the next person in line completes it

-The person who didn't do it pays that person

Basically, focus on punishment for not doing rather than payment for doing. 




 I'm sorry, but no one is getting past the Silverback Gorilla. Period. 




 It doesn't take me three years to get a psychiatrist appointment though. 




 Or they should just leave them how it is. It's not exactly hard to explain. 




 She didn do nuffin wrong 




 The satisfaction of showing her this video in ten years time would be amazing. I would really love to be apart of that. 









 OP omitted some improtant details. If you look closely at the sky in Mad Max you can see that there is actually a big, glowing red orb, also known as the Sun. This sun can be visibly seen in the sky in the Borderlands universe.

Vice versa is also true. 




 Yeah but her figure is terrible. Look at that waistline. Ew 




 And Conan is 6'4''.

 Money? Oil? What exactly? Is it something we can point to and say "yup, there it is!"

I should also clarify I know this because they didn't have electricity back then so that G Beethoven must have done it in the day (he was allergic to candles). 









 I don't understand this line of thinking.

Film critics reviews are tools. If you generally agree with a critic's opinions, then it's a good tool for determining what movies you watch down the track. Or you can read around the opinions to determine if the movie is something you might like based on their summary. Or they may save you from seeing particularly bad movies (most of the stuff at the bottom of RT wouldn't be to your liking, right? So statistically reviews aid you).

No one can see every movie ever made, reviews are useful. 




 Wow, a great deal for Steam then if people decide to rebuy it after it gets fixed. 




 Not as common as you might think. Here are some names: Bob, John, Frank. Notice any Es? 




 Get it? 221 B's. Sherlock was a beekkeeper and likely kept in excess of 221 bees. 




 True, but that was the point: it's not worth it and they are fixing it, but only because of the recent implementation of refunds. It's 'unfortunate' (from their perspective).

They still new what they were doing, they're not idiots, it just backfired. 




 No, but they know about their preferences over a failed product vs a delayed product. The can see the numbers of sales for franchises, gauge consumer interest, and other financial data to determine their preference in this area.

It was also likely the last Arkham game so hurting the brand isn't as important.

Knowing how to actually play the game is irrelevant. Just as they're out of touch with how to put their face in a WiiU, you would probably be completely out of touch with how to make a good return on investment.

They knew what they were doing and it would have worked if not for the unfortunate timing with the refunds system. 




 Posting [Blank] is cheating! XD 




 I don't know about *every* president. 




 Do people actually think this might jeopardise their kid's futures? 




 The similarity between House and Holmes names should be a dead giveaway. The homage is so obvious.

Both Sherlock and Gregory have Es in it for the few that don't get it 



















 He's saying "Why, is that one better?" not "Why is that one better?" 




 Yeah, too many correct answers!

 He's a complete fucking nut job unfortunately  




 Jesus, it's not like RDJ didn't get much screen time  




 So I did this a short time ago with [heroes](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/3c9t4h/batman_peter_parker_reed_richards_and_tony_stark/) and said I'd consider doing it again with villains (well, antagonists since I included Adrian). So here it is. Some of this will be copy pasted from the other thread, but I made some changes to the rounds:

It's the current US Shark Tank. Each character goes on assuming a secret identity - that of a young entrepreneur in their early 20s. This eliminates the default perception of the character (ie. investors feeling safer investing with Wayne, a billionaire, as opposed to a mere Uni student). However, they keep their current personalities. **Important note: Any item pitched is free from existing patents, etc., so basically ignore issue of ownership for existing items**

* **Round 1)** Each makes a new invention designed to resolve a common household problem. It can be any problem, but must be applicable to a typical home. They have 24 hours to choose a problem and create the solution. Each has $500,000,000 at their disposal for some overnight R D. And what problem do you think each is likely to address?

* **Round 2)** Any invention they have ever made - they MUST have made it personally (eg. Adrian had Manhattan's help). Pick the one you think would have the most success from each character and pit them against eachother.

* **Round 3)** Each must gain funding for a plan to cause mass destruction. Specifically, they must pitch an item, project or service to that Shark Tank crew that can secretly be used for ulterior evil motives. For example, tricking them into funding a new brand of toothpaste that contains mind controlling fluoride. Remember, the investors will be watching the project careful, so you can't simply take the money for one thing and build a nuke with it.

**Remember to take into account marketability**, affordability (even the Shark Tank guys aren't likely to pitch in for a Batmobile), rough manufacturing costs, etc, and the individual personalities of the Shark Tank hosts. I haven't seen much US Shark Tank, but I know in the Australian version you can get an idea of which host is likely to go for which products.

Finally, major problem with the last one: The Shark Tank guys are rarely ready to invest for more than a few hundred thousand. Is getting an Iron Man suit to market at all possible with that amount? 




 Iron Man is more maneuverable, more durable and has a greater arsenal with superior target tracking. I think he wins, unless I've forgotten some particular overpowered Megaman abilities (timestopping would be his best advantage). 




 This is just getting creepy. 









 Are you for real? Deadliest =/= 100% success rate, just the highest success rate.

Anyway that's irrelevant since he's obviously referring to known assassins. 




 Is there any requirement on budget, etc. for these movies?

Can't they just get a bunch of costumes from a nearby store and film the Fantastic Four playing frisbee in the studio parking lot for 120 minutes and call it a movie? Who cares if it bombs if you've only spent a few hundred dollars on it. 




 Literally every Tarintino movie 




 Haha yeah niggers can be a bit much sometimes but this was something else 




 Soft drink. They're all fat as fuck as well 




 I hope this scumbag got a two week paid vacation and a promotion for this. 




 Daughters* 




 Once I get my kindle waterproofed, 30 minutes minimum 




 Where on the Internet? 




 I would imagine ex-Presidents wouldn't have anything like Ground Force One to drive around in, but do they still get equally detailed sweeps of places before speaking, as many guards on duty in their homes, etc?

What are the major differences? 




 High quality preferred but does not need to be official. 




 I want to read in the bath, shower and swimming pool. Ideally I'd like to be able to let it be fully submerged.

(Alternatively, are there any cheap e-readers with 'built in' waterproofing?) 




 I want to read in the shower 




 If money is the determine factor for considering something a sport, then I guess investing is a sport too.

Anyway, I imagine most e-sports players would be incredibly poor. After they split their winnings with teammates and owners, etc. 




 60k isn't even a lot of money, unless these tournaments are numerous and your team is constantly winning. Remember, it's split 5 ways. I can earn more on a part-time minimum wage job in a year. 




 They were thinking swiggity swooty 




 Yeah but maybe OP secretly thinks she's ugly too
