 In the KS comments they note that this phone is an upgrade to an existing phone they've already sold in China. That's eerily similar to other projects that have been called out for importing/rebadging already made products.  
As always, buyer beware. 




 Here's another [breakdown](http://www.microsoft.com/investor/EarningsAndFinancials/Earnings/PressReleaseAndWebcast/FY15/Q3/default.aspx)  
It looks like Devices and Consumer Licensing is about a third of Commercial Licensing, which includes Windows VL. 




 They still rake in a tidy sum from licensing Windows, as this report from couple years ago shows http://www.tannerhelland.com/4993/microsoft-money-updated-2013/  
Not sure on the home vs business breakdown tho 




 Different? PC gamers, a majority of which run Windows, with games bought primarily ([~50%+ of digital distribution market share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_%28software%29#Market_share_and_impact)) from Steam in the last decade, there's some overlap I think.

 What about subreddits that hide downvote buttons, even for subscribers?  
Even though it doesn't prevent actual downvoting, doesn't trying to hide them reflect on the sites integrity?

 Depends on how you interpret this:  
["We are moving from a strategy to grow a standalone phone business to a strategy to grow and create a vibrant Windows ecosystem that includes our first-party device family."](http://news.microsoft.com/2015/07/08/satya-nadella-email-to-employees-on-sharpening-business-focus/) 




 Interesting that this comes after last weeks rumor about [MS ditching windows phone](http://www.techradar.com/us/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/microsoft-is-about-to-kill-windows-phone-claims-bold-new-rumour-1298038).  
Edit: also direct link  
["We plan to narrow our focus to three customer segments where we can make unique contributions and where we can differentiate through the combination of our hardware and software. Well bring business customers the best management, security and productivity experiences they need; value phone buyers the communications services they want; and Windows fans the flagship devices theyll love."](http://news.microsoft.com/2015/07/08/satya-nadella-email-to-employees-on-sharpening-business-focus/) 




 Cool, these are only about $30: Intel PRO/1000 PT Dual Port Server Adapter 




 The mb has dual Intel NICs on it would I still want more?      http://www.asrockrack.com/general/productdetail.asp?Model=E3C224D4I-14S#Specifications 




 Thanks! Yep, I'm thinking maybe using WD Red/Red Pro HDDs instead so that I can repurpose them for a proper NAS later on. 




 Hi all, I'm looking to build my first homelab server. I currently have a couple Raspberry Pi's that I have running ownCloud, OpenVPN,   nginx and I want learn how to scale up and possibly recreate my mini Pi-lab on bigger hardware.  
I have an NCASE M1 that I purchased a year ago that I'd like to use for this, hence the small ITX motherboard.  I wanted to start out building an all-in-one like I've seen from some others in this sub where I run ESXi as a host, and then test running VM's like Nas4free/FreeNas/Unraid, Windows 2012 R2, Sophos UTM/pfSense, Slackware,   Debian.   
Here's what I was thinking of:  
* CPU - Intel Xeon E3-1241V3  
* MB - ASRock E3C224D4I-14S  
* RAM - 32GB Crucial ECC 1600Mhz  
* HDD - 3 x WD Black 3TB drives  
* SSD - Intel S3610 400GB  
* PWR - Silverstone SX500-LG  
* FAN - Noctua NH-U9S  
  
Thanks, let me know if you have any suggestions!

 My personal comparison is between an update to Cube World or a Jolla/SailfishOS phone released in the US. 









 This is the page they'll be updating throughout the month. 



















 Someone should write up a list of customizations/options lost if updating from Win7 to Win10. 




 Who would've guessed that making broadband a utility would lead to politicians wanting a piece of the pie through some amusement tax. 




 I'd guess the FCC making broadband a utility opened up some loophole.

 Thanks FCC  
[While its order does not explicitly impose new taxes, it does open to the door for others to tax the Internet for the first time under existing state and local laws, and will likely lead to further expansion of taxes in years to come.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2015/03/13/net-neutrality-is-setting-the-stage-for-internet-taxes/)

 Broadband is a public utility now, net neutrality, get ready for more 'taxing' fun on anything going over the pipe.
