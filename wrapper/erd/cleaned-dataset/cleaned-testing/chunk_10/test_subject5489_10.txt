As conservative as this article is, it brings up another good point.

Poor people can't pay toll violations. Rich people can. Rich people also fund these toll road projects with investment and government subsidies.

 




 Hummingbirds...hummingbirds are illegal tender! 




 It's illegal to keep a hummingbird as a pet. That's for sure. 




 Sobriety is "not" something to promote... people that want/need to quit weed need to find out about a community somewhere...

I disagree, but completely respectfully. Addiction is scourge on our world, and people need a way out. A community does that.

As for what normies do? I could give two shits. Half my family smokes weed and they handle their shit fine. Legalize it for all I care. 




 So... here's one.

I take a toll road sometimes. But in order to do that, I have to sign up for a pass online. The pass has an infered signal that tracks when i use the toll road and charges me either per month, or everytime I use it. Also, I don't have to have the pass in my car. My car is registered online.

If you don't have the pass, a computer, and a debit/credit card, you kind of can't drive on the same toll road as me. There are no coin machines or employees. It's all electronic.

 I used to be addicted to... and you may not believe me.... but weed.

Smoked about 5 years since turning 18. Was sloppy. Not productive. Desperate. Ended relationships, friendships, and ties with family in pursuit to get high. Almost went to jail a few times. Contemplated prostitution. Pretty familiar with CraigsList. I sadly could go on and on of the terrible decisions I made. To quote MC Chris, "Weed is by my side, it's always been there."

Been sober almost 2 years now. Sobriety isn't for everyone. It's kept me sane.

 




 Dude i took my boyfriend here recently, and he was like,  

"WHY WOULD WE WAIT IN LINE FOR FOURTY MINUTES FOR ICE CREAM?!?!"

To which I explained,

"Gucci Mane loves Afters."

He tried it after a lot of convincing. And he loved it. Myself, Gucci Mane, and Afters had won. 














 eh.... I'm surrounded by chaparelle  sage brush, and i'd sure love if millionaires didn't use potential wildfire/house fire designated public water for their palatial McMansions and acres upon acres of land. Instead, use it for, you know, stopping fires and such.

Record breaking drought aside, of course. 














 Haha I'm flattered my account has come under such close scrutiny!

Yeah I was a musician for ten or so years, and I've worked at a GLBT Center at my old school, suppose the two things are... mildly important to me. Mildly. Animals are more interesting than people and their arts. But that's just my opinion.

 Without this movie, how else are we supposed to know that there's a 60% chance it's already raining? 




 Here's our story...

I had an OK cupid account, and in my bio I wrote about dog grooming/breeding and the conservation of endangered species, two things I care deeply about. So he messages me:

"Tell me about how you would groom a panda."

He's cute enough, so I do. I tell him about their habitat, their thick coats, their behavioral tendencies in capitivity, animal husbandry, etc.

He's dumbfounded and we make little banter after that.

Fast forward three weeks... I'm sitting in English class, and I see him on Scruff, but I didn't put two and two together, I hardly remember talking to him on OkCupid. We talked for days straight.

So we agreed to coffee. I looked like a disheveled mess with all my books and notebooks for school. He thought it was weird that I called him versus texting him about a change of coffee shop.

It was an awkward first date, I was head over heels for him, he was mildly interested but needed me to wow him.

We were saying our goodbyes, he said he was sure we'd just be friends until he saw me lean on my car, like in the movies. One leg on my car, one on the ground, confident. 

He asked me for a kiss right then and there.

 It is a custom often practiced by seafaring people to throw a bottle overboard, with a paper, stating the time and place at which it is done. In the absence of other information as to currents, that afforded by these mute little navigators is of great value.

 As a dog groomer, I think I have pet around 70 different breeds, and like 800 variation of mutt. 

I also have an idiot savant like ability to identify dogs I see in public, usually in a shrill, gay-man screaming sort of way.

"OMG IS THAT A GERMAN WIREHAIR POINTER?!"

"....Yeah?"

 I want that to be the reason why she was sitting there so badly. Just waiting. 









 My normal MO at the grooming salon is to GTF away from cats. I'll scruff them, but i won't do nails, trims, sannies, paws, lion cuts, ANYTHING! My boss can handle that, or really anyone else in the entire world.

well... I opened my big mouth and offered my services to my roommate. I have cat nail trimmers (I use them for tiny, tiny dogs) and Quik-Stop.

Suggestions? Like scruffing, at home surface to do it on, posture, any good diagrams or websites, ANYTHING would help. 




 I was just at a kibbutz near the northern gaza border 3 days ago. We went and saw children playing, a yellow lab much like my own that had been there for years, families working farms so proudly, children going off to the military; the Israeli dream. 

I also saw roofs so thick that explosives used to not penetrate them, bomb shelters every 10 yards, 18-22 year old military members on constant patrol, fences and concretes walls not to block out the Palestinians, but to stop snipers. 

They live on the edge of oblivion for the Jewish people to have one country. One home. One place to raise a family that is their own. 

I don't know how this centuries old situation will work out, I just pray peace comes soon.

 4 continents and 30 states, but that's irrelevant. I meant more so that could be anywhere.... 




 I think what's shocking for me, other than the incredible loss of human life, about this is how normal that shopping plaza looks. I mean, yes, this is Texas, but I'm looking at the shopping center I'm at in California, which has it's own history with [mortor cycle gangs](http://www.vcstar.com/news/local-news/crime/gang-expert-testifies-at-hells-angels-trial), and this could easily happen here. Guns rights.... concealment laws... None of it matters when you're dealing with psychopaths with a war like mentality :(

My heart and prayers go out to those affected.

 Yes! The Incan orchid! Such a beautiful dog breed, though if you are to get one, only use positive reinforcement, as both breeds can be quite sensitive to negative tones and volumes. Very intelligent and intuitive breeds. They are warm and soft to the touch, requiring sun screen, sweaters, constant water and yearly vet visits to limit skin damage. Loss of teeth is quite common, as is acne and skin cancer.

Perhaps I need to delete this post, but at the same time, knowing we all care so much about being there for each other in this crazy rat race of love, well, that's well enough to leave this post up.

 If you disagree with the idea of AKC purebreds, look in to landraces and pariah dogs. They are bred for job and function, and not appearance. Bali street dogs, Canaan Shepherds, Central Asian Shepherds, Armenian Gamprs, etc.

Surprisingly, Russia is and has been on the forefront of good dog breeding in this regard. Form AND function. Not cuteness and marketability. 

These ridiculous American designer dogs and overbred AKC dogs will be the down fall of respectable dog breeding.

 I work with some of the sons of modern day Lassie! I'll try to pull up some grooming pictures if anyone cares enough. They're incredibly regal animals.

EDIT: [K... found some. I use a blue whitening shampoo on him. Then, blow dry for an hour. Then 40 minutes of brushing. Trim his feet. Amazingly beautiful dogs. Direct blood relative of Lassie! This one was just a little too slow to work in movies i think....](http://imgur.com/a/u8hfL) 




 Just brush your cat. Honestly. That's all the issue is. If the groomer sees a matt, they can shave it out.

Whether your cat is happy or not is sheer anthropomorphism. Aside from hormone levels, you'd have no idea. 

All this aside (which I am right, I see it everyday), it probably doesn't matter anymore, because your cat's coat is at this point trashed and unsalvageable, like a blonde that gets platinum hair dyed every single month.

More! 




  Cats, in particular, are very good at regulating body temperature and "really get no benefit from being shaved," says Mark J. Stickney, DVM, clinical associate professor and director of general surgery services at Texas A M University's veterinary medical teaching hospital.

 I groom dogs, but our salon grooms cats as well.

Please don't get a lion cut!

Your cat is safer and better for just a bath and a blow out! They will get all the undercoat out. Plus, it's cheaper.

You cut the hair, it will never grow back the same after 2 or more haircuts.

Also you risk thyroid problems, acne, the cat getting cut; it happens.

 Lil Debbie,

I don't know how many other gay men feel this way, but you've been a huge inspiration for me through out the years. It sounds odd, I know, but you just ooze raw empowerment, and don't give no fucks. So thank you so much. You've helped me out of some dark places, and brought up the volume on some of the better times in my life.

Can you discuss some of the writing process, maybe some of the inspiration, for
your album Young Bitch. Since you've released it for free, I've been listening to the entire thing daily. Me and You is like my theme song now.

I really hope you're high as fuck right now. You got mad love coming from the Valley.

 









 I was thinking about a fake business meeting this guy I'm dating needed to have with me...

See... He's in the closet, and in an internship at a financial institution. I guess he needed to meet a quota or something. So he asked me to meet with his boss to meet his quota. I was freaking out about it all day. So, I came an hour late and did it. The whole thing was awkward and hilarious.

Bonus, got tons of kisses, and in the movie afterwards, one of my favorite celebrities was sitting a few seats ahead of us!!!! So all and all it was a sweet day.

 I need a cordless. I'm so jealous of the groomers I work with that have it.

Though I also think I need another heavy duty clipper. It's large, yellow and black, and when my boss has let me use it, it cuts like freaking butter. I wish I knew the brand.

I... I just want it all.
