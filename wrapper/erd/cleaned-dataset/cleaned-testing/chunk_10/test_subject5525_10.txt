 Florida may be bigger than you think. Coming anywhere in particular? Panhandle? Disneymania? Gulf Coast? The Keys?
 









 Mmmmm...potato salad. 









 Seconding the opinion to keep going. It starts rather slow with Frannie and Harolds story, and the beginning of Larry Underwoods story there at the beginning...but it is necessary to their character development later in the story. 

Are you reading the unabridged version? That might have something to do with the slow pace at the beginning...The Stand is one of my favorite of King's; it's absolutely worth reading. Stick with it. 
























 Yeah, I know...but good pics.

 









 Florida, touristy beach area. 

Domestic beers are $3.50 or $2.50 during happy hours.
Imports run from $4 to $7, depending.

Wine by the glass from $3 (happy hour) to $14, bottles from $22 to $40.

Liquor cheapest during happy hour $2 for wells, otherwise from $3.5 to $16 depending on brand. 




 Two things: 

First, wrong sub. 

Second, a record only has one groove. The needle travels from beginning to end, reproducing sound (or lack of) along the way. The groove has variations that are transmitted via the record needle as sound waves; this is the music. So, to answer your question, you could theoretically have a record big enough to contain one groove that could have a combination of all the sound ever recorded or to be recorded, but it would be bigger than the universe itself.  




 Life with Penis 101...lol

I wouldn't want to run without securing myself up a bit...usually with some tighter underwear or when I sport heavily, with a jock strap. (Though I have heard some distance runners like to go without undies at all...*shudder). I am aware of it being there when I'm running or sporting, but no more so than say my nipples. Or my ears.

If I'm in a pool *naked* then yes it sort of floats around. Otherwise it's in the netting you find in most boardshorts/swimwear. It's there for a reason.

Lol...I don't feel the need to pee in my dick. It's in my bladder. Though I can feel my urethra opening up when I pee, especially in the morning...it's not entirely unpleasant.

When I ejaculate, the orgasm sensation is a whole body thing that sort of radiates from my penis, but I am aware of my ejaculate making its way through my urethra, yes.

Occasionally I am aware of my penis growing or shrinking, but not really...it does that through the day. Usually its just a bit of annoyance, I have to readjust myself and I can't always do that in public. The only time I'm surprised by an erection is morning wood, but not even a surprise really, as I expect that...I'm just not aware of it happening. (I've read somewhere that a man gets 6-10 erections a night, something to do with bloodflow IIRC)

Fun Penis Fact: The wrong bike seat can cause your penis to "fall asleep"! Especially on long bike rides...pins and needles are equally pleasant and the Worst. Thing. Ever.

 




 Water hazards are part of the game. You just have to approach them with your skill set in mind. On my home course, there is a lake on the 18th, and its about 250' from the pad. Depending on wind, sometimes I go over, sometimes I drop a placement shot on the shore and take par. It's a good practice in shot shaping and shot selection. Not every hazard has to be bullied through; sometimes finesse is the answer. Share that. Also, lost plastic is the excuse for new plastic! 




 1. You like cooking chicken thighs, but you make the same thing every time? Try something new. Much of cooking is trial and error, and experience. Look up recipes online and try them. Try different cooking methods; bake them, simmer them in a sauce, slow cook them a crock pot, deep fry 'em. Keep notes of what you like and don't.

2. Shopping should become about staples. (Food staples are the things that I would expect to find in every kitchen: sugar, flour, rice, etc.) Expand on your staples to include different types of the same food. Buy in bulk when appropriate. Over time you will build a kitchen with the goal being that when you want to try a new recipe, you only have to buy one or two ingredients, if that. With most of your staples handled, most (simpler) recipes should be made with ingredients you already have.

3. Practice. There are tons of easy recipes out there, find ones that interest  you and try them. If you're interested in becoming a better cook, look for recipes that feature one (or two) ingredients you haven't worked with before and one (or two) cooking or prepping methods that you haven't done before. Once you learn a skill, you can apply that skill to other recipes. The internet is your friend, but if you prefer the paper cookbooks, pick up a copy of Joy of Cooking; it's still the best all-around cookbook out there. Covers everything from appetizers to desserts, but plenty of information beyond and behind the recipe...gives you some of the *why* of food, not just the *how*. 

Happy cooking. 




 That there is a misprint Sidewinder, probably. The Boss stamp is for a blizzard run, and the plastic doesn't look like blizzard in your picture. (Blizzard plastic with all the freakin' bubbles, right?) Without seeing edge on, or underneath markings (if any) I'd guess sidewinder. Good find either way for a ten. 




 Again, I don't know Daytona (mostly because the NSB is just so freakin' awesome) but I would imagine there will be so many people out there firing off that as long as you don't bring heavy artillery, or glass or pets, or drugs, or reeeeaaaaly ramp up the assholery, you could do just about whatever you want out there.
 




 Lol...lighting fireworks on the beach is illegal. That's funny. 

Honestly, I live just south of Dirtona, in New Smyrna Beach, where it is also illegal to set off fireworks on the beach. The beach is the best place to go see fireworks; all the condos set off big ones, everyone's out there doing their own thing, it's insane. I can't imagine that Daytona is any different. 
























 [Google the Fermi Paradox](https://www.google.com/search?q=theory+of+life+on+other+planets ie=utf-8 oe=utf-8#q=the+fermi+paradox)...it talks about the apparent high probability of life on other worlds and the incredible lack of evidence of any life on other worlds. It's too heavy to get into here, but one of the neat things about Fermi's equation is the quantifying of Time.

Think about just how incredibly big the Universe is. Even if other life forms had some sort of faster than light drive, Time would still be a huge factor. Maybe we're the first in an timeline of life that will stretch for millenia...or perhaps we're the last folks on that timeline. It may be that the Universe just absolutely teems with life...but at sufficient distances that travel between them is near impossible...or long enough that by the time we get there (or they get here) that civilization is long gone, and turned to dust.

Dig into Fermi's theory. It's an interesting thought experiment, and it helped me begin to understand just how freakin' big the Universe is, and that big means...time, not just size. 




 Now that is odd. Why would people willingly live in such a place? They don't even have hot dogs apparently.... 




 Do people still live there?
 




 Yep. Similar in Florida. We'll put mango salsa on just about anything, but I've never had it on a dog. We get so many yankee visitors here, the majority of my hotdog experience has been more New York than Key West. 




 Dress nice. Smell good. Smile. Look eager, but not crazy. The second interview with the GM is decision-making time. Most of the time this is not a "formality" interview, but more like the other managers winnow through the other applicants, and bring in a few for the GM to choose from. If the job is in the US, you more than likely will be only offered server minimum, so no negotiation there, but do ask, it looks intelligent. You may know that you have the job at the end of the interview, or it may be a follow-up phone call situation. If you don't hear from them in a week or so, give them a call. Once. Just once.  Good luck!
 









 You're 19, essentially a grown-up; you have to decide what is right for you, and what is right for you and your bf. As long as you live in your parents house, however, you must respect their rules and beliefs as a matter of respect. I recommend some soul-searching as to how you feel about your own views regarding pre-marital sex, and then talk to your bf about those views. Then maybe get a hotel room or something where you can have some privacy...or his house. Or move out.  



























































 My guitar. My life has had its ups and downs, just like  everyone else, but I've started over so many times I've lost count. The one thing I would always do before giving up on whatever was happening was sling my box across my back before I hit the road. I've had that guitar for almost 25years now and every time I look at it in reminded of how far I've come and how much I've overcome. Its become sort of a talisman for my ability to survive anything that life may throw at me. 




 I've lived in both cities. I like them both. If the urban sprawl of Orlando is not your thing, you're not going to like the Tampa area. It's very much like the Orlando metro area. But Tampa has a vibrant music and art scene, and there are quiet places to find in the surrounding area. I grew up in Pinellas Park area, and the Gulf beaches are awesome, and all the the littler cities along the gulf are kinda chill. Not a lot of wide open green spaces though...
I think I prefer Tally. Great music scene, lots of art and events, but it still has a little bit of a smaller town feel. It's neat to experience the ebb and flow of the city as well. It's a totally different city when all the students and all the legislators are in town, and in the summer it just gets quiet. Making friends in Tally could be a little more difficult than in Tampa, because of that ebb and flow. You'll meet lots of folks that are only there for four years or so. Tampa area safety is going to be a lot like Orlando. It's a toss up whether I'd feel safer on the OBT or on Ashley Street at 2 in the morning. Tallahassee is kinda weird in that while it does have a "wrong side of town", it also is very mixed. You have sort of rough neighborhoods in the same area as nicer places, restaurant row is two blocks from skid row, the homeless shelter is right down the road from all the best bars and clubs. High crime for a city its size, but mostly because of the youth of the city. Average age is way lower in Tally than in the Tampa metro area.  




 Figuring out what people want is actually...incredibly hard. It's easy if you're taking care of the same 15 people at a small downtown craft-beer heavy bar, but a full-size restaurant in a tourist town is a strange animal. I see my locals, and I talk to them, but most of our cheddar comes from visitors. I have no idea what's hot in the Carolinas right now (where many of my visitors are coming from), in a few months I start getting GA, MS, AL people, and who knows what they want? They often don't know themselves!  Then my yankees, and soon after, my Canadians. It's not just my beer selection to consider, either...I also have to be concerned about liquor and wine, not to mention my menu at large. A lot of it is just guesswork. We listen to requests, but I tell you more often than not, one guy drinks that wine/beer/liquor, and it sits on my shelf. 




 This. All this is my beer philosophy basically. I will never be a biergarten, because I'm a Steakhouse. And we're pretty good at that, but our customer base is changing and not everybody wants BMC. It's our job to offer an option, but it has to be an option that will move, and make people happy. On tap I have Bud, Yuengling, SA seasonal, Stella, and Miller. Thinking about pulling one and featuring something from one of our local brewers. I have bottle Bud, BL, Coors, Miller, Ultra, Corona, Heine, and room for two-three more. That's where I want to fill in some interesting choices...without sitting on inventory. 




 SA Seasonal on the taps. Yuengling on the taps. I can't do Guinness, because I won't fake it with out Nitrogen to push the kegs, and bottles were featured in the past and just didn't sell very well. I'm considering some darker beers for winter, but dark beer plus summer sun plus tourist is a bad idea. 




 I'm a fan of the UFO, I didn't think about that one. 




 I love Florida Cracker, just recently tried it. Can't get it through my current distributors, though. 




 Already have SA Summer on tap. Right next to Blue Moon.  




 Requesting samples of Hazy Sunrise Wheat from my distributor. 




 Killians and Leinenkugel are still favorites of mine...lol. 




 Is that Beach Blonde, from St. Pete? That stuff is amazing. Considering that one too. 




 Yep. Already carry SA Seasonals, and Blue Moon on the taps, have run Shocktop before as a bottle special. 




 Amber bock is one of the beers that was underperforming for us. We pulled it to make room on the tap tower. 




 In our house, priced slightly higher than your local bar.

Doms (bud and miller) $3.50/$2.50 on happy hour.
Imports (Heine, Stella, Corona) $4.50/3.50
Craft beers rotate so it depends on cost, but I try to hit the $6.00/5.00 point. 




 These are all valid points, but going into July-August, I'm stuck with the tourist trade. In this town, that means folks from the Carolinas and mid-florida. I try to keep a few classier beers around for the folks that like to drink Beer (not beer), but I rotate a bottle selection and a tap each two-month period. Right now I have an empty tap, and running down our Small Town's Not Your Fathers Root Beer. What I'm looking to do is have an option where I can coax another buck or two out of those people that are going to want a Bud or a Miller or a  Busch...something light, something yellow, something American...but also something that can benefit those customers that don't want boring beers. Tough call I know. As we get past July-August, my customer base, for lack of a better way of putting it, gets a little "classier", and then I can focus on trending beers, and higher price points, but I have to get through the rest of summer first. 

Though good suggestion on Beer Dinner though...I had debated on doing a prie-fix menu option on the weekends, it would be nice to offer a pairing with wine and one with beer. Thanks for that. 




 Orange creamsicle peaks my interest. I wanted to stay away from the fruity beers, but mainly because everything here on the beach is lemon shandys. We just featured Small Town's Not Your Fathers Root Beer (American ale, 5.9%abv, tastes like frekin' root beer. We do a float with vanilla ice cream and Absolut Vanilla Vodka whipped cream. Yum!) Maybe that's something that might work for us. I'll check my distributors and see. 




 Oh, that's not fair. We have a growing and vibrant craft beer movement here...just not at this particular restaurant. I'm doing my best to change that, but I also have to consider what my customers are already buying and what they will buy. 




 Love OBP and OBP2. That may be what I go to if I can't find something for the July-August people. 




 Lol. Now you get it. Added it on tap and it's moving.  




 That's a good point. Thanks! 




 Yeah, me too. I've done extensive work since taking over here, both on liquors and beers. Great wine list, always had been, but nothing new or innovative with either beer or liquor. Trying to change that for the better. (This month has been Small Town's Not Your Fathers Root Beer. Sold like a barn afire.) 




 We run SA seaonals on tap. They don't sell overly-well, but they are a nice standard on our draft towers. 




 Yuengling is our third best seller, behind Miller and Bud. 




 I thought about a cream ale for the summer. 




 We have had little luck with IPAs here. 




 The summer crowd here on the East coast of Florida are not very beer educated. I need something that will both be acceptable to the "Bud longneck" and "Busch light" crowd, as well as someone with a little more of a "Beer IQ". I've eliminated anything summer fruity like Shandys and Ciders, and looking to hit a price point about a buck more than Bud, Miller, Coors, etc. Any ideas? 




 Get out. You don't want anything to do with that place. Yeah, sure you may grow and get opportunities there; but probably because folks are too wasted to do their jobs well. Things won't get better in a different position. Restaurants survive on teamwork, sounds like there isn't much there.

 Male in a LTO with a woman that looooves the buttsecks. She was very similar to you, uncomfortable but willing to try new things, years later she's a huge fan. There were times that the buttsecks was nasty. It does happen. Not a big deal, we shower together afterwards almost every time anyway. Nowadays, it's just something that happens sometimes, no big deal. IF he's a fan of the butt, and if he's a fan of you, it's not gross, it's not weird, it's just something that happens sometimes, and he'll be cool about it. Now you just gotta feel cool about it. 




 I watched this episode last night on Hulu, I somehow had missed it. I loved the play on "Pet Semetary". That joke is old, though.  














 I filmed two separate parts. On one, action is to the left, on the other, action is to the right. The background remains the same, and the camera placement remains the same, I want the two sources videos to blend into one video that shows both action on the left and right at the same time with the background clear and no fading or transparency issues. Help! 







































 I like the hell outta the Doctors, but they're closer to Arabian Disco than they are to metal. 




 Metal?
 




 Yep. Classy right there. Just down the road from me, like literally about four minutes or so.  

















































 Our holes are on poles.
 









 It sounds like you have a pretty good handle on how you feel about things here, but I'll just share with you this one thought.

You only get that one chance.

If you find later in life some regret, there's nothing you can do about it. If you do walk however, and find that it was not gratifying at all, you're only out time and money.  



















 I'm in. Starting tonight.
 









 Whew. I was almost scared to think of how these changes might affect me, and worse, that I might have had some small part to play in it. But Big Ole Murican Jeesuz told me (through the blessed Tea Party) that I don't have to worry about it....because it's just leftist communist gay marriage proponents faking it up so that we will accept Obama coming dictatorship. What a relief! 




 Oh, if there were only more of you. It's been my experience that for each server like yourself, I've got four that will stand at the bar and bitch about how long their drinks are taking! 




 This is true. But I also share with the folks that I'm training that when you're recovering from a illness, food-bourne or otherwise, you have a compromised immune system.  




 I've worked in this industry for 27 years. I love food service and everything about it. I've worked white tablecloth to family dining to TGIChilibees fast casual. In all that time there has been one hostess that I thought really did a great job 100% of the time. One. 




 Yep. I've seen some terrible terrible things in the meat room. If people knew more about their food I don't think they would ever eat out again. 




 Lol...not all of us do. Mostly I think it's the disconnect in the way people relate to the restaurant. We train our servers to think that the most important thing in the restaurant are the people in their section; they must take care of them at all costs, and we train our chefs and cooks that they are responsible for the entire restaurant at any given time, at least when it comes to food. In that situation you have servers focused on getting a side of whatever for one of their six customers while the kitchen is taking care of 144 guests on the rail...it can get frustrating, and there's little understanding of the other positions plight.
 




 Lol...no. Any problems I have I'm usually sourcing with the suppliers. I get some communications from USDA, as well as FDA, and DOH, mostly regarding any food bourne illness outbreaks, or known contaminants in the food supply. (Think like the recent E-coli contamination of spinach, leeks, radishes, etc over the last couple years.) 




 Yeah....I'm not the best dinner guest.  




 Not as much as you would imagine. Some of the horror stories have been more about bones/cancerous materials in steaks. (Like tumors)
 




 I am a chef/supervisor/food-safety expert for a small chain of steakhouses.  




 Florida is big. North Florida has some really decent remote-ish woods. Florida also has the ocean to the south and east, and the gulf to the west, both excellent places to view. Okeechobee lake in the south is big enough that the center is almost complete city light free.  









 Hard to talk about this without spoiling some stuff for you. 

HIA is two novellas and three short stories. They are all interconnected. 

There is a major character that you need to meet. He figures heavily in one of the novellas, but he also influences some of the things that happen in the other novella and two of the short stories. (Debateable, but yeah) This character is important in the last short story, with another tie-in to the dark tower. (It is not a necessary tie-in, but more of an "a-ha" moment when you achieve resolution with that character.)

So short answer? Read it. Low Men in Yellow Coats, the first novella is a must. Read the rest, because they're good, and connected to LMIYC. Read the last short story for what appears to be a mystery, that later is resolved in the DT series. 

But, that's just, like, my opinion, man. 




 Hearts in Atlantis, at least.
 







































 ummm....thanks for not saying "they're"....whoops. 



















 Restaurant chef/manager here. Hot, standing, bending, running, all damn day long.

1. Shower. Every day before work. (After work too, if you're gross.)
2. Dry dem nuts. Don't dress over wet.
3. Clean clothes. Every time.
4. Some powder. Doesn't seem to matter which kind. I swear by just simple plain corn starch. Others have an unholy fascination with Gold Bond. Try a few, find one you like. Use it, everyday.
5. When you get home,  clean up. Don't go to bed greasy or sweaty. Let that area air out, don't lock everything up in tight whiteys when you get home, get some baggy boxers, and let em breathe, son.

 Don't be swayed; do your research. Dirty is a myth. Uncut is the normal. Google will be your friend...but be advised, my wife and I got wrong information from doctors! 

Here's what I remember:

There is a small decrease in the transmission of some STIs...but it is a small percentage, easily mitigated with the use of condoms, which you would be hopefully teaching, and he will hopefully be using.

The increase in UTIs is real in cut vs uncut...but would you cut  your ear off just to keep it clean? The difficulty for us has just been education our son about how to keep himself clean, and really hasn't been a problem for us.

The cut vs uncut "normal" argument? Well, if he decides later in life, he can certainly elect to get a circumcision while it's quite a bit more difficult to regrow (stretch and cover; google it, it's horrific) his foreskin.

Having a foreskin does have its benefits. Besides being the norm for our body design, it increases sexual pleasure and increases sexual response, both good things for your adult son.

The main thing to remember is that this is a decision between you and your SO. Not friends, not family members, not neighbors. My wife and I are happy with the decision to not circumcise our son, and have had no problems with that, at all, period.  




 Yeah, they can be loud, too.
 




 That sounds like a Mockingbird to me. Late night, 11pm to 3am or so? Call goes through all sorts of different calls, timbres, pitches, etc? [Mockingbirds](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birding/northern-mockingbird/) aren't just making random noises, they are mimicking other bird species. There has been proof in the past that mockingbirds don't just learn from the birds around them either; they learn from other mockingbirds...there have been incidences of mockingbirds mimicking the calls of extinct birds!

 Not at all like an IED went off in her vagina...lol. Just different. The inner labia were just a bit more meaty. Because of an episiotomy (where they make a small incision in the perenium (taint) to ease birth, the general shape of it changed a small amount. If I wasn't already intimately familiar with my wife's vajayjay, I wouldn't think a second about it; it's still beautiful and attractive; just a little different. 




 Not if it's the first time you've been with her. The vag changes after children, for sure, but subtly...I saw the difference first hand with the wife before and after; and it's a visual thing, not a tactile thing. It feels the same, it just looks a little different. But first time out with someone new? No way of telling. 





























 My god, man. I'm so sorry. Persephonee seems like a wonderful girl, I bet she would be so proud of you for deciding to help other people during this time. My heart is just broken for you, bro, just broke. 

I hope you don't mind I share one of your posts from [www.caringbridge.com](http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/persephoneebanks/journal/view/id/54ec56f7a589b4c14e96b3d7) that gives some history. I'm sure others want to know, and maybe want to help out too.

Stay strong, man. From what I read in the Journal on CB, I can't believe how strong you're being; probably strong enough that you and Persephonee's mom can hold each other up, and help each other through this. Far stronger than I can imagine myself being...

This is where I would put something that would help you feel better, if I knew at all what to say...
