 Yea - the hyperbole, or outright BS, in that post was impressive. 




 If Hezbollah could, they would invade Israel. 

Highly doubt that - Israel's existence is the political leverage that parties relying on economically dis-empowered people can use to stay in power.

That said, I don't know why you're being downvoted. HA is a threat to Israel. Not an existential threat, but definitely a long-term threat. 




 Not really, if "nothing happens" and accused terrorists are tried and found guilty before "anything happens", these organizations would look just fine.

Problem is - the only organization with a meaningful record of "thwarted attacks" (the FBI) has constantly been exposed as deliberately entrapping people, re-contextualizing, relying on unreliable sources for false convictions, etc. Meanwhile, what we get from the NSA is massive domestic spying, international spying on allies, while the CIA is busy running black ops toppling democratically elected governments.

Calling for reform isn't an imposition of a catch-22. 




 Right - because condoning torture by our government is just "a different opinion".

Oh wait, you think China and Russia don't do the same?

Basically: Hey, look over there! They do awful shit. So what if we do awful shit as well. 




  some fighters in Iraq and syria ,specially in Is are [a] bunch of wanna be soldiers who played too much games   paintball and decided to go there. 

FTFY 




 Well, I've noticed one thing about terrorist leaders - they seem to live a lot more lives then the rest of us. The key to longevity is somewhere in there.

Sucks for the grunts though - never heard of one of those guys coming back from a suicide bombing. 




  penal colony

Not much worse then one of our prisons making a few cents an hour, getting raped in the US and coming out a more hardened criminal. 




 Banditry without guns never goes over well. 




 People's thoughts are generally tied to things that they're being pumped with as part of their daily routine (interactions with others, the media they consume, etc.) These issues will never get the sort of highlighting that the apparent aggressions of our opponents will, or the new Kanye interview will. 




 That's not how it works, in this country or any others. The most recent example being the child diddlers in the UK government. There is no such thing as karma in the real world. 




 There are some fundamental oversight issues with the way we do things. 




 The CIA and NSA are the good guys, sure they treat terrorists like shit but that's part of why I like them.

God - I really hope you're not actually in the Navy. You're a disgrace to all the men and women who serve and believe in being civilized. 




 I hope that's sarcasm. Because torturing people, meddling in international affairs, creating chaos in relatively stable regions etc. have a direct correlation with "all our childrens" being "blowed up". We've fucked up a lot, but its not irreversible. It requires us to think outside of the box. Like perhaps, not trying to bomb people into submission as that hasn't been mighty effective over the past several years. 




 /s

You forgot that. 




 Not everyone was paying attention, and in 2007ish, there was the common denial of this sort of stuff being rogue elements and not an institutional problem. New information about old abuses is good - it helps catch up people who missed it the first several years over or tried to plausibly deny it because we're all about being 'civilized' and what-have-you. 




 Sadly 




 They're not investigative journalists, they simply report the material that they've come onto (with the same level of scrutiny you'd expect from a standard news report). Investigative reports, documentaries - the only things short of video recordings - that look into issues take a lot more time, but are often based in part on leaks like these. 









 Environment 














 You just posted this - at least give the hasbara trolls a few hours to brigade properly. 




 the killer himself made a link between his acts and Islam.

No. He didn't. Feel free to provide the non-existent citation. 




 Go ahead and talk to the CAIR chapter in your local area...which actually documents hate crimes instead of random people in Reddit. In the past year, where I live, there's been 100 cases of reported acts of vandalism, and outright beatings. Reported attacks - I'm personally aware of people who choose not to report the occasional hate-crime (resulting in tangible material loss) for fear of further harassment.

It must be fun having living under a rock. 




 Pamela Geller, Ayan Hirsi, Fox News. Sorry, yes they are. 




 Did I say that? I asked you a question about your redefining of a well-known term.

Edit: And for the record, I don't. Muslims who live in the West do so under contract, explicit and implicit, in the gaining of visas or citizenship. Whether you're a born or naturalized citizen, these contracts explicitly demand adherence to local laws.

And even if it wasn't explicitly laid out, these actions have a net negative imposition on every other Muslim living in the region - and no extended benefit for Muslims internationally either as the end result is more money pumped into the war machine for further misguided adventures by our government abroad. The objective of a defensive war in Islam is to repel an invasion, not to invite more.

And these actions also don't accord with Islamic law where even for suriyah or out-right war, the individual participants are required to act under a commander.

And that's assuming that your nonsense of attributing a religious motive to this individual in Chatanooga is actually valid when we have no non-circumstantial evidence to believe it is. 




 "muh joos cuntrul le werld XDXDXD"

Not a single comment in this thread even implied that fucktard. 




 Different sub - but holy cow 




 Yes, it's more serious than a normal dog but no where near the ramifications of a human. 

Legally, no. But I can't imagine it won't be a bumpy ride to your cell, or that you won't get James Boyd'ed in the process. 




 If a civilian attacks legitimate military targets, it's terrorism than? So the private security and other volunteers going into Syria right now to fight IS are also 'terrorists' by your definition? 




  Terrorists commit terror in name of Islam --,which this guy did 

Except that he didn't. There's no proven motive yet. 




 President Barrack HUSSEIN Obama wishes happy Eid to the Mozlems on eve of horrific ISIS attack on our soil!!11! 




 Except that no actual IS rep claimed it. An account of a claimed IS fan, with no corroborated or proven connection, claimed responsibility *after the fact*.

Edit: And that random account didn't even claim responsibility. It simply tweeted "Chatanooga" after the fact. 




 there IS a racial component to the issue

Yeah - that racism is allowed to thrive in some departments is a direct result of the blue wall of silence and police corruption. It's a symptom and not the root cause. 

And I wouldn't dismiss the racial **symptom** of it, I'm at the Black Lives Matter rallies. I'm simply saying I don't like the massive re-contextualization of an racial reform issue having to do with *average citizens vs authority* - something I've worked on for years - over the last year. That said, I realize the ship has sailed and that progressive movements will now be focusing primarily on patching up the symptom and not the actual cause, and I'll naturally be part of that struggle as it's better than nothing. 




 Dunno, but I can think of plenty of unarmed white men who've suffered police brutality and died as a result. 




 That's not even what I implied. The fact that racism is allowed to thrive in some departments is a direct symptom of the blue wall of silence and police corruption. Root causes of this issue that effect all groups of people. Not the other way around. We're now focus on remedying one of the symptoms and not the actual cause. 




 It is a race issue if anything is.

That's simply not true. Racism being allowed to thrive in some departments is a direct symptom of the blue wall of silence and police corruption. Not the other way around. 




 That's not true. Those same people used to rally for white victims of police brutality. Fox brought tons of them out with guns, using their children as human shields, to support the criminals at Bundy ranch.

By re-contextualizing, we've given people who lack the ability to empathize with people different from them, a way to justify their racism as simply being support for law enforcement. And instead of having an issue that affects all of us be reformed, we have half the country (hyperbole) opposed to reform as a result. 




 Bootlickers are gonna be bootlickers. 

Those bootlickers are bootlickers because they are unable, based on their upbringing, to empathize with the black high school drop out. Those same bootlickers were railing in favor of Bundy against the government, and various other white 'criminals' that faced off against cops.

We function in a democracy and need to cater to the lowest common denominator when we push for any sort of reform - if we want it to be universal. And unfortunately, because of the way this conversation has now irreversibly been characterized, instead of average citizen vs authority issue, it's now a black suspect vs white authority issue. 




 Derailing? I've been documenting police brutality for several years... If anything, the new contextualization derailed from a universal problem. To focus on the more central problems of the blue wall of silence, police corruption, and police abuse isn't victim blaming... Racism being allowed to thrive in some departments is just a symptom of the blue wall of silence, not the cause. 




 To focus on the more central problems of the blue wall of silence, police corruption, and police abuse. Racism being allowed to thrive in some departments is just a symptom of the blue wall of silence, not the cause.

Then again - it's too late. The issue of police brutality has already been framed into an almost exclusively race-based one by our own movements and media at this point. 




  The police shoot members of both races, although I agree the blacks suffer from this more. 

It's a shame, by turning this into a race issue, people have inadvertently led to more blind support for law enforcement abuses by more conservative voters. When in truth, police brutality is something we are ALL affected by. By making the issue into a race one, we've killed the possibility of reform in some of the places that need it most. 




 You're getting downvoted, but that's the truth. Saddam kept people in line, and contrary to popular opinion, had Shi'ites and Christians in his government. 




 I don't pretend to understand what is happening in the Mid East, but to me, it just seems like a long road of endless violence. 

I understand what's happening in the Middle East. That's exactly what it is. 




 At least our military industrial complex will continue pumping away. Too bad for all the people who died and will die in the coming years :( 




 Here's a Sunni polemicist site (pacifist missionary style):

http://twelvershia.net/

If you read any of the articles, the main difference is entirely theological.

The current issues, that lead to killings on both sides, have nothing to do with theology though. It's an issue of political alignment with political leaders using religious adherants as pawns.

If you go back to the root of the modern violence, you can go back to the Saffavid dynasty when modern Twelver Shi'ism became a major religious group within Islam due to the ethnic cleansing of Iran of the then Sunni majority under Shah Ismail. And again at the Islamic Revolution in Iran when Khomayni created a new concept in Twelver Shi'ism called Waliyat al Faqih - turning Shi'is to a more active politicized, as opposed to Messianic, religion. This in turn meant meddling in foreign affairs (Iran supported rebellions in Iraq and elsewhere), etc. If it had remained a theological dispute - as it was long ago at many points in time, the worst case scenario today would be zealots and missionaries denouncing one another. 




 Everything coincides with these days over there - as it's a way to taunt your enemy. Saddam Hussein for instance, was executed on the day Sunnis were celebrating Ei'd by the Shi'ite government in Iraq. 




 Depends on the location and the role. A tenured cop that got promoted can make more in 10 years than the average citizen in mid-level, non-executive management (80-120K). 




 I feel like stuff like this must happen, though very rarely. We probably just don't hear much about it - like the domestic terrorist who flew a plane into the IRS building. 




 Their enemies haven't ever played by the rules either. We're not fed that side of the story because then we realize it's not black and white, and there really aren't any "good guys" in this fight. [NSFW](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6f2_1404371007) 




 Even the semi-sane ones know not to be taken prisoner - nobody there is following international law. NSFW links below:

 That's not true, YPG unlike the Shi'ite army and militias aren't known for torturing prisoners or patrolling with corpses on their vehicles. 




 This isn't a confirmed figure from a reputable source...just a blog post and Leith has been known to exaggerate in the past... 




 It's a four year course, Bagdaddy finished in one! 




 This brings me a lot of comfort. If we are just a computer program there is a chance of an afterlife program.

It shouldn't. If we're just going on the chance that there is an afterlife, there's no reason to believe that it will be in any way a comforting after life. Could be endless physical suffering. 




 Every account of him from his friends has him described as 'nice if you get to know him', 'introverted', 'not one of the popular kids, but polite', etc. He may have had a small clique of friends, that doesn't mean he's well-adjusted or didn't face the sort of discrimination his sister spoke out against a few years ago.

To have a tongue in cheek joke about discrimination as the defining statement of your high school career is a good indication that at the very least he was familiar with such incidents, if not intimately and personally so. Likewise, his dad was wrongly detained for questioning by the FBI at a point in his life. His siblings worked to tackle Islamaphobia in the region. Everything is indicative of his experience with discrimination.

That said, you can't expect a CNN piece focusing on this single aspect of the kid's development. They'd get crucified for "blaming the victims" for at least a good year before somebody has the wherewithal, greed and motivation to write a book or serious piece about the issue. 




 They don't need aircraft carriers to be drowned by their enemy...they obviously had to cross the Tigris when they wanted to attack beyond Anbar before they lost Tikrit, not to mention they controlled several dams... 




 By all accounts, he was a popular kid 

Now you're just making shit up. Every account of him from his friends has him described as 'nice **if you get to know him**', 'introverted', 'not one of the popular kids, but polite', etc. He may have had a small clique of friends, that doesn't mean he's well-adjusted or didn't face the sort of discrimination his sister spoke out against a few years ago. He even made a crude joke about discrimination for his heritage as part of his yearbook signature. Well-assimilated kids don't need to do that where assimilation by definition lends to them identifying with the culture they developed in.

Why is it that when you see something like this, your immediate reaction is a classist anti-southerner screed?

Because by all accounts, he was a mal-adjusted kid in a state of inbred Fox News fans.

Not prejudice. Records of anecdotal incidents of discrimination, the sort of rhetoric by popularly elected representatives, and how the majority of districts vote, are all a pretty clear indication of what sort of place TN is with the exception of isolated pockets. 




 Ding Ding Ding 




 Except that Fox News quite literally isn't real news. They don't even self-classify as an actual news outlet. It's why they're able to get away with the bullshit they spin. 




 Nobody said everybody who faces discrimination becomes a terrorist. Same way, not everybody who gets molested as a kid becomes a serial killer. All I pointed out was that these experiences do play a role in the development of antisocial behavior. This is basic psychology. But pretending that past interactions don't shape the future perspectives of people, and boiling complex issues to simple black and White hyperbole would indicate that you don't have the intellectual capacity to have a reasoned discussion on the topic. So I'm out. Have a wonderful life. 




 I feel like the govt should subsidize hookers for engineering departments, as like a once monthly thing. Would really help clear away bad thoughts and isolation and whatnnot. 




 Jeez - I can't even imagine being that Boston bomber's sister. 




 She did. It's not about not knowing him, people change over time. You can tell from his joke in the highschool yearbook that he's probably used to plenty of abuse from authority as a result of his heritage. It's not difficult to see years of being outcast by your peers in bumbfuck TN being a leading cause in your outlook and development. 




 I know of children under 3 being put on terror watchlists (and later being removed). What you cited means literally nothing, except proving the exact antithetical point to what you're implying by the fact that the man was ultimately removed. 




 He has a reasonable defense in court, true or not. He saw this car smoking and began filming innocuously. He then considered helping the victims - prompting him to lean into the car. However, you realized the issue was beyond his scope of expertise so he ceased trying to help and simply continued filming. 




 People often hate on cops, and sure there is a real issue with the blue wall of silence, but what they don't seem to realize is that the real villains are in the legislature. 




 This isn't even about bad cops. This is about corruption among city officials - which led to these cops, good or bad, quitting. I don't know how anyone can spin it different. 




 Nah, by getting this unpopular decision out of the way now, they ensure that people won't remember it years down. Democracies have voters with short attention spans and even shorter memories. 




  I swear politics now days is a game: Get in, make as much money as you can for you and your mates, then retire.

It's always been a game of thrones. The future will be shit, just like the past. 




 Your MPs rape little children. Haven't seen much striking over that. 




 It won't be good. You should get local police at wherever you guys do your holiday prayers at. 




 The people that do, like Russel Brand for instance, have no meaningful role in media or politics. 




 I would need to see the video - I didn't even realize they had a drowning / det cord ones. But I imagine something similar (you sank our ship, etc.)

 Ah - that explains it. They're not being unAmerican, they're just patriotic conscientious objectors. Let's throw away these pitch forks and signs about the 1% 




  Especially since the Iraq war gained us exactly nothing.

Not true. We got a shit ton of contracts for Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Haliburton, and various other firms that are part of the military industrial complex. We also created quite a few jobs. Not to mention we've led to that region becoming epically fucked and unstable - ergo -  more contracts for our private military companies.

And who knows, maybe 10 years down the road, a puppet government - hopefully less subservient to Iran and more to us - will be kind enough to allow our private civil corporations to rebuild that shithole. 




 Haaretz is one of the few *reasonable* papers they print in Israel. Everything else is the sort of right-wing drivel and Israeli fear-propaganda you expect people like OP to post. 




 You won't lose nudity, that can be really profitable for them in the long run. You may/will lose BDSM/rape/bestiality/humiliation/etc. subs. 




 I wonder what the next big execution thing will be. Pulling people apart? Feeding them alive to hungry feral dogs? They seem to have tried and overdone themselves time and time again.

For the creative ones - They base their executions on the nature of the 'crime' of the person they're executing. So if you're thinking about the Jordanian, he was burnt alive and then burried under rubble because he was accused of being complicit in doing that to 'citizens' of IS as a bomber pilot. Bombs incinerate their victims or cover them in rubble (as apartments get toppled). So I don't think they'll be employing feral dogs anytime soon in their short blip in history. 




 Nope. In Iraq, the Sunnis and Shi'ites under Saddam weren't racially/ethnically disprate. There were even large tribes with both Sunnis and Shi'ites. The exception was in the mostly Shi'ite South, but you can't tell the difference between somebody from Basra and someone from Tikrit. After the Iranian revolution, and the Iran supported rebellions within Iraq, there obviously wasn't as much cohesion between Sunni Arab and Shi'ites. That said though, 30-40 years of angst isn't going to change generations of common ethnic background - so they still look pretty alike.

Now if you take an Iranian (mostly Shi'ite) and a Pakistani or an Afghan (mostly Sunni), you'll notice huge differences. And in Afghanistan your theory would actually hold since Shi'ism is more the cultural religion of Hazara who are ethnically seperate from the others. 




 What's funny is that before the media frenzy about ISIS, I had posted videos of everything from torture of Sunnis captured by Shi'ite militias (outright torture celebrated on camera), burning people alive, using corpses as decals on jeeps, etc.

People think ISIS came out of nowhere, or that they're some great evil we need to go out there and defeat. We need to stop fucking around in their deserts, there's no "good guys" out there. 









  He inherited 40-200m, maybe he lost most of it but he's worth 10 billion now...not everyone can make that happen without getting lucky and making the right business decisions.

He's not worth 10 Bn. Probably not even close to that. Forbes, and countless other parties have contested his claims (in some cases - itemized contestations) 




 Any proof that he **recently** expressed support for universal healthcare or expanding 'Obamacare'? 



















 What about Aether? 




 Instituted Urdu over them? Hardly. If you don't have a medium language, Sindhis and Punjabis can't say shit to one another. That Urdu (and English of late) are medium languages is out of requirement of needing *something* to be mutually intelligible to other people in the same damn country. 




 It's a medium language, how English is in most of the world. Everybody speaks other languages, but they need Urdu/English to communicate with people from other regions. 




 I disagree. US media is actual shit. Yours is still, like piss or something. 




 Yes, because rape fixes everything. Let me guess, you're a middle aged white American. 




 Not really. All it takes is time, and growth. If this kid was kept on a watch and never allowed to make way into Syria, 3 years of simply living in a truly inclusive society (another problem in the UK) - and he could've ended up a productive tax-paying citizen.

He's gonna come out a proper criminal now, he'll still lose the fanaticism, but it won't be a beneficial result for the general populace. 




 Also totally cool in WA, way before the Supreme Court decision. 




 Come to Seattle, there's a lot to do till pretty late. Some spots still going till like 5 AM 




 Fuck yea. Let's secede? We've been carrying all this weight like.. 




 Yep, it fails to be mutual at that point. 




 Yep, but be careful with that. When they're drunk and they got a pussy, you're getting booked. 




 It's mutual combat in WA, not a street fight. If one person calls quits, its no longer mutual, so it would be a cheap shot and a basis to argue damages. Of course there's no reason to really believe that happen here. 




 So I haven't used /r/loans in like a year. I come back and all of a sudden new page w/ improvements. Nice.. 




 Actually, I dont understand what you are saying. Sorry to be dense, but the death of Jesus by crucifixion is established history by historians. Islam denies this. That is all I claimed in my comment. 

You said, "Islam rejects that Jesus died on the cross even though this is considered to be a historical fact by scholars."

I'm saying that your statement is disingenuous as there are secular historians who believe that the historical Jesus either never existed, or that the Canonical Gospel accounts of Jesus' life/death aren't relevant to the historical Jesus. If Jesus, as described in the canonical gospels, did not exist - Jesus, as described in the canonical gospels, was not crucified.

Likewise, its disingenuous in that, of the secular scholars who believe in a historical Jesus, there are historians who don't believe he was crucified either. They've proposed other modes of natural death and execution.

Given these two issues, contrasting Islamic and mainstream Christian theology, while saying something is considered to be a "historical fact" "by scholars" carte-blanche isn't reasonable. In the same vein, I can say "[Mainstream] Christianity believes that Jesus rose from the dead even though this is considered a myth by scholars. Islam and [Mainstream] Christianity are very different"

Although evangelicals love making this particular appeal to authority - **it's just not an academically honest thing to bring up - in the context of theology**, and can be easily applied to mainstream Christians - was my point.

Also - side note, one of the principles (rejection) used in the past by some secular historians to conclude that Jesus was likely crucified isn't that strong, particularly in the last 50 or so years - especially with the discovery of Nag Hammadi. The particular Nag Hammadi texts that contradict the crucifixion (btw) are non-Basilidian texts that provide an additional sectarian confirmation of Basilides' theology re:crucifixion (a denial of crucifixion by a subset of early Christians which was known primarily through polemics by Ireneus/Origen/etc. against Basilides). 




 Islam rejects that Jesus died on the cross even though [the idea that Jesus died in one way or another] ~~this~~ is considered to be a historical fact by ~~scholars~~ [historians who believe Jesus existed].

Christianity teaches that Jesus rose from the dead several days later even though this is considered a historical fabrication by historians who believe Jesus existed.

See what I did there? Relevance of a historians analysis, based on the reality of death in the human experience, on theology... 




 Let's leave aside that example - there's tons of examples that the Law wasn't temporally universal for the Jews. There are passages where God himself orders people to wipe out entire towns (down to every living thing) and there are other passages where God prohibits taking innocent lives.

Israel was carrying out Gods judgment on specific nations who practiced idolatry, sexual immorality, and child sacrifice, so many innocent lives were already being taken. There were rules that they had to follow. They had to offer the city terms of surrender, so the people knew ahead of time that Israel was coming. Only those who didnt leave were killed. They allowed the Canaanites to assimilate into Israel if they were willing. When Israel practiced the same sins as the other nations, God judged them too.

You don't need to defend the fact that the OT God was ordering genocidal raids against idolators' cities down to every breathing thing, etc. My point was that God not only allowed, but ordered mass killings in certain circumstances. Other times, God changed it to prohibit victimization of the innocent civilians. I'm not bringing up the morality/barbarity associated with something like this - my point was that you object to the idea that * Something is okay one day, and not okay the next * - but the Bible is replete with examples of this. Examples which you have no trouble reconciling in the Bible but find adamantly problematic in Islamic concept of abrogation.

Im not sure what you are trying to show with this link.

The link was a response to what you said: the Quran is supposed to be the next revelation confirming what was revealed before in the Torah and the Gospel.

I was pointing out that this isn't what is intended, but rather confirming (what is true) from what is left of past books and *correcting* what is false from the past books is the objective.

You claim the Quran corrects the previous revelation. Since weve been discussing...

I'll take it than you have no interest in the Qur'anic corrections of Biblical factual errors (as in the link) as you would rather address other items besides that (which is fine)...

 marriage/adultery/mutah, was Jesuss teaching on divorce a corruption?

I wouldn't know if Jesus' purported teaching on divorce are a corruption or not. Let's assume that his teachings **to the Children of Israel**, for whom he was sent, were not a corruption.

Considering that Muhammad allowed sex with slaves, sex with captive women while their husbands were still alive... I can only assume that Muhammad was correcting Gods previously corrupted revelation.

Jesus never prohibited either of these things - even in what's remained of the corrupted revelations. Having sex with slaves never fell under adultery for the Old Testament God and Jesus never came along and suggested that it is now adultery or slavery is now abolished (the opposite, slaves ought to obey their masters per Christ's purported disciples - Titus 2/9), or that it has become prohibited as part of his new laws...

and married his adopted sons wife after a divorce

Wouldn't be a problem with Jewish law, though in your hypothetical, if we assume that Jesus' teachings were not just for Jews, but for Gentiles, and that Jesus' teachings prohibit divorce, than it would be problematic. That's two assumptions we don't necessarily buy.

Ummm..it sure did!! In fact, you are commanded to tell me you believe in what has been revealed to me (29:46), not some ghost Christian from around the time of Christ. Will you obey the Quran?
As above - [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/2zgomi/where_is_muhammad_mentioned_in_the_bible/cpkdocd)

One of the benefits of having so many manuscripts is we know **no one person** could have tampered with the texts, especially the NT.

Except that they did, unless you're suggesting that ample examples like John 7:53 (onwards) were made by a group of people. This passage, like many other passages, was inserted at some point. For Christians spanning wide physical and temporal regions (literally centuries) - this was canon - they were duped by the surviving MS family into believing that this was a part of the Gospel attributed to John. Until the discoveries of some early John MS' + Sinaiticus (about 200 years ago), etc.

So for centuries, interpolations (such as this one) are able to creep on by *in spite of* the many manuscripts that pre-date these discoveries and improve our understanding of what was actually originally in these texts.

If you're suggesting that no one person alone could've tampered with the text, sure. Instead, many different people with different reasons over different periods of time were able to tamper with the text. And this is just the evidence of tampering in late manuscript families (leading to the widespread propagation of different interpolations which are uncovered only as discoveries are made). There aren't actually any full MS that are contemporary with the purported authors - making early interpolations pretty practicable as well.

 




 No wories. 

Whether it is God directly or God through a prophet, Im not sure I understand the difference.

The difference is that in the history of OT, the particular phrase "God will go" was used to mean the selection of a Prophet. It has never, in the history of the OT to my recollection, meant that God Himself arrives in an avatar (Jesus). You can't on the one hand demand Muslims mentioning Isaiah 42 embrace the context of both Proto and Deutro Isaiah while yourself ignoring the context of these Jewish phrases you're re-interpreting to apply to Christ.

In our example (Hosea 2), the the text is clear. It says God will go to the gentiles. From the context of the OT, it implies that God will select a Gentile Prophet. But you're suggesting a revolutionary meaning outside of the OT context, that this time around, the scripture actually means God will himself come down in human form as an *Israelite* and that the *Israelite* will go to the Gentiles. Can you find one single verse in the OT where this phrase is used and *not meant* that God will select a Prophet *from* the group He's "going to"?

Im surprised you would bring this up. Pointing out that a sect does not adhere to the majority has no bearing on what the truth is.

Absolutely does. You don't hold a monopoly over interpretation. The fact that different subsets of Christians, with largely the same canon at this point, are coming to multiple interpretations using the same text implies ambiguity. Ambiguity allows for interpretation (as opposed to one irrevocable interpretation in "truth").

...

I take my interpretation from Scripture. I cant help if others ignore what Jesus said. 

As above. You take your interpretation from your understanding of what you take as scripture. Another person can interpret  your version of the same text to derive that divorce is completely illegal, or that divorce itself is okay, but remarriage is not, etc. The texts are not clear or there wouldn't be such disparity amongst several subsets of the population that have, more or less, the same scripture. 

And then if we look at the textual integrity of the verse - given that the MS evidence suggests that "except for fornication" is an interpolation, you open a whole new can of worms (making it clear that divorce is never permitted - contradicting your view which is based on a certain subset of our manuscripts). One of the problems associated with the myriad of "minor" MS discrepancies is that they often effect meaning.

Requiring this is a double standard since there are also varying interpretations of things within Islam.

Requiring what? Islamic law, like Jewish law, is open to varying interpretations. This is intrinsically consistent with what the source texts themselves say about multiple interpretations.

All that being an aside however. The main point you were making (as I gather it) is that it makes sense for Jesus to abrogate some/all of the Law because your reading of Paul's interpretation of these passages is that the laws were prophesied to be cancelled?

I quoted the OT, not Paul.

You quoted Jeremiah 31. That doesn't mean your interpretation of Jeremiah 31 isn't influenced by your reading of Paul's suggestion of 'the law in spirit' and not reading Jeremiah as its own text.

I could qoute the Bahagavad Gita to make a point that no Hindu had ever understood from the passage, and which the context and language of the passage doesn't support based on the later supplemental texts. That doesn't mean its what the Gita implies.
But if you find offense to that, we can simplify,  *The main point you were making (as I gather it) is that it makes sense for Jesus to abrogate some/all of the Law because your ~~reading of Paul's~~ interpretation of these passages is that the laws were prophesied to be cancelled?*

There is nothing morally wrong with how someone plants a field of crops or if they mix fabrics, unless someone is doing this in the context of idolatry. 

But who are you to decide what is and is not morally wrong though? If you believe in an Objective Morality, you need a fundamental source to fix that morality. If that source is God, than what God says you should do becomes moral, and what God says you shouldn't do becomes immoral. As you say yourself, "Adultery has always been morally wrong, at least according to Christianity **when God set up marriage.**"

You can justify mutah by saying that its not really adultery since they were technically married and Moses also permitted divorce; however, this is where Jesus calls out the Israelites saying that they even though the Israelites were technically following the law, their hearts were far from the things of God.

I'm not justifying mut'ah. It's prohibited.

If Muhammad was a prophet from God, why did his life and Gods newest revelation contradict the prior revelations?

Where's the contradiction? The Christians haven't (re-)discovered Q - and that's assuming Q is even an accurate reflection of Christ's actual teachings. There are no accurate reflections of prior revelation in existence per Islamic text, in spite of the evangelically forced misinterpretation of one or two ayaat, as mentioned to you by someone in a different thread. Edit: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/2zgomi/where_is_muhammad_mentioned_in_the_bible/cpkdocd)

Jesus was showing what the intention of the law was.

Right, that's semantics. The fact is that he changed the law. Divorce was okay, with OT examples, one day and not okay the next (abrogation). You can say it was just Jewish hypocrisy, but the OT God seemed to lay out a lot of material that suggest that divorce, re-marriage after divorce and polygamy were allowed in more circumstances than just adultery.

 No, it doesn't. But instead of spouting the tired reductionist BS, why not [actually look into](http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/) and let us know what you find.[2](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2zzy13/uk_government_rejects_immunity_for_public/cpnv677) [3](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2zzy13/uk_government_rejects_immunity_for_public/cpny2yt) 



















  I heard from people who stayed in the village that [militiamen] were burning down houses, looting and blowing up houses. I went back last week, approximately 10 days ago, because our financial situation is poor and I needed to collect our belongings, especially as winter is coming. When I got there I saw that 99 percent of the houses in my neighborhood were burnt down and nothing was left. While I was there we saw smoke rising from three different places. The smoke was coming from the areas in front of my house, near the main road near the militia offices. The school was burnt down too, and they burnt three [hospital] clinics and four mosques.

This is "liberation" apparently. 




 No, I'm sorry for being abrasive, I can see where the incorrect assumption would've been made based on the translation. 




 Alleged mediums are often women and people of color.

Maybe in America. I can't speak for Afghanistan specifically, but in these areas specifically (neighboring Muslim countries), the fortune teller stands are predominantly run by men. Soothsayers in our countries in this region are open about it, it's not something you're accused of and killed for - regardless of whether they're just bogus entrepreneurs. You're applying an American experience (Salem) to a completely different society. 




 Of course they are, it's extremely naive and arrogant of you to think that there are not people that are unsure that identify as muslims in this subreddit. Having a mature debate about it would be nice, but you are clearly so uncertain in your own belief that you felt intimidated by just the prospect of discussion about it

LOL. Well that escalated quickly. Peace. 




 It's not about it not being mature. I'd be interested in the topic too, but you need to find someone actually "considering leaving Islam" - and I'm sure they're out there, but the people in this sub (usually Muslims and non-Muslims with substantial interest in Islam) aren't the demographic you're going for. 




  Old footage mostly.

Exactly what I was thinking. Re-using a bunch of old clips you pushed out before the initiative doesn't really imply a lot of success. 




 It's not a baby or a fetus falling out of her womb....it's one his two kids that went up to her after she died.....

...   ... 




 That's not talking about a fetus falling out of her...it's one of his two children () coming up and getting splashed with some of her blood.  




 If she is pregnant, yes. But where is this idea of a pregnancy coming from? 




 a pregnant woman

How the Hell did you get that she was pregnant? 




 So by your logic we should ignore textual criticism; a secondary document affirming the Trinity, and the progression of Jesus's mission starting with the Jews then the Gentiles?

We were talking about **the textual integrity of a specific verse** you used, not Trinitarian doctrine in general...and your response is to bring up an unrelated issue and defend the unrelated issue...okay... 




 Here you will find the answer to al-Kheoi

The guy defending Khoi's argument boils down to 'There is a difference b/w plain lying and lying for a cause..' - confirming the fatwa and contradicting your original claim....

The evidence about the absurd nature of your cult - it's distance from the religion sent by Al-Haqq and the garbage you've attributed to the Imams AS, is there for your benefit in both fatawa and ahadith. Being a little honest with yourself won't hurt. Salaam 




 Sure, I can provide two examples off-hand, the prophecy about the volcanic event in Hijaz and a prophecy about the Mongol Invasion.

Re: the volcanic event, he mentioned that people as far as  Busra will observe the light from it. So he mentioned not only the event - but even the magnitude of the unforeseeable event in no uncertain terms. [This hadith](http://www.sahihmuslim.com/sps/smm/sahihmuslim.cfm?scn=dspchaptersfull BookID=41 ChapterID=1209) is in Sahih Muslim (261 AH) while the event took place around 600 AH.

As for the Mongol invasion, the Prophet explicitly laid out the racial characteristics and even the type of clothing of the invaders. [The hadith (179-180 and other recordings)](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/052-sbt.php) is in Sahih Bukhari (200 AH) while the event took place in like 650 AH.

One especially remarkable feature, besides the detailed recorded statements about appearance 600 years prior to the event, is that he couldn't possibly know that Islam wouldn't spread to the Mongols - which would've falsified the prophecy (as the tradition implies a non-Muslim army coming in). Muslim armies also had never provoked the Mongols afaik so there was no possibility of self-fulfillment either. The Mongol armies had to stop their infighting, unite, and then succeed against China before progressing to the Muslim empires. We're dumbing it down here - but the level of complexity and the number of variables is pretty out there. 




 Let me know what statements in particular you'd like a citation for or found to be "a load of BS" - happy to provide any information you need. 




 I wouldn't know about your lab and I'm not a biologist. My point of reference is popular information about a handful of studies, like the one where they ran a social experiment on mice populations to the point of over-populating a limited space and where the animals began to exhibit abnormal behaviors (until the population ended up dying out). 




 [Reply 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/198xye/from_the_heart_to_the_heart_a_letter_to_the/c8m8gjq)

We'll tackle this first. My claim is that a central premise of your religion is **lying**, contrary to Islam. That your religious traditions have denigrated the Imams (AS) as nothing but habitual, and **needless liars**. And though the claim of your religion, through your version of the Imamah nonsense, is that the Imams are meant to be guides, they (rather their purported followers) generated more misguidance and confusion than guidance.

The premise of your defense is:

Taqiiya is only done when someone's life is at risk

And then you quote an out-of-context Sunni scholar's explanation of taqiyyah as it would be permissible in Islam, and try to extend his definition to your own cult. This is illogical. Your religion doesn't come from our scholars - if you have a defense of taqiyyah being what you claim it is, that defense should come from your texts. Not to mention that your disingenuous sources deliberately took Waheed uz Zaman's statements out of context.

Here's why I'm confused though, Grey - since I'm actually reading the fatwas of your scholars to learn about your religion - and your ahadith. You keep telling us that taqiyyah is only to save your life, that lying isn't okay otherwise. I agree with you, that is what **Islam teaches**. But it doesn't seem to be what your religion teaches, and it doesn't seem to be what your religious traditions suggest that the Imams RA did.

(1) If that was the case, why did al-Khoi give this fatwa:

He is explicitly allowing Twelvers to lie to Sunnis (or any non-Twelver) in debate if it means the Twelver will win the argument. Can you explain why al-Khoi, a venerated mujtahid of your cult would come to this conclusion while you - an anonymous nobody - has more claim to what is and is not allowed in your religion when practicing taqiyyah? This fatwa, and your claim contradicting it, has really confused me! Was al-Khoi just unaware that you can't do taqiyyah in munazarra?

(2) A similar sentiment is echoed by al Khomayni in his rasael:

            

[and again:]

           

He is explicitly allowing Twelvers, in one of the permissible types of taqiyyah, to lie in order to trick Sunnis simply so that Sunnis will be drawn in. This is not preservation of life and limb - it's outright deceit.

(3) A similar fatwa from as-Shirazi explaining how taqiyyah IS NOT what you're claiming it to be and IS allowed even without threat to life - but just to spread your cult (from Qawaid al Fiqhiya):

                                         .            

Over and over, I'm finding your major scholars permitting taqiyyah without fear of loss. Maybe you can clarify the statements above?

(4) I have some copy-pasta of my own from when I began to learn about your religion. [Shiachat thread](http://www.shiachat.com/forum/topic/234993616-ameen-after-fatiha/page-2). The people there are generally more knowledgable about their cult than most people on Reddit so I'll add details I omitted + clarification here. Imam told his followers to say Ameen out-loud after fatiha (hadith saheeh):

    (   )           :    :     

As you know however, in your religion there is no 'Ameen' after the Fatiha. And your books have saheeh traditions which suggest that you not only don't need to, but should NOT say 'Ameen' after the fatiha. The contradiction is easily resolved though. The Imam in one case is doing taqiyyah, and in the other case, he's telling the truth in secret to his Shi'a. Fair enough.

My issue however is that your definition of taqiyyah only allows people to lie when their life is threatened. This means that the Imam's life must've been threatened.

Here's the problem with that theory. In Sunni fiqh, there are different opinions on the Ameen. We all say it, but some say it out-loud (like Hanbalis) while others say it silently (like Hanafis). The Imam was in Hanafi territory. If he feared for his life, why did his false fatwa in taqiyyah match the fiqh position of non-Hanafis? This fatwa from the Imam, and your claim contradicting it, has really confused me! Was the Imam just unaware that you can't do taqiyyah except when your life is threatened? Why is the Imam misguiding us?

(5) And speaking of misguidance + useless lying, maybe you can explain this sahih hadith from al-Kafi to me:

                        :                            :                      :   !                   .
:      :               :    .

If taqiyyah is out of fear of life or limb, why is the Imam giving us **three unique fatwas (2 lies, 1 correct fatwa)**? The Imam explains that its better to confuse people so they don't rely on one another... is this what you've denigrated the holy progeny (AS) to? Absolutely repulsive. As an aside, your religion teaches us that we need Imamah so that we have **guides** who will explain the religion. If the Imams were such habitual liars who caused deliberate confusion, doesn't it kinda kill the whole purpose of Imamah?

---
I would like an absolute consensus on this issue, like how there is in shunning terrorism, or anything major like this.

This is not a major issue. The fact that your cult is sizable is a modern phenomenom. In spite of this, prominent scholars have already commented on the Imami religions that came well before your version was popularized...

Whatever happened to facing consequences like a man, guessing Wahhabis aren't blessed with this basic trait.

No, I guess they haven't. They learned from the best though. Your imaginary cave-boy Mahdi taught them that key to longevity is hiding...

honestly it makes your Sahaba (as per your history, **not my opinion**, nor my claim)

No reason to mince your words, this thread is old enough that nobody else will see it...

As for reading your copy-paste (which is just copy-pasta from AA - I was silly enough to hope for something original and unaddressed), I did, and I'd be happy to address the unrelated parts re:Uthman once you've clarified my misunderstandings about the basis of your religion: Lying. 




 So if you can kill animals in order to eat meat and make tents, i.e., to benefit a handful of people, then a priori, you can kill animals in order to benefit an entire population of people. 

Killing animals isn't the same as torture. And if we're real about - a lot of these experiments are torture - and some of the things that bring us "progress" are outright disgusting. 




  It kind of sounds like you're putting limits on God's mercy. 

Ultimately, it is up to God and we'll never know what's in somebody's heart. But as a general rule, the texts are clear that Islam is the only religion excepted. I agree with what you're implying - we can't truly fathom the extent of God's mercy and what He'll treat as the 'mustard seed of iman' - but we know what the general statement is (and in turn - the importance of dawah). 




 Whoa there bro! Can you be any more biased in explaining the sunni viewpoint? You didn't even make an attempt at explaining it. A naive reader will read your post and think that sunnis believe Allah (swt) has hands and feet like humans, Audubillah. 

The most amusing part of that statement is the reality that tajseem was introduced to Muslims through Hisham b al-Hakim, an Imami Shi'ite. Twelvers may have taken a more Mutazilli route over the years, but there's a good bit of irony there to chuckle at. 




 For me, it's prophecy. I just can't explain away bounds of clear-cut Prophet statements that were put to paper before the events took place. I'm not talking Nostradamus style prophecy, or how Christians contort symbolic OT verses into prophecies about Jesus - I'm not talking about self-fulfilling prophecies - but like, real, literal prophetic statements - many times many years into the future. Falsifiable statements that a false prophet would never have made. 




 My premise is more like if a Sunni and Shia Muslim lived together for 2 years in a college dorm, what differences would they notice day to day?

If you want to know basic differences in fiqh - you'll want to pick a comparative fiqh primer. I would suggest this one:

http://www.amazon.com/Islamic-Jurisprudence-According-Sunni-Schools/dp/1887752978

And then for Imami fiqh, I would recommend man la yadhurul faqih (you'll need to understand Arabic). This is technically a hadith book (since Shi'ites consider the words of an Imam as a hadith) but it's designed as a fiqh book. If you read them comparatively, you'll notice that Imami Shi'ites often have contradictory authentic traditions (like in nikah al mut'a or saying ameen after fatiha) where one matches a popular Sunni opinion and another is aberrant. The general logic is that the aberrant opinion is the correct one for Shi'ites and the one that matches Sunnis was said by the Imam in taqiyyah.

If you speak Urdu - which I gather from your post, see if you can find a comparative fiqh book by Mufti Abdul Kareem Mushtaq. I haven't read it so I can't comment on the content, but my understanding is he compares the majority opinion in the four madhahib of Sunnis and the major opinions of Twelver Shi'ites.

There are tons of differences though you'll notice in the minutiae if you're both religious. The basis of Imami Shi'ism was to be anti-thetical to whatever the 'aam (majority) were doing. In the case of fiqh, this translated to doing the opposite of the major school of Sunni fiqh in your city - and that became the basis for the narrations that Imamis have in their books which aren't found in the books of traditional Islamic sects (Sunnis, Zaydi Shi'ites, Ibadis, etc.)

As an example, Hur Amili said:

               **           **

Basically, Sunni scholars were so misguided by Shaitan that it became a rule in Twelver Shi'ism to simply do the opposite of what the Sunnis did.

Hopefully that helps in whatever you're trying to study. 




 If it wouldn't be considered effeminate in your culture and among the people you surround yourself with, there shouldn't be a problem. One of the sons of Imam Ahmed had his ears pierced (as per their culture). Where/when I was growing up, you did that if you were a homo. Now, it's normal. It's all relative. 




 You can work work on your reading comprehension brother. We were talking about this verse in the context of Jesus telling his disciples to baptize all nations (gentiles). Here's how you used it:

"Jesus's commandment to "Go out and Baptize all nations in the name of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit." Was meant for all. Jesus commanded His disciples to treat the Gentiles, and the entire world."

This contradicts other statements which /u/g3t_re4l quoted you in which Jesus makes it abundently clear that he came solely for the Children of Israel and also conflicts with the Hebrew manuscript tradition for Matthew.

I mentioned the trinity and the baptism part off-hand so it's a shame you feel the need to focus on a tertiary issue rather than the relevant point. I also didn't say anything about the trinity in general, but as it pertains to **this particular verse**. In this verse, it's a widely recognized interpolation - a shallow reference to a non-canonical text doesn't dismiss that. 




  Jesus's commandment to "Go out and Baptize all nations in the name of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit."

Besides the fact that this ayah contradicts the other statements in Matthew that /u/g3t_re4l pointed out, it also suffered extensive interpolation. Within the standard Greek text, the trinity isn't even mentioned in the earliest sources. And in the Hebrew text, that entire statement of going to Gentiles doesn't exist. 




 Don't know what Hasan Sahih means, but I'm gonna take an educated guess and assume that it means better than good, but not quite authentic.

It depends on the scholars. This was used by our earlier scholars and they used it differently.

Not quite sure what Sahih in chain means. Don't know what Da'if in chain means

That means the muhaqiq only graded the sanad and has no comment on the matn. The matn could have gharib wording. 




 If there was a mob in the centre of Mecca complaining about some Islamic thing, it would be obvious that the mob is Muslim. If there's a mob in the centre of a Christian district, expressing anger in the immediate after-math of church bombings and lack of security - it's pretty obvious that the mob is Christian... 




  In Jeremiah 31, it says that a new covenant is coming were God will write his law on the hearts of his people. 

I know the context with which most modern Christians understand it. That said, when I read this - I see God saying his new covenant will be with a people who are very devout (His law is in their heart - meaning they keep the law very well, in contrast to those who broke it). By the context itself, Jeremiah is juxtaposing it with the assertion of how these two covenants are different in the preceding verse (one was broken by the people, the other one will be in their hearts/minds - meaning it won't be broken). That said, I'm not wholly convinced in the reliability of the Masoretic Yirmiyahu anyways given the extremely substantial differences in our earliest text (LXX).

In Hosea 2, it says God will go to the Gentiles, they will become his people, and they will accept him as God.

When God says he will go to the non-Israelites, does He mean he will go thru an Israelite (Jesus) and then an Israelite will go to the Gentiles, or that He will go to the Gentiles? In every verse I can think of where God says "I go to" or "I will go to" in Tanakh or the Nevi'im, God selects a prophet from amongst them (as the meaning of 'I will go to them'). Moreover, if in Hosea 2 God didn't mean he will send a Prophet among Gentiles, but would come through an Israelite, then the verse loses its substance as the chapter begins by first renouncing the status of Bani Yisrael as a Chosen People at the time when this event would take place.

When Christ fulfilled the old covenant that Israel broke, the new covenant came to the Gentiles. There was no longer a need to physically separate oneself from the other nations by the outward appearance. Instead, the separation is to be seen by the change in a persons heart and how they treat others.

Sure, that is your understanding of the verse. But if you've ever met an Ethiopian Christian, you'll notice they won't eat pork but they will eat other meat without keeping the Law of slaughter. Not every Christian sect interpreted Jesus as cancelling all the laws, just some of them. Pauline Christians (like yourself) differ in how you understand the cancellation, or the reason behind the laws.

All that being an aside however. The main point you were making (as I gather it) is that it makes sense for Jesus to abrogate some/all of the Law because your reading of Paul's interpretation of these passages is that the laws were prophesied to be cancelled? Ergo, **God saying** he will cancel some laws is justification for "how something can be fine on one day and then a sin on the next day". If that's the case though, Islamic theology surrounding the abrogation of laws is also wholly internally compatible. As Muslims believe God Himself said some laws/covenants will be adjusted later as well.

Divorce was and still is allowed, but this does not mean there was or is no sin in the matter. There are two parties involved in a marriage and if one of those parties breaks the vow through adultery, the other party is permitted to divorce without committing a sin. There is still a sin that was committed that lead to the divorce. 

As I said, *some Christians*. Your interpretation may allow divorce, many early Church fathers forbade it, many other Christians allow it without considering it a sin and others allowed it while considering it a sin. The Catholics will say it isn't allowed at all and play semantics to annul marriages, the Copts will say that it is only allowed in the case of adultery, etc. My point was though that *the law changed*. For the Jews, divorce was usually discouraged but never forbidden while Christians developed different laws around it based on the understanding of what Jesus meant.

I believe in an objective moral law for all people, so just because something was normal in a culture does not mean it was not a sin....What does the law was abrogated mean in this context?

For God to allow this thing - even order Abraham to do it - implies that it did not violate the law to which Abraham was subject - right? Regardless of Abraham's God being more merciful than the polytheistic gods - he did order it. Abraham also proved his faith in his willingness to carry it out. Abraham had no reason to believe God would save the child, and since *God* told him to do it, Abraham had no reason to believe it was immoral or a sin.

Let's leave aside that example - there's tons of examples that the Law wasn't temporally universal for the Jews. There are passages where God himself orders people to wipe out entire towns (down to every living thing) and there are other passages where God prohibits taking innocent lives. Either God is ordering people to commit a sin in one case (which is illogical since God would be the basis of a set of morals being 'objective') - or divine law/morals were subject to change over time/place/circumstance. Likewise the laws associated with Temple Judaism became defunct when the temple was demolished. King Solomon and other Prophets practiced polygamy and kept concubines vs the monogamy espoused by most Christians today, etc.

--

I agree that the laws didnt all come at once, but the Quran is supposed to be the next revelation confirming what was revealed before in the Torah and Gospel. Extra-marital sex as a sin was already revealed before the Quran. Divorce without adultery as a sin was already revealed before the Quran. 

Re: Confirming what came before, it means the stories (by confirming [and correcting them](http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Contrad/External/josephdetail.html)). The Qur'an isn't confirming the Biblical texts themselves as being true - as even extant texts/traditions don't (and didn't) agree with one another. The Qur'an also isn't confirming the old Laws, since it comes with a brand new Law/Covenant that abrogates any old laws. And the Qur'an isn't being revealed to just Jews and Christians, but to all people. Not every group in or around Arabia had the same law. This is a time when people were following one of many Pagan traditions, Mandeanism, Manicheanism, Zoroastrianism, different forms of Christianity, of Judaism, etc. People also had different laws, as the Prophets that God would've sent in India or China didn't come down with all the same stuff as the Prophets God sent to the Israelites (besides Monotheistic theology) - as per Islam, and other people designed laws without any prophetic guidance at all, etc.

The Hadiths seem to indicate that the men recognized they could not just go off and have sex with the local women, since they made the observation that their women/wives were not with them. This tells me they knew adultery was a sin and created a new form of marriage to get around it. Whats the difference between this a prostitution? Im sure you have heard the saying, A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

Well, they didn't create mut'a, it existed in Arabia before Islam, and it existed among Jews even before that (as the Sages did it - I would imagine they certainly didn't consider it contravening the Laws of marriage or falling under prostitution). The main thing about prostitution that makes it prostitution isn't the term limit imo. 




 The idea of monotheism is rather new

That isn't really a provable statement. Anthropologists are led to that assumption by the fact that there are early examples of possible idols, and the hypothesis is that monotheism arose from attempts to consolidate a myriad of Gods. The issue with the hypothesis however is that in Monotheistic, and Pantheistic, traditions, the top-God (or only God) isn't generally represented with idols. So anthropologists have really nothing to work with here as original monotheism vs original polytheism isn't exactly provable through artifacts. Looking just at the archeaological record though completely ignores the strange coincidence that the many polytheistic cultures seem to often have an overarching top-God. 




  I dont understand how something can be fine on one day and then a sin on the next day.

Before Christ (AS), eating unblessed meat was prohibited, after Christ it became allowed according to some Christians. Before Christ (AS), divorce was permitted while after him it became disallowed by some Christians. In the time of Adam (AS), incest was logically not prohibited - after Adam at some point, incest is prohibited. Before God commanded Abraham to kill his son, killing wasn't exactly something good. The law was abrogated and Abraham's act was not a sin by divine revelation (regardless that he didn't get to complete it). etc. Within Moses' on time - its really not plausible that the entirety of the tanakh *and* the entirety of the oral law came all at once either.

You can see laws revealed in time even then till Abraham. So you have effectively the same thing if you believe in the Old Testament, the Oral laws, or the different traditions of . The laws stipulated in different books didn't come all at once - as revelation progressed, laws were adapted besides the core and besides the essence of the theology (One God - existing outside of matter). If you believe, as Muslims, that God didn't only send prophets to Bani Israel, then there were laws in other parts of the world as well - and remnants of those likely exist in other religious/cultural traditions.

And even with the laws - there are differences of opinion since the beginning and different understandings between the early Jewish Sages till today. The concept of difference of opinion is more enshrined in Islam since the Prophet allowed people who were with him to have a varied understanding in a number of traditions, as well as Qur'anic reference to past Prophets.

So - in much the same way, Islam as it pertains to law wasn't revealed all at once. It's not easy for people to do a complete 100% about-face in their life. There was no Shari' law when the revelation first came down - and then ~500 legal verses came over time. People were directed to things according to the Prophetic methodology by order of importance (which still ultimately exists when Islam spreads today):

When the Prophet () sent Mu`adh to Yemen, he said to him, "You are going to a nation from the people of the Scripture, so let the first thing to which you will invite them, be the Tauhid of Allah. If they learn that, tell them that Allah has enjoined on them, five prayers to be offered in one day and one night. And if they pray, tell them that Allah has enjoined on them Zakat of their properties and it is to be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor. And if they agree to that, then take from them Zakat but avoid the best property of the people."

Ultimately though, laws and sins aren't the essence of the religion. The fundamental premise (tawhid - Oneness of God) is what matters more than anything. 




 If you check the narration you cited, you'll see this part:

'Abdullah then recited this verse: 'Those who believe do not make unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Allah does not like trangressers" (al-Qur'an, v. 87)

This is commentary of the Sahabi and not part of the matn of the actual prophetic saying. In a lot of ahadith, a companion might add elucidation as to his understanding, but the correct understanding is not necessarily what one particular companion, or one particular scholar understood regarding a verse. If you want a detailed explanation of an ayah, you'll need to check tafasir where the various opinions are mentioned as well as the opinion of the jama' (majority) or where a companion will change their understanding based on evidence.

Some companions, for instance, did not know that alcohol was prohibited. So they were drinking in Syria - but when the information arrived, they changed their opinion on it. 




 |What happened was **absolutely terrible**. That said, if r/Islam needs to condemn shit every times some dumb ass Muslim commits a crime, we won't have time to do much else.

|Though what happened at the churches was abhorrent, the two innocent (until proven guilty) Muslims lynched by the angry Christian mobs and then burnt also deserve our condolences and these mobs our condemnation in the same vein. Right after the apparent suicide bombings, these guys caught in the wrong place at the wrong time immediately had the mob's "justice" unleashed on them and the mob re-snatched from the police who tried to rescue them.

|The group that claimed responsibility for this event is Jamaat ul Ahrar. Jamaat ul Ahrar, not Taliban in Afghanistan, not Tehreek-e-Taliban in Pakistan. Jamaat ul Ahrar was a completely new organization led by Abdul Wali. Abdul Wali (or Omar Khorasani) was accused by Tehreek e Taliban and other such groups as being a proper wacko - and doing things they didn't accept (and since then, TTP has been catching the blame for his shenanigans regardless because of the nature of politics/media).

This includes the recent attack on the Pakistani school where several youth were murdered in cold blood - which happened conveniently *right after* TTP and Pak Govt finally got into peace talks. Those peace talks were some of the biggest breakthroughs in redressing the concerns of the tribes without bombing them into the ground, and creating more angry Pakistanis killing Pakistanis, that we've had in a long time. All ruined by a disavowed off-shoot group that conveniently shoots up a school and reignites the war.

It also includes violence he oversaw when he lead Ahrar ul Hind while breaking cease-fires. Same exact shit. Everybody is finally talking peace, and he conveniently goes back and prevents peace from ever being attainable.

And now - his group (Jamaat ul Ahrar) allegedly claimed responsibility for this horrific event *right after* conveniently rejoining TTP a few days ago! TTP and others likely didn't even know about it, and this small outfit will once again ignite the continued strife in that region as opposed the reconciliation talks that the vast majority of people on all sides want.

What's going on over there right now is a lot more complicated, and a lot less black and white then people think. So without minimizing the suffering of the dead, and the loss of their loved ones, just wanted to get some facts out there. 




 From what I got, the mob was Christian mob was pounding on two men, *then* the police tried to rescue them, *and then* the mob retook and eventually murdered the men, lynching them and burning them. 




 Unreliable source...

The guy may be nuts, but he won't be saying shit like this. This sort of shit would push away his base. 




 This was not TTP, it's the new supposed spin-off JA... 




 It's important that the government deals with this appropriately, and through legal channels. We can't be having any of this sort of shit:

The crowd also attacked two men it accused of involvement in the explosions, killing both of them. 

The mob lynchings and violence that will follow this will only exacerbate the situation. :( 




 Before getting your jimmies in a bunch, check the source. This is an important issue for public debate but let's get some real journalism here.
