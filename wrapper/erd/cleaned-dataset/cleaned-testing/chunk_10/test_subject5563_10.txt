 That must be it, everytime i have always wanted to download any dlc for driveclub after I have opened the app, it doesn't work.  




 Well thankfully in the opening credits of any Bond film we never see the singer actually performing.  




 Personally I actually really loved [Skyfall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4gdhsVKTcs) but there are tons of classics, Casino Royale also had a great opening which felt very much in line with the theme of the film. The Brosnan era had some great ones as well apart from Die Another Day. Which ones do you guys rate?  




 I think the 10 may have been built for the film, since they go through a few cars while filming.  




 So on more than a few occasions my PSN store will never load, nor will any of the content under any of the games I own. The only way to fix this is to restart/standby my PS4 and go instantly into the store as soon as I log into my account. Anyway to fix this permanently as it's really annoying.  




 Konami?? iD software made rage and Bethesda published it. 




 So that's what happened with his title he was working on. Pretty crazy to see that Ubisoft essentially bought it and told him to gtfo.  




 So far the best new shows of the year for me are Mr Robot, Better Call Saul and Daredevil.  




 Thanks!! 




 Hey guys, does anyone know the song that's playing in the background of the scene where Frank is at the bar in the nightclub and notices his wife walking into the backroom?  




 Probably pre-paid cards which can be used online. There are other ways of paying for services without using your CC.  




 I remember hearing a fox exec turning down a james cameron/ridley scott alien project for avp.  




 "They don't get enough love".

lol  




 Dont regret buying the console at all but the only game I regret buying is Destiny. Me and my friend played it for maybe 10 hours and gave up. 




 If you have the season pass then no, if not then yes. I recommend getting the season pass though, such awesome value for content.  




 Imagine if Driveclub slowly evolves into Motorstorm 0_o, but seriously imagine Motorstorm with driveclub's weather system.  




 It is 




  Chris Columbus
 
Really? While Chris is a competent director I feel that he would lack the vision a Bond film needs.
 




 I know a lot of people hated the film but I loved it. [This scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMuAqBo2K6Q) in Chappie where he gets bullied kind of made my eyes water a bit.  




 Yeah it's a strange one, I guess that it's a lot harder to port the HD collection over since it would look extremely dated on the PS4 more so than the PS3 and would essentially require you to remake the game. Also GoW 1 and 2 are on PS Now right?  




 Yeah that door shut did look amazing, then ubisoft did the classic downgrade and people aren't as impressed anymore haha 




 Trailer in November.  




 Thought you guys may enjoy this read, their way of development reminds me very much of Naughty Dog, it also goes into the challenges faced for PS4 development.  









 How is everyone liking the new Chem Bros album? 




 Tomorrowland bombed and Disney got scared to they canned it:( 




 Eh I dunno if I agree with Divergent being on there since it had every dystopia cliche imaginable and didn't use them well either.  




 Song is [Icarus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n07RJW2BEBc) by Michael McCann from Deus Ex: Human Revolution.  




 Good news, also means that they seem to be fairly confident in their remaster.  









 Haha yeah, it was all memory going up that straight. 




 Man I would love for Michael Mann to direct season 3. It would be right up his alley and you know that the gunplay is going to be on point.  




 She's a clone.  









 The pilot was great, definitely keen on the series. 




 I thought so at least. They only did the freeze frame in one episode in Season 1 correct? Perhaps that's there way of signifying a big cliff hanger ending.  




 Now we know why they didn't show much of it in the first trailer.  




 Me too bud, we can be mediocre together! 




 Looks fun put me down as Mclaren please! 




 Yeesh looks like a launch PS3/360 game.  




 I feel that Gattaca might be very relevant in the next few years.  




 This is more of a Fox thing, not a Marvel deal.  




 I wish this track was on the standard release, i'll never understand why they release different tracks in different regions/mediums.  




 Probably the most effective footwear to have on in combat.  




 I seem to have misled everyone here by using the actual title of the video, I apologise for those I have hurt during this process. 




 For you. 




 Does anyone know what language Tyrell and the pregnant woman (his wife I assume) are speaking? 




 Yeah that house looked fucking dope. I love the big metal warehouse like door.  




 Agree, every other sub for tv shows do it.  









 Dirty Mike and the boys at it again, classic.  




 This game really deserves a sequel, I heard it sold pretty well so hopefully it happens. The game really picks up on the airship imo. Also the voice acting was fucking phenomenal.  




 The music and visuals during the [World Engine Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSjI7gwuKtg) were also amazing as well.  




 While I do love the Marvel films a lot, the soundtracks are definitely the weakest aspects of their films. While MoS wasn't an amazing film, the soundtrack definitely helped carry the film in my opinion.  




 [here you go m8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovqM72em1dA) 




 I would say Drake looked a bit too perfect in the previous uncharted games, he looks more realistic in UC4 and less plasticky looking. 




 How was it? Sorry if it's an extremely broad question.  




 Even though they won't bring back the character of Kyle, they can certainly introduce his characteristics into a new character.  




 I enjoyed the film for what it was and hated it for what it could have been :( 




 I thought the pacing in the film was so off, just in terms of how they get from point A-B on the short timespan they have.  




 why are so many drivers exceeding the track limit on that particular turn?
 




 gg mclaren 




 This track has been growing on me after a few listens, it's different to their usual stuff since Alice is gone but different doesn't mean bad.  




   Also, it has one of the worst UI's i've ever seen.

Really? I think it's one of the most intuitive UI's I have seen in a racing game. Easy to navigate and it remembers your previous selections so you don't have to mess around selecting what you wanted again. Also the addition of pressing the HOME button to go back to the base menu is a function every game should have. 
 




 It's a lot, I bought the full game at launch, and shortly got the season pass (which is amazing value). The full game adds a lot more cars, especially since they have released quite a few cars for free as well and then full game also has 5 more locations (Norway, Japan, Scotland, Canada and Chile). IMO it's worth getting it since I hear its pretty cheap now as well.  









 To be fair Google Music at least lets you upload 10k songs to your account to listen whenever and wherever you want. 




 Definitely a cyberpunk blade runner style rooftop, smoking a cigarette haha 




 One the 50/50 subreddit, this [gif](http://gfycat.com/AcademicRapidFanworms) of an ISIS member getting beaten up came up, is there a video for it?  




 Marketing. I didn't really see any adverts anywhere for that movie.  




 How does one even determine what is the "best" of all time, isn't it all subjective? 




 Not allowed to drink at your own 21st because of your judgemental grandmother? What a negative Nancy.  




 I really hope RAD get the chance to make a sequel, the game was really getting good towards the end!
 




 The framerate is a locked 30FPS without a single drop and the controls are super tight, perhaps that's why you don't notice the lack of 60fps 




 Possible to get a quick run down on how to install this? 




 I'm afraid I can't do that.  




 Aren't there less than 10 of these in the world? Why would one of them be used a cop car? 




 I have the DVD of these films, they are all awesome. Each director has a really cool and unique spin on the series. One of my faves is [Ambush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsWXkuyIdoY) directed by John Frankenheimer and  [Hostage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSCPRNeVuLk) directed by John Woo.  




 You haven't even played the game... 




 I tuned the fuck out when the woman came on stage to talk about mobile games and when this minion fuckery was on stage, one thing to remember though their conference is just as much for fans as it is their shareholders.  




 It's a fully armed and operational racing game.  




 Yeah vivid is awesome from a distance haha, not worth the crowds to go see it up close in my opinion. 














 Piers, haha classic.  




 The Bond box set on blu ray is one of the best purchases I have made in a while.  




 I agree, he felt way too old for the role, when I was younger I thought he was entertaining but as I got older it felt like he was just physically out of his depth.  




 Can you blame them though... 




 Man it's being really tough being a McLaren fan these days, hopefully the trouble will be worth it this year.   
 




 Love it, very Studio Ghibli like! 




 I use it all the time since I commute on a highway most days. It's really easy to set up on my car, since it's all face buttons on the steering wheel, also it automatically brakes/accelerates when driving up or down hills.  




 I think God of War 2 and MGS 3 were all pretty amazing as well, you can tell they were squeezing the PS2 to the limit.  




 Yeah I agree, they should have just included it in the initial blu ray release instead of trying to get people to double dip.  




  is like when I find out StarFox was called StarWing in Europe

Huh it was called Lylat Wars here in Australia, thought Europe shared the same name.  




 This glitch man haha, i'm actually impressed that the characters lips sync everytime he says SHAUN, I thought it would have only been a voice over.  




 Not a video, they had a backup console. Here's a [tweet](https://twitter.com/bruce_straley/status/610644415409815552) from Bruce Straley (guy playing the demo). 




 Hmm some MKV's work perfectly fine while others just don't play for whatever reason. Some will play but won't let me skip through the video. A step in the right direction for DLNA but it seems that it needs to have some work done first.  




 Pretty sure cinevia is only on Sony titled movies right? 




 No doubt, I would love to see them as well! 




 And then be replaced by "Lancers, WRX's, Skylines, Supras, RX7's".  




 Not to mention that Sony were selling them at a massive loss as well for the first few years of the PS3.  




 It will but they will all be unsuccessful because they are not the Jurassic franchise.  




 You can press up on the d-pad to cycle to the specific camera set which includes the side views, front views and this view. You can cycle between these using R1 and they stay on that angle without switching.  




 Yep its replay 




 MclarenF1 LM GTR 




 Hey guys so I tried something different and recorded this entirely from the alternate cockpit angle to give a different sense of speed, also if anyone is keen on the track/weather settings they are as follows:

Munnar (Forward)
Time: 18:30x15 or 30
Weather: Dynamic 









 I would say try and give it a shot because it gets a lot better around episode 4. 




 I really loved it, it has some flaws but to be honest it seems to me that the Wachowski's go all in on a project, and they are the most ambitious bunch in film/tv (in my opinion). I'd rather see ambitious albeit flawed attempts rather than safe but good attempts.  




 Did they ever officially release this track, I want it badly! 









 **Sense8** So the reviews for this show have been fairly divisive but I am currently on episode 11 and the show has been getting really good in my opinion, the first few episodes are very exposition heavy as they are setting up a rather complex scenario but once that is all out of the way it really gets flowing. Really strange that the show went from 8+ on imdb down to around low 7s and then went back up to 8+, I am guessing that people felt the show picked up and got better as well?  




 They all look like characters from Oblivion.  




 How long is this supposed to be set after JP1, because surely someone would have gotten the canister in that space of time instead of waiting long enough that the UN had to ban cloning.  




 I would say its a bit of both, more so 3 but not in a bad way.  




 I have a feeling that the actual base game will be completely free for PS+ minus any DLC. 




 how can you live with yourself? 




 Crazy that Adam "#dealwithit" Orth is behind this game, glad to see he turned a rather negative experience into a possible positive one.  




 Actually this is what I should have referenced, Daredevil is still part of the MCU but is much much darker than the films.  




 So do you guys/gals think that we'll ever see a mature rated Star Wars television series? It doesn't have to be mature in terms of violence but perhaps with much more heavier/serious adult themes instead that aren't really tackled in the films all that much. I remember hearing about the cancelled Star Wars Underworld series which was in development before Disney bought Lucasfilm which revolved around the Coruscant underworld, sounded amazing in my opinion. Imagine if HBO were allowed to develop a Star Wars series *drools*.  




 Kinda funny that in the John Carter film people were reminded of Geonosis in the arena scene, when techincally it should be the other way around.
