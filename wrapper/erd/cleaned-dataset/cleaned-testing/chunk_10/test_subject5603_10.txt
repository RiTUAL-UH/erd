 Witte said one problem for the workers is that employers could take advantage of the provision and subtly coerce workers to "volunteer."

You forgot the beginning of the quote. 




 Why do employers need the ability to make people work seven days a week?  Is it really to their advantage? 




 Reason magazine seems to do smugness pretty well itself. 




 Apparently the man has a rich sense of irony. 




 "I thought it was important to put the focus on the job creators," Walker said.

Jesus, are people still falling for this bunco routine? 




 Apparently, Cruz thinks this is something to be proud of. 









 Scott Walker 2016 --  Because you don't want any rights or protections at work 




 Finally, the scourge of ethics has been eliminated from Wisconsin government.  
Edit: Missing word 




 If that's true, it sure [sucks](http://blackdemographics.com/population/) at it. 




 It's the real weenies who feel the need to talk tough. 




 Perhaps because there was a lot of news involving the Confederate flag? 




 I don't get it either. Dick Cheney is at least as repulsive as Donald Trump. 




 The more Scott Walker campaigns, the more he proves he is not intellectually fit for the office hes seeking. He asserts innocent ignorance on matters he should by now know something about  a way of masking his apparent bigotry. 

I don't care much for Richard Cohen, but he's got Walker figured out pretty well. 




 Puts him [tied with Dick Cheney](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/01/politics/campaign/01CHEN.html).  




 But Marco Rubio is ready.  But don't take my word for it. Just ask Marco Rubio. 




 Why not. Fox pretty well runs the Republican Party anyway. 




 Off is the default position of Trump's filter.  Assuming he has a filter at all. 




 OK, how about the world's greatest living troll? 




 It was over 10 years ago. Maybe he thinks hypocrisy has a statue of limitations. 




 The fact is, were a nation of laws, Walker said. 

When will Walker or any other pandering nativist talk about the importance of enforcing the law against employing undocumented workers?    




 Good, cause I'm enjoying the ride. 




 I support a free enterprise system unshackled from bad regulation and big labor unions  which were the right thing for American workers in 1890.

And in 2020.  Maybe Jay will come around on that next. 




 We should let citizens carry guns when they go to meet Presidential candidates.  Why do the second amendment advocates put up with this intolerable restriction? 




 Judging from how many conservative Christians act, you'd think Jesus told us to berate and denigrate the poor and suck the asses of the wealthy.   




 Absolutely, when one these 'secure the border' clowns addresses the issue of employers of illegal immigration, I'll start listening to them. 




 Or we could give equally derisive names to other candidates, like Scottie "Dog" Walker. 




 No, but I promise you can look forward to convoluted arguments about why this liberal Pope's pronouncements don't matter and the pope should stay out of politics . 




 The Congressional Research Service found that the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants do not fit in the category that fits Trumps description: aggravated felons, whose crimes include murder, drug trafficking or illegal trafficking of firearms.

I don't disagree with the idea that we'd be better off with less illegal immigration. But it sure seems to me he's exaggerating the criminality of illegal immigrants in some rather heated language. And he's ignoring another group of criminals. The most frequent crime involving illegal aliens is employing them.  Somehow I rarely hear these secure borders advocates talk about cracking down on illegally hiring immigrants. Seems to me fewer employment opportunities for illegal immigrants would do a lot more to reduce their numbers than any wall on the border. 




 How about [this stuff](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/)? 




 So if you want to spew hysterical anti-immigrant racism, looks like you don't need to worry about Scott Walker criticizing you.  









 I wonder why the author omitted [this statistic](http://www.jsonline.com/business/wisconsin-ranks-35th-in-us-for-job-creation-over-walkers-first-term-b99520739z1-307884841.html). 




 My salary or Donald's?  
 




 The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Go for it, Donald. 




 Esa es una buena broma, Esteban.
 




 Move over Chicago.  Wisconsin is going to show you how real political corruption works. 









  Trump isn't running for President, he's putting on the most widely viewed absurdist art performance ever.  




 Fact checking Donald Trump seems like a pointless undertaking.  




 And for those trying to play gotcha by pointing out that some of what she said differed from ideas that prevailed when her husband was president, well, many liberals have changed their views in response to new evidence. Its an interesting experience; conservatives should try it some time.

They do learn. Unfortunately, what they've learned is that bashing immigrants and less successful citizens and toadying up to the wealthy is a viable election strategy.  









 Trump-ism not conservatism but a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense.

But a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense is working pretty well for Scott Walker! 









 Doesn't mean we can't enjoy it while it lasts. 




 Of course , Walker loves Kohl's.  A business that blackmailed Wisconsin into tax subsidies and pay its cashiers less than $9 an hour is the perfect example for his economic vision. 




 It's hard to believe, but not too long ago Wisconsin had a reputation for squeaky clean government.  Walker and Fitzgerald have got that turned all the way around. 




 A greasy half-truth from Scott Walker? Get ready for many more, America. 




 The base eats it up? Check. 




 The title is the best one sentence description of our current election I've read. 




 Because unfortunately, laws are always selectively or irregularly enforced. (We could go a long time without an income rate increase if we hired enough IRS agents to truly investigate our richest Americans.) In immigration, there are too many people who have a stake in keeping things as is, so the law enforcement is underfunded and desultory.  




 The ones against entering the country or the ones against hiring people who entered the country illegally? 




 The guy who just called Hillary Clinton [Desperate, Sad]( http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/14/donald-trump-responds-to-desperate-sad-hillary-clinton/) is a Democratic plant?  Carlos, would you explain how that fits into your conspiracy theory?  




 Why are these GOP weenies always so eager to go to war? 




 Are they furious enough to punish the employers who hire illegal immigrants?  Not likely. 




 I think Rick Santorum's only priority at the moment is getting someone to pay attention to him. 




 Something that would help the people who earn the least is 'a really lame idea'.  Looks like you picked the right party Scott. 




 He's just sort of making up employment numbers, I'd say. 









 Except Wisconsin didn't have a 3.5 billion dollar deficit.  At least not if you're [using the calculation Walker favors, now that he's governor](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/13/scott-walker/did-scott-walker-flip-flip-budget-shortfall/).  




 No 6. He lies about as readily as he breathes

 So, the Koch Brothers are putting $900 million into the election and Jeb Bush has raised $114 million, but somehow jobs supporting Republican candidates pay $1000 a month.  But they're going to make things better for America's workers.   




 Start with Scott Walker. Please. 




 OK, then I'm sorry for the citizens in Maine who didn't vote for this clown and need to live through his administration.  Us Wisconsin progressives understand all too well. 




 If that's true, then [this guy](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/us/billionaire-lifts-marco-rubio-politically-and-personally.html) is going to want his money back. 




 Fun while it lasts ... but remember Herman Cain was leading the polls for a while last time. 




 I feel sorry for the citizens of Maine ... but I hope they can take some solace in the entertainment their governor provides the rest of us. 




 It's taken awhile, but they're starting to [wise up](https://law.marquette.edu/poll/).   




 I hope Walker runs on his 'accomplishments' in Wisconsin.  Scott Walker - Ending Wisconsin's tradition of fine public education !! 




 Where he will be joined by [zero](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/07/07/republicans-2016-hopefuls-to-skip-la-raza-gathering-of-latino-activists/) Republican presidential candidates.  




 Once all the good teachers are gone, we'll hear about how Kansas schools are failing and they need to privatized.  




 I guess we'll have to agree to disagree about how badly our elections have been compromised by money. 




 He scares me a little, and I can't help but to notice that the more his opposition hates on him, the more support he gets, due to this deeply seated democratic hatred for his haters, and what they stand for

[Maybe not](https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2015/04/16/marquette-law-school-poll-finds-walker-job-approval-down/). Although he may coast into the White House under of a barrage of right wing money.  God help us all then. 




 There are two issues with Walker's election victories. First, there's the [two electorate issue](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-09/why-rubio-jeb-walker-and-kasich-are-not-as-purple-as-they-look).  Conservatives do better in off year elections.  Second, money obviously plays a big role in elections (why else would politicians spend so much time chasing it), and Walker has received millions of dollars of out of state support.  He was elected as much by ALEC et, al as the voters of Wisconsin. 




 That's less than $2 for [every US casualty](http://costsofwar.org/article/us-and-allied-wounded) in Iraq and Afghanistan. A bargain! 




 The 11th-hour additions include a repeal of wage protections for construction workers on local government projects, the elimination of workers right to one day off per week, ... Another change made over the Fourth of July weekend eliminates the states long-standing living wage law and replaces all references to a living wage with minimum wage.

Scott Walker for President! Bringing you fewer rights or protections on the job! 




 What I can't understand is why anybody would want to subject an audience to speech by George W. Bush, let alone give him a $100,000 for it. 




 On the upside, as long as Brownback is preoccupied with this nonsense, he's not  fucking up Kansas's economy even further. 




 That will work out to about 2.50 per citizen in Oregon. I'll bet they can handle it. 




 We'll see more of this and eventually it will become the norm.  The US requires a more educated workforce and high school isn't enough. With unions being eviscerated, we're losing the apprentice program, so community colleges will need to provide the skill training. 




 He is the only bluesman to have his music [launched into deep space](http://www.vox.com/2015/7/7/8906867/scott-walker-immigration).  




 I wonder if he'll feel the need to [retract](http://www.vox.com/2015/7/7/8906867/scott-walker-immigration) that statement soon.  




 And that invalidates all the other evidence and arguments for the existence of climate change?  How?
 




 I don't care to defend anyone's bad behavior. But how does this incident refute all the evidence that climate change is occurring?  




 Are you talking about [this incident](http://www.factcheck.org/2009/12/climategate/)?  




 Or perhaps it's only common knowledge inside your echo chamber. 




 Source? 




 And Walker, Rubio, Bush, etc.  They're not conservatives, they're merely dogsbodies for the wealthy.  




 I'm looking forward to AEI's article on how outrageous executive compensation affects prices. 




 Might work. I'd like to ask them if they want to dispute the current scientific consensus in astronomy or germ theory.  




 Not to forget [this conversation](http://host.madison.com/news/local/writers/steven_elbow/british-prime-minister-david-cameron-i-never-told-scott-walker/article_65cb00ae-94fc-5850-b6d3-aa6fa374bf71.html) with Scott Walker either.  Odd how this keeps happening to Walker, isn't it? 




 The GOP's usual M.O.. 




 On Sunday, after three days of pressure from Mr. Walkers aides, Mr. Moore said that he had misspoken when recounting his call with Mr. Walker  and that the call had never actually taken place.

He had misspoken and the call never took place anyway?  Of course it's not like Stephen Moore had any integrity to lose. 




  A review of documents of the ruling obtained by International Business Times showed that the study saying the $7.25 minimum wage was adequate in meeting living wage standards was largely **based on findings provided by the restaurant industry in the state**.

Scott Walker for President -  Prosperity through Lower Wages
 









 Source? 




 Right, so let's elect someone named Clinton.  Seems the economy works better than we elect someone named Bush. 




 Hey Alex and Matthew, while your at it, why don't you tell your old man his economics are bullshit?  Or call him out on his corruption or lies?   




 I'd prefer to think of him as a bought and paid for toady. 




 Walker is running as corrupt a political machine as you'll find in America.  
Edit: Couple of links for sourcing. 
[The Progressive](http://www.progressive.org/news/2014/10/187897/scott-walker%E2%80%99s-corruption-problem) and

 No where in the article is there a quote from the CBO saying the economy is in a death spiral.  However there is a quote from the House Budget Committee chairman saying our national debt is spiraling out of control.  That kind of reporting would get you a C- in your Intro to Journalism class.  Oh, and no link to the report, just links to other Washington Times articles.  Guess they don't want to make it easy for anyone to fact check. 




 Cruz already has gathered support from other ultra-rich backers, including the billionaire hedge fund manager Robert Mercer. Mercer and two others seeded a pack of spending groups called Keep the Promise, allowing Cruz to reveal a $31 million haul in a single week.

Man of the people, that Ted Cruz.  




 Because Minnesota and Wisconsin are relatively similar states that  had elections in 2010 and followed very different paths, with very different results.  It's about as close to a controlled experiment as you can have in American economics. 




 Only when you compare it to a Republican run Wisconsin 




 Which side has a track record of trying to do something (not very much, but something) for the middle class?  Which side would you trust do address income and wealth inequality? Which side realizes that humans are contributing to climate change? If you say the Republicans, (or these issues aren't important to you) go ahead and vote for them.  Assuming we don't get Sanders, I'll take my chances with Clinton. 




 Everybody gets a turn leading the Republican primary polls. Herman Cain was leading some polls at one point last time. 




 I always remember this John Kenneth Galbraith quote when making political decisions. 

Politics is the art of choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable.

Am I thrilled by the backers of and all the choices made by the  Clintons and Obama? Of course not. Would I take take them again over another Bush or Scott Walker, etc?  Absolutely.
 




 Everything really. Wisconsin used to be known for clean government and great public education.  Scott Walker has turned that around. 




 I don't want to trade. Do you? 




 More than a third of the firms $33 million in proceeds from 2007 to 2013 came from banking giants Lehman Bros. and Barclays, which paid Bush a combined total of about $12 million for his work as a senior adviser.

Who's interests do you think he's going to look after if he's elected President?  Yours? 




 I have two issuesv with your argument.  'Many Republicans like Rand Paul' doesn't consist of very many Republicans.  Only a [dismaying small percentage](http://www.businessinsider.com/10-percent-of-republicans-think-climate-change-is-human-caused-2015-7) of Republicans believe that climate change is caused by humans. Secondly, 'strong capitalism' isn't going to fix climate change by itself.  If you want a market based solution to climate change, you need to provide some incentives, some way to profit from addressing the problem.  There was support for that among republicans in the past (solutions like cap and trade), but it's virtually non-existent now. 




 In 1998, Walker championed the Truth In Sentencing Act, a bill that would go on to become law, star in that constituent newsletter and create an approach to imprisonment critics said would later balloon the states prison population and lead to severe racial disparities in the prison population.  .... A 2004 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel investigation found the law would cost Wisconsin $1.8 billion dollars over 25 years and bring prison spending to par with the states university system.

See what Scott Walker has done for Wisconsin - think what he can do for America. 









 If I were comparing them I would have written a statement like 'Although Obama drew 30,000 for a speech at the height of the election, Sanders was able to draw a crowd 1/3 that size for a speech 16 months before the election.'  I was pointing out that Madison speeches draw huge crowds. If Clinton comes here, I wouldn't be surprised if she has a larger crowd than the 5500 she drew in New York 




 I thought your 'two ways to look at it' hardly covered all the scenarios of people working many hours.  Notice I amended it with an 'Or' statement.  




 Or they have meaningless low pay jobs and need to work 2 or 3 jobs to survive.  Or they have "supervisory" or non-exempt jobs and are forced to work extra hours because their employer would rather squeeze them than hire extra employees. You have a rather optimistic view of how employment works for Americans on the lower end of the pay scale. 




 Hey Scott, since you're suddenly concerned about environmental issues, you might want to take a second look at climate change. 




 This early polls are as much about name recognition as support.  




 Sure is, I almost bought one myself. We seem to go through car trends in my neighborhood.  First we all had Saturns, then suddenly there were Priuses everywhere, and now it's the Fit.  




 They're not meant to be comparable, just to demonstrate that if you're a Democrat Presidential candidate, Madison is good place to get a large crowd for a speech.
