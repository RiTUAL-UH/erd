 Tomato, tomato. 














 That's how I saw it too. 




 It looked like a blue heeler (cattle dog) in the original video. 




 There may be a Scully in there somewhere. 














 A very small, compact Diahatsu-Weyland-Yutani hatchback APC.  









 I've been doing something similar. I think the Glass Skull is so effective, except you will get a lot of moisture build up. You'll probably need to leave the cap off.
 









 Along with The Smith Street Band, I think Courtney Barnett is one of the best songwriters Australia has seen in a long while. 




 Dang it. Reddit can never have too many safe's.
 




 It's safe to safe that he achieved that!
 




 I guess he didn't want to be the butt of any dick jokes. 









 Didn't stop me from looking up though. 









 Technically, this joke isn't funny. 




 We don't say which comedians we do like. We'll say which comedians we don't like. When asked, of course. 




 Now you...do? 









 Honestly, similar to my [Glass Skull](http://i.imgur.com/nrWSQvi.jpg) project, I hadn't put much thought into the plants themselves. These are my first two terrariums and I'm just seeing how the containers handle themselves (how much water to use, what soil/rock combination to use). I'm almost ashamed to say that these are carnation seeds, but I'll probably change it to something more suitable  once these guys run their course. Its a simple set up with larger stones blocking the gumball shoot, bonsai pebbles at the base and plain potting mix for the seeds. It's all trial and error. 




 The top screws off, and any excess water drips down into the gumball catcher. I suspect the plants will outgrow the container, but I'm okay with that. 




 I had the exact same thought, the human eyes on an animals face. 









 Taken on the camera of my LG G2. I only managed to get a couple of shots because those boats were flying. 




 The boats all ended up in the drain at the end of the street. We couldn't  keep up with them to see Pennywise though.
 









 Almost, it was taken from the Katherine Times,  by the NT News. 




 Dang it. I was hoping alcohol was involved. 




 I dare say alcohol was involved. So, how'd you burn your arm? 









 Yes. Yes it is. 




 It looks like it's climbed it's way out of something else. 









 Am playing Super Nintendo's (1993) Tecmo Superbowl right now. So good.
 









 Grouse. 









 [Why so serious?]( http://i.imgur.com/dg7T2mF.jpg) 




 A meat pie and sauce. Typical footy watching fare down under. 




 Vegemite solves everything.  




 I thought about that too. I'm not superstitious, but I'm willing to try anything to watch these guys rise. Looks like I've got to buy some more meat pies. 




 Yeeew!! 




 Thanks to everyone helping out with the streams, I feel I'm about to watch us break the losing streak. JUST WIN, BABY! 




 That was the first thing I checked. NBC Sunrise or some bullshit? No thanks. But check out those streams people are posting, awesome!
 




 This one works! Admittedly though, my AdBlock wasn't enabled before. Thanks, mate!
 




 One stream, please!
 




 Giving vipbox a go.

Edit: RIP PC. 




 I'm checking out Firstrowsports.se, I'm not going to lie, it's damn confusing.
 









 Then [this guy]( http://i.imgur.com/UGw1mKB.gif) was totally impressed. 




 Reminds me of Sas Christian's [work](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=sas+christian safe=off espv=2 biw=1440 bih=799 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=Ry1CVLWjNOKzmAWA5ILQBw ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ).
 




 That ventolin inhale.

 I'm definitely aiming for a self sustainable terrarium, I dare say there will be plenty of trials and plenty of errors. 




 I didn't put much thought into it, but I chose [these](http://i.imgur.com/Syg3UR5.jpg) because they don't have a lot of height and they will grow in most seasons. My next attempt will be with venus flytraps, because they seem to require a lot of moisture.  




 No, it's just a $10 knock off. It is the same size though. 




 Thanks. I normally leave it open each night, maybe I should leave it off during the day as well.
