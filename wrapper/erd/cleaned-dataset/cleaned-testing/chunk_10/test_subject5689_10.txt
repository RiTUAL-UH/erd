 [Here](https://goo.gl/maps/apAKw) is a link to the location I took the picture on google maps. It's right at the apex of the big u-turn. There's a pull-off on the side of the road where you can get out and look at the canyon. 

If you have time, you should definitely check out Gateway while you're there. There's an awesome place to stay there called [Gateway Canyons Resort](http://www.gatewaycanyons.com) that has TONS of cool stuff. My personal favorite is the auto museum, which isn't that expensive, and you get to go see some really unique cars. The whole place is owned by the guy who owns the Discovery channel, and he's put a lot of work into it and it shows. Anyways, take care and let me know if you have any more questions! 




 It's called the Hanging Flume and was built by gold miners in 1887. The overall length was 12 miles. It took three years to complete and was only used for three years afterwards. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Flume) is a link to the wikipedia page about it. It's a pretty interesting read, and there's a lot more information available if you go looking for it. 




 Near Gateway, Colorado.

 Well, honestly it wasn't random. It was in response to your racist language. In the video, President Obama talks about how racism is a real issue that we still battle every day. Anyways, take care and I hope you think about what you write before you post.
