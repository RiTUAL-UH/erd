 Pure political awesomeness! 




 Amazing reporting by Kristen Chick, who followed two Syrian refugees through the Balkans to Europe.

 Bravo! What an awesome job! 




 After reading a post this morning I thought its symbolism is rather strong and it might be appropriate for the submission to TrueReddit. Individuals such as former technical director of NSA and one of the best NSA crypto-mathematicians William Binney (who helped design mass surveillance systems for the agency), Thomas Drake, Coleen Rowley, Annie Machon, Elizabeth Murray, David MacMichael, Jesselyn Radack, Todd Pierce, could always bring to light some new interesting facts, perspectives, personal thoughts about privacy, intelligence, surveillance, law enforcement, following and breaking the oath to the American Constitution. 







































 What a great   hard work, mate! 















































































 Bravo! What a mindblowing body transformation! (it has to feel pretty awesome.:) 









 Bless you, mate! It happened to me once, many years ago - it was so frightfully vivid   real, also very physical. I started to pray Hail Mary. It helped fast. Made some explanations for myself after the event from spiritual to material/medical, but that's all. It hasn't repeated after, maybe because I felt somehow 'prepared for the next time', if it comes. Have a great Sunday! 







































 From goodlooking to uberhandsome ... what an awesome work, mate!
