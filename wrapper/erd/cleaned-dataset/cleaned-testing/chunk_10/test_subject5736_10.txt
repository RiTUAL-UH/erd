 So I find with most of the books that I read, i read the text but i don;t really retain a lot of the information. This isn't usually too big a problem because most books don;t have too many different plots/characters/etc. However I'm currently reading the Silmarillion, and dear God is there a lot of information. Does anyone have any tricks on how to retain the information that you read better? 




 I'm trying to jailbreak my iphone 5s running on 8.4 but the TaiG installer is telling me "Apple driver hasn't been found. Please download and install iTunes". I don't really feel like re-installing itunes and having to go through ratings and playlists again. Does anyone know of a fix for this? 









 This is actually a very good analogy, I think this one would be a bit more controversial because we talk about pizza a lot more than planets (says something about society doesn't it). Change is good but change is hard I guess.  




 In my mind its simple, it is a dwarf planet, based upon new information that wasn't available when it was first discovered. Things change, we have to adapt. If you still consider Pluto a planet, why? (besides the fact that you like it, or want it to be a planet, that holds no scientific meaning) 









 When are you no longer a beginner? I've been lifting for a while now, saw good progression at first but it hasn't been as fast recently. 




 So I'm just starting to follow the beginner PPL Routine (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) and it says to add weight linearly 

    2.5kg/5lbs for upper body lifts (bench press, row, overhead press)
    2.5kg/5lbs for squats
    5kg/10lbs for deadlifts

I'm assuming this means add this to only the first lift of the day and with thew accessory lifts increase the weight when i can do the max number of reps per set in the specified range. 5 Pounds per week seems like a lot for bench though, I've only managed to up it by about 10 pounds in the past 2 months (not following this routine albeit). Is that really feasible while eating at a 700ish cal deficit since I'm on a cut?
 




 Would you be able to do another quick colour edit? Getting this as a tattoo soon and trying to decide on what mix of colour and black. 




 I work 9-3 Saturdays and I think I'll bring along a gym bag and if i have energy hit the gym for legs after work. Thanks for all your help, hopefully the next two months can show as much progress as the last two. I think between changing up my routine and adding some HIIT i can really get some good results before i start my first bulk in the October (that's the plan at least). 




 I really like the look of the beginner PPL (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) . I'm wondering if I could do a PPLPP and still see good results? I'm really set on working out on every weekday because it fits really nicely into my schedule and I like my weekends to relax. I have a pretty good base for legs already from running and cross country skiing.
