 Basically the trades that would make people say, "Yea, that makes total sense."

Edit:  Mention the teams involved.  Not just the players/coaches/assets/etc. 














 If you don't know who your starter is (or the team you're trading with)... explain which QB(s) will be the starter(s).

Edit...If you're feeling frisky... go ahead and reallocate the starting four QBs in your division... everyone playing for a different team.

 Yes, you are allowed to paste in pictures, but the real winners just use brushes and love of the artform.

 The outfits aren't revealing enough.  I need this to be Ghostbustier.  I hope Anna Kendrick plays Slimer. 




 Not the city, the name of the team like Lions, Raiders, etc. 




 Besides the fact that half of his game pieces have been dunked in milk.... oh the smell...

Edit:  And yes, Indiana John is good.  I want to play Trajan with him, 'cause I've never played it.  :( 




 Already have a film treatment entitled:  Charlie and the Chewy, Chunky, Chocolate Chase.

In the film, Charlie stumbles upon forbidden recipes that Willy Wonka left behind (and hid rather well), and worldwide catastrophes ensure thereafter (which a supposedly dead Willy Wonka seems to not be as dead as he's supposed to be).

Matthew Lewis (Neville from Harry Potter films) plays Charlie and multiple actors play "Willy Wonka", but the main one is Domhnall Gleeson.  The way Willy Wonka is portrayed/played/hinted at/etc is more complicated than that.  

Lots of in camera tricks and practical effects like Coppola's Dracula.  Very, very limited use of CG for a few things that would be impossible with traditional special effects, but would go unnoticed as a non-effect.

The story is not so much about Charlie's hubris (as he never really had high levels of that).  It's more about Charlie trying to recapture his childhood.  Trying not to let go of it.

Edit:  Yes, there are songs.  Yes, Oompa Loompas dance and sing.  No, I'm not incorporating much of the Roald Dahl's sequel "Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator" in the film as I prefer the gritty, ominous, innocently hopeful, humorously terrifying reality of the 1971 film.  It's more a spiritual sequel to that film while interweaving more of Dahl's joyous (though morbid) sensibilities.  Spoilers - [Early drafts of the book pointed to child murder, cannibalism, and other atrocities.  I like how the film hints at horrible fates, though obviously Wonka says in the end that they'll be "restored to their normal, terrible old selves."  In my film, people outside the factory are as strange as they were in the first film, obsessed with chocolate, randomly singing, etc.  The big secret of my film treatment is the mysterious Willy Wonka that seems to be sneaking around really is Charlie (played by Domhnall Gleeson).  Matthew Lewis is just one of Charlie's poor childhood friends.  Charlie didn't feel right that just his family got to live happily ever after, so he brought lots of poor families in with him and they all run the plant and the Oompa Loompas that wanted to leave could go. Matthew Lewis is just a diversion like Slugworth.  They create this crazy story involving secret recipes, international espionage, competing companies, mysterious Wonka sightings, and missing children to preserve the imagination of their childhoods.  I might add more on here if I get bored but so little to write and so much time...](/spoiler) 




 Clever and serious answers are welcomed.

 Wonderful, flawed, vibrant, unique film.  William Forsythe = perfect casting.  Worth watching for the art direction alone.  Would love to see more comic book movies embrace more aspects of their source material besides characters and story lines.   




 Was perusing [Wikipedia's NBA Champions list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_champions#NBA_champions) while energetically bored, so here's some interesting info which I assume is mostly correct... will edit if I discover errors.


* Since the inception of the NBA Championship in 1950, [42](http://i.imgur.com/4MbRqnD.jpg) Finals teams held the season's best record in terms of wins/losses. (43 if you count this year's Golden State Warriors)


* 31 of those teams won the championship.


* 7 of those teams lost the championship.


* 4 of those teams were in Finals where both teams had the same (top regular season) record.  In 1955, the Syracuse Nationals beat the Fort Wayne Pistons... and in 1998, the Chicago Bulls beat the Utah Jazz. (and yes, I didn't include them in the percentage.. it's like 78.5% if you include them, but I was more curious about when a best-record team faces a non-best-record team)


* In 1975, the East's 2nd seed Washington Bullets lost to the West's 1st seed Golden State Warriors.  Interestingly enough, the Bullets had a better record than the Warriors and tied the Boston Celtics (East's 1st seed) for the best regular season record that year.


* The last time a Finals team with the lone best record lost the championship was in 1993 when Phoenix Suns lost to the Chicago Bulls.


* [Lebron](http://i.imgur.com/HEfegqC.jpg) has only played on one Finals team that held the best regular season record (2013)...  his second ring.


* Four of [Jordan](http://i.imgur.com/mlEPhJZ.jpg)'s Finals teams held the best record (with the obvious 1998 Jazz tie caveat).  His other two Finals teams were his first trip to the championship and the third where he beat the season's best team (by record), [Charles Barkley](http://i.imgur.com/LDGbj7E.jpg)'s Phoenix Suns.


* Since 2000, only 6 Finals teams held the best regular season record (including this year's Warriors), and yes, the five others won the championship.  Though interestingly enough, if the Warriors win the Finals this year, it will be 3 best-record champs in a row.

If I think of more, I'll add them below.  Peruse the [Wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_champions#NBA_champions) and other sources of NBA info and let's see what else we can come up with!

Edit: Yay for bullet points! 




 Rodgers, Brady, P. Manning, E. Manning, and Brees will never win another Super Bowl.


Roethlisberger will win two more.


Tannehill will win three total over a long career.


Bridgewater gets one SB win in the next 5 years then another win in the twilight of his career.  


Luck gets one win total like Peyton.


Romo never plays in a Super Bowl.


Flacco, Ryan, and Rivers fade quickly over the coming years.


Wilson plays in another SB as a backup on another team.  Loses.


Jacksonville plays in two Super Bowls in the next ten years.


Matthew Stafford throws a TD to Tim Tebow at least once during his career.


Two players will die during NFL games over the next ten years.  One on the field in a tragic awkward-tackling accident.  The other is assassinated. 




 A similar NBA post of mine elicited interesting comments, so I wanted to get your guys' unpopular opinions as well.  Looking for those views, thoughts, assumptions, predictions, assessments, etc that may rile up others but you definitely believe.  Be sure not to downvote because you disagree.  Instead of downvoting, make a comment! 














 Warriors win it all 4-1. Curry is MVP. LeBron gives a decent but underwhelming performance. Blatt is blamed for strange substitutions at the end of games.  Love leaves for LA. LeBron instagrams something misconstrued as racist against Love, then tweets something that makes it worse, and then loses sponsorships. LeBron has a tearful press conference where he talks about race, basketball, fame, and family. People forgive him, and many see the incident as media-created (and don't believe LeBron is actually racist). The Cavs barely make the playoffs next year, as the East is suprisingly stronger. Bucks win next year's Finals over the Thunder 4-3 in what is considered the best NBA Finals ever. KD goes to the Wizards and Westbrook goes to LA. LA never does much in the playoffs and the Wizards eventually win two championships. Westbrook eventually wins a title as a bench player with the Celtics before retiring. 

 




 I've listened to their show from time to time, and am waiting for my laundry to dry, so here's my "one big thing" collection of random thoughts.

SVP always seemed like the princess and the pea.  Too fussy and full of himself.

Rusillo usually has more interesting takes, but seems to suffer from a pseudo-arrogant "I went to the wrong fraternity and didn't get with enough girls back then and am getting older and all my friends are married to hotties and I'm not sure if people tune in to listen to just SVP and just tolerate me" mentality.

But, besides all of that, they are the best ESPN radio show by a sizable degree.

SVP's late night show may work.  Matters how curmudgeony he is.  If he just has fun with it and carves a new niche where he's not a fuss-pot, then it may have legs.  He doesn't have even half of Letterman's charisma, wit, intelligence, and knowledge base, so I think just being the "tall cynical guy who knows Tiger Woods" won't be enough.

Rusillo on the other hand, who knows.  I assume he doesn't want to just chill in that time slot with that Virk guy or whomever.  Virk still needs to apologize for littering throughout the U.S.  He talked about it on the show for awhile and seemed to imply zero regret while laughing about it.  He's low-end talent that needs to bake awhile longer in the basement of ESPN News for awhile until he actually can play with the big boys and girls.

Speaking of girls, I would love to see more female hosts and anchors.  Jackie MacMullan is one of my favorite ESPN personalities, though she's not on Around the Horn enough.  She guest hosted His and Hers recently.  I wish she was a daily, permanent presence on ESPN.

Back to Rusillo.  He may bolt and join Bill Simmons, doing whatever he's doing next, but I think money may keep him with ESPN as an NBA analyst/radio host/etc.  

Also that guy who doesn't believe in dinosaurs seems like a bully.

Oooo.  My laundry is dry.  Go Pacers/Pistons!
