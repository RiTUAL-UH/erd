I'll follow you on tumblr, but it won't be my art blog, because that's a secondary blog.  









 Man, I plan on moving to SLC, Utah, once I having the funds. I'm a freelance artist, but since I'm not getting any work, I'm gonna have to a get a "real" job. Hearing what you said really worries me. Do you think, if I ever get a job interview, that I should lie, if I'm subtly asked about my religion and say I'm Mormon?  




 For me, it's all of the different sounds. For example, the droid that answers the door to Jaba's Palace, it just sounds cool! I love that different droids sorta have their own indistinguishable languages. It makes some of them sound gritty and depth to their worlds. Another sound I enjoy is when a big ship, like a cruiser, is heavily under attack, or very badly damaged, they make that sorta "arooga" sound(I hope that makes sense. That's what I hear, at least). Lastly. hearing the range of emotion in R2's beeps. 
I love it!  









 Thank you so much, I appreciate it. 




 I love the movie "Her". I think Scarlett was perfect for that role. Her voice is just so captivating to me.  









 I have very terrible anxiety issues. I honestly don't think I could handle taking a bus or riding a train, as pathetic as that sounds. That's a main reason why I'm trying to hard to get my own vehicle.  




 Thank you! I appreciate it!  




 Thank you so much!
