 Hello, /r/books;
I'm a big fan of the Southern Gothic genre. If you're also a fan, I would love to know what you think are the best entries and authors in the genre.  Are you an old school Faulkner fan? A literary allegeoran McCarthy fan? Are you keeping it lighter with Ron Rash? Rolling wordy and atmospheric with Daniel Woodrell? Tell me all about it! :) 




 Movie night KILLED ME.  Seriously.  I blubber just REMEMBERING it... These filmmakers, I tell yah!  




 Well, with the seven or so upvotes and five or so downvotes, it seems to be controversial enough!  Thanks for the props, I kind of knew going in it wasn't going to be a piece of cake, redditors seem to really like McCarthy's work.  

The truth is that I'm frustrated.  I set out to read all of his novels based upon the hype that he's the greatest living author today and a writer's writer.  I absolutely hate that there is something wrong with me that stops me from having any of the four novels I've finished resonate with me.  I'm beginning to come to the conclusion that I don't have the ability to postulate emotions without pointers from the author.  I'm also sad because a lot of the premises sound so wonderful, and seem to me to have such potential for wide emotional range and exploration of human nature, but I can't find that in the way he is writing.  Now again, I acknowledge that this is my short coming.  Still, I feel discouraged and like I'm missing out on something really great.  Hopefully the more aggressive folks in this thread don't see this and rip me a new one ;)          




 Do you have any board games to recommend for 2 players?  I'm looking for something specifically designed for 2, not a span of players where it is inevitably better with three or four folks.  Thank you! :) 




 Well, this is a privately owned website, meaning that you are not entitled to "freedom of speech" here.  I guess I'm confused about why you would expect it to be a pantheon of free expression, so there's your question: Why do you think you should be able to say or create whatever you want on a privately owned platform?  

I recommend you move on over to 8ch.net, seems more your speed. 
 




 I recommend a re-read of something familiar and warm, like the Phantom Tollbooth.  I needed a palette cleanser as it actually could've spiraled off into a depression.  I mean, it's great that a work of literature can make you feel so much, but you have to live your life afterwards and if you can't stop thinking about how your mom and your sister have organs, it makes it a bit difficult.  

I would recommend the film, absolutely.  Maybe watch that then move on.   




 I agree, this one left me utterly devastated for about a week afterwards.  The film was a very good adaptation, but it added these additional little knife twists, I cried pretty much start to finish since I'd already read the book before I saw it.  This book is definitely a catalyst for an existential crisis.  I've re-read it only once more.  It's just too sad.   




 You're absolutely right, thank you for pointing that out.  




 Here is the source you requested regarding writing about life and death: http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/17/specials/mccarthy-venom.html

Here is the source you requested on infant mortality rates in 1850: http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc2.ark:/13960/t4qj7qt8w Now this alone, of course, doesn't stand by itself.  We need to consider the number of people in the settlement, the fact that we're only babies for about two years of our lives in coordination with the mortality rate. 

Your rebuttal merely boils down to the second sentence you wrote.  

I have a few corrections.  

I did not have a visceral reaction to the baby killing, my disgust is that he thinks his audience is so easy to manipulate.  

The robin gets away from the baby, and the argument isn't that the baby did a horrible thing, it's that the baby did something that isn't even possible for a baby to do.  The creative license taken with a baby's coordination for the purpose of a morbid action.  Why?

In response to your section about the Road: Does it make any sense to have a farm of "animals" that have a gestation period of 9 months?  Absolutely not.  A baby will feed you for how many days, sir?  I'm sorry, you've failed to convince me that this makes any sense. 

Telling me I don't have to read things and that I'm wrong isn't a rebuttal...and these were presented as my opinions.  Please check out /u/Deus_Fax_Machina as an example of what I'm looking for.     




 I found this to be a very compelling read; thank you for your thoughtful contribution.  That the point was not realism certainly puts things in a different light and makes a lot of sense in the context that the book is an homage to Moby Dick.   




 I have upvoted you for telling me something I was unaware of.  That I know of now, we have baby killing in 4 out of 10 (admittedly, I haven't read them ALL, so there could very well be more) novels.  I've seen the death of an infant done well, but I've never seen it become a career-wide trend.  It seems totally inappropriate to me that this is something he comes back to again and again.     




 Has anyone actually asked Cormac McCarthy why he hates babies so much?  

Is ANY of this baby killing necessary?  Does it ever add?  Or is it just a cheap parlor trick he thinks hes entitled to in the same way hes entitled to write pages upon pages of Spanish with no translation?  Or in the same way he has the right to look down his nose at authors who deal with issues of life and death (Id NEVER describe his work as that I mean, no one EVER DIES in his books, right?)  I dont get it.  And beyond the baby killing, whats with the absolute venom he uses when describing said babies?  I mean, one could argue thats Lester talking when he describes the baby as a drooling little monster, but lets be real here, he underlines that this is what he really thinks by giving this baby supernatural coordination so he can capture a robin and rip its legs off with his mouth  You ever tried to catch a bird with your hands before?  Its almost impossible no baby that is still drooling on itself is capable of that kind of magic.   

Which brings up my next point Why is this guy lauded as the greatest of our time when he writes all these totally implausible scenarios?  A TREE of dead babieshow many babies were surviving in a small settlement during that time period?  Surely not enough to decorate a tree with!  Heres another: in a post-apocalyptic society, there would be not medical services.  Maternal and infant death rates would skyrocket.  If a baby DID manage to make it out unscathed, we wouldnt barbeque it!  Its too precious!  A mothers body is built to feed that baby during famine regardless of how hungry she is... If the mother is dead, a woman can actually start lactation by repeated attempts to feed the child There is NO REASON to believe we would be eating babies.  Dogs and even adults make more sense.  It seems (brace yourself) SLOPPY.  Just like the lack of proper punctuation seems LAZY (Please dont jump in with that oral tradition argument, the man himself says [Theres no reason to clutter up the page with a bunch of stupid dots] He doesnt even try to defend himself reasonably like his fans do).  And just like pages and pages of Spanish in the middle of an English language novel is SELF INDULGENT.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.  This is what the protagonist would hear as he would hear it, but the point of fiction isnt to be a faithful record it never actually happened, so there is no way for it to be a faithful record the point of fiction is to be read, and if we cant comprehend what were reading, then the point is missed.  The story is lost.   

Am I crazy here?  Can someone write a good rebuttal as to why we need a dead baby to make a good Cormac McCarthy novel? 




 If you like southern gothic, the Charles Frazier novel Nightwoods contains this element you speak of.  In fact, it moves back and forth like that a few times.  I was initially disappointed with this novel having picked it up shortly after reading Daniel Woodrell's Winter's Bone; but since re-reading it twice, I've come to really love it.   




 Well, the other important thing that your savvy responder didn't mention is that tax situations vary widely person to person.  We get to choose how many allowances to take or not take, whether to withhold as single, married, or married but at a single rate... some of us are even tax exempt.  Your salary in your area is a status marker, for while I may choose to funnel funds every which-way, if I say I make $50,000, you know I'm a semi big deal (if I'm young) or I've been working for many, many years at a not-so impressive job (if I'm older).  If I say I'm making $100,000 you can deduce things about me, and if I say I'm making $16,000 you can deduce things about me.

Now, my salary is about $45,000 per year pre-tax.  But I have daycare costs, health insurance, and 12% for retirement drawn out automatically.  If I told you the truth, which is that my take-home is $550 a paycheck, you would draw very different conclusions about how far I am in building my career at age 28.   




 I think it depends on what your frame of reference is... you see, one US Edition (woe be to me, the one I picked up) compared Stieg Larsson to Thomas Harris.  Thomas Harris might have some failings when it comes to storylines, but he researched things meticulously and he never held back in showing us all of the things he had learned.  I went in with a certain expectation.  

It was not, in any way, satisfied.  I'd give it 1/4 stars.   




 I see both of the offerings for advice here is to apply the pressure to your current employer.  I hate to rain on their parades, but this almost never works.  We start working at places to build our resumes so we can move on to places that will pay us what we're actually worth.  This is exactly what your co-worker did.  In my former job, I started at the ground level.  I was promoted four times.  At the end I was traveling and giving in-person presentations to the second in command at the biggest utility company in the United States.  The irony was that my salary was less than what their entry level employees were making (a lot less, $15 an hour less).  In fact, my salary was the lowest on the team, despite the fact that I was, above and beyond, the very best person on that team.  I outstripped every single one of them on tenure within the company, I had more duties, I had more quantifiable results, and recommendations from every client I worked with.  I was actually a bargaining chip at one point.  I was running the training department and my former client threatened to pull their 11 million dollar contract with us if I did not come back and manage their account... the kid who was running it at the time?  Making more money than me.   

Finally, I got sick of working 56 hour weeks on my too-low salary.  I found another job.  A job that gave me a 12% raise from what I was making then right out of the gate.  They even hired me while I was six months pregnant.  If you know you deserve better, go out and get it.  You can go to your current employer with your offer letter and you give them the chance to match it if you want, but I think you'll find it feels a lot better to work with people who appreciate you.     




 Ready for battle! 




 That was literally my reaction upon reading Peter Straub's the Buffalo Hunters from his collection "A Room without Doors," which would fit in pretty nicely for this thread. The guy makes himself wallpaper out of baby bottle nipples and then rolls around against it. He also makes himself a nice nipple bedspread. It was like who agreed to publish this? Other highlights from the collection include a child learning hypnotism and using it to torture his toddler aged little brother with a hat pin and another story about skipping school to go to the movies and becoming the daily target of a pedophile.  




 I haven't, but honest to goodness, I will now. :)  




 I thought Clay's cameo in Rules of Attraction was a bit far-fetched for this reason. It just seemed really sweet to me, and that's not who he was.  




 Same. It was far fetched and weird, not disturbing, in my opinion. Completely unbelievable.  




 I'm a huge fan too! I liked Out better, I thought it was a bit tighter. I enjoyed Real World too. I hope her other books get translations soon. You should check out the Sex issue of Granta...there is a very funny short story about this woman who is the sole lady in a large group of men on a desert island. It doesn't go at all how you think it will.  




 Annnnnd subscribed! Thanks!  




 We have everything in common.  [When I read this review](http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/The-Runaways-4530.html), I was like, this guy knows my heart.  That's just how I felt watching her.  I mean, she was such a perfect choice for that role.  Mono-syllabic but still completely mesmerizing and magnetic.  




 If you're the maid of honor, I don't believe you're required to give a gift by etiquette... you're going to have to plan and fund (or figure out funding) for the bachelorette party and the bridal shower.  You're also traditionally tasked with corralling the bridesmaids to stuff like dress fittings and making sure they pay for things on time, not to mention, anything else the bride asks you to do... 

If they're not going traditional like above and you're just showing up with a gift, you should go with something sentimental and handmade.  Or get them a better version of something they already have.  I love my [Victorinox Huntsman jackknife](http://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Swiss-Huntsman-Pocket-Knife/dp/B0001P151W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1436823057 sr=8-1 keywords=victorinox+huntsman).  You could get them both one (they come in about 20 different colors) and stay in your price range. 




 I envy you. ;)  




 I'm a college drop out myself.  I also make $20k more a year than the average American woman.  I own a house, I'm married, and I have an eight month old baby.  I can afford to pay my mother for daycare, so she doesn't actually have a job outside the home.  Basically, I'm a bad ass and I regret nothing.  If you can take control of your situation and figure out what YOU want and how to get there, no one is going to look down their nose at you for not finishing school.  Success is subjective.  Your family, ultimately wants you to be happy and healthy.  There may be a bit of disappointment initially, but you need to do what you need to do to make yourself happy.  No one else is going to advocate for you.    




 Someone had bemoaned the same books coming up over and over, so being that I have an intense interest in morbid literature, here are some books you don't hear about (nearly as much):

**Zombie** - Joyce Carol Oates (She's writing a journal as Jeffrey Dahmer)

**Daddy Love** - Joyce Carol Oates (It's about a little boy who is kidnapped by a rapist and held captive for years)

**We Need to Talk about Kevin** - Lionel Shriver (Mother writes to husband about what went wrong in parenting an eventual school shooting organizer)

**Out** - Natsuo Kirino (OH SNAP, you need to read this one if you like disturbing lit... Group of women from factory help a woman dispose of the body of her abusive husband, crazy shit ensues)

**The Collector** - John Fowles (this one will kill you if you're a serious redditor... you see the main character's mentality displayed here often (man wins lottery, kidnaps dream girl))

**Little Star** - John Ajvide Lindqvist (Although all of his books are worth your time (Old man goes mushrooming, finds a baby half buried in the woods, instead of crying she sings out a perfect note... he decides it's his fate to raise her in his basement as a sort of musical experiment, violence ensues))

**White as Snow** - Tanith Lee (Snow White re-write)

Skip anything by Jack Ketchum.  He's about as subtle as a chainsaw, you'll just come away numb.  




 That is legitimately the only way to describe the plot of "Lullaby..." I mean, what a fucking mess.  How the hell does he come up with this stuff?  




 I'm sorry I don't understand.  Could you expand upon your comment?  




 There is seriously no such thing as being a failure... that's the great thing about being a human being, so long as you're still alive and conscious, you can change everything.  You're not going to ruin your future by dropping out.  A degree doesn't guarantee you a job... tenacity, perseverance, and high standards do.  You need to think about how you would feel if you were dying right now looked back at your life.  Do you have regrets about how miserable you're making yourself going to college?  Think about it.  Those things you regret... work to change them.  You can do it!  I believe in you!

 Hey man;

I truly believe that the only graceful way to go bald is to shave it all.  You don't need to look like a potato, just grow some facial hair or wear your glasses.  If you really don't want to go for bald, your only real recourse it to trim it very close.  Washing your hair too often is probably the culprit for the shiny scalp.  It's fine to bathe or shower every day, but you don't need to wash your hair daily.  Try skipping it a few days and see if the shine goes away.
Hope this helps! 

P.S. I'm married to a guy who has been shaving his head since he was 20.  He's 39 now.  He looks very handsome and NOTHING like a potato.  It's really more about the way you dress than what's on your head, if you look put together, you're not going to look like a slob. :) 




 I definitely encourage you to do as many high school things as you can while you can... Go to prom, go to football games, join yearbook, do everything you can... 

But if you can't make yourself be engaged with those kinds of things, take your list and work towards being every thing on it.  I bet that financial security, a home, steady income, food, I bet they're on that list in some way, shape, or form... how will you get those things if you don't have a high school education?  Beyond the basic requirements, I promise you will want THE BEST for your baby when you have one.  You're not going to want to be working towards a GED while your mother watches the baby and you're on government assistance (not that there is anything wrong with any of these things, when I was born, my mother was 21, homeless, in an abusive relationship, and on welfare).... it's just not the dream, you know?  You want your child to have a room and nice things and people she trusts and food in her belly and good Christmases... you want her to be smart and to be proud of her hardworking mother.  You want her to have a father who will build her up and make her believe she can do anything. 

I'm coming from a similar place as you.  I was the oldest child of three and my home was broken.  From the time I was three I was thinking about building a family around me that would be mine and wouldn't go away.  I was engaged at 16 years old, I got a job and saved every single dime.  I graduated high school and immediately moved cross-state to support my fianc as he went through college.  We were together for almost four years, but he became abusive and I left him.  Every year was spent obsessively looking for the perfect father for my future children.  Looking back, I regret it.  

But I've been married now for almost four years.  I have a very good job making about $20,000 more per year than the average woman in America, and I don't even have a college degree.  I have a house and two rescue dogs, and this past October, I welcomed a wonderful, healthy baby girl into the world.  I'm 28 years old.    




 I'm sorry that you're having trouble at home.  You don't deserve that kind of treatment.

To address your baby fever, I think you should sit down and make a list of all the things you would want for yourself if you could pick your ideal parents.  Be particular.  Pie in the sky, it's your dream list.

When you're done, look at your list and put a check mark next to all the things that you, personally, can provide to a baby.

Remember, that just like you, your baby can't choose its situation.  It's our responsibility to wait to have babies until we can give that child the best home we possibly can.  It's also our job to live our lives and have fun and to learn while we have the chance so we can use our rich experiences to stay engaged and enlighten our children once we have them.  Don't rush.  You have your whole life to be an adult and you will never be this young again.  Don't jump into being an adult, there is time for that.  So much time.  But this, this will never be again.   




 My advice is actually to sign on with a temp company. Temp companies are used to extremely high employee turnover, so they tend to skip doing background checks. Because a temp agency is supposed to run a background check, the company you are matched with will likely not do one. This is how my former company ended up with several level 1 sex offenders on the payroll. Let my disturbing experience be your boon! Best of luck to you... It's awesome that you're so driven. :) 




 If I were you, I would just borrow a ring she already has lying around that fits, bring it to a jewelry shop in town, and ask what size it is.  The charts are subject to user error because of print settings.   




 Sorry if this is a stupid question, but my rescue dog came to us with an enuculeation.. his face doesn't have any visible scarring or trauma, he just looks like he is winking all the time.  I don't want to bother any one, can you okay my dog?  http://i.imgur.com/OVztj69.jpg 




 Well, I'm not familiar (obviously, ahaha!) with the internal structure of your company, but here in my part of the world, we have procedures written for all important processes... anyone is free to suggest improvements to the VPs who run those departments.  Is it possible you could bring up this requirement as positively and humbly as possible to the person in charge of the marketing department?  I think if you spin it in the right (earnest, self-deprecating, company-minded) way, it will be well-received.   




 /u/late_night_grumbler He's pithy and hilarious and prolific.  He calls out the blatant pandering.  He's fair.  He's omniscient.  He circulates photos of Oscar the Grouch as gratuitous photos of himself... Yay for Grumbler.   




 Well, and how many people do you meet in your life that you think are good enough to marry?  It takes a long time for people when they have no limitation to their dating pool.  What are the odds that when you finally DO meet someone with Dwarfism that you are going to have one damn common interest with them?  It's beyond silly to have this expectation for you.  You do what you're doing!  I support you!  




 There it is!  I personally think she deserves an Oscar merely on merit of being able to perform in Twilight without busting into gales of laughter.  I know I couldn't.  That shit was ridiculous!  




 I'm not sure why you need to be tactful about it, I know at my work, people aren't... I just get back an e-mail saying "I made some edits, find attachment."

If you're asking because you're not in a position to be correcting the person's grammar due to org chart stuff, then you bring your edits to someone who is.  Just shoot their supervisor an e-mail stating that you found some errors but didn't think it was appropriate to bring them up being that you are in another department.  




 Well, thanks to an uneventful weekend and FX, I'll say she did the best she could with the material given to her... I mean, what the hell can you do when you are written a line like "You nick-named my child after the Loch Ness Monster?"  She had roles before and after!  This seems very insufficient to me.    




 My mother in law.  She's a terribly insecure person and it manifests in ways that would make me cut out any one else.   




 Kristen Stewart. I seriously don't understand the vitriol she draws on reddit... I mean, I bet the average redditor hasn't seen the Runaways, so maybe that's the closest thing I have to a theory. Can someone explain this to me? Where are these imaginary hoards of people who worship the ground she walks on? Because I never hear accolades that make her worthy of detraction...  




 Sounds to me like you should look into food service.  A lot of restaurants hire seasonal wait staff due to increased tourist traffic in the summer.  Dishwashers too if you're the shy type.  It's not going to be a whole lot of fun, but it's not hard to win a job. :) Good luck!  




 Show off your skills.... the truth is that on-paper qualifications just equate to higher starting pay... a lot of companies would prefer to pay you less for unofficial skills.  Go some place that you can get in at the ground level, but has a great ladder to climb.  




 You'll find that almost anything required in a job posting is open to negotiation depending upon your other good attributes.  I work as the executive assistant to the CEO and her Vice Presidents.  The job posting required two years of secretarial experience.  I did not have this.  They still hired me despite the fact that I was 6 months pregnant and would just have to be out for 3 months for maternity leave.  I've been here almost a year now!  I'm glad I took the risk, having really wanted the job. :)   




 Re-reading might be more your cup of tea.  Getting through a book used to be a challenge for me, but I loved to re-read things I did make it through.  I eventually grew out of it being difficult to finish things, but I'm still an avid re-reader. :)  




 Sorry, in searching his name the most recent thing I found was talk of a documentary 2 months ago... this didn't come up in that thread.  I swear, I'm not being some shameless re-poster.  




 I don't know if this counts, but that line in the movie Ghost World "He better be careful or he'll get AIDs when he date rapes her.." is pretty damn savage.   




 I bought my mom's husband a subscription to CRAWL magazine for his birthday.  He's a very quiet mountain man type.  He sent me this very poorly punctuated text message that said "Got my first crawl mag today. thanks georgia. if your car pulls to one side or the other when you brake, let me know, il put pads on the other side next time." 




 I just don't even follow the line of logic here.... like so he's walking around all sloth like and doesn't have much to say... you already know off his meds he killed both of your family dogs... How, HOW is that behavior preferable to him being slovenly and uncommunicative? 




 We have *everything* in common.... "Dale Denton... You're my hero..." 




 This is just how I feel... I think his mother should have faced charges for taking him off his medications... I mean.... What the hell was she thinking?  




 Well, it's passed-out drunk to begin with, then it's restrained once it wakes up... I mean, it's just totally weird... The whole thing is weird... But I would imagine if I were a lady with a pig's face and people were paying to see how ugly I am, I'd be agitated too...so it works.   




 Yeah, having worked in a 4,000 sq. foot call center, the equivalent of this for me was people who refused to sit down.  Like, listen man, we have cubicles because they block the noise... it doesn't work if you stand up.  SIT DOWN.  

Oh, and the whistlers and fiddlers... I used to sit next to this dumbass who would spend his whole day throwing a Snapple cap at the place where his keyboard met his desk... like, we are all on the phone... WHY are you making noise for the sake of making noise?!!!?!?!?!!?? 




 [Pig-Faced Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig-faced_women)

Favorite excerpt:The pig-faced women exhibited at fairs were not genuine. Showmen would drug a bear into a stupor by feeding it large amounts of strong beer, and then shave it.[60] Once shaved, the drunken bear would be fitted with padded artificial breasts, and dressed in women's clothing and a wig. Shoes would be attached to the bear's hind paws, and stuffed gloves to the front paws. The bear would then be placed in a chair with a hole in the back, and securely tied to the chair.[33]

Although, the bit about that heiress who couldn't dispel rumors that she WAS ONE even by appearing in public was pretty good too....

Actually, pretty much any line from Pineapple express stands alone to me.   




 Hello, fellow subscribers. I'm reading Vampire: The Richard Chase murders, and right off the bat the author is going on and on about how evil Chase was... It was my understanding that he was a paranoid schizophrenic in a time when mental disorders were poorly understood... This author stands by the court findings that he was not insane (because he was paranoid? Uhhh...), but what do you think? Was Richard Case a sick man who went off his medication to great detriment, or was he a fully firing (I hate this word) sociopath?

 I think probably /r/morbidquestions

He was pretty bright and would probably enjoy typing out lots of gross postulations.  




 I like to save questions that strike me as funny.  Here they are so far: 

If you were committing suicide by hanging, and your pants fell down half way through... would you try to rescue yourself or just let people assume you died during a really badly done attempt at auto-erotic asphyxiation?

Your body is made of utterly delicious Candy. What wouldn't you mind eating?

 There was this disgruntled guy who was angry about something that happened many years ago with his utility company.  Several times a day, he would call the appliance repair line and then blow into the phone as hard as he could four times before hanging up.  It was damn near deafening... If you did a reverse search for his phone number in the system you could see he had been doing this since 2007.  They called him "Mr. Raspberry." 




 You don't know that.  People also once thought he was bleaching his skin to be white and lying about having a skin disorder... Well, guess what... Autopsy confirms he wasn't lying.  It's not even possible to bleach yourself from black to white.  The guy had a frozen development.  Billie Jean is ABOUT sex phobia for crying outloud.  All his babies were CREATED.

 I see what you did there, but I guess I'm more of a Michael Bolton than a Peter.  Why should I change? He's the one that sucks...  




 I have mad respect for people who can subject themselves to roadwork... it's back breaking, you're at the mercy of the weather, and assholes whiz through your work place at unsafe speeds all day.

 I'd be one year older than I am now!  Wow, the future is so... uh.... underwhelming.  It seems the same to me.  Huh.  




 Hopefully it's one (1) genuine turnpike tollbooth for use in lands beyond.  




 Yeah, this movie made me question my worth as a human being... Renner was so sympathetic, I couldn't empathize with the victims properly.

I have to disagree with you on one point though... "More, More, More," playing during the date-rape montage was one of the more memorable music moments in cinema to me.  I laugh every time.  Redemption +1.    




 Well, I'm a put-on-a-show kind of girl... don't like the backseat... gotta be first.  




 There are two types of people in this world...  




 Miss my poor mother, dead too young from cancer.  And read Jane Austen novels.   




 A tire pressure gauge.  I keep the lock de-icer in my purse in the winter months.  Also at least one plastic bag incase I have to drive someone somewhere for work... so I can pretend to not be a total slob by stuffing everything into a plastic bag that I can then throw in the trunk.  Also, an ink pen and at least $2.00 in quarters for parking meters.  My proof of car insurance.   




 Calm down, Turtle.  She didn't say you were lying.  Let's just stay cool.  




 A great bed.  You spend 1/3 of your life there... more time than you do in your car... Splurge on your bed!!!  




 This was twelve kinds of brilliant.  There is a reason you're on my reddit friends list-- You never disappoint.  




 Hi... Here's how my experience was... The baby was born, they held her up to have her umbilical cord cut by my husband.  He said it was squishy, but incredibly tough to cut through. Then the baby was immediately put on my chest.  She wasn't even very wet.  They put my legs up in stirrups.  A bunch of personnel came to inspect my poor lady bits.  They assisted me in delivering the placenta (they tug gently on the umbilical cord while you push) they ask you if you want to inspect it (not kidding).  They took the baby from me, wrapped her up, popped a hat on her, and then gave her to my husband while they repaired a tear (gave me stitches for 30 minutes while my legs shook from shock and exertion).  When my husband held the baby the first time, he looked down at her face very seriously, and then he started smiling bigger and bigger.  It was such a great moment, it made me cry.   




 Me again... Have you ever eaten at Nandos?  If so, was it cheeky?  Or are you not posh enough for eating at a fast food chain to be cheeky?  ;)

P.S. Are you a lad?  




 As an American, I don't think we need to give the world another reason to think we're egomaniacal... Amirite? 




 I'm a girl... this has been a very productive conversation here.  I may have to make it my life's goal to celebrate a birthday in England so I, too, can be king (queen?) for a day.  




 Wait... do you mean it is always appropriate, that there are 80 year old men walking about in construction paper crowns on their birthdays.... or do you mean that you have no idea why I think British folks wear crowns on their birthdays?  




 Are you pulling my leg right now?  




 At what age is the paper crown and "king for a day" inappropriate?  




 I second this... Why is it that so many people post these, and are totally incommunicado after 55 minutes?  It's very disappointing!  




 [John Brennan Crutchley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brennan_Crutchley) participated in orgies, partner swapping, frequented sex clubs.  




 I hope you're able to look beyond the terrible writing, because it is at times, painful.  The very first page is a ridiculous narrative about his "insatiable hunger" that he then "sates..." Uh... you said it was insatiable... Later on during the recounting of the rape of Christina Almah, the author actually describes her thighs as "silky.." like this is some damn letter to Penthouse.  I could go on and on, but I won't.     




 Conspiracy Theory Time: I think they only show these photos taken of him shortly before his death in 2002 because they're more in line with what we imagine when we think of a serial killer.  He was actually very conventionally attractive when he was active, that is how he got so many ladies to sleep with him... He kept an index card system with over 74 women he had sex with, and that, for the most part, did not include his victims.  [Here is what he looked like at the time of the escape of Christina Almah.](http://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/crutchley-vampires.jpg)

It's a polymerization of oil to create a protective coat. On the how, please see my link inside that link. It will protect the metal from rust.

Although, it is absolutely none of your business what I choose to spend my money on.  




 You're not paying attention. This has already been addressed twice by me in this very same thread.  




 Right, it's a date of manufacture indicator for a Griswold skillet. 




 Apparently no one cares about Sir Anthony:

The knowledge that Anthony Hopkins had a short-lived career in the 1980's as a pop star. Here is his one and only single: [1986's Distant Star.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cz_mNW6S_w) You're welcome.

 [Here you go, friend.](http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/a-science-based-technique-for-seasoning-cast-iron/)

But to explain like you're five, seasoning is taking a non-coated cast iron pan, rubbing it with oil, cooking it in the oven so the oil becomes hard, taking it out, cooling it, repeating until it is shiny, smooth, and black.  This protects your cast iron from rust, and makes it less likely to have food stick to it.  




 [Here you go, friend.](http://www.moolanomy.com/5432/investing-in-collectibles-what-makes-a-collectible-valuable-mmarquit01/)  I don't have a great answer for you... it's all superstition, preference, and theory.  




 You're going to find that cast iron is one of those more controversial hobbies where everyone has a theory and no one has a definitive answer but that doesn't stop them from attacking each other.  The way that I do it (which is all I can tell you) is to use kosher salt and water to grind away any stuck on mess.  Once I have all the debris off of it, I put it in the oven at 200 degrees for 30 minutes to ensure it is completely dry.  The last thing I do is to very, VERY lightly oil it with a prop of olive oil.  It should be shiny, but not feel greasy.  I hope this helps... 

Edit: You need to let the pan cool to room temp before oiling it and putting it away some place dry.  I should have specified... don't try to oil it while it's hot! :) 




 You might find what you're looking for here (Sorry, I didn't pre-screen, I'm trying to find a source for iron composition changes in manufacturing, and though I know I had a great time line I'd found in 2011, I am having the damnedest time finding it again.): 

Howdy David,
Well, you sure stirred up a storm with that question. The information I used was based on discussions with chemists, pieces written by chemists, and papers on the heat polymerization of oils in general (similar to drying oils but at elevated temperatures). When I went to look for a citation that specifically said here is what is going on in a cast iron pan, I couldnt find any. I spoke to McGee. He doesnt remember his conversation with you but we have vowed to run down the problem together.
Here is the Royal Chemical Society speculating about oil polymerization: http://www.rsc.org/education/teachers/learnnet/kitchenchemistry/docs/SS10.doc
Here is a (somwaht irrelevant) paper on the thermal gelation of thin oil films: http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/bitstream/10113/24641/1/IND23253053.pdf

 I didn't buy it recently, I have Creddits pre Chooting... I didn't buy 12 to give out all in one shot.  




 Are you looking for a source about cast iron components or are you looking for a source on what to look for when shopping for a high-quality Griswold? 




 Please house me when I move to your glorious country that has all-day breakfast at McDonald's.... here in Hamburger-a-gogo land, the breakfast dream ends at 10:30 on weekdays and 11:00 on weekends.  I want a Sausage burrito during my IF Window in the evening...  




 Oh, is it gender exclusive to prepare something all genders need to survive?  I thought it was just common sense to learn how to cook your own food.   




 Finally.... the best response.. I can't conceive of one better.  Good for you, have some Gold.  




 I like things that make me laugh.  True things are the funniest.... the best thing I recently guilded was a response to something like "What do you get a lot of unjustified hate for?" and this 14 year old kid said "Listening to Eminem and jailbreaking my phone."  I loved that!  Ahahaha!  




 Lol.... Georgie Pie is a defunct fast food chain... Not a washed up boxer.  




 Sure, alloys make a big difference though... you'll notice my reply started with the words "You're only partially right here..." not "Wrong, man!"
