 I've tried craigslist, but there's a lot of bs you have to sift through order to find what you're looking for. Roommates.com doesn't have very many people in the area I'm moving to and you have to pay to use it. What other options are out there? 




 At our store, we're more concerned about a candidate's ability to drive sales, get along with coworkers and provide good customer service to our customers than we are about their knowledge of books. Our interview questions generally begin with, "Describe a time when..." We carry 2 million titles in the store, so even the most voracious reader won't be very familiar with the vast majority of what we sell. We're looking for team players who are friendly to customers and don't shy away from the selling aspect of the job (we are there to make money, after all). Good luck!  




 Is it for Barnes and Noble? I'm a manager and can let you know what to expect?  




 If you think Blood Meridian is the best book you've ever read, just wait until the ending. Then you'll *know* it's the best book you've ever read.  




 Realized as soon as I clicked "submit". Hoped no one would notice.  




 I always do this. A few chapters into a new book I'll hear or read about a different book and I just can't wait to read it. So much so that the book I'm currently on becomes more of a chore than a pleasure.  




 I love [this beef stew recipe]( http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/15ggl9/the_ultimate_well_my_favourite_beef_stew_recipe/?). Only I use green beans instead of peas and I add worcestshire sauce.

 Just who is he tying to pander to here. This seems like a statement that, even if you believe it, is better left unsaid, especially for a politician.  




 I'm sure many of you either participated in or at least saw the Facebook event last Saturday for a letter writing campaign. The goal was to get as many Bernie supporters as possible to write a letter to the editor of their local paper stating why they support him for president. This was a fun and quick (most newspapers have a 200 word limit) way to potentially reach a lot of people. 


Why don't we do the same thing, but send the letters to various papers in Iowa? I guess the letters are supposed to be submitted by locals, but I don't think that's a requirement. Imagine if, this Sunday, every newspaper in Iowa has at least one letter to the editor in support of Bernie Sanders. That could potentially make a difference in the race.  




 Unfortunately, that woman's views are quite common here. This is the most conservative county in California.

The formatting is a little weird, but it finally made it into the paper, albeit on a Tuesday where it will be seen by literally dozens of people. 
 




 I'm no political scientist, but I suspect Iowa is hugely important for Hillary because New Hampshire is likely to be won by Bernie. If he wins Iowa and then wins New Hampshire, it could be devastating for Hillary.  




 Two nights ago it was in the 5000s.  




 I think the rating would only make a difference if it cracked the top 10. Since it's one of the top political books right now though, it might appear on random Amazon users' pages if they are buying similar books.  




 You mean the audio book ;-) 




 Lol what's dialling long distance?  




 The book is called *[The Speech]( http://www.amazon.com/Speech-Historic-Filibuster-Corporate-Decline/dp/1568586841/ref=sr_1_1?s=books amp;amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF8 amp;amp;amp;amp;qid=1436225392 amp;amp;amp;amp;sr=1-1 amp;amp;amp;amp;keywords=the+speech amp;amp;amp;amp;pebp=1436225399941 amp;amp;amp;amp;perid=07DT3YP2MBYN1BBA8K1T#featureBulletsAndDetailBullets_secondary_view_div_1436226426666)* and is the publication of an 8 hour long filibuster Senator Sanders gave on the Senate floor regarding the extension of the Bush tax cuts in 2010. 


The book is less than $10 and **all authorial proceeds are donated to charity**. Consider it your good deed for the day AND you get an excellent book out of it. 


Also, I can't confirm this, but another user mentioned that putting the book in your cart will raise its rank on Amazon even if you don't buy it. 


Lastly, Bernie has another book called *[Outsider in the House](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1859841775/ref=pd_aw_sbs_14_4?refRID=12267PXWT3J0095Q5C2P)*, currently #924,515 on Amazon, although it appears to be out of print.  




 Umm...it actually looks like you can afford to donate 54k 

/s 




 Someone linked to it last night while it was in the 5,000s.  




 It's jumped over 3000 spots on the Amazon bestseller list since last night.  




 Someone should post [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I1-r1YgK9I amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player) of her speaking out AGAINST gay marriage. Either this one or a more recent one from 2008.  




 Honestly, I don't see a reason why GMOs should be labeled. Science has shown that they're safe.  




 I joined. I live in Auburn and would like to start/join a group for Placer County as well.  




 Sneaking down to the first row behind the basket with my mom...and then getting told to go back to our seats a quarter later. 




 2082 now. It has jumped 3000 spots in less than 24 hours. 


Edit: 1931 now!  




 How many people are expected to turn up tonight?  




 Awesome! What a great experience to share with your dad!  




 Didn't even know he had a book. I'll order it tomorrow at Barnes  amp; Noble. 


Edit: It's at 4440 now! 




 I took a lit class that focused on magical realism. We read *Beloved*, *Pobby and Dingan*, *As I Lay Dying* and *Of Love and Other Demons*.  




 That kind of defeatist attitude makes me mad. It's better to show up and fail than give up.  




 I've been looking for a succinct, but substantive, video to share on Facebook as well. I'll be keeping an eye on this post. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7L9V7oGRv8 amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player) is the best one I've found.  




 Check [this link](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/agenda/) out. It's taken straight from his website and lays out what he calls 12 Steps Forward. Let me know if I can clarify anything.  




 I was hoping there was a group already in place, but it doesn't look like it. I think I'll start one. I'm going to look into getting a banner printed this week and then do some tabling. I'm in Auburn btw.  




 What part of CA? I'm in the Sac area.  




 He's been very vocal lately in his opposition to the US leading the war against ISIS. He believes an Arab coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, should take them on.  




 I've never contributed to a politician before. I finally bit the bullet a couple weeks ago and donated to Bernie. Today, I made my second contribution...and bought a t-shirt.  




 I eventually would like to start a Bernie group, but I live in a small, conservative city, so I need to recruit some members first. I think I could gather some interest if I post up outside of a grocery store and try to get email addresses of potentially interested people. Is there a way to get the necessary supplies to do this? Really all I want to start with is a Bernie 2016 banner that I can put on the table so people know what I'm about.  




 Whitewater 




 I've never done it before, but a couple friends and I want to try it. Where's the best place to go? 




 I know it's early and we're still behind in the polls, but I think it's very reasonable to think Bernie has a great chance to win in Iowa and New Hampshire. He's only down 19 in Iowa with 7 months to go before the Iowa caucus. He still hasn't even had a debate with Hillary, which, when it does happen, will help Bernie in the polls.  




 You've already received some good answers, but I want to provide another perspective. Look at [this chart]( https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2delGcbK8FF7ck_fgtGWaA1iE5c=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3657424/bernie_hillary_donations.png) showing who the largest donors to Hillary and Bernie are throughout their careers. You'll notice that Hillary receives most of her money from large corporations like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs JPMorganchase, and Lehman Brothers. In fact, almost every donor on the list is a major corporation. Compare that list to the list of Bernie's donors, which are almost all worker's unions. 


Organizations donate to political campaigns as an investment. They think the rewards they get from having their candidate elected will be greater than their initial investment. Now I don't know your situation, but I would guess that you, as I and most Americans do, would benefit more from the success of laborers, engineers, teachers and machinists than you would from the success of Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. 


If you want to know who a politician will be loyal to, just look at who their major donors are.  




 But how does she feel about peas in her guacamole?  




 Here is a list of email addresses to most newspapers in Maine. Bernie will be speaking in Portland on July 6. Let these papers know that you want them to cover it.

Thanks to /u/s_all_Goodman for compiling the list.  




 Good idea trying to get it stickied. We have 55,000 subscribers here. If we can get just 10,000 of those people to use #Bernie2016 on Instagram or other social media outlets at 3:00 EST on Sunday it won't go unnoticed. Try messaging the mods about it. 

My advice is to only ask people to use one hashtag and to make it #Bernie2016. People will throw in other hashtags that they like, but #Bernie2016 is simple an it gets our message across.  




 I changed that part of it for Reddit. I signed my real name on the actual email.  




 Is this something you're planning on your own or is this a more widespread thing? We would probably be able to mobilize more Bernie supporters if we planned the same thing for a few days from now. How about Sunday, so it coincides with our plan to write letters to the editors of our local newspapers? 




 Exactly. I guarantee there are a lot of Hillary supporters who are loyal Democrats who simply feel like she is the only candidate with a serious chance of winning. As Bernie continues to rise in the polls, many of those people will jump ship and join Bernie.  




 One of the biggest problems we face is the lack of media coverage. Writing letters to the media will go a long way in resolving this, but it's also important that we thank those websites that do cover Bernie by giving them their clicks. At the end of the day, websites are trying to get views and they will notice if they get an abnormally high number of views every time they post a Bernie story. When this happens, we can expect to see more coverage. So, don't just read the headlines on the front page. Actually visit the website; comment if you have the time. Make it a smart business decision for websites to cover the campaign.  




 Below are the email addresses of most newspapers in Maine. Be sure to let them know how eager you are to read about the rally the day after. You only need to write one email and BCC to all of the papers.

 I would say 33% on July 2 puts us ahead of schedule. Most of us expect, reasonably I would say, to get another bump in the polls once the debates start. There's also the fact that Biden, who has shown no signs of running is at 7%. Who are those 7%? Could they be polling for Biden as an anti-Hillary protest. I suspect that those 7% could easily switch to Bernie supporters, assuming Biden doesn't jump into the race late.  




 Here's mine: short and sweet.


 Good afternoon,


Due to a prior commitment, I was unable to watch the live stream of Bernie Sanders' campaign rally in Madison last night. I figured I would still be able to read about it this morning in the NYT. Disappointinly, there wasn't a single mention of the event in today's paper. This is shocking because an estimated 10,000 people attended the rally, making it the largest campaign event for any candidate this election season. Senator Sanders is rising in the polls and is making the race for the Democratic Party nomination very interesting. In the future, please provide some form of coverage of rallies that draw crowds this large, for any candidate. It's a noteworthy achievement and a possible indicator of an exciting race this year.



Thank you,

 On one hand, I feel like Rondo only deserves a one year contract to prove himself. On the other hand, I feel like, even with Rondo, we're more than one year away from being contenders.

Well, he's right about that.  




 Woah, how did they know that the earthquake was going to happen???  




 I was in the same situation last week. I was told I would be offered the position on Monday, but I still had to interview last Thursday. Good luck!  




 But can you make it do [this]( http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1208411/kershaw.gif)? 




 Only if you can also throw the ball 90+ MPH exactly where you want it to go.  




 I doubt they will trade Belt, especially since Aoki is only signed through this year.  




 As far as I know, there is no active Sanders group in Placer County. I would like to be a part of one, but, since I work fulltime, I won't be able to devote the necessary time to the campaign. Is there anyone else in the area that would be interested in working with me to get a group going?  




 I saw the headline when I was on my work break this morning and began to sweat out of my eyes.  




 The closest major city is Sacramento, but I actually live about 40 minutes northeast in Placer County.  




 Similarly, is there a way to check to see if a Sanders group already exists in my area? 




 Machi looking DIRTY that inning!  




 Sweet! You met Curt Schilling.  




 For what purposes are they used? I'm a little concerned about my political activities getting back to my employer.  




 I haven't found a "real" job yet, although I haven't seriously looked. I'm still working the same retail job I started when I was 18. I was recently promoted to a lead position and I have an interview this week for a manager position. I don't want to make a long term career out of this job, but I figure it can't hurt to be able to put "manager" on future resumes. 


In the meantime, what can I do to make myself a desirable applicant in the future? The problem is I don't know what I want to do, so I can't tailor my skill set to my dream job. What are the skills I should teach myself or experience I should get if my goal is to land a 30k+ job within one year? 


I apologize if this question gets asked a lot, which I assume it does. I'm new to this subreddit and I really appreciate your help.  




 I want to do some volunteer work in my area, but I really have no idea where to start.  




 Wait. Let me get this straight. This picture was taken this morning and the game isn't until tonight at 5?
