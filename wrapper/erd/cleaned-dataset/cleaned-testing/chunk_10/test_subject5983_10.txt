 Yes they are. If I hadn't have seen the pair they'd be perfect. 




 Loved Animal Kingdom. Love anything with Ben Mendelssohn for that matter. 

I'll check out A Touch of Sin. Thanks. 




 Movies like Collateral, No Country for Old Men, Haywire, Bourne, even John Wick where there is tension and quiet broken by "professional" violence, where the action is mechanical and feels like something ordinary for the actor really get my attention.

Any suggestions for other intense, occasionally grisly, operatically violent thrillers? 




 what the fuck 









 Man Bites Dog 




 what's your favorite movie 




 what kinda pianos you got?

all your keys and synths sounds real nice. 




 Bravo, Judge!!! 




 Hell yeah Bruce Wayne skin. Wonder how they'll handle the cape. Maybe he'll just be unmasked Batman.  




 if you have to do New Game Plus to get all the way back there I'll be pretty peeved.

edit: i'm an idiot. just go through the elevator at Arkham Knight HQ South. 




 When was this? 




 That's him.  









 The American. More about a hitman than a spy, but still. Directed by Anton Corbijn, who did A Most Wanted Man. It's tense and beautiful. And it has George Clooney. 









 I wouldn't recommend Out of the Furnace, but The Drop is excellent. 




 but relatively speaking, I'm willing to bet it's still a similarly proportioned group, if not a bit larger in size. 

what made the psychedelic revolution a revolution was how new and exciting LSD was. it was polarizing.  




 I don't want any of your bullshit excuses. 




 Yeah, we're gonna need a yearbook photo. 




 it's one of those icee lids.  









 she's a successful fat woman in comedy

people are going to hate that 









 this some harmony korine type shit 




 MMW: Tomorrow, somewhere, a bear will shit in the woods. 

 




 Thanks man. Greatly appreciated. 




 Yeah I've started to learn it by ear on my own. It's so much more time-consuming but oh well

I need to learn this. I can't read sheets. 

I can learn it by ear, but a video would help tremendously.

If someone can learn it and upload a video of them playing the song showing their hands I will pay them like $10 or something via PayPal.

Thanks. 




 F is for Fake is essential. 

It will teach you how to edit.

EveryFrameAPainting has a great video essay on it. Check it out.

 get rid of wall
 




 Nice title, OP. 




 X-Men 2. The Nightcrawler fight is the best sequence in the whole movie.

Also, the new Bond movies, and most Tarantino movies. 




 Wow I didn't realize how much people didn't like that. I guess if you don't put "/s" after something blatantly not serious the hoard jumps on you. 




 They have a really polarizing sense of humor. My favorite is Burn After Reading, but really all their films are worthwhile and often darkly comedic. 




 Another great Caine quote on the matter:

"*Now I never saw Jaws 3, but I saw the house that Jaws 3 bought, and it is quite beautiful.*" 




 Soderbergh. His style works so well across genres.

Also, Spielberg and the Coen brothers.

The Coens may not seem it, but watch No Country for Old Men and then Raising Arizona or any of their funnier films back to back, and I bet you'd agree. 




 I'm Gazorpazor-fucking-field, bitch. 

Now give me my fucking enchiladas. 




 lol "the bomb"

because terrorists are often brown 




 I love the end of Burn After Reading, too. JK Simmon's nonchalant apathy is hilarious.

 Once you make this exist, please post the hell out of some pictures 




 Yeah, that did it. 




 "Not many people in California have basements" 




 Thanks 




 I'm finished. 




 The Funeral Monologue in Synechdoche, New York. 

Not necessarily a lie, but a pretty thoroughly multi-faceted scene that shouldn't just be taken at face value. 




 That seems like a pretty fuckin stupid idea

 Hey Steven, I imagine you're reading this, so just to let you know I haven't extensively looked into any of your theories and I don't necessarily believe that you are Christ, but you seem very confident, so just in case, what can I do to get off this FEMA Detention list? 




 A Single Man. 

It's only R because Colin Firth's character is gay. 

Everywhere else it's for most all audiences. 




 /r/asmr 









 The Bonds.

Quantum of Solace serves to help you appreciate the other two. 
Still has some nice fights and chases though. 




 That's like 10 hours though. 




 Just to be sure, won't all the pre-order bonuses be able to download eventually? 

I'll want to be sure I have access to all the characters/skins/challenges when all is said and done.

Edit: Apparently the answer is yes, but I'll go ahead and pre-order from Gamestop. Thanks guys.  




 yeezy's verse on Smuckers tho 




 Someone please save her videos. I feel like they won't be up forever and they're very good. 




 I want a Bruce skin. I love beating up people in plainclothes.  




 Riggan's words to the film critic and to his daughter in Birdman.

Really all of Glengarry Glen Ross, but especially Alec Baldwin's "motivational" speech. 




 They better keep playing Rainbow Six even if they dont get the views. These are the best videos they've had in ages. 

Who'da thought that when they actually enjoy their game we would too? 




 The black people watching were just as disgusted as I was. 
























 Where'd you watch it? 




 Out of all of the things that didn't happen, this one didn't happen the most. 




 Nightcrawler. 




 Gavin and the Communist Masseuse 




 yeezy just got me to look through some weird nudes in a public place 




 Trinidad gets royalty checks for Uptown Funk sales. 




 Emotional as hell. 




 Friends don't introduce friends to Burn Notice. 




 WE'RE BUDS!
