 Thanks man, and congrats! Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy mine :) 




 Pretty much, a bit of a homemade slaw and it's actually a cilantro aioli :) Toasted bun lightly brushed with melted butter also 




 Was pretty good thanks for asking, I've been eating super healthy the last month so my body was craving something like this lol 




 Birdie. 




 Nice, fellow Ontarian too :P 









 As a fellow Canadian also, thank you for the greeting. Hope you're having a great day :) 




 lol, it's fast enough for me...for now. I don't track or anything so I can't complain. 




 thanks man, yeah definitely not the car if you want something really fast lol 




 SubieFlow is a page that I'm a big fan of, didn't know I needed a turbo to sport one of their decals lol 




 The Crosstrek is a very cool ride. However, so is your '13 so be sure to enjoy it. Anyone who owns a Subaru is bound to have a blast regardless of the model! 




 Gives me +10 HP 




 lol thanks! 




 Thanks, much appreciated. I wouldn't mind a WRX or STi someday but this does the trick for the time being :)
