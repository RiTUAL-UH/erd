 So then I started dreaming that I was lucid dreaming because I was before I "woke" up even though since I woke up it broke it and I'm not actually lucid but just dreamt that I was.

Anyone ever had this happen before? 




 Maybe, maybe. I go back to Uni in a month and a bit. They aren't like bedbugs in that they infest and follow you fucking everywhere, or?
 




 Yeah? My room has had problems with mold. I don't really have anywhere else to put my books though. Nowhere that they wouldn't be "in the way". 




 I'm not really looking on ways to get rid of them because I'm lazy and am satisfied with just blowing/wiping them away at the start of each reading session. 

However, what is with them? They just appear. I read that they are common on old books, so why are they on my copy of The Casual Vacancy, that I bought back in February or some equally dismal month.

They do give me a bit of anxiety though, nothing major, but just the expectation of seeing them as I'm scanning each paragraph. I know they're not harmful to humans but I have a thing with bugs. My main issue is spiders. Just last week I was minding my own and  reading "The Five People You Meet In Heaven" by Mitch Albom in my bed and this spider struts up to me on my pillow, and I recoil. Good book though, sorta depressing but I enjoyed it.

So, yeah. What are your experiences with booklice or other insects? 









 why is lego so expensive :( 




 You're a whore. 




 shouldn't have to ask.

why is such an old lady in an airport anyway, what is she even up to, go back to bed and watch your fucking soaps

ARGHHH 




 No, no. /u/dillwillhill is correct. Minecraft is a bitch to get the mods working. 




 They're murderers. Fuck 'em. 




 He's not ACTUALLY going to murder anyone. Calm your many tits, fatboy. 




 To be fair, it's not like the shit on askreddit has copyright attached to it, and if someone wants to grab the ideas and make an entertaining video... whats the deal?

It's like flaming /u/Shitty_Watercolour for illustrating someone's comment. 




 Except, Mecca is a city with, as the OP said, a lot of historical value attached to it. People are going to be interested in it and these people aren't all going to be muslim.

Comparing it to the Queen of England's private residence is a bit of a leap. 




 mad 




 scarves are weird

 Hahaha! Where you from? It's a common variant where I live. 




 whatever, rube. 




 DAMIAN RISES! 














 No Barbara? *sigh*

Hope that idiot Blaine paid for that book he destroyed, also hope he doesn't ever drive again, because shit me, did he hit someone? 




 What a sly dog 




 Yeah, that's what I'm saying. The dick pics are harassment and absolutely uncalled for.

The rest I found funny.  




 This guy is awesome,  but I think he went a bit too far with sending unsolicited dick pics.

But the satire and making fun of SJWs had me cracking up;

"Did i trigger you"

"You're an obese tumblrina..." etc, that whole section was great.

and then the ending

"The patriarchy is watching ;)"

You played right into his hands and gave him what he wanted: a beautiful reaction. 




 NO MEG?! 




 NO MEG?! 




 Cool.

*waits for the next shitstorm* 




 You're not missing much, it's sticky and moist and gross and... and... *bursts into tears* 




 Nobody NEEEEEEEDS a haircut, you fascist.  




 Yeah, then you get viruses and have your account nicked :( 




 WHICH COMMENT DID I DOWNVOTE? DIDN'T DOWNVOTE /U/RANDOM-REFERENCE COMMENT AT LEAST, AND WHEN HIS COMMENT CAME THERE WERE NO OTHER COMMENTS TO DOWNVOTE SO BE MY GUEST AND TELL ME. I GUESS YOU BELONG IN THE BOX WHERE THE OTHER SHITSTORM STARTERS CAME FROM. SHOO. GO BACK IN YOUR BOX AND NEVER COME OUT. JUST IN CASE IT REQUIRES SAYING YOUR NAME BACKWARDS: AROODLAB

Yours sincerely, 
Ragnaros 




 You'd make a good headmaster at a private school
 




 People with more money than you can count. 




 Their work is playing video games...

 Are you bae? 




 Haha, okay. I won't spoil it. I've not been a fan of Claire since the very start though. 




 They are cute unless used in excess. 




 You are... just... awful... 




 Bet you are a Claire Underwood fan. 




 Sorry you're not attractive.
 




 Nasty! 




 Why? Free speech, white knight bitch. 




 *vomits* 




 Disgusting. 




 I thought that was Denmark 




 It's still not a male name :P 




 Shannon is NOT a man's name... 




 Are you being followed by a downvote brigade or something?  




  The pet may still be there, but it's dead to me

brutal 




 It's a hard thing to gauge, isn't it? I read a book on it. The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson, and there's some little test but even that isn't a good indicator IIRC. 




 ASMR? 




 *slowly raises hands like Walter White*

Ya' got me.

*grins*

But, nah. Do you think I am a psychopath?  




 Oh man, tamer than what I imagined. So, uh, what scenario lead you to finding out you were into this? 




 Hamid is a name, aye. Zwalisan, no idea, just pulled it out of my ass. And, woah, woah, woah! I'm not the psychopath here, I'm not the OP.  




 What does this ear fetish involve? 




 It's an affectionate term, Zwalisan. Calm down. 




 "Bae," Urban Dictionary says, is an acronym that stands for "before anyone else," " 




 Alright, Hamid. Can't be too careful now can I? 




 The women that you date. Are they bae?
