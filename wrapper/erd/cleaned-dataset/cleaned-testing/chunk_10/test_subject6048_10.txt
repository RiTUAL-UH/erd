 Wow, honestly that's the best one I've heard on this so far. Seeing a genuinely human side of someone you consider a hero/icon can be such an endearing experience.  




 Good to know, mucho gracious 




 Yup 




 The purpose of this was more to what 3 books would you want to shape a new civilization with.

You didn't ruin any fun, I should have phrased the question better. 




 Love the way this is illustrated, particularly the bottom half.

1992 is favorite for me. 




 Holy shit that sounds amazing, would have loved to be in that crowd. 




 I was originally going to say most profitable, but am honestly not sure considering MLB gets 160+ games of TV money and NBA 80+. Agree that per game isn't the best comparison but didn't want to spend the time researching the other stats. 




 I'm definitely with you on that last part. 




 The NFL makes the most per game profit margins over any other American sport and yet it's players are compensated the least. 


The NFL is easily the most injury-inducing, particularly of the career ending and mentally impairing variety , sport in America, yet its the only one that doesn't provide players with post-career health insurance. 




 For me, the most fun part about going to football games is the tailgate. I'm sure you could find a bus/bbq package or something you could get in on over the internet. 

You should definitely go to the game. NO is an awesome community and that should be a terrific matchup this year. 




 Strong to moderately strong 




 What are you talking about? The photos we have are magnificent. We've used IMAX cameras to film the Earth is literally the best we're capable of. 




 You'd probably like this book, http://www.amazon.com/The-Andromeda-Strain-Michael-Crichton/dp/006170315X 




 Someone wrote an article a couple years back about how absurd his numbers would be if he had more talented QBs throwing to him throughout his career. No offense meant to who the Panthers had pre-Cam, but he'd be a shoe-in HOFer by now for sure. 




 Todd Terje's "It's Album Time"

The Prodigy's "Fat of the Land"

I'll just put each album on shuffle, been doing it all year so far. 




 Probably the most valuable contribution ESPN has made to modern culture. 




 Ridiculous hypothetical, I know. And obviously books on engineering or medicine would be quite valuable but this would specifically be aimed at literary works. 




 I can only see technology improving safety by changing the style of helmets, something that would limit the movement of the head/neck areas. Something like this would probably limit each players range of motion, possibly resulting in less acrobatic plays. I don't see Defenses ever going back to the older style of hitting at this point, the trajectory the league is on is to make hits less violent, I don't see that trend changing, whether or not its better/worse for the game.

 




 Posting up on my couch for 10 hours straight every Sunday with a bag of Popeyes chicken and a 12-pack of Brooklyn Lager. 




 Might have some interesting feedback by posting this in r/physics or r/philosphy

They might actually sidestep it if they're slippery enough. 




 Great idea 




 Marshawn was truly born into the wrong era. God must know he effed up by not having him wreak havoc in Roman gladiator pits. 




 We STOMPED- YOU OUT!!! 




 Its pretty much become impossible not to like him. 




 Almost looks like I'm watching a movie when I see that, so surreal. 




 So close to being a brilliant play. 




 Easily my favorite book, I don't think there's any way the last two top it. So many storylines hit climactic moments in it. 




 ...Wow, I've been spelling it wrong for years. 




 That's a tremendous gif. Who is this? 




 Your probably waking up pretty dehydrated like most people, which is probably making your muscles pretty cramped. Combine this with having your body being completely stationary for the last 8 or so hours and you're gonna have a bumpy start. 

I'd say just keep getting up and doing it, your body will naturally make the adjustments and adapt. 




 Whether it be a moment during an interview, a play on the field, anything. 

 




 -Rickon is not dead, but given the attachment the reader has to him at this point he may as well not have been born.

-To your second point, like you said everyone believes Bran and Rickon to be dead. It would be a stretch for a bastard to claim the throne of Winterfell, but at this point he's the last remaining Stark.

-The reader is meant to be unsure about Clegane. Most would assume he's dead, but many are also hoping he somehow survived, we don't know at this point in the story.

Congrats on finishing the book, its a tome so don't feel bad that it took a long time.

EDIT: Spelling 




 Do they have storefronts that offer you cash at horrendous interest rates? Obviously its not a good option, but may be useful as a last resort. I see them pretty frequently in the U.S. 




 Thanks, definitely going to try this out. 




 Thanks, will be going digging in there this weekend for sure. 




 Nice, neat idea 




 I don't have it unfortunately. Are you aware of any inexpensive alternatives? 




 That definitely looks like the most well done technique. Not sure if I have the chops to pull it off but only one way to find out. 




 Thanks for the reply- I watched almost all of this guy's videos last night. Tremendous stuff. 




 ...I want this. Can you share how you made it? 




 In the particular shot I want:

1) Man reaches into pocket.

2) Text message screen on iphone is shown. Audience is meant to read content.

3) Man grimaces, shakes head, puts phone away.

As of now, I have a still screenshot of the text message sandwiched between the two action scenes. It looks pretty amateur, any suggestions? 




 Bout damn time! 




 I was starting to wonder if I'd run out of creative ways to lose my hard earned money, yet it seems an intriguing option has appeared... 




 Specifically one that's professional, so not someone filming on their phone. I know they usually show this of players at the beginning of game recaps, specifically on opening day or if they had a particularly good/bad day. And I'm sure there's clips of it in some of the recent America's Games. 

That being said, was hoping someone might know of the top of their head before I spend time digging through the possibilities.

Go Giants. 




 Why did you make such an utterly misleading title? He never once mentions his health, his age, or his possible death. 




 Would help to search things like "first project" within the sub and you'll probably find a lot of good suggestions. Would also just start googling "mini-bar project plans", things like that. 

There'll probably be a contingent of peeps telling you that this is too ambitious and that you should start with something simple like a box or table. Personally I think diving straight in to what you want to make can be an incredible learning experience, regardless of the obstacles and mistakes you'll make. 




 Tweezer Reprise 10/31/10 puts me in the ZONE. 




 Whether or not they deserve it, shouting at people isn't how you make/keep friends. Communicate your feelings to the person in a calm manner, if they aren't with your time than move on, but behaving childishly isn't going to make spending time with you inviting. 




 Gonna have some tough love here. It sounds like you're in difficult situation, but it also sounds like you've been making excuses for yourself for quite some time. 

No matter how bad the job might be, working regularly is a great source of pride and independence. You'll find just doing this for a small period of time will make your realize how capable you are and open up other avenues to you. Having an ambition to be a comic book writer/artist is awesome, and its something that can be pursued and developed in your free time. There's a lot of good resources out there on where to begin with something like that.

I'd suggest going on Craigslist and seeing what's available, start narrowing it down from there. 




 Robert Heinlein wrote a book based on this exact situation and its pretty incredible.

The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. http://www.amazon.com/The-Moon-Is-Harsh-Mistress/dp/0312863551

It's also a terrific audio book if you're into that. 




 Why would a partner be essential? I do them alone plenty as long as I'm not pushing a crazy amount of weight. 




 I'm in the same boat as you, haven't made a real effort to balance myself out until recently. Sounds like u/statuscrow is hitting the nail on the head though. 




 Looks great 




 You've got to unplug yourself. Walk around, explore, exercise is a terrific tool like some on here have mentioned. What you like to do will come to you, but it only comes with action. You have to focus on the external in order to grow internally. If you're constantly assessing and reflecting inwardly you'll stagnate your growth. 




 I bought a D3300 to start out with and have been learning a ton while messing around with it. That being said it cost me around $500, you could probably afford something more advanced. 




 You could try getting a small loan from LendingClub.com.

Depending on your area, if you religiously checked Craigslist every day you could find enough gigs that within a few weeks where you could accumulate the money. 




 Thanks for your reply. The US does have this, and I believe it is free if you fall under a certain income bracket. Is that what you personally though? My concern is that the government software or something like Turbo Tax is probably the least lucrative in earning the most back each year. 




 That is a fair point. To me, since there are substantial populations of fan bases that don't participate in social media or purchase merchandise, something like this is naturally going to be skewed.  




 This study is only using two metrics to account for "fandom", one of them being social media use. Its ridiculous to calculate something like this in the first place, but the method they used was just lazy. 




 Through your attorney, through an online tool like turbo tax, simply by yourself or something else? 




 Wow 




 Only company I could find was Sportech PLC which trades on the London exchange. Any competitors, specifically that trade on the NYSE that anyone is aware of?

EDIT:
To clarify I'm not referring to sites like DraftKings or Fanduel. Specifically software that operates things like Off Track Betting in bars, and could potentially expand when new legislation is past. 




 Talk about what you feel like talking about and ignore the inner monologue that keeps questioning whether what you're discussing is "interesting" or "compelling". Once you start naturally talking about things, even if it's just an instinctual undeveloped opinion, it will sounds interesting because you'll have even somewhat of a passion behind it. Short version: Don't think, just talk. 




 Your landlord cannot do that. Tell them you aren't leaving, there's a good chance they wouldn't want to go through the nightmare of taking it to court especially when you are in the right. 




 Do it. You don't need your Mom's permission, like literally you don't. Be your own person. 




 Looked up highlights to watch Jordy in action and the peeps in this thread are right.

Hope my Jints fans remember how beast Amani Toomer was at these. 




 Chocolate or Vanilla. They both taste delicious and mix well with things like peanut butter and fruit. If you're anti-sweeteners I can understand going for the unflavored, but when a protein powder actually tastes good you look forward to having it way more. 




 Amazon or Ebay are pretty effective. 




 Seems like the cops acted pretty reasonably as far as I'm concerned.
