 Audio sounds great and I'm really loving the vlog! Great job :D 




 Ahhhhhh I hope I win !! 




 I have to admit.. adding a slice of american cheese in korean ramen is pretty tasty.  There's even an Army Base Tofu Stew that has hot dogs and cheese.  Delicious! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euVyBKNfxkk 




 Yes!  "Let me setup Netflix for you" would be nice too lol. 




 Mine rises days before, and drops as soon as it starts. 




 They're both on :( 




 Damn you vacationers! lol.  I can't wait for September to show up.  Thank you so much, and congratulation on your 6th year in owning a retail business! 




 Hurry up September! lol 




 Yeah it seems like Summers are slow for everyone :(   




 My legs turned into jelly for a moment.... 




 Thank you so much for your tip!  I hope our sales trend will be like yours.  I can't even imagine what the Fall is going to be like... I'm excited! 




 Thank you so much!  




 Crossing my fingers!!  GO Reddit! 




 lol definitely not.  We did shows and festivals up till now, so I wasn't sure what it would be like to be in a regular retail environment :)   




 Phew, thank you so much for your reply.  Everyone keeps telling us that things start picking up in Fall, but nobody mentions summer lol.  Running a business is hard! lol 




 Hi everyone, we have a small bath and body products business in Los Angeles, and I've noticed that sales have been a bit slower this month.  Sales have been climbing for us every month since March, but suddenly I'm finding June to be really slow.  Is it just me lol? This is our first year in retail so I have no idea what types of sales trends are normal.  Thank you ahead of time! 




 Omg those are the best! 




 Hi everyone!  My husband and I finally were able to get a plot in our community garden (yayyyyy)!  We've never gardened before (outside of succulents grown in containers on our balcony), so we're unsure of what we should do next.  Currently there are things growing in our plot, but I really want to pull everything out, build some raised beds, and start growing some delicious vegetables.  

Here is an instagram photo of what's currently growing in our plot: https://instagram.com/p/1RT2cNkMgd

We are in Zone 10a :)

Thank you for your help!! 




 My call notifications are definitely on because I do get notified about 50% of the times for incoming calls.  You definitely were not being a smart ass lol.  That's a legitimate question lol. 




 I've never ever recieved 1 text message from my iPhone.  Just upgraded to an iPhone 6+ 2 weeks ago and it's the same :(. I've just accepted it. 




 Dear Zachary... :(

 Hi everyone! I have a large round pedestal table already and would like to make a few smaller cake stands to stack on top just like the pink ones in the picture. I figured I could purchase the round wooden plates pre-cut from Home Depot, but I can't seem to find the legs. I have seen a few thick candle holders, but nothing tall enough. Any help would be appreciated! Thank you DIY :)

 Wow 5 days without a charge?  That's really great.  I've definitely ended my workout so it's not the GPS.  It's comfortable and I really like wearing it.  Right now I'm just trying to figure out the notifications situation. 




 My husband purchased my surge from a target in Portland I believe.  He called around and couldn't find any near us in Southern California. 




 I agree.  It must be because I've kept my HR monitor on auto.  I use the GPS tracker 3-4x a week so I'm sure that doesn't help either.  I've just been so happy with my Force that suddenly having to charge so often has been kind of a bummer lol. 




 The notifications have still been a problem.  The GPS situation has definitely been fixed.  It's because I've been clicking quick start instead of having the GPS actually connect. 




 I just figured out my problem with the GPS. I've been clicking quick start to start my gps.  But now I stand on the street and wait until the GPS has been found and then go.  So far it seems like it's been working perfectly. 




 You're so right.  The charger does seem to click off the fitbit really easily.  I've been charging it until it says full on my app but maybe I should leave it connected a little longer? 




 I don't have GPS on all the time.  I have noticed that with my last battery charge, it's lasted about 3 days before I received an email from fitbit.   




 Hey guys! My husband bought me a Fitbit Surge for Christmas and I thought Id let you know my experience wearing it so far. 

Band: The band is thick on my wrist, but its quite comfortable.  The closure is like a regular watch so theres no need to worry about it undoing itself.  There is also a piece that slips over the extra watch flap and locks it down. This way you dont have to worry about all that extra watch band hanging over if your wrist is thin.  Ive been wearing it all day and only taking it off to shower. So far I havent experienced the gross smell that most watch bands usually give.

Clock face:  Its big and very easy to navigate.  The backlight is great, but I have found myself tapping it a few times at night for the light to come on.  The swiping is easy, but sometimes I find that its displaying other screens except for the time.  Im sure its because Ive touched it on accident or something.  Perhaps there is a way to lock the screen on clock?

Music control: Love running spotify on my phone and being able to control it with my watch.  

Text/Call notification:  I have yet to receive a single text on my watch.  I have however been notified 1 out of 10 incoming calls.  Ive reset it once so maybe I'll have to do it again. 

Heart rate: I havent tested the accuracy, but its been pretty fun to see what my heart rate is throughout the day and night.  I have noticed that on some nights my pulse is 10 points lower than on other nights.  Is that normal? 

GPS: The GPS is a little wacky.  Ive only used it 2x but both times the google map drawing was completely off.  Ill use it a few more times before I write to fitbit.  

*Battery: Charging seems to only take an hour, but man does this thing have a terrible battery life.  I charged it till it was full yesterday afternoon and it's already showing that it's 1/2 way through right now.  Is this happening to anyone else with the Surge?  I'm so sad because when I wore the Force it seemed it last forever! 

Thats it so far.  If you guys have any questions Id be more than happy to answer them :)

*edited to add the note on battery life 




 Crossing my fingers! :D 




 What an ungrateful biotch!  That just had to be said.   




 Thank you so much fraenk! I am getting visits from forum12343.darodar :(  They seem to be visiting 10-15x a day.  ehhhhhh 




 I just sent you a message :)  Thank you! 




 It's not coming from co.lumb.co.  It's going to co.lumb.co, but it shows that it's on my site.  So when I'm looking at my google analytics, Co.lumb is coming up as a page that people are landing on.  




 apparently it's on my blog... 




 Sorry for being so vague with the question lol.  I hope I can explain it better.... 

I always try to keep an eye on my google analytics, and the last couple of days I've been getting traffic that landed on Co.lumb.  When I click it, it takes me to http://co.lumb.co/ .  I'm just not sure why people are landing on my blog and it's appearing as Co.lumb.   




 Hi guys, I've been seeing traffic land on Co.lumb on my, blog but I don't know how that's happening.  Do you guys know what that's about or how this is happening?  Thank you! 




 Awwww... he's the big spoon :)

 Hi guys, the last 3 days my iphone 5 has suddenly been having problems with my home wifi.  I thought it was because I hadn't upgraded to the new iOS, but since I've upgraded it's still been the same.  Either I don't see my wifi, connect for a minute then it drops, or it's painfully slow.  I've tried to reset network settings, change my DNS to 8.8.8.8, turn off location settings, and a bunch of other online suggestions I've found.  I don't know why things have gotten so bad overnight while all the other devices in this house seems the same.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you :) 




 be my friend... lol 




 Tim Tams are so freaked addictinggggg!  We buy the " Arnott's " version from Cost Plus.  They are amazing when you take bites off opposite corners and suck up warm milk.  AHHH I need to go buy a bag tomorrow morning lol. 




 Awesome!  Thank you so much for letting me know :)
