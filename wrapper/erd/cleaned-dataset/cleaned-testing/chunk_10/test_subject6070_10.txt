 I feel like it is impossible to meet other bi women. Probably because I don't have bidar I can tell if someone is gay but bi women are tough to meet in the wild. 




 I actually have been working on this for the past few weeks for work. I will put it in a Google doc tomorrow and post it here. However I have only looked at 4 issues ; economy, immigration, health care, and foreign policy. But I have clips from all candidates speeches and chart to keep track of how you agree or disagree with a candidate. I teach government so that's why I did this. 




 The DSM v actually stipulates that the majority of suffers are of average or a bit over weight. I do think it is odd she is announcing it on the internet and she clearly has some attention seeking issues regardless.  




 Most people with bulimia are average weight. Because they typically eat so much food and even though they purge you can never get it all back up so they end up absorbing an average amount of calories. 




 Hahaha this made me laugh so hard where is this from? 




 If you haven't been there already there are plenty of like minded people over at r/vegan .  




 That is a really valid point, I think republicans would pick Jindal because they feel like he would balance out Jeb on a few things I thought Rubio might just be white noise . But I don't live in LA and I haven't looked at how the two of them are polling against each other. Rubio would be a good option . 




 This a thousand times I am editing videos of all the candidates for a website at work right now and every time I watch trump I cringe at how extreme he is. The far right loves him but moderates and independents won't touch him. I would bet Jeb will get the nomination and take Jindal as his running mate. 




 This was a thing when I was in highschool like 10 years ago. 




 I am doing a fellowship at a media station and I have to edit all the presidential candidates speeches , he is truly the worst candidate out there. He is so incredibly out of touch that the only thing that makes sense is that he's running to soften up the republicans so that moderates have a better chance. I just find it hard to believe that he is serious about all the crazy things be says. 




 I ride the metro in DC , if I am riding it home from work I just want to use that time to decompress. If I am riding it any other time I would be open to conversation and I do end up talking to tourist who are lost sometimes. But I think when you live in a big city you never really have your own space so there is kind of this understanding that you don't need to talk on the metro because it might be the closest thing you are to a lone all day. 




 Thanks good to know  




 I got rid of my Facebook when I started teaching high school for this reason . I didn't want to deal with friend request, or see something and feel obligated to say something ( like if a 16 year old was dating a 20 year old)  or have to delete all my pictures from when I was a bartender. 




 Congrats you look and I am sure feel fantastic! I have a logistics question for you , I would love to bike to work but I have to dress professionally, do you find you get too sweaty and have change clothes at work or could you bike in your work clothes? 




 I am on a mobile and don't have source but I will look a bit later , but the way it was explained to me was that cats are not a natural part of the food chain. So bird populations get killed in higher numbers that they naturally would. Causing the eco system to become unbalanced like higher bug populations and the like.  




 When I was younger I would let my cat out side, after she brought me 2 birds, and a lizard I decided that she could go on the screened in porch. Shortly after this I had a biology professor enlighten me about how  cats really fuck up the eco system. 




 Some things that really helped me were colored eyeliners instead of shadows, and rocking power brows. I put the colored liner on the outer third of my eye and blend it in towards the inner corners.  I had to come to terms with the fact that I can't really pull off some make up looks I love. So I focus on lips and brows and my skin . you have lovely eyes and there are a few make up artist on YouTube who could probably show you some tips and tricks, but that's what works for me. 




 I second fightmaster yoga my teacher is out of the country so I have been doing these videos at home.  




 I play and sing really slow and then speed it up if that makes sense. 




 I started playing a few months ago, and can already play a few songs . it is my first instrument and while it is challenging I am able to teach myself with the help of the internet and a couple books. I am not sure I could say the same for other instruments. I picked the ukulele because it seemed fun, I liked the sound ,and I liked the idea of traveling with it. I get what your saying that billing it as easy may discourage new players when it requires practice and patience like any other instrument, but people who do things just because they are easy typically don't make it too far in any endeavor. 




 Do you have a gym buddy that you can make times to meet up with. I find this is really helpful when I am lacking g structure. 




 Was a bartender before I was a teacher vodka soda with citrus is my go to diet cocktail. Avoid juice or mixers, as far as beer goes ultra has low calories and is pretty widely avalible 




 Hummus sandwich with veggies, plain yogurt with granola and fruit, canned soup with crackers, these are my go to easy lunches. I also will bring left overs from dinner the night before . 




 29/f/ high school social studies.

Goals this week , in order of difficulty 1 give up sweets, I have a horrible sweet tooth and I feel like since I am away from the snack machines I finally have a chance to stop. 2 give up alcohol, I don't drink a lot probably a few glasses of wine here or there but it is just empty calories so it has to go. 3 no more fast food I probably only eat this twice a month but with the extra time summer provides there is no excuse to consume this crap. 4 do something active everyday, so far this is going well in the past week I have been hiking, kayaking, swimming, walking, and done yoga I am already feeling better. It is so motivating to read everyone's goals!  




 That last description had me cracking up 




 Thanks I will give it a try!  




 I love the way the mountains smell in the summer. Hints of grass and floral notes, any suggestions would be great 




 I've tried the alternatives and they are tasty but just not the same. I kind of look at it like quitting smoking , even if I want it , it isn't good for me. Will power is an important part of being vegan 




 I am really happy for you that is amazing. I have been vegan for a couple years and still have cravings for non vegan foods not meat or eggs but I really miss cheese pizza and icecream. The knowledge that what I am doing is the right thing makes it easier and the cravings have definitely gotten better with time. I hope one day it becomes effortless for me. I think it is fantastic and gives me hope :) . 




 Thanks so much for responding I feel like that would be a great situation to have a threesome. I have a friend who might be interested now that I am thinking about it and I would feel comfortable with. Glad it was so positive for you!  




 That's great ! My SO and I have been talking about this but I am worried I'll get jealous. How did you handle those feelings? 




 Unless you want a cocktail . you get no more booze even if you say no ice so now you just have a hot rum and coke that is mostly coke.  




 As a high school teacher I have so much respect for elementary school teachers. I can't imagine trying to deal with 30 kindergarten kids by my self . the end of the year is a hot mess at most schools, sorry you had a tough time . 




 Hey I have been playing for a few months. and the past couple weeks I have been focusing on my bar chords and while some of them have gotten better many of them still sound muted. I am specifically having trouble applying equal pressure to the bar finger and the non bar fingers so I can only get one or the other to sound right. Also i feel like maybe my hand isnt flexible enough for some chords. Not sure if there are any tips for this or if it is just a keep practicing thing. Any help would be great. 




 Totally understand that life style and how hard it can be to get to know people if you don't really go out or want to get fucked up all the time. You may try contacting misc and seeing if they have any research positions open. I would also encourage you to talk to your advisor at school and see what ideas they might have professors tend to have a pretty good network of people to reach out to. Who knows you maybe able to get a job on campus that would get you out of the kitchen.
