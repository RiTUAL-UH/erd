 Thank you. I kind of agree, but I thought that made it look cool! 




 I thought it looked good :( maybe it's the lighting? Tasted great though!  









 He's ok. Not much better than his regular card. It's cool to have on your team though, especially since no one seems to be buying him. 




 They've been easy since 13, nearly impossible to miss this game and they weren't bad on 12 for me 




 Play against  the computer. Start at whatever difficulty you want. If you're comfortable that's good. If it gets to the point where you aren't losing and are easily winning, go up a difficulty. If you just getting into soccer watching more and more of it can help you play fifa.
 I have a friend, he started playing it on fifa 13 and I would beat him 7-0, he now beats me most of the time, although he plays much more than I do.
Watching youtubers can help too. It may sound ridiculous or nerdy, but studying how others play can make you better.
Here are my tips: 
1. Be patient with the ball.
2. Be patient, but not too patient on defense.
3. Get comfortable with a few skill moves. 
4. Learn what's OP in the game, abuse it and learn how to stop it. 
5. Develop a style of play you're comfortable with. 
6. Be deadly with set pieces. (Free kicks have been OP for years now, and corners can get easy.)
7. Know the players you're using. (This might be the most important aspect. You don't want to try long shots with a guy who's long shot is 62. You don't want to head a ball in with a guy who has 50 heading accuracy. You should know weak and strong foot as well as skill moves for the players.)




 




 Games like this make me wanna break my game, and that's why I don't have a physical copy.  




 Sorry I'm at work and was bored on the toilet 




 Gervinho-Doumbia-Ibarbo for a cheap front 3. Although Cuadrado is solid too if you prefer him to Ibarbo.

But really, I've loved the NIF Griezmann. He's great, I have him in a team with NIF Pogba and Benzema linked up with him and Griezmann has been brilliant. I also use him as a super sub in my other squads. 

Reus is simply amazing and fairly cheap. 

I like NIF Bolasie is you know skill moves fairly well.

Enner Valencia is an amazing striker, and he is almost always in perfect position. He's poached plenty of goals for me. He's not rated highly and he's cheap. 2 star skills though, but unless you're a skiller that shouldn't matter. 

Wayne Rooney if you love long shots and strong strikers.

I've got a team with Doumbia and Teves, I think they compliment each other really well and Teves is a beast - very similar to Rooney I think. 

A brilliant CM for La Liga is Perez, I forget what team he is on. Great attributes across the card. 

I think the best CDM in the game is Khedira. Obviously he's slow, but he's been rock solid for me all year. 

For fullbacks, I've liked Evra, Luke Shaw, Kyle Walker the most. David Alaba is or was over 10k and I found him underwhelming. 

For center backs I like Benatia the most, although his high attacking work rate can be kind of annoying. I really like Rojo too.

My favorite goalkeeper in the game has been De Gea. No keeper has impressed me as much as he has or has saved me as many times. 

Also, Lewandowski has been one of my favorite strikers to play up front. Great long shots, positioning, solid speed and he's strong. 

Edit: Chicarito has been very fun to use as well.

 How do I donate?

Edit: nevermind I guess it will be in a new theead 




 This is what I want to do like 80% of the downtime I have with my girlfriend at night, but all she wants to do is have sex... 




 So close to being heaven in a picture  




 Good luck, but I hope I win! RemindMe! 2 Days "donate $1" 




 I pinch my wrist a lot and it goes away in about 30 seconds  




 Some people are sick and need professional help.  




 I agree. Ozil's skills aren't something that show up on a stat sheet or are glaringly obvious when watching highlights. But watching an entire Arsenal game, you see where and how Ozil shines.  




 Their strategy is always send a through ball to Neymar, run straight with Neymar and miss.  














 I always would've loved to see him on the squad, but we are simply too stacked at his positions.  




 Because he is clearly holding his own on that team and can hold his starting spot... 




 Public Health  




 Well, here's another article I'm gonna see because I want to go to NYU.  




 Wasn't LVG thinking about playing Januzaj in a more central attacking role, or was that a baseless rumor?  




 I'm so happy. He was my favorite player outside of Man U and now he's joining the club. I cannot wait to put a Man U Schweinsteiger jersey next to my Germany ones of his. Now if we can only get Reus and Boateng...

 Thank you! My friends just organized a big tournament and I'm the 4th seed out of 8, but my first round opponent is a big pace whore and I struggle against him, but I whoop everyone below him and compete with everyone ahead of me. Thanks! 




 So I consider myself a solid fifa player. I'm d2 in seasons and d4 in ultimate team, but the one thing I struggle with the most is when players can just sprint right by my defense. I can't seem to stop that. I've tried being more patient on defense and playing less pressure but I can't get it to work. Any tips are appreciated! Thank you 




 Ogtrilldanb 




 Wow, thank you for your answer. 
It's incredibly disturbing and sobering to remember that these things happened. Again, thanks for your answer. 









 Either way, I wouldn't mind having either come off the bench or as a second option!  




 - absolutely no weak foot
- loves missing long shots
- tires after one run
- decent pace for that one run

 




 And Man U is still larger globally... 




 Ramos doesn't give a shit about who his fans are he cares if he gets paid and if he has a chance to win a title. Let's be real. And I'm not saying whether fans from India or anywhere in Asia are more valuable than the ones in Europe or the ones that speak Spanish, I was simply saying worldwide Man U has a larger fan base.  




 Back in the winter transfer window I saw one. 




 He's not talking in terms of trophies, but in terms of popularity. Globally Man U may be more well known than Real Madrid.

 It's a good show. I came in skeptical because it's on syfy, but it's good.  









 What a universal talent 




 If you're gonna play it a lot then go for it. If you have friends who play the game then go for it. I just got it a week ago for $24 and it's been a good idea. All of my friends play it and I've had time to play it. 




 I'm new to ultimate team and I'm working on a Bundesliga team. I'm having difficulty filling out the open positions and I don't want to have to spend too much on them. Right now I have Messi on for 3 more games at striker. I have Bas dost in my squad, but is he any good?
