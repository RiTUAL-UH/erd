 Sorry if the title is slightly confusing. I'm not great with words.

I saw Ant Man and while I did think it was a good movie, I couldn't help but constantly think about what could've been if Edgar Wright was still the director.

I felt the same way watching the Steve Jobs biopic trailer. At some point David Fincher was suppose to direct with Christian Bale starring. I thought it was a perfect combination. I couldn't help but think what could've been while watching the trailer. Though I love Fassbender and Danny Boyle so I'm still holding on to hope.

Are there other films you can think of where someone was originally involved with a project from the beginning, but left early on, leaving it for someone else to continue? Did it ruin it for you because you were you thinking about what could've been? Do you wish that person had stayed or are you happy they left? Do you think it was for the better or worse?

 See I don't know why people are championing for Idris Elba so hard when it will absolutely never happen. He's already 42 years old.  




 So why is everyone against this? He has the look. He has the acting ability  




 So with Daniel Craig being nearly done with the role, it'll be almost time for a new actor as Bond. Obviously we don't know what era of Bond they go with, but if they went for a younger Bond, I think Matthew Lewis would be absolutely perfect for the role. Just an idea I wanted to get out there. I would link to some photos but I'm on mobile.  




 She turned olive drab into totally fab! 




 Oh snap you're right. Totally forgot about that one! 




 Paul Thomas Anderson doing horror. His films are already super tense. Imagine if he was actually trying to strike fear in your heart. 

Terrence Malick doing action or crime. 

David Fincher doing horror as well. 

Christopher Nolan doing a war movie. His scale and scope would fit this. WWII, Vietnam, Iraq, future war, etc. Any setting would work. 

Again, Terrence Malick, but doing a super hero movie. His God/Nature vs man, good vs evil themes would work well in this setting.  




 Reverse psychology. Op secretly wants to be upvoted.  




 Good luck to everyone.  




 Wow. Just wow. You have a horrible attitude that is absolutely toxic for any creative environment. 

So no one in the film business should be there if they have a love or passion for it? You don't have a love or passion for it? You're just there for the paycheck?

If you ask me, based on what I've heard, you're the one who's there for the wrong reasons. Not them. 

Why even be in film if you don't have a love or passion for it? 




 I admire you for doing what you did, but What about people like me who cannot afford to move to a film hub? We just don't deserve to do film? You're basically saying people who are unable are undeserving. You're telling people to not even bother trying. 

It may not be my career but it's my passion so screw you or anyone else that has the audacity to say I don't deserve to do it because of where I live. 

Film isn't just a career, dude. It's an art and anyone anywhere can do art.  




 I'm 21 years old. I work hard for little pay. Barely enough to support myself. I love making films. I live in a city where the film community is very very small. I simply cannot afford to live in a city where there is a budding film community.

I don't think it's right to judge someones love and dedication to film because of where they live. That's just ignorant. Some people simply can't afford to just pack up their lives and move to a new city. 




 I'm a big film guy. Done a few shorts. I'd love to help out 




 Yes 




 Nope. I'm adding an edit in the post to be more descriptive. But the environment the people were in was normal. 




 I believe it was foreign? Everyone was humping things throughout the video. 

Edit: The environment the people were in was normal. 




 Samsara. Basically shows a bunch of different cultures with zero dialogue so no language barrier.  




 Some of these really aren't bad. Especially for their time. Sure, when you compare them to today, of course they'll look bad.  




 I see mad max fury road in that word cloud.  









 So I don't read comics so the tone might be right, but I was under the impression that Suicide Squad was going to be a fun, dark comedy action movie. Sort of like a Bad Boys or Hot Fuzz. This trailer made it appear way more serious than I was expecting. Not that I'm complaining, just unexpected. Looks great! 




 No one has said it, but Honeymoon. Watch it. It's on Netflix. It's like 80 minutes. And it's *pure* atmosphere. Really creepy. Very mysterious. I found myself saying, "what is going on?" constantly, in a good way. I've found that the ending is what divides most people, but it's still worth a watch. Very solid, atmospheric horror. Watch it.  




 It reminded me a lot of Limitless in some ways even though their stories aren't that similar. I can't tell you why I kept thinking of limitless, but I did for some reason.

The biggest disappointment for me was the visuals. I'm a huge fan of Tarsem Singh because even if his movies aren't great, like Immortals, at least they are gorgeous. I realize that Self/Less isn't a visual masterpiece because it's setting doesn't lend itself to that being a for the most part realistic modern setting. 

It doesn't take place in a fantasy world, or dreams, or ancient Greece. It's modern America. But that's why I see Singh films, so I was disappointed.

The film frustrated me because there are plenty glimpses of brilliance in there that they don't really do much with. This film had the potential to be a great, original sci fi flick, but everytime it starts getting interesting it turns back into a generic thriller.

The acting was unfortunately the best part for me. And I say unfortunately because I wish everything else was better. Everyone does a pretty great job in their roles though. Even the little girl I thought was fine.

My main gripe though is that it easily could've been a great film. So much wasted potential. They managed to turn a pretty great, original sci-fi idea into a generic movie, and that's the worst thing about it for me. 




 I also thought it was weird that Ryan was so appalled to learn that the dude donated his body to save his daughter. Like, it makes sense and is a great sacrifice.

I think it's funny that the entire film wouldn't have happened if he did what Goode said and just didn't poke around.

Also, I kind of ended up agreeing with Goode's character, Albright. He was kind of right in that most medical breakthroughs had sacrifices. Reynolds was just being a nosy ungrateful dude.   




 I got really excited about a short film idea and stayed up all night writing. Wrote a 17 page first draft in about 7 hours. 




 My two entries. I'm really looking forward to getting feedback being a new writer, as well as reading other people's entries.

 As someone who knows quite a few girls who are into horses, you are right.  




 These are easily the two best blurays out there. 




 The Matrix. Blew me away. It didn't just make me see film as an art, but it also made me want to be a filmmaker so now I make stuff and it's all because of that movie. 




 This is some top notch editing 




 Where the heck did you find a True Detective steel  




 Drive 




 Punch Drunk Love? 




 You're right, I completely forgot about Guardians of the Galaxy. And I haven't seen Winter Soldier but I hear it's great. When I say style, I mean more in how it's directed and shot, not what style of film it is. I do agree with you that they feel different, but they don't look particularly different except for GotG. I think that's because as time has gone on, Marvel studios has turned more into a factory. Directors have less and less say because of the vision Marvel has for its universe. 

Aside from GotG, I think most of them are visually bland and uninteresting. I get that they have to look like they are connected but still, I can't help but not care about what I'm looking at when I see a Marvel movie now. But that's just me being a "visuals" snob. I think that's why personally I'm more excited about BvS. When Zack Snyder and Larry Fong get together, it's always interesting. Now whether it'll be a good film or not is very 50/50, but boy will it be pretty. 

I just want it to be clear that I'm not faulting anyone who likes and enjoys Marvel movies. They are well made films. 

Edit: It's just, like, my opinion, man.  




 They did something unique then proceeded to do it over and over and over and over again. Marvel, while technically good, has gone stale for me. Ant Man was the first Marvel film I was actually excited for since the first Avengers. Then Edgar Wright left and took his style with him. Obviously I haven't seen Ant Man yet, but I'm expecting another Marvel cookie cutter film.

People can argue all they want about how good or bad Batman vs Superman looks, but one thing's for sure, it oozes style. Something that has been lacking in Marvel movies lately for me. 




 I still say quotes from the thief to this day 




 I really hate this post. It's entirely pointless and pandering. You very well know this is a well loved movie here. And if you didn't, then you should've used the search function because it would've yielded many posts talking about the movie in a positive way. 

This post serves one purpose: to pander. I wish the mods were better about removing post that clearly pander.  




 But supposedly Ving cut himself shaving and showed up with a band aid and Tarantino told him to leave it on because he liked it.  




 What do you mean by flat profile? 




 I don't really know anything about cinematography, is this suppose to help us determine the suns position so we can account for it? How does this tool help me? What do I use it for?

I'm not trying to sound ungrateful or smart, I just genuinely don't know. Thanks!   




 Some friends and I are wanting to make a short film. Our budget is very small and the short takes place entirely outdoors. What are some tips from yourself, articles, or videos that will guide us, and help us shoot some good looking footage outside on a shoestring budget?  




 Not with that grammar.

 Rob Schneider as older, bald Max Payne from Max Payne 3. Seriously. I think he has the capacity to be a great actor given a role that lets him act serious.  




 The heat index for my city will be in the high 90's-low 100's. I'm in need of some shorts, but haven't had any real luck finding some good ones.

What are some brands that are good, and which should I stay away from?

Are certain styles better than others? I know it's mostly preference, but what should I be looking for? What shorts, in your experience, have worked well for you? 




 Not according to The Matrix 




 I'd love to see more posts like this on r/movies. Bringing unknown, great movies to light and exposing them to new people. 




 I know he's fallen off lately, but back when Just Cause 2 came out, I thought it'd be a perfect film for Robert Rodriguez.  




 I agree. I'm not even sure Spec Ops is filmable. 




 But *so* much of RDR is influenced by, and references, other western films in terms of it's setting, style, story and characters that I'm not sure how well it'd work. 




 It won't be two hours. In today's day and age, TLOU would for sure get two more sequels. So, in theory, with 3 movies it could work, but the game was around 20 hours so it'd *still* feel rushed. 




 I don't think it was so much he already had his mind made up as much as it was him just acknowledging that it wasn't a movie geared towards him and his taste. And while I do think it's important to review a movie based on what it is and not what you want it to be, I do think there is something to be said for reviewing a movie based off of who you are. Makes it a little easier to judge if you'd like a movie or not. For example, if I find I agree and generally have the same views as a certain reviewer, then it helps me determine if I'd like a movie or not.

It should also be said that Filmdrunk is a personality driven site by comedians. They aren't interested in objectively talking about movies. They enjoy speaking subjectively about them. They know they aren't, and never claim, to be the best, or most informative reviewers. 

Yes they can be very cynical, but that's just their personalities. And it should be said that they all have very different personalities and opinions. This is just one dude.  




 And it's not just visually beautiful, it's also thematically beautiful.  




 I'm a nice guy 




 And that's it. I can't remember the name but I'd like to find it 




 Is none going to talk about how hilariously ridiculous Vincent D'Onofrio's plan for a raptor army was? Still a way better movie than I was expecting though.  




 In my experience, I kind of have to. I don't know and can't afford an editor *and* a cinematographer *and* a director *and* a writer etc. 

Sometimes you just have to do it all yourself. It's more stressful and harder, but you do what you gotta do. It's worked out alright for me in the past. 

When your just starting out, unless you have a lot of money, people, professionals, usually won't work for free. Now if you have previous work that is good, some might because it shows potential. But a lot of the times, at least for me, the only way to start a portfolio is to do some shorts where you're doing everything. 

However, it also depends on the scope of the project as well as your budget.  




 Willravel 2015 




 I remember when Gravity first came out and anyone who said anything negative about it was downvoted because everyone thought it was the second coming or something. 




 I'm with you. What happened in Up is just life. It's natural. Now if she died young that'd be terrible, but it seems like besides the failed pregnancy, they lived a rather happy life. They were able to grow old together. 

Now Interstellar, he couldn't be there. The realization that twenty something years had just gone by was soul shattering. Him watching his kids grow old without him, knowing he missed it all. That's not natural. That's hell for a parent.  









 Blood is pretty dark irl though.

As someone who has studied forensics in school, it is not. When you have a lot of blood condensed in a small area, it's dark. But blood, like you would get from a spray from a gunshot is very red. Even pooled blood is red. The deeper the blood, the darker it gets obviously, but blood from a typical gunshot or stab wound is red. The blood isn't thick/deep enough for it to appear dark.

But it doesn't take any sort of specialist to know this. Look at any pictures of crime scenes or surgeries and you'll see. Fresh blood is red. 




 I think short term 12 is a really good well made film. But the thing is, it's nothing groundbreaking. It's just a really good drama. I honestly don't understand why it gets so highly praised. 




 So I think this movie was very good, however I think I ruined it for myself. I was going into it with the expectation of crying my eyes out and having this huge emotional ride. I never got to that point. I kind of felt this movie just fizzled out. The climax wasn't that high for me. I dunno. Like I said, this movie is still very very good and the acting is great. 




 I really really love romance movies like The Proposal. Movies where someone asks someone else to pretend to be their spouse or significant other in order to fool some person(s). However, in the process of pretending, they, of course, actually do fall in love. 

Are there more movies like this? I'm sure there has to be, right? 




 Legend's wife seems *super* drunk 




 The writing wasn't terrible, the acting was good, the cinematography was good, and the directing was fine. In fact, it's no secret that a lot was cut for theatrical release. 

It's an average film, and if it wasn't a remake, people would be okay with it. I've seen both. I strongly believe that if people have the ability to see both, they should choose the original. Just like everyone else. However, if you only had the option to see the Lee one, for whatever reason, it's not bad. 

It's subpar to the original, but for the most part tells the same story without much change. That's why it's not a bad remake. Just unnecessary. As a film though, from a technical standpoint, it's not bad.  




 No it's not. Is it unnecessary? Yes. Is it bad? Not at all.  




 So my day started at, like, 3 am? I went to bed early then woke up waaay earlier than I wanted to. Oh well, took advantage of the time and finished up Bloodline! That show's pretty great. Got very suspenseful towards the end. Finale left me with mixed feelings. Still, great overall.

Had breakfast at around, I dunno, 6 maybe? More eggwhites. This time with spinach and chicken. Get dat protein. Then a tangerine. Started working on my film resume. Took a nap then went to work.

Work suuuuuuccckkks. Super slow. Strange customers. Ugh, I hate people. Waling around. Moving things. Not buying stuff. This lady was there walking around till after close and I'm just like "gtfo"

Had chicken and veggies for dinner. Should've seasoned the veggies...

Watched Wayward Pines. I have no idea what's going on in this show.

My mom and sister's birthday is tomorrow. They have the same birthday. *Still* haven't gotten a card. I'm a bad brother/son!

Think I might clean tomorrow. *Maybe*.

Really hyped about Mad Max this weekend! I'm seeing it with Zach and Kevin, my besties. It's gonna be sick!

Maybe I'll watch movies all day tomorrow. 




 Finally finished my film resume. Put that off waaaay too long. Now I just have to send it in and cross my fingers.

Man, if I get this job I can finally say I do film for a living. How cool is that? Goodbye retail, hello film production!

Knock on wood! 




 I've never applied for a position in film before. I finished my resume and demo reel. The company asked for them to be sent together. They gave an email to send it to, but no other info.

Do I send the resume as a PDF? On google drive? Dropbox?

Do I just include the link for the reel?

I realize this might vary from company to company, but since they gave no info, is there a standard way to do it? 




 So I guess this is the first "official" diary entry.

I'm assuming someone came in and downvoted everyone. Not just me, but the commenters. Not the environment I want to have, so I did something to prevent it in the future.

No more downvote arrow! Welcome to 1942 France!

No, but seriously it's not a diva thing of "how dare someone downvote me!" No, it's more about creating a non hostile environment. 

I started my diet and exercise this morning officially. Just a two week diet though. My cousin is getting married in two weeks and I wanna look decent in a suit. 

Diet is working so far. Had eggwhites this morning. I've been snacking on oranges and occasionally, tuna, throughout the day. I also went on a 3 mile walk. Already lost 2 pounds! It's nice to see results so soon.

Then I took a looooong nap. Felt great!

I wanted to get back down to 200lbs by August. I was 200lbs my senior year of high school, my peak physical fitness. Got 30lbs to go. Seems doable by August. I'm still kicking myself for not joining that gym back in January like I said I would. I am an artist and procrastination is my medium.

Other than that, not much has happened today.

Been talking to this girl. Real nice! We'll see how far this goes.

It's 9:48pm at the time of me writing this. Chicago PD is on in the background. That dudes voice is hilarious! I might spend the rest of my night watching the rest of Bloodline. I'm halfway through and I wanna finish before I forget what happens.

I dunno. Might play some Call of Duty? Oh yeah, I'm having PS4 problems. Forgot. Oh well. Maybe I'll play Rock Band 3?

Whatever, I'll figure something out.

 lol 




 So in the mean time while I figure out whether to let people post in this sub and what those posts should be, as well as the general nature of this sub, I thought it'd be a *hopefully* good idea to have a place where people could ask questions and make comments. Maybe you have an idea on how to make this strange subreddit work or maybe you just want to ask whatever. Either way, feel free to post it here.

 




 I'm trying to figure out the best way to run this place. You know, a way where things are organized.

Thinking about how to title stuff. Should I include a date in the title? I feel like that'd be redundant considering reddit will quasi-date things for me. Maybe I should just number stuff, like "Entry 1", "Entry 2" and so on.

Maybe I'll just abandon all attempts of organization and just post things how they happen.

What if I categorize the posts? That might work. Such as "Diary Entry", "Picture", etc. But then that means I have to come up with headings, which also means I need to put some forethought into this. *Maybe*.

Who knows? Eventually things will just organize themselves, right? That's how I made it through high school.

ATZ 




 This place is a diary of sorts. I'm test_subject6208, and though my life isn't interesting enough to warrant my own subreddit, I'm still doing it.

Why? I figured it'd be an outlet to talk about things anonymously, for the most part, while improving my writing skills at the same time.

I thought instead of just creating a massive post about who I am, I would just let things reveal themselves over time. Who I am as a person, my hobbies, likes, dislikes, my life, etc., will be revealed over time. I'll post "diary" entries that will be in the form of a text post, picture, or both. These entries will be about my days, thoughts, or whatever.

I've never been good at keeping a journal. Hopefully I'll be diligent with this. If Reddit stays around for a while, it might be an interesting, yet unconventional biography of sorts for whoever takes an interest in it.

ATZ

Edit: It should be said that my style of writing is more like free writing, but less organized. Entries will most likely be written as I say it in my head with little thought of what makes sense, if that makes sense?

Note: I tend to be sarcastic and hyperbolic when I write. I'm trying to lessen it, but it's a habit. Can you have writing habits? Either way, just keep it in mind.  









 Man that part when they're in the kitchen and she's just like "I don't love you anymore" and Gosling just starts crying. That ending is so rough. Beautiful film.  




 I'm an aspiring filmmaker, and it'd be awesome to mess around with it and make short films. 

I asked Rockstar but never got an answer.

Would director mode even work on consoles? 




 It's okay. *I* got your reference.  




 Yep, I think Pattinson stole the show in this one 




 So could they not just chop off the Silent Hills trailer at the end and re release it? 




 Going to a wedding in a few weeks. What are some good, trendy places around here that aren't very expensive? 




 Interesting, I actually find Cinema Sins more clever than Honest Trailers.

I also find it interesting that Red Letter Media gets so much love in /r/movies. They are very cynical about movies and are often harsh and, at least on Half in the Bag(their review show), appear to not really keep up with movies and not care about most modern big budget movies, which /r/movies loves. I love RLM though. 




 To make a long story short, I'm an aspiring filmmaker. Been working for years shooting various things. Never for profit. Finally, my work paid off. Met with someone that wrote a book that was being made into a film. Nothing big, they had a small budget. I was asked to help write then later, asked to direct. Things were coming together, we were just about to start writing. I then get news that they decided to hire professional writers and get a different director. I'm probably not involved anymore.

I'm not giving up filmmaking, but this was such a blow to the gut. Would love to eat this pain away.

 Wow, I had no idea and have not seen it before so I will definitely check it out, thank you! 




 Wow, that's a lot of candles, but it looks great, thank you! 




 Most definitely 




 Stoic isn't *that* bad 




 After looking through screenshots of various films it made me curious of the lighting set up of those scenes such as what were they using and where were they placed. Any places online that go into this? 




 I'm trying to find examples of films that were shot exclusively using practical lighting. However, google isn't yielding results. Do you know of any that were entirely or almost entirely practical lighting? 




 I'm co-adapting a book into a screenplay. The book, however is primarily narration with vey little dialogue. I'm struggling with coming up with ways of telling this story without it lacking any dialogue. 

The book features many characters interacting, but rarely with any dialogue. They *do* talk, but in the book, there's no dialogue for the conversation the characters are having.

The author expressed interest in the film being primarily narration, but I'm not sure how to do this without it being tedious, boring, or overdone.

Not really sure what to do. Any advice or examples of films that pull this off would be very helpful. Thank you guys in advance.

 Saw the title and misread it as a movie called Seven Soviet and thought it was a Russian retelling of Seven Samurai.  




 Ride with me.  




 Only took me, like, 15 minutes  




 This can be caused by the marketing, word of mouth, etc

I'm not necessarily saying they were intentionally misleading, but more so they appeared to be one kind of movie, but after seeing, turns out to be something else. 

My example is the film Martyrs. It's marketed as a horror and while it technically is horror, after seeing it it feels more like an emotional drama

Also The Babadook. For those who haven't seen it, it appears to be a horror film but after viewing, feels like a psychological family drama. 

Are there other films like this that aren't as they appear on surface level 




 The Wrestler 




 Yeah the same thing happens to me. Also, I followed an npc on foot and he just walked around the block continuously. 




 Absolutely watch New World! 




 To me it's because the tattoos make it look like he's *trying* to look crazy and unstable, whereas without them he just seems naturally crazy and unstable. 




 I have a somewhat general question. love editing, especially trailers. How does one get into it professionally?

 Was it really only 3 years? Feels way longer 




 Or just have it be the after credits scene.  




 I know this isn't the type of thing that you would normally turn into a post, and I wouldn't be surprised if only a few people saw it, but I had to get it out because it's too perfect. 

What if Showgirls wasn't made when it was and instead was made today. And what if it wasn't directed by Paul Verhoven(?)? Who would be the best director for the Showgirls of the 2010s? 

Nicholas Winding Refn. 

I know Refn is a name that sometimes gets jerked around here, but bear with me. The story I think would fit his style. This strange crime-esque story with not so normal characters. Not to mention how well the Vegas Strip would work with his visual style. 

I'm just saying a Refn directed Showgirls could be awesome. 

So I guess the discussion part would be, if Refn directed Showgirls, would it be good? Or is showgirls so bad no director could save it? 









 No Country for Old Men  




 Thank you! I totally realized it was long but I wasn't sure what to keep and what to throw out. I knew not too long after starting that I didn't have a whole lot of work. Unfortunately, the place I'm applying at asked for a resume *and* a reel. Because the local production company is relatively small, the job is basically a general all around job, looking for people with experience in editing, producing, writing, and directing, which I *do* have experience in, but I wasn't sure how the reel was supposed to show all of these things. 

 




 I made a reel for a job for a local production company. I've never made a reel before. I put [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By3l0nVnUv1hb2dlUE82WUppZlU/view?usp=sharing) one together, however it needs some serious work and should be way shorter.

What shots should I take out? What shots should be shorter? How can I improve this reel? 




 I really dig the [score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT1eNQWO9tY list=PLQCXD9Nsb1yZqmThf9wvxx5kTkd_RdKO8 index=14) for Birdman. This cool, jazzy, improv sounding percussions sound. What else will I like that is this style? 




 Was really hoping we'd see a Jaa vs The Rock fight 




 Title 




 I'm applying for a job and have never made a reel before.

1. What should be in the reel?

2. How long should it be?

3. Where do I upload it to?

4. Are there any good online guides to making a good reel?

5. Should my reel have a coherent flow that connects the shots?

Edit: I'm applying for a general writer/director/producer position at a small local production company.  









 I believe.  




 Glad to hear Spy is pretty good 




 I give it massive points for being something new and original. Every time I thought I knew where it was going, it went somewhere else. 

That said, I think the ending felt really rushed. It's wired, throughout most of the movie I felt like these two people really loved each other, but by the end it felt rushed and I didn't really feel that way about the characters anymore. I understand that the movie couldn't be longer but I wish it was. It's a pretty dense movie. There's a lot you don't understand throughout most of it, then when it reveals things it feels like an information overload. Not that that's a bad thing, but I wish it took its time to explain things. 

I really really loved the first 3 quarters but feel very lukewarm about the 4th quarter. And because of it, I came away with an overall lukewarm impression of the film. 

Like I said, it's great that it took a risk at being something unique, and honestly, it *is* unique. I just wish I liked it more.  




 I'm getting a haircut and I really like the look of Trent Reznor's hair. I'm having trouble figuring out how long it is though due to how dark his hair is. Anyone got an idea of how long the top and sides are?

 With Keanu getting older, I could see Josh playing Spike if Cowboy Bebop ever moves forward.  




 There are few things worse than when a movie has a good villain, but they give them an unsatisfying ending, what examples do you have?

Spoilers obviously 




 Because it's not really scary. More creepy than anything. It really doesn't hold up well.  




 I find it super interesting that Only God Forgives was too much for you and Valhalla Rising is your favorite.  




 Any particular ones you recommend? I went to EZ Pawn and the selection was super lackluster. Pretty much just TVs and power tools and a few instruments. 




 So I have two unrelated questions and instead of making two posts, I thought I'd consolidate.

Q1) What are some places that would have some good variety of men's hair products for sale? 

Q2) What are some pawn shops that usually have some good things and aren't *super* sketchy?  




 Meeska mooska 




 I don't like love ballads for some reason. 









 What song and what artist? 




 But with the callouses you would build from not wearing shoes, you wouldn't even need any shoes! Built in shoes rule! 









 You and me both.  




 Yes and no. According to the contest, if you were a rich dude, yeah you could pay a large sum to go to the premiere, but you aren't guaranteed to *win* and hang with RDJ. It's still chance and you'd only be increasing your chance to win. I mean, if I payed $50,000 and got 500,000 entries, there's still the chance, however small, I'll still lose and not meet RDJ.

Bad example, but at my middle school dance, there was a raffle for an Xbox and you payed $1 for 1 raffle ticket and could buy as many as you want. People were paying upwards to $50 or more. But the dude who won it only bought 1 ticket.

Miracles happen, man! 




 So in /r/animalsbeingjerks, they have a way to filter all of the posts if you wanted to see just cat posts or dog posts or bird posts etc. I don't know what the labels would be, but I think that could work here.  




 Yea I went to Blu-Ray.com and it has nothing on this one. Really hoping it's good  




 Cool! 




 Finally! Can't wait to get Equilibrium on bluray! 




 Also, the pacing of the movie is impeccable! It never drags 




 I love everything David Fincher has done, but for me, it'd have to be The Social Network. I just feel like this was the movie where David Fincer really took every technique he had learned and combined them together. Everything in that film came together perfectly. And you can feel so much of TSN's influence in his later work such as Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl, and even House of Cards. I always thought David Fincher was a great director, but The Social Network really elevated him a whole new level. Yes Seven, Fight Club, and Zodiac are great, but I feel TSN was the movie where *everything* just perfectly came together. No single part felt subpar compared to the other parts. The Social Network is just a much more efficient machine than anything he's done before and since The Social Network. But again, I love everything Fincher has done.  




 This is such a great movie that no one ever talks about 




 If this isn't /r/Retiredgif material, I don't know what is.  




 They were just like "Your wife is on the phone" and space ghost said" tell her I'm dead" 




 It was a super funny clip and I cannot find it anywhere. I don't think it was the one with Bjork? 




 I thought this was really bad. Whatever they were trying to achieve, I felt they missed the mark by a lot. 

It may be parody or satire, but despite the creator's intentions, it honestly looks more like a failed attempt to make an "adult" Power Rangers than an attempt to satire "gritty" action movies. 




 Exactly, people are like, "I can't believe no one realizes this is a joke!" but the thing is, despite the fact that it's supposed to be a joke/parody/satire, it's a really bad short. Mediocre at best. The reason some people don't see it as parody or satire is because it does such a horrendous job of portraying that.

Despite the creator's intentions, it honestly looks more like a failed attempt to make an "adult" Power Rangers than an attempt to satire "gritty" action movies. 




 Is there a lyric that really stands out to you as great in a, for the most part, mediocre/bad song? 




 I was thinking about this while listening to the radio on my way home.

 I still honestly believe that the difference between 24 and 30 is not that noticeable. Yes 30 is smoother than 24, but not by that much. It's all just opinion. 




 I don't think there is a noticeable difference between 24 and 30. I've shot short films in 24, 30, and 60 and I think 30 is close enough to 24 to where it isn't a big enough difference to matter. 

And I don't think it's just the frame rate that makes it more filmic. Like you said, aspect ratio, color grading, and cinematography are involved. Which The Order, I think, has some really filmic cinematography going on with its lighting. Some of the shots look straight out of a film. The aspect ratio also helps in this. I think The Order is an example of "What if we made a film into a game."

I'm not trying to defend this games short comings. I too think that the game is overpriced and probably won't be good. But I think out of all the weird decisions they've made, the 30 fps thing is the most believable and makes the most sense, even if they are just covering up a problem. 

I'm not saying that it's right for them to make it 30. I think it's very important for games to be 60 because every frame counts and can be the difference between success and failure. But if they are going for a more filmic and cinematic look, which it looks like they are, then 30 makes *some* sense. Or at least a little informed.  




 I'm just saying that with 60fps things are super smooth. But with 30 it just looks more filmic. So it does make some sense to me at least.  




 To be fair, there *is* a more "cinematic look" with 30fps vs 60fps. Not saying it's smart or the right thing to do, but I think they're being honest about that at least.
