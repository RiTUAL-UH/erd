 Tried both hard killing and clearing cache. I would like to be able to set the clock to 10 seconds for some exercises like the L-sit. I'm a total newbie and still use the lowest reps and seconds for each exercise. Values higher then 15 seconds works fine. Thanks again! :) 




 I have a problem after the update. Towards the end of my workout today my clock got "stuck" at 00:15. I cant change the seconds to anything else than :15 if I don't also add at least a minute. I can change the settings but as soon as i click "ok" the clock goes back to 00:15. It worked just fine when I started the workout. Maybe I'm the only one with this problem? Love the app! Thank you!  




 I have to keep reminding myself that even if I don't reach my goals as planned it's okay. I will get there eventually. Goals are fun and motivating and they should stay that way. Don't let them mess with your head. Soon you will reach your one year anniversary a much healthier person than before. Take a moment to celebrate your accomplishments and then keep on going for round two.  




 I would really love a Alana shirt.  




 Did my first episode today. Had three zombie chases and the first two was uphill. Really got me working harder than before. ;) 




 Thank you!  




 This is actually my first time with C25k but I used a similar program years ago when I first started running. I never stopped thinking about it either. Feels so right now. Congrats on your comeback too!  




 I'm starting Zombies, run! this sunday. My first goal is to have fun with that for some time. Then I will be working on both distance and speed. My longest run ever was 12k and it would be fun to beat that. I also hope to be able to run a 5k under 30 minutes some time. Not very ambitious goals maybe but they are enough for me. :) 




 Thank you!  




 Thank you! That is exactly how it feels. I hope that I will remember that feeling the rest of my life.
