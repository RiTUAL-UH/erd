 Haha Yeah it's like I genuinely feel good about it. I guess I could compare it to the same kick people get when they exercise. 




 Glad you like it! Although I'd suggest playing it sober first cause it's a little fast paced, just so you get used to the flow. You'll die a lot but it's so addicting. 




 I think everyone should seriously check out the other two games in the series though. Such a great trilogy. 




 For some reason when I smoke and I'm just chilling in my room I'll just have the sudden motivation to clean up and get organized. I feel pretty good about it too. Anyone else have this feeling? It's usually right after I toke, while I'm not burnt out or anything yet. Just kind of euphoric and calm. 




 Some people have mixed feelings about pixel art/top-down games but I highly recommend giving it a chance. The first one's only like $9.99 I'm pretty sure. 




 Definitely check out Hotline Miami. It's a two part game series, both on PSN. I can't even begin to explain how phenomenal this game is. Both gameplay and story. Music too. Here, check out a trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5AJtaYx1Eg 




 Why the hell were all the comments deleted on this?? 




 Thanks guys, I'll keep you posted! 









 That's exactly right but my perspective is that I'm just a little bored if there's no end game. Computers are going to keep advancing and advancing and advancing and it's not going to stop. There's always going to be something now that twenty or so years down the line is obsolete. To me it's just like "So what?". Whether you put me in Gettysburg or put me in 2057 it's all the same life. Progression doesn't really interest me. I feel like everyone is trying to reach an end game and people think society will reach utopia at some point but it won't happen. Not because (Well, not JUST because) we aren't progressing but because that would be an end game. It's always going to "get better" to someone but it seems like a vicious cycle to me that I just don't want to be a part of. I want out of the wheel that's turning and turning on for infinity with these delusions that it's all heading somewhere you know? 




 Dude I don't even know, it was two tabs of the strongest doses I've ever taken. None of my dealers have known about the doses so it's always been hard to say. I remember just looking around me and since I couldn't see anything it actually helped me to just focus on what I was thinking and I was kinda just like "I can't see anything... Well fuck." Haha 




 I couldn't agree with this more. I'm tired of the knee jerk reactions. 




 Welcome! I understand slight paranoia and auditory hallucinations very well, I've dealt with them a lot but it doesn't stop me from tripping still. I just recognize "I know that's not real, kinda adds to the trip, but it's not real. Most people would tell me not to trip anymore but it's whatever you're comfortable with really. The only thing that ends up frightening me is when I literally just can't see anything because I'm tripping so hard. It's like my eyes turn into wide angel lenses and I can see my center vision and my peripheral all at the same time and I start trailing on everything down to my eyelids opening and closing. Shit's intense and obviously not being able to see would frighten anyone but that's the only thing that really bothers me about intense trips. 




 It's okay, I didn't really get pissed off just a bit ticked. It's all under the bridge though! Nothing major 




 ASIDE: (Please do not read this and then read my wall of text, your perspective would more than likely be changed. This is my "self" interpretation of my perceptual glasses looking at this game.) 

Now I'd like to add in my "self" perspective on all this. I don't want to play the game at all. I want know part in it. I don't want to be happy or anything else. I enjoy the toys I have but at the end of the day I recognize that there is no end game and that leaves me unfulfilled. Am I depressed? Yes, but also not exactly. If anything it gravitates toward nihilism. All of my hobbies and interests go unfulfilled and eventually they no longer make me happy because I realize how very boring it all actually is. The only thing that makes me happy is making other living things happy, people obviously included. More than that; As a mere mortal ape I would love the opportunity to become no one in the next life. This isn't for me and I'm tired of playing this ridiculous game that goes on forever. I'm not necessarily suicidal, but at the same time I am. Really hard to explain to someone that you don't want to live but you don't want to die. From a young age I've had a fascination with miniatures from city building games to toys and everything in between. I was never very good at them though, because I never knew what the "right" move was because I've always felt that the "right" move is totally based on your point of view. I'd have more fun clicking play and watching it grow on it's own. To see all the little deviations it creates and all the wonders and disasters that come with every little variation with no influence from me because I simply can't make a decision on the "right" move. They're all the right move depending on your perception. This is the same reason I've always been a bad speaker and came off as shy or awkward in conversation (I know, now I'm getting personal but I'd like to get this off my chest.) Someone could say something to me and I just go blank, I don't know what to say next. It's really hard to explain but I think you grasp the idea. I could never decide on anything. Which pet, which spouse, which family member (Family is not immune to this.), which of anything because they could all be the right decision. It's kind of a curse really but I just wanted to get a little "self" and perspective into this. Comment what you wish.  




 The fact that you're conscious of all this leads me to believe that your mind and sense of self is in no immediate danger. I'm not going to say "Stop using it" or "Keep using it" but if you decide to I'd simply suggest firstly, waiting a while until your next trip. Some might say a few months, I'd say maybe even a year or so. Again, the decision is yours and I or anyone you ask about it could be wrong. After your wait, just take it in moderation. That's the key to everything. 




 It's so hard to think of where to start with these things because it's easier when I'm already tripping and the ball is already rolling but allow me to dip my hand in the pond and pull out a fish for you. My only disclaimer is that I want you to leave your "Safety Bubble" at the door. When I say "Safety Bubble" that means anything you've latched onto throughout the course of you entire life. Every idea and political party and agenda and emotion and morals and ethics and every little thing in between. That goes very deep and I don't think many people realize how deep the bubble is. Perception is a hell of a thing. There's no way I could explain this without hurting someone's feeling's or seemingly attacking someone's ideas but that's the whole thing. I'm even going to go against my ideas and feelings, no one is safe so to speak. These feelings and ideas aren't real, it's a facade. These are things based on human interactions. Not the interactions of everything in the universe. Every cell, particle, atom, animal, person, planet, idea, emotion, etc. of everything in the universe. There's so many variations on what "Sentient" is and I mean "Universe" in an infinite scale, past dimensions and everything in between. That's what infinity really is. There are no categories of physical, mental, spiritual, or moral that they lump together as a rule. They are all in the same tumbler. Categories aren't real. I could go as far as to say physical, mental, spiritual, and moral aren't even scraping the surface of this thing. You can see how complicated this really becomes once you start looking at it like that. I'm sure there's a better example for this but it's the first thing that came to mind: You ever seen Men In Black? The end, when the ornament zooms out and it's some life forms playing with the galaxy's as marbles? It's like that, it really is. It keep going whichever way you want it to, micro and macro. Going down as small as we've seen so far from cells to particles and atoms but it keeps going. The "Gods" just keep going and going and going. We are the gods of anything smaller than us and anything smaller than us is the god of anything smaller than that and so on. That doesn't mean we are gods of living things on earth, it means we are gods to whatever is on the next smallest level to living things. I'm not a biologist so I can't come up with an example but you see where I'm getting at. Our "Gods" have gods above them too, it's infinite whichever way you're going. I use the term god very loosely. I don't mean beings in the sky with whims and who you need to pray to. I mean things above us that can't be explained any other way than to say god. They don't have ideas or morals or physical or mental or anything in between. They are not just or unjust, they just are. That should go without saying but I really want you to grasp this. They don't have the "Safety Bubble" that is perception. Can they interact with us? Yes, but not directly. Think of it as a finger in a pool. You tap the pool and it ripples throughout the whole pool, possibly causing some chaos theory depending on what your perspective is. When they tap this pool, they can tap physical, mental, anything. At will? I don't know. They more than likely don't have will. Again, they just are. Maybe there's a way to keep your sense of "self" with you once you die and maybe that explains why things have gotten terrible for us here on Earth because one of them taped the pool for no reason other than will. Now, their gods can also tap their pool too. Their pool consists of the many pools of dimensions. See, it's all just tiers of pools. From gods down to a kid in a pond, it's all the same thing. Here's something to think about: Imagine an entity comprised of pools of dimensions. Crazy to think about right? It's like our dimension is just a cell in some other thing's "body". I'm sorry it's taking so long to explain this but there's a lot to cover and no good point to start so forgive me if I jump around a bit but I'll try my best to pull you (the reader) along.

So what have we got so far? Quick summary:

- There are no categories. Physical, mental, spiritual, moral are all in the same tumbler producing variant realities.
- Everything is a god to whatever is the next level below it. Micro and macro.
- Everything is a pool that gets tapped and ripples everything below it. From our dimension to little unicellular and multicellular organisms in an actual pond.
- These gods do not have the "Safety Bubble" glasses of perception. They just are. They may not even have free will or any will of their own. They are not good or evil. They just are.

So, let me explain this "Safety Bubble" a little bit more.

Like I said, everything you latch onto goes in the Safety Bubble. Ideas, morals, ethics, down to the littlest negative emotion you feel when I say something like "good and evil doesn't exist" or "Your loved ones don't actually matter". Striking any nerves? Leave them at the door. They aren't real. You only feel them for survival and that's it. Your body latches onto it, don't let your mind do the same. Ever watch Game Of Thrones? "A man is no one." That's how you play the game that we're all in. You can't tell people about the Safety Bubble or they draw back and get defensive. If you want whatever it is you want, you have to become no one. Let go of your perception and let your mind open up to all the possibilities because they are all true in a sort of way. Now normally people might think you have a multiple personality disorder or something or that you're a fraud or that you're shifty. These are feelings from people who are still in their bubble. Those things don't exist, it's not real. You can be whoever you want to be and that should go without saying again but it's only possible if you become no one. Yeah, it's less fun but you get more out of it in the long run (In this life) if that's what you're after. Although, we are almost cursed to run on happiness. If our feeble mortal chimp like minds aren't being amused, we lose it. We depend on happiness and that's not how progress is made. There are more things that need attending than everyone's happiness. That's only one emotion out of an infinite list from the emotional, mental, and physical that ripples through our pool. Take this information and hold it firmly. The second you start to "Feel" something or an idea shifts its way through, that means you're still in your "Safety Bubble" of perception. Get out and start playing the game instead of being played. They make new toys every year. New things come up in life that will keep you happy from people to ideas and activities and everything in between. Drop your toys and start playing the real game. Although, it's not exactly fun. Like your parents said "It's a lot worse when you're older". It's a lot worse once you're out of the play pen. Not "worse" though because that would be an idea. It just simply "Is". It's neutral, like our gods. 




 Dude, I'm with you one hundred percent. Sometimes your mind's eye is trippier than you thought. 




 Again, sorry for sounding harsh but I really didn't appreciate that comment dude. 




 I didn't say anything about "Getting high" or doing xanies.

After my come down and I'm feeling pretty normal and not tripping anymore, I still can't fall asleep. My brain feels like chewed gum and my eyes just don't want to close. Geez, always with assuming others reasonings or intentions. There are no set of rules on how to enjoy lucy. One guy could love taking a nature walk while another loves reading at home, they choose how to enjoy it. You chill out, I'm perfectly chill bro I just want to sleep when the trip is over for me. Sorry, that came off a little harsh and it's always hard to translate words on a computer screen. I'm not getting high and if you wanna get technical Lucy is a drug and we are all "Getting high" aren't we? Come on, get a grip dude. Trippers are not some elite group above all others you know. Sorry for coming off harsh but I hate when people try to suggest that someone's doing something YOU don't agree with and they should conform to your side of the table. This subreddit man, I thought I could come here to talk to you people but a lot of you turned out to be the same elitists that are in every group. 




 Or Vicodin? (I'm currently on a prescription for my wisdom teeth removal)
