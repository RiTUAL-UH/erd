 Hahaha, nah, its just a massive pork meatball that melts in the mouth. I've never been a steak kinda gal but I imagine this is what it'd be like. 

Its only called Lionshead due to the sheer size- about the size of your hands fisted together 









 **Rave**: OST C20- why did it take me so long to pull the plug with L-AA's? I have seen such visible results in the past week I have been using it and its worked so much better than my 50 bottle of Kiehl's Dark Spot corrector and SAP Vit C

**Rant**- What on earth is this huge cystic thing in between my brows?! I have never experienced any pimple being so painful and full of gunk. 




 Yeah, I have started spreading it down but the BHA and AHA just adds to the overall stickiness then I have like 3 ampoules....(Its summer and I'm talking full advantage of the late mornings I have :D)

I have got a bit of Mario Badescu's Glycolic Acid toner that contains so little AHA I'll probably use that to finish it off. 




 Oh my goodness, [that moment] (http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g246/sey115/sey115027/ya%20lil%20nasty_zpssjmzu0qs.gif) when it drips into your mouth and you taste it... 




 I have recently started using C20 before my BHA and AHA but because I've been very liberal with the amount of C20 I use (about a whole dropper to prevent wasting the product), it leaves my face very sticky. Should I rinse it off after the 20 min window before continuing with my acids? 




 Yeah! Sometimes I have to lie down or wring out some of the essence if I want to sit up. Unfortunately, I don't have access to Daiso here in the UK :( 




 I generally leave mine on for about 30 mins, although if its still wet I'll keep it on for longer. Some MBD ones are soaking wet and so I'll leave them on for longer. 




 RRS pretty much always marks it as $20 




 Paid on time and great communication.

 Same for me!! I don't have very oily eyelids but this still still smudges onto my lower lash line. I think I'm going to have to try a Majolica Majorca one or the Holika Holika Pole Mascara 




 Thank you for all your hard work, we shall all miss you lots!  




 I actually saw this on VHS but I know you can definitely find it online in awful quality 




 **Chunking Express** (1994)- I'm making my way through Asian films this summer and started with Wong Kar Wai. I loved Takeshi Kaneshiro in this and how his character thinks himself as a man but really is just a boy. 




 I love this film so much, Joaquin Pheonix really blew me away 




 Whisper slowly in their ear 'put it awayyyyyyy' 




 Seconding the Play 101 and Clio Gelpresso part, but I would recommend the Clio over the EH. The play 101 just *will not* stay on my upper waterline  




 Haha, no problem!! Show me once you're done ;)

Ooooh, also I would suggest you freehand the second coat. I left the tape on for the 2nd coat (when I took those photos) and when peeling it off, I couldn't get a sharp line :( 




 Yep, thats me too. I also go through phases of when my lips crack and nothing works so I have to buy more to use and more to put in different bags.

 Thank you! It's Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear in 20, Brick Red. First coat looks hot pink but with the second, its a true garnet/deep red 




 I stuck of 3M medical tape down but would recommend masking tape over any other tape, although the 3M one works better than Sellotape.

1. Base coat and a sheer pink to neutralise the 'half-moon' of my nail beds. I would advise against doing this as some of it later stuck to the tape and you'd have to clean this off before sealing with a top coat. I think a base coat will be fine, as the top colour covers most of the half-moon part of your nail (I don't know the technical term, sorry!)

2. Stuck a small piece of tape (about 4mm x 3mm but about 6x5mm for my thumb) down diagonally onto the nail. Make sure to press the tape into the finger to prevent any polish from bleeding.

3. Paint 2 coats of colour over it- I only used 2 bits of tape so peeled them off to do my other 2 fingers and freehanded the 2nd coat. Obviously this isn't necessary if you're using 10 bits of tape which I would advise if you want to cut down time.

Honestly, I'm getting into nail art but I hate waiting for my nails to dry and I'm lazy... so minimal designs are super appealing to me.

EDIT: I painted some nails again and [here] (http://i.imgur.com/wz9aR5a.jpg) is how much tape I used and how I laid it down
