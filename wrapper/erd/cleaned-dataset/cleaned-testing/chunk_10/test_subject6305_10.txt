 I don't really give a shit who I tell. I mean I don't just go around telling everyone, I have to know them enough to be generally comfortable. But if I'm feeling depressed and someone asks me what's wrong I'll tell them that I have depression and want to just be alone. 




 I'm terribly sorry to see this. No one deserves this pain. I'm experiencing something fairly similar unfortunately. I was with this amazing girl, we were fantastic. I knew she had depression and other issues, but I wasn't ready for her to get depressed then break up with me because she didn't feel able to be with someone. I've unfollowed her on Facebook but every once in a while I can't stop myself from looking and every time I look I experience heart shattering pain. She doesn't advertise relationships on Facebook, or her feelings all that much for that matter but when I look I'm just crushed that she isn't experiencing things with me. But this happened before and she may come back to me like she did before, but until that happens I'm afraid I'll feel this way. This extreme feeling of love and missing her. To make it worse, this all began when my depression and anxiety starting to really "bud" if you will.  




 My job isn't necessarily cognitively demanding, but it's more demanding than me sitting my room feeling depressed. So I use it exactly as you described the potential use for tasks. I even go to work like an hour early because when I'm at work I don't have the time to feel depressed, and it's a good distraction from my depression. Granted, the idea breaks down when we have slow night. I work in a restaurant. 




 I deal with this practically everyday. Everyday it's a struggle. Honestly, what I do is just tell myself that I need to. I might have nothing to to do that day, but to be a real member of society I need to get the fuck out of bed.  




 Everything. 




 Looks like I'm fucked then.
 




 Well in a sense they are, aren't they? They're contributing to the larger collection of media which does shape and define us as a nation (I assume you're talking about American filmmakers). I mean I hate these pretentious douchebags as much as anyone, but they are contributing. I may not be in a significant way but they are
