 same where the fuck can i get those? 




 these are the fucking bomb! What do you guys pay for them? I think my dealer is over charging me. 




 True, well I mean we already see people shooting up schools because they want to be famous and that seems to be the easiest way in an overpopulated super competitive society.   




 That's when we get a zombie apocalypse!

 Hi, I was just wondering where I can buy these fake samsung phones and also the fake apple iphones. I was wanting to get either a fake s5 or iphone 6. 









 Hi, just wanted to know if you can use the fake galaxies on a network since it mentions they are unlocked. I was thinking of buying one and using it with straight talk. 




 Wow ok I feel like we have both been clinging on hard to this relationship and trying to put off the issues but I guess it is time to face them. Thank you for your talking to a sometimes an asshole/ nice guy. 




 I asked and the response to that was no because she has to work. She works two jobs and I am trying my hardest to believe that she does not have time for us to hang out at all but it is honestly hard to believe. It has driven me to the point of almost cheating on her this past weekend because she is making it seem like we have nothing but yet won't end it. 




 Ugh that's the problem we both work a lot this summer, her more so than I so we have basically been at a standstill. I have asked her to take a couple of days off so we could maybe go vacation but she told me "I like work" I don't understand, if she's upset at me and does not think that we will ever make it then why does she not just break up with me. 




 Why has she put up with me for this long then? Do you think she is trying her hardest to forgive me and my romantic efforts are making her forget slowly but surely? Or does she just want to hurt me back first?
