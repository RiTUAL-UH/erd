 Your posts are not wasting time but probably are your current job.  Have a good night Clinton operative. 




 I think you know why I think you are on reddit. You are good at what you do. 




 I think you know the answer to this question. So you think me doubting Hillary Clinton's non-answer answer on the TPP makes  me a conspiracy nut.  




 Or you could make up a better reason for not posting links. Most people who like reddit post links and comments. I do not buy your reason for not posting links. 




 I rarely find this is the case when I post a link. 




 Vulcanfactcheck I have a question for you. Why do you post only comments on politics and never post links?   




 The Clintons have always been for corporate free trade deals.  




 The reason as stated in her official position and what is her real reason is often two different things. Your use of language makes me think you are a lawyer. 




 We all know Clinton is for the TPP. 




 He is the flying spaghetti monster's gift to the Democrats. 




 The article highlights how Bernie Sanders believes he is different on trade than Hillary Clinton. 




 The article is about trade and the TPP and is less than 45 days old.  We all know where Hillary Clinton stands on the TPP. She is for it. 




 The TPP is a current event. 














 I just signed the petition.  




 Probably not much. 




 She is a kid not a professional. 




 I think you know the answer.  




 Guitar not guiter.  




 Yea my spelling is not always the best. Guitar not guiter
 




 Someone needs to start a change.org petition for this man.

 Better than I will ever be. 




 Got the point. It's a guitar. 









 I signed your petition. Here is my petition.

 Maybe she is a troubled artist. Still cool in my book.
 




 I can't keep a tune and from my misspelling of guitar in title it seems I can't spell either.  




 You get the point. Enjoy the video. 




 Should have put this meme in the /r/conspiracy. 




 Good music may have a future. 




 Thank you for link. Going to check it out. Today was the first time I watched some of her videos. 




 She has mad skills.  




 May Oswald rot in hell. RIP President Kennedy.

 Your disappointed. You have no crowd. Buddy. 




 Go away. 




 Lot of campaign contributions. 




 " I looked the man in the eye. I found him to be trustworthy. We had a very good dialogue. I was able to get a sense of his soul; a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country" 
Quote from George W. Bush about Putin.

 It would be nice if this was currently possible. 




 Go away buddy.  









 Reddit needs to make it's website a "safe place" for corporate advertisers. The bean counters don't understand that if this change takes place they will lose most of their users.  




 Most private institutions are funded by corporate donations. Jonas Salk's polio vaccine was funded by the government. I appreciate your opinion though.
   




 /r/science won't allow me to because my idea has not yet been replicated  though peer review scientific research. That is the purpose of this petition.  




 Thank you for pointing this out. I am going to contact the MRSA foundation and request they provide these two links.
