 The video appears to be edited around the 30:00 mark when the officer is telling his version of events. What's up with that? 









 Omg, I interviewed with these guys too! I don't think it's a pyramid scheme necessarily, but it is shady. The person I spent a day with actually laid out the strategy, but I forgot the parent company name. 









 Israel has repeatedly stated that they hold Hamas, as the purported governing body of Gaza, responsible for all attacks that originate from the territory. As you can see from the year after the war (September through May, at least) you can see that Hamas can indeed control when rockets are being fired or not, even if they are not directly participating.

The point is that there was an effective 19-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which Israel broke, leading to a war in which 67 Israelis died.

Unless of course you hold the easily defensible position that the kidnapping of the three teens by Hamas operatives was in itself an attack by Hamas, thus breaking the ceasefire themselves.

Or the previous opinion, that since Hamas controls the Gaza Strip, every rocket fired is in itself a violation of the ceasefire, whether Hamas does it themselves or not. 

[Especially when the text of the ceasefire in 2012 states plainly that rockets attacks from **all Palestinian factions**, will cease.](http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Text-of-Israel-Hamas-cease-fire-agreement) 
 




 I think you meant 2014, not 2012, since that's when the article was written. And though Hamas might not have directly fired rockets during the prior 19 months, rockets from Gaza were a constant threat throughout 2014.

  No, it indicates large-scale oppression. Anti-semetism being merely present won't fill you with constant suspense, dread, and fear of being murdered. Jews don't have those concerns in most places today.

Today, maybe. But in the past 2000 years this has been true in many, many situations. 




 Just so you know, he's wrong about the date. According to scholars, the Torah was written (compiled) in the 5th century B.C.E. in the time of Ezra, during the return to Israel after the first exile. Yes, the Roman exile was actually the second! This is how the deutoronomic prophecies are explained -- they are said to be written after they have occurred, when Babylon/Assyria invaded and exiled Judah/Israel. Still doesn't explain how accurate they have been for the entirety of the second (Roman) exile.

Also, the key phrase you are arguing "a language you will not understand" can be translated in several different ways, one of which is "a language you will not have understood" due to how tenses work in the Torah. It's complicated.

Random side fact: This entire section is called the Tochacha, or rebuke, and is read very quietly in synagogue when it comes up in the yearly cycle. 




 Old Testament = Tanach, of which the Torah is only a part

Tanach is the acronym of Torah, Nevi'im, Ketubim; Teaching, Prophets, Writings. 




 yes, no, no, yes

I try, though I've lapsed recently. Maybe this will be the motivation to get better! :)

 Yes, they're bullshitting. 




 My spreadsheet is just a compilation of mods, none of them are mine. You're using one of the four I recommended above (#178) which does seem like the best presented one. But like I said before, I haven't used any of them myself yet. 




 They're in the URL. So 17 is http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/17/ 

Change the number to 40 and you get http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/40/ 

Alternatively, go to [my spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zStz8eChga1xHsntz2qKyBgK_BCy9_S-Pvnx4DfKRYk/edit#gid=0) and scroll down to leveling. 




 ...This is a blog, not professional journalism. 




 No to both 




 Look at mod numbers 17, 40, 178 and 186. Those are all the mods that can potentially slow down XP gain, but I haven't tried them.

 Can you say more about the mutinies? I've never heard of these before. 




 Is that the best of the 10+ Gamepad mods, do you think? 




 Check out [my mod list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zStz8eChga1xHsntz2qKyBgK_BCy9_S-Pvnx4DfKRYk/edit#gid=0)! There are three mods to slow down leveling, if it's going to fast for you. I also recommend the console mod and the saddlebags mod if you need more storage space. 




 Not if you want to carry around all the Witcher swords and armor. 




  At that time the festival of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem

TIL Hannukah is mentioned in the NT. 




 To correct your arrogant post, I've had a flag in the back of my car before and I'm definitely not a racist. It's the mindset of ignorant people like you who are making this a race issue. Sure, some people who fly it are racist. There are plenty who don't fly it that are racist as well. I'm from ~~Virginia~~ Germany, and around here it is the ~~rednecks~~ hillbillies that primarily fly it, but there are also historians that will fly it, as well as other prominent figures. ~~Down south~~ In this country, it's heritage. I didn't have any family members partake in ~~the Civil War~~ WWII, but there is a large battlefield in my town. It's history. It's becoming a case of "Don't tell the true history because it'll offend people". Yes, there was ~~slavery~~ mass murder and racism associated with the flag. Yes, the ~~south~~ Third Reich was harsh to them AT POINTS (not every ~~southerner~~ German hated ~~people of color~~ Jews and other "undesirables."). But it's history. It's the people who want to make it out to be a race war that will make it so. 

Doesn't look so good now, does it? 




 Then you acknowledge that you're incorrect, not pass it off like it fits with your claim despite the contradiction. Saying "I was wrong" might be hard, but otherwise you're not debating honestly. 




 Oh, I've played. But I didn't finish because my shitty laptop couldn't run it. 




 What kind of problems? 




 Are there any disadvantages aside from having steam open? 




 I currently have morrowind on a disc, gotten as a gift over 10 years ago. I had to download cracked versions of the DLC to be able to play the game with mods. 

Now I see that Morrowind is $5 on steam. Is it worth it to buy? How easy are mods to install? 




 If he did everything else and began building the Temple, but it wasn't completed, then maybe. Otherwise, no. 









 Of course the Old Testament doesn't have an ending, it's not supposed to. The ending is how we live our lives.  









 To be fair, a lot of them in Beitar Illit are Hareidim.  




 Yes, the writeup is bad. And? 




 Just because the pronunciation of Modern Hebrew is influenced by Arabic and English doesn't mean the languages aren't extremely similar. Speaking might be difficult, but reading accurately can be compared with modern and shakeperean English.
 




 Gabriel means "Might of God," Rahael means "Healing of God" Elijah means "the LORD is God." We could go on all day. 




 Mizrahim (correct me if I'm wrong) spoke primarily Judeo-Arabic. 

Arabic, Judeo-Arabic, and Aramaic were the languages spoken in the Arab world.

This isn't accurate.

He is right, you're right. Modern Hebrew is close enough to Biblical Hebrew that it can be compared to modern English and Shakespearean English. Yes, you might have trouble with it, but they are extremely similar. 

However, the inscription found is not Biblical Hebrew script, but one older than that. It does use much of the same grammar though. 




 Oh, I agree with you. It was just a tip to make the game a little less annoying. I also use the drag and drop trick. 




 I chose to spare him and never got that mutagen :( 




 For the humans just always have hanged man's oil applied. Now you only have 1/3 at a disadvantage, and you're always prepared for people jumping you. It's the only thing you can put on the steel sword anyway. 




 The crafting mutagen part was fixed already. The reassigning them to get their base enhancement was not. 




 I've actually found ones which I can craft, weirdly enough. But they are the minority.  




 Good analysis. Just two points which can be contended: 

 The off-screen death: Brienne, who appeared for 8 seconds in the whole season, appears Deus Ex Machina to kill Stannis in the last minute. No explanation. No build-up. No stakes. How did the writers foreshadow this? By openly having Brienne telling the audience she was going to do so during those 8 seconds. 

She actually had a scene earlier in the season about wanting to kill stannins, and how it conflicts with her duty to find Catelyn's children. Then the scene earlier in the episode where she is torn between watching the tower and finding Stannis actually starts the drama.

Myrcella declaring her love to his father just to die in his arms --with no reason to have that knowledge-- serves only shock;

eh, you can argue she learned it in dorne, coming off the whole disscusion of nobody in dorne caring.

But yes the episode felt rushed. In fact, it felt like I was waiting for the actual finale after this ended.
 




 We know Jon is murdered. The issue is whether or not he comes back. 




 They find the nest, then see the wake, then find the ring.  




 Brienne of Arc! 




 Does this include any of the DLC? 




 That's not how it works at all.

His mother is Jewish so he's Jewish. He will always be Jewish but if he marries a non-Jew his children will not be.

The other woman actually has a point in Reform Judaism. They say if the child isn't raised Jewish, then they don't as Jewish if only one parent is. That shit gets complicated.  




 It's oglaf. That's the only answer you need. 




 I did the werewolf quest after yen left, it was fine. 




 The Conservative prayer book edited the original prayers slightly to make it ambiguous.
 




 Hey at least we don't have anyone like that as the darling of left wing news networks or actual elected representatives. 




 It's a list of all mods on Nexus. I don't think I've seen anything gamebreaking yet, but as always with mods, use at your own risk! I edited the OP to make this clear. 




 Lol, most of these are probably conflicting, especially the graphics ones. I'm just keeping the list so people know what the options are. 




 Go do the main quests. Killing things gives you very little XP, and doing over-leveled quests/killing over-leveled monsters doesn't give you any extra. 




 I've made and been maintaining a mod list of all the mods on Nexus so myself and other people can keep track of them and choose the best ones. I've been keeping it up to date as much as I can. It doesn't have a lot of information about each mod yet, but it does include the link, title, Nexus # and author for each one, separated into categories. I hope this helps you! 

Remember:  Use mods at your own risk! This is a categorized list of of mods, not a recommendation.

 Not much. But if you like roleplaying and story the first one is fun to play even with the annoying gameplay. 




 To add, it comes from computer code/searching: abcd* means search for anything that starts with abcd 




 I was really disappointed with that, having imported a Shani save into W2 




 I imported a save and it was there. 




 Which version are you using? Overwriting or quickbms? 




 I'm not sure it's better than the original, but kudos to the author/artist. It was adapted very well. 




 Dr. Schroeder book on genesis in only semi scientific, fyi. The idea is nice, but his analysis falls apart under careful reading. 




 You can turn off the question marks on your main map. Bam, one section of your complaint is gone. Happy? 









 Ran out of vRam? something similar happens in Skyrim 




 I had the same problem, and I eventually got onto a ledge in that corner. It just took a while. 




 There is none; this is just a comparison to past Witcher games 




 So Poles weren't oppressed? 




 It's not compressed vs. uncompressd. It's old vs. new. The Quickbms program which unpacks and repacks the bundle files has a limitation that the files you reimport cannot exceed the size of the original files. Therefore, when editing, you have to make sure anything you add is offset by the same amount of information you delete. 

I don't know why Quickbms works like this, but it is an annoying limitation for now. 




 Same! 




 What? I'm using nexus as the basis of my explanation.  




 If you're confused about any part of explanation, just tell me. I know I've assumed some knowledge of modding the Witcher 3 and command line, but this became long enough as it is. 




 No idea. Email someone? I already tried posting in the forums. 




  

Right now, every non-graphical mod requires that you install its files in a maze of folders which you can quickly get lost in. If you've installed more than 5 mods by now, you realize how confusing this can get; it can be hard to remember which mods you've installed or how to uninstall them.

 

Credit to polymorpher for their initial explanation which allowed me to understand this. If you haven't read that yet, please do so because I'm assuming that you have that knowledge. [It can be found on Nexus here](http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/14/?). Unfortunately, they only explained the what and not the how. I'll go over that now quickly.

 

**Explanation of how installing the mods work** (modders, skip this part):

 

Every non-graphical mod you're installing has a similar set of instructions. It requires you to navigate to the directory "The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt\content" and pick a specific subfolder, such as content0 or patch0. then you open the "bundle" folder. This is where the bundle files are kept that contain a lot of the games information that you can edit -- again see polymorpher's explanation for more detail.

 

The instructions ask you to paste all their files directly into the bundle folder. No, you cannot create a subfolder because of how the files work together. There will be a few things that you are always putting  in there:

*     Quickbms.exe
*     A folder
*     A .bms file
*     A .bat file

If you read polymorpher's guide, you should know what most of these do. Quickbms is the program which unpacks the .bundle file, and the .bms file lets you run quickbms properly. The folder is the output for the .bundle file, and once you edit the output, what you reimport to the the .bundle file.

 

However, the .bat file is a little different. In general, the .bat extension is a way to tell your computer to run the command line (cmd) for the computer. In these .bat files, the modder puts in code which tells the computer to open quickbms and and then gives the program instructions to reimport from the edited folder -- the same thing you did manually in the tutorial, but now done for you. If you know anything about code, you know it has to be very specific; the code can't choose what files and folders to use like you do when manually running quickbms. The modder has to code exactly where the files and folders are. This means that if you install anything in the wrong place, the program will tell you that the process failed.

 

The standard code for quickbms:

quickbms [options] script.BMS input_archive/folder [output_folder]

A sample code used for Witcher 3 mods:

quickbms -G -w -r witcher3.bms patch.bundle MyMod

The code does exactly the same thing you did to reimport your code by clicking on a few different screens. More information on how to use quickbms is available here: http://aluigi.alterv...rs/quickbms.txt

 

The better modders also give you a way to uninstall the mod. So you also are given another .bat file, named uninstall_mymod and another folder which contains the original code for the game that will be reimported.

 

**Why does this matter?**

 

So the modder chooses where everything goes, the user has to follow the instructions exactly otherwise the code doesn't work. This is creating a headache for everyone; people are confused, modders are getting complaints, etc; and this is creating a file structure mess where you might not be able to install or uninstall mods correctly.

 

My proposed solution: There should be standard method of installing mods in a specific directory. This will solve a few problems:

 

*     Modders don't have to provide the quickbms and witcher3.bms file in every download. Since these are the same with every mod, we can keep these in one place. (And not rename witcher3.bms every time!)
*     A file path separate from the rest of the witcher 3 content means that files aren't scattered or lost. This makes finding them, and hence installing/uninstalling them, easy.
*     A standard set of instructions for installing mods so people don't get confused by all the different ones.
*     For future updates, it's easy to see what is or is not affected.

Now, after all that, my solution is rather simple:

1.     Everyone should create a folder called Mods in the Witcher 3 game folder (the name doesn't actually matter, but it's good for standardization).
1.     Quickbms.exe and witcher3.bms will be placed within mods
1.     Each mod should have it's own subfolder within Mods.

That's the easy bit. Of course, now the .bat files are in a separate place from a lot of the files. I'm going to use the Over 9000 mod (using the 120 edit) to show how to solve this.

 

Original code: quickbms -G -w -r witcher.bms patch.bundle 120\

 

Changed code ..\quickbms -G -w -r ..\witcher.bms ..\\..\content\patch0\bundles\patch.bundle 120

 

The ".." means move to parent directory. So the code says:

1.     Move to the parent directory and launch quickbms
1.     Open the GUI (-G), allow the program to write (-w), launch the reimport function (-r)
1.     Move to the parent directory and use witcher3.bms as the script
1.     Import the information to: Two parent directories up, then the appropriate folder
1.     Use the information contained in the folder 120 (which is in this folder) to import

You can do this for any mod yourself by moving the files to the places I specified, then right clicking the .bat file, hitting "edit," and changing the code as I wrote above. 

If we do this, then a lot of headache will be alleviated and this will hopefully start us coalescing into an actual modding community.

 

And thanks to all the modders who are the ones doing all the hard work! 




 Still not a great solution - there should be an "exit to game" button. 




 /r/isrconspiracyracist Spoiler: It is 




 Because he posts there a lot 




 It's a bug. Drop the ones you have to make new ones. 




 I have that too! It's just randomly sitting on the Oxenfort river 




 It's still bad even with rolling. 




 It's for grey quests. Green quests give the right amount. 




 There's a cheat if you're on the PC - you can drag and drop oils to apply them even while in combat. As for the rest, start out as combat and then respec at lvl 15. ;)

 Someone at nexus posted another mod to get the debug console working. It's not me, I was just going through it to update my mod list. It's pHaZic, who credits Skomsi and Zanzer. Free camera is back! 




 Thanks! Here's my list from before, revised with the patch updates:

**Important:**

* Fix fall damage! Make it less, automatic roll, etc. Maybe a potion. We should be able to jump from heights like in the Witcher 1 intro video.
* ~~More key bindings, fix some of the ones available. For example, right now sheath and dive can only use the same button if you keep the default.~~ FIXED, STILL NEEDS WORK. The biggest issue is the hardcoded bindings while in the menu
* ~~Swimming Controls~~ FIXED, TESTED
* Horse Controls (ex. doesnt stop randomly, reliably navigate around objects, automatic jumping over low barriers) SOMEWHAT FIXED
* **Storage**: Please give innkeepers stashes like in the two previous games, or maybe a 'Travelers Storage chest' at all inns so we don't have to talk to someone to access our stuff. There are many options for this, but I would like to have all the types of witcher armor and swords available somewhere, though not necessarily on me. Maybe Roach should be a storage chest?
* More options, especially for potions and bombs, in the quick access wheel, like this: http://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/374d3l/anyone_else_wish_they_had_something_like_this/[3]. This isn't necessarily the answer, but applying oils, switching bombs, and drinking potions is cumbersome right now. It would be alleviated somewhat with extra tabs (see below), but not entirely.

**Combat:**

* Jump while in combat
* It seems that if the sword is out, all other items deal ~ as much damage. Is this intentional? 
* Larger axis of rotation when aiming crossbow and bombs. There's a small limit right now, and sometimes I can't shoot high enough to hit flying monsters.
*  ~~Auto sheathing swords sometimes happens while still in combat but a little far away, or an archer is targeting and you can't parry because you didn't close yet.~~ FIXED
* Option to manually turn on and off combat mode.

**Economy:**

* Merchants need a buy back feature at the price it was sold at. Maybe this should be in a different tab so that the sold items don't clog up the main screen.
* The buy/sell ratio should be more equalized. Right now it is a little ridiculous for both gameplay and immersion.
* There is very little coin in the beginning of the game, and lot once you hit level 12 or so.  
* Food and alcohol prices are extremely high.

**HUD:**

* Adjustable minimap size
* Slower and larger combat and item log
* A toggle button
* Smaller size possible~~
* Being able to move it to the actual edge of the screen (adjustable settings don't get it quite there)~~ FIXED
* An option for a compass/clock without the minimap

**Map:**

* Zooming out more
* Quest filtering/switching on map; maybe have the option show all quests in grey, and clicking on a marker makes it the active quest.
* Multiple quests shown
* Option to show a map of the inside area of a cave on the large map screen
* Custom notes
* Icons for merchants, blacksmiths, and armorers dont disappear when they unload
* The world map is hard to scroll with a gamepad, the cursor sticks very aggressively to icons.

**Crafting and Alchemy:**

* Monster mutagens could be disassembled/be used for regular upgrades
* *A sort function in the crafting window, perhaps by item level or damage/armor so that we don't have to look through everything to find the best one.* **A filter menu was added, a sort function would be even better.**
* NEW: Ingredients and alcohol should be listed as already owned when in the inventory
* Mutagen bug: Need to reapply them every load in character page to get the base bonus
* Tabs in the dismantling menu
* The collapsible menus should not reset.
* Choosing whether or not to replenish potions and bombs when meditating; and/or choosing to refill potions without meditating.
* ~~Hide feature for already crafted potions; on the same note, don't replace the old recipe with the enhanced one.~~ DONE!
* Crafting should also have a item is already owned notification when confirming so you don't make something twice
* When dismantling items, show how much of the components I already own and how much they are worth. How am I supposed to make a decision between dismantling and selling if I don't know if a component is rare or valuable?
* Highlight new recipes
* Allow us to auto-buy missing materials from the vendor if he stocks them, or double clicking on the material from the crafting screen to craft it.  Now you have to look at the material missing, look for it in between a huge list then look what do you need to craft it and search again.
* Possibly remaking a piece of equipment to rise its level to your own

**Quests:** 

* Have active quest appear in the quest menu when opened, and save the drop down state.
* Make the flavor text of quests and glossary entries more friendly when they update.
* Easy searching of completed quests.

**Inventory:**

* New tab for Books, Letters, and Notes
* Books and scrolls should have an additional tooltip line indicating read/unread
* Books and letters should have the option to be read when picked up/looted, instead of having to find it in the inventory
* New tab for food or potions/oils/decoctions
* Different tabs for crafting  amp; alchemy
* A sort function with multiple options (weight, price, quality, level req., name, etc.). Or more minimally, don't sort them by pickup time, because this creates a lot of clutter, especially in the usable items tab. (Potions mixed in with decoctions, etc.) In addition, have mutagens autosort under the rest of the alchemy ingredients by color; right now they're mixed in with the rest in a random order.
* A tab for Gwent cards in the inventory 
* When buying from a merchant or looting, items should have a line in their info popup that states either "Owned: (#)" or "Unowned"
* There is a lot of dead space on the screen. Either expand the grids or use it in another way?
* **Maybe**: A list option instead of a grid system

**Other/Controversial/Inane:**

* Better navigation of menus (e.g. quick exit)
* Option to turn subtitles off for English/chosen language but keep them for the other languages in game in order to understand them.
* More higher level quests
* Better leveling -- doing all the side quests leaves you way over leveled
* Better trophies
* Fix item weight (feline armor set should not weigh more than griffen!)
* More things to do, people to talk to after the main story
* Rewards that correlate to quest level. My blade of the bits was level 15 because that's when I started the quest, even though I ended it at level 19 or so. My masterwork sword was outclassed by the time I got it.
* Assign a hotkey for reapplying current oil
* Being able to loot under your feet. You currently have to move a little.
* Option to reduce the frequency of background music playing. 
* FOV slider
* Fist fights should not immediately start on a cutscene ending. There isn't enough time to react.
* An expanded glossary: Herb locations/descriptions, cities/factions/locations, etc.
* ~~The drop rate for some alchemy substances is low for rare monsters, like a golem heart or ekkimarra hide. Can we get either the monster to appear more often, a higher drop rate, or special alchemy merchants to sell these for high prices?~~ FIXED. Still need to find my golem heart though
* More gradient speeds
* Cloaks and hoods would look really cool
* Camera zoom in and out, if possible.
* Ability to pause cutscenes.
* Meditating should save the game.

**Extra Requests: (Ignore this):**

* Romance DLC
* Allow Geralt to imbibe more alcohol.
* Ability to give money to beggars
