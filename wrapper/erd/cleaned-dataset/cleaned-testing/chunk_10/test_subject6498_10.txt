 If you don't want to read Pippi Longstockings I can recommend Ronja Rvardotter or Brderna Lejonhjrta. They're not aimed at as young an audience as most of her other books. And are more in line with traditional fantasy genre.  




 First post here. 

I enjoyed The Lost Symbol on a vacation 2009. Almost as much as The Da Vinci Code. But after having read almost 300 pages of Inferno, I just don't feel it. 

The mysteries and puzzles are nowhere to be seen, and it feels like the plot has been one big chase for a third of the book. (Run! Oh nice hiding place! Oh fuck, the police! Run! Oh nice hiding place! Etc.) 
The secondary character is pretty interesting but hasn't had that much of screen time. 


I just want to know. Is the book worth getting through? Does it get as good as the previous two books in the series, or close to it? Because as of now I just want to quit it.  




 I'm more amazed by the quality of the Russian video than I am by the fish.  




 I'm sure it must seem that way if you only ever read the comments of the posts that hit the front page and never actually watch or read the stuff we are talking about. 




 A large portion of Canadians are religious it seems to me. I think that would be the biggest difference.  




 Also apart from has already been said. We love eating at IKEA. It's a fairly cheap meal with well rounded plates. Oh and the coffee is free with a family card.  




 Except in my country. Where parents stay at home for more than a year to take care of their newborn.  




 Americans don't see tax breaks like that. When they hear "tax breaks" their minds directly go to the new iPhone. Not "more expensive health care" or  "holes in the roads" 

And this is their design.   




 They don't need to appear. It was the atmosphere and setting that made Firefly great. Another crew with more recent actors would do just as well if the feeling was right.  




 2) They understand how economies work and would like our country to do well.

Oh boy... I'm sad to see you think this is the case. I hope you're a shill or your perception of the world is beyond rescue. R. I. P. 

In case you want to know. Profit, profit, profit.. That's the sound of music for banks and so many other institutions of our time.  




 She won't win saying: "the obviously crazy person, is crazy" 




 Yeah sure. But I'd rather not see Fox standing behind it.  




 Praised be the day Nathan Fillion purchase the rights to Firefly. We will pour money at him like he's our childhood crush turned prostitute.  




 Inte fr sitt jag r srskilt insatt, men jag kan tnka mig att information var mer vrdefull och svrtkomlig p 1940-talet. Vart det fanns stridsfrrd, vilka sorters fordon som var inkallade, vad fr sorts trning soldater fick. Osv. Osv. 
Vad en person visste var kanske inte allmnt knt. Och det var viktigt att de som visste saker inte glappade kft.  




 Omigod. You're serious then! So what does this meat have in mind?"
 




 Thinking meat! You're asking me to believe in thinking meat! 




 Or that computers often translate code written by programmers several times before it reaches binary code. 

It's not as simple as ones and zeros.  




 Meat?  




 She's pregnant huh?

 And the fact that the kids only want the licensed marvel, LotR, and mainly Star Wars sets. I'm only 23, but heck. In my days we built hospitals,  and stuff with no instructions..  




 In response to the recent automatic/manual cars. 

Statistically, future cars with perfected automatic driving will have made manually driving cars basically illegal because of how often humans cause accidents compared to automatic driving.  




 I think so too. It's like lifting on a grain of sand and saying. "Nope no life on this planet."  




 That's not really a theory is it? No one sees you the way you see yourself. Your image of your best friend is not the way others interpret him or her. It's all in your head. Everything is in your head. And everyone has different images of everything.  




 That's how I read the story.  




 r i Spanien sedan tv veckor och vrt kranvatten r godare n deras tappat p flaska. (uppvuxen p bde koppar och jrnberikat vatten och bda smakar godare) Miljfrstringen som kommer av alla dessa plastdunkar/flaskor ska vi heller inte tala om.  




 I thought the Greeks thought of Zeus and his fellows as humanlike in appearance? And that's how you get the half gods like Heracles (hercules) etc? Because the gods had some fun times with mortals.

 East land if you want to go swimming. A night in Kalmar and one on land is what I would go for. land has some weird rules regarding RVs if I'm not mistaken.  So  you light have to go for a camping site there. (Bda camping has a great beach)

 I get all warm inside when I am reminded this is standard procedure in Sweden if you have a steady job.  




 Soon (very soon) I'm going on a road trip through Europe. Our route is basically

Lbeck -
Stuttgart -
Milan -
Marseille -
Barcelona - 
Alicante

If we get tired of CD's and Spotify playlists it would be nice to have some old fashion FM radio to listen to. If you know any good Radio Stations avalible along this route. Please share.

Both music and talking (english speaking though) stations are appreciated. We are fans of rock, pop and metal of different kinds. 

If you got a favourite station that is not in English but plays good music you are free to share that too. 

Thanks

 Hahaaaha. Tack! 




 You been watching to much "Midsomer Murders" boy? ;) 




 Pokemon Blue on Gameboy for me. That shit was hard when you were 8 years old and had to ask your mom what stuff meant.

I think I was better than her when I finished it 




 That's because Japanese sound like bawses talking all the time.
And I'm not even an anime guy. 




 Ey. Snacka inte skit om Curling ;) 




 A Reflective vest in yellow is recommended on the countryside if you are going to spend a lot of time on the roads. 




 And dat Lewicki, dat Augustinsson, Lindelof och *Carlgren*. Carlgren, Carlgren 




 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN.  




 Some of his leaps from the sides were fantastics. But Lewicki. He's passing by unoticed everywhere. Winning important fights and putting the passes just right to open up for a great shot. 




 Try refresh. Got black screen once too.

It's Swedish TV 4 Play. Don't know if it works outside of Sweden (if not try VPN) It's without account restrictions for everyone that can access the stream. 




 Thanks! Not really a soccer guy. I mostly watch the national team when there's an important game. It's mostly no fun watching Sweden. We mostly suck at football except for the obvious exception 









 I'll be in my bunk. 




 Ja, importskatt p ktt vore vl det bsta alternativet eller r jag fel ute?

 I kind of added a "Tonight"  at the end. John Oliver need to make this happen.  




 Well at least they are open with their opinions. I don't think Fox News are especially open..  




 And then rise again two hours later.  




 That's it man. I was just about to drink some tea and eat some scones while watching an episode of something before bed.

I have seen two episodes of the Wire a long time ago but didn't get into it. I'm gonna give it one season. Starting now. 




 There are great characters in every enjoyable TV series. But in some shows there are characters that take the series  to a new level thanks to a personal trait, terrific writing or just the actor's interpretation

My favourite has to be [Al Swearengen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWGhuZiSPM4) of Deadwood

What's some memorable ones?
 




 That's too much American history for me so I don't know what you mean. But I think that would work.  




 I'm an outsider and have 0% knowledge about how election for Senate and Congress works. But I'm fairly sure that IF Bernie becomes President he will be able speak to the entire American and everyone will listen. Once he has that power he will say that there is a dire need for everyone to take a good look at their representative local politicans and make sure they have voted in their best interest. If not. Find someone who has and support them instead.

If he wins. Things will change for the better for you. Mark my words. How much will change basically depends on the American people's political involvement. 




 I don't think you should throw this in a rural area where people can see the butt if you want to make use of the seed for a tree anyways? So that is kind of a moot point in this case. 

Of course littering has a psychological effect that just causes more of the same, but that is not really relevant with this tree cigarette since it goes to waste if it's thrown on asphalt and such. 




 How is it littering if it's biodegradable? 
 




 I'll make a vid tomorrow night when I get back to the countryside. 
Here's some love from Sweden in the meanwhile.  [ABBA](https://youtu.be/uP0sC_s5EfE)

I'm pretty sure that when media gets that the next president of the united states (touch wood) have mentioned Sweden as well as other Scandinavian countries as models for healthcare and education it's gonna flood our news.

We are mighty proud of our healthcare system. And we love to hear the praise of it.

 




 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 




 It's a joy to read! But.

You posted to the mobile site. Here's the more [readable article](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/06/19/1394126/-I-m-changing-my-stance-on-Bernie-Sanders)
 




 Is this coming up at Bernie's official youtube page?  




 You know. Even though there apparently are people who have romantic relationship with cars. I cant help to think you meant "boyfriend's". 




 I hear this was streamed. Where is the video? I would like to enjoy the atmosphere even though I probably have hard what he talks about. 




 And me 




 Great one. But I'd like to add: "And has stood firm on those issues for 20 years." 




 Real estate, farmable land and woods.
How safe would that be if there was a crash? 




 Tyskar r vi toleranta mot, srskilt vi som inte bor i stder. Ni str fr en stor del av vr turism och jag sttte s sent som fr 1 timme sedan p ett ldre tyskt par med hund som firat midsommar i Sverige. 
Vi hade faktiskt sommargster frn Berlin i mnga r nr jag var ung. De hade alltid med sig mngder med l och choklad till vr familj. 




 Thank you very much for that answer. I will look over everything again and make sure. I wouldn't want my safe travels app to become... Yeah.  




 There are no communication other than a follow request. You request a friend to follow you by name and a random generated personal key. That personal key is then used as a foreign key between the two friends in the database

This is the only info about the user that is stored in the MySQL database. There is a web service you can visit, but there is basically only a link to google play store there.

I'm sorry if you don't get enough information. I don't know how to explain appropriately.

I'll make sure to double check the protocols and take a look at Auth2. 




 I broke down for a split second. I am so humbled how kids take the prospect of death :( There was a girl about the age of 10 in my community who had a similar scenario, I don't remember what illness she suffered from. But she took it with about the same calmness. Although I imagine there was some real  grief  behind closed doors their strength is astonishing and truly admirable. 




 
Ah. The flowery penis. Let's dance around it!
 




 I know about the bomb, but if anyone is like me. They might miss something that is literary in front of their eyes their whole time. I do that all of the time. Once I lost a tv controller for two weeks, and it was beside the tv the entire time..

We need to get people really aware of the moneybomb before it's time. 




 Ha ha, I think I want you to explain. :-) 




 I have thought about it some. And I think he must have existed in some way of another.  




 The location data won't touch a database ever.. Only temporary stored locally within the app and on the friend's app that you have actively chosen to share your location with. 

When you choose to end the sharing,  all stored location data is erased from both clients.  




 I'm sorry. That was a good comment you linked to. I didn't go that far back as to more than a *month back in time* But I still didn't see a post from you in this sub, and the few ones I saw on the subject of Bernie were strangely familiarly formulated not discussing any policy of his. Just broad key words like socialism, anti globalism, stagnated economy. Etc, etc. 

I didn't accuse you in that sense. It's just there has been A LOT of fresh accounts coming here trying to cool things down. And when you didn't answer my question if you think Bernie has got enough name recognition but instead talked about how neutral you are  I began suspecting something was wrong. And I waited a good while before I said something about it. 

I just thought that everyone agreed what Bernie's main concern is, is a certain other runner's name recognition that Bernie really lack. And found it weird you didn't think so. 

Not everyone needs to be a vocal supporter. I don't think that. 

I'm sorry if I offended you. I hope we can put our "pitchforks"  down and be civil. You seem like a good guy that stand up for what you believe. And hopefully we can end this discussion here on good terms because I really don't have time to do this anymore.  




 I can see how that's your response. No previous post or comment in this sub, and your first one is to stall this going viral.  




 First. I know there are Israeli communities that work. That's not relevant when talking about Bernie Sanders. So why you would bring it up to a hater is beyond me. And why you would hang out in a subreddit which very name is "Bernie for President" and not think he will win the general if he wins the primary. I'm not a campaign representative either. Heck. I won't even before for him. Because I can't. But Me and dare I say it everyone else are in this sub to promote good ideas on how to make Bernie the next president. And I don't feel you have done that at even a single time. 

And second. Your first response basically said that you think the name recognition Bernie Sanders is getting from msnc is plenty. And you think this viral campaign is "badly timed" 

I'm calling it. Call me a loony if you want. I think we got a Shill. A sneaky one at that. 

And that's all I got for this time folks. I don't have time for this anymore. But that's my opinion.  




 That's great. I would love to be able to donate. But am neither allowed to nor have the spare money to do so sadly. 

And of course you should be open minded and I praise you for it. 
But I looked and you haven't written anything positive at all. Not that is perfectly clearly positive. 

And you even wrote in a thread about bernie in response to someone who don't think socialism works.... in /r/politics and I quote: "Actually. Socialism does work out well.....When applied on a small scale like the tiny communal villages in Israel." 


I know that YOU know that he isn't a absolute Socialist. And you explained that in a later post. But people won't always read every answer all the time. And I don't think that the first comment you made really benefit Bernie. Actually it is kind of a shitty comment to make if you advocate for Bernie because the American people don't know the difference between branches of socialism. 

And I think everyone here that wants more followers of bernie need to think about what they say in relation to him because not everyone know what he talks about. They might only know he's a Socialist and that is what we need to change. Correct me on that last statement of I'm wrong. And any other statement or assumption I made.

But I think my opinion is well founded, and I would love someone's opinion on that. 


 




 I'll eat your other one. And I'm gonna tell you how to accomplish that. Exchange Students. And I've been saying this for a while. 

American students abroad, and foreign students in America will make this a global issue. I think Sweden can use a bit of the billionair talk. We abolished the inheritance tax some years ago..... And the new budget yesterday didn't mention the really wealthy... 

And I'm sure it's not just Sweden. UK got a real (real)  problem too.  Some insanely rich Swedes are actually moving to UK because of this.  




 edit: So.  You think he get's enough name recognition? 

Just to end my curiosity. How come, every comment you previously made about bernie make about him or any of his policies come across as completely neutral but seems to point towards pre ww2 politics, anti globalism and other short general expressions?? There is no positive feedback. Only subtle resent as I take it. 

I'm just curious and you are free to explain this and we're done here. 

Because we have different opinions and mine is. 

The time to act, is now. Not later.  




 I hope to see your work here on this sub. You're good.  




 Edit: I see how my point didn't come across at all... . If people would have their eyes opened to how different Bernie is to every other candidate just because the fact he didn't take money from any big companies or other interests. You might be able to get it to stick.. HARD

That said. 
I think name recognition is the top priority right now though?  




 It is really appealing over all.

And the text is really soothing. Although it didn't fit as well in the other video where there was a person in the centre talking. It kind of stole the show.  




 Maybe the Bernie [offical logo](http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l217/Shockwave_73/Album%203/Bernie%202016_zps32ug56jh.jpg)?

Or is that not allowed? 




 Agreed. Now that it's out there in the pit that is the internet we have to act quickly. 




 EDIT: IMPORTANT  **Tl ; Dr** conchobarrmacness has no previous post  in /r/bernieforpresident.  and  we have a long and extremely boring discussion below. My opinion: I think he subtly speaks against bernie. That may be because that's just his way of expression. Or it might not be. Quotes below. 
two comments down he basically says this video campaign needs to go viral later,  not now because Bernie already got a lot of name recognition.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  (he never respond to why he said that, even though I ask him several times) 

On an ending note, after the "wow"  response. I'm positive. This needs to go viral asap.

End edit. 


A viral video can include something that puts another candidate in a different light than they are currently in. And it is achievable by just speaking the truth in good manners. Without saying anything negative about anyone. 




 What the hell is that about? What are new account's posts about? This should be informed about on the sub. 




 **I** like the feeling of the hashtag, but bern could easily be made into burn (something like "socialist gonna burn capitalism to the ground" or something crazy and untrue like that. It would scare a lot of people) 

Propaganda is already active, and soon they are gonna be desperate


I just don't think it's worth the risk of it blowing up in our face in a couple of months. 




 It's a 15 second video. 1 day notice would be enough notice to get to a hairdresser and record 5 awful videos before finally getting a good one. But let's say we wait for 3 or 4 days just to get the message out on doing this thing. We need to be coordinated. 




 Let this post reach the front page first. Which it probably will.
Anyone **keeping tabs** on Bernies movements have already got hold of this, but not his casual followers.
We need them to come along. 




 Same here. As a European I really don't know anything I can do except spreading his message here on reddit.

 




 Did you make all the graphics and pictures and stuffs for "Society, A Perpetual Cycle"? or just parts, like the text? (which works superbly well together with the voice) 




 I'm watching it now. Yeah. It's like he cares. Feels weird.

Europe too huh? :)

edit: Don't forget to post the video directly here on this sub so that it can get some well deserved attention.
