 Thanks for your advice Scrubstadt.  By the way, this:

If you accept that dying will happen, and try your best to learn from your deaths, the deaths themselves will become less frequent.

is a badass quote. 




 Thanks everyone for your great advice. I'm going to pick the game up and get stuck in, and bear with it a while. Can't tell you how appreciative I am for your comments. 




 Thanks for your advice VonStreff. Yes I must say I have been put off by the Dark Souls reputation but great to know that Bloodborne is still enjoyable. And I suppose 1 death per hour isn't bad! 




 Hi everyone,

This game is so highly rated and looks amazing, but I would really love to know why it is that you like it so much. I really want to buy this game and like it, but the idea of constantly dying and reloading in games doesn't really sound like my cup of tea, it just sounds like punishment.

Do you really die every 5 seconds like people say? And do you have to be an amazing hardcore gamer to be able to play? Are the lowered difficulty levels?

Any advice is much appreciated!
 




 Ayy-oh!

 Hi guys,

Located in BNE, Australia. I have been having huge problems with ISP traffic congestion on my ADSL2+ network between the hours of 5-10pm, which I understand is peak traffic time. What is frustrating me is that there appear to be few other options available for a steady data transfer rate at all times.

My wired connection runs at 10mbps during the day, then drops as low as 0.5mbps to 2mbps at peak times, making streaming video difficult.

Is a 4G WIFI router a viable alternative? I get download rates of 100mbps over the 4G cellular network at peak times and this would be far more preferrable.

Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing?

 That's what happens when you wear burlap sacks for shoes OP 




 What the f...where am I?? 




 Cain married his twin sister, and had children with her, and Abel had children from his twin sisters. It is indeed mentioned in the bible (Genesis, chapter 5, verse 4) that Adam and Eve had also daughters: And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters. 




 Ah yes I see. Whoops! 




 That just made the verse super funny to me 




 I thought so. So why are some Christians so up in arms and using homosexuality as their argument? Seems if they have a problem with being gay they should protest that instead of marriage? Marriage has never been a solely Christian tenement so I feel I must be missing something here......??? 




 Can someone help me out? (non-American here). 'Man shalt not lie with a woman as they do a man, it is an abomination' - this seems to be the go-to argument. But they're referencing homosexuality which has been legal for more than 50 years. To me this is not the point in case, today's ruling is a victory for civil liberties and equal rights, not actually being gay. Or am I wrong here?

 Wow that is some mild annoyance 




 Thanks for the feedback! I'll add this one in as an option.

 The top two comments on a tumblr post are always something along the lines of:

* *wow*
* *this is fucking thought provoking*
* *this is the deepest thing I've ever fucking read*
* *truth*

Who are these people
 









 Also, 1ml (or 1cm3) of water weighs 1 gram, and takes one kilojoule of energy to heat it by 1 degree Celcius. Aaaaahhh the metric system :) 




 Lots of employee comments here, I wondered if anyone could lend advice from the other angle; I am a manager of a small business, I have four fantastic hard working staff under me. I can almost never fault their effort and detail the put in. How can I reward them for the work and show that I appreciated them? And also, if the constantly give me 100%, how can I make sure they don't burn out and keep enjoying what they do?

Any suggestions welcome - thanks all. 




 I was born in '22 and I am 93. 




 What the f.... 




 Very true, I hadn't considered the smaller builds. I think I'm with you, the $400 doesn't seem worth it. Thanks for your advise hghdra, much appreciated. 




 Yeah...tell me about it. No space for a PC set up, and I need the 17" screen and internal optical drive as my wife needs to use it too and it's her compromise. It's frustrating, because I know I could build a better PC for far cheaper! 




 Yeah, it's a fair amount of money...AUD2199 to AUD2599 with the 970M. But, comes with Witcher 3 included so I've got that going for me I guess. Haha. 




 Hi all, trying to decide whether the extra ~$400 is worth it to upgrade to the [P37W](http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5349) from the lead in [P37K](http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5375). The laptops are not cheap so I am trying to keep it reasonable. I specifically need a relatively high powered, thin gaming machine with internal optical drive at a min 17" screen.

From what I can see, the only difference is the upgrade from a [GTX 965M](http://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-965M.134120.0.html) to a GTX 970M in the P37W. According to GPUBoss, the 970M is up to 35% more powerful, has a larger memory bus and higher clock speed.

Does anyone have an opinion as to whether the GPU upgrade would be worth the extra cash? I'd love some help. Also, please let me know if I am overthinking things and the 965M is perfectly solid.

Thanks! 




 Oh great, thanks bernie. I'll check these out
