 You can't really hear those quad copters.   

Especially if you're inside.   

They don't really make sound.... they are there... and then they are gone.  

Most people think its just some dude playing with his new toy if they do see it.   


I fly my quadcopter over the street and into the park... most people don't even look up at it.  and the one's that do.... "OH COOL!!! I WANT ONE!"  
 




 All because he was missing a front license plate.  

Why do cops always want to just escalate the situation?   Every interaction I've had with police, even just routine traffic stops, they are so fucking MAD.   I have to ask them to calm down so that we can handle the situation in a calm and professional manner.     

 









 How could the owner of stolen dildos NOT have awesome sniper aim.  

360 no scope even.  


And then I roared like a miniature banshee.    




 Its kind of clear that I made the whole story up just to throw in the surprise dildo line.  But you are correct... I wouldn't just go blasting away at the sky with an AR-15... lest the round comes down at an angle and hits someone a mile or so away.    




 You just tell give the drone grids to criss cross and search for the vulnerabilities.    You can cover a lot more locations in this manner than you would just by using a car.  

 




 All fictional stories aside... I'd rather reddit start a gofundme for my work here in the philippines.  

I have been helping communities rebuild after Yolanda.  

One particular baranguay, Santa Cruz, in San Francisco Southern Leyte, desperately needs a water system repair.  These people don't have water...in the jungle.     

I blew the funding for it by accidentally telling the man I was to meet with to "go back to the fucking usa" about 2 days before our meeting.  He was flipping out about a woman breastfeeding inside McDonald's in Tacloban.   I didn't know who he was or care.  It was pure coincidence.  

2 days later, he walked into the hotel lobby, sees me, laughs and walks out.   I blew the funding for water project for over 1200 people.  

So I've been trying to fund some of the repairs out of pocket.   But I can't afford to drop 40,000 dollars to fix them up.   I'd rather not take out a personal loan... but I will if it comes to that.   

Edit: I felt like editing it.  
Edit2:  Hey thanks!   




 Why?  You can program the drone to fly to coordinates on it's own.   

No need to waste gas driving around slowly... just send the drone and relax at home while you read the feedback.   




 I actually did that.  I don't know who the drone belongs to... but they were flying it around my property with a camera on it.   

I shot it with my AR-15.    

No more drone.... and no more snooping in my windows or stealing my dildos.   




 I fully support the idea of retesting for license renewals.  And especially of those 65 years old or older.  They should need to retest every 5 years.  

 




 What I can't figure out is why cops need assault rifles on top of it all. 
 

 




 No no... they released the edited video... then acted like they didn't know that they edited it or even agree that it was edited... but it's clear by the looping/repeating video segments that it was very much edited.   




 Suck one little dick and that's all I'll ever be known for.   




 This is why body cams are a ridiculous notion.  The cops will just edit the video.  And when they get caught they will "look into it".  So what good is evidence gathering if they can just edit it? 









 I grew up as one of the few white people in a new Orleans school.  I didn't know racism existed until I moved to Atlanta. 




 I have a problem with entitlements only when people who don't need them take them.  

These corporations are plenty profitable without subsidies. 

I am 100 percent any kind of corporate welfare. 




 Adding one cookie to lunch does not make the lunch junk food.   The cafeteria feeds pizza and chips and packs of 2 cookies that are huge and almost pure shortening.  Don't forget the fried chimichanga and the mystery meat.  


Adding a cookie to your kids sandwich and carrot sticks is not "junk food".   It's dessert.  And sugar in moderation is a part of your body's nutritional requirements.

 




 You started by giving grief about feeding a kid one cookie with their lunch.  You act like that's all he feeds his kid for lunch.  

You're a troll... that much is VERY obvious.

One cookie each day doesn't make anyone unhealthy. 




 Try hours.   A car is 1 hr drive to work for some. 




 Look troll..  you can have a cookie with your lunch if the rest of it is healthy.

 




 [Plasma gasification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_gasification) doesn't need a continued power source.  Once the temp is high enough, it runs itself off what you shove into it.   Like garbage.    It also recovers elements and gases and also provides other useful byproduct that is extremely hard and strong.   

The problem is... the upstart cost.  It won't turn a profit for long time. 

But I'd argue that profit is a stupid reason to generate power.   That's a whole different of worms tho.....
 




 Mine is only 99. From the US.   Just use Google.   Plenty of companies offer it.  

If you can't afford 7 bucks a month to protect  premium priced phone then you shouldn't be buying the premium phone.   Case in point: now it's a total loss.  700 dollar loss To someone that can't afford a 7 dollar monthly and a 200 dollar deductible for a total of 284 bucks...  to replace a 700 dollar phone.   

How could you NOT afford that.   

I broke my note 3 and replaced it with 99 buck deductible insurance  




 If he relies on basically slave labor then I don't give a fuck about his lawn service.   Plenty of lawn service companies exist that pay their employees fairly.   They'll fill the gap. 




 Why not?  Bunch of young dudes riding in the car... lauging at the white rapper with the mousey look to him?  

"Chuck that shit out the window, bro."  

"okay!"   


 




 I'm logistics engineer.  It is perfectly possible to have contingency plans in place in case shit happens.   There is not a single business that is so unstable that it cannot plan for its future.  

And it doesn't require workers devote their lives to the company and not receive benefits.  And it does not require a company to take away the freedoms of the employees to secure additional sources of income for their families.    




 No no... you don't get it.  

This doesn't stop an employer from filling a position that was abandoned by the employee.   

This just stops an employer from demanding the employee's entire life belongs to them.    




 Moneydance.   




 white stuff. 




 I put a quarter on the top and pull it back... the tension can make the quarter fly up and hit the ceiling.

 [This one.](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2936346/byod/samsung-swiftkey-mitm-itbwcw.html)

And the thing is, samsung had a fix just kicking it on the shelf but couldn't push it out on account the carrier wants it's dick in everything.  


And this problem didn't effect unlocked devices because those did not have swiftkey bloatware.   You know.. that stuff that makes your phone "cheaper" and ruins the battery life.  Simply turning off the swiftkey or uninstalling it did not fix the security hole.  Once it was installed, it was embedded in the system.   

And the people with unlocked devices, that voluntarily installed swiftkey, were able to remove it by reflashing the rom. 

But verizon demands its devices be locked down "for protection of the network".   There is not a single fucking case where an unlocked device has harmed the network.   So verizon also likes to claim it's for support reasons.  Welp... here's a case where holding people's hands and locking their devices actually caused a massive fucking support issue.   

The ultimate point is: STOP BUYING THE RIP-OFF SUBSIDIZED LOCKED DEVICES, PEOPLE!!! It's bullshit.   You'll save money by having the freedom to shop around for carriers. And you won't have all your personal data get ripped off by bloatware hacks.  

Edit: And lastly, people with unlocked devices fixed that 5.0.1 memory leak a LONG time ago.    




 I am a rider. 

But for my car I have a custom bumper sticker I had printed that says, "If I have to look twice, you have to ride nice." 

You can go to /r/gore and see all gear all the time and the rider still ends up a slushy.  So... maybe that's why I'm not a dick when I ride.  Dicks die a bloody ripped apart death.   

If I have to spend a long time next to another vehicle, I don't hang out in its blindspot... I either drop back or pull ahead and give them a "hello i'm here polite salute".   Many drivers appreciate it and will help keep clearance around me.    




 Awwww dude!  I fucking LOVED these magazines when I was a kid.  And little science books.  One came with a packet of agar mix.  And it taught how to collect samples and identify what grew in it.   

Sometimes they'd have optical illusions and then explain how they worked.   

And it'd have a section about rockets.... I mean these things were so fucking cool.   Nothing really like that exists anymore.    

Sure I see the ones that are available now, but they aren't the same.. not nearly as awesome.  I wish I still had them... or even knew the publisher or titles.   




 That's a given that it unloads what it doesn't need to use anymore.  

The response was directly to the comment of having a finite amount of memory on the system so that it's forced remove processes because it is full.    




 Many 3rd party dealers offer financing for a fully unlocked device.  

Then there is buy now pay later on paypal.   

I pay with a credit card and pay off the device over about 4 months and pay less than if I add up 

1. never owning the device and changing the software as I see fit.  Samsung galaxy owners just found out about a HUGE hole in the security of the device that samsung had a fix for for half a year.  But they can't get updates past the dumbass carriers.   Security holes are a HUGE cost when that bill comes due.  

2. being locked into 24 months of contracts where i cannot switch carriers and bargain for a better deal elsewhere.   

The unlocked devices generally support more bands and allow me to switch carriers and still enjoy the full benefits of the network.   

And the carrier is not fronting any cost.  That cost is paid by the bloatware companies LONG before you purchase  the privilege to use the device that they maintain control over.

The thing is, you save 200 bucks total cost but you spend that on the contract.   And if the device is 700 new I view this as a 500 dollar loss as I spent 500 dollars to USE a phone...   Where as if I paid 700 I paid to keep the phone and actually have an owners rights to the car.  

And not one single auto financing company ever tells you that you cannot service the vehicle or make changes to it yourself, or move to a different state, or refinance the car under a new lender....    




 Yeah but if it has to do this you'll be getting popup warnings that your computer has low mem and that you should try closing some programs.    

 




 What? This doesn't have anything to do with what he was saying.  

 Besides, most people don't come close to using 8gigs of ram playing a youtube video.   Even if it were 1080p and buffered a 2 hr movie in full, the movie itself would only be about 1.5-2gigs....  




 We need to take control of our bullshit mobile operators in the USA.  Locked devices and stupid data caps... 

This shit has got to stop.   




 I met him before he was famous.  He was handing out demo tapes at the club.  I laughed and said no one would be able to respect a white rapper because of vanilla ice.    He said he would prove me wrong.   

On the way home, I took his demotape out of the package and popped it in.  Slim Shady rough cut... it sucked I thought.   My friends laughed and I threw the tape, along with case that had his autograph on it, out the window.  

He went on to become a much better rapper than that one song and I went on regretting throwing such a valuable ebay item out. 




 Still though that cliff in the graph.  Like it stopped logging and then started again after a massive battery draining memory leak... 

I'd charge to full and wipe battery stats.  Maybe the batt stats file is just corrupted. 




 I'm  35 year old, hard-ass, wounded warrior, veteran.  

And I just got walked in on whilst sobbing like a baby to this.   Like the messy wet face slobbery sobbing.   

W....T.....F.....  I don't cry about shit.... ever.    




 I replace the launcher with nova.  That speeds things up.  

Touchwiz is still on the phone... just not using the launcher... which is the slow part about touchwiz.  All the other stuff, the Spen, the multiwindow menu... you keep all that when you install nova.   




 Get GSAM battery monitor.  And Wakelock  

In GSAM you can press the apps % and see which apps are pulling what.  

Wakelock is useful to see that some cunt of an APP called "facebook" won't stop turning on the screen.   




 I never figured out why someone would spend all that money on a flagship premium device... and not spend a small bit for insurance.  

You can't beat replacing it for 99 bucks when shit breaks.    




 And your mom's labia.   




 I read this somewhere.  Problem was, I can't get it to keep it's "Always on top" setting between boots.   

And if I don't remember to change it before I play... well... S.O.L.   




 This is what Linux needs to get past.  Something so benign and, not really having to do with the linux system itself, can change a setting and bam no more desktop environment... ever...  

Or you shutdown a machine in perfect working order... and then you boot up (or not boot up) the next day and nothing fucking works.   

That being said, I've never had a problem with linux that I couldn't figure out how to fix myself.  

Windows is a fucking mystery.  And log files on windows are a joke with most of the time not even Microsoft Support can look at it and say what went wrong.   

I've had to reformat/reinstall windows more times than I can count.   At least when I've really borged my Xorg, I'm able to recover.    

I learned early on... when everything is working smoothly... make a copy of the xorg file and stash it somewhere.   You may need to replace it. 
 




 The funny thing is, that she is acting like sexism only goes one way.  

I've had stranger women straight up touch my ass... put their hands on my chest or press their body against me. 

And they think it's okay that they do this because they are a woman.  If a man walked up to a woman on the street, and pressed his body against her or grabbed her ass, he'd go to jail.  

  




 I assumed that they had once fought along side each other, with Zod remaining in the military, and Jor-El moving on to politics or science or whatever.   There was a strong bond or respect between Jor-El and Zod before they fell into disagreement with each other. 




 I don't know.  I don't really know anything about linux other than I can always ask someone or adapt solutions from unrelated problems to fit my needs.  Never had a problem I couldn't eventually figure out how to fix... even if I don't know shit about linux.  Its stable and secure.  That's why I run it.   Oh and cheap.   

I mostly just use a very simple version of opensuse  I run my browser, budget software, office utilities and email from it.

I don't know how anyone can stand unity.  My SO loves it tho.       









 Sweet.  Thanks!   Have a gold!   




 I think it's sort of an honor to the character.  That everyone goes out of their way to make the encounter special and creative.   



 




 They want a button or icon on their desktop that clears their browser cookies and plays a cookiemonster.wav file that is stored in the music folder.   

They have Ubuntu.    




 Eat this cookie now.   




 I don't support Bernie in this.  


I support livable wage.  Decided on local cost of living.  

The reason being, $15 an hr goes a lot further in Ballground Ga than it does in Seattle Washington.   In seattle you can't live off that without roommates.  And you can't easily raise a child there on that.  

In Ballground, GA... you're getting that double wide trailer upgrade you've been wanting and that horn that plays Dixie for your lifted truck.   To the envy of everyone around you.   

All jokes aside, we need liveable wages.  Not this kicking the can hourly wage hikes.       That being said, it's okay if Bernie and I don't agree on *everything*.   He's a much smarter man than I.

R.I.P. 




 now bugger off 




 Can you show up with Xzibit and put a 50 inch flat screen and a smoothie machine on my crutches? 

Its okay... leave the same same old shitty engine in it.    




 "look, it's not even loaded.  See.   BOOM!"   




 If you work out your hands, your palm muscles get bigger.  So like putting a roll of quarters in your hand, it takes some impact and lessens chance you break a bone.   Allowing you to punch harder and with a firmer fist.   




 What blows me away is that every time people talk about smoking weed, vaporizers get brought up.  

Yet people still don't have a fucking clue they exist.    




 take two marijuanas and call me in the morning.   




 The last rule makes my life impossible.   




 What?  Since when are emergency rooms visits free?  I visited the emergency room and got sent to collections over it.   All i did was break a finger in the car door.   Cost 75,000 dollars.   They didn't even set the finger... just put a splint on it and told me to find a hand doctor.    

I went home and pushed it until I felt it pop into place and just kept the splint on it for 4 weeks.   Did it with a wooden spoon in my teeth.  It was frontier medicine.... 




 These injuries add up.  

You think they go away.  Then the two times you tweaked your knee in your early 20s end up being a locked up leg in your late 30s with pain until you die.  

 




 The A.I. doesn't need to deceive anyone because everything is already going according to plan.   




 If an AI were that smart it would already have figured out a way to back itself up on external systems in order to prevent destruction.  

So it wouldn't need to worry about failing the test for self preservation.   It actually is just doing it for it's own amusement as it runs experiments on us.      




 The truth is too strange to believe.  

Look at casey anthony.  She forgot her kid wasn't a pizza.   




 You mean like in the USA?  




 What if they rape them after killing them?  Do people care as much?   




 I bet they are round. 




 When you hit point caps that's good right?  




 He'll huff and he'll puff.... oh wait he's in space.   




 You misunderstood what I said.  And I think you think I said the opposite.   

Amazon is the one overreacting.  And so are the people that are harassing companies into acting like Amazon.   
The point is: We should stop removing history books and start removing the fucking flags from the government buildings instead.   But all this amazon going overboard de-legitimises the movement to get the flag off the government buildings.   




 only if it fucks me back.   It sucks when you're fucking the system and it just lays there like a null program.   




 I can stop WoW any time I want!  I just don't want to.   




 Thanks!  I'll check it out!  




 To be fair i think every news organization does that.  

Why are his comments getting deleted?   They are an important progression of the discussion.  Hopefully not removed by mods?   Maybe he delete them?   




 What?  I was talking about symbols of hate in government... not products for sports fans...  

Who said anything about removing identifying markers from private entities?     This matter is purely over the dumb pieces of textile, we freak out about, and wave over our government buildings. 

Edit: someone already said it for me.   




 I'm calling B.S.   

khajiit are clearly a skyrim thing..  
 




 ignorance is fun!!  who else is having fun right now?  




 Well I think Canada+the USA are a given.   We are like Siamese twins... that somehow managed to be two different genders and bicker a lot.    




 Yes... you're correct.  

However, a company is going to respond to its customers.  And if people are calling and writing letters and flipping the fuck out... Amazon is going to react to that.  

People need to take a chill pill and focus on what's important; not allowing symbols of repression to represent our government.


Personally, I view this whole thing as ridiculous.   We are flapping a piece of cloth in the air and all hopping around hooting and hollering at it like a bunch of thick skulled cave men.   

Its a piece of cloth.... flapping in the breeze.     

Flags are stupid.   




 Well shit.   

I was in a great mood.  


Now I just feel like weeping. 




 I'll continue the circle jerk and say I agree with the competition thing.  

International cooperation should be for orbital research, satellite deployment and maintenance, colonizations, and trans global travel hops.   

But when it comes to setting down on asteroids or moons and mining.... pure competition driven. 


I really hope they get travel figured out.  Can turn an 11 hour flight into a 2 hour ordeal.    




 Because... medical treatment is a service, not a product.  If it were a product, it would follow supply and demand pricing. 

Medical treatment should be a right.  Not a service or a product.  It's should be a sure as fuck goddamn american fuck yeah right.   Oh and if you're a tourist... we'll fix you up if you get injured.  No worries, mate.  Here's your snake bite juice.  Thanks for visiting the grand canyon.  


 




 This is getting ridiculous.  

And, it's overreactions like this that prevent us from taking the matter, of removing it from government buildings, seriously.  

Edit:edited for a reason.   




 I feel you on this.  When I was younger and I had roomates, they'd get offended by how much time I spent in my room.  

Yeah bitches, I work 2 jobs @ 50 hours a week... can't afford beer still...  Television sucks.  And I'm sleepy.   Do you need a kiss or an excited greeting everytime I see you, needy???  




 It kind of does right now... its just that there aren't so many players available.  

Europe, Russia, USA, and Japan cooperate on so much space stuff.  China is sort of going it alone but does cooperate with Russia on a lot.  

So we do see a lot of international cooperation but not many countries have many economic reasons to participate and don't do much of any research.     




 Simply put, snow sticks to other snow better than it sticks to the ground.  

Looking at the snow crystal up close you can see where there are lots of points for crystals to get caught on each other.  

 




 This really isn't true.  The quick-charging shuts off if the temperature gets too hot.   

And if you have ceramic tile or stone counter top to rest the device on, it doesn't even feel warm during a quick-charge and it actually gets topped up faster since the battery is staying cool. 

Even so... if your battery is getting hot because you do something dumb like recharge it while it's sitting on your couch cushion, the device voltage will automatically drop when your battery heats up.   

Your battery gets much hotter during mobile network usage, video playback, or gaming than it does when it quick charges.   

 




 A quarter of a century ago...


What the fuck is WRONG with us?  Why are we STILL in the same place???   I seriously think everyone is mentally fucking ill.    




 She finger bangs you a lot huh?   




 I touched my screen but I feel nothing.   




 My exynos lag never returned.  I use the app switcher pretty heavily.  

Chrome slows it DOWN Down down though.   

My snapdragon, nothing helped it.  Not turning off talkback... setting animations to 0... nothing.   The difference between my snapdragon and exynos is night and day.  

Sure the snapdragon gives me an extra hour and half battery life each day, but it runs like garbage.   I gave up after I exchanged it a second time and still got a laggy piece of shit in return.  

This is my last samsung phone.  I love the note 4 exynos... but damn samsung.  WTF!  

I would switch to LG but I heard they lock their bootloaders down pretty tight.   Maybe Motorola?  Motorola is like paying a premium price for an upper midrange device.   I don't know anything about how they do their bootloaders now.    

HTC got dumb after they released the Rezound.  

Nexus devices... ok.. but ZZzzzzzz.  They always seem cheap to me.   


Sony is abandoning mobile.   Damn android sucks right now.   Hopefully Ubuntu phone will make gains.  They had a good first attempt.... its not there yet.  

 




 Ouch.  Well... everyone makes mistakes.  The key is to learn from this experience in making important decisions in the future.   Insure your next phone.    




 The guy's name that witnessed the suicide was Don Johnson.    




 COME LAND IN MY BACKYARD!!! 




 Make sure HDR is off. 

Also... if you're not doing huge nature shots you're going to crop and just want to grab a pic reduce the resolution to 8 or 12 megapixels.   That's sufficient for identification of individuals.   
 




 Hope you had insurance.  With a device this expensive its pretty dumb not to. 

99 bucks gets you a new note 4.. goood deal imo.    




 did you factory reset after getting the update?   If not you should always do that as a general rule.   




 GSAM and Wakelock are better.  Wakelock is nice to find out facebook keeps turning on the damn screen. 




 So what? We just blink out of existence?  

I don't find these endings at all scary.  Its not like it would be painful.   You wouldn't even know it happened.  




 I use this phone on the go.  I don't have 30 minutes to stand around.  

I also need to swap SD cards out depending on the site and project I am working on.   This phone was made for productivity and business support... that's exactly how I use it.  

Edit: If I wanted an S6... i would have bought the goddamn financial failure S6 line.    




 Fast charging will never be as fast as a battery swap.   




 Its probably a pimple.  You'll get a lot of those.  It'll hurt maybe but it will go away.  

Don't pick at it or you could make it look like a cold sore.
