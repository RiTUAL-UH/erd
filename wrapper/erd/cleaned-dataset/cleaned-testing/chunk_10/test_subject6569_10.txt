 Good point! I've never even though of that. 




 Unless of course they die from embarrassment first... 




 \*shrug* That wasn't an issue in my experience. It's like a mutual pact of non-aggression. I'd imagine most teens are insecure about their dicks at some point in their development, seeing that you're not the only 14 year old not packing an 8-inch porn star dick might even be helpful...

 




 Have they been on screen together in anything else besides True Detective? Really enjoyed their chemistry as well! 




 That's just... Could you vilify the human anatomy any more?! Imagine doing competitive swim meets in t-shirts... That shit would slow you down like crazy!

My friend told the fellow students that in Estonia (I belive in most of Europe) it is MANDATORY to wash yourself before jumping in the pool WITHOUT any clothes on.

That's true in Switzerland, my country.


She also told them how we use the sauna. Everybody is naked. When there are men and women together in the sauna, usually they wrap towels around.

You sauna naked here as well, even in mixed saunas, though a minority of people do wrap a towel around their body. Never a swim suit though. I've never actually seen someone leer at someone in a sauna (though I've occasionally been in situations where I really had to work to keep myself from staring. Swiss girls are quite fit!)

  Not clothes, bathing suits, swim trunks, speedos,

Yeah, sorry, that was a bit unclear. I didn't mean shirts and pants, but articles like swimming trunks. It's just that the notion of wearing *anything* in the shower is foreign to me. But I guess it's mostly habit. So how do you wash your naughty bits? Just pop 'em out real quick? I'd imagine you'd have to find some way to do it, since showering without washing your ass/genitals would sort of defeat the point, no?

  High schoolers don't shower after gym class

I don't mean to be a dick, but... Ew. 









 I'm genuinely pleased if someone gives me a nice pair of socks as a gift. Good socks make all the difference!

On the flip side, I'm still waiting for all that "have a couple of beers and be hungover for the next two days" nonsense.  




 Yeah. I'm so confused. Are there really people who shower with clothes on?!

A related question just popped into my head: Don't American high schoolers shower naked in communal showers after gym class? 




 I have a few:

* Parks and Recreation
* 30 Rock
* Better off Ted
* Trailer Park Boys
* Scrubs
* Community

I've had periods in my life where I had difficulties falling asleep. I'd often pick from one of these shows, make a playlist with a few of their episodes, program a shutdown timer, and fall asleep listening to the show. Very comforting. 




 Incest. 




 If you read the article you'd understand the use of the word 'loser'. They're literally (in its proper use) losers.

EDIT:

Your comment below this seems to have been deleted, so I'll add my reply to it here:

I had this page open for quite some time before posting, thus your edits weren't visible for me when I posted, apologies. 

Let me address your points now:

It just says "players that tended to do poorly were insulting women more." Okay, there's a good chance they were insulting men more too.

I'll quote directly from the study:

While playing with male teammates, men generally follow rules associated with navigating hierarchies. Skill did not moderate focal player positivity towards a male-voiced teammate, but higher skilled individuals were less negative. **In addition, when performing poorly, players increased the number of positive and neutral statements** (Table 1), **and were generally less negative towards a male-voiced teammate**(Fig 3). As decreased cooperation or behaviours that lead to failure are often punished by teammates [35,36], the increase of positive and neutral statements and relatively less-frequent use of negative statements **suggests poor-performing, lower-skilled males are demonstrating submissive behaviour towards a male-voiced teammate.**

Males behaved in the opposite manner when playing with a female-voiced teammate. Overall, the female-voiced manipulation experienced a greater frequency of negative comments, but female-directed negativity decreased as focal-player performance improved (Fig 3). **In addition, focal-player skill further moderated player behaviour with the lowest-skilled males behaving less positively towards a female voice.** Focal players also increased the use of positive statements as their skill increased (Figs 1   2). Taken together, these results suggest that it is lower-skilled poorer-performing males that are significantly more hostile towards females, and higher-skilled focal players are more supportive.

No, players that performed poorly were not insulting to their male team mates, quite the opposite: their comments towards their male team mates became more positive.

 Females on Xbox seem like an easy target, as do little kids.

Well, the point of the study was that aggression increased towards (apparently) female gamers who were doing better than them. While I don't disagree with your statement that females are often seen as "easy targets" in the world of online gaming, this specific phenomenon seems to have more to do with the fact that these gamers couldn't handle it when they were outperformed by women, when at the same time they weren't behaving aggressively towards men who outperformed them. 




 Maybe you should read the article or, better yet, the research. What the researchers found is that men who performed poorly in the game lashed out at women, **but not at men**. That's why this article is about "a sex thing", because it was a variable that predicted behavior. Get it? 




 So what I'm reading here is that the "prankster", Lee Nelson is a professional attention whore? I wonder what goes on in the heads of those kinds of people...

Not that Sepp Blatter doesn't deserve to be humiliated, but I find people who glom on to public outrage for their own benefits pathetic.  




 Nice! Too bad it didn't feature the two "controversial" verses of the song. 

Was a high wall there that tried to stop me

A sign was painted said: Private Property,

But on the back side it didn't say nothing


This land was made for you and me

.
In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people, 

By the relief office I seen my people; 

As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking 

Is this land made for you and me?

Woody Guthrie wrote this song as an answer to "God Bless America", a song he deemed mindlessly ideological. The irony of course is that when "This Land Is Your Land" became a famous and beloved folk anthem, it was without the two controversial verses, so it lost its overt communist message.  




 Lisa Kudrow delivered all of her lines beautifully. Her brick joke was fantastic! 









 He might. Or he might prefer a quick out. Either way, what he wants shouldn't matter one bit in this process. 




 That's actually smart campaigning. She's so established as the frontrunner for the democratic nomination that right now that interviews and other potentially controversial media exposure can only hurt her. Her name-recognition nation-wide is off the charts, probably several times as much as all of her opponents put together.

Her campaign is laying low right now. Sanders is getting some exposure in the media now, which it's probably going to intensify in the next couple of months (summer is a sluggish time for news media) but, as it stands now, the exposure will reach a peak (as will  his polling numbers) and start to die down at the end of summer unless Sanders' campaign can reach demographics beyond 18-30 year old white people. Because how many times can you write about 18-30 year old white people attending rallies before it stops being a news story?

Until Sanders starts to drastically poll better with the elderly, with minorities, and with middle-age moderates, Hillary does not have to engage at all. She can bring it home on name recognition alone. Acknowledging her opponents would be akin to knighting them, giving them more exposure.  

Is it cynical? Sure. But it's also smart campaigning. Right now Hillary has nothing to gain, but everything to lose by drawing focus.
