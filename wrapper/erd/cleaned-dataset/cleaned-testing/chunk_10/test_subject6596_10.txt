 I like the color theme. I find it really similar to my diarrhea, which makes it personally touching. You have piece of me on your desktop.  




 This is wrong in so many levels. Please, use Vim instead.

 Well isnt everything okey then? People didint have power before and they dont have it now either. 




 So somebody lied to them? 




 Oh. So why did they vote? 




 I so damn confused about this Greek democracy. When they vote NO it actually means YES? 




 Jos ny totta puhutaan ni kyllhn tm oli vhn Kreikan demokratian kuolema. En yhtn ihmettele jos siell on ihmiset barrikaadeilla tnn. 




 LOL 




 Yeah there is no right wing party running goverment, it is EU running your goverment. :D 




 I am very disapointed to this agreement. There was nothing about fridge magnets. 




 They slow at making riots too? You need to learn effiency. 




 I am quite suprised if there is no riot in Greek today. 




 Current measures are your own fault. You had better options earlier. Instead you wanted to act like squaky kid. Are you aware your tax poliicies are like kids play compared to ours? Are aware we dont have holidays like you have? Are aware our pension system is nothing like yours? We dont have those advantages as people. We work hard, we pay lot and we dont complain. We pay our debts. We dont cry and demand other countries to come and save us. And we are also in deep depression, we lost jobs and do financial cuts ourself without nobody DEMANDING us. Last week there was huge mass layoff in microsoft. We lost 2000 jobs with single hit. We have pretty much lost over 10k+ job only in Nokia. Yes we dont have our crown gem Nokia anymore. But you see us crying? We are stand and we do our best. Begging is not pride for us, it is shame. Pride is when you stand behind your words and go forward without complains. And we have word for it, it is called SISU. 




 You understand we are in deep depression and we are doing huge financial cuts ourselfs? and we are doing them volunteery without anybody demanding us, because that is what responsible country does. 




 This is what Greek needs. There is lot to learn from partner like Russia. Definetly right direction for country like Greek. I am sure Putin will help uproot the corruption. 




 Merkel needs to add Greek fridge magnets in proposal! 




 Tits. 




 And btw, your country population is twice the size of ours. Our budget is 50miljard per year and our support to Greek was 7miljard that is 14%. That is from country that is in deep depression, I would be fucking grateful. 




 Well we will see if you deliver, https://twitter.com/tarapalmeri/status/620262473476763649/photo/1 




 Well what I understood from you talk is that you dont trust your own goverment, why should we? 




 Isnt it obvious? Trust. 




  our politicans aren't so dear either.

Dear? We voted parties to cut our financials. We made that decisions as voters. We wanted them to cut our social support so we can cut our debt. You see the difference? 




 You dont get? You are talking shit about our representives, who we voted and who promotes our intrest. Do you understand situation we are in? We are in depression, people are losing jobs, we need to do financial cuts and same time we should support you? Our people are against it. We voted people in our parlament and biggest support went to parties that are against Greek. And now our FM is doing what we told him to do, stopping Greek money. 




 Are you aware you are talking about OUR POLITICIANS. You are talking about OUR PEOPLE. You are talking about people WE VOTED. You are talking about our beloved Stubb and Merkel. They are OUR REPRESENTIVES. 




  Our people dont get the money, the banks do and here is a game of them and the politiancs.

Maybe you should fix your corrupted goverment then? German, Fins and others live in countries with democracy and transparency. Our politicians do exactly what we say and when we dont like them we vote them out. It is not our fault you have such system. It is not our fault you dont change things there. It is not either our responsibility fix your problems for you. We spend money on you already and you didint deliver what you promised. Why would we give you more money? So you could fuck us in the ass again? 




 There dies thousands of people in African every day. Why would I give my money to Greek instead them? Stop the "stop playing with lives" bs. 




 Can you translate that for me? 




 Stop crying, it is your own goverment that did this. It is time look in to mirror. It is not our job to feed your people.

EDIT: And btw Putin is helping you, you should be happy. He will help you with corruption and transparency. 




 I love Merkel more every day, such lady, such balls. 




 I am quite disapointed, I could not find any hate from comments :'( 




  Suomessa rettmn varakas ja vaikutusvaltainen ruotsinkielinen kansanosa, jolla voi olla taskussa muutama nyittv narunptk.

Tmhn on jo yksin tysin ptev syy luopua pakkoruotsista.

 harva puolue uskaltaa sanoa pahasti monituhatpiselle ruotsinkielenopettajajoukolle

Onko kukaan koskaan tehnyt tutkimusta siit ett millainen yhteys ruotsin kielen opettajilla on suomen ruotsikieliseen vestn. Ja onko nm kyseiset typaikat suomenruotsalaisten suojatypaikkoja?

 Myskin pikkupitjien vki jisi auttamatta rahasyist englannin varaan.

Nin pikkukaupungin ihmisen se ei vlttmtt olisi mitenkn pahasta.

 Ei nyt helvetti luovuta yhdenvertaisista mahdollisuuksista.

Nisthn on jo luovuttu aikoja sitten. Ihan vain nin esimerkkin voidaan pit isojen kaupunkien lukiota.

 Jos asia valmistellaan hyvin ja rahaa on, kannatan "pakkoruotsin" korvaamisen "muulla pakkokielell kuin englannilla".

Ehdottomasti, ohjelmointikielet voisi olla paras valinta ;D
 




 This is hilarious as fuck, thank you. 




 Kyl niilt viel bisnes ly tuntuu lytyvn :3 




 Paska tuote on paska. 




 Miksi pitisi tarjota pakollisena mitn muuta kuin englantia? Ja kuka sano ett suomen pit vkisin pit kiinni kielten opettajien typaikoista? 

 Kaikki kieltenopiskelu lis lykkyytt ja avartaa nkemyst. Jos asiaa katsoo mustavalkoisesti niin mieluummin pakkoruotsi kuin laskeva kansan sivistystaso.

Tai mielummin ei pakkoruotsia ja nouseva sivistystaso. Jos mietitn mit voisi opiskella sen sijaan ett opiskelee pakkoruotsia. Olisi se sitten toinen kieli tai matematiikka niin sill saadaan huomattavasti parempia tuloksia aikaan kun opiskelu perustuu vapaaehtoisuuteen ja omiin mielenkiinnon kohteisiin. 




 Sorry don't really get your point here. I meant EU as "top" and user as "bottom". Where EU cant really effect the "cyber security" of inviduals. Because, what ever the systems are the user is always the weakest link. 




 Talking about "cyber security" general. It is not something you force from top to bottom. It is something you build from bottom to top. Nothing help as long as stupid user is stupid. 




 But some reason I think that dude in wallpaper is doing something dirty behind that terminal. 




 Kiitos erittin rakentavasta kommentista. 




 Oops, didint notice it, though it looked like that because noscript :P 




 Concept is also quite stupid. How could something like European "cyber security" effect the security at personal level. 




 It is because right wing left, because they didint want to stay under Ellen Pao. But unlike right wing, left wing likes to stay under dictator. 




  It pains me to say this, as a pro-European

I think it is more pro-European to let Greek exit. Greeks gets money and problem is moved forward few years. What then? We we put in more money? Markets are already full of EU money and they are acting wierd. All the money is already floating the market and it dont react because they expect EU to pump more money. We should have let the Greek crash in the begin. Now we just rescued people who took Greek risk first place and paid it with tax payers money. Who is going to save tax payers money? 




 Onnistuuko kielikurssien suorittaminen ristiin? 




 It is like we are blowing one big balloon which will blow up eventually, it is just better to let it explode now. 




 I am not really complaining about anything. I am just pointing out somebody like Trispas is not trustworthy. What comes to my prefered outcome, it is Greek exit. 




  He has no other choise.

Well I took that as you agreed what I said about Trispas. So basicly you accept his actions, which I think you accept misleading people is okey as long as it promotes your own intrests.

And seriously? Racist card? Lets try to act civil in here, we are not greeks after all. 




 Otan osaa. Yrit kuitenkin saada se pois alta mahdollisimman nopeasti ja viel kun on jotain muistissa. 




 So lying and misleading is okey as long as it promotes your own intrests? I think this is the fundemenal problem you have. And also the reason you guys should not be trusted. 




 Kovasti leikataan opetuksesta mutta samalla sen kaikista turhinta ja tarpeetonta osa-aluetta kasvatetaan. 




 Kenellekkn tullut koskaan mieleen ett ruotsin kielen opiskelu voisi olla taakka? Ja ett se voi jopa hidastaa opiskelua. Esimerkiksi itse olen kokenut ruotsin opiskelun erittin raskaaksi. Ensiksi ei vain ollut motivaatiota opiskella koska koin ruotsin opiskelun tysin turhana ja tarpeettomana. Se taas johti siihen ett ruotsin osaamiseni oli erittin huonoa ja meinasin saada ehdot. Siit lhtien siihen on trmnnyt niin lukiossa kuin yliopistossa. Ja voin sanoa ett siit krsii kaikki muu opiskelu kun kielen opiskelu vie satoja tunteja ylimrst aikaa. Puhumattakaan siit ett meinaa jd peruskoulun paperit saamatta tai tuskasena yritt pst ruotsin kursseja lpi ett saisi paperit pihalle lukiosta. Mit enemmn sit joutuu vkisin opiskelemaan sit enemmn sit oppii vihaamaan. 









 Why would anybody trust Trispas. He is doing almost identical proposal as people voted AGAINST. And he is even talking about "people mandat". Seriously? 




 Shitty propaganda. 




 Musa soimaan, alasti ja kopteri kyntiin. Ei hitto et tuntuu hyvlt olla syntinen. 




 Oletko koskaan tutustunut saatanpalvontaan? Tai oletko yliptns tutustunut pelastajaamme ja vapahtajaamme saatanaan luciferiin? Ja haluaisikot mahdollisesti kuulla lis? 




 I demand night mode (voat got one). I also think you guys should steal some ideas from reddit addon extensions (dont want to use 3th party extension without audit). I also like the way Voat looks, maybe because text was more centered (no need to move eyes so much). 




 An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, we want Ellen fired!

EDIT: Nvm, she might sue them :DDD 




 But Voat actually looks lot better and got way more features, why should I come back? There is just more features: night mode, text formating and better statistics. 




 Is it me or is that wallpaper quite gay? 




 - Perunoita
- Pari pakaste pussia
- Jauhelihaa / Nakke
- Pari lihakuutiota 




 Porvareilla muka munat.. h h 




 Nobody never talks about Mao even he was the best killer ever, maybe that was the reason he killed so much.
