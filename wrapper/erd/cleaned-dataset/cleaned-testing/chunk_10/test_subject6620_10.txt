 You could tell he did love being a Hawk and playing at the Stadium. (I'm sure he really didn't miss Keenan or the ownership after leaving)

 Good one! [This is still my favorite.](http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6144/6009777887_d2f88341e5_z.jpg) 




 That's correct. 




 Florida Man has got more cars than Jay Leno 




 That's crazy! A guy in my neighborhood has a yellow one of these I had no idea how rare they are. 




 You're inviting your wife to your "homeymoon?" How do your homies feel about this? 




 Yes. My memory failed me. 




 Yes that's it. The Avs, not the Sharks. 




 Ya don't say. 




 That right? 




 That one was too easy. 

[Here's my favorite from the playoffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8FKbhcILWc index=15 list=PL5Ieao-D3SgZ7pDJ_iIqdYqaQK0P5rFnu) 

Couldn't find one of my favorite Sharp plays though. You guys remember when he stole the puck against the Sharks and sent a home-run pass up the ice for someone to score a breakaway? ...it was like 3 years ago.

Anyway, [here's a fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8FKbhcILWc index=15 list=PL5Ieao-D3SgZ7pDJ_iIqdYqaQK0P5rFnu) against the Blues for good measure. 

I'm going to miss saying "That's a 2 min penalty for being too handsome" so hopefully he heads the the penalty box a few times when we see him next year in green.  




 Alright. Confession time here. Chris Farley died when I was in 4th grade. I told my 5 y/o brother that he got too fat for the earth to support him anymore and he caused the elevator in the John Hancock Center to fall so fast that it burst through the earth's crust, subsequently causing him to be perpetually falling until one day in the future he will break through the Earth again and re-emerge in China.

He believed this for YEARS, and would constantly ask me if he was still falling or if there was a hole in the floor of the Hancock Center that you could "see through the world." 




 Let's give the man a chance before we decide he isn't a good fit for this team. I, myself am very excited to see him play on the 4th line. I watched him quite a bit when he was in town with the Wolves. He is speedy, has good hands, and is Shawzian in his ability to get under people's skin. 

Many of you were flipping out at the thought of Desjardins replacing Ben Smith, and we all seem to be fine with that now. Garbutt possesses more offensive upside than Desi or Smith. 

I predict we'll get about 12-14 goals out of him this season, and while he'll make trips to the penalty box, he and Shaw will be earning us a number of power plays.  




 Dude, Bochenski is absoultely TERRORIZING the AHL. He is going to fit it with guys like Calder and Arnason, I think we might make the playoffs in a few years.  




 Good wishes to your family, sir or madam. While in a different point in my Mazda 3 journey, you've inspired me to write my own ode: (excuse the (no, not Nissan) stanzas for not existing)

Aspirations of high school coolness were put to the test

When I was handed the keys to a Cavalier RS

17 years of Chicago winters have must 

Caused the doors to be completely consumed by rust.

Things looked up in college you see, 

As I saved up enough for a Grand Am GT

With a badge of Ram Air and faux dual-exhaust

I destroyed the power-steering for an $800 cost

Surviving thieves, snow, winds, and ad-vers-ity

The coupe failed safety tests in the state of Vir-Ginny.

Feeling dejected, down, and just out of luck

It was sold in the shithole of Maryland for $4000 bucks!

I used public transit for 2 months or less 

Until I bought a punchless Elantra GLS.

Indeed alloy wheels and privacy glass it had,

But when obliterated by a RX350 I wasnt overwhelmingly sad.

But I enter the Mazda 3, and grabbed the wheel,

I became enthused by its unique steering feel. 

Despite its blue-eyed goofy grin, these 6-speed Mazda 3s 

Are in a class of their own with those MPGs.
 




 The goddamn bankers finally got inside his head! 




 That tree looked to have a turning radius slightly better than the Roadmaster. 




 All that talk about Green   Brown, and I didn't even get to hear Mr. Regular growl the phrase "BOWEL MOVEMENT" once. A bit disheartening. 




 Or maybe he flourishes here. With the likes of Dunc, Seabs,   Hjammer logging the really big minutes, perhaps Daley becomes a much needed specialist on the PP and contributes offense in dazzling bursts.  









 We still have the cap space to sign [Dwight Schrute](https://youtu.be/-4uGBW2Eypo?t=49) for his dream salary. 




 Pretty excited for Daley though; he had 16 goals last year. Seems like a bit of a gamble, but he can do [this](http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=611059) from time to time.  




 So many memories of this guy.

I remember watching him dominate the Wolves in the 2005 Calder Cup finals next to a young Mike Richards   Jeff Carter, and a reprehensible parasite named Jon Sim. 

Then, I remember seeing a short blurb in the back of the Sun Times' sports section saying that the Hawks traded Matt Ellison for Patrick Sharp. Exciting news for a Hawks fan who was chomping at the bit to see the next wave of "stars" like Tony Salmelainen and Pavel Vorobiev. 

Then, many years later in 2011 or 2012, my future wife and I were walking through her neighborhood of North Center, and spotted a very nice yet old fashioned couch in an alley behind a monstrosity of a new home. We decided to take the couch back to her place. I learned shortly later that Sharp had just moved into that house. Soon, the "alley couch" became the "Patrick Sharp couch." 

The rest is a blur right now with the exception of this beauty against the Preds.

 I'd like to help you fix your flair: 

**in the wullllllllllllld.* 




 Classic. According to television, a fictional version of Louis CK drives one of those. You're in elite company, good sir.  




 Perhaps the second best car featured next to the "Skyline with an automatic transmission." 




 The high end Lexus RX. Not because it is a bad car, I'm saying this to discourage more horrible drivers from buying them. If I may channel my inner Clarkson, they seem to be exclusively driven by either the stupidest, worst type of human beings...*in the wullllllld.*  




 There is a guy in my neighborhood who has a red two-door RX2 in enviable condition. He regularly parks it on a busy street outside the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago; it makes me so nervous that the car is passed by hordes of maniacs on a daily basis, but I haven't seen a scratch on it in two years.  




 I believe they are Mazdas. 




 My personal favorite MMP moment was when Bill was screaming at his computer for not loading a news story fast enough, because "he doesn't have that tree that gives you good internet." Then later in the episode he says how he never "lets his computer update, because he wants it to keep running the way it is."  




 Tom Skilling? 









 Lemont is being renamed LeScott. 




 Folkin' Right, Chicago 




 Add this guy to the two owls that I saw banging above the platform of the Mayfair station and you've got half the cast of Winnie the Pooh.   




 Hmm... actually a pretty good deal on snapping turtle. 




 Doc also once said that "Svengoolie shows kiddie films on Saturday nights in Chicago." 

Chicagoans will tell you that this is pure blasphemy. 

Lemont, IL is considered a far south suburb.

 He should know. Over 750 games played, and Milbury is still shy of 50 career goals

 They need to recognize Cadet Kelly first. 




 I've feel the need... the need for STEEG! 




 I'll have a dark and stormy, please. ...wait. Hold the Lightning. 




 Sopel is on Channel 5 right now. Good omen. 




 Please tell me that someone other than Nordstrom is stepping up tonight.  




 Billy Redface better not spend too much time on the road... Looks like Sal the UPS guy is next in line to take his LAYDEEEE. 




 I'm expecting nothing less than an epic series. This Lightning team reminds me a bit of the Hawks at the beginning of this decade. Additionally, with the fire power that both teams have no lead will truly be safe; games will go down to the wire. 

I've been following the Bolts a bit this season, and saw a game at Amalie against the Preds. Despite Pekka stealing that one from you guys, I foresee two great teams firing on all cylinders. 




 D4: The Game 7 Loss 














 I usually have a high-tolerance for spicy foods, but about a year ago I ordered my Lamb Vindaloo "VERY spicy" at Essence of India on Lincoln. I had to excuse myself from the table 2 or 3 times when my sinuses started on fire.  




 You want to come back to our division?  




 I wouldn't recommend that. That's a good way to get an infection.
