 Godlike, 
superheros manifest during WW2 it has a chronology with dates and  events.

The first one was a german flier who Hitler hugged and declared the first Aryan.

  Perfectly normal, perfectly healthy.

aha! 




 I sadly have to agree, it's one of the reasons i am afraid to say i'm a Portuguese player.

I think it's because they still haven't left that "roleplaying-phase" we all had, where the first characters everyone usually made were terrible anime cliches or bland copies of other media.

We all leave that phase but it has to be by our own accord, can't force it and you can't ask your weaboo friends to help you because showing up at a dnd table with Sasuchigo the demon shinigami who's destiny is to save the world and then get mad when people when they try to explain how things work and how they don't.

(this has happened to me some times it does not end well)

i could go on to explain in more detail but i don't wanna fill this thing up without good reason. 




  Perfectly normal, perfectly healthy.

What does that mean? 




 To hit things better, than the others.

Every class can try to do everything but is only an expert at a certain area.
 




 Portugal has a very small community mostly Dnd, pathfinder(Implying it's not dnd) and V:TM.

I have seen one rpg that was made by Portuguese people and it's about children who were commissioned by death to rapture souls of other people in turn for a chance at heaven i believe.
It's darker than it sounds. 




 How does a human turned statistic look like? 




 It would've saved uncle Ben. (i'm sorry)

maybe not as a full-on spandex superhero more of a casual person with a strange ability AND it'd be a great way to get to know people
OOPS the elevator stopped when that special person came in. 




 The weirdest superpowers you would like to have

 and how you would use it.

1 power per post(not person),please. 




 Thnks. 




 I remember the character was a demon who was given to human parents to raise, when he grew up the demons came back to take him, as a teenager he's flung onto a wall by a car leaving the mark of a demon on the wall.

it's an old anime
