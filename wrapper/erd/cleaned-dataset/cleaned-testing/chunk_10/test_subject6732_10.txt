  The Mist

I watched the movie... and hated it, especially because of such a heartbreaking climax. I like Stephen King very much. Will i be able to enjoy the book of the movie that I hated?? 




 Ya it's a splendid work on life. 




 [Not just for every book but for some memorable events and incidents from the series as well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/search?q=years+ago+today restrict_sr=on) 




 Happy Birthday to your son :)))) 




 I finished the book at around 2 AM and today is also my birthday.

Starting with the idea of having a dog as the narrator to the way it sees the mankind, their relationships, their emotions and its own, their lifestyle, the satire, its persona... all these have hit the chord and the book has filled great many places in my heart. I recommend the book to anybody who love to read something sensible about life from time to time.

 




 Hi. i just finished the book last night. It was splendid. Now the book has gotten a forever place in my heart. A 5 star book this year so far. Thank you so very very much. I mean it. 




 I wonder if there will ever be another such book series that would let readers love it so much that its mere release into bookshops stands out as an immortal event in their lives. 




 and Happy Birthday to you too :))) 




 This day is so special to me because it was my 18th birthday, and today it's my 25th. And in 2007, I considered the book release by Rowling as the best birthday gift I ever received. She gave me something I will never forget in the entirety of my life. Thank you, J.K. Rowling :))

**EDIT:** Ok. That was a small math mistake of mine. It was my 17th birthday. I guess I was too excited about my 18th birthday that I added year to the actual 17th. Sorry, my bad :)

And **HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ALL THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE BORN TODAY ALONGSIDE ME, DEAR POTTERHEAD BROTHERS AND SISTERS :)** 




 I would recommend people to read atleast one book about nature and environment each year.  I strongly believe that we should pay attention to the planet's grave perils such as climate change and global warming which are being caused because of us. These problems deserve to be known.

*Walden* by Henry David Thoreau would give you a kick-ass start.. and then there is lot of non-ficiton about the subject. Am currently reading *The Sixth Extinction* by Elizabeth Kolbert. 




 I do it too. I believe many people do so. 




 [*Show, don't tell.*](http://1000wordseveryday.tumblr.com/post/54758529019/writing-advice-by-chuck-palahniuk-in-six) That changed everything for me. 









 Guys, guys, guys... I asked a number of times in this sub if a person who is not at all into gaming can still enjoy *Ready Player One* book. No one replied. Now that the bookclub is reading the books of the same author, can somebody please take a moment to clarify my doubt?? Is *Ready Player One* an enjoyable read to all non-gamers as well? 




 thanks for introducing a new author to me... 




 Can you please draw a person telling stories.. a storyteller. 




 If you're talking of signs and omens, you should really read *The Alchemist* by Paulo Coelho. 









 Do not concentrate on numbers, bro! 




 I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE. TAKING UP SO MANY THINGS, WITH SO MUCH MOVITAION AND SO MANY GOOD IDEAS AND INTENTIONS. BUT AFTER A WHILE I SLOW DOWN, AND SETTLE DOWN ON A MEDIOCRE LEVEL IN ALL OF THEM. I WALK IN THE LIBRARY OF LIFE WITHOUT LOOKING INTO ANY OF ITS BOOKS KEENLY. I'M ASHAMED TO TELL YOU GUYS THAT THERE IS SO SINGLE THING IN MY LIFE TILL NOW THAT I EXCELLED IN. REASON: **MEDIOCRITY**. MY LIFE IS FILLED WITH IT. SHIT. **I FEEL LIKE A FUCKING SHIT, BROTHERS.**

I TOOK UP THE PREPARATION OF AN EXAM THAT I LOST INTEREST TO STUDY. I'M UNABLE TO FUCKING PUT MY MIND TO PRODUCTIVE WORK. IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS THERE IS NO DAMN THING THAT I REMEMBER TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED. THE FUCK. I'M FUCKING HATING MYSELF. 




 Just take one day off from your daily fapping routine and keep yourself off from all the usual thoughts. Do whatever is possible to keep yourself busy and productive for that one day. Meditate. Read. Dance. Sing. Roam. Eat. Paint.. do anything but masturbation, or even spend the whole day dreaming and imagining yourself as the person you want to be in life. Live one day like that. And see if you like it. Ask yourself if you want to experience more of such days... and you know what, you already have the answer. 




 I'm not a gamer. I never had any interest in playing computer games. Is the book still enjoyable for people like me or was it written keeping only gaming readers in mind? 




  I think he's missing something.

The person who hiked to the peak of a great mountain that oversees the unending green blanket of beauty, and if he stands there and tries to calculate the depth of the valley infront of him instead of enjoying the breathtaking view... what do you feel? I pity him. 




 From:

 I used to fap like twice a day and incest was the only thing which gave me the pleasure.

to:

 Now, after reaching nofap, I fap like once in a week or so and I am in total control of it.

That's quite a good change. Many people here might disagree with your new fapping routine, but I completely agree. After all, the purpose of NoFap community is not just helping people get over their fapping addictions, but also helping them do it in a way that they think is best for them. So, you're fine there.

Even I, before I knew of NoFap, used to take long gaps from masturbation whenever I got bored or lost flavour in M sessions. The rarity of the event itself makes it much more enjoyable for me. The titillations that I get, now and then, when I keep myself away from M for a long while, like more than 10 days or so is very pleasurable. And when I do it after such desire and titillation filled arousal, oh it simply is an inexplicable feeling. 


 




  I can tell you biweekly relapses (once every two weeks) aren't the most effective way in tackling NoFap.

Looking at what the OP said in the post, I don't think he is *relapsing*. He is quite clear that he took up NoFap by deciding to fap once in 10 to 20 days, so I think his new fapping schedule need not be counted as relapse. I belive that relapse to this OP means fapping again like he used to do before, very frequently and only to those incest fantasies during all those times. 




 Maybe he is saying that he can't see the beauty of poetry if there is no knowledgable information in it. 




 Yes. I've always wanted to read something in Quantum Ficiton genre.. And this book is quite grand in its QF concepts. So, I'm being satisfied :) 




 **The Amber Spyglass (HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy, book III) , by Philip Pullman** 




  Shut up and take my money.

By the way, where is the money? 




 *"If a man constantly aspires, he is not elevated?"* - Henry David Thoreau. Happy Birthday, sir. (12th July) 




 Yeah I actually *Farenheit 451* very much.. especially the concept... and climax :) 




 Smart. 




  Just use this "storm" to motivate you, to try to make a change in your life.

 I always do Hardmode.. Well, I'm from India, so we can't do anything else. I mean, having a girlfriend and having sex with her before marriage is not a norm here, moreover it is seen as a very indecent thing in most of the households. So, unable to have actual sexual experiences at regular intervals, we tend towards porn. So, if we take up NoFap, it almost always ends up as a Hardmode. 




 I found that eating something while watching porn makes you eat more. Might be good for thin people, thus letting them take in good amount of food. 




 If you've fapped and then reset the count badge on the same day.. technically, it becomes *Day 0*.. So, you got to wait for 24 hours for resetting the badge, because it reads as Day 1. 

Now, come back tomorrow and reset it to Day 1 again. 




 I didn't even know there are such novels.. thanks. 




 He's walking like Daniel Craig from the James Bond movies.... 




 *The Stranger* by Albert Camus... OMG that book :(
and most of all, *Loser* by Peter Ustinov - this book I hated with all my heart. 




 It was so depressing... and boring... and dull.... actually that's how I feel about most of the dystopian novels. 




 *They didn't understand what they were doing.*
I'm afraid that will be on the tombstone of the human race.

 I'm an aspiring huge PKD fan... Yeah. And a couple of years ago, in 2013, I picked up *The Divine Invasion* book, it's the first PKD's work that I read... and I was really disappointed.  




 I love Dan Brown, and his brain child, Robert Langdon.. (and also Tom Hanks playing that character.) 




 This is a good post. 




 **1984.** Sorry, fans, but yes, I do think so. 




 *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* and my life changed afterwards. No kididng. 




 I can't post the free Amazon book link here because Amazon links are banned in the sub, right?

But do check out the book, Nikola Tesla is one of the greatest inventors in the world, and also the most underrated scientist. He sure deserves to be read about.

Thanks :)

Happy Birthday Anniversary, Mr. Tesla :)) 









 Short forms are alright on the internet, but not wrong spellings. And also I'm from India, so we follow British spelling. So, here *Favourite* (with a 'u', like in colour) is our correct version. 




 Keeping a journal to note down dreams is exactly what Christopher Nolan did when he was developing the plot for his *Inception* film. 




 But my case is reverse. The voice says, "You can do Math." But I'm really unable to. Now what, Van Gogh? 




 Then by all means paint well and the voice will be silenced. 




 Thanks for introducing *Accelerando* and its author, *Charles Stross,* into my life just with your single response.  




 That's very informative. Will surely check it out. Thanks. 




  I am so happy I discovered audiobooks and my enjoyment of books.

Audiobooks are kick-ass. They also save you a lot of time. I would suggest you to check out the audio books written and read by Malcolm Gladwell. They're awesome. He's awesome too. 




  I started reading when I was 4!

I envy you from the bottom of my heart. 
[I didn't start reading till I was 16 or 17, and then after starting I didn't take it serisouly till I was 22. Now, I'm an aspiring writer. In the last two years I read 59 books. This year finished 14.] 




  Steven King

Stephen King 




   Steven kings the dark tower series. 

Stephen King's The Dark Tower series. Sorry, Mr. King is my fav author. So, I just had to correct the spelling. 









 Beauty inspires me to write **poetry**. So, here is one for this magificent picture:

**A Breathtaking Sight**

I stood there enchanted

under the umbrella of cosmic light

and witnessed a spectacle undaunted

that showcased the beauty's magic and might.


*"What is it, that sharp light?"*

I asked myself, with a wondering heart

A voice spoke to me from that very sight

and the heavens answered, *" 'tis our master's everlasting art."*

Thank you so very much for sharing the picture, OP. 




 HI BROTHERS.. LONG TIME. HOW ARE Y'ALL??

IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS I'VE BEEN PRETTY FUCKED UP IN MY HEAD. LOT OF OVERWHELMING EXPERIENCES IN MY DAILY LIFE. SOME DEPRESSING AND SOME ENCOURGAING. BUT MOST OF THEM HAVE ENDED UP WINNING IN MAKING ME FEEL LOW EVERY MORNING. 

I DIDN'T LIKE THAT. I'M SCORNING THE FUCKING FEELING OF WAKING UP TO THE MISERABLE THOUGHTS ON LIFE AT EVERY SUNRISE. 

I WANT TO THE CHANGE THE FUCK OUT OF IT. I WANT TO CONCENTRATE MY MIND ON THE INTERESTING ASPECTS OF MY LIFE RATHER THAN ON THE GLOOMY ONES. SO I DECIDED TO LIST OUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT MAKE MY LIFE INTERESTING AND NON-INTERESTING AND THEN SHIFT MY FOCUS ON TO THE GOOD ONES.
 SO HERE IT GOES -

**INTERESTING ONES:**

* READING BOOKS (I LOVE THIS. BUT I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO LOVE THIS SOME MORE)
* READING NON-FICTION BOOKS AND WRITING THEIR SUMMARIES TO BETTER REMEMBER THE STUFF LEARNED (THIS IS A NEW THING I JUST TOOK UP)
* STUDYING MATH  (I WON'T TALK ABOUT THAT)
* WRITING FICTION AND POETRY (THIS IS THE PUREST BLISS OF MY LIFE)
* NOFAP CHALLENGE (NOT AN ADDICT THOUGH, BUT WANTED TO TEST MY MIND'S CONTROL LEVELS AGAIN - LAST TIME DID 131 DAYS IN HARD MODE)
* TRYING TO IMPROVE MY PUBLIC SPEAKING SKILL (THIS IS VITAL FOR SOMETHING I PLANNED FOR MY FUTURE)
* WRITING INFORMAL LOG ENTRIES FOR EACH DAY (INSPIRED FROM THE NOVEL [*THE MARTIAN*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_%28Weir_novel%29) BY ANDY WEIR)
* STUDYING/RESEARCHING ABOUT ENVIRONMENTALISM (CURRENTLY READING A BOOK: [*THE SIXTH EXTINCTION*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sixth_Extinction_%28book%29) BY ELIZABETH KOLBERT, WILL SOON PICK UP A BOOK ON *GLOBAL WARMING* - **BECAUSE FUCK GLOBAL WARMING**)
* ALGORITHMS, MAN. I NEED TO STUDY SOME REALLY IMPORTANT ALGORITHMS IN MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA ANALYTICS

**NON-INTERESTING ONES** (THINGS I'M NOT LIKING IN MYSELF):

* BEHAVING SOMETIMES LIKE A GODDAMN LOSER 
* NOT STICKING TO MY DETERMINED CHANGES IN LIFESTYLE
* **PROCRASTINATION** (MAN THIS IS FUCKING SHIT. THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN FUCKING UP MY LIFE)
* FEARING TO STUDY MATH (YEAH)
* NOT READING MORE NUMBER OF BOOKS (I NEED TO READ MORE, MANY MORE, MANY MANY FUCKING MORE BOOKS IN MY LIFE - *BECAUSE I'M AN ASPIRING WRITER, YO!*)


SO BROTHERS THAT'S ABOUT MY LIFE RIGHT NOW. YOU GUYS TOO PLEASE SHARE YOUR LIFE HERE. **I'M SURE WE CAN INSPIRE ONE ANOTHER. AFTER ALL, WHY ELSE ARE WE HERE ANYWAYS!** 




 This is a beautiful book.. It's the beauty of imagination at one of its simplest forms. This is the first book I read of Neil Gaiman. 




 Oh no no. Not sarcastic at all. That was actually very helpful when you mentioned us to notice the usage of the word "seemed." I totally missed it before. 




 Change the names. Otherwise the book becomes too much alive for those people and, in the long run, to you too. You're still very young, so let's say you've written a memoir using the original names of those people, and later in your life, due to some obvious and unfortunate reasons if the relationship between you and any of those people becomes a bit shaky, then the book might start to carry a lot of different and disappointing aura and meaning around it: when you read those lines again using the original names, and when you know the reality behind it has changed away forever, you will start feeling the void in your own words.  So, it is highly advisable to change the names. This would atleast leave a version of reality untouched forever in the form of the book.

Why I'm telling this is because of a minor personal experience I went through. I had once written something very nice for a person, and at the time the work meant a great deal to me, but later when I faced some opinion mismatches with the person, the kind of sense I had towards my words in that work changed. It started to act as an eternal reminder of what was not. I didn't like it. 




 The best writing advice I ever took was *show, don't tell.*

When writing in first person, maybe we unconsciously end up telling too much rather than showing. Just guard yourself against that one thing, and also by following some other advices from the others comments here you should be very much fine.. All the best :) 




  Notice how to I left out "seemed" in the first example.

That's very insightful. Thanks. 




  "Don't downvote because you disagree".

Well, a lot of people disagree with that saying too. 




  If you don't like it when people disagree with you, don't post anything.

woah bro, am just asking... chill ;) 




  it means something violated reddit etiquette.

I don't think so... This has completely to do with people's personal opinion. If they don't like the post or think its foolish then they downvote. Personally, I only downvote a post (which I rarely do) when it seems to spread negativity through its content. 




 thank you so much for the share... 




 [An essay about the art of writing and the doubt that aspiring writers carry when starting to create that art.](http://fictionwritersreview.com/essay/what-it-takes/) 









  He should lose his job and the President should denounce him and there should probably be some jail time involved too.

Man, no wonder you're downvoted. 




 It really didn't make sense why he was giving a middle finger there, but I'm not offended by it; so I'm fine. 




 The one thing that always sticks with me when talking of this book is the *Chaos Theory* concept and it's execution in the plot. Just a pure brilliance, nothing less. 









  Great movie! Although, the movie is not based on the book. 

Yes, *The Edge of Tomorrow* is undoubtedly a great movie, and yes the movie is not based on *this* book by Asimov. It is based on a Japanese book called [All You Need Is Kill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_You_Need_Is_Kill) by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. 




 Non-fiction books are something of a knowledge repository. Currently I'm reading *The Sixth Extinction* by Elizabeth Kolbert. The book is quite interesting and has some really great things told about some of the species that have gone extinct, the causes behind those extinctions and other such vital data was discussed. 

After reading three chapters into the book, I realized that I'm not able to remember every little detail about the things explained in the book since its beginning. So, I decided to write chapter wise summaries in a Word document. 

I would just like to know about how do you guys keep track of the things that a book teaches you? Once time passes by humans tend to forget a lot of stuff, so how do we take care of such data loss from our minds, data that we collected by doing the hard work of reading many great books?
 




  How technical do you find it to be?

It's not particularly technical at all. I would say somewhere around 1 on the scale of 5. The book has won Pulitzer Prize for Best Non-Fiction, so it is assumed that the book was written for the general lay public, like you and me. Do try picking it up, it's quite a interesting and worthy read. 




 Reddit sometimes tests you in strange ways, you know.  




 AND it's gonna be a heyday! 
*Good luck.* (please read that last part in Liam Neeson's voice from *Taken 3*). 




 I like your optimistic thinking. 



















  - neil gaiman

I just Ctrl+F'd just to see his name being mentioned here. I love Neil and his fantastic story thinking mind. I recently bought Fragile Things and it is a good sign to see its name here. I've only read his *The Ocean at the End of the Lane* which I absolutely loved.

And the first thing I ever read that's written by Neil Gaiman, and which in turn made me fall in love with him, was [this writing advice post on his Tumblr.](http://neil-gaiman.tumblr.com/post/107713982316/i-have-been-trying-to-write-for-a-while-now-i) That's just a pure and fantastic genius of a mind he is. I mean, who the hell comes up with something so beautiful... 




 Thanks.. I'm a budding Mr. King's fan.. I've read his *Hearts In Atlantis* - although it is not a 'short' story collection in any manner (but a collection of 3 novells) I absolutely loved the writing of Stephen King. Carrie is awesome too. 




 As an aspiring writer I realized that writing short stories would be an invaluable practice for the skill. So, I decided to read very many number of short stories. And I'm yet to come across a book that *absolutely blows me away*.

But I love *Grimm's Fairy Tales* - thay actaully absolutely blew me away. 




 **The Sixth Extinction, by Elizabeth Kolbert**

I picked it up after seeing it recommended by Bill Gates on his [gatesnotes](http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Sixth-Extinction) blog. Also, recently, moved by hundreds of deaths that are caused due to the overheat in my country's (India) climate, I've taken up an interest in studying the perils humans are causing to the environment. This book is quite interesting and captivating in talking of the extinctions that happend in the evolution of the Earth. 




 Like I mentioned, last year I took up the challenge and lasted 131 days. I'm taking it up again now - not because I'm a PMO addict (I'm not. I believe I'm not an addict because I fap only like once of twice a week) - but because I want to wake up my mind from rest and laziness and put it to the test of productiveness.

(Also, I love those erections that I get after not fapping for a long while... those tempting titillations are sometimes better than having an orgasm - and such *long while*s are possible only through NoFap challenge.) 

Let's see where this tour goes :) 




  stronger than yesterday, weaker than tomorrow!

I liked it.. This should be adopted as /r/Nofap's slogan of the sub. 




  but I went on a hike instead

*Into the wild*, bro.. 




 I liked your logic. 




  definitely in the top ten longest books

Easily, very easily in the top ten longest books ever written, too, I'm sure. 




  926

this book is that many pages looooong??? :O 




 **TD;LR of TD;LR:** We all are simply something called the universe juice flowing out of its own glass and into itself, and also 'love' is the single flavour that this juice is available in.

(Seriously, I think the title of this post should've been 'Universe Juice'.) 




 Somebody just shaved it. 




 Yeah, too much description has always been off putting for me as well. Whenever I read the books that have pages and pages to describe a structure or a building or a room, I just get bored of taking them all into my mind. I like the descriptions of emotions, much like in the *show, don't tell* concept of writers.. but showing too much of a scene's background setting just takes away the fun from the story with its detours. 




 Looks like I'll have to read the book and find out the answer by myself. 




  Joseph Campbell

He is awesome. 




 I didn't know that the founder of Church of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard held a Guinness Record for the number of books he wrote (more than a 1000 books). In the documentary Going Clear, they've told about how he tortured his wife and the kind of financial views with which started the new religion of Scientology, and also his stature, arrogance and demeanour while giving interviews or while on the ship with other members of the church and many, many other such instances repelled me very badly. 

I wasn't least bit impressed that he was a prolific writer of so many books because of how the Church of Scientology turned out in the lives of a large number of its past members, who were physically and psychologically abused to great degrees, and  tortured by punishments such as licking the bathrooms with their tongue, throwing a person on the floor and kicking him cruelly in the name of teaching lessons for their wrong doings against the teachings of the church... and also how they tell the members to completely disconnect from their family members who do not believe in the church... all of this has just gave me a very negative opinion on LRH and his church of scientology.

What do you guys think about this entire concept and how the church of scientology treats people who seem to be future threats to the church's reputation?
 




 that was pretty cool.. thanks. 




  The same with going to the gym. Or researching into an area that I was interested in. Or taking up a new hobby. All of my good intentions were muddied by this persistent cynical belief that I wouldn't get around to it. 

Reading this felt like I was looking at myself in the mirror. 




 *Light can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.* -Albus Dumbledore

You know what I mean, right? (Go, patch up with them again bro. Don't let the friendship go.) 




 The speciality of this book in the Robert Langdon series of books by Dan Brown is that this particular one doesn't touch the religion at all. 




 take a break in life and do something altogether different to your current lifestyle ... travel to a place you've never been to before... just get yourself out of the present mindset and explore how many other people around the world live their lives (not writers, somebody else).. and then try reading poetry written about their lifestyles... see the impalpable things, experience them... this would give you a new perspective of anything in life... Watch this Hindi film from Bollywood [Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1562872/) which means *Life Doesn't Happen Twice.* It has some great pure bits of poetry on some really inconceivable things in life.. Be sure to download the English Subtitled version. Just start by watching this movie and see what effect it might have on you. All the best :))) 









 Yeah, that guy needed to go deeper. So he had to link him the link that this post is linked to. 




  God damn it, I'll show those mother fucking investigators.

So he still wanted to kill himself?  




 'save'd 









 And the guy looks like he is from India. 




 Why is this post NSFW? I don't see why. 




 oh BOYHOOD was a really cool film 









 Is that a rule? I mean, is it not a quote when somebody puts in words the precious thoughts they have in just sentences without having to write an entire paragraph or a complete literary work? 









 that shit was pretty deep. 




 IMO when the whole region is governed by one man, it's all the same country for us Indians 




 I never understood why cars have those black panels. 




 What I don't understand is why is this post made in /r/funny. 









 I take a break and try reading completely different stuff to that of I've written earlier. This helps me tell myself that there is lot to do in writing than just writing one thing once. 

Try identifying the genre of the story you wrote then and read some well known books in that genre. This helps you to think beyond your story and it will give you new perceptions and points of views.  




 It would be a cool thing to title the novel as **Present Tense**. No, seriously. 




 Yes. 




 Yes. flash fiction is something that really helps me. Also it is true that the stories that started off as small pieces turn themselves into full length stories. 

If you don't mind me asking, can you please PM me your flash fiction blog? I would like to check it out and take whatever help from it.

Thanks :) 




 Hey man, that's a pretty awesome practice. Let me see if I can take it and implement it in my practices. Thanks, man :)
