 My joke was about your name. I upvoted both of your comments. 




 His name looked familiar to me. That's probably where I saw it. 




 I think your aim needs improvement lol 




 Most likely because kids don't get them. 




 That's American Sign Launguage for I Love You. Pinkie is I, pointer/thumb is L for Love, and pinkie/thumb is Y for You. 




 I'm not even pregnant and sometimes I whisper to my eggs that I love the babies some of them will become. I don't know if that's a baby crazy thing or a maternal type thing.  




 My wife deals with that. Her mom doesn't say it after phone calls or when we leave or anything. We both just get a "bye" and her dad is just as bad. In turn, we make a point of praising her sisters (15, 15,   14) and telling them we love them all the time, so they hear it from someone. 




 I'd argue that it's more unfair for him to have sex with her when she doesn't want than for her to not to when he does. 














 Thank you for the encouragement. I'm actually weird with the whole therapy thing; I've wanted to go since I was 14 and now, at 20, I have my own insurance and no one to stop me. I'm so happy to be going but nervous for the actual going. 




 I have a panic disorder and I'm triggered for it in some really odd situations. One of my things is that I fear people disliking me. I don't like the phone and I don't like private, one-on-one until I know someone. Its not like panic attack level, just a little worried she will decide not to like me or something. I know its irrational. 




 I need to pee so bad but I don't know where the bathroom is inside and I don't know if any nearby businesses will let me use them. So I'm anxious.

I tried to sit for an hour before and drink coffee in Dunkin Donuts, but a stranger literally just sat down with me. I had to leave.

I feel creepy but I didn't want to be late, so here I sit for an awkward length of time.

This is My first therapy appointment since my assessment, which my wife came to. I'm nervous about being alone with my therapist.

Its really hot in My car because it's raining and I have no gas to use the AC with. 




 My wife has no recollection of assault, though I have my suspicions, and cries at the site of a penis. She is horribly triggered that way  




 That's probably because straight people use butch as an insult. As a boidyke (softer, younger butch) call me butch all day erryday. I upvoted to help combat the awful downvotes. 




 Do you realize that most of that isn't necessary?



four sets of braces - who says their kids want them or need them?

music lessons - see above

tutors, sports team fees, gymnastic class, dance recitals - see above.

pediatrician co-pays - maybe they have great insurance

babysitters, vacations, the minivan, the driving lessons, the teenage car insurance rate hike - not needed, wants. 

four SAT prep courses, four college educations - not needed. Scholarships, grants, etc exist as does saving through summer jobs and kids who want trade school.


 




 If she had said she was infertile, she covered it, assuming she was post OP. He didn't really need to know that her body used to be male. However, no sex for 3 years makes me think she was pre OP. 




 No worries! People who aren't lesbians aren't really aware of lesbian groups/labels. There is no reason to be aware lol.  




 I love from My Life this section.


They will tell you you can't sleep alone

In a strange place

Then they'll tell you you can't sleep

With somebody else

Ah, but sooner or later you sleep

In your own space

Either way it's okay

You wake up with yourself
 




 Exactly. Butch is about identity and presentation, just like femme is. Any girl, no matter how pretty, can be femme or butch, it's up to her and who she is inside. 




 People don't pick their own features. I'm 20 but I look like I'm 12 mist of the time because I'm baby faced. You don't have to look like Big Boo to be butch lol.  




 Would it really help to have this person in prison and his life ruined if he didnt know she didn't want to have sex?

If you're not 100% sure, it's not consent.


 




 Please enlighten us about *how* this post is "ignorant bullshit". 




 She's totally butch! Not stone butch, but certainly more butch than boi dyke.

Source- am boi dyke. 




 I'm gay and don't see the appeal of her. Everyone else is like enamoured but I'm just... Not. 




 I was completely under the impression that this was common knowledge. 




 I was indicating that we weren't religious as many if not most religious groups reject gays and lesbians. My wife was Theodish which is a form of Paganism but mostly is just spiritual now and I am confirmed United Methodist but have only attended church a small handful of times in the last five years. 




 We're lesbians. We want children and we want them sooner rather than later. 




 Except you can reverse  image search. 




 I have six ear piercings, but all lobe. I didn't get the first set until I was 13. 




 Happy to hear it! 




 I'm 20 and my wife and I are planning on trying either this fall or next, dependent upon money and such situations. 




 I watched an Isis graduate on Friday. 




 You forget that they are all pretty much the same people. 




 You sound like my mom lol 




 I hate Alex and Piper together. They are both assholes and need to fuck off. But that scene was wonderful. 




 My wife has one. Every other lesbian I know has at least one. Every picture of lesbians they have tattoos. I'm over here all afraid of needles and shit. 




 Yes! You've admitted to going to therapy before so tell hi. You're nervous about the group dynamic. 




 In your brain, you have a "map" of your body. It's the reason you can touch your nose without a mirror and why you can wipe your ass without missing a bunch of times first. This map tells you where all of your parts are. For transpeople, their map tells them that they have parts they don't and don't have parts they do. For instance, many transmen have a "phantom penis", extremely similar to phantom limp syndrome. Their brain map says that it's there, so, even though it physically isn't, they can sense it. 

Gender identity is solid, and inherent. It cannot be learned or learned away. In a case of a set of twin boys, one received a botched circumcision, so the parents chose to have him Go through sex reassignment surgery as an infant. As an adult, he transitioned back to being male, despite being raised as and told he was a girl. 

The only proven treatment for Gender Identity Disorder is transition. As I said before, gender identity can't be learned away. There is a really high suicide rate for transgender people; they face massive amounts of discrimination, are very often disowned, poor, homeless, and especially for transgender women of color, live in constant fear of being murdered. Once a person has transitioned enough for them (it varies due to cost and outlook of surgeries for what a transperson may want out of transition) that suicide rate falls. Incidentally, being prevented from transitioning makes it rise, even with counseling.

Now, I don't know if it was intentional, but you cut off the end of my remark on chromosomes being irrelevant. I specified that many intersex people (those are people who are born partially male and partially female either chromosomally or physically in appearance) do not usually stand out as being "in between". They are raised and presented as either boys or girls, most often girls because the surgery is easier and better. That shows that, unless there is a medical problem or a transition, an intersex person can live their entire lives not knowing they were intersex and strangers wouldn't know either. This goes back to gender being assigned at birth but identity being inherent. In resent times, there has been a move away from performing sex reassignment surgery on infants for any reason, including intersexism and botched circumcision because very often, the parents guess the wrong gender identity, leading to force a person into a transition they wouldn't have had to make. 

I'm not sure if you were trolling asking for more information, but if you have any other questions or if anything I said was unclear, please ask. Sorry for any typos, I wrote this on mobile. 




 More like your parents are only now expected to pay for your education, not hers. 




 It's the same company. 




 A half-assed handjob from some color guard skank? 




 It happens a lot. I am 20 and have been with my wife almost 5 years. She will be right there and a doctor will be asking me all about getting the d even after I've introduced her as my wife and stated that women are my chosen form of birth control. I live in a conservative area though, so its probably not the same in New York City or San Francisco. 




 But it's not acting as an ad. It's advocating theft. That's the opposite of an ad. 




 -Che Guevara 




 I get all of that but when I have already stated twice that I have never had sex with a man, I think it's time to let the question go.  




 My wife says that I am all bark and no bite and 100% harmless. She is high femme but wears the pants. 




 Flair time? 




 I can see that side of it. When someone claims pictures of pennies are a trigger because they were poor that's excessive.  




 I have a diagnosed panic disorder and i have triggers because of it. I love thy "misuse" of the word trigger. It draws attention to the existence of triggers and helps create mindfulness.

I'm reading that you can't be arrested for it, but that if you are refusing to even go to the hearing for a suit you can be imprisoned for contempt of court. 




 Hey there chest almost twin! I'm a 40HH so we are only like a hair apart. I have an Underworks 997 and it's effective enough, it just hurts if I wear if for too long. I don't really struggle to get flat enough so you probably won't either r

 Idk about the rest of the world, but in the US public hospitals can't refuse you and the bills can't get you arrested and often disappear from your credit report after a certain length of time. 




 That's really interesting. Thanks for the link! 




 I guess you can take pride in the fact that you pass really really well, but that still sucks and must have caused mucho dysphoria. 




 Girl Code on MTV! 




 We have actually been discussing it and I am working o. Losing weight -blah- to make getting pregnant easier! 




 Maybe you were working bard at bumping uglies to keep that pelvis fractured. 




 I totally get the need to ask. They have to ask anyone with a uterus and that makes sense, but if I tell you outright that I have never interacted with sperm, then let it go. 




 I should have. I was 17 and had no balls though. 




 Aspects of any life are choices and you are making it sound as though I deserve different treatment for being gay. She is not my partner, She is my wife. I have the marriage license to prove it. 




 My wife once had a neckbeardy male doctor argue with her about if she might be "experimenting". It was creepy as hell and she told him like 7 times that she wasn't pregnant and had never been with a man. 




 The childish college behavior is why I, as a liberal college student, work with other liberals over 40. They have the life experience and know how to get shit done. 




 It fascinates me that most people with self-made are liberal and those who inherit the wealth are conservative. Its so opposite of the beliefs. Conservatives think you should keep what you earn when inheriters didn't earn it and liberals think you should share to help all when they did earn it. Its just so interesting to me that that happens. 




 I may have! I'll have to change next time I'm not on mobile! 




 I suppose being in a relationship at all with a woman is a lifestyle choice then. We both know that she wasn't talking about same sex marriage, I just refuse to call my wife something she isn't. She was referring to being gay as it being a lifestyle choice which is not only wrong, but homophobic. No one calls it a "lifestyle choice" when straight people decide to date. 




 lifestyle choices

Imma stop you right there. My love for my wife isn't a "lifestyle choice". Its a small part of my personality and you could use a step back to educate yourself on being so wonderfully tolerant.  









 We are planning to use an anonymous donor but at considering a known donor if it matters. I will carry as she has PCOS and a high risk of miscarriage. Will we have to do second parent adoption or can I just list my wife on our baby's birth certificate? Does it matter if we know the donor or not? We really don't want to deal with a home study and get permission for her to be our child's mother. I can't seem to find any information via Google though, so any help helps.

 Actually, biology and neurology are exactly what make Caitlyn Jenner a woman, just not chromosomes, which aren't really relevant as plenty of people who are intersex are easily read one way or the other. As for Rachel, well race is a social construct, so how one can identify as something that isn't real I don't get, but maybe she identifies with what she stereotypes to be black culture, and I guess that's okay but making up all these bullshit lies isn't. 




 The cruise ship requires you to buy their food and drink, use the entertainment venues, etc. Reddit requires you follow their rules or leave. Not even close to slave labor. 




 We are passengers on a cruise ship; without us, the cruise ship is a big waste of money, but if we don't like the cruise ship, we can use a different cruise line. 




 They've been able to replicate sperm from stem cells in rats for some time now, albeit not with great success in survival. I want to know how eventually transmen and lesbians with be able to offer the other half of DNA and produce a son, since genetic females only have XX and no Y. 




 That is amazing! 




 I don't identify as sapiosexual or anything and I think it's obnoxious to label such things, but intelligence is my number one attraction to people. I doubt it's that common with some the people I know who have relationships. 




 Wait... I did something backward. My wife and I are both slobs and she has a low sex drive. 




 Hopefully this will soon translate to transplants for transmen. (That sentence had a lot of "trans" in it.) 









 Even backwards is too much for me. I'm just going to call and make it clear that I will have a panic attack. I'm going to try having them talk to me, too. That's really great advice. Thank! 




 My wife got it! 

When she was 16, we had just started dating. We are both women.

Her mom: Are you sad that you don't have a boyfriend like your younger sister?

Wife: Nope. I'm good.

Her mom: Is it because you have a girlfriend?

Wife: ...yes.

Her mom: IS IT TRISH?

Wife: ...yes. How did you know that?

Her mom: just be careful. I was bi in high school and you can get... Diseases... From girls too. 




 My mom has really bad health, and for the last three years, every trip to the doctor for her has delivered worse news. I finally have insurance and I should go, but thinking about it gives me anxiety. I think I have hypothyroidism, which my mom has, and I know the best thing is to treat it, but I don't like needles. My depression and possibly the hypothyroidism has made me obese, which I've been since childhood (I'm 20) and thinking about getting on a scale is giving me severe anxiety and I know having no choice would send me into an exhausting panic attack. Can I refuse? Should I explain on the phone first that it's a trigger for my panic attacks? Can I insist on only testing thyroid stuff with blood work? I don't have the energy to deal with anything else and the idea of more is causing me anxiety. I don't know if this is the right place, but I just wanted to know. 




 My top two songs on my phone are Seasons of Love and Take Me or Leave Me. 









 Lesbian here. My wife and I both agree that anything Maia is worth the money. 




 This is really beautifully written, and I'm sorry you suffered through that. Come on over to /r/depression, we have a supportive community and like to listen. 




 Why not take a one year old on a Hawaiian Vacation? 




 It may be different for you, but for me, wallowing in my depression makes it worse. Something I like is to have a playlist of songs that work for me to help bring me up. Maybe give that a shot. 




 You are capable of recognizing that you aren't perfect. 

You aren't below average; just average. That's normal.

You have survived to 23, so you aren't a failure.

Your life is not the lives of those you graduated with.

23 is like 60 years more to make a change.

You know some flaws so you can change them.

You're well articulated.

You're capable of admitting to not understanding. That's a hell of a lot better than most people winging it.

Adulthood isn't having all the answers; it's being willing to look for them.
 




 Thank you so much. I really appreciate the support and you put a really big smile on my face! 




 Thanks for the info! My wife has PCOS and my mom had cervical cancer so I have to get a pap yearly. 




 A lot of gynecological care is cervical, uterine, and ovarian. Yeast infections aren't vagina only, nor are UTIs. When I've had either in the past (faab) I've gone to planned parenthood or to Wal-Mart for treatment. 

If you have female genitals, you need to be getting an annual. You can still get cancer, endometriosis, PCOS, etc.

Edit: at PP for UTIs I just get a prescription after peeing in a cup, no exam. 




 Do transwomen need gynecologic care? I am not really educated about it. 




 So he has no grandparents. 




 Thank you for the words of encouragement! 




 I said I felt other subs should be included. The thing is, those communities don't advocate the level of harassment that fph did. 

An example; Personally, I enjoy r/justneckbeardthings. Recently, the sub has gone from making fun of shitty "le friendzone" behavior to making fun of people's interests, hobbies, and looks. I like when it's about the messages and such, but I unsubbed when it became just cruel. I think that, along with fph and related subs, it should have been taken down.  




 It's bullshit. They don't belong here. 




 I was expecting General Anxiety Disorder. What should I know about this and the differences? 




 I wrote "crick" in a third grade project because of my dad. 









 To be fair, it was self-labeled a hate group. The Westboro Baptist Church is an anti-LGBT hate group. No one would care if they sat around bitching about gay people; people care because they harass gay people. No one would have cared if FPH just sat around bitching. 




 I am liking not working. My mom is very sick and physically disabled and work was the one thing I could cut out reasonably - education is paramount to me, so I'd rather struggle for money than not go to school. My job was contributing for sure. I worked as a companion to a man with Down syndrome and, while it could be rewarding and was like no real work (I actually got paid to go bowling and play in parks) it was stressful to be responsible for him especially when they stopped paying. It has helped, but it's hard to judge as, two weeks after I quit, my mom was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver because of fatty liver disease that we didn't know she had. That's been really hard on me, but I know it would be much harder if I were working on top of it.

I am very extroverted. I love talking to people in person. I just have strong opinions and I'm sort of judgmental. I look forward to meeting new people and I want to help. I am a social work major and I want to work with mentally ill adolescents, so I will be happy to make suggestions. 

I'm very excited about school. I'm switching from community college to a university, and it's a large state school with a massive gay community (I'm butch so since I'm very visible that's important to me) and I'm hoping its a more adult atmosphere than kids screwing off in CC. 

My wife is my rock. She helps with my mom and does anything I need to help me. She is a wonderful person.

I don't feel cursed, lol. The girl's ex told me about it. I have an acquaintance who is weird about stuff like that who gave me some sage to keep in my car "just to be safe" but I don't really think she "cursed" me, at least not in any way that really affects me. 

I will certainly check that book out. I've tried talking on here about building friendships and something I learned that worked (other than the fact that I used it on someone awful) was to act like people are already your friend, and the friendship will built; that even though it's scary, you need to ask people to hang out first. Right now I'm just isolated and having a hard time finding people to build friendships with. 




 Book the next one at your appointment. Tell the counselor that this is what happens and they will help. I hope it gets better. 




 That's my understanding; that we are all similar.

I quit working in part because of my depression and in part because my job stopped depositing my pay. My wife is on board with that decision and works more to pick up the slack so I can work on me. I haven't started group yet but the only people I really talk to are redditors and rarely conversation on Facebook. I have been told that I'm peanut butter and a lot of people are allergic to peanut butter; I don't make friends easily. I had to drop out of college this semester due to family stuff, and I am starting at a New school in August, so I'm hoping I can make friends there, but a year and a half at the first one only got me a Santaria witch that tried to put a curse on me so that wasn't great. 




 I agree! This also rolls over into more scientific advancement, granting transwomen better medical options. It doesn't hurt that transmen have better results with hormones generally and pass and blend easier. It's a multiedged sword. 




 *disclaimer* I'm happy about the ban and think some other subs should have been included.

I think the idea was that the sub was fostering an environment that encouraged that behaviour. I mean it was all about photographing strangers just to make fun of their appearance. It was a really hostile place and I don't know of a better way to have had it handled. 




 It's cool! He's got two dads! 




 Yes they are similar diagnosis. Part of the reason for group is that I have literally no friends offline and obviously that isn't healthy. I appreciate the offer to chat and if I ever need I will take you up on that. Thank you. 




 I play videogames then, particularly open ended games like Runescape or Sims. I don't have to meet a goal and I kill hours. I don't know if that will help you, but I like it. 




 Don't think you don't help her; it probably just hurts that it's long distance. I'd bet a 100 bucks that it's the distance that hurts her, not you. Maybe in a year you guys can close that distance and resume. Try being friends. Without being pushy, tell her that you love her and care and are there for her in any capacity she needs you to be. Show her that you won't leave her that easy; I've noticed that women especially fear abandonment due to depression. (I'm also a woman who has this.)

Also, people can't be fixed without fixing themselves. Trying to fix someone else will never fix you. If you have health insurance or can afford to, seek counseling, even if just for a short time. I don't know the intricacies of your relationship with her, so I'm just going with what I know. Someone else may be able to help you more. 

Don't be afraid to look elsewhere for love. You may surprise yourself, but note that it's hard to love someone else when you don't love yourself, so work on you a bit before jumping right in head first. 




 I'm exhausted. I was super anxious beforehand so now that it's over I'm tired. I sought free counseling out from my college about 9 months ago but it wasn't meant to be long term. I like having the schedule of appointments to go to but actually dealing with my appointments is hard. Its funny, I've wanted therapy for about 6 years and this is my first time as an adult having insurance (with no copay for individual or group!!!!) and I was so excited to start but it is hard. 




 Hairspray or Rock of Ages. I love musicals.  




 What about it hurts you the most? 




 Find something you want to do. Make it simple as smell a flower. It gives you something to look forward to accomplishing and gives you something daily to accomplish, or weekly if that's less overwhelming. 




 I'm going to start saying that now. 




 Lesbian here; my dad loves my wife. When we started dating I got replaced as daddy's little girl; she gets that now.  




 Why not teach them about birth control? 




 Just my two cents; maybe relax that rule a bit for committed, long term relationships, like of a year or more. I started dating my now wife at 15 and we were living together before either of us was 18 because of shit with her family. It would have been awful to wait until we were both 18. 




 Did you have daughters? Did they get condoms or BC pills for Christmas?  




 I'm not saying you are wrong, I just offering another point of view. Feel free to disregard.

Porn: even if you severely limit is ability to get it, he will see it. Its a world of smartphones and WiFi everywhere. Perhaps explain, instead, that porn can quickly become a dangerous addiction. Maybe offer to on-the-sly buy him magazines; they are less hardcore and not the videos that many people are hooked on. If it matters to you, explain that pornography actresses are actresses, they are real women doing not real things. You would never want your wife/mother/sister/etc to be in a situation where she was forced into it; most pornstars are such because of limited options. 

Premarital sex; I actually hope my kids have premarital sex. My mom, before my wife and I ever got married, told both of us to "try on the shoes before you buy them". She and I agree that you should be sexually compatible for the best chance at a strong marriage. We also think you should live with someone first before marriage to make sure you can live together.

Sex in your home: if he is going to have sex, he is going to. By outright disallowing it in your home, you actually put him at risk. If his partner's parents do the same, that leaves public places and a chance at arrests. My parents had an unspoken don't as don't tell policy on sex in their home. 

A big issue with religion in the modern world is that it struggles to line up with it. In a society where tinder is a thing, it's hard to expect a 16 year old kid to remain abstinent. Its hard for that kid to remain abstinent. Try to mold your beliefs around the world, where possible, and offer explanation beyond religion If you want your children to remain Christian. 




 My girlfriend (now wife) and I were 16 and together for six months when we started to have sleepovers. We were supposed to be in different beds but that never happened. We are gay, though, so pregnancy was never really an issue and we were both so young that we were only ever each other's sexual partner so neither were STIs. Because of all that, my parents were lax when my brother, at 16, started seeing his girlfriend. They are still together at 19, so I guess it worked out okay. 









 I don't know; by 5 and a half months, it's kind of be a mother or let someone else be a mother. As you said, there has to be a cutoff and she was after said cutoff and to a point where most people would agree It's far too late to abort. I don't know if it's mentioned in this article, but the CNN story says that the boy lived for an hour before finally passing away. That's wrong, to intentionally do that. I don't think she should receive the death penalty, but she does deserve to be punished; she intentionally ended a viable life. 

Edit: apparently the charge has been dropped. http://www.wcvb.com/health/murder-charge-for-woman-who-took-abortion-pill-questioned/33501262

 16 and 30 are worlds apart. You are old enough to be her father. She is a high school student, you are a professional. You will be a father figure and nothing more.

 Well women are disadvantaged in a lot of ways, and overt sexism against women does exist, but women certainly get some benefits; assumed custody of kids, no speeding tickets, shorter prison sentences, etc. 




 I wanted a garden really bad, for vegetables. But to get it, I had to dig out the spot of the old one and lay chicken wire and bury it all. Then I had to buy and plant plants. It was too overwhelming and I couldn't do it. Now I'm depressed that u don't have my garden. 




 Women get this, too! I was pulled over by a state trooper doing 30 over the speed limit. I got off with a warning. In my state, they could pull my licence for that.
