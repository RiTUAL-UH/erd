 She's always hungry ;_;   




 ahhh. another trustworthy individual to work the mod quene ;) welcome. 




 i'm sorry about that. it tells me the same when posting to 2 different subs that i've never submitted to before and I've almost been here for 4 years ;_; 




 no way to edit the title. You'll have to resubmit.  




 I highly recommend Brotherhood of Shadow: Solomon's Revenge mod too. It's only for the PC tho. and there are some other good ones.  




 try pasting in this: http://tylercreatesworlds.deviantart.com/art/A-Kings-Demise-329384788 




 this links to an album instead of a specific piece of work. did you mean to do that, OP?  




 It might very well be 




  commercial landlord

what properties do you manage or own? 


 bitch and moan- GO. STAY AWAY. Stop breathing my air.


what a fucking dick. you should respect the opinions of others. 


 What I do hate about our system are those fucking machines. Having to stoop down to use an awful UI that takes minutes instead of seconds. And then having to go BACK and put the slip on the dash. 


tells us not to bitch.....then goes on to bitch. yah okay buddy.  




 You going after the 6" darth revan when it's released?

 Please be nice to your fellow redditors. It's a must to continue to participate here.  




 Hit the "Report" button so we as moderators can address the issue appropriately. thank you.  




 i don't think it's HDR. it's some god awful filter tho and really takes away from the natural beauty.  




 floaty island thingys, def why this sub was created.  




 I *could* fix it if only I could get it apart. :( 




  I'm not sure what you're doing here, but it looks a lot like self-promotion. Also, all the art I see is fan art, which we

**Spam Warning issued.**  




 did we? how long ago did this take place?? i went back through the mod logs and couldn't find anything.

 def not a combative thing to ask but you've been on the defensive since you showed up to "pile on". **it's fine.** **it's okay.** there are other subs on reddit that i can post this to (and I have already) and def other places on the internet. reddit is not the *friendly* bastion it wants to perpetuate to the masses. 


god forbid, moderators actually do their job of moderating and *actually moderate.* so what if you had to remove some ugly comments. Guess what: You. just. did. your. job. instead of coming on the scene in the defensive manner as in you did. I'm not even a freaking troll but you treat me as if I'm a cancer upon your fine subreddit. Don't worry I'm not even fighting the removal at this point meaning you do not have to comment back b/c I'm done with this. the other mod did great, you did not. suggesting that i only shared the question to start drama is why i'm mad. and if you could think of another way of stating it in a less combative wording then why didn't you do so already.  




 or does this exist in other 1st world countries? In 2nd and 3rd world countries the families live together for their entire lives. Why is American culture different or I am wrong??  




 or does this exist in other 1st world countries? In 2nd and 3rd world countries the families live together for their entire lives. Why is American culture different or I am wrong?? I want to post it b/c I know from exp. that "we" americans share these same communities with many other english speaking nations and the diversity of the question is absolutely required for an acute answer to my question.  




 removed for that god awful title and for fanning the flames.   




 it's really an honest question b/c my wife and I have always said our kids can live with us their entire lives.  




 i....i...didn't mean to cause any drama. I'm not very active in this sub so forgive me it this question in the way you explained it "would cause drama". In no way was that my intention. i've lived in the south-east of America most of my life so I'm a little self-removed from other cultures.  




  Since you've already said that you were a parent (and it's visible in your wall)

wait.... where??? i'll go and delete it right now if that's the case. my apologies for my super heightened sense of paranoia.  




  You just need to update your post to say that you are a parent


that was teeth gritting. like i said, "i don't want the average redditor to know the personal details of my life". i don't think i'll choose to participate. "we" as moderators sometimes are caught in between a hard place and a rock when upholding the rules of the subs we govern and i understand this and this is just one of those very rare times. thank you for your time and have a good weekend.  




 hello i am. i just don't shout it to the heavens like most parents and b/c i do not want just the average redditor know my personal life. can i pm or send a mod mail pic verifying who I say I am?? I'm a mod for many subreddits and this is mainly the reason i do not want the average redditor to know my personal life. it's truly a sincere question. 


please let me know what i can do to fix this b/c i adamantly wanted an answer :)  









 Your probably right but I'm still trying to gage the community. I had a vision that this sub would cater to "all" art and not be fractured like many other subs on reddit. A place that welcomes all art.  




 don't forget that /r/ImaginaryJedi exists. and exclusively caters to fan art all day long.  




 i need some help getting apart my 3.75 scale talking r2-dr from EP 3. it is seriously glued and constructed too well for me to work on. I could solder or replace and bad connections, problem is I can't get it apart :(  




 god, i hope not. this is same user that collects downvotes and harasses other users occasionally b/c he get's pissed about some fucking lego art or something trivial of that nature. if he doesn't like the direction of the sub then i highly recommend him going and creating his own sub. in my exp. you don't run off good submitters/contributers. good submitters are a mod's wet dream come true. /u/jsk23 plez read over this.
