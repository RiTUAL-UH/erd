 Interesting. Not as bland as I thought it would be. 














 Did it have any gum or comics with it? 



















 Probably scared of Jade Helm. Obama has finally taken over most the southwest, news outlets are refusing to tell anyone though..... :) 




 Looks like fox has corrected their story :) 




 Updated: 12:35 pm, Tue Jul 21, 2015. 

Earlier version said someone was. 



















 Yeah, probably a homeless vet that was once captured and fired by trump because of it :) 










































































 I've tried, but I usually just cat catfish and carp. Not sure what bait to use for metaphors. Do we have a meta subreddit? 




 No, because I don't read my own posts aloud. 




 They must have gay marriage there - because weather is only caused by god and he uses it to punish people for gay sins. Yep, after the scotus decision, and unlike tx/etc, PR amended their laws to reflect the change.

See, all this is so simple when you adopt a conservative view of existence. Allowing gays to serve or marry = droughts, hurricanes, etc. Science is so much easier when you become a super intelligent conservative.
 




 I noticed that too, in the last frame. Sun has also moved. 

What we need is a new reddit, like girlsgonewildmysteries where they post pics and you have to figure out what has been removed, changed, etc - or they give you a list of things to find in the pics. Like, Highlights for Adults. 




 She was going to say more, but then just quit. 




 Republicans need that money for more wars to keep us safe from terror. I know, I know, they said that last two wars - but this time they mean it! They have a new plane they spent our money on to help battle the isis fleet of planes and ships.

I feel safer already. 




 It's the flag of traitors and losers - both then and now. I don't care one way or the other if people want to wave it around and be filled with pride as they do so. Doesn't affect me, but it does give me some amusement :) 




 The climate can't change. It was made by god 6,000 years ago and muh bible says he never changes. This all by Obama who now wants to take all our money after taking all of guns and taking Texas through Jade Helm.

There - I covered the republican side of the issue :) 
























 Because it's stupid. It can affect software you have written or installed. Why do you think this is only for home users? Techs who have worked in the enterprise for years have seen first hand the problems caused by updates (One company I worked for we had to skip an NT update on our core software our reps used wouldn't be able to run on the server).

Give people the option to skip updates - I predict this will lead to headaches, will fail, and as usual microsoft will have to admit they didn't listen to actual users and remove this 'feature'. 














 Or maybe a super villain. If it is a villain we should blame Obama somehow. 












































 Trump is the Kim Kardashian of politicians. He wants to see his face and name in print. I love how the right is lapping it all up and falling for his trolling.

Giving the guy all the press he wants to feed his ego is one thing, seriously thinking he is your best candidate is just sheer idiocy. 




 My apologies, saw your name and a bunch of people who resembled it in the photo. Not the first time I have been wrong :) 




 Sure you didn't? Could have swore you were in the photo they had in article:

;) 









 Interesting. I didn't noah that. 









 Did you paint the tree on the wall yourself? It's nice. And that bag with animals fighting each other is just sending mixed messages to me. Does it mean that you support animals fighting and animal testing? Nice Corset too. 




 Ok, give me a sec.

Umm. Ok. Oh, I was gonna make a gun joke but Obama took all the guns in 2008 - just as conservatives swore to us all he would. You remember that?  




 No, your mom helped. 




 OMG is it another Jade Helm? First Texas was taken over, now this?

This is why I was against the fema camps and Obama taking all the guns (still can't believe he did that after destroying the stock market and spreading ebola).

;) 




 You have to do the assless chaps rain dance and play Village People song - and more rain will come. 




 It's god punishing us for gay marriage! Oh wait. 














 Oh lord, his name doesn't sound white enough. Trump will be out there talking about how this wouldn't have happened if we didn't let immigrants into our country ("My family traveled 5000 miles over land and sea to come here and I'll be damned if I see it overrun with immigrants!" *crowd cheers*)

I'll be glad when this election is over. Won't last that long though cause god is going to kill us for allowing gay marriage.  




 That box on the left. What's in it?? What's in the box?

http://imgur.com/GQL0nYP 




 Now, think about this:
1. We were told Obama would take all our guns. Not try to, or think about it, but that he could and would. Gun sales soared.

2. The right claimed Obama was banning all wood burning stoves. 

3. The right said Obama was banning chores for kids (I still chuckle over that one).

Go back to 2008/2012 and look at all the fear mongering from the conservatives. It was like code red alert end of America we are all gonna die (probably from ebola or isis flying those libyan jets the right swore they stole and would use to crash into buildings here).

It is all the right ever has. Scare people. Why do you think churches talk about the end of the world and hell? Scare people into obedience. It is how the conservative mind works. It doesn't require intelligence or thinking.
 




 Naw, trump just knows weak minded people will follow a leader who tells them they are in danger and so is the country and that by voting for him you are saving America, and are therefore a sort of hero.

It's been this way forever. Always some evil force coming to kill us all, elect me and I will save America. It's like the education system. Politicians have said since the 80's it was broken and they would fix if you elect them. 35 years later and they are still saying it is broken and they will fix it.

It's all BS. Tell people there is a problem, tell them you are the solution. War, terror (didn't we just have a few wars over this), immigrants flooding in by the zillions to rape, murder and steal your jobs (that don't exist, remember, because Obama....so not sure where all the  immigrants are working).

People fall for it all the time - while all the real issues that are harming us are internal and swept under the rug. The people in power use fear like religion, to keep the gullible voting for em. 




 Trump relies on people who don't think but react with emotion. 

He is one of those people who believes that if he just tells you that America is doomed and he can save it that people will vote for him. He knows how to play people.

2 Wars this century and drone strikes across the globe were supposed to make us more safe - now the right wants to go back to war in Iraq and attack Iran. You know, to keep us safe.....

Trump adds in immigration to the mix to add to the fear. More money to spend on borders and troops there, spend more on wars and weapons. All the while people starving and not able to get medical care....well, screw em. Just cause the real things hurting Americans aren't exciting and don't make 'heroes' in epic over powered battles. 




 Will it make you like him and vote for him?

If not, why do you care? Or are you just one of those people who likes to bitch about someone all the time you don't like? 




 Fine. I won't eat at taco bell anymore. 





























 Unless it's a self driving car.

Which brings up the question, will those cars have to pass the same test? 




 I'm thinking about some "in-n-out" ordered up "animal style" now. 


































 Here is the suit - they paid $400 to file it. Bet it will be laughed out of court.

 Wow, this is just plain dumb. Really, is there anyone around stupid enough to believe this? Anyone? 




 Been a long time since I put together models. Make sure you share with us when it is done! Being the nerd I am today I prefer painting miniatures for D D :) but, alas, they are all gone after some moves/breakup/etc. 

Nice pics too, btw :) Good luck on the model! 




 Is that a Jeep Willy's book on your shelf? Do you own one? Helped someone back in the day with restoring one. Love those things. Can you get us some pics of it if you have one? :)

 He can spend all he wants. Not enough stupid people in the US, and we have a lot, to vote for him.

 









 Where are our conservative friends now? I mean - we are giving Israel welfare money basically. Tell em pull themselves up by their bootstraps and work harder.

Oh yeah, I forgot - Jesus told them "Screw the poor, but if you don't support Israel I will curse you" or something like that. So they help Israel because they believe it is a sin not to, and don't help the poor because they believe it is a sin to do so.

I never will understand those people. 









 He does get that we have yet another responsible gun owner out there shooting people doesn't he? Wonder if he will address that. 



















 UPDATE: @CBSEveningNews reports 4 Marines, 1 officer shot in Tennessee.

 Wow - that was just dumb as hell. And what is sad is that so many on the right fit right in with that author.

Damned shame. 




 US doing training exercises like they do. Conservative loons are convinced that Obama is using the military to take over Texas and start a new world order and keep himself in power. 




 *facepalm* - seriously, I get that right wingers hate Obama and make up shit about him a lot, but this is out there even for you folks.

Oh well, Git R Done friends and save 'Murica! *waves flag and thumps bible* 









 It's fine. Long day, teen daughter flying across country alone so was just sitting here watching flight tracker and posting things - helps the time go by :) 




 Copied from the article itself. Nice attempt to smear someone, troll. 




 I'm smart enough to have adblockers and such so I don't see whatever it is you are whining about. 


















































































































 I am hoping we get updates from the fema camps in the area, but wi-fi has been spotty so far from what I have heard. 









 I upvoted your comment, and said an Amen. Where's muh money? 
























 Trump is trolling people hard, and suckers are falling for it. He knows how to use dog whistles to get the rabid bigots to come running waving their flags and bibles.

I love it. 




 He is right.

 When former President George W.

 I thought the objective was to get saddam and his wmds. We got saddam, he didn't have any wmd. I count that as a success - the failure was bush deciding to stick around and try to make Iraq the 51st state. 




 Gotta love Trump - he is leading the idiots on the far right to the promised land. They will salute him, thump their bible, and wave their confederate flag - and then vote for him. All the while living in their own little bubble and thinking they won something.

It's so...well, comical :)
