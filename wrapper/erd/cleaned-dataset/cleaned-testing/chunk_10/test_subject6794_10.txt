 I think you're right about this. It seems like they haven't been together that long, so it's possible they just haven't talked about it until just now. 




 Thanks. I try ;) 




 Him being a virgin who doesn't believe in sex before marriage makes his reaction make a lot more sense.

For someone who was raised in a conservative religious household, sex is often stigmatized. You're taught that sex is bad outside of marriage, and even then it's still something dirty or naughty unless you're trying to have children. Many religious people believe that sex is purely for procreation, and if you find pleasure in sex you're made to feel guilty. You're told you're wrong, broken, and used up. It's very hard for someone raised in this sort of environment to deal with sexuality - even their own. 

It seems like Ken made a lot of assumptions about you, and now that those assumptions turned out to be false he's freaking out. I'm not sure how strongly he feels about premarital sex, but if he were being reasonable about it he would probably think that while he was raised a certain way and has a religious preference that dictates his sexual behavior, not everyone else was raised the way he was and they shouldn't have to meet his standards. 

If he doesn't want to have sex with you unless you get married, that's fine - it's his choice. But if he no longer respects you because he now knows you're not a virgin, that's wrong and not a good foundation for a healthy relationship. 

Hopefully if you give him time and show him some compassion, he'll get over this. But if he just can't get past the fact that you've had sex with other people then he probably isn't worth your time. 




 Well, being 17 and not having any romantic experience isn't really unusual or unheard of, so what you're going through is actually pretty normal. It's okay to feel unsure of yourself and nervous about possibly being with someone, especially as a teen. 

Considering you just went through a really rough period of your life, it's probably a good idea to just take things slow and figure out what you want/need. Parents getting divorced is a huge deal, and maybe you still need time to process that. My parents divorced when I was 17, so I can relate. 

As far as this girl, it seems like the two of you have really hit it off. If you get along well and she's already expressed to other people that she likes you, then you would most likely be able to go out with her if you asked. 

My first suggestion would be for you to ask her if she wants to hang out with just the two of you. It seems like all the times you've been together so far were at social events with larger groups of people, so you should ask her if she wants to just spend time together with you. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, just text or call and say, "hey, do you want to come over this weekend?" You could watch a movie on Netflix, maybe play some video or board games, or just sit around and talk. Keep it simple. 

Having time with just the two of you will help you get to know each other better. Clearly you get along, and getting in a little quality time will probably help both of you feel more relaxed around each other and ease into dating. 




 Ah, okay. I think we're good then. 

I think issues of consent are really important, and definitely should be talked about more, which things like this comic can bring about. But yeah, nothing in life is super black and white and these sorts of conversations need nuance and context to be at all meaningful. 




 Well the way I understood it was that the person in the comic let someone borrow their car once and have permission for that one time, but not for multiple times, and it's wrong to automatically assume that because you borrowed it once that you can borrow it again without permission. My argument was, you can also consent to letting someone borrow your car as much as they want for a week or month - why can't the same thing apply to sex? 

No, merely being "impaired" by alcohol doesn't constitute "unable to consent" under any law, in almost every case it's "incapacitated"

I was under the impression that if you were intoxicated to the point of being over the legal limit to drive that counted as unable to consent. This could just be a misunderstanding or incorrect assumption on my part. But for instance, I'm pretty sure that if you sign a contract while over the legal limit, it's considered invalid because you're too impaired to fully comprehend what you're reading. And I know that a lot of people the rule of thumb that if you're too drunk to drive, you're too drunk for sex. 

I absolutely agree that if someone is drunk to the point of incapacitation they cannot consent, but I also know that there are several steps along the way to that point where you could still give consent (like if you're only slightly buzzed).

It's possible that we're both arguing about something without realizing that's not what the other person is saying. Situations of being black out drunk or unconscious are absolutely, no question you aren't able to consent. I'm not fighting that. 

And some couples absolutely do have an understanding that they're up for being woken up with sex, etc - and this would be rape under current laws.

This is the part I'm hung up on. Because yes, there should be protections in place for situations like that, but I also believe that the legal definition of what constitutes sexual assault or rape and what people actually consent to don't always line up. The couple who has a blanket agreement that waking up to sex is awesome wouldn't consider their partner doing something they want and already gave the other partner permission for rape. And that's what I'm trying to distinguish here. 




 Not necessarily. The comic was making a point that just because someone agrees to one act doesn't mean they automatically agree to continuous acts. It didn't say you can't also agree to continuous acts ahead of time. Although it's still a good idea to check in occasionally. 

Perhaps I should clarify. If you and a spouse have a healthy relationship and you both decide beforehand that you don't mind having sex after a glass or two of wine or a few beers (enough to technically be drunk but still responsive and remember everything) then I don't really see a problem. Lots of couples have some sort of standing agreement where certain sex acts are deemed generally okay whenever (kissing or groping, for instance). They of course still have the right to refuse in the moment, and if their partner doesn't respect that, it's rape. 

For a more concrete example, if my fiance and I had a date, and I told him before hand that I planned on having sex that night, we both got mildly drunk, and then he initiated sex (touching or kissing), at that point if I changed my mind I would say no and he would back off. If I was still up for it, we would then have sex. If both of us are willing at this point to do it, even if we're impaired by alcohol (which would constitute unable to consent with most laws), I don't believe it's rape for him to have sex with me. But we also have built up trust and commutation skills so that we know when the other person is willing or not, regardless of alcohol. And that is dependent on the individual people involved. 

If I at any point felt uncomfortable during this scenario and he pushed me into sex anyway, that would be wrong. But if I plan on having sex, continuously and enthusiastically say yes, still retain most if my facilities, and have no regrets afterward, but it's technically considered nonconsensual according to the law, is it rape? I don't consider myself to have been raped, even though I've been in this situation a few times. And that's why in most cases you also need to have a complainant before you enforce that law. 




 No problem. Happy I could clarify for you 




 Honestly it was just bad wording all around. You probably should have clarified more and said "my girlfriend is afraid other people think she is a whore because of her past, and I don't know how to convince her she isn't." The way you put it in your post it sounded like she asked if you/other people think she's a whore and you were just like "I dunno, maybe"

That sort of implies you think she might be a whore 




 If only one is drunk, the sober person is at fault. If both are very drunk, then it's not really either person's fault because neither could properly consent. 




 Sometimes even if you really love someone, there can just be too much emotional baggage to deal with and it's better to just start over. But that's not to say you can't work past things, either. 

Clearly, you are feeling the stress of being a sole financial provider in a situation where you just don't make enough. And that can put strain on any marriage, let alone one with as many problems as yours. This needs to change if things are going to get better. 

Speaking as someone with chronic mental illness, I know how difficult it can be to act as a functional adult. But at the same time, you can't grow if you never put yourself out there. Has your SO ever tried to get a job before? It's there possibly some kind of freelance work or something they could do from home that will bring in a little extra money? Perhaps you could encourage them to start applying to places. It can be scary, but ultimately you'll both be better off if they can help you carry the financial burden. But if they seriously aren't capable of working, they might be able to apply for SSI depending on if they're eligible. 

As for the cheating, there's no right time frame to be over something like that. It might help to talk to a counselor about it. 

I can see why you're terrified and I sincerely hope things get better for you soon. Feel free to PM if you ever need a sympathetic ear. 




 Seriously? The word "whore" is almost exclusively used to shame women for being sexual. And if you need to ask the internet whether or not your girlfriend comes off as a whore, that's pretty concerning. 

Like I said before, her sexual history is her business and no one else's. The only sort of person who would call her a whore for it a) is looking way too much into sometime else's private life where it doesn't concern them and b) is seriously judgemental. Who are these mysterious people she's concerned are judging her? Because if people are actually saying this she should tell them to fuck off. And as her boyfriend, you should reassure her that her past partners don't matter, because her self worth isn't inversely proportional to how many people she's slept with. 




 In my opinion, no, you should not get back together. You started dating a decade ago and broke up when you were what, 18? 19? You're in your mid-20s now. At this point you are probably very different people than when you first started dating or when you ended the relationship. So yeah, you might still have feelings for him, but it's not a great idea to get involved with someone out of childhood nostalgia when you have no idea if you have anything in common in the here and now. 

Another good reason to not do this would be the way you broke up. Not only did he side with his obviously prejudiced mom over you, he was horrible to you for a long time after the initial break up too. You said so yourself, what he did was unforgivable. Why would you want a relationship with someone who didn't trust you, turned against you, said horrible things to you, and then repeatedly insulted you? If you hadn't transferred, he would probably have continued to be petty and insult you whenever you met. Plus, you'd have to deal with his awful family again and that's no picnic. 

I'm glad he realized he was wrong and was big enough to own up to it and apologize, but that doesn't make all the things he did magically okay. You're right to be worried that if he burned you before he could do it again. He might have learned his lesson, but can you honestly trust him after all that? 




 I was about to ask the same question, but if you're still pretty young then it makes a lot more sense to wait a year. Also there's nothing weird about you or her; it's just that she's more comfortable with the idea of dating than you. No biggie. People deal with things differently. Just take your time and enjoy yourself - and try not to over think things too much. 




 Is your girlfriend currently getting paid to have sex with people? No? Then what on earth makes you think it's appropriate to ask if she's a whore?

If what you're actually asking is "does my girlfriend's sexual history make her (and/or myself) look bad" then the answer is still no, and it's still inappropriate to ask. If she is getting sober, good for her. If she regrets things the did in the past, well, no one's perfect. But how many and what sort of people she's had sex with is her business and no one else's, and broadcasting it all over the internet so you can get other people to tell you if it's okay to shame her is gross. 




 It could be a problem, but it is most likely not that big a deal. However, you should definitely talk to him about it. If you're feeling uncomfortable, you should do some self-exploration and try to figure what it is exactly about this that bothers you. Is it because you feel like he's giving more attention to her than you? Or maybe because you're feeling a little insecure? 

Once you think you've got that figured out, approach your bf. Tell him in a non-accusatory way what you're feeling and why. Make sure to use "I/me" statements. For example, "when you talk to your friend so much, I feel uncomfortable because [reason]" is better than "you shouldn't talk to her so much, you're making me feel bad." Focusing on your emotions rather than his actions can help you have a productive discussion where you feel validated but he doesn't have to get defensive.

If your bf cares about your feelings (which I'm sure he does) he wouldn't intentionally do something to hurt you. So if you approach him from a place of "I need your help with this problem" he'll be more willing to work with you and it's less likely to cause a fight. Hopefully you can both come to a solution that lets him keep his friend and puts you at ease. 

I think the most likely explanation is that he's just catching up with someone he hasn't talked to in a while. If they were out of touch but still on good terms, he probably just missed her company. It's natural after meeting up with an old friend to want to hang out with them a lot, so you can find it what's been going on with them, do all the stuff you missed out on when you were apart, and make new memories. 




 The ISSJ should have some sort of records of the adoption. I would start there. Find a way to contact them, tell them all these details, and see if they can point you in the right direction. 




 Honestly, if you don't like Sandy, John is a cheating douche, and everyone else is boring, why do you still hang it with these people? It sounds like the only person you're really friends with is Sandy's brother. So stop hanging out with everyone else and just chill one on one with that guy. You'd probably enjoy your time with him a lot more without all the other drama from other people. 




 Depending on where you live, there are lots of places that have free or cheap mental health services (like universities). It sounds like your girlfriend has been seriously traumatized, and also her mother is super toxic, so yeah, therapy asap would be good. 

And like others have said, a religious official would be the next best thing if you can't find a licensed therapist. Although, the caveat there is that most priests and such do not have any training in mental health problems. They can't give a diagnoses or proper treatment, they can just listen and try to help you as best they can. 

I also found [this](http://www.7cupsoftea.com/) website, never used it personally but it might be a good place to start and tide her over until you can find a more permanent solution 




 Well if you are married and you already have a previously communicated understanding that "if we get tipsy, it's cool to have sex still" then obviously that wouldn't be rape. You have a trust with that person, you've talked about it while sober before getting drunk, and you both know if you don't want to you can say something before drinking and nothing will happen. But most of the time when people talk about drunk sex and consent, the idea is that if you DON'T have a previous (sober) understanding and you come on to someone who's really drunk or they come on to you, they can't really consent at that point and you shouldn't have sex. 




 Lol I wish 




 Oh yeah I knew about the head trophy thing. So creepy. Ugh 




 I thought he dumped his victims in the woods? Bundy drove around a lot while looking for victims 




 Okay, I'll definitely talk to my gyno about it 




 I was actually referring to John Wayne Gacy, I'm pretty sure most of Dahmer's victims ended up buried out in the woods or shoved into barrels 




 I mentioned this in another comment, but I did bring up the possibility to my gyno at my last visit. But she was really reluctant to diagnose me. She said that apparently a lot of people come in thinking they have endometriosis but since the only way to actually diagnose it is through surgery, she wanted to exhaust all the other possibilities first. So I went through a whole bunch of tests to rule out other things. 




 Not gonna lie, your story sounds like a Criminal Minds episode. It seems to me like this secret admirer of yours doesn't really want to meet up, because then they could be rejected or their ideal meeting might not go as planned, so they're just yanking you around with all these "dates" that go nowhere. As long as they keep you at a distance, they have all the control and can keep up the fantasy indefinitely. 




 Maybe they assumed she was covered up for religious modesty? 




 That doesn't stop some people 




 If that's true this just got 11 times creepier 




 Um, no, no it wouldn't. I don't care who sent it. If they showed up at my doorstep it could be the sexiest man in the whole world for all I care and I would still tell him to fuck off and call the police after sending message like that. 

Edit: fixed autocorrect typos 




 I don't really, no, but at least three different people have suggested I might have it before. One of them was a nurse whenever I went to the emergency room once. 




 That sounds heavenly lol 




 At my next appointment I'm definitely gonna bring it up again because this period situation is getting ridiculous 




 That's a very good non-sarcastic answer (unlike mine) 




 I haven't tried that many kinds because doctor visits and filling prescriptions are expensive. But I've been heavily considering an IUD. I've heard a lot of good things about them. 




 Thanks! I appreciate it. Glad you finally found some relief! 




 Thanks for the suggestion. I'll try it 




 No problem, glad I can help. 

And at least in my opinion, it's not bad that you're happier in your new relationship, the bad part is that you were so miserable about your family situation before then that you would cry about it when seeing things like the wedding or birth announcements. That shows you were seriously stressed out about it, and that much stress really isn't healthy. 




 It sounds to me like OP is doing that. Saying you can't decide whether or not you can commit long-term to someone even after two years is a bit of a stretch. There are people who get engaged after knowing each other for a few months, and people who live together more than a decade before getting married. It's just finding what works for you. 

Now when it comes to involving the child, of course it gets more complicated. I don't think it should necessarily have to be that the kids of a single parent never meet anyone while they're just dating. You should definitely wait to make sure you like them, but it would also be bad to wait too long. What if, hypothetically, OP waited to introduce this guy to her daughter after five years of dating? Or ten? Then after getting seriously committed and definitely knowing they're in love and want to get married, she introduces daughter, and only then finds out her partner and children are incompatible? That would be bad for all parties involved. I think if you introduce the child slowly to the person before ever mentioning being a family, it wouldn't be so bad. But that's just my two cents.

You're right, her daughter is having issues and that's certainly a problem. But I don't think that not seeing this guy because you think she can't possibly know him well enough isn't really the answer. Also, they're dating if they say they are dating. 

I agree, single parents should be really careful about who they bring home to their kids. I was the child of a single mom, so yeah, I know first hand what that does to a kid. My mom and step dad got divorced when I was already 18, but my much younger siblings struggles with it for a while. My mom found a new guy, and they got serious pretty fast - they were engaged within a year of the start of their relationship. This was mitigated by the fact they had been childhood friends (so therefore knew each other really well) but until my mom started dating him I'd never even heard of this guy. 

So yeah, there was a huge adjustment period for everyone. I was already in college so I wasn't affected as much, but my brother was just starting high school and my sister was still in elementary school whenever my mom got divorced from their dad. And my brother had huge issues accepting his new father figure. In fact, he even accused my mom's fiance of abuse. It wasn't true - I know this for a fact because I witnessed the incident personally - but it was indicative of the fact that those two were not at all getting along. But this had less to do with my mom bringing home a new dad and more to do with the fact that my brother had severe mental health issues and was manipulated and enabled by my step father to hate the new guy, act out against my mom, and generally be a terror. 

My sister, on the other hand, ended up liking him just fine. It was confusing for her at first, but she got over it pretty quickly. Much like OP, my mom's ex husband was abusive and a poor caretaker, and my mom was horribly lonely after breaking up with him. And she probably rushed into her new relationship a bit. But they are happily married now, and I can say my sister is much better off being taken care of by two happy, loving parents in a stable relationship than she was by my mom while single, overworked, and miserable, or by my mom and step dad when they were still together. 




 I'll talk to my gyno about it next time I go. 




 I'm turning 23 next month. I do want to have kids, but I'll probably only have one through pregnancy, the rest through adoption. So obviously I'm not going to do it anytime soon. It's just a very tempting thought whenever I'm in the middle of my period. 

As for whether my cycle changes after getting pregnant, I've also heard this is possible, but if genetics have anything to say about it I probably won't be that lucky. My paternal grandmother had awful periods, and I'm pretty sure she just waited for menopause to deal with it. My mom had so many problems with periods (horrible cramps and extremely heavy flow for two weeks or so) she got an endometrial ablation. That was after three kids. So I can hope, but I'm not holding my breath on that one, lol.

I've started talking to a gyno about it more recently as I've realized more and more that this isn't totally normal, and we're working on it, so hopefully we will figure something out. Thanks for your thoughts and internet hugs, I appreciate it. 




 I don't get the appeal behind obsessing over celebrity gossip, either. I'm with you - who cares? Just let people do their own thing. 




 I feel like this is another entry for #relentlesslygay and I love everything about it. 




 I haven't tried the pill continuously, although it it's tempting. I might have to talk to my doctor about that. 




 I haven't tried the shot, but I was on the pill where you had a period every three months (as well as the usual monthly kind). It was nice that I didn't have to deal with it as often, but it still sucked whenever I did have one. 




 Yikes. Mine do last a while but not that long or heavy. I'm glad you found a treatment that helped and I hope your surgery goes well. 

I have been talking to my gyno about this, and she's done some tests. I don't have any STDs and uterus liked normal in two different ultrasounds, so I'm still not sure what the problem is. At one point a nurse brought up the possibility of endometriosis, but my gyno is reluctant with that because the only way to know for sure is exploratory surgery and she wants to rule out everything else before we try that. 




 One of my biggest issues with the vast majority of pro-lifers I've met is that they preach all day long about the sanctity of a fetus but are simultaneously against any form of welfare for that child once it's born and are against the LGBTQ "life style". If you really cared about life that much, you would have a little more empathy for the children who are born into poverty, abusive homes, and/or discrimination. That's why I call those people "anti-choice" rather than "pro-life".

Now, if you're against abortion because you want to protect the fetus, but also apply that same consideration and respect for life to the poor, queer folks, women, racial minorities, etc. then I will respectfully disagree with your stance on certain medical procedures but I will gladly work with you on other things. 




 That is super fucking creepy. I would say "alert the police" but they won't actually do anything because they don't really care in most cases and it's not technically illegal until after they've already kidnapped you and buried you in their crawlspace 




 Oh yes, Lord forbid we allow young people to know how sex and love and relationships work. That would be so awful. Much better to shame their bodies and their sexuality, so that they're vulnerable to peer pressure, STIs, unwanted pregnancy, dysfunctional relationships, abuse, assault, etc. You know, the way God intended. 




 Fyi, asexual =/= no libido. Just say no libido. But you're right, the sudden drop is somewhat abnormal and talking to a gyno would probably be a good idea. Depending on where you live you might not need parental approval for an appointment - some states in the U.S. allow you to go doctors at 16 without parental permission. You can always call a local gyno and ask if you need permission from your mom to make an appointment. If not, then you're golden. If you do, you might be able to at least just talk to one over the phone about your problem. 




 I hate my periods. I know, shocker, right? But bear with me, I just need to rant. 

Well I can't speak for all of you who have them, but I'm pretty sure mine are somewhere in the worse end of the spectrum. I get all the terrible symptoms. Cramps, diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting, bloating, motion sickness, sweating, chills, all that nonsense. Every month it's like I have the flu only with an added helping of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Even if I take triple or quadruple the dose of ibuprofen, it barely takes the edge off of the pain. If I don't take them, I'm completely non-functioning for 24-36 hours. All I will do is writhe around my bed in pain; forget eating, and sleeping is elusive at best. Even the pill didn't help much - the pain was about the same, the only benefit was that I was more able to predict when I would start so I could properly medicate. 

Today I started this morning and decided to go to work anyway. I thought that, armed with tampons and a lot of pain killers, I could make it through the shift. Nope. I had to duck out about an hour later and go home. Now I'm resigned to once again spending the first day of my cycle doing absolutely nothing but lying in bed and occasionally getting up to use the bathroom. 

I feel like my body is holding me hostage. I hate having to deal with this crippling pain every. Single. Month. I hate having to plan my entire life around when I'll inevitably end up starting my flow and therefore be incapable of going to work, school, errands, etc. I'm so tired of having a functioning, biologically female body. I'm seriously considering getting a hysterectomy because I don't want to have to deal with this anymore. Ugh. 

TwoX, you are some lovely people, and I'm sure at least some of you can relate. Feel free to commiserate with me or whatever, I just needed to get that off my chest. 




 Yeah, that is actually bad. But considering that she had a baby at 16 and was in a very abusive relationship that young, she's bound to have some emotional baggage when it comes to relationships and family. At the very least, it sounds like she's becoming more stable, but it would probably help OP and her family in the long run if went to therapy to help deal with that. 




 Exactly! Asexual doesn't mean no sex drive, it means no sexual attraction to any particular sex/gender. There are plenty of aces with low sex drives or who don't like sex, but that's not all of us and that's okay! Everyone is a little different. 




 You have no clue what a date is.

Do you know what a date is? Because it seems like you're saying that going out to dinner with someone isn't a date. Also, you say that OP shouldn't be talking about what she wants from a relationship before agreeing to date because that's why we date? What are you talking about? Those sorts of conversations are extremely important, and can happen whether or not you are officially dating someone. You say words are just words, but the fact that OP took extensive time to discuss a potential relationship with her partner before they committed in any way to each other seems like she was practicing good communication skills and took a lot of time to think about her decision before making it. I fail to see how that's a bad thing. 

Also, are you seriously going to vilify her for having a relationship that didn't work out? Haven't you ever dated someone and broken up because you weren't really compatible in the long term? That's super common. 

I will, however, agree that she should probably take things slow with this new relationship. If they love each other, great, but when you have kids you have to make sure your partners and kids get along, and that doesn't happen overnight. She shouldn't be moving in with this guy until her daughter is more comfortable around him, but she's also said they're waiting a year for that, which could be enough time for her daughter to get used to him, or it could not. 




 That's fair. It's definitely a complicated situation and a lot to think about. Whatever you decide to do, just try to keep in mind that your daughter's feelings are valid and she's a human being too. As adults we know that sometimes kids are unreasonable, but we tend to forget that as kids our emotions seemed completely reasonable and important at the time. So just try to have a little empathy about the way your daughter is feeling, and it should help resolve things. 




 I don't think wanting to be married at 21 is unreasonable or unfair, but you also can't force someone to want it too. I think OP was having a compatibility issue - she was ready to settle down but her ex wasn't, they both recognized that and ended the relationship. Now she's with someone who does want to settle down. I don't see how any of that is bad? 




 I understand it's hard to wrap your head around, it's just exhausting when you're the only ace person all your friends know so you constantly have to play 20 questions when you come out to people. 

And I actually feel really similar to the way you describe sex - I'm mostly indifferent and I don't seek it out usually, but I still find it enjoyable for various reasons when I do it. So yeah, it's really frustrating when I'm like "hey babe wanna have sex" and my fiance is like "I do but no, because I don't want you to be uncomfortable"

What?? 




 When did OP ever state her age?

Edit: duh, it was in the title, never mind.

Still though, I really don't think that matters much. 




 Sometimes when kids get attached to one parental figure but the parents break up, they resent the new parental figure because they feel like they have no control over the situation. It's possible that in her mind, you're taking away someone she liked and forcing her to deal with someone new, even though she never asked for a new parent and didn't want one. 

At that age especially children need stability, and your changing relationship dynamic is upsetting that. It's like if she had a favorite toy that she'd played with for years, but then suddenly one day you took it away saying "this toy is broken, have a new one" and no matter how much she cried you wouldn't give the old one back. You're taking away something loved and familiar, replacing it with something foreign and unknown, and expecting her to just accept it. Of course she'll be upset.

Even though you're right when you say that your daughter doesn't get to decide who you're with, she's only five. She doesn't understand that. She only sees you being unfair and refusing to listen to what she wants. And she's definitely not alone in this - a lot of kids (of all ages) refuse to acknowledge a new partner in their parent's life, especially if they've already bonded with the old one. 

I think the best thing you can do is to make sure you hear your daughter out. Let her know you care about how she feels. Even if you won't do what she says (because you can't give her everything she wants), it's not because you're trying to be mean or you're ignoring her feelings. You're trying to do what's best for you and your daughter by marrying someone who wants a family, and I'm sure you have plenty of reasons why this is true. But your daughter might not know that. She isn't using your rationale - she's only working off of what her little five year old brain knows. If your daughter still likes your ex and he still has contact with her, it might help to let her know that she can still like him and visit him if she wants. You're not taking that relationship away. If anything, you're just bringing one more person into her life to love and care for her. 




 Nope, you were totally in the right on this one. I hate the assumption that parents deserve respect just *because parents*. Especially in cases like my parents (or yours, from the look of it) that are abusive, neglectful, or otherwise incapable of parenting. Respect should be earned, and although most parents do deserve at least some respect for taking care of you, if they aren't actually talking care of you why should you respect them?

Your mother is clearly immature at best, and you merely told the truth. The person who told you that calling your mom out on her bullshit was disrespectful because you're her child is simultaneously shutting you down and enabling your mom's behavior. You're allowed to recognize when someone is being unreasonable, regardless of how they're related to you. If you don't question your parent's poor choices or behavior, they'll only continue to walk all over you until it ruins your relationship. 




 Well fugue states are usually when you disassociate completely from your identity, your brain basically tricks you into believing you're someone completely different, and you live as if you'd always been the new identity your mind creates. So honestly that's not too far off from what you're describing. At the very least I can't think of a better word, other than just dissociation in general 




 I started a Tumblr blog to vent about my PTSD. Eventually I might share it with my fiance, friends, or family, but I don't think I'm ready yet. 




 I have PTSD from childhood abuse, and I know how badly it can fuck up your life. It really sounds like you need to talk to your therapist about all this stuff, but if you feel like regular sessions aren't enough you can also reach out in other ways for help. 

There are lots of crisis hotlines, support groups, etc. for victims of sexual violence, as well as people with PTSD. You should look online for local organizations like that. A good support group can be a great supplement to individual therapy. It really helps to know you aren't the only one going through something like that. 

Also, you mentioned that you and your boyfriend broke up because of your emotional changes and behavior after the trauma. I know you feel like you screwed up that relationship forever, but if you never told him what happened to you then obviously he wouldn't understand what's going on. It can be ready hard to confide in someone about traumatic events, but it might do you some good to come clean to him. Even if you don't get back together, it might help you both get some mutual understanding about what was happening. I'm sure he noticed something wasn't right, and if he knew the reason why you suddenly changed he would probably be more willing to let go of all that.

Another serious thing you should consider is how you're self-medicating with alcohol. I'm sure you don't need me to tell you this is bad. It's tempting to try to drink until you forget, but trust me, this doesn't work. You need to find healthier ways to deal with this stuff. Maybe consider going to AA to help deal with this problem. 

Finally, I just want you to know that what happened to you wasn't your fault and your reaction is totally normal. You didn't deserve to be assaulted, and everything you described - from the way you reacted when it was happening to the turmoil it left you in up until now - is actually super common for people who go through stuff like this. I sincerely hope you can learn to love yourself and open up to others again and that you get the help you need. If you want, feel free to PM me to talk about whatever. 




 I'm panromantic and ace. I'm just really tired in general of having to explain what that means. Also, I'm tired of people assuming that because I'm asexual that I don't like/want to have sex. Especially my partners. I've only been with two people but both of them have expressed that they feel guilty for being horny all the time when they know I'm not, to the point where they would turn me down when I offered to have sex with them. If I didn't want to do it I wouldn't have offered, and if I was annoyed by your sex drive I wouldn't be with you! Geez. 




 My college roommate had the more toxic variety. His family tried to call the university to get access to his account, which they were denied. Then they called him up personally and tried to bully him into giving his password to them, which he eventually did just so they'd get off his back. He immediately changed it after getting off the phone. 

I asked him what the big deal was and apparently they wanted all his account info because they were helping him get loans and were thoroughly convinced he would spend his money irresponsibly. They also believed he was getting drunk all the time freshman year because they assumed he would be the partying type. Mfw he's the most fiscally responsible person in the entire dorm and didn't drink at all until two years later when he became of age. 




 Oh, cool. I didn't know that, thanks! 




 Meanwhile the asshat is more than willing to wax poetically about how educated they are on a word they didn't make describing something that will never happen to them so they clearly know better about what it means than the community of people who coined it. 




 I'm not from Michigan, but the US south. It sucks here for queer people 95% of the time, basically. In my state, for the longest time only one city - the city I currently live in - had a comprehensive nondiscrimination policy. Currently, that number has grown ... to eight cities. Eight cities in an entire fucking state have passed laws so I won't be fired or evicted if someone finds out I'm non-binary. Yeah.

Oh, and even in this, the relatively tolerant city, I have regularly had people harass me on the street because I'm visibly queer. My roommate had people try to grope, harass, or even sexually proposition him so frequently he was afraid to ride public transportation or walk home alone. He's trans. And don't get me started on things my family, former friends, and ex-church pastor have said about the LGBTQ community. 




 Exactly. I really hate when people say "I'm not a homophobe, I'm not afraid of gays." That isn't the only way phobia is used!! If the fb poster in OP's picture ACTUALLY knew anything about grammar or etymology, they'd know that "phobia" can also mean a strong aversion to something - like how something is hydrophobic if it repels water. 




 It sounds like you're into domination. There isn't necessarily anything wrong with that, as long as you practice safe, sane, consensual sex when you are with a partner. It's definitely a thing, a thing lots of people are into. And it doesn't make you mean or a bad person for liking it. You should check out some BDSM subreddits (of which there are many) and ask around there. 

As far as low sex drive goes, it's possible you're on the asexual spectrum? Lots of demi, ace, and gray-a folks have lower sex drives on average compared to the general population. For that ask around on /r/asexuality. 




 Yes, it is totally okay not to know! A lot of people go through this, especially in their teens and twenties as that's the time when you're starting to figure out a lot of things about yourself, but it can happen at any stage of life. 

What you're feeling is totally normal. There is no right way to figure out your sexuality, it's something everyone has to come to in their own time on their own terms. Try not to stress out too much about it. You'll figure it out eventually. Just go with what feels right in the now, and if later on you settle on something else that's fine, too! 




 It's very possible that you were traumatized by that experience and you now feel uncomfortable in the place that reminds you of the attack. Not to mention dealing with CPS and other legal issues can be very stressful. I would highly suggest you go see a therapist. They can help you process all the anxiety you're feeling and will hopefully mitigate some of the stress. 




 Colleges usually have a lot of different volunteer organizations, or various groups that need volunteers. You could start by looking for a general volunteer organization. When I was a freshman in college I joined a service fraternity called Alpha Phi Omega, and we did lots of great projects with the Girl Scouts, the local children's hospital, Ronald McDonald House, and animal shelters.

Alternatively, try starting with something that seems interesting to you or that you personally care about and connect it to a volunteer activity. For instance, if you or someone you know has ever had a medical condition like cancer or diabetes, there are constantly volunteer events for things like that. Alternatively, if you want to be more politically involved you could join an activist group for an issue you can get behind. I have one friend who loves martial arts, and he works for a charity that gives people free martial arts training for those who otherwise couldn't afford it. Another friend of mine loves gardening, and she works for an organization that teaches people about healthier eating and plants local community gardens. Find something you're passionate about and go from there. 




 That "keyed up" feeling sounds a lot like hyperarousal, but could also be a more general anxiety. It's hard to tell for sure based on a few paragraphs from some stranger on the internet. It's definitely possible you have PTSD, but like I said earlier only a therapist can really determine that. Did you want help looking for resources? 




 Hey, Alice! Congrats on taking such a huge personal step. Welcome to the sub, we're all petty nice folks here! I'm always glad to see a new face :) 




 Wow, that is incredibly fucking rude. I'm sorry your gf's mom is being awful, OP. Hopefully she learns that sort of thing isn't okay and this won't be a problem in the future. 




 Well, recurring nightmares are definitely a common symptom for PTSD, but far from the only symptom. If nightmares and anxiety about a certain thing are the only problems you have this could just as easily be something else, like a phobia.

This [link](http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/PTSD-overview/basics/symptoms_of_ptsd.asp) has a list of all the symptoms for PTSD in really easy to understand language rather than medical jargon, so it might help you sort out some of your confusion to go through the list and compare it to your own experiences. If you're meeting a lot of those criteria, chances are pretty good you have PTSD. However, the best way to know for sure is to see a therapist and talk about what's going on so they can properly diagnose you. 




 Well that's what happens when you create an open source language learning software. People make stuff for the languages they know best and care most about, but not necessarily the ones that make the most sense. On the upside, it's the only free program I know of teaching Gaelic. 




 Yes, feeling guilty is absolutely normal. A lot of people go through this, and you aren't alone. I'm glad I could help, and I hope you get some much needed rest. 




 Okay, here's a link to a [crisis center](http://www.saccec.org/Services.html) that offers free counseling in your state. Please call them, they have a 24 hour hotline. I'm sure they can help you get the resources and help you need. 

I honestly can relate to how you're feeling. I went through a very similar feeling whenever I first escaped an abusive home. My brother physically abused me for about a decade when I still lived with my family, but once I was old enough for college I moved to a new city to get away from him. 

I needed to get out for my own health and safety, but I still felt horribly guilty and anxious because I left behind my little sister. She is five years younger than my brother and was only nine years old when I left home. Although I was definitely the main target of his abuse, I was older than him and still larger than him up until I was in high school, so I could defend myself. My sister, on the other hand, was only half his size. I was terrified that after I left he would turn on her, and I had seen him get violent with her before (although rarely). 

My step father (the father of both my siblings but not me) was emotionally abusive and whenever I refused contact with my brother he would often use my sister as a guilt trip, saying I was a horrible sister because I wasn't there for my siblings or that she missed me and didn't understand why I wouldn't visit her. I was really torn up about it for a long time. I felt like I was a failure for not being there for her and protecting her when I knew it was not only possible but likely that my brother would hurt her. 

At the end of the day though, only my brother was and is responsible for his actions. I was a child when these awful things happened to me. So were you. No one is capable of handling that sort of trauma well, and children certainly shouldn't be expected to deal with that sort of thing. What happened to you was a tragedy. But at the point where you could have warned those girls, you still didn't even fully comprehend what happened to you. So no one should expect you to have been able to save them - you were still dealing with your own issues. That's not your fault. It is your abuser's. You need to get to a place where you can handle your own problems before you can really do anything about someone else's. 




 Honestly, even if you had said something to those girls, there is no guarantee they would have believed you or that it would have prevented your grandfather from abusing them. Regardless, if they were also abused, that is not your fault. You are a victim. Your grandfather is the only one responsible for his actions.

You seriously need therapy, and I know you said you have some financial/insurance obstacles to that. But there are still resources out there for free that help people like you. What country/region do you live in? 




 I read an article a little while back about a woman who decided to design a bunch of space-themed girls clothing because she had a similar view 




 And having that experience would be beneficial for him. But suggesting that OP should just refuse to do anything for an entire week out of nowhere rather than talk about it would likely backfire in a major way. 




 No, that's called being an asshole. "You don't appreciate me so rather than talking about it like a normal adult I'm going to make life harder for you." Showing him what she does would involve actually showing him - having him spend the day with her and watch as she takes care of the baby and cleans the house and runs errands. 




 I don't think passive aggressive bullshit is going to help OP out here. She'd be better off making a journal where she writes down all the stuff she does, or having him stay home for a day/weekend while she does errands So he sees where she's coming from. 




 Perhaps the next time someone only congratulates you for the baby, you could respond with something like "thanks, I'm glad that husband is able to support us with his job so that I can give baby the attention he needs." Make sure you take the time every once in a while to thank him for helping you. He probably feels lonely because you have to spend so much time with the baby, and it might help if you make comments like that so he knows that you still support him. 




 To me it sounds like he's in a space where he's doing all this work but not getting recognized, meanwhile you do something that plenty of people do all the time and you're getting all this attention. However, what he fails to notice is that carrying a child, giving birth, and raising a baby are all a lot of work. Sure, plenty of people have the necessary biology to have a baby. But that doesn't mean that they are all capable of being good parents. 

Being a SAHM is a full time job with no benefits, you don't get paid, you're always on call with no regular hours, and if you fail a performance review you can be incarcerated. That is a big fucking deal. Yes, it is hard to work at a full time job. But he needs to recognize that you are doing a lot of work too, and you shouldn't feel bad about taking some time for your self now and then. Does he expect you to wear yourself ragged all the time constantly carrying for this infant? At what point will you have done enough work to "earn" all the congratulations you've gotten in his eyes?

This is a serious problem between you two, and you need to deal with it sooner rather than later. If this continues, the kid will pick up on the fact his dad doesn't respect you, which means that as he gets older he might not respect you either. Not to mention that parents really need to be on the same page when it comes to discipline on order for it to be effective. At the very least you should talk to him about it, but consider couples therapy if the problem doesn't improve soon. 




 Funny how much more alarming that looks when you put it in bar graph form 




 So would it make it better if she was on love with him the whole time? I don't think so. People are allowed to change their opinions of others. She wasn't interested until she got to know this guy better. That happens ALL THE TIME. And there's nothing wrong with two consenting adults deciding to have casual sex. 

I would argue that it's better she only had a one night stand with him. Everyone acts as if it's so petty, but honestly if it were me I'd rather my friend slept with a guy I like just the once (which means he is still single and possibly able to date me at some point) than starting a relationship with him which means I would have no chance at all. 




 That's the plan ;) 




 Thanks! I've had it for a few days now and I'm really loving it. 




 I never said the friend's feelings don't matter or that she shouldn't be upset. In fact I said several times that I would totally expect her to be upset. Just not that she should be entirely upset with OP when it's not OP's fault her friend never told this guy she's been crushing on for years that she liked him. 




 Well for me the bottom line is that OP's friend needs to do something about her crush rather than waiting around for something to happen.

Yes, OP could have been more considerate, but I also don't blame her for sleeping with this dude. Not doing anything about a crush for two years seems to imply that you aren't that serious about it. The friend isn't entirely innocent here - if she had these feelings for that long and refused after repeated urges to act on them, it seemed to me like she was insisting on keeping things one-sided. 




 Feelings aren't always reasonable, and no one *owes* you their friendship.

This is true, which is why I said that it wasn't unreasonable for OP's friend to be upset for a little while. If I were in that situation, I would initially be upset too. I might be mad that my crush was with someone else, or jealous that my friend was with someone I liked when I wanted to be the one taking him home from the club. But ultimately I would be most mad at myself, for never even trying to talk to him about it. Which is why I think that OP's friend will hopefully get past this. She shouldn't be mad at her friend for fucking a guy. She should be mad for not putting herself out there and making an effort to get what she wants. If you never chase your dreams, the only person you can truly blame for not achieving them is yourself. 




 Pretty sure this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I'm leaning toward siding with OP on this one. 

It would be one thing if you found out your friend had this crush a week ago and fucked the guy anyway. It would be bad if you did it because you were mad at her and wanted to get back at her by screwing her crush. 

*However*, she pined away for this guy for yeeeaaaars. You told her to go for it and tell him how she feels, trying to be a supportive friend. But she still didn't act on her feelings. So when you had an opportunity you decided to sleep with him. 

Was this the polite thing to do? No. Is it expected for her to be upset? Yeah. But does you having a one night stand have any effect whatsoever on her eventually asking him out or dating him? Nope. She doesn't own him. You're all adults. If she wanted to be with him that badly she should have said something, or at the very least joined you when you invited her to hang out with you at the club. You snooze you lose. 

Honestly if your friend is reasonable, she's going to be jealous and upset for a while but this will hopefully blow over. If not, fuck it. I wouldn't want a friend who sat on her hands for two years and refused to make a move on a guy and then got upset whenever someone else came along and had some fun with him. Does she seriously expect him to not have sex or a relationship with anyone else while she has feelings for him that he doesn't know about? Because that's just unreasonable and stupid. 




 I personally wouldn't see my SO talking to other people as cheating. Imho, people can't help who they're attracted to and the idea that even thinking about it is somehow cheating is silly. That would be punishing someone for having thoughts or feelings. I have thoughts all the time about doing dumb or inappropriate things, that doesn't mean I'm a horrible person or that I would actually do it. Sometimes it's just entertaining to think about. And I actually talk with my SO about people we're attracted to all the time. Then again, I'm also poly so if my SO told me he liked someone I wouldn't care if he had a side relationship.

The way I personally define cheating is if your partner is dishonest about sexual or romantic interactions with other people, or does things that aren't previously agreed upon. For instance, my SO and I have agreed that flirting with other people is fine. If someone he flirted with invited him on a date or propositioned him with sex, he would have to tell me before he acted on it. If he didn't tell me about it first, then it would be cheating. 

Based on my definition, what you're doing isn't cheating because there's nothing going on between you and Jay that friends wouldn't normally do. Friends talk to each other and text. It's not cheating just to have feelings for someone or to be physically attracted to them. Otherwise most people would be cheating on their SOs with celebrities and porn. Of course, many people consider porn or thinking about someone else cheating but I personally see that as rather impractical considering we can't control how we feel, only how we act. But you should still be careful about how you handle your friendship to make sure it doesn't cross the line. 

All that said, if you and your current bf are fighting a lot, it's possible that it's contributing to your feelings for this other guy. A lot of people start getting wandering eyes whenever their current relationship is less than stellar, honestly that's human nature. Could it be that you're crushing on him because he's giving you the emotional attention you aren't getting from bf? If so, it will probably pass if you worked things out with him. But if you think your feelings for the other guy are genuine, perhaps it's time to move on and try something new. 




 I'm happy to hear you got out of such a nasty relationship and are reclaiming all the stuff your ex made you give up. Hopefully things with the new SO work out. Thanks for sharing, and best wishes! 




 I don't wear them very often, but I've never had problems with heels. Then again I took ballet so I'm used to weird foot positions. 

The trick is to walk as if you're walking on your tip toes. 




 I'm 22, the last two people I went on days with were 22 and 26. They are also three only two people I've dated so there is no third 




 As a vocalist, I would absolutely love a partner who could sing. Especially one that I could sing with. It would be so awesome! Sadly none of my partners have ever bee musical... 




 It is not healthy for couples to fight like this, especially over something so small. I think you both have some communication issues, especially if a fight like that escalated so far. If you want to salvage the relationship you will definitely need couples counseling, but I would also recommend both of you getting therapy regardless. You need to learn better ways to deal with your anger and frustrations.

Also, your parents are 100% not helpful if their only response to a fight where you hit someone is "his anger is not healthy." BOTH of you need help, and hitting someone is never okay. If you feel awful and guilty, channel that into improving yourself so that this sort of thing doesn't happen ever again. 




 On the one hand, I firmly believe that everyone should have the most enjoyable sex and relationships possible, and I think it's usually a good thing when your partner makes a conscious effort to please you. Too many men think that their own orgasms are the focus of sex and neglect their female counterparts.

HOWEVER, like you said, it is possible to enjoy sex without orgasms. And orgasms aren't nearly as important as making sure your mental health is taken care of. 

It sounds to me like your bf is putting his own sexual desires and needs above your mental health, and that is not okay. You shouldn't have to have an orgasm if you don't want to, and you *especially* shouldn't have to stop taking your meds (which are obviously important and have helped you manage your mental health!) just so that he can feel satisfied with what you do in bed. 

Helping your partner achieve orgasm should be about wanting to please them, make them feel good and be happy. But if your boyfriend insists on continuing sex to the point that it's going to be painful because you can't orgasm, when you tell him you don't think it's worth it, he's not doing it for you - he's doing it because he's trying to prove he is a good lover. And when he says "you should stop taking your meds so you can orgasm" he is basically telling you that his ability to perform sexually, regardless of what you want, is more important than your ability to function from day to day. That's fucked up!

It seems like your bf is really avoiding talking about your depression, but this is a discussion you really need to have, asap. He needs to understand why your meds are so crucial and what your mental health needs are. If he cares about you, then he should care about things that have such a direct and broad impact in your life. And if he doesn't care, then maybe he doesn't care enough about you and you need to rethink this relationship. You deserve to be treated with respect, and people who don't take your mental health seriously aren't worth your time. 




 Honestly his opinion isn't as important as my mom's, it's not like we're super close. But considering that he is married to my mom he's going to (hopefully) be a permanent fixture in my life, and I would like to get asking with him. 

I will probably update after I talk to them about how it went, but it might be a while. 




 Yes, that's true. I feel like the odd one out around my family, and my PTSD is part of that I think.

You're also right about their sympathies. When I decided to no longer be in contact with my step father, my mom supported me because she had just devorced him and she knew how awful he was. But I can't expect her to completely turn away from her child. And part of why I never really talked to her about the abuse is I didn't want to seem like I was trying to turn her against my brother. But on the other hand, I am her child too and I still want my mom to back me up and take care of me. It's a very emotionally complicated situation for all of us.

As far as her new husband goes, by the time they got married I was already an adult living on my own far away from them, so he just hadn't been around long enough to see why my brother and I have such a toxic relationship. I've severely limited my contact with my brother and so he's only seen me avoid him a lot, never a full-blown fight. 

I feel like I heard that fact at some point and then forgot about it, but it is definitely useful and I will bring that up also whenever I talk about it with them. Thank you for taking the time to help me out and your kind words. 




 Thank you! I'm glad you think so 




 Thanks! 




 Thank you :) 




 I'm glad you think so :) 




 Thanks! I originally went in for just the color, and then the stylist suggested I go ahead and get my bangs trimmed and she fixed it like that. I like how it turned out. 




 Fair enough. 




 Thank you! 




 I remember the first time I realized I would be relieved whenever my abuser died. You're not crazy, OP - your mother sounds awful and I would feel the same way in your position. Hang in there, I hope you make it through this tough time okay.
