 When stating the absurd and unlikely, do you really have to clarify if it's a joke or not?  




 So, then why didn't you slice the meat for him?  




 Do you know how much it cost to fix a car like that?  And you can't just take it to any old body shop. 

That car is wroth millions and if that repair is done incorrectly, it could destroy the value.  




 I'm with you!  I wanted to down vote him, but I'll up vote you instead. 

I'm married and love my wife, but I'd kill her for one night with Emma Watson.  




 My bird seed doesn't lady two days, when I fill up my feeders.  




 I'm a big fan of Bernie, but he's Pro governed, he'd never shut down a federal agency. 

Rand Paul on the other hand... 




 Rand Paul is making it an issue of his.  




 No kidding!  He's such a professional on the course, he's allowed to act his age when he's not.  On the course includes the clubhouse and grounds  (interviews), off is everywhere else.  




 Roose is such a horrible and evil person, that you can't help but like the guy.   

People think that Ramsey is a monster, but Roose raised that guy.  

But either way, I hate and love the TV show and book Roose more than I should.  




 Never seem A Dangerous Method.

I just thought that these two movies would have more of the same feel.  My expectations were kind of high.  




 Sure it was.  If I gave Eastern 1 star, then history would be 5 times better, but I gave it two and a half, so twice is technically correct. 

Or is my math wrong?  




 A History of Violence was at least 5 times better. 

I LOVED A History of Violence and thought that Eastern Promises looked like a great film.  I'd give it 2.5 out of 5 stars. 

So if we want to be technical, history was twice as good as promises. 




 Too far and expensive for that to be my home course.  We play there when ever we find a good deal on golfnow.com.   Couple times a season.  




 So, you wouldn't recommend it?  




 Seen Seven, and I kind of remember Zodiac.  




 I saw Social Network. Thought it was pretty good.  




 Couldn't agree more.  




 I don't even know what that means.  Is Fincher the director or the writer of the book? 

Gone Girl wasn't good?  What didn't you like? 

What would you recommend then?  




 Holy crow, that ending!  It's 10:30 at night, and my heart is pounding like I just watched a horror film.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to sleep tonight. 

I loved how it was broken up into 3 parts.  The last part was shorter than the rest, but the most horrifying. 

I clearly haven't read the book. Does it have the same ending? 




 Drugs are bad,  mkay. 




 Cersei is going to be put in trial by the faith and she will request a trial by combat.  She will name The Mountain as her champion.  The faith will bring in The Hound as their champion. 

Get fucking hype.  




 It boggles my mind, how much detail there is in those books.  How does he keep track of it all and how far in advance is he thinking? 

Man, I bet he'd be tough as nails in chess... 




 Wow, look at that.  




 Closing time.  You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.  E.g. get the fuck out.  




 I haven't played 1, 2, or 3, and this was my first time on 4. I live in the nw burbs, so I don't get down that way often.  We will play broken arrow and ruffled feathers a few times a year.  




 He got tired of being in the background and not cared about.  There was a group of people that worshipped him as a god.  

Let that happen to you and see if it doesn't go to your head.  




 When everyone learns, the memes will stop.  




 I played St. Andrews in west chicago the day before and shot an 88. Shot a 103 on Dubsdread...  but it was also 91 degree with 80% humidity and cart path only.  My drives were all off, and I flubbed 6 pitches or chips into the sand. 

I want to play again in a few months when it's not so hot.  

On a Friday afternoon the pace was great.  4 hour round.  I've heard the weekends drag to 5+, which is unacceptable as far as I care. 

The fairways were great, the rough was really long, and the greens were lightning quick. 

Is it worth it? All things considered, I'd day yes, on occasion.  









 Except for the fact that it would be cheaper to just get the cars ac fixed.  




 Couldn't it be a lifter?  Maybe only the top end needs a rebuild.  




 That's the type of parent I want to be.  




 It's the first and oldest tournament.  All other opens are just copying The Open.  It doesn't need to be called anything else.  




 Rickon. 




 Those types of fireworks are illegal in Illinois.  




 I didn't down vote (not going to up vote either), but it's just a sparrow.  Used to get those fuckers in at Firestone once ever couple weeks in the summer.  




 I know it was a joke, but they aren't even taking about the biggest issue holding back self driving cars...

Software crashes.  How often does your computer or smartphone freeze?  Now picture that happening on the highway at freeway speeds...

Built in safety redundant procedures aren't going to work if the PCM is frozen.  




 No, I said that 9 out of 10 that I call in for an interview don't even show up for that interview or have a poor attitude. 

We tell every person that we have 3 requirements.  Show up on time, follow directions, and don't talk the whole time on the line.  If they can agree to those 3 requirements, they got the job.  If they do those 3 things they get to keep their job and get yearly raises.  




 Yes, my total was 25 instead of 20.

But I was trying to argue against the guy who's post I was replying too.   

That yes, many blacks do have a poor attitude and appear not to work, and that I have experience that can back that up. 

But then I also said that I blame the "black culture" that has been developed due to oppression and poor education. 

It's your white guilt (I'm assuming) that is making you think I am racist. 

I don't work near poor white trailer parks, but if I did, I'm guessing that the hiring pool would be rather crappy there too.  




 Thank you!  




 I've hired plenty of blacks.  Have 6 working for us right now.  




 As I stated above, every time I've called an "Africa American" that to their face, they laugh and tell me that they're black. 

And yeah, it's a manual labor job, as it says in the add posting.  And yes, it's the poor attitude that disqualifies anyone from a job.  Much like you seem to have. 

Sorry that I'm not hiring CEO's, owners, or recording artist. I'm just a guy working in a warehouse with 50 other people, trying to keep the product coming in the door, product getting assembled, and then shipped.   It starts at $11, but I have guys making $20.  




 How am I racist? My passing along my experience? I've said that I blame the generations of oppression and lack of education. And every "Africa American" I've ever called that, has laughed at me and told me they were black.  I almost married a black girl from the inner city and dated several others. 

 




 What other "evidence" do you want? I'm simply pointing out an observation.  




 I'm saying out of those 5, on average, 9 out of 10 don't show up.  I've set up over 100 interviews in my time.  So, 5 out of 20, then 9 out of 10. Makes sense if you think about it.  




 I just golf every weekend, buy new clubs every 3 years, and drink expensive bourbon.  Traded one addiction for two... 




 And nothing has happened since 2008?

Makes me wonder what the distance of the current long drive world record.   I see that 541 (?) is the longest on a PGA tour event, but has anyone hit one longer? 

And 541 yards?! Is there a video of this? That's crazy!  




 As someone who has been responsible for interviewing and hiring recommendations, I can attests to this.  Out of 20 people interviewed for a factory job (basic assembly using hand tools, paying $11 to start), 5 will be black, 5 white, 10 latin, 5 other.  9 out of 10 of the blacks don't show up on time or at all, and then are greatly unqualified (mostly poor attitude).  I blame the "black culture" somewhat, but mostly the education system.   We've let down entire generations which is the cause of this "black culture".

I don't have a solution, just the observations.  




 Correct. If it was my daughter, I would be all sorts of pissed.  




 I wasn't watching.  I take it he won again?  I'll be watching the open and rooting for him! I'd love to see a one year grand slam.  




 No way!  We have a black president and took down the rebel battle flag.  Racism is officially over!  We can do away with the aclu and naapc and affirmative action.  /sarcasm 




 And that's the difference between men and women.  I'm a man, and I always wished some older lady wanted to take advantage of me.  From 13 till now, all I think about is seeing women naked and on my penis.  I'm 35 and have some standards now, but as a teen, those standards were A LOT lower. 

That being said, I knew a kid who's mom pimped him out to men, and I've heard of some other fucked up shit, and that's wrong.  

But an older woman that wants to have sex with teenaged boys? Sure,that woman has mental issues, but as a father I wouldn't be upset if my son was WILLINGLY hooking up with some hot older lady.  




 And people are worried about mechanics taking their cars thru a drive thru... 




 Somewhat, but you learn to understand her motivations better.  




 Fix your own car then, if you're that uptight.   




 If people's biggest worry is their mechanic taking their car out for lunch, then they have their priorities mixed up.  They should be worried about the mechanic taking short cuts or making stupid mistakes or NOT test driving it...
