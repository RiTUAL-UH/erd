 Really hoping that I'm not. 




 Human beings are fascinating. I always look at other people and wonder what theyre thinking. I think about all the things they do, and I wonder why. Why do we do the things we do? More importantly, what makes us change the things we do? How does behavior change?

After I graduated high school, I was intrigued by questions like these, and I decided that I wanted to attend college to study psychology. My parents tried as best as they could to be supportive of me, and they encouraged me to apply to as many colleges as I could. Unfortunately, I came from a fairly poor family, so most big-name schools were simply too expensive for my family to afford, regardless of whether I could get into them.

Luckily, one school sent me a letter that offered a solution to my problem. This university had a work-study program that would allow me to study psychology, while working for the school on the side in order to pay for it.

Although the school in question, Winnberg University of Science, was in a small town somewhere out in Giliman County, Colorado, I was surprised to find out that a lot of important psychology research had taken place there. Despite its size, it was a beacon for famous researchers who were studying behavior and behavioral modification, like B.F. Skinner and John B. Watson. 

I was very excited to leave my hometown behind and begin the college lifestyle. However, the university failed to say in its letter that work-study meant that the school could work me like a dog. When I got to Winnberg, I was immediately assigned to a student janitorial crew. We worked every night from 9pm to midnight, cleaning up other students messes.

During the day, I learned about behavioral science and psychology. I was even lucky enough to get into Psych 105 with the renowned Dr. Kingsman. Hes a fairly well known psychologist, and the fact that he taught at Winnberg was one of the reasons I was excited to go there. My classes that first semester were quite rigorous, so I didnt have much time for anything besides my studying and janitorial work. I cant say I was really getting much experience with the college lifestyle, but I was enjoying my time, nonetheless. 

For a while, life was pretty repetitive  I went to class at day, and cleaned up classrooms and lecture halls at night. However, towards the end of my first semester, I was given a new assignment by the head janitor, Skip.

Yer studyin psychology or something, right?

Yes sir. I replied.

Well son, I got a project you might be interested in doing then. You ever been in the sub-basement of Skinner Hall?

Skinner Hall was the building that housed the psychology department at Winnberg. It was a very old building, but the upper floors where I had class were well-kept and refurbished. I had heard people talk about how the lower floors were in bad condition, but I had never been down there, personally.

The Dean asked us to clean out the whole bottom floor of that place. I cant spare all of my guys for it, but I think it sounds like the perfect job for ya.

While I wasnt sold on the idea of cleaning out the creepy sub-basement by myself, it beat cleaning disgusting campus bathrooms. The next day, instead of meeting with the whole janitorial crew, I met Skip in the lobby of Skinner hall. He handed me an old brass key and led me to one of the elevators that ran through the building.

Alright son. Yer gonna take this key and put it in the keyhole thats to the right of all the buttons in the elevator, understand? It should take ya right to the basement.

I nodded intently and stepped into the elevator. It was an old, rickety thing. When I stepped inside, I could feel the whole thing shake and hear the metal foundation groan. I turned around the press turn the key, and I saw Skip was still standing in the door way to the elevator. 

Hey! Dont take nothin while yer down there, ya got me?

I told him I understood, and I inserted the key as the elevator doors closed. It reluctantly turned, and the elevator slowly descended deeper into the building. The elevator in Skinner hall moved very slowly, and it was almost a full minute before the doors opened in the sub-basement.

The sub-basement wasnt just in need of a good cleaning  it was absolutely disgusting. Garbage and old, broken furniture covered the floor. The whole place stank of mold and rot. The air was so damp that it was hard to breathe. It was like climbing into a sewage pipe. The worst part, was the pained sound of the air conditioner. The vents down here were clogged with dust and dirt, and the air made a constant wheezing sound as it filled the room.
The sub-basement consisted of an old hallway which led into a series of three dilapidated laboratories. I traipsed slowly through the sub-basement, taking in my surroundings. 

The most interesting of the three rooms was the smallest one, which stood at the southern end of the hallway. It was only about forty feet by forty feet. This room was full of old desks, bookshelves, and cardboard boxes, all seemingly empty and in various states of decay. One of the walls was covered in old, wooden boards, which were hanging loosely from rusted nails that hung in the wall. 

I remember thinking that the room I had entered smelled like something I recognized, but couldnt place. Like burnt fabric, or something.

The other two rooms were simply full of garbage and scrap, but this southern most room still had most of the supplies it would have needed to be used. I decided to clean the other two rooms first, since it appeared that this small room was going to be the hardest. As I was walking out of the small room, I noticed a small placard on the wall. On it, in dusty ceramic letters read:

**DR. RICHARD J. KALIVAKI**

It took me three nights to fully clean out all the garbage and broken furniture from the two larger rooms. Every night, I would haul a bunch of trash bags down into the sub-basement, fill them with crap, and bring them back up. It was painstaking work, especially in the disgusting environment of the sub-basement.
Once I had all the junk out of those two rooms, I realized that I would probably need clean the grime and filth off the floors and walls in each room with a power washer. Rather than start on that arduous task, I thought I should clean out the smaller room first, so I could power wash the whole basement at once, when the time came.

So on the fourth night, I brought a bunch of trash bags and some gloves down to the sub-basement so I could start removing the heavy furniture. Skip had instructed me to throw all of the old furniture away because it was too rotted to be of any value or use to the school.

The first thing I tried to pull out of the room was a dilapidated old desk. After a failed attempt at lifting the heavy desk, I tried to drag it out of the room. As I was pulling the old piece of shit, I bumped into a flimsy bookshelf that stood in the center of the room. The bookshelf teetered over, and crashed into a stack of cardboard boxes that was sitting against one wall. The bookshelf splintered into several pieces.

I groaned and leaned down to remove the broken pieces from on top of the shelf. As I cleared away the debris, I noticed that one of the boxes had burst open. A stack of paper had fallen out of the box onto the ground in front of me. I was intrigued, and I picked it up. The thin stack of paper was stapled together. The cover page read:

**The Bad-Wife Experiment - 1954**
**Kalivaki, Richard J.  PhD, Psychology**
**Winnberg University of Science**

My fascination with psychology immediately took over. Rather than getting back to my cleaning, or even picking up the pieces of the broken bookshelf, I sat down in one of the dilapidated chairs and flipped open the short packet. 

There was a short note paper clipped to the first page of the study. It read:

*Dr. Kalivaki,*

*The Journal of Abnormal Psychology is not willing to publish your study at this time. We find that the methods described herein violate several pieces of our Human Rights doctrine. Specifically, the objective of your experiment, as well as the methods used to achieve said objective. We apologize for the inconvenience. Please do not attempt to submit this paper again.*

*Benjamin Blackford*

*The Journal of Abnormal Psychology*

This unusual note piqued my interest even more. I unclipped the note and read the page under it.
I could tell by the handwritten script and irregular phrasing that this wasnt a normal study. It read more like a diary than an academic study. The first page began as follows:

*February 19th, 1954 - This experiment will analyze the extent to which behavior modification techniques can be used to affect a persons objectives and actions. I will be primarily employing differential reinforcement techniques on several male test subjects to measure the extent to which they can be manipulated into changing their behavior.*

I had learned about differential reinforcement in one of my classes. It consisted of giving a reinforcer or bribe when someone did something you wanted them to do, and punishing them if they did something you didnt want them to do. I kept reading.

*Ive sent out a flyer to all the married men in town, explaining that theyve been asked to take part in a study about marital satisfaction. I hoping that the flyer will pull in at least a few viable subjects for my test.
I was able to acquire a low grade chair from an acquaintance of mine who works at the jail. They should provide a sufficient aversive stimulus for the means of this experiment. The chair has been plugged in inside the experiment room. I was able to dial its power down tremendously. It should only release a mild shock, rather than a life threatening one. Im hoping its leather straps will still be able to hold my subjects*

What the fuck? I murmured quietly to myself. The writings about the electric chairs in the notes were bizarre. I assumed these notes must have been someones absurd joke, and I threw the packet back on top of one of the desks in the room.

Rather than read the strange study, I spent the next few hours cleaning up the debris I had created in the musty room. I left around 1 A.M., and returned to my dorm room. Since it was a school night, almost everyone in the dorms seemed to already be asleep. I crawled into my bed and shut my eyes tightly. I forgot quickly about the study. I assumed it was just somebodys sick joke.

 The bizarre experiment didnt cross my mind again until the elevator stopped at the sub-basement floor again, and I saw the old, yellowed packet of paper resting securely on top of one of the remaining desks.

Without hesitation, I flipped open the packet and continued reading where I had left off.

*"February 24th 1954  Ive had a great deal of responses to my message. Four different men have responded to my inquiry and will be arriving for the test over the next few days. Ive prepared all of the images for the projector. Ive decided to arrange the room as follows:"*

Below this paragraph was a hastily drawn diagram of a small room. In the room, there was a drawing of small chair labeled E.C., which I assume stands for electric chair. In front of the chair was a box labeled Projector and a spot on the wall labeled Image. Based on the drawing, the room was around 20 by 20 feet. It was smaller than Dr. Kalivakis lab. His writing continued:

 *"I was skeptical of how I would acquire the In-Pain images, but luckily, I was able to bring back a young woman to my apartment two nights ago. The pictures I took should be suitable to show a woman in pain. The first subject, Samuel Armingham, will arrive around 5pm this Friday. I will write the results of the test on Mr. Armingham then.*

*February 27th 1954  The experiment went off quite swimmingly. Mr. Armingham is certainly no worse for the wear, although one of his arms is continuing to twitch. Ive instructed him that it is a temporary side effect after his prolonged treatment, and it should last no longer than a few weeks. The treatment only lasted 18 hours. I am pleased with the limited duration it took to treat Mr. Armingham.*

*The experiment began at approximately 17:20. When Mr. Armingham arrived I instructed him to sit in the chair labeled E.C in my diagram. He was resistant at first, but yielded upon being told that he would be compensated for his time. Once in the chair, I proceeded to strap Mr. Armingham in using the provided leather straps. It is worth noting that he was able to damage one of the straps during his flailing (unfortunately, they did not hold up as I hoped.) I will make sure to reinforce them with steel cuffs during the next trial.*

*After being strapped in, Mr. Armingham was shown a projection of a woman who was smiling. I asked Mr. Armingham if this picture made him feel good or bad. His first response was good.*

*I set the dial to 25 volts and pressed the switch. Mr. Armingham reacted negatively to this jolt and protested quite loudly. I assured him it was simply part of the experiment.*

*I then showed Mr. Armingham a projection of a woman crying. I asked him if it made him feel good or bad. He responded bad.*

*I delivered a 50 volt shock to Mr. Armingham. I will have to remember to sound proof the testing room, as his scream grew quite loud after the 50 volt shock. His protests continued.*

*I showed Mr. Armingham the picture of the woman smiling again. I asked him his feelings, and he told me it made him feel bad. I did not deliver a shock, but audibly told him I was turning the electricity down to only 25 volts.*

*I then displayed the image of the In-Pain Woman. Mr. Armingham responded with disgust to the bruising and bleeding displayed on the womans face. When asked how he felt, he responded quite loudly that he felt bad.*

*I turned the dial to 150 volts of electricity and sent the shock into his body. He displayed physical signs of pain and began pleading for me to stop.*

*I continued the cycle of these pictures. I subbed in the other five pictures of an in-pain woman throughout the next several hours. After one hour, Mr. Armingham consistently answered that he felt bad about the smiling woman and good about the woman in pain. I reduced the amount of shock when he gave the correct answers. By the third hour, I only used the shock from the chair to discourage his pleadings to be allowed to go free. I continued the test through the night to verify that he was automatically correct responses. He was allowed to go free at around 11:00 Saturday morning. I will update with the long term results of my experiment."*

It was with both fascination and horror that I read the next paragraph.

*"February 25th 1954  The results of my test came quicker than I would have guessed. Mr. Armingham was arrested late last night for the murder of his wife and youngest daughter. It is my understanding that both deaths were from physical beatings with a small hammer belonging to Mr. Armingham. I believe this is a result of the pictures I showed, which clearly showed the results of physical beating. I will have to test this result. The next subject comes in tomorrow at 13:00."*

I felt sick to my stomach. I cautiously flipped through the rest of the study, which detailed the next three trials. All of them displayed similar results. The worst by far was the third trial. It began similarly, but took a different direction during the 10th hour of testing. 

*"Mr. Ternbauld had begun repeating his wifes name while pleading to be let go at around 19:00. He said phrases such as forgive me Janet! or Please, tell Janet I love her. I began repeating his wifes name, and asking him to respond with how he felt. I gave him a 150 volt shock when he said good and no shock when he said bad. This test was repeated for two hours. I was pleased to find that, by the end of the experiment, there was truly a rage in the Mr. Ternbaulds voice when he repeated his wifes name."*

All four experiments were followed up by a short entry confirming that they had been arrested for murdering or injuring their wives or other women close to them. The worst was the third, by far.

*"March 1st 1954  Im quite pleased to report that the results of Mr. Ternbaulds trial were truly pleasing. I observed on the local news, that he was arrested for murdering his wife. He apparently dismembered her with a buzz saw from their garage. Police were called by neighbors who reported a woman screaming loudly.*

*When they arrived, they found Mr. Ternbauld painting the word Janet on the wall over and over in his wifes blood. What a success!"*

I wanted to stop reading after the first trial, but I couldnt. I had such a fascination with the horrible acts described within the text that I was unable to break away from. It was like looking at a car accident. It was terrible, but I just couldnt look away.

I wont reproduce all of Dr. Kalivakis writings here, but I will tell you what he wrote at the end of the study, in response to the letter I had found at the beginning of the notes.

*"I am displeased to hear that my study has been found too scandalous for the mainstream public. Although my writings will not be published, I am pleased to recount that all four of my test subjects have been deemed too aggressive and violent towards women to be integrated back into mainstream society. My third patient, Mr. Ternbauld has actually been given the death sentence for his murder. I believe that this technique can be used to create violence against any desired subject.*

*I plan on conducting further experiments on violence and rage creation. I consider this experiment to be a complete and total success."*

I didnt remove any more of the furniture from Dr. Kalivakis old laboratory. Just the thought of returning to the place where he wrote about his horrifying tests made my stomach turn. I told Skip that I was sick, and would be unable to continue clearing out the test room. He assigned another janitor to the sub-basement in Skinner hall, who was able to clear out the furniture in two or three days.

I leaned sometime after that, while moving the furniture out of the room, the substitute janitor decided he would remove the old boards that were covering one of the walls. Behind them, he found a small room with only two pieces of furniture in it  an old projector and a broken down electric chair. 

I considering switching majors after learning about Dr. Kalivakis fucked up tests. But after a relaxing winter vacation and a strenuous second semester at Winnberg, I forgot about what I read in that musty sub-basement.

I continued taking classes with Dr. Kingsman, and he became a kind of mentor for me. I ended up working on a few research papers with him and I took every class he offered. Almost everything Ive learned in college Ive learned from him. As college went on, I was able to find some more free time to have a social life. College has definitely improved for me. I was so busy with classes, friends, and work, that I hadnt thought about Dr. Kalivaki or his twisted experiment at all.

Until a few days ago, anyway.

I had been invited to go to an awards banquet with Dr. Kingsman, where one of the papers Id helped with was going to be presented. A myriad of distinguished psychologists and researchers were going to be there and I thought it would be an excellent chance to network.

The evening went very well. Our paper was received very well, and I spoke to quite a few psychologists about possible employment opportunities. After gulping down a few platefuls of cheap banquet food, I began leaving the over-crowded auditorium.

Before I could get out the door, a familiar voice called out my name. I turned and saw Dr. Kingsman standing next to an elderly man in a wheelchair

Jeremy! Before you leave, there is someone Id like you to meet!
I walked over to Dr. Kingsman and held out my hand to shake the old mans hand. Dr. Kingsman introduced me to the man.

This is Jeremy. He is one of my very best students, and he conducted almost all the data entry for the paper I was recognized for today.

I had just begun shaking the mans hand when Dr. Kingman introduced him to me. His wrinkled face remained emotionless the whole time. 

Jeremy, this man was my mentor when I was an undergraduate. Almost everything youve learned comes from something this man taught me. Youre practically one of his students! His name is Richard Kalivaki.

All of a sudden, everything Id read in that cramped sub-basement came rushing back.

I was shaking hands with Dr. Kalivaki. I was shaking hands with a man who strapped men into an electric chair and tortured them for hours.

I was shaking hands with the man who caused four husbands to violently kill their wives.

I was shaking hands with a psychopath. A psychopath who essentially taught me everything I know.

I cant get the emotionless face of that old man out of my head. I cant stop thinking of the horrible things that man did, and how theyve influenced my thoughts and actions.

But most of all, I cant stop thinking of the last sentences of Dr. Kalivakis notes:

*"I plan on conducting further experiments on violence and rage creation. Overall, I consider this experiment to be a complete and total success.*"

 Ive known Brett as long as I can remember. Honestly, hes been one of my best friends, all of my life. When we were kids, he lived just a couple houses down from me on my street. Brett and I used to hang out at each others houses all the time growing up. 

Usually, we would go to my house and play videogames on the Xbox. If that got boring, we would go to Bretts house and play pranks on his older sister. She was just a year older than us, and we loved messing with her.

I remember one time, while Bretts sister was downstairs helping his mom with the laundry, Brett and I snuck into her room, and found all her Barbie dolls. I thought it would be funny if we hid them somewhere in her room. But Brett had a better idea. He took all of her favorite Barbies, and he ripped the heads off of them. Brett thought jokes like that were funny. Bretts mom didnt think this one was funny at all. Brett got grounded for over a month, and when my mom found out what we had done, I got grounded as well. 

As we grew up, Brett and I stayed close friends. We went to the same elementary school, middle school, and high school. Even though Bretts parents moved across town when we were in second grade, they made sure Brett was able to go to the same school as me. Part of me thinks it was because I was Bretts only real friend. 

Well, his only real friend, except for Sammy, that is. I didnt really know Sammy, but Brett talked about him a lot. The first I heard about Sammy was when we were in second grade. Brett first brought him up about a week after he and his family had moved across town. He told me that Sammy lived in his new neighborhood, and that they had played videogames at Bretts house the weekend before. 

Usually, Brett only hung out with Sammy if I was unavailable. If I had to go to see my grandparents some weekend, Brett would be having a sleepover with Sammy that Saturday. If I couldnt come over to Bretts house after school, then Brett and Sammy would go down to the creek by Bretts house. I didnt really mind, because Brett still hung out with me quite a bit.

Brett had a harder time making friends as the years went on. He and I always got along great, but he never got along with the other kids at school. When we were in elementary school, it was a real problem, because Brett didnt want to hang out with anybody besides Sammy or I. Whenever I would invite him over to play videogames or watch movies with some of our classmates, he would say he couldnt make it because he had already made plans with Sammy.

Around the time that I started 5th grade, I had found a pretty good group of friends who were into the same kind of things that Brett and I were, like videogames and Pokmon cards. But no matter how many times I tried to convince Brett that he would get along well with my new friends, he refused. He said he didnt need any more friends. He told me that he didnt have anything in common with them, or that they were jerks, or some other excuse. 

One day, when I complained to my mom that Brett wouldnt hang out with anybody but Sammy or I, she told me that Brett must still be going through a rough time after his parents move. She told me that he probably needed a friend right now, and that I should be respectful if he didnt want to be friends with anyone else. She also said that I could still be friends with other people, as long as I still tried to be friends with Brett.

I was bummed out that Brett wasnt willing to make any new friends, but I did what my mom said. I stayed friends with Brett even though he wouldnt hang out with any other classmates. 
Even a couple of years later, in middle school, Brett was still kind of a loner. He and I still spent plenty of time together, but he still wasnt interested in being friends with anyone else. Except for Sammy of course. Brett talked about Sammy all the time.

At first, he just told me the same old stuff about Sammy  that he and Sammy hung out down in the creek by Bretts house, that Sammy and him were going to beat the new Halo game that weekend, things like that. But around the time we turned thirteen, Brett started to tell me things about Sammy that were disturbing. Once, during our homeroom class, I was working on a math assignment that was due during my next class period, when Brett leaned over and whispered something to me.

Sammy and I are going to skin a rabbit this weekend!

I was caught off guard by what Brett had said. What? I murmured, startled.

Shh! Sammy came up with the idea. Were going to catch a rabbit down in the creek, and then were going to kill it with a rock or something, and then were going to skin it!

I didnt really know what to say. I thought that it was messed up to kill a poor rabbit. Brett didnt really see the problem with it. He just kept saying Its not like its a person!

Over the next year or so, Brett only brought up Sammy sparingly, 
and when he did, it was always some strange thing that Sammy had suggested they do. It was usually just cruel pranks, like putting firecrackers in peoples mailboxes, or breaking his neighbors windows while they were asleep. But sometimes, Brett and Sammy did really bad stuff, like hurting and killing animals.

One day in the eighth grade, Brett came to school with a big cut in the shape of a B on his right bicep. The cut had formed a bloody scab and it was beginning to scar over. I asked him 

Whats that from?

Sammy carved it on my arm with his dads pocket knife. Isnt it awesome?

I didnt think it was cool. It scared me. 

Brett, I dont think you should let Sammy do that kind of thing to you. Its kinda weird, ya know?

Brett turned red. His brow furrowed and he turned away from me.

You sound just like my mom. Sammy said you wouldnt understand. Brett stomped away. He wasnt in homeroom that day.

After that day, Brett and I grew distant. We still hung out sometimes, but Brett didnt talk much. By the time we got to high school, I only saw Brett occasionally.

It kind of sucked, but I never thought about it much because I still ran with the same group of kids I had met in the 5th grade. I spent a lot of time with those guys, and apart from the occasional nod or wave in the halls, Brett and I didnt see each other anymore. 

About the time we stopped talking, Brett started getting picked on. I dont think it had anything to do with him and me not speaking anymore. I think some jock just noticed Brett didnt have any friends, and decided that hed be an easy target for abuse. 
Sooner or later, the whole football team started picking on Brett.

Brett wasnt really fat or skinny, and he wasnt ugly or dirty. He dressed alright, and he wasnt too dumb or too smart. Brett didnt have the usual qualities that led to getting picked on at that age. But he was quiet and pale, and he kept to himself. The football players in question took to calling him things like The Pedophile or Mr. Creeper. 

It wasnt uncommon for Brett to get the books knocked out of his hands while walking through the hallway to class. It wasnt uncommon to hear Hey, Mr. Creeper, kill anybody lately? yelled across the common area.  It wasnt uncommon for Brett to have bruises or a black eye when some asshole thought that they should show dominance.

I wish I had stepped in or something. I didnt talk to Brett back then, but I knew it was happening. I wish I had said something. I wish I had told them to stop. But kids can be pretty shitty, and I didnt want to get picked on because I stood up for him. Maybe that makes me a bad guy, but, like I said, kids can be pretty shitty.

Brett hadnt said as much as Hello to me in almost three years when he sat with me in the library. It was March, and I was trying pretty hard to pull my grades up, because I would be applying to college in the fall. I was poring over a physics lab that was due during the next period when I suddenly heard the chair across from me pull out. I looked up and the same pale face that I had spent countless hours with as a kid. He had dark bags under his eyes, which were bloodshot. 

Hey, hows it going? 

Hey man. Im good. Howre you? I feel like I havent talked to you in ages.

Yeah man, no kidding. Im doing pretty good too! I saw you sitting here, and I thought I should say whats up!

Cool. How have you been Brett? Its been so long

Bretts gaze turned away from my face, and towards the table, where he was picking at one of his nails.

Ive been okay. He laughed nervously. High school has been a little rough, but Im surviving.

I immediately felt a twinge of guilt for not standing up for him all this time. I knew what he meant when he said high school was rough. I stared quietly at my physics homework, trying to think of something to say.

I miss hanging out with you. Brett blurted out, suddenly. Brett had looked up from his hands and was staring at me. His face turned bright red, fairly quickly. 

Yeah man. I miss hanging out with you too. I dont know what happened. Life just got in the way I guess. I answered, laughing awkwardly.

Its okay. Maybe we could hang out again sometime soon, though? 

Sure Brett. Thatd be cool.

All of sudden, Brett perked up and smiled. What are you doing this Friday night? 

Uhh, Im not sure. Why, did you have something planned?

 Yeah! Sammy and I are going to this party at Ryan Ruveys house! You should come with us.

The thought of Brett attending a party was a strange one, given his loner status. What was really confusing, however, was that he claimed the party was at Ryan Ruveys house. I had heard early that week that Ryans parents were out of town, so he was throwing a huge party. But Ryan wasnt exactly Bretts friend. Ryan was one of the football players who had made Bretts high school career a living hell. I couldnt help thinking of the time Ryan had taped a white sign on Bretts locker that said Mr. Creepers fag-box. I couldnt help thinking of how Brett was almost crying as he pulled the thing off his locker while Ryan and his buddies laughed nearby.

Uhh, I didnt know you were friends with Ryan. 

Brett was still smiling  Sammy knows him! He says if I go and get to know those guys, we might end up getting along better.

I have to admit, I was a bit annoyed that Sammy had been the one to finally convince Brett to branch out and find new friends, rather than me, but I was more concerned than anything. I saw the way those guys treated Brett. I assumed they had something horrible planned for Brett and Sammy. I decided I should go with him, to make sure they were alright. 

I got the address and time from Brett, and I told him I would try to meet him and Sammy at the party. Right as Brett started to leave, the bell for our next class rang.

See you Friday, dude. Brett looked the happiest Id seen him in years.

Yeah man, see you then. I was hesitant about going to the party, but I didnt want to hurt Bretts feelings. I started to walk away from my table in the library. 

Hey August! Brett yelled, from behind me.

Yeah?

Youre my best friend, you know that right?

I didnt know what to say. I yelled See you Friday man! and walked quickly out of the library.

I wish I had said more. I really do.

When Friday came, I was growing more and more hesitant about going to the party. My concern about the joke that could be pulled on Brett and Sammy was slowing turning to concern that said joke would affect me as well. 

I still had Bretts number from when we were kids. I sent Brett a text that said:

Hey dude, Im feeling kind of sick. Dont think Ill be able to make the party tonight. Maybe instead we can hang tomorrow?

Brett replied:

 Thats ok. Lets grab breakfast tomorrow, at the Waffle House by your house?

Sounds good, see you at 12!

I felt bad for bailing on Brett, but I knew that the party wasnt going to go well. I was right.

When I saw Brett at breakfast the next day, he looked paler and more tired than he had been the other day. But he was smiling as I walked into the Waffle House. He had already gotten a table, and was drinking from a mug of coffee. As I approached the table, I could see his hands were shaking slightly, as he sipped on the coffee.

Hey man, whats up? 

Hey. Feelin better? Brett asked.

Yeah. Just a 24 hour bug, I guess. How was the party?

Brett didnt answer. He just smiled.

Was Sammy still able to go with you? I asked.

Yeah, he was there. Brett was still smiling. His eyes were bloodshot. Brett started to say something else, but we heard a car door slam outside. Brett turned his head towards the window on his left. I looked out the window and saw a Giliman County police cruiser parked neatly next to his car.

Sorry August. I guess I dont have very much time.

What?

You really are my best friend, August.

An officer had just entered Waffle House. He was quickly approaching our table, and drawing his gun at the same time. I was still processing what Brett had said when the officer grabbed my arm and pulled me to the ground.

Brett had indeed gone to Ryan Ruveys house the night before. Neither he, nor Sammy, had actually been invited. He showed up to the house, which was full of drunken football players and their friends. There was about 23 people, in all.
Nobody noticed Brett for almost 20 minutes. Sometime around 10, Ryan noticed Brett standing idly in his kitchen, right beside the beer keg, watching everyone. He yelled 

Hey look everybody, its the serial killer! Who invited you, faggot? 
Brett didnt answer Ryan. He just smiled. Brett had brought along a gun that his dad kept in their garage. Brett fired twice at Ryan, then began firing into the crowd of people. 

After Brett had expended all eight shots, he reloaded and fired eight more times. He ended up killing twelve people. The rest escaped while Brett was firing.

It took the police all night to track Brett down. I just happened to get to Waffle House a few minutes before they did.

They arrested Brett, and took us both in for questioning. Two officers questioned me extensively about Brett. I told them what I knew, and they told me what Brett had done the night before. Afterwards, they asked me if I had any questions. I did.

Did Brett shoot Sammy?

The officers looked at each other blankly. One of them quickly flipped through their notes.

No. No one reported to be at the party was named Sammy. One of them told me. 

I didnt understand. Why had Brett told me Sammy was there, if he wasnt? I told the cops that I had never met Sammy, but I had heard a lot about him from Brett.

Nobody else that the cops questioned had heard of a Sammy. 

Except for Bretts parents, that is. I was allowed to watch several police questionings, in case something I heard might jog my memory. When asked if Brett knew anyone named Sammy, Bretts parents looked confused.

Brett used to have a friend named Sammy when he was a little boy, but not since then. His mom told officers. 

The officers looked surprised. Do you have any idea where that Sammy might live now?

Bretts Mom frowned. Well no. Sammy wasnt real. Sammy was Bretts imaginary friend. He pretended to play with Sammy when he was real little. Whenever he misbehaved, he would tell us that whatever he had done was Sammys idea. We told Brett he couldnt be friends with Sammy if he was going to get him into trouble. I havent heard anything about him, since.

My heart sank when she said that. No one but me had heard anything about a Sammy since Brett was a little kid. There was no record of a Sammy living in the area around Brett. 

There never was a Sammy. All of those things that Brett did. All of the times he said he was with Sammy. He was by himself. 

I cringe when I think about Sammy. To think that Sammy was real to Brett. To think that Brett heard Sammy talking to him, telling him to do those awful things.

Brett died in jail after taking a handful of painkillers he had purchased from another prisoner. He died peacefully in his sleep. The last few times I had seen him, he looked like he hadnt slept in days. I think it was Sammy was keeping him awake. I hope he can finally rest now.

Goodbye Brett. You were always my best friend too.

 Maybe it's because I'm a college student in a town with a lot of bars, but I find this quite freaky. 




 Guess pooping is out of the question for OP now.
