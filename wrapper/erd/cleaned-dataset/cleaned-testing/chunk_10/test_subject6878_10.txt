 Frag, your sarcasm is quite hilarious, but you're missing my point, and inventing another. I didn't say anything about the game needing to be "happy fun time." I understand that there will be bandits. It's the fact that the zombies are completely unimportant to these guys. In a real *zombie* apocalypse, yes, there would be bandits, and people battling each other, but they'd have to account for the zombies. How is this not obvious? 




 I understand what you're saying quake, but the game is a zombie sandbox for a reason. Am I wrong? These firefights are interesting to be a part of I'm sure, but the guy has a zombie right on top of him eating him and he basically ignores it. How is that not ruining the game? He isn't playing it how it was intended to be played. 




 I'm inclined to agree. When you take out the zombies you just revert to Arma. It's so boring that way. These players are the kind of people that ruin the game. It's a zombie mod, not a new map for arma.

Edit: Reddiquette says don't downvote if someone disagrees with your opinion. Why are you downvoting because I'm expressing my opinion? 




 After watching every season of gossip girl it makes me think that if we were born with a trust fund we would have grown up differently, and choose different paths then we are on now.

That said, someone said something about college. I can hardly afford it now. I would never have to worry about tuition again, and i would just learn. Then use that knowledge for society. 

At least that's what i say. I don't know what i would do of i *actually* had money. 




 I have to disagree with him (PREPARE THE DOWNVOTE CANNONS) because grades are extremely important when it comes to scholarships for me. I have to maintain at least a 3.2 for one of my scholarships, and a 3.5 for another. Kids will complain that teachers will test over something they didn't cover, and usually it's just the dumbass kid not paying attention, but I've experienced it myself. I write down every word the professor says and everything he writes on the board. Sometimes you get a bad professor who actually does not test over what he teaches. Also, this is just for me personally, but when I get bad grades when I work extremely hard not to, I get extremely down trodden, and I feel like I'm in the wrong major. Grades are very, very important to me, because if I lose my scholarships, I lose not only my education but my apartment as well, and then I would have to live with my parents, and nobody wants that!

I understand hand outs are the bane of the education system, but for the people who actually do study hard for the grade, then get shafted due to poor test questions, I can also understand the frustration and anger. Luckily, as I get farther into my degree, I'm escaping the graduate students who are only copying a paper to the board and have no idea what they're talking about. This professor sounds like he thinks he knows everything, which would be frustrating as well. Especially that term "mommified." That's very unfair to the single moms or even the ones who aren't who work extremely hard to raise their kids right. 

Quick edit: I do have the ability to think by the way. We are given concepts and we have to think of how they work and where they came from. Even these things aren't on the tests sometimes. I'm in engineering, so that may be part of it. 




 Like World Globetrotter said, they do this on purpose, not to save money, but to be convenient. That way students only have to take the section or chapter they are reviewing in class. 




 Thanks for the help. I'll just keep it as a novelty and get a new USB if I need one.

The first one is pointless but I'm adding it anyway. It just shows what I get when I am at the storage tab. Clicking Disk Management gives me the second image. I opened the disk's properties window in case you needed that. I have the option to change drive letter and paths in case that's important. Thanks for the help so far!

Also, the disk is slightly transparent in the first image if you look at the My Computer window. Idk if that is relevant. 




 Thanks for the reply, but it won't let me format it.

When I try it says "There is no disk in drive G:. Insert a disk, and then try again."  




 I couldn't tell you. This is the first I've plugged it in, and I can't change the formatting and it doesn't tell me when I check the properties. 




 It has never been used so it should be empty.

Yes, it is very awesome!

Anddd Yes. I tried every port on my motherboard and the two quick access ports on the front of my case. No dice. :\ 




 I'm using [this USB drive](http://www.amazon.com/Nerf-USB-Flash-Drive-16056/dp/B005G7BFLK). When I plug it in, it shows up as Removable Disk (G:) under "Devices with Removable Storage." When I attempt to open the drive it says, "Please insert a disk into Removable Disk (G:)."

Is there a way to make my computer recognize it as a USB drive? I need a drive formatted to Fat32 so I can transfer PS3 save files.

Btw, a friend bought it for me. And it's all I have so I'm using it. 




 Of course man! I'm going through some tough things with a girl myself and it makes me feel great to know I'm not alone. We all suffer in some way or another, but if we stick together we can get through these things. I'm growing used to relationships being the way they are, but I look at the many people who have great, lasting marriages rather than those who are single or are divorced.

The darker side may look more prominent but at least there is a bright side. 




 This story was awesome and really cheered me up for the first half. I know the ending is completely awful, but reading the first half made me feel like their is some awesome things in this world when you disregard the bad (I know that isn't easy). I'm not telling you to just ignore what happened with that girl. I get incredibly low when this kind of things happens to me. But you always have those things to be proud of.

Music was my thing for a long time. I was in a band, produced an EP. Things were going good. Then, I had to go to college (because lets face it, the band wasn't going anywhere), and my dad wouldn't pay for college if it meant I was going for anything music (btw, he is a good dad, he just knows that I had no chance). I'm very jealous of your life right now driving the car you drive and being in a successful band.

I hate when people tell me to look at the silver lining when I'm angry or feeling down, but I know it's the best thing to do. 




 I've played Battlefield 3 since day one and stuck through it all until now, and I just can't bring myself to play it anymore. The poor design of the game due to the excessive destruction done by the patches has killed it for me, utterly.

- I know Warfighter uses Frostbite.
- I hate Call of Duty.
- I play shooters with a clan.

Those qualities defined, what is your take on Warfighter? Is it something I should check out? 




 This is old news I'm sure, but I can't find anything on Google to help me. I have that damn copy of Glories and Laments and I want it out of my inventory. I can't turn in the copy I own to Urag and it's extremely frustrating.

**I'm playing on PS3.**

Is there no fix to this? I'm majorly OCD so when I have things there that I can't clean up it makes me want to break my disc in half. Can anyone help me? 




 This would make it more difficult. 




 I mean, I can see how it would be easy to kill a lot of people with that method, but a million? That's quiet a bit more than 100. 




 You guys freak me out. I know I asked the weird question, but damn. 




 Dude, my neighborhood doesn't even have 500,000 people in it. How are you going to take out that many? 




 This is what I was thinking. Kind of a scary thought. If someone was willing, they could do this pretty well, assuming that each kill went relatively smoothly. 




 Someone asked me this once. 




 I dropped a TV off of an elevated platform on accident while working at Best Buy. The glass didn't shatter, but the TV didn't work. Some people are just really, really stupid. (~~We are all looking at you, iPhone psychofanatics~~)

Edit: You are actually all looking at me for being stupid and dropping the TV. Great.. 




 It's really just for the fun of seeing what I get. I collect them, I don't battle with them.

BTW WHY THE FUCK AM I BEING DOWNVOTED. READ THE DAMN REDIQUETTE ASSHOLES. 




 Agreed. I'm 20 and I'm buying new sleeves to replace the damaged ones. New boosters all day, every day. 




 I can see how you would make that mistake. 




 Lighting is huge in games like this. They should take notes from Splinter Cell on how to handle it. You should be more visible in the light, and there should be more light. 




 I prefer to not use the gamma trick, but you *have* to do it on some servers unless you like being able to see only when you're walking with your flashlight up. They could make it so that you can point your flashlight forward while running. Real people in real life can do it. 




 We'll get it eventually I'm sure! I feel it's best to have something to look forward to
