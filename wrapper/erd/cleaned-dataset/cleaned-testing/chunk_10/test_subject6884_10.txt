 Hi Guys,
Has anyone managed to get NFC working with a door access system? I've tried but it seems the phone generates a random hex everytime NFC is used. In order to use your phone to access a building for example this code would need to be static. Has anyone heard of any apps that do this? I have read that card emulation is build into the NFC API but as of yet I can't find anything? 




 5 times too many! 




 With that tiger claw thing and now this, Hull are officially the most cringe team in football!

 I'm still hoping that the 2022 World Cup won't be played in Qatar at all.  




 Something like - " can we please stop posting nonsense like this to this subreddit"

 I have a set of B W Dm601 S2's that are in need of a new amp. Currently these are powered by an Nakimitchi AV-10 that provides more than enough power to drive these speakers. However this amp will now be moving to the lounge to become part of a fully fledged home cinema system.

This leaves these great speakers with nothing to power them. I'm looking for something that will compliment them well and cost under 150.

 I'm a very placid guy and wouldn't usually say boo to a goose, however when i'm on my bike I unleash hell on careless drivers and frequently use some very colourful language. Am I on my own here?
