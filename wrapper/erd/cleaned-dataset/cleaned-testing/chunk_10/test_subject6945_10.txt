 Holy shit thats pretty cool, i use to live in the next town over and i still have family there.  




 Thats it! Maybe i should have been more specific,  people might think im ripping on a kid for bad hand writing :/  









 No chance. I went to the last rally more so as a spectator, and the behavior on both sides of the rally was disgusting. 

I saw counter protesters assaulting and spitting on people.  

I also saw the reclaim Australia people screaming racial slurs and trying to intimidate people in smaller groups. 

Honestly it was an embarrassment to say the least. Both sides should be ashamed of themselves. Neither were proving anything except that people are arseholes no matter what side of the argument they are on.       




 Don't be a cunt.  




 Sorry to hear that mate. Wont be able to make the meet but good luck with everything in the future :)  




 Ok maybe i should have read the article. the thumbnail pissed me off i didnt even read it haha  




 What a fucking idiot. How is this a positive image for vaping?  




 Pink carousel from the vaper caper. i have a bottle steeping now. Its taking a whole new level of self control not to fill my lungs with  that sweet sweet pinky goodness.  




 Accidentally dry humped my cat the other morning. Jumped into bed after i finished a 12 hour night shift, and for some reason im always super horny when i get into bed after these night shifts. 

Anyway i snuggle up to my sleeping partner and try to wake her with a gentle grind.. After about 2 minutes i hear a faint meow. I lift my leg and look under the blanket to see my poor indy with a horrified look on her face. 

Poor little fucker.  




 Yeah a solicitor may be a bit drastic. I may as well see what the agent says, he might be feeling generous and get someone to check it out haha.  




 Haha we tried that. Full blast and it still does fuck all  




 Be as pedantic as possible in the inspection. There has been a few things we found after moving in that you just wouldn't think to look at! The ovan being the major one so if this is the worst of it then i can complain too much. Good luck!
