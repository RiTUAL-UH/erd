 So, me and a friend did some math to determine the age of "Shermy". 

The baby seen during the Stan twins' senior year is anywhere from 0-2. Both of the Pines are likely 18. 

Now, Dipper and Mabel are 12. This means, since the show is set in 2012, they were born in 2000. This allows us to pin some time quick:

-The author hasn't been himself for 30 years, meaning Ford was lost in the portal in 1982. 
-Stanley said they hadn't seen each other in ten years before entering the shack, meaning that they were seniors in 1972, and they were then both 28. 
-Little sidestep, this means that Ford and Lee are currently 58, and were born in 1954. 
-The baby, who we're assuming is Shermy, is 10-12 by the time Ford gets in the portal (1982). 
-By 2000,  "Shermy" is 28-30. Not grandpa age. 

So either Shermy's got hella mojo, that's not their grandpa, or "Grunkle" is an affectionate term, making them actually just uncles. 

Appreciate any input! 




 Bill Cipher amiibo or bust.  









 At my local tournaments, there happens to be a SSB4 Peach main. He won both doubles, and one singles. The only reason he didn't make it to singles the second time was he left early. 

Hundreds fear him, and his tag. The one known as PeachBooty.  




 No problem, I'll just continue my search then. Thanks! 




 Well, slight problem, my store just sold the last Silver Mario before I got there. Sorry, man. 

EDIT: They do have SMB Toad and Bowser, though. If you need either of them for the Pit, I'll take the offer.  




 Silver Mario NIB for Robin, Pit or Ike?  




 "That sounds like something normal parents wouldn't allow you to do. Good thing I'm a Crystal Gem. AVENGE YOUR MOTHER, KID! AVENGE HERRRRR!" 




 Both Doom (616) and Vader (Between V-VI) are interested in expanding their empire, and unknowingly, both have targeted the same five kingdoms:

1. Snow White's Cottage
2. Sleeping Beauty's Castle
3. Cinderella's Castle
4. Elsa's Ice Castle
5. Ariel's Undersea Kingdom

Each has access to their generic army of Doombots and Stormtroopers, respectively, and their usual powers / weapons. In order for one to win, they must kill the other, and all five princesses must be dead. Their army cannot kill any of the targets, solely Doom and Vader can. They travel by air (Doom has a jet, Vader a TIE Fighter), but cannot kill anyone using the vehicle's weapons. No access to any planet-destroying weapons, solely what they keep on them for personal combat. 

Each Disney princess has their supporting cast with them:

Snow White: The Seven Dwarves, her Prince, woodland creatures

Sleeping Beauty: Fairies, Prince Phillip, woodland creatures

Cinderella: 
Prince Charming, animal servants, could summon Fairy Godmother when crying

Elsa: Anna, Olaf, the reindeer guy, his reindeer, the snow monster

Ariel: Sebastian, Flounder


Will either be able to conquer each kingdom and destroy their competition? 




 Let's stretch our legs! 




 Autobots, Rollout! 

Present the Puff!

 I feel like an eventual update could allow for players to choose between Inkling and Octoling, with their hair color changing accordingly. 




 I'm definitely interested! My priorities are Jiggly, Charizard, Greninja, Lucina and Robin, but I can always go to /r/amiiboSwap and help others get what they need with whichever of these are extras for me. Thank you for the opportunity!  




 IMO, he's one of the sole all-stars left to add in. With a new game coming out and being important enough to receive an amiibo, I think Chibi-Robo is a great choice.  




 This is something I personally really want to see in the game. 

While I have the Splatoon amiibos, it feels like there's a lot left to desire with them. Compared to other games with exclusive amiibo, Splatoon's addition feels more like hidden challenges than extra support. Something I'd like to see is *amiibo costumes*.

Like Mario Kart 8 / Kirby  the Rainbow Curse / Yoshi's Wooly World, I'd like to see certain amiibo unlock new gear for your character to wear, with special effects. Ideally, there'd be 2-3 pieces of gear locked to an amiibo, and perhaps some kind of re-skin on a weapon, sharing stats with another weapon. Say, perhaps, you have a Samus amiibo. Scanning it in gives you her Helmet (with the Bomb Sniffer ability), the Varia Suit (Defense Up), the Varia Boots (Ink Resistance) and a Arm Cannon designed Charger (with Burst Bombs and a Bubbler). 

There's several characters that could really be interesting additions (Mario costume w/F.L.U.D.D. please), and allow for a larger variety of opponents, and more incentive on purchasing amiibos.  




 Grandpa waited in line at GameStop for me, picked up my pre-order of Splatoon alongside Ness, Wario and Pac-Man, and is dropping them off during my lunch hour. I'm so happy, I thought I missed my chance to grab Ness at MSRP.  




 TIFU by letting my friends see I posted this on Reddit.  




 Minding my own business, listening to music and working on my essay in chemistry, my friend pokes me and points out a video. Watching it, I realize he's the interviewee in the video. I reply "Holy shit!" 

My music droned out the fact I yelled this. It's bad when the teacher has to hold back laughing. 

 




 The Disney Infinity series. 

Not because I don't like it, or the figures are pricey, more the fact that it becomes outdated a year later. May end up selling at least one of them when Disney Infinity 3.0 comes out.  




 I've been dealing with this crap for a while now, and I've been fairly silent about it until now. 

Flashback to 8th grade, May 2013. I had everything going for me. I was in high classes for the majority of my courses, just got accepted into the National Junior Honor Society, plenty of friends, a plan for the future, and a loving family. I had some procrastination issues, but otherwise I was an A/B student. Then I got the news that my grandma was sent to the hospital, and the outcome was, most likely, death. I took it badly, shaking and crying. My grandma and grandpa were like a second home for me, I went there after school and did work there, played with their dogs, and had a lot of good memories over there. The idea of not seeing her anymore was devastating, and I was using it to push myself further to make her proud. I finished the year with a high GPA, got into high classes for my freshman year and continued to do things I loved. A slight addiction to Nintendo and the (then-upcoming) Smash Bros. for Wii U helped push through and give me something to look forward to. 

As the time went by, my grandma went from near-death to surviving. A few amputations on her leg later, she bounced from nursing home to nursing home. Grandpa, meanwhile, stayed at their house with the dogs, taking care of it and such, a lot more carefree and "fun" than usual. We'd visit him often, mostly over the weekends, and we'd also go to the nursing home every other night or so to see my grandma. While she remained the person I loved, I saw a more bitter side to her. She was constantly whining about how she's trapped here, and I always felt guilty, for no real reason. I'd led to her getting injuries when I was little, but it wasn't what she was struggling with then.

Time went by, little by little, soon freshman year was almost over. I had finished with decent grades, as was expected, and had made a lot of new friends, alongside signing up for AP European History and such. Then came the phone call that changed my life. I was sitting at home, sick from school, both parents at work and my little brother at school. I got a call from my grandma, still in her nursing home, about two weeks from her release back home to resume normal life. She was in tears, asking for my mom. When I  told her they were at work, she began to cry harder. I had no idea what was happening, and had to ask what had happened. Apparently, my grandpa had just called her. He was divorcing her. Before I could call my mom, grandpa called. He ranted about how he was doing "the right thing" and that everything was going to be better now. 

What a fucking liar. 

After having to call both mom and dad to explain what was happening, I couldn't do anything but sit there and cry. I was freaking out, I didn't know what to do. Once they got home and settled me down, my mom made the decision to help my grandma move into her house, and stay with her for a few weeks to help get her back into where she used to be. My sole mission was to keep my little brother out of the action, and ensure he wasn't affected by any of the bullcrap that was happening. Yet, there was a huge part of me that was trying to fix things. The family was falling apart, and people were constantly yelling and freaking out. I was left in the middle, trying to solve things that I now know was impossible. 

As time passed, my brother and I (and our dog) moved in with mom and grandma, as weeks became about 2 months. We'd stay there for a while until grandma was capable of living on her own. Nurse visits, trips to the hospital, screaming phone arguments, everything was just guilting me even more. I became more involved online through Smashboards (a Smash Bros. forum), made friends there, got really high in the ranks and became part of a group of "the best of the best". People really liked me there, it was an escape from the life I was beginning to fear. Fanfictions, video games, developing video games, speculating them, I was engulfed in this world and slowly leaving my own. 

Truths began to unravel. My grandpa had been cheating on my grandma since my mom got pregnant with me. Trips to the gym, attempts to "become healthier" were all a ruse to impress this other woman. We found porn, condoms, lube, the whole nine yards in the house.  Soon, we went from a 2-week stay to the entire summer, with our bus routes picking us up at my grandma's place. 

I started our sophomore year pretty well, with the exception of AP Euro, which I couldn't focus in. Managed a 3.0 GPA by end of first semester. Home life, on the other hand, was terrible. Constant fights, dealing with grandpa's shit, the constant barking of her dogs, who went from being adorable playmates to terrorizing little shits, etc. At one point, my grandpa tried to take us to court and get custody over me and my brother, as my parents were "incapable and horrible at raising us". It sucked. 

Now, sophomore year is nearly over. I am failing nearly all of my classes. I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, and I'm taking 20mg of anti-depressants each night. I can't concentrate, and my addiction to Smash Bros. and it's world has become destructive. I've stopped caring about things, my future, my friends, nothing but trying to escape the real world. Each night, I'm doing plenty of chores, taking care of all three dogs, taking care of dinner occasionally, sometimes trying to do schoolwork and spending the rest of the time on Imgur, Skype and Reddit, browsing for no true reason. My mom is smoking a pack a day, and, when she's not working, is laying in bed feeling sick. My grandma is wheeling around, being demanding and yelling at us about stupid crap that doesn't matter. She attempted to stab my mother with a fork because my grandma took a burger from us and tried to feed it to the dogs, and when my mom tried to stop her, my grandma yelled that "she's trying to help the only ones that matter to her." My brother is remaining oblivious to most of it,  thankfully, but is glued to his Kindle and spends most of the time avoiding his work, making me do it. Dad's at work and only sees us occasionally, and that's driving him mad, and grandpa's with his significant other, doing what he pleases and being cheap on us. I've contemplated suicide once or twice, but I've never acted on it because I know it will only cause more pain to my family. 

I'm nearly at the point of giving up. I can't do anything anymore without causing someone trouble. None of my friends really try to help, and my family's attempts to help me have failed. I'm becoming violent, and beginning to obsess over stupid things like those little Nintendo amiibo figures. My life is a mess, and I have no way of escape anymore. Collecting and buying the figures gives me moments of false happiness, as does playing video games. My family is constantly fighting, and I can't do anything to fix it. 

I just can't do anything right, and I'm done with it. I don't know what to do with myself anymore.
