 What I don't understand is why so many people are so eager to be aggressors. I mean, look at all the facts and avoid war at all costs, right? Even lower- and middle-class people get behind these aggressive ideas (people who have absolutely nothing to gain from war). It's disheartening. 









 Why aren't employers punished for hiring illegals then, instead of the illegals just trying to make a living? 




 I keep seeing "illegal is illegal" and "they have to follow the law just like everyone else" as rebuttals to sympathizers of illegal immigrants. That's nonsense. Maybe the problem *IS* the law. Slavery was once legal, soooo

Not to mention the fact that many immigrants are just trying to survive and we have all these right-wing assholes obsessed with deportation and protecting the Mexican border (also nonsense).

Only argument I can maybe understand is that illegal immigration facilitates more criminal activity? By allowing criminals into the country? I think "it hurts our economy" is also another argument, but how? On the grand scale, how?

Someone please explain the mindset to me. 




 Best show ever. 




 ok thanks 




 How can it take 2-3 months to do toxicology? 




 Even cash transactions, transactions made by younger people, and attending events. The idea would probably be to keep everyone "safer." Government and larger companies would have the most to gain.  









 I bet [Rick Ross](http://www.bornrich.com/top-10-expensive-rapper-jewelry.html/10) could figure out how to get it. 




 Gah. why do these creepy underwater photos keep popping up everywhere.
