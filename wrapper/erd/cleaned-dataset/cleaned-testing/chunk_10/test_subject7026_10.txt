 Just shrug it off bro 




 Never heard that one before 




 If you're being healed and you're on about 30 hp without crit heals, take the health.  
  
If you're a Medic you can heal the people who needed the Health Kit. Just heal everyone and let people take Health Kits whenever they want.

 HUD is Toonhud if anyone is wondering because that's the most common question when people post images like these. 




 I'm sure that this is just something in my settings but I can't see both of my effects at the same time, [here's how I see it] (http://imgur.com/a/Rs4xZ). it's like that post a few days ago about the Sight for Sore Eyes and Fillamental doing the same sort of thing with the stacking, but I know that having both storm effects does exist because I've seen it earlier today somewhere on Youtube.  
  
If anyone could shed some light on what settings I need to screw with to fix this I would be extremely grateful. 




 A while ago friend of mine got scammed out of his unusual and I managed to get the scammer marked on pretty much every trade site, my friend got some compensation from a couple guys who heard about it. He showed me the items he got back and it added up to around $85, considering that he got scammed out of a $50 unusual he was pretty happy.  
  
Those items now reside in my backpack because I bought his backpack but they live on through me I guess. 




 "how do i stop fire fighter from shoot me off edge??" 




 I buy from players because it's not that hard. 




 American Pasta? Freedom Fettuccine?  




 [This it?] (http://www.xnxx.com/video1316837/show_us_that_ass_for_some_cash_-_outdoor_reality_hardcore) 




 My name and item combos are alright, whenever I play Pyro I name myself Death Grips and use [this] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440_2_3939764696) and [this] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440_2_3939774755).

 Scouts are very annoying, but you need to remember that they tend to earn the kills they get by shooting you and then talking whatever shit they want, they did outskill you to get the kill, maybe they got lucky but when you compare that to a Spy with 300 ping running around going "trickstabed noob" after a facestab a Scout seems like a blessing. 




 I went to the New Zealand Comic Con today and saw someone with a Gibus on, I wish I took some pictures but my phone is bad so I didn't. But yeah it was a Sniper holding a Huntsman with a Gibus on, not sure if he had Pyrovision or not. 




 "Jack what is this?"  
  
-Me, back when I started playing. 




 Where's the *"I only really like Borneo can I vote to just keep that one?"* option? 




 I mean I guess, but the Huntsman goes faster than Sonic the Hedgehog in the green hill zone with a hitbox bigger than... Something big. The hitbox for the Huntsman is big enough to score headshots without aiming much and does 360 damage from a second of drawing the arrow compared to 150 from a Quickscoped Headshot.  
  
Sauce: I main Sniper and Soldier with over 500 hours as each. 




 Thanks. 




 Because it goes "BWANG TANG BWANG BWANG BWANG BWANG BONG TWANG BWANG" And I dislike that. 




 They were all like "BWEEEEEEW QUICK QUICK GOTTA GO FAST BWAH BWAH BWAH WMWEMMWMWWWEEEEEEE"  
  
So yeah what season was that? 









 I'd say blame the music industry, sometimes people listen to Death Grips while playing Medic. 




 How can you claim to not use OP weapons and use the Huntsman over the Stock Sniper?  




 But that means the Medic needs to go to those paths and ditch the rest of his team.

[This is extremely ugly.] (http://i.imgur.com/0qCiksR.png) 




 I have 8,000ish on my Minigun, almost Hale's Own.  
Rocket Launcher on like 3,000 and Direct Hit on like 4,000.  
  
[If you want to see the exact numbers you can look on the first page here.] (http://backpack.tf/profiles/76561198049118645) 




 I gave someone the achievement once and was like "Only 50?" because he was [this] (http://i.imgur.com/BqvsX4E.png) kind of guy, I don't remember the actual hats he had but there was a burning Shako and either one of the all class miscs or a Soldier's Stash.  
  
Either way he looked rich, so he probably just trades alot but still I got the 50th backstab on a rich guy. 




 The shoes? 




 I know, that's why it looks bad, but just saying it's bad and therefore ugly is like saying "I enjoyed this movie" is the same as "10/10". There's no reasoning behind why you enjoyed and rated the movie so highly.  
  
I could have just said 'It looks bad and is ugly" but that's not explaining *why* it looks bad.  
  
Ugliness isn't just looking bad, it's *living* bad.   
[My friend Spongebob said it best.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N0yXGVWS1Y)  
  
If something wants to be bad it needs to be open for criticism, just look at that movie Quarantine, it's an awful version of something good, just like the Bazooka vs The Stocket Launcher, I'm not going to go any deeper into this but basically America took the movie [REC] and made it ugly, an American took the Stock RL and made it ugly.  
  
The [duct tape] (http://i.imgur.com/boQuHqI.png) is still awful so I'm glad it gets held behind me. 




 I've done the same many times, (I just want an unusual not gonna lie.) at one point I straight up said "I've reported like 12 bugs yo just give me a hat already lmao" when I was reporting a way to remove the trade restriction using the market. 




 That looks like a DBD Attendant, did you see a Pyro with a DBD Little Buddy on that round of Snowplow? I swear I remember seeing someone with your hat combo and tried to do a high five for being Disco Bros.  
  
rest in peace me getting backstabbed before ^^possibly you could slap my hand 




 I think this also fixed a glitch I was having with the Hitman's Heatmaker, I had to turn off auto reload or the bar would go off instantly on a kill. 




 mini sentry a shit 




 It's fully understandable and after reading it myself I can see how it could have been interpreted. 




 Woah that is actually pretty cool. But yeah if you plan on getting a hat that you will wear most of the time, always see if there's a strange version.  
  
Personally I don't do this because I'm that guy who has unusuals all over the place. And I guess I did get a Unique Lone Survivor instead of strange just yesterday but that's besides the point.  




 The Beggar's Bazooka not only looks like shit but takes a shit on players. This horrendous pile of trash has dropped too many ubers while looking worse than ramen noodles thrown onto bread with butter. (But for real noodles in bread is SO good but looks awful.)  
  
[Look at this thing.] (http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/777183914644516158/36652D6B073BF227551DFA753D64AE7262DDF5EB/) What is the appeal for the design? "Yo guys have you ever wanted to take the normal rocket launcher, and throw garbage all over it!? Well for only $2.49 USD this can be all yours!"   
  
Let me break down this item for you.  
Starting at the back we have [this] (http://i.imgur.com/LJQLuer.png), it's the missing piece of the [Stainless Pot!] (http://tf2wiki.net/ww/images/thumb/b/ba/Soldiertinpan.png/200px-Soldiertinpan.png)   
And then that Pot Lid is DUCT TAPED ONTO THE ROCKET LAUNCHER.  
  
Now we can move past the only thing keeping it on, without the duct tape I'm sure it would fall apart. Wait no don't worry guys, [there's a belt.] (http://i.imgur.com/nwCW9BS.png) Just in case your pants fell off mid fight.  
  
I can only assume that [this is for aiming] (http://i.imgur.com/TWEV0cY.png) good luck putting this into use when it spreads like butter on ramen noodle bread (Really guys, try it, it's great.)  
  
[What's this for?] (http://i.imgur.com/otT3vlf.png)  
  
[This handle] (http://i.imgur.com/Q4MVHx3.png) is held on by [cable ties] (http://www.samuelgrant.co.uk/productsbig/135.jpg)  
  
You didn't think that the Stainless Pot was the only hat here did you? This isn't just any [handle] (http://i.imgur.com/ac39anE.png), this is the [Handyman's Handle!] (http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/thumb/a/a4/Handyman's_Handle.png/250px-Handyman's_Handle.png?t=20111210080558)  
  
[Why is this here? Incase the rockets get jammed?] (http://i.imgur.com/W0wooyy.png)  
  
[No idea what this is but it's dumb] (http://i.imgur.com/vNJy0p7.png)  
  
So in summation, it looks bad. 




 How about you don't let him kill you? The same can be said in the ranks of Gibus players, some hatless noob dominated the Gibus and stole his hat! That's just rude. 




 You either die a hero, or live long enough to get so many points that you are the one to get autobalanced to become the villain. 




 You have me misunderstood friend, I mean "I got kicked for doing what is in the video yesterday", the other Pyros were doing the exploit, I was the one trying to prevent the exploit. 




 Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't there a strange Sole Mate worth about 1 key? If you're planning on snatching up a Sole Mate you might as well go big or go home. 




 So TF2 added a Pay to Win contract to counter spies and one contract is about keeping your sentry alive to get 5 kills?   
  
#SpyVsEngineerUpdateWillProbablyBeHereInAbout2YearsHYPE 




 I got kicked for doing this yesterday.  
"kick loak he is trying to do exploit" - The first asshole Pyro.  
"yeh kick he try to blow up last jihad jihad we tfgo now other stupid shit" - Asshole #2  
  
Edit: When I said doing this I meant doing what is in the video and stopping the exploit.

 Dude your Pyro is adorable, is that Marvin the Martian? 




 Personally I see literally no reason to not use this in MGE outside of BM. In pubs it rocks too if you spam like I do. 




 it would be extremely joyful 









 for you  
  
^^^^^^^^pan 




 it would be extremely panful 




 Can someone give me some info on why Nebris is called a cheater? 




 no one cared who i was until i put on the pan 




 at least you pan talk, who are you? 




 was getting caught part of your pan? 




 I'm counting that as the Widowmaker because it looks just like it. 




 [bruh] (http://i.imgur.com/HzXLTIG.png) 




 Well normal items are pretty expensive these days :^) 




 Maybe you can be that Medic? Pubs need a German every now and again. Also it helps boost gamesense as a little bonus. 




 Maybe in 2010 it was 25 on hit, but before this nerf/buff, it was 15.  
  
And as for healing 45 per shot, just grab a Medic buddy and the Blackbox was always a downgrade, it was never that strong to begin with if you could put a few seconds into thinking about killing him. 




 Title. Every item that can be crafted (To my knowledge at least) gets a craft number, only 100 of them can be seen ingame, but like [these canteens] (http://i.imgur.com/atD8a3y.png) they have a number visible on backpack.tf, so that got me thinking, what item has the highest crafted number?  
  
I'm sure that metal would be the highest if it had a number, but come on now, let's not be bitches about this, let's talk about cooler items.  
  
Personally I think that the item most people need to craft at a point is the MvM Upgrade Canteen.  
  
What are your thoughts? 




 You're a Soldier though, you'd need to be really bad to not do damage to get about +15 back anyway. I guess it was only a nerf to players who can't do damage. (No offence if you aren't good with this weapon after the nerf/buff) 




 I spent $7 on a spec ks strange BFB *ONE FUCKING DAY BEFORE THE UPDATE* 




 This reminds me of what I wanted to happen in MvM, I tried to use a teleport to spawn canteen to take someone back to spawn, didn't work.  




 That's a lie, this is OC right here. 









 This one time I ended up doing something that made me feel dumber than dirt.  
  
I was playing some Team Fortress 2 in a public game and somebody was sitting in the spawn not moving.  
I think nothing of it and go out to fight the good fight.  
After about 10 minutes of playing I hear a voice say "Mmph, shorwy I waws ghetting foowd."  
Clearly the guy had food in his mouth and didn't know to chew with his mouth closed.  
From what I can tell he was probably autistic or something because he talked in all the Heavy's lines.  
I play Medic alot so I ended up healing him.  
He always called me "DOCTOR" because that's what I was for him, I was his Doctor.  
In TF2 there's a mechanic called "Ubercharge" which you can google to learn about, not gonna explain it for you.  
The kid yells "DOCTOR, CHARGE ME WHEN BABY TEAM IS NEARBY! HIT IT DOCTOR, CHARGE ME!"  
I pop the uber and he wipes out the whole enemy team.  
He adds me and I accept.  
Every time we play together I go Medic and he goes Heavy.  
He always yells Heavy's battle cry or laughs like him all the time.  
Always thanks me, "YOU ARE GREAT DOCTOR!"  
I think he was poor because he never played any games other than TF2.  
Whenever I asked him about it he said "Doctor, money is needed, must collect money, but money is hard now."  
He sounded so sad so I asked him if he ever saw [Meet the Medic] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36lSzUMBJnc) to brighten up the mood.  
When he said no I gave him a link to the video.  
He was very ecstatic and eagerly asking about the part where the Medic put the uber part into the heart.  
He asked if it was possible to get a new heart with uber.  
I said heart transplants are possible, but without uber.  
He got sad again.  
"Maybe in the future."  
He then gave a Heavy laugh and said "THEN DOCTOR, HEAVY WILL WAIT FOR FUTURE."  
  
A few weeks pass.  
  
He messaged me saying "DOCTOR, Heavy will not be fighting until later in the night."  
It wasn't until tomorrow until he got on.  
For the record he called himself Heavy because that's the only class he ever played and it was his Steam name.  
  
I got a message saying "DOCTOR, Heavy doesn't feel well. I go to other doctors but they were nowhere near as good as you, DOCTOR."  
He sent this message when I was already asleep, I have no fucking idea where he lives.  
Last message said "DOCTOR, Heavy will go now. But do not fear baby men on other team. You are good doctor. With you, victory is always good. Heavy will join in future.  
By the time I got the message he was already offline.  
He never came back on in a year.  
One day he came back on, I messaged him and asked why he'd been away the whole time.  
It was his mom.  
"David, (Heavy), died of heart failure, I'm sorry. Are you the doctor he was always talking about? You're the only friend on his friends list. He was always going on about how him and the Doctor were best friends and how you always lead the team to victory. I don't know what he was talking about, but I was happy that he was happy. We're selling this computer because we never had much money to begin with, if we did he would be here right now."  
I sat there and looked at the screen for a good 5 minutes before another message popped up.  
"Before I sell this computer, I have one question I need to ask."  
I replied with "Please go ahead."  
"I need something."  
"What is it?"  
"I need about tree fiddy."  
  
Now it was around this time that I realized Heavy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! "I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy you god damn loch ness monstah!"  




 The saddest thing I've ever seen was when my son stole my money and basically changed my whole perspective of him. Reader beware, you're in for a tear.  
  
It wasn't too long ago. I was doing some work around the house, and he came and asked "Dad, can I ask you a question?" so I said, "As long as you didn't get someone pregnant, go ahead."
He asked me if he could borrow $50 and I said "If you're just gonna spend it on booze you can go work for it."  
He just stared at me, looking real sad, then he went back inside. I started to contemplate if he actually needed something or if I was right about it just being beer money. I decided to trust him with the money and hope he wouldn't come back home reeking of liquor.  
About 4 hours later he came back looking incredibly proud of himself, he told me that he spent the money on a new suit to be made for him so he could get a job.
I was extremely happy about his decision to get a job, I had to sincerely apologize about accusing him of wanting cash for booze.  
I then asked him: Son, was there any change? He replied "Yes, About three fiddy." which he refused to give back. It was about that time I realized my son was a 7 stories tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damn loch ness Monster had gotten me again. Damnit, monsta, you ain't getting no three fiddy.

 The world's strongest man, Mark Henry got killed by a Scout! 




 Here's how I did my open contract:  
Get a Soldier/Demo/Scout or anyone else that can damage themselves to \#cutforbeiber and throw them Sandviches.  
  
Every Sandvich is 1 point which is very easy to grind when you stand by a medicine cabinet. 




 I need to fucking see a video of this 




 You can remove just the kit. 




 I had just started to (ab)use that thing! 




 With the nerf to the Baby Face's now you need to pull out the PPBP to not be heavily gimped from either jumping or taking damage. That's the only time when Quickman Bostonian's fall damage is justified, when he doesn't want to jump and lose 3/4 of his speed. 




 But when you have the weapon out you take 20% extra damage from everything, so if it makes you take 20% extra afterburn it's still 3 but if they use "The Price is Right!" Logic and mess around with the numbers like I mess around with sound files then you probably take more fire damage than you could heal. 




 I agree! (What the fuck is he talking about?) 




 Dude you got the American Pasta launcher! The Freedom Fettuccine!  




 I actually thought Sasha sounded familiar when I was watching AoT on Netflix earlier today, so I googled the voice actress and was like "WOAOOAOAOAAH DUDE WHAT ARE YOU KIDDING ME THE POTATO GIRL IS THE SAME GIRL THAT SCOUT MAINS WANNA BANG!?"  
  
Well actually my reaction was "..." because I don't talk to myself but in my head I was flipping out. 




 I think I used to use that HUD, I'm trying to remember the name of it. Is it one of the following?  
  
Toonhud.  
Flathud.  
Rayshud.  
Yahud. 




 All painted Australium Gold, I think the hat is the Cosa Nostra Cap, The Blood Banker and the Made Man. I put those three into loadout.tf and got [this] (http://i.imgur.com/Sfn6Osz.png) so I think I'm correct.  
  
I don't like that I'm better at naming hats than I am at algebra, but I guess the only jobs that require algebra are algebra teachers so I think I'm fine with my hat knowledge. 




 To me this is just another thing to stick my dick in. 




 If you have Netflix or something you should check out some of the shows she has a voice in and be like "Yo that's Miss Pauling eating a potato! I'm so glad that /u/test_subject7026 showed me that this character is actually Miss Pauling! Now I'm gonna go play Saints Row and use the Ash DLC and basically have Miss Pauling as a homie because that's a cool DLC!" 









 [kncucklxers hte ecnhchildalada] (https://sonicisreal.bandcamp.com/track/unknown-from-m-e) 




 I respect your opinion and do agree that it is a great weapon, but compared to what it used to be I just can't use it in the same way. 




 There's really no other option now, it used to be a choice between jumping higher or taking no fall damage, now it's just jumping higher because the PBPP is a horrible weapon. 




 The last one would be about as useful as a Stickybomb Launcher that sticks to players.  
  
If you could pick up your own intel, why not just run it to the other team and help them cap?  




 It's a good thing I already got some karma today because I know I'm going to lose some here from butthurt Sniper mains.

AFAIK she got fired from Reddit and people are mad about it. 




 *sweet guitar riff* 




 Alright thanks, I was pretty sure the guy was trying to scam me because his in game inventory was worth maybe 30 cents at the most and kept saying he was going to catch a plane in "10 minutes" and kept pressuring me to give him the items. 




 So somebody wanted to buy some items in a game from me through PayPal, he said he's going first and I'm pretty sure he did judging from [this email] (http://i.imgur.com/pay2u34.png).  
  
But it looks like it's telling me to add the email to an account, which I've already done. I've had this email sitting here for at least 3 hours now and I [still haven't got any money in my account] (http://i.imgur.com/mxOKdmO.png).  
  
Is it normal to have the email like this while my account has the email confirmed?  
  
Edit: Changed the screenshot of the email to not include the guy's name. 




 Have you ever seen a Clown's Laughter?  
*badum tss* 




 rest in peace lew moo, he was an hero to us all ;( 




 I want your most expensive item! But not really because it's private and don't know what it is. 




 Text post so no karma whoring for me :O 




 One of them sold for over $500 nzd! The most nzd an item can cost is around $550 so I'd say in a few weeks you can get the max Steam cash on your pro ks kit. 




 Can confirm, my Sandwich is much like a real sandwich and does not come back after eating it.
