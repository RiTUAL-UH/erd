 I just think of the proverb:

 If buried in peace then the dead can speak their story, but if buried in unrest then the dead are mute and fight to be heard

I see it as my fianc trying to contact me however he can, which was to taint the fruit of the tree he was buried under. He wanted to send me a message, just like the others who have been buried in those grounds. 




 I need to tell someone this story. I can't go to the police. I fear for my life and need help.

It started a few months ago. I recently moved across Mexico to Palenque with my friend Javier. We managed to wrangle ourselves jobs for a few months at a spa hotel - a real high-class place, popular with American tourists. I'm from the states, myself, kinda - my parents moved to Seattle from Northern Ireland when I was 5. We went to Mexico most years on vacation. My parents loved being treated like royalty, but personally I loved the culture. I remember being 11 when I first scaled the pyramids at Teotihuacan, and during my adolescence I had a fascination with the Day of the Dead celebrations. In the UK and US, we don't tend to have any real celebration for the dead - it's more like a sadness and reflection on the anniversary of a person's death, rather than a celebration that they had lived.

My fascination for Mexico stuck with me, and while growing up I learned as much as I could about the Aztecs and Mayans, and indeed other ancient cultures of central and southern America. So, when choosing what to study in adulthood, it was only natural for me to pick ancient history, and eventually I specialized in Mesoamerican history. I was lucky enough to get a year of study based in Mexico City, and well, life was pretty sweet for me. I was doing what I loved in a country I adored.

So a few months ago my studies ended for the year. My parents were expecting me to return back to Seattle and pick up some bar work or something. Instead, I wanted to explore a corner of Mexico I had not been to yet. I had become good friends with Javier while in Mexico City, and together we were a good package for the hotel - both fluent in English and Spanish, not looking for long-term work, and just looking for some decent tip money to waste on mezcal.

I wouldn't say Javier and I had a drinking problem, but we certainly enjoyed a drink every night, and indeed on the weekends the drinking would get quite heavy and the parties more and more crazy. Once we awoke after a veterinary friend's party with shooting pains in our backs. It turns out we had been electronically tagged with some GPS tracking devices that they use on dogs. "We can't help you if you lose your mind, but at least you'll never lose your body" our friend quipped.

When we arrived in Palenque, it felt like the sort of place we could find a corner of and feel right at home. There is a decent amount of tourism in the area, including animal sanctuaries, Mayan ruins and - if you're in to that sort of stuff - the waterfall from Predator. As a fan of all three, I felt right at home. Javier is right at home with anything to drink, so we were perfectly content.

On one of our afternoons off, we were sat having some lunch in the town center. I remember there being a newspaper stand just opposite, with the front page emblazoned with news of 'another disappearance' in the local area. Newspapers in Mexico do not hold back any detail, with any gang violence completely uncensored on the front pages, so a 'disappearance' did not seem that extraordinary. We ate our food, until a crunch interrupted us.

"What the fuck?"

Javier spat out some food back in to his bowl. He was eating an assortment of fruit.

"Snuck a nut in, did they?" I asked.

"No... it didn't feel like... what the fuck?"

He picked at his bowl, scooped something on to the end of his spoon and held it up.

"It's a fingernail" he said.

"A fingernail? How the hell did that get in there? Call the waiter."

We called the waiter over and showed him the nail. He froze up, stepping out of reality for a moment before recovering and saying "sorry, sorry" and taking the bowl to the counter. He did not show the owner, busy preparing food, instead opting to just throw the contents of the bowl away and bringing us a fresh lot. Javier's appetite was not affected, and we went about our day.

A few days later, we went out to view the nearby ruins. I had to drag Javier there, of course, but I was not going to miss an opportunity to go. We caught some lunch along the road on the way back, and near to us was a stall selling refreshments. These sorts of stalls are everywhere in Mexico, but again what caught my eyes was a newspaper headline - a 'fresh disappearance'. When our waitress came over, I asked her what the story was. She was a little hesitant to answer, but said in Spanish, "I don't know, but in Palenque they say that if someone is buried in peace then they will be able to tell their story".

Her proverb interested me, and upon researching it I learned she only told me half. The whole proverb goes: 'If buried in peace then the dead can speak their story, but if buried in unrest then the dead are mute and fight to be heard'. My research showed that The Day of the Dead established a connection between the living and the peaceful dead, allowing the peaceful dead to rest knowing they are remembered. However, those buried in unrest do not get a connection, and go mad from beyond the grave, resorting to demonic and unholy methods in order to be heard, seen or simply noticed.

The waitress simply hoped that the missing people, if dead, were buried peacefully, so that their loved ones could connect with them on the next Day of the Dead. If there was any malpractice then there would be no saying what horror could occur, and through sheer coincidence, a moment later while eating I felt something like nothing else in my mouth, and as I clamped down on it it almost disintegrated. Fighting back the urge to vomit, I spat out everything on to my plate. As I gazed at my plate, it appeared to gaze up at me. An eye, discolored, but unmistakably an eye. Unmistakably a human eye. I feinted.

I awoke to Javier urging, "we need to get out of here". It felt like a good idea, and so we headed back to the hotel. We spoke at length. Javier wanted to go to the newspapers. He spoke of the mystery and how we could get enough money to see us through more trips like this. "Imagine if we didn't have to work while we explored the world" he would say. I just felt like returning back to the US, but we compromised and decided to just ignore what had happened, and return back to normality.

Normality would never resume, though. They came that night. I was awoken by the door being knocked in with an almighty crash. There were no voices. I looked at Javier, catching the fear in his eye. Then a kick through our bedroom door. Masked faces rushed in. I was knocked out cold.

I awoke in the back of an open-back truck along a bumpy road. I could not see much except for light and dark through the bag on my head. I could make out the moon and the stars, and figured where the cabin of the truck was. I laid still and listened, and quickly established I was alone in the back. Two men were in the cabin, their muffled voices talking of burying us and earning a paycheck.

I had one thing in mind - survival. I maneuvered down to the end of the truck, and hurled myself as best I could out the end. I didn't care that I'd be hurt, and it did hurt like hell. But better that than be killed. I managed to get to the side of the road, used a tree to scrape the bag off my head, and spent some time wrestling my hands free of a fairly makeshift bind.

I took a large breath of air, and snapped back in to a panic. Javier. He must still be in the truck. I continued up the road. I had no idea how long I would need to travel, but I told myself I would find him no matter what it takes. I could wrestle someone, take a gun if they had one. I continued for what must have been two hours, until I reached the end of the road, and some grand gates. La Huerta Blanca. The White Orchard. I noticed a security camera and a guarded post. I don't know what I expected.

Tired, and in less of a reactive mood, I thought it best to go to the police. I returned to our hotel, and must admit I cried a great deal. I looked around the room and saw that nothing had been taken. Only us. This was not a burglary, but an assassination, but why weren't we killed? I picked up my phone and-

My phone! Of course my phone! I remembered how Javier had a tag. Probably the only time of my life where some drunken lunacy would prove to be useful. Going to the police would take too long, and clearly the disappearances are not being solved. Time was of the essence, and I packed up all of my things, and went back to the orchard.

Scaling the outside wall was easy. I guess the guard was just a formality, or to stop any trucks entering. They would likely not care for the occasional scrumping. I loaded up the tracking app on my phone, and noticed the expanse of the Orchard. It was huge. It seemed like I walked through almost every type of plant and tree. I was getting close to Javier's signal as I walked among the orange trees.

300 yards. 200 yards. 100 yards. He should be here, somewhere. I looked around, and could see nothing. My feet were muddied on the soft ground, and my legs tired from the walking, but I found energy, manically whispering his name, calling for any noise or tremor. No response. He wasn't there. I could not explain the signal. I sat under one of the trees, and cried, and cried, and cried.

I went in to hiding for some time after that. I imagined they would be looking for me, sat at the bus station. The bus station is a second-class one, with no security barriers. It would be easy to pull me in to a van and 'disappear' me, too. I walked out of town, told a village local I was a scientist studying the local flora, and ate at the same cafe every day.

Now, this morning I sat down for breakfast. The cafe owner gave me my usual - a pastry with an orange on the side. Basic, but will see you through to lunch. I ate my pastry, and took my orange out to the nearby forest. I sat on a log and peeled the orange. I split the orange down the middle and something thudded to the ground. I look down and see a finger. But there was something about it that I immediately noticed. I knew that finger. I bought that ring. I flashed back to the moment he accepted it. I burst in to a fit, fell to my knees, and wept. 




 That's what I believe. I cannot know for certain, but I imagine he slipped, and with the rope stashed around his neck and the stick/wood seat of the rope-swing susceptible to being caught on something, I think it was just an unfortunate accident. 




 I assume you are referring to commenting out of character. Let me pose you a couple of questions: Who am I? Who is the narrative about? After experiencing something, learning something, or being told a story, subsequent to recreating it yourself for an audience, one needs to consider what style of narrative to use. *Kiss of the Spider Woman* showed me a narrative style that would be befitting of this story. That is what I meant by its influence - simply how I chose to present the story.

I hope that clears things up a little. 




 My inspiration for the narrative came from Manuel Puig's *Kiss of the Spider Woman*, which is fantastic. If you ever get a chance to read it, do it. 




 Thank you for the kind words.
