 Yeah you're right. That would be nice to see.  




 Who else thinks they should film new, more faithful to-the-books Lord of the Rings movies? 




 Unmarked Toyota Corolla(Camry?)? Come on, police! Give us a chance here.  




 It did. I bought it today! Thanks for showing me that!  




 I'm about to purchase the game and I've been doing some research on what build I should do.

I've taken the archer dps route in all of the MMOs/Elder Scroll games I've played. What class type would best suit this play-style? 




 I personally don't mind that. The only experience I've had with MMOs has been Runescape and LOTRO. Runescape has gone to shit and I don't feel like paying for LOTRO. Is everything available to you after the initial purchase? Or will you be forced to pay money to progress throughout the game? 




 Is it a pay-to-win thing? Nothing bothers me more than a game where players dump money into the game in order to rise through the ranks and surpass those that are actually dedicated to leveling. I want something that is a level playing field. I've heard that you have to pay for some classes as well as mounts. Do they offer any advantages?  




 I've been looking for a good game I can play in my free time. I've sunk countess hours into Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim. I've been leaning towards spending the money for ESO because I am already familiar with the series. I know it isn't exactly like the previous elder scrolls game, but I wanted to get an idea of what it is like from someone who has been playing it for a while. 




 Focus on not dying  




 I quit rs3 to play osrs and I'm done with osrs. Runescape will never be what it was. It really is a shame, but I'm tired of dealing with the toxicity of the community, the meaninglessness of achieving once sought after goals such as a maxed account or a huge cash stack. No. I just can't continue dumping time and effort into this game.  




 I'll check it out. I used to play a ton of Lord of the Rings Online and really enjoyed it. It's probably one of the most satisfied fanbase I've ever been a part of. Any gripes or complaints are quickly fixed and the game is expanding.  




 I've been thinking about it, but I might start playing some other games I set aside for rs. 




 THANK YOU! I just made a post like this and I hope people read it and pay attention to it. The game in its current state is atrocious - almost as bad as the beginnings of rs3. I've been involved in the RuneScape community for a long time, and even had an account on RuneScape Classic. I didn't want to part with my almost maxed rs3 account, but I just couldn't stand for the new rs3; it just wasn't satisfying anymore. 2007Scape is also taking a tumble for the worst. This is leaving me thinking: Is it really time to just move on and forget about the game? 




 No this is ridiculous. You're obviously very new to the game. Most of the community (including myself) has been around for almost 10 years now. We refuse to stand for what's happening to the current state of the game.  




 This might be a shitpost, and I apologize, but:

*IS* there a version of RuneScape that meets the community's needs? When RS3 went sour the community bitched about how awful the game got and how Jagex was "selling out" and the community suffered a major loss for that. After hearing so much negativity from an extremely displeased fanbase, they decided to listen and gave the community what it was looking for. Welcome, 2007Scape. Finally! *That* version of RuneScape I longed for while mindlessly clicking around in the decrepit shell of the game I once knew and loved. "This is it!" the newly satisfied RuneScapers exclaimed as they strapped in for a blast into the past. 

I am a recent convert from RS3 to 2007Scape; I just couldn't bare abandoning my almost-maxed account in RS3. However, I just couldn't stand the new and aimless skills they added to the game. Dungeoneering isn't even a skill; it's a glorified mini-game (albeit Dungeoneering is a very rewarding "skill"). Then came divination. Initially the skill confused me and didn't see a purpose in it. Upon further research, however, I *still* don't see a purpose in it. Solomon's store is just scattering the game with pointless cosmetic upgrades and pets that clog the GE and banks. It's a frilly and superficial version of a game that strayed away from what it once was. Then I looked upon the 2007 servers for comfort. Initially I found it. It was so familiar. Starting out and getting a character going took me no time; *this* is what I've been looking for all along. This version of the game was something I knew and was confident in. 

Time and a couple new updates passed by and now I feel myself let down and feeling upset about the current state of the game. I am only getting word of the NMZ updates, but have seen splashers  lining the streets; and bots littering every skilling-hotspot/mini-game. Integrity is dead. Players who have dedicated themselves to this game can no longer take pride in their achievements.  Unfortunately the game is controlled by a company who no longer cares for its fanbase and only for their wallets. Maybe the "golden days" of RuneScape are at an end. After all, *everyone* does have those "RuneScape golden days."
