 Its something that's been talked about for years and every major sport has huge alcohol sponsorship and advertising how much longer until you think they ban it? 

Personally I hope they don't unless another sponsor is ready to take its place as they do give the sports a ton of cash and I don't really see who would be willing to put that much money into it.  




 I see this going the way of the nbn when Labor was in power over budget and way behind schedule I just don't believe this will happen in the time frame he claims.

It will happen eventually but if he makes this a election promise it's not one he can keep 




 Would of been easier on either difficulty he was just too easy to dodge and attack I barely lost any health to him 




 way too ambitious not a chance in hell that will happen in 15 years even if they get office next election 




 good it was a stupid law to begin with we should always have the right to silence 









 just shows you that some people in this sub are low pieces of shit 




 for about a week or two before people stop caring it's not like these wars are new they have been going on for years upon years and people have known about it

 




 hasn't Nestl done some shady shit in Africa (human rights abuses and what not)

yet he does ads for them no problems 




 i think it's because there's more female victims so the male issues are brushed off to the side

it's also likely because most people have the mindset that men should toughen up or suck it up etc 




 people still buy porn on dvd? i thought that market was dead since the internet became more mainstream 10+ years ago with the gazillion porn sites

besides you have to hide a dvd you can always delete history or use incognito mode 




 if it wasn't the British it would have been the dutch or Spanish and if by some miracle they lasted until world war 2 the Japanese most likely would have invaded 




 tastes good though 




 it would be a once off payment if anything no way they would continue it after that

but if they did keep making payments they shouldn't get any other financial aid or services as they should be able to provide for themselves 




 wouldn't even get as far as the police the army would be a last resort if they managed to actually get that far 




 exactly why it should never happen 




 I think you mean the flying spaghetti monster  




 100 million isn't  going to solve world hunger and it's not his responsibility 

Countries like Africa need to pull the finger out and start producing more food they are more than capable to feed themselves The government's just need to start caring more about the future than their term in office  




 Que The waste of money comments why aren't we solving world hunger etc etc 




 they should of allowed you to hunt down the last crone on any of the endings not just the bad one all game i wanted to kill all 3 of those bitches
 




 was anyone else annoyed how the game went back to how it was before the last chapter?

i know everyone had different endings but it would of been nice to see the changes or at least get some dialouge from npcs at what not

 




 the ending wasn't that great (got the good ending as well) considering how amazing the rest of the game was plus that final boss fight was pathetically easy 




 i axii'd him on the last encounter i was on my way to a quest and couldn't be bothered fighting him 




 exactly it's like people think this will stop cheating or something

they'll use tinder or just go out to a pub and pick someone up or fuck a co worker  




 bringing down this site isn't going to stop people using other sites and apps like tinder and what not to cheat

it will accomplish nothing 




 they won't take the site down they are not going to give up a site with 40 million (even if most are bots or scammers) accounts because some hackers told them to

they will call the bluff and the hackers won't do anything

got to say i'm getting sick of hackers atm and all the threats and ddos attacks etc etc 




 the fuck does that have to do with anything?

someone always has to bring up anti-gay/gay shit with everything these days 




 people don't think of it that way because it isn't the government and at the moment it's "cool" to like hacking groups that do shit like this

just wait until they do it to something that affects them and they will no longer support it 




 i don't think it will be that bad besides it's necessary after Indonesia cut the amount it imports from Australia many farmers would be up shit creek if another deal wasn't made 




 it's good that a deal is in the works with china it's a nice fuck you to Indonesia and it will help out farmers here that would of been screwed when Indonesia cut the amount of imports  




 that's what i thought so many people go to the emergency room for something as simple as the common cold 














 fuck i'm glad i don't live in america.. 

i broke my neck 3 years ago had to be airlifted to hospital have surgery to patch up a 20cm cut on my head (had to be put under if anything went wrong) and spend a week there (got lucky it wasn't worse) getting regular xrays ct scans and mri scans and psychotherapy and treatment from spinal specalists not to mention the countless painkillers

cost me $0 and i wasn't even insured at the time.. they never sent the bill for the airlift so i got lucky on that one 




 he did 500k in his last 5 weeks in office if i recall correctly 




 he was called kevin 747 for a reason tax payers funded a hell of a lot of his traveling i wouldn't call him one of the "good" politicians  




 hobby or not i wouldn't call it a dream job

probably worse entry level jobs but compared to retail other jobs most likely would offer more progession into management which looks better on a resume for future jobs.. to me that's far better than being able to talk about video games and get paid for it

 
 




 never will happen unless you post something about tony abbot sucking a dick or a anti liberal party post it's rare to get it out of single digits

if you use less politics only 5 posts appear 




 sorry but no they are not liberal/labor are still the two main parties and that's where people vote

the greens simply don't get enough votes to threaten either one of them 




 i'm guessing the honeymoon period with it ends pretty quickly when they realise it's just a job like any other

getting a game cheaper or a week earlier or something probably gets old when you realise much better jobs are around 




 i have to say it but how the hell is working at a video game shop a "dream job"

it's a low paying retail job like every other one except you sell video games 




 i killed the spirit turns out to be the better option anyway

agreed that it was the best quest in the game it's a shame that some of the others were a bit rushed 




 the gst rise is inevitable i'm actually surprised it's hasn't happened already

as long as low income earners are compensated it actually could do some good 














 even if police are justified in killing someone people don't care anymore they'll just say fuck the police etc 




 if you have all the platinum you can control how much is sold similar to how diamonds are sold now (they are not rare just controlled well by companies)

no one would try to sell it all at once 




 it's a good game and i recommend playing it the story is really good but pretty short (20 or so hours) graphics are good for a 2011 game

a few things about the gameplay that you might not like

potions can't be drunk during combat you have to drink them beforehand (this includes potions like swallow)

no climbing or jumping down unless there is a certain spot the game allows it

no fast travel or horses 




 should of been in the game from the beginning considering it was in the previous two games 




 no idea why they couldn't see that before releasing the game.. eredin really should of been a challenge

for me it was a disappointing way to end a amazing game 




 granted i'm playing on normal but i just finished the game and found the eredin boss fight painfully easy.

i get that i have a lot of skills and good armor and what not at that point but some of the monsters and even high level enemies put up a better fight than him

i didn't even need to use a single potion as it was just way too easy to dodge and when he was using magic he was basically a sitting duck

was a bit a of a disappointment after everything you had to do to prepare to fight him for him to go down so easily 




 is anyone even scared of anonymous anymore?

will they ddos a website or something and that will be the avenging of the death? that's all they seem to do when they make threats 




 too many years of the drug war has people believing it's the right way to go about it not to mention countless scare campaigns and the usual BS this nanny state country pulls

people would rather continue fighting a failed drug war and keep criminals rich than try something else like many other countries have

it's why they have no fucking clue what to do about ice atm except those idiotic scare ads which have no effect whatsoever 
 




 they might get a few seats but i honestly never see them getting enough of the vote to be in power
