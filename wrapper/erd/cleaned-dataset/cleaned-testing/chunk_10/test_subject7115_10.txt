 My grandma died this past December at 92. She wasn't the person I knew for the past 6-7 years. She was different. It sucks but I made sure was happy until the end and that's all that mattered to me. 




 If you saw them and thought they acted suspicious that means they're doing a shitty job of being discreet in order to catch the robbers. It's good you called. 




 Oh damn! 




 I'm gonna have to come up to Lubbock for this!!! 




 Bitch I can't breathe!!!!!!! 




 I saw that and thought it was absolutely baffling. There was another part where one of the journalists laid down to take a picture of a statue or Kim Il Song, and a party member chaperone blew up, threatening to have them kicked out of the county that day for disrespecting the statue. Fucking crazy. 




 One day... 




 Good lord you're like a dream 




 :(((( 




 Kind of looks like Shiloh from ChaosMen 




 Hieeeee Ru! I just wanted to say that you are such a huge inspiration and I've been a die hard fan of Drag Race since season 2 when I stumbled upon it. I love all of your ideology and you've helped me learn to really love myself. I really feel it and I know I can do anything I set my mind to. I sometimes get down because I haven't found that one person I can really connect with and to give some of this love to. I'm young and I got time but I can't help feel like something is missing although I have all the pieces in front of me. How do I go about becoming more positive on my outlook towards a prospective partner or finding someone to share myself with? Don't get me wrong, I love my friends and family. What I crave is intimate connection. How do I get what I've desired for so long? Thanks for listening! Can't wait for the new season! 




 Omg that's on my fucking birthday! YASS GAWD!!! 




 My parents have a Dauschund that whines and cries during car rides. Our other Dauschund loves car rides and she does too. It's just when we do long car rides over 45 minutes long that she gets anxiety. She's about 6 years old. I've been thinking maybe getting her an anxiety shirt (a thunder shirt I think is what it's called) and see if that would help her. Holding her in your lap sometimes isn't enough and she'll start whining again. I hope the comstant press use and sensation of being held will help her. 




 I've had great conversations with some nice guys on grindr. Then they ask for a face pic. I either send one because I think "Maybe this guys different. Maybe he won't block me just because of the way I look and we can continue having this awesome talk!" Or I don't send one because I'm too afraid and just want someone to talk to like you do. It never works out after I send a pic. I feel for you bro :( 




 Wow looking good 




 I couldn't sexualize him during GotG. He and my brother look too much alike. But I got to pretend my brother made a fucking awesome movie so I find it a fair trade. 




 And then you look at everyone else like "yeah I did all that shit. I'm a crazy motherfucker" 




 I already had the lucky egg on me and exp share. Beefed up Cobalion and Terrakion and pretty mush destroyed. I know it was a lazy attic but it worked. Thanks for the advice! 




 Thanks! I beat them all! I beefed up Cobalion and Terrakion and took out Iris all with Cobalion, one hit each. Felt good. 




 You go girl! :) starting my journey myself. Keep at it! 




 Hey everyone. I'm fairly new to playing the video games. I only ever watched the tv show and did the card game when I was younger. So I need advice on how to beat the elite four and the champ in this particular game. Here's the pokemon I currently have on me:

Cobalion lvl 67
Terrakion lvl 54
Magneton lvl 53
Unfezant lvl 51
Golduck lvl 48
Surperior lvl 44

Any advice helps. If I need to go and level up my pokemon more, then I'll do it. If you can give me a strategy so I don't have to do that, even better. Anything helps! Thanks! 




 Hello to you all! I just found this subreddit and thought I would get some help. I'm 20 and have always had problems with the amount of oil that is produced on my nose. The pores get clogged very quickly as well. I wash my face every day using just a basic Dove men's face and body wash. My face feels good for about 4 hours, and then it feels like I heavily dowsed my face in oil. I need some help! Anything helps! 




 You means it's not already? 




 my fried chicken is all over the floor 




 I hate how true this is 




 Solomon is bottom 




 yumm 




 I can sense this sort of split is going to happen for my father and I sometime in the future because that fact I'm gay and don't agree with his political ideology. It's silly that something like what happened to you can rip families apart. I'm sorry it happened and I hope something better comes out of it. Keep positive! 




 "Your planes gonna crash! -click-"  I DIED!!! 




 I was too afraid to put Shannel myself but I'm glad someone else put it. Never really liked her (especially in all stars). 




 S1: Tammie//Akashia

S2: Raven//NPB

S3: Manila//Alexis or Mimi, I can't decide

S4: I only liked 4 queens overall from this season and they were Sharon, Chad, Latrice, and Willam.

AS1: Jujubee//Mimi

S5: Alaska or Alyssa//Roxxy or Serena

S6: Bianca//Darienne or Swordfish 




 Oh cool! They're all really beautiful! Hope that I can get one someday. 




 What's the ratio of her Savannahs? 




 It is a SeanCody guy and the name is Allen. This is from a scene with another guy.  [Here you go](http://www.myvidster.com/video/24259275/Allen_Jeffrey) 




 Wish I could compete this year! Won't have the time because I'll be walking children in nature (literally). 




 That picture of Alaska totally reminds of Ru in her l.a.Eyeworks ad. http://imgur.com/9LsNUc4 




 From a small town in Texas. This is accurate. Most I've had to wait is 20 minutes. Wasn't a big deal.

 It was the cardboard thing that came with underwear that was my material in the beginning. I would pick underwear based off the guy who was on the front.

 :( 




 Definitely not a great feel to feel. "'Tis better to love and lost than never to have loved at all." 




 What if they never had sex? It's been a year and a half since things were broken off between me and this guy I was seeing. We didn't have an actual relationship, just sort of a friends who really liked each other. I still feel a lot for him. We never had sex in the 8 months we were together. I felt that I genuinely loved him. He just didn't feel the same.

Edit: words 




 I used to think that the slang and language used within the community was only recently created. Then I watched Paris Is Burning and was educated. I love the film!

 welcome:) 




 cute ;) 




 I went to school in Brenham, TX for a year where the original factory/creamery is and one of my friends worked for them. So much free ice cream! He would come from work every day with a small cooler filled with sandwiches and cookie cones (my favorite!), pints, and half gallons. 




 That's true! 




 Even if you could get decent prints off the blades, they would still have to be run off databases. It could've been done by someone who's never had their prints taken, like dumb teenagers. The Intergrated Automated Fringerprint Identification System [(IAFIS)](http://m.fbi.gov/#http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/fingerprints_biometrics/iafis/iafis)  has millions of fingerprints in its database which includes criminals, civilians, and suspected/known terrorists. Even if the comparison was narrowed down to the local level, they have a large possibility of not getting caught. But do I hope these sick fucks get what's coming to them? Absolutely. 




 Oh fuck. This is hot! 




 I think the peanut butter is PERFECT. So making these! 




 I had one serious conversation with a guy on OKC, and it was such a nice one too. I think it was the next day or so, I took a risk and asked him to dinner (which was super uncomfortable for me since I had never actually asked someone out due to the lack of opportunity). It never happened. Not because he said no, but because after I asked him out he stopped talking to me. We were having a great time talking to each other, but I guess he couldn't handle talking to someone face to face. 




 Anyone have a source? 




 I haven't had a birthday party since 5th grade. Only one person showed up out of the 10 or so I invited, and even then they only could stay for 30 minutes. I haven't had my own party since. So now that I'm older, if I know of someone with a birthday the same day as mine, I suggest we plan together because I know their friends will show up and I might actually have a decent birthday. I've done it twice now and I had so much fun. I could've cared less about presents, I was just happy people were wishing me a happy birthday. 




 Hell yes it is. I also like being the one who gives it! 




 I remember this place as well. I used to talk to a lot of people and it made me feel better. I had a guy that I really liked and he liked me as well and so it was an internet relationship of sorts. Then his mom found out about him and one day I get a call from his phone number, but it was his mom and she accused me of poisoning her son and never to contact him again or she'll call the police. I was 15 at the time and just the threat of police scared me so much. I felt bad for him and also myself because it was the first guy I actually had a connection with. I often wonder how he's doing and if he ever ended up ok. There were other significant people I met but that one has always stayed with me. 




 I completely agree with you. 




 We learned the basics of filling out tax forms in our government and economics classes here in my part of Texas. Everyone had to do it.

 Odd how much satisfaction I got watching the kid cry when the mom took her kitten back in the box. 




 Can't breathe. So hot! 




 Source anyone? 




 My cars name was passed from the person who had it before the person I got it from. It's a white '96 jeep cherokee and his name is Moby, as in Moby Dick the big white whale. 




 Hey there. 20yo chub 350lbs looking for a nice guy 18-30 to chat with. I have kik and skype. Ask me for a photo if you want one. 




 Yum!

 I was just looking at this same pair the other day! They look great on you by the way ;) 




 God you look like this friend of mine from my first year of college I totally crushed on, but you have a beard. Hot hot hot 




 That would be so fun to watch! Hope that happens. Thank you for answering my questions and I love watching you on Getting On. Have a happy new year! 




 Hey Alex! I'm a big fan of yours and I'm so glad to see you doing this AMA. I used to watch MadTV ALL THE TIME when you were on it, no matter what character it was. I just wanted to know if there was anything that you miss about the show and do you still keep in touch with your former cast mates? Do you still do live sketch comedy at all? Thank you for making me and my family laugh all these years! 




 Bear with me, I swear it's all relevant.

I'm a 20 year old gay man who is currently living at home, with a very non existent social life. I've never been in a serious committed relationship where I called him my boyfriend. It's always been strictly physical and I just always went along with it, anything to hopefully have a relationship. I know how that sounds and it took me a whole to realize how ridiculous it is. A guy I was seeing last year (let's call him Bill) ended things after 8 months. During the entire time I thought I was going to get committment from him but it ended on heartbreak. I blame myself for anything I did to make him not want me.

Fast forward and we're good friends. I forgave him, and after a nice break from him I got over my feelings for him. He started seeing this girl and I was fine with everything. He said he wasn't into going full on with a guy. This past Sunday he says things didn't work with this girl. It was too bad because he liked this girl. Later on he shows me a letter and says it's to his "boyfriend." My heart actually sunk and I snapped. I went off. He said they'd been seeing each other for two months and then he asked him to be his boyfriend. I was shocked. Literally. He's free to do what he wants, it's just the only that bothered me was that he was so quick to commit to this guy he met two months ago. I spent 8 whole months working on him, trying to get him to commit, and it takes this guy two months.

I went off. I cried in anger, I was sobbing uncontrollably for four hours. What did this new guy do that I didn't? Is it me? After Bill, I searched for someone to make me feel whole, loved and like I wasn't hopeless. I had met this guys in September who I though was going to be the guy to commit and after two months he just stopped talking to me.

I think I have depression and I might be bipolar (all of which hasn't been diagnosed because of how afraid I am to see someone). I've never felt lower. I just get rejected and then Bill commits making me plunge. I almost did something drastic to myself. Despite all the desire to end it, I stomached my pain and reached out to my dad. I didn't tell him about being gay, but I told him I needed help. But he tells me that maybe I should "pray more" because "God will fix it" and that I need to "rid [myself] of the Devil."

I finally got the courage to reach out, and it feels like it was made into a joke. I don't consider myself religious. I'm spiritual but I don't believe in God (if that makes sense). I prayed to him since I was 12 to make the desires for other boys go away, and since I was 15 to make my suicidal thoughts go away and to make me not so sad all the time. People say he works in mysterious ways, but making me and others like me suffer so much is plain cruel. 

Despite my dad being an ass, after the holidays, I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor and take the steps nescessary to beat these feelings. Telling him gave me the strength. I just needed somewhere to say all this. 




 I'm not going to entertain a fucking troll like yourself anymore. 




 I never said my theory was right, that's exactly why I said theory. It's my opinion and what I would think would happen in a practical situation. So excuse me Mr. Expert. But dogs CAN deliver false positives in ANY situation. Just because they're cadaver dogs doesn't make them extra special and excuse them from that probability.

I hate to break it to you, but you're also a dick. 




 ...I've done this before :/ 




 They still can deliver a false positive. I theorize that the cadaver dog would not be able to detect any further smells after they expose the dead animal because his nose would be overwhelmed. The police would probably dig, find the dog, conclude the cadaver dog gave them a false positive and move on. 




 I hope you two continue being best friends. I told my best friend during the summer after junior year and he said he still was my best friend and he'll always love me like a brother. I haven't heard from him since 2012. 




 I only met her one time though. I'm confident I won't ever feel sad about her. I feel bad for the ones she left behind, but not her. From what I remember she was a very unsavory person, but now that I know she was depressed, I can see where that image I have if her comes from. I just thought she was a bitter, angry snob. It makes more sense now. 




 I'm confident my sadness or depression stems from me being gay and having to repress it all these years. I haven't told my parents because I know how strongly they feel about homosexuality and I don't want to lose my parents over it. I know that this sort of thing only happens in extremes cases but I would consider it that due to how my parents speak about it. Whenever they have to share their thoughts on how wrong and disgusting they think all gay people are, I do get some comfort from my brother who knows. I want to tell them about the depression and my sexuality but I don't want to be hurt from the very people who are supposed to love and support me unconditionally. 




 She jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge. She was 41, I believe. I never knew her that well. I only met her once in my life back when I was in elementary school. My cousin had been diagnosed with depression some time ago and had been battling it intensely with therapy and medication. I was told by other family members closer to her that she even considered doing some form of voluntary electroshock therapy to cope with the feelings and make them go away. 

I myself have been struggling with sadness and horrible self-esteem issues. I myself have never been to a therapist because I'm too afraid of what my parents might think or say, or if they ask the reasons why I want professional help.

When you hear about someone's death, you're supposed to feel remorse, sorrow, sadness. Typically this is me too, but it was different this time because it struck a chord with me. It angered me. I became jealous of my cousin. She escaped her hell. I'm still in mine because I don't have the guts to off myself or get help. Does it make me a monster for not feeling sympathy? For being heartless? To be selfish in this way?
