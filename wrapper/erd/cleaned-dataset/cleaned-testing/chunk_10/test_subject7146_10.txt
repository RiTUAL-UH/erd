 I swear to god reddit is full of idiots and trash today. 




 No, it's not. Some fucked up child porn/snuff shit shouldn't be ok because it's fake. It's still fucked up child porn/snuff shit.  




 Dude, can you blame him? This thing is years and years old. 




 I actually have that one. I don't get much occasion to wear it though. 




 Ok, let me explain this to you in a way you might understand. See, the video was taken with a device that is known as a "smart phone", "iphone", "android", or something along those lines. When they shot the video they were holding their device vertically (that means up and down, not side to side) and so the result is a tall, skinny video. (Bonus fact: if you hold the device sideways, it will take pictures and videos that actually look right on screens.) So when the video is shown on a short, wide screen, there's nothing for the sides, usually they're just left black. But rather than  showing black, some folks will extend (extend means stretch) the edges out, or show a blurry piece of the video so it's less distracting (distracting means it draws attention away from where you're supposed to be looking.)   

Sorry about the big words. 




 Gee, that joke hasn't ever gotten old over the last 487 times I've heard it. I think it's a bit past time to let that one go. 




 That's what I use. It works with all my devices. 




 It says what I wrote, and there was a plant here once upon a time.  




 Are you looking at a different pic than me? It doesn't just end, it goes into a curve on the bottom right.  




 It's not even close to finished yet, they've only just struck it off. It's a fine job for where they're at. If you can't make it nice by the time it's done, you aren't a finisher. 




 Awesome? What does not showing a link change?  Still getting the same shit spam, never clicked the links before, this changes nothing at all.  




 Amen. Hate the e.  









 lol I just noticed you posted in Straight Talk, sorry. Well Straight Talk has terrible customer service. I kept getting the Indian folk who could only read back from their computers, they had no real knowledge or power outside of what they see on their monitors. I did some Googling and finally found a number that got me American support. They had actual knowledge and was able to help me with my activation. I was able to buy an activation kit (really just bought a code)  over the phone, and got me going. I would assume an unlocked phone would work, but it might take a bit of effort to get going.  




 I don't know if you can, but I would definitely try to activate it on Straight Talk first. Same Verizon network, half the price.  




 I remember when the Sega CD drive attachment came out, I went to our Target which had only been open a week to get one. It was $150 maybe, but rang up as a Nintendo game for $50. I saw the mistake at the counter, but didn't say anything. So I got it for 50 bucks.  

I felt a little wrong getting it, and don't do things like that anymore, but the girl saw the readout, looked at the box, gave me a look, and let me have it. So I didn't feel too much like a thief. 




 I would love to have the accumulated karma for the posts of this gif.  




 Aw, is it too hard to follow the conversation? Try harder next time, you might get it right. 




 My friend likes his, too, but it's the first non-stock mouse he's ever had, so I'm gonna give him a different one to try out, see what he thinks. 




 ...so why didn't you just ignore my comment?  




 I love how you get downvoted for not being on some gamer's dick.  

Edit : Aw, crap, I don't want to blow him either, there goes my karma...  




 Yeah, but what value does this post offer anyone? News? Entertainment? No, it's just "Yay, it's some gamer's birthday today!" What does this knowledge do for anyone?  




 My friend has this. I loathe it. It's uncomfortable and the buttons are the worst. I'm constantly changing scrolling functions when browsing.  




 I have a 1 and 2xs,they both work as well as they ever did.  




 lol Seems like a good idea, but no go. A plant isn't going spend the money to open an extra day to make their employees' jobs easier. 




 Not sure if OP is trolling or a moron.  




 Yeah, it's frozen for 24 hrs between the kill floor and cut floor. Mondays are rough, they're frozen hard from days in the cold freeze, and most all workers on the floor use knives, not bandsaws. Wrist killers. 









 Auto-reload is. It doesn't do what that script is doing, changing the speed of the reload. 




 TIL, that people really overuse, commas too often. 




 ...I have no response to any of that. And since you're starting to attack me, I'm done here. 




 Slippery slope there. If changing the functionality of the game using knowledge gleaned outside of the game isn't cheating, then they should go ahead and let us level up weapons. It's all the same, using something outside of skill to gain an advantage over other players.  
That's my outlook on it, anyway.  
And I love how redditors still don't give a shit about redditiqutte. Keep them downvotes coming. 




 I thought it was common knowledge. 




 If you're changing the speed of your reload, how is that not changing how the game works? 




 Has to be fake. You just can't trust anyone who owns bongos. 




 So your friend is a stripper? 




 I can't remove mine either. Haven't been able to for a couple months. And I only tried to remove them after none of them would work. I just moved them to the bottom, and forgot about them. Plex is probably the best way to show my stuff on tv that I can find, but it always has just felt like I've been using something in it's beta. 




 Ooooh, so he's a cheater. Running scripts that has an effect on gameplay. 




 I found [another](http://www.ebay.com/itm/1923-Coca-Cola-Soda-Water-Bottle-Lakeland-Fla-10-/371369971659?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item5677600fcb) with the exact same shape, but the wording is totally different. 




 I'm finding others, but thay have the classic hourglass shape, not the smooth, perfectly round center part. 




 [This](http://i.imgur.com/GyMR62e.jpg) is what I recently found under an old building that was torn down. It is scuffed around the wide center, but that's about it. It says "Galesburg Ill." in cursive at the base of the neck. The center says...  
GALESBURG COCA COLA  
BOTTLING CO.  
MIN. CONTENTS 6 FLU. OZ.  
BOTTLE PAT D. NOV, 8, 1923  
3323A   ROOT   2Z

Any ideas where to find info about it?
 




 Yeah, mine's always been a little screwy like that, but it's gotten worse over the last several months. I've just assumed that it's either a bug or that some specification of the audio must be incompatible, I just haven't gotten around to really researching the Plex specs.  




 Really I chalk it up to folks being too lazy to search. It's easier to ask once, and get responses from folks who know what you mean no matter your wording or nuance, than to hunt through Google hits searching for your solution. Which isn't a bad thing at all. It's when a simply worded search suffices to bring up a page full of answers that bugs me. You simply drop your legwork into someone else's lap. Er,  not you as in you, you as in anyone. You know what I mean.

 I just edit the sort title on series of movies. That way they show up however I like them to. 




 Why Hulu sucks for me

FTFY, since that's not my experience.

 I don't have any problems with straight talk that I wouldn't have with verizon, phone wise. straight talk can be a pain, the service reps are in india, read from a screen, have no real knowledge, etc. But it's verizon's carrier, so. 




 4000+ upvotes? I thought this was common knowledge. Freaking kids know nothing of practical stuff anymore.  




 2 weeks ago on .55 I couldn't. But, yeah, noticed that yesterday. I can finally hunt without a gun. Do the stones sharpen axes now?  




 How about a quick "previous bugs from .55 fixed" post? I haven't heard anything about the bows yet. 




 Also, the healing doesn't kick in until your blood level comes up enough to allow it. There are actually 3 factors that go into healing. 




 Most are perfect, excellent collection. 




 The Beggining

Movie where hobos begin to infect the world populace with nicotine stains, bad breath, and a need to sell newspapers on street corners.

 I listened to some. It's about 25% more stupid than I thought it would be. So, yeah, it's screaming. Not musical, trying to get pitches in chorus, but just screaming. 




 Military areas and large cities, don't feel bad about killing there. Everyone knows those are pvp zones, and if you're there you're rolling the dice. 




 Yeah, it sucks that bone damage doesn't regenerate. You can be healthy but 1 hit away from death because of accumulated bone damage. We have a shelf life. 




 Oh, that thing's still going? 




 The background of the steak icon will turn from red back to gray when it's done. Also, if your fire is running out of fuel, it'll never cook. It has to be 100% hot. 




 Watching the clock in the corner, the first thing that came to mind was "time flies when you're having fun." 




 I just wiped out everything, and have to re-install my extensions. As I was going through them all, I realized I really didn't *need* that many. In fact, there was only 1 I found that I absolutely had to have. Lazarus. I've lost track of the number of times it's saved me hundreds of keystrokes. So now I find myself extremely whittled down on the number of extensions. A start screen, translate, a few others, and that's it. I really don't miss enough of the others to even remember a lot of them. 




 I am certain that is wrong. There is no way someone else's kids can be related to you to the same degree as your own. 




 And yet, still long enough to confuse the blondes. 









 Peanut butter sandwiches dipped in chili. Try it, you'll see how right I am. 




 BREAKING NEWS! 




 I've moved on to Team Fortress 2. It's a completely different game, but it's the only other game that's hooked me like coh did. 




 Shouldn't this be titled "Every time someone buys a golden pan"?
