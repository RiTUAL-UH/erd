 Obama has sent a team of officials to the ISIS leaders' funeral, offering his sympathies and promising a full investigation into civil rights abuses by the Iraqi army. 




 If the Marines can't wear their uniform in America due to threat of Islamic attack, then we have lost.

Might as well put a minaret on the National Mall. 









 No criticism of Chris Rock when he was supporting Obama, but Trump says the exact same thing and the state-run media loses it. 









 It only took 4 days for the order to come and it only came after public outrage. 









 Obama sat in a pew for 20 years listening to Jeremiah "God Damn America" Wright.

Seriously, what would one expect?

 




 Hogwash. This absolutely is about 'current US politics'.

"Yesterday's heresy is tomorrow's orthodoxy." 




 You do know a Democrat has been President for 7 years? 




 Schedules change. Life is hard.  Drive on.

Do Democrats eventually want all people to stay in bed 24/7 and get airdropped food,water and money from a government drone? 









 Would a white cop helping one of the black power protestors get such aclaim?

Stop holding black people to lower standards. 




 Epidemic of black on white violence across the country -- Reddit silence.

20 people marching with a flag  -- Reddit outrage.
 









 There is no grey area or new, uncharted problem.  

We have laws already in place to handle people who sneak across our borders.

We don't need "reform", we need enforcement.
 




 It's all fun and games until it bites your face off. 




 I'm saying the exact opposite.   You are actually saying this action is okay because it's no more rogue than previous President's actions. 




 And this is why you don't compare politicians to previous politicians.

You get the type of leadership we have in Washington DC today. 









 This is what happens when a rogue President orders ICE/BP to stop enforcing laws. 









 But hey, at least we aren't racist for opposing Obamacare right?  Right?! 









 Flags lowered for Whitney Houston but not for 5 servicemen murdered in our homeland.

#nationaldisgrace

Edit: Fixed it. 









 The real growth in federal spending over the past 50 years has been entitlement spending. 









 Young people are typically more liberal because they lack the life experience that eventually makes them otherwise. 














 Obama's draft registration was an [obvious forgery](http://www.debbieschlussel.com/4428/exclusive-did-next-commander-in-chief-falsify-selective-service-registration-never-actually-register-obamas-draft-registration-raises-serious-questions/)

 









 LOL!

Good one!! 




 Why do we commend black people for doing something a responsible citizen/police officer should do? 




 More "fundamental transformation" by the Racist-in-Chief. 









 What percentage would alarm you?  5%? 20%?

100% like Somalia?

What number before you wake up? 




 Bring them in!

According to Obama, "We can absorb another terrorist attack." 









 ELI5:  What is it like for your God and your President to be the same person? 




 Contrary to your opinion, the President does not have the power to make treaties without Congress.  

Even if he is really cool. 




 Just a white person killed.  Who cares?

To use Obama's words, I guess she was just a "typical white person". 









 The petulent boy king is following his promises to create law and treaties without Congressional approval. 









 More cheese for you. 




 A random Russian mining company donated $1 million to the Clinton Foundation.

They were subsequently given uranium rights in Wyoming by the State Dept.  

Draw your own conclusions. 




 Will Walmart, Apple, etc announce a ban of Crescent flags?

Of course not.  They are boot licking cowards. 




 And the never-ending expansion of centralized government continues.

Naive Redditors praise the increased subservience to a small group of elites in Washington DC. 




 Just like Obama waited for the details to be sorted out on Trayvon Martin and Mike Brown 




 Obama called the shooting a "heartbreaking circumstance."

Disgusting. 









 Will liberals support banning the Crescent flag now? 




 "The shooter also was killed. Two law enforcement sources told CBS News that the shooting suspect was identified as Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez."

The religion of peace strikes again.

Edit: Will Obama address it?
Will he give a shout out to people beforehand like his Fort Hood address?

 Women are just as a capable as men in ground combat only in the Book of Social Justice Fairy Tales. 




 People want to work longer hours.

However, Obamacare penalizes full-time employment by making small businesses provide exorbitant health care plans to full-time workers.  How well do you think small business will do when they have to pay $2k a month per employee on health plans?

Obamacare crushes small businesses and thus its workers. 




 "Artist" 




 Except I'm just a citizen and not in a leadership position for the country.

Leadership 101:  Be inclusive to all the people you are leading. 




 The "right" in America is for limited centralized government, something I don't think Hitler would have supported. 









 Here's a hint.  Compare crime in Appalachia, the poorest area in the nation, to Baltimore, Chicago, etc. 




 Obama continues to divide America into classes. 









 The government does not produce freedom.

Your penance is 5 Declarations of Independence. 




 Liberals love free speech, provided they agree with it. 




 This is what happens when you have a rogue President that orders ICE not to enforce laws. 









 It sounds like you believe that all nations are equal. 

[I don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Asgari_and_Ayaz_Marhoni) 




 Barack Hussein Obama: First President in the history of these United States to negotiate nuclear weapons for a nation that sponsors terrorism. 









 Call me when:

A) you have kids

B) Your 8 year old boy is 100 miles away in the middle of the woods getting tucked into his tent by a homosexual man 


Now that homosexuals can lead boy scouts, can a straight man lead girl scouts?  Why not?

This decision is utter nonsense. 




 The UK will be overrun by Islam long before the freedom-killing fairy tale of 'climate change' materializes. 




 More rhetoric meant to incite class warfare and further divide the Republic.

Some people have more money than you. Get over it. 









 Climate change!!!!!! 
























 So instead of listening to him, you'll think what you are told to think. 

At least you're honest. 




 Coming to the USA is a privilege, not a right. 









 Sounds like a pleasant person. 




 You can lead a horse to water... 




 i guess Kate Steinle was just a "typical white person". 









 Obama apparently doesn't know where he was born either.

 "Income equality" is the antithesis of liberty and contrary to every principle these United States of America were founded upon. 




 "I may be drunk, Miss, but in the morning I will be sober and you will still be ugly."

Winston Churchill 




 Finite resources under control by the federal government - inevitable rationing must occur to prioritize services 














 Funny. This is not a personal blog. 

"Today's heresy is tomorrow's orthodoxy." 




 The Kurds are so happy you know what's best for them, sitting thousands of miles away in your comfortable, first-world home.

 




 Because of George Bush, ISIS is killing Iraqi women and children in Mosul? 




 Yes, the USA supplied Free Syrian Army factions with Tow missiles to fight Syrian forces.

Yes, the FSA now has the name ISIS in Western media.  They are the same force.

'In February 2015, The Carter Center listed 23 groups within the Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army that have been documented using US supplied TOWs.[23]'

Edit: Would love to hear the Obama followers explain how American TOWs w/  scratched off serial numbers made it to Syria.
