 Yep. Looking at his filmography, I have. Definitely a name I'll look out for from now on. 




 I don't believe I've ever seen one of his films before now. If any of them are like this, I'm pretty interested in seeing his other works! 




 The movie is really emotional and does have a lot of action. JG put on an awesome performance and was super believable! 




 All I can say is wow. Jake Gyllenhaal is unrecognizable from his character in Nightcrawler and did a phenomenal job which just goes to show the range he can achieve. While the plot is a little predictable, the movie really is great and the performances are very believable (especially from the daughter, Oona Laurence). On a final note, James Horner's score was amazing and really added to the feel of the whole movie. As someone who's not really into sports films, this movie really was wonderful and I recommend you all go see it if you get the chance. 




 And that's true. You don't really even need to know who Max is to enjoy the movie. But if you're looking for backstory, the other movies are where to go. 




 I really disliked it. I felt it was trying really hard to be deep and vulgar and just ended up coming off as, for lack of a better word, conceited. 




 With the no back story thing, you do realize this is the fourth movie in a franchise, right? 




 You fuckin bet! 









 If you like Sci Fi, they're both definitive films and really great! 




 Wow, it's cool seeing these guys on here. I remember them handing out demos outside a concert I'd gone to years ago! 




 Awesome! Hope you enjoy. :) 




 I love it! It's a really clever and funny show. I think you can watch it for free on Adult Swim's website if you want to check it out. 









 That Terminator bust is sick! 




 HUH, I didn't know this was a theory. That's just how I always thought it was. 









 I had no idea people didn't like Quantum of Solace. I thought it was pretty good. 




 My Questions is my favorite song off of Dead Throne. That ending is so intense. 




 I fucking love Celldweller. 




 I started doing it ironically and now I just do it because I'm used to it so it isn't ironic anymore.  




 Exactly! 




 Think of it like war drums. It's purely there to boost the morale of their own soldiers and put fear into the hearts of their enemies. 




 WRX buddy! I have a 2004 :) 




 You're definitely right about the sequel, but I like the first movie. 




 All of those are designs submitted by redditors and 4chan users. 




 Oh, I know. It's from the trailer. I just wanted to keep the title concise. 




 Yeah, I think I saw another post in the new section that was a gallery of screenshots. 




 I haven't played online a lot recently but feel free to add me!

GAH2009 









 No, I had it a long time ago, too. 




 Not at all. 




 I know! They seem like such fun little cars. 




 No, but just laughing in their face could seriously fuck with their self esteem. I know it would mine. It's not like they *know* she has a boyfriend or anything. 




 If I'm not mistaken, the Capuccino is legal to import now, isn't it? 




 Mission Impossible 3 




 There's a preorder bonus. It's just some other car parts, though. 




 Man, I love that red. 




 I know it's not exactly what you're looking for, but you should definitely check out Wasteland 2. It's a really great game. It's an RPG with turn based combat instead of 4x though, if that's a deal breaker. 




 Would you say it was... Viral marketing? 




 JC2 and GTA don't use the same models or physics. 




 Gosh, he killed it in that movie. I love it! 




 The buildup is no doubt because it's been raining here everyday for a good while. Assuming these are recent pictures. 




 Yes! Oh, man I really want a matching set for the trilogy! 




 I just checked and couldn't find it. Are you sure? 




 Damn, I wish I got that Guardians one. :/ 




 Don't hold me to this, but I swear I heard he was working on something now. 




 I can see why they did. Big Hollywood film where the last human on Earth is the bad guy makes it hard to relate to. I think it would've been great had they done the book's way, though. 




 I'm having amazing fun with it, but I have one complaint. What the fuck happened to being able to pause cutscenes? Like in any game? 




 Hey! I was born on my dad's birthday! 




 Jesus, could you be a little more condescending to someone you know little to nothing about? 




 Damn, that's a lot of stuff xD 




 Oh ok. Thanks for clearing that up! 




 So do we have to buy new players in order to use these discs? 




 And my fucking math book came with no bindings. Reselling that's gonna be impossible. 




 I think the 25th Anniversary one came with digital copies. I'm not completely sure, though. We have them all on our iTunes, but I can't remember if we got those somewhere else or with that trilogy. 




 Mm, so euphoric. 




 Are you saying they refused to marry you because you weren't on their records as a regular attendee? 




 Same. Some people do really stupid stuff in dangerous conditions. 




 Yeah. I can see that. For playing what feels like the same role, he's very good at that role. 




 I love his stuff, but I wish he put out content more often. 




 I've never understood the obsession with him. He's a pretty average actor of you ask me. 




 I've never had anyone say anything about it. Most people don't care, but there's always a chance you'll get someone that's a little too serious about these things.  




 Breaking her in early, huh? 




 It's just in my windshield. I don't necessarily like that either, but I think it looks better than being mounted on the front. 




 Haha! Yeah, we're getting a little sun where I am now. Still crazy. 









 That's a beautiful car, dude! I'm jealous. 




 You're right. Reddit kind of sucks because people like you always feel the need to say something rude instead of keeping their mouths shut and moving on. 




 Shut your goddamn mouth. That car is ridiculously cool. 




 I actually went to high school with one.  Her opinions were really stupid and annoying, but it's not the same as the internet portrays it. 




 Was the first Evil Dead really a comedy? I felt like they were trying to make a legitimate low budget horror film that just ended up being ridiculous and they went with it with the sequels. Or did they do it on purpose? 




 Same, I had one show up from the dead 4 or 5 times. 




 Well, then I guess you buy a new one. They're like $8. But what if it's the Stratavarious of recorders? Then what? HUH? 




 Hey, that's not too bad. BF4 only had 10 when it came out. 




 Why would you let go of any instrument as sophisticated as the recorder? 




 Mom: Porsche Panamera 4

Dad: soon-to-be Porsche Macan

Sister: Jeep Patriot

Me: 2004 Subaru WRX Sedan 




 It's a bra and it just protects the paint on the front of the car. 




 Whoa. Someone should make all three into a wallpaper! 




 Hah it's like the definition of a first world problem. 

"I didn't get the right color case on my Blu Ray and now I'm pissed" 




 /u/trollabot test_subject7429 




 I'm jealous, man.  I got the slip, but not the red case for Birdman. 




 I don't know if it's actually her favorite, but she enjoys Harry Potter enough to watch them all over the course of a few days like twice a year. 




 It was the same for me when I got my first car.  Had never even heard of the Suzuki SX4 before.  BUT EVERYONE HAS ONE. 




 A group of my teachers from senior year of high school went to trivia regularly, as did students.  They got hammered half the time. 




 I failed the first time because I was a nervous wreck. I was trying to remember everything and in doing that I tried to turn left into oncoming traffic... Twice. But I took the test again the very next day and did an almost perfect run! 




 I saw them on their current tour, and I have to respectfully disagree with you. I was expecting what you're talking about and he exceeded my expectations. Mike absolutely kills it live. 




 That movie was a fucking masterpiece. 




 Yep, my dad too. "Why'd he do that?" "It's in the script." 




 I went with my mom because she wanted to see it. God, that movie is so *long.* 




 \*subaru rumble* 




 Shitty student. Don't know what I want anymore. 




 Not any males. For whatever reason I don't feel comfortable opening up to guys. I do have two female friends that I can talk to about most things, though. 




 Spartans of the road, man. 




 Sorry, but that sounds like Nero from DMC4
