 This sounds like a troll though. But if it isn't, then *shakes head* 

However, I have come across a number of fellow Chinese singaporeans making comments like "not that I am racist but Malays are lazier"...(context: when recruiting people I have met HR people and hiring managers that judge Malays just for being Malays even before the interview)

I get very upset at such statements, especially coming from otherwise seemingly civilised "nice" people.
