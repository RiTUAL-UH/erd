 People don't get hit points or skill points. You train and get better with your class skill, simple as that.  




 I love it. Ingrained classism. A fighter breaks off from his combat classes to hang out with a mage and rogue. They become adventuring 'brothers'.  




 The classes are strictly adhearing to those found in Dungeons and Dragons 




 "Oh, look at the Ice Mage everyone! Jesus, this guy can't go on a date without making nipplecicles!" 




 Yeah, I'm considering writing a biweekly series on my website! 




 What if monsters either appeared or some animals become extremely violent or mutant into monsters?  




 Necromancers are renowned for being super creepy. People tend not to like them and necromancers tend to stay away from other classes and train with each other. Bards are seen as silly but somewhat useful, like Aquaman. I'm not sure if school should even be a thing anymore, since tutelage and apprenticeship under a more experienced class member would do good for a younger one. Magic users would have labs and facilities for testing magic and research and rogues would have guilds and underground operations.    




 There are no 'normal' people. Everyone is some sort of class, even if the ability is rather lame or limited. Since the class is known at birth, kids couldn't hide their class from the family. Magical classes are stronger politically than the other races, but most are far more concerned with magic, like scientists.  Fighters have larger populations, with rogues and thieves being second.  




 I could see sports becoming far more brutal. Fighters would be prized in that position, weapons would be allowed and the field would be rigged with traps. Clerics would be standing by for a quick revive or healing gaping wounds.  




 She'd break out and join a thieves guild. Oh, think about how kids nowadays accept others despite their differences. You'd have 'adventurer parties' formed at a young age by kids in various classes and races, banding together. Think about high school, and how you had a group of friends who banded together. Now imagine that but with a teenage knight, warlock, thief and bard.  




 I could see an argument between a teenage mage and his fighter class parents playing out like the classic 'coming out' discussion that ends with the kid being kicked out for being a mage. "No son of mine is going to practice 'fairy' magic!" 




 EVERYONE is born with a class. There isn't a set pattern either. A child of two barbarian class people might be a rogue or mage. I was also thinking that somethings would regress somewhat, like schooling would slow to a crawl due to kids being more interested in their abilities and undertaking quests than learning, or doctors being replaced with Clerics. 




 I don't know, that's what's scaring me now. I don't now how they got him, and I don't want to know. 




 Hey World Builders,

I had a concept for a new rpg where character classes are applied to people in the modern day, giving them abilities and powers associated to the class. The assigned class is shown on a unremovable tattoo on the forearm that manifests at birth. My question is, what would the ramifications be in this world? Would divides between character classes start manifesting?  




 What would your superpower and costume be as well? 




 I had just graduated high school when I got my first job. In my small town, it was the only job that would accept a kid like me with little work experience, so I took it. My daily work consisted of the typical jobs at a gas station. I would take out the trash, ring up customers at the register and stock the cooler. I actually enjoyed every aspect of the job, but one problem remained, my boss, Todd. 

Todd was a overweight man with pockmarked and sallow skin. He constantly smelled of beer and cheap cigarettes. Although he was my manager and boss, I held no respect for him because of his attitude and blatant racism. Whenever he could mistreat the Mexican day laborers who would come in for refreshments, he told me and my coworker, Cisco, to raise the prices on sodas and Gatorade. Other times, he would make demoralizing remarks about African Americans, even within ear shot of me. He would try and backpedal, but I knew his intent. One day when the day laborers came in, I gave them all free drinks as a 'fuck you' to Todd. The next day when I came in, I saw that he'd put me on night shift for that Saturday. 

It wasn't bad for the first few hours. Cisco and Lee, my friends from the dayshift and fellow Todd sufferers, stopped by to spend sometime with me. We played some Pathfinder like we usually did when things got slow, but as the evening got on, they went home. It was around nine at night when I heard the scratching from the freezer. I was stationed at the cashier with 'The Mountains of Madness' when the scratches kept getting louder. I got up and headed into the back. The freezer had a large metal door that was at least four inches thick, made out of steel. I knocked on it. 

"Cisco, is that you?" I called. Cisco had the habit of getting locked in the freezer, but he'd gone home several hours ago. I tried to think about what the hell could be in there, but it didn't make sense. The backdoor wasn't left open, so raccoons couldn't get in, and I was in the front, no one could slip past me unnoticed. The rasping on the door got louder and I could hear the shuffling of something on the other side. No, not shuffling, a wet sucking sound, like a wet suction cup on a hard surface. I gripped the handle and wrenched open the freezer, but instead of the rows of sodas and bottled coffee, I saw- well I'm still not sure what I saw. 

It looked to be a world entirely of meat and sinew. It was a vast, red expanse, like a desert. It quivered every so often, like how a horse twitches it's rump. In the expanse of red were house sized lumps that occasionally spurted yellow fluid, like a geyser. In the sky hung a large grey planet with black spikes sticking out of the sides, like a cartoon sun. But then I saw the being in front of me. It was like a massive sea anemone, with a wide conical base that tapered into a meaty point dotted with yellow pinpricks. Suction cupped tentacles hung from the larger base, waving around without a sense of direction. In the center of the base was a sideways mouth that hung open, lined with fangs. On it's back were what appeared to be yellowish lumps that quivered and writhed as if they were alive. As I stared at the creature, I saw that there were others like it in the background, surrounding one of the house sized tumors. The tumor shook and suddenly split open as a pink humaniod thing slid out and on to the fleshy ground, shaking and screaming obscenities in english. I looked closer and realized it was Todd! His overweight body was covered in a thick film of pink slime that quivered as he tried to crawl away. The creatures surrounded Todd and began tearing into him mercilessly as he howled and cried. After a second, the sounds stopped and were replaced by the wet crunches and tearing of those monsters. The creature in front of me seemed to get it's bearings and lashed out with a tentacle, but I slammed the freezer door as hard as possible, before pushing my body against it. The door managed to slam shut with a hiss, but when I looked down, I saw the end of the purple tentacle, wriggling around on the floor like a lizard's tail. I grabbed one of the mason jars we sold in the store and managed to carefully contain. I hid it in my closet and didn't tell anyone.

 I eventually forgot about the tentacle as I quit the job and moved on with my life. I recently came home after my first year of college at University of North Texas. As I drove into town past my place of former employment, I suddenly remembered my secret. I raced home and ran into my room, not even saying hello to my very confused family. I wrenched open my closet door and dug through the piles of clothes to find an shattered mason jar.      
  




 Hey World Builders,

Working on a modern day werewolf series. The werewolves in universe live in various hidden communities across the world, in out of the way places. I'm wondering what those communities could look like and how they'd accept new werewolves.  




 They exist in Pantaria. It's implied that at one point they were more invested in lower beings, but now they don't really care, like a worker who doesn't give a shit about their job.  




 Interesting. Like being a werewolf is similar to Firestorm, where the wolf side is riding shotgun and the human side is in control, fighting the urges? 




 What was the point of telling me this? I need help, not snarky asides. 




 Blood Moon wolves. The only werewolf who can eat other wolves to gain their powers.  




 Love the idea! It's canon! 




 The werewolves won't be well known, they're hidden. They exist in the same universe with mages and have a rivalry with them. The wolf monsters could become somewhat stable, but a complete cure couldn't work, the wolf side is too strong to ignore.  




 I consider the fact that either they become wolf-men monsters or crazy people to be old hat. I want to update werewolf lore. I had the idea of an academy for young werewolves to learn about control, to use their abilities for the good of mankind. I was also wondering about the human side of being a werewolf and how they could use traits like super senses or speed to help take down criminals.   




 I have. They're an enemy type caused by a magic malfunction. 




 Hey worldbuilders,

I'm working on a rpg where the player is a new werewolf. I'm wondering, any ideas on how I can make werewolves more interesting in terms of abilities or powers? 




 If you want a really cool desert city, check out Valia. It's a industrial city run by dark elves hovering above the desert. Entry is around 25 gillions for a gryphon ride up there and you can stay in a luxury resort. Fox-Cliff is only cool to visit for the history and the thieves guild demonstrations, but the nightlife is fantastic. If reading is your idea of a good time, check out the Library of Reality. There, you can check out any kind of book from the multiverse. If magic instrests you, you can go to the Wizard Conservatory and Testing Labratories.  




 You have my attention..... 




 I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords. 




 Science, ladies and gentlemen. The same field that created airplanes and robots.  




 Felicity and I ducked behind a row of bushes outside the school, hoping that the barbarians didn't see us. Ever since the 'Classification' as people called it, happened, things changed. There was no school system anymore, because everyone was relegated to their class. Mages joined other mages in magic studies and training. Warriors began to work together to protect the streets and develop swords and other weapons. The thieves and rouges began to form guilds and train others in their ways. But some, like me and my friends, worked as a team. Instead of sectioning ourselves off, we joined forces and decided to use our combined abilities to take on quests. Our former math teacher turned Cleric, Mrs. Allison, had given us a new quest. A few mages had taken over the local High School and were performing some dangerous experiments. We'd agreed to the quest and now Felicity and I were scoping out the area. 

"I've got two barbarians on the ground in the front of the school." I whispered into a communication rune our mage friend Barry had made. Felicity placed a hand on my shoulder and I looked up and gasped in horror. The front doors had opened and a guy around our age was making his way down the steps, his face hidden by a skull mask. 
  "Necromancer." I whispered, trying to keep the fear out of my voice. Necromancers were a feared class by everyone. Mages kept their distance and often wouldn't allow necromancers into their training grounds. As a result, Necros as people called them, were outcasts, relegated to living in abandoned buildings. It was a sad fact, but when you can summon zombies, not everyone wants you around. The Necro turned and faced the barbarians. The two warriors looked like they must've been former football players, they were built without an ounce of fat on them. They wore the armor of a mercenary, grey with a red arm band on the left arm, battle axe's at the ready. 
"You idiots, the questing party is already here!" he snarled in a high raspy voice. "I scried for them!" He pointed a finger in our direction and launched a ball of blue flame in our direction. I pulled Felicity lower and we both felt the back of our necks become super heated as the ball flew over our heads. 

"Open fire!" I heard the familar thwang! of a crossbow string and looked to see Frank, our team's archer, holding his crossbow level; his green hoodie up. I heard a howl of pain and turned to see one of the barbarians on the ground, holding his bloodied knee. Danny and John, our two warriors engaged the other barbarian in combat, screaming like banshees. 

"No, no, no!" the necromancer screamed. "Goddamn it, I have to do everything MYSELF!" he screamed, his hands crackling with black lighting. Felicity jumped the bushes and ran towards him, her hands becoming a shade of frosty blue. She flung her fist outward, releasing a shower of icy spikes towards the necromancer, but he acted faster and erected a solid wall of force, shattering the ice. Danny and John had managed to take down the barbarian and were now focusing on the necromancer's shield. Frank's bolts bounced off harmlessly and Felicity's ice magic just slid off.

"It's no good, we can't break it!" Danny shouted, and I grinned. "Stand back! Let me try!" I shouted, drawing out my lute. The necromancer regarded me for a moment and laughed. "What the hell are you going to do with that?" he snarled. I smirked and began plucking the lute strings, weaving the notes with my voice as I began to sing, imagining the two sounds merging as one. Then I screamed as loud as I could, forcing the magic into the shield, completly destroying it. The necromancer was so distracted, my scream had managed to send him flying into a parked car, knocking him unconscious.  John and Danny hoisted the necromancer onto their shoulder after tying him up.
"Nice work for a bard." Felicity said jokingly. I chuckled and looked at my lute. "You think I should upgrade?"
"Nah, your pretty badass with it." her communication rune vibrated and she squeezed it in her hand. 
"New quest guys!" she announced. "An Overlord as been spotted."
  




 Hey World Builders,

Working on a table top RPG about shapeshifters. Any ideas on how I can make different animals with unique abilities for the player?
 Here's a link for a post I made describing the world, it's a bit of a wall of text, I apologize: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/3d2pci/urban_fantasy_world_with_animal_morphers/ 




 Hey Writers of Reddit,

I'm working on a new story set in a alternate version of the 16th century. Dinosaurs never went extinct, and are used by humans in place of animals like bulldogs, mules, ect. Racial diversity is also different, as slavery happened much earlier in the timeline. As a result, blacks and asians are relatively common in London. Some people have superhuman abilities ranging from psychic to invisibility, but keep them hidden due to persecution from the church. London is the primary setting, and the protagonists are a group of street urchins who are taken in as squires by a rich lord who is funding a trip to the 'New World'. Not sure where to go, any ideas are appreciated.   




 What do you think about white people who consider themselves Native American due to being 1/14th Cherokee or some other tribe? And how are names given? 




 Not sure if anyone has thought of this before, but Elon certainly seems like Harrison. Think about all the technology he's introduced over the past couple of years. Paypal, affordable electric cars, believes that humanity has a greater destiny and believes in extraterrestrial life. He also seems to be against artificial intelligence. So what do you guys think?   




 Hey Redditors,

Working on a new world for a RPG/Book series and wanted to share it! It's still in the planning stages, so any input would be appreciated!

The world is like ours, with modern technology and cities. Some humans called Pookas, have the ability to become one animal at will. When their animal form manifests in early childhood, they are taken to a Pooka Academy to be trained to control their ability. A Pooka's animal form is limited to one animal and so far, only birds and mammals are the only animals they can become. Once their ability is apparent, they become targets for the Altiri, a race of monsterous beings that predated humanity and Pookas. 

Magic is also in the universe, but it's similar to the Speedforce. It's apart of a whole, and serious misuse can do a lot of damage. As a result, magic spells are linked to medallions that carry a 'charge' of magic used for a specific spell. For example, a player can use a 'luck enhancement' medallion to alter probability to their favor or a 'fire bolt' medallion to generate a bolt of intense heat. Magic is also used by the Pooka community to cloud the minds of humans if their cover must be broken in public. 

Weaponry is typically designed to combat Altiri, such as swords, daggers, axes and hammers, but animal forms are preferred for close range combat. Guns are sometimes used, but aren't all that useful against Altiri and their minions.  

The Altiri were, as said before, beings who predated humanity. It is unknown where they came from, but what is known is that they once had immense cities and palaces all around the world. They worshipped great and powerful beings rivaling the Old Ones. But Pooka abilities manifested in early humans, and they drove the proud race underground, erasing all traces of them. 

The Altiri come in four flavors, 

The Tall Ones: nine foot tall humanoids with white fur, pointed ears and curved horns. They are capable shape shifters and able to mimic humans, often implanting themselves within government ranks. They are largly seen leading armies, hardly fighting hand to hand. They have the biggest distain for humans and Pookas and are very sadistic.

The Durge: Durge's resemble grey skinned humans. They have three toes and glowing yellow eyes without pupils. They are the fighting force of the Altiri and are highly resistant to pain, being able to wade into magma and have no problems. The Durge are simple, but capable of somewhat complex thought, as several Durge's have been noted to simply let an opponent tire themselves out in combat due to the high pain threshold. 
 
The Rot: The Rot, put simply are zombie-like beings with high intellect. They are master strategists with a odd fascination with human technology, noting it's great capacity for destruction. They wear purple and black cloaks at all times, and their left arm is surrounded by fatty tissue. 

The Lost Ones: The Lost are being who look like humans, but who's eye are in the wrong places on their bodies. They are rarly seen above ground, but when they are spotted, they lurch around and seem to be in a euphoric state. It is assumed that they are used for slave labor and used to by humans. 

That's all I have time for now, but please, ask questions!

  




 My superhero universe is heavily influenced by DC comics and Marvel as well as Hellblazer for the supernatural side. I've got metahumans, mutants, aliens and magic users in every corner of the universe, and that's not counting the Powers of Olympus and Asgard. The superheroes of the universe are similar to the ones on the show Powers, being celebrities and public figures. Sidekicks are seen as a formality, and villains and heroes are seemingly obliged to have young people as either proxies or companions in adventures. I also have a 'Savage Land' expy known as 'The Island', a place where super strong and animal powered villains are housed.

My fantasy world is similar to Discworld, with the ridiculous magic system and crazy characters. The theme of 'the hero has the flu, the janitor or intern's gotta save the world' is a major theme. I've also sprinkled in a dash of Lemoney Snicket's narration and trademark dark humor. 

My Science Fiction universe is similar to Korra era Avatar, with a class of humans and Vetari (blue skinned humanoid aliens) with elemental powers.  The technology and style is inspired by Borderlands, with a rustic yet futuristic flare, as is the megacorperations rule over various systems. The protagonist's ability was inspired by DC comic's hero Firestorm.
