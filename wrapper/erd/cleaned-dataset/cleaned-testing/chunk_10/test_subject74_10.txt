 * If you're into drug store stuff...Definitely Herbal Essences 'naked' shampoo and conditioner. 


* If you use salon stuff, bedhead was always my favorite...S factor smooth/shine products would be perfect from the sounds...All bedhead stuff smells delicious enough to eat as well! 


* Andddd, hair gets tangled easier the longer it is...Maybe try to keep it up when exposed to wind etc. That might help a bit as well 




 She's flaming hot as a ginger. Unff.  




 It is! :) 









 Premade Naan Pizza Crust, Garlic butter, and mozzarella cheese! 














 I'm non customer facing I.T., so I can have studs in my nose and dye in my hair! ^.^ 




 Thank you!! :) 




 Nice!  









 Heh! :D 




 Yeah, that definitely is a happy ending for everyone but him! ;) 




 Yeah, without a doubt. :( 




 Welp, what did anyone expect? He was a nazi bastard, its not surprising.  




 Someone should tell you you're a rude troll and this jewelry can be used for many things that are larger gauge...Yes, including dicks. But, really though? It's a large gauge captive bead barbell...Its not that provocative...  




 No problem! And that's the worst, sometimes I sneak on my side anyway(I've got 'tragus' dermals, stretched ears etc) and if you get in the perfect middle between two pillows its not too bad. But, its dangerous because sleeping you will fuck it up!  




 This should be in r/jokes ;P 




 1.Don't ever use alcohol on it, invest in a good saline solution...(h20 or wound spray)
2. Don't touch or play with it
3.Don't put creams on it
4. Sleep on the other side of your body, back, or face.
5. Keep it really clean! Don't submerge it in pools etc. 




 Either get a 'fade' in the sense that its shaved more into a layered look or get it thinned into layers if you're not comfortable with being buzzed again...Or like someone else suggested style it. Another option would be to make it wisped with the thinning sheers...like twist the hair and then cut to get a wispy look. 




 Make it into a fine powder, and force them to snort it? Then hay maker them into oblivion... 




 Money so I could make it rain on the entire world and space. ;) 




 Yes, its like a new piercing for the first two weeks after a stretch so being unable to wear jewelry while trying to upsize is nearly impossible. 


Pretty sure, however you would probably already know more than me because I have tiny little 00g lobes. lol 




 I can't lie, I picked up on this as soon as she was introduced...Like, the actress is as well... 




 You did the thing, thank you kindly!  




 You're welcome! :) 




 Now...If he had both that would be even more terrifying.  




 From box dye to barbie. Nice! :)
