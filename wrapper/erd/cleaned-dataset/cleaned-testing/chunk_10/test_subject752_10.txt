 Oh noes, my precious wee one has to suffer because I can't double park against a car which is parked on broken yellow lines while I hold up the traffic behind me while I open the door for my princess. 




 If you have limited funds perhaps something reliable may be better... I have a 2005 1800cc caldina you'd pick one up around that, great wagon, feed her 98 and she's away laughing. 

Plenty of guts to cruise at 110 on motorway, even on the infamous Dunedin kilmog. 

Gets around 550km /tank for around a hundred bucks around town.

 Mazda's command a high price in Japan, so they tend to be more expensive than worth it. 




 And if something the doctors had given him that interacted badly with the cannabis oil he could have died. But hey, she got her ulterior motive firmly in the spotlight, so whatever right?

No. For the same reason you don't mix alcohol with sleeping tablets, you don't just self medicate after trusting the professionals to do their damn job, how incredibly insulting of her to undermine their ability to treat her son by giving him her own medication!?

If I were her doctors I would be absolutely livid this woman potentially put my career on the line for her own selfish agenda. 




 Whatever it is, Greece has fucked their citizens for many years, their young will leave in droves, who wants to support their country if their country cannot support themselves?  




 And how do you know the people writing the laws are in bed with those who  want disproportionate sentences for petty crime? Ah, unjust prison sentences! Beautiful. 

Fucking pathetic paedophile loving little fucktards.  














 At the very least it would require them to land immediately and run system checks. I understand they're designed to ingest carcasses and water, but ideally not flammable metal and batteries!

Edit: they can't land full, so need to eject water and fuel before landing, hence wasted trip.  




 Ok, then perhaps I was too harsh! I apologise. My wife's come home with some horrible stories -neighbors at war when 1 neighbour brings in "absolutely feral cat" and the next day they find out they knew it was a loved cat, but hated cats so stole it and took it to the spca anyway...  




 It's funny, my partner used to work for the SPCA and if she had a dollar for every time someone said that, and it turned out to be a loved pet.. 

Did you put up flyers at all? 

Put a notice in your local supermarket? 

Knock on the doors of your neighbors? 




 Edit: they checked with the neighbors so I was out of place chastising them! Removed comment as totally unfair and uncalled for sorry op!  









 The LIPO /lithium ion batteries for a start are explosive when punctured, and the hundreds of high grade aluminium/steel parts would wreak an engine spinning at a few thousand rpm's. 

Then factor in like a go pro as well with a second battery as well as everything else and it'll certainly involve landing instantly to confirm damage!  




 Fully, they will have no-one else to blame either!  




 Yeah man, one of those sucked into the air intakes and you're toast!  









 I'll happily pick up 99% of spiders I see in the house and take them outside. Whitetails get the boot. Every time.

 Our eyesight and accompanying neural processing can cope with and identify hazards traveling much much faster than our ancestors could ever wish of going. E.g everyday driving, right up to specialised speed related activities like flying aircraft/car racing etc.

How are our eyes able to cope with a significantly higher demand than our environment has ever placed on it for millions of years of evolution? 




 You're a real catch you next Tuesday. 









 Business are criminal these days, you cannot justify a 15% pay rise (and that's excluding  (660k of 4.18M$) as "Market rates" since when the fuck did "Market rates" become the go-to excuse for eye watering astronomical salaries?

Your salary should reflect your ability to do a job (he says with a laugh). I know better than that, and I know we're not in an ideal world. Simple fact is keep the shareholders happy and they will ensure you get whatever you want in terms of payment. 

The Business world is built upon: You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. 









 This is the first I've heard of it in NZ, it hasn't been on our news radar at all. 
























 Indeed, the whole cycle perpetuates itself - the last straight car runs the red, causing the right turn people to feel like they deserve to run the red. 

The thing is it's beyond people just being cheeky and running the orange, they're fully entering the intersection when the lights are red/have been red for a few seconds. Which is just bloody dangerous.. 




 And looking to the right panel we see..:

32 points (70% upvoted)

Yip way to prove OP's point guys. Well played. 




 Uhm. What? 

There are methods available to her to liquidate the equity in her home, but that would eat into the entitled little shits inheritance.

Honestly, she has more worth than I am likely to ever see in my lifetime, would there have been the same sob story if it was a middle aged couple struggling to pay the mortgage?

At least she gets the pension from the government, try getting help as a struggle middle class! 




 I appreciate your take on this, I wish I had half your optimism! Thanks!  




 Indeed, you've noticed that too?? -Rain brings out the dicks!

But yes, the right turn is especially bad for red light runners. 




 Ah, Chch, makes perfect sense. I have encountered said Neanderthal on occasions. 

Usually preceeded by "Have you got a ciggy bro?" (Or a couple dollars for the bus.) When I inevitably say no, it's the same thinly veiled aggressive response. 

I feel like saying:

"Dafaq cunt? Was your family so incredibly dysfunctional you weren't taught the basics of how to to talk and interact with humans?

However it ends up come out like: 

"..Mumblesomethingunintelligible.."

.. I am not a strong man and have no desire to be stabbed. 




 lol! Oh dear, freudian slip perhaps? 




 Not an isolated incident, but was just out for a walk down Clarence Street.

Some fucking holier than thou cunt in a new 4x4 something turned right (From Clarence to Blenheim) a couple seconds after the red as the "Cross" symbol was green and I'd started walking.

Next time, I'll fucking kick your car ya cunt.

Seriously though, what the hell is with Chch people and their inherent fuck the lights attitude?!?  




 NZ is definitely without a doubt one of the more desirable countries to own property in. 

I think had it not been for the Chch EQ's and subsequent WLG EQ that people would probably be investing more.

I mean some of the beach front properties in Redcliff's sold for a fraction of what a similar beachfront property sells for overseas.

Above it all, the human population is always growing, however the amount of habitable land is constant. This alone is enough to have the price increase. 




 There was a glut in the market, there's now not a glut. Economics 101.

Did they honestly think the supply would never catch up with demand? 














 "National MPs, 40 of whom own investment properties, are unlikely to take the view that house-price inflation is a bad thing." 

*But that doesn't constitute a conflict of interest. /s* 




 Can confirm, popped into Dev - running apps and Snapchat is running at full 2 x 2.2GHZ for like 5 minutes after running on GS5.

Fucking annoying having to force kill it.

 * Check your tyre pressure - Most tyres run 32 PSI. You can run higher (I run mine at 38 PSI) but you will get a bumpier ride.
You can normally find your tyre pressure by the Drivers side door latch. (When you open the door, look at the latch mechanism beside your hip and there may be a sticker denoting your PSI/KPI levels)

* If you're driving in a straight line, and you let go of the wheel, does the car noticeable lurch/start to turn itself to either the left/right in a very noticeable way? Then your wheel alignment is out, and this will be causing uneven wear on your tyres.

* If you don't want to fork out around 70-100 dollars for a wheel alignment, then you can put it off by rotating your tyres - from front right to rear left, front left to rear right and vice versa. (Note: ensure the direction arrows on the sidewall are adhered to!)

* Buy fuel when it's as cold as possible, (first thing in the day, or at night.) fuel expands as it gets hot, as as you pump per litre rather than weight you can save *maybe a litre* over a tank just by topping up during the coldest point of the day.

* 91 vs 95/98* honestly 99% of the time you're not going to notice the difference. I've found on a long journey at 100km/h then I did get an extra 50km from 98 (over a 650km tank) compared to 91 with a 2005 Toyota Caldina. But that advantage would quickly be pissed away as around town the vast majority of your energy is accelerating, in which case the difference isn't so pronounced. Therefore if you're looking save cash 95/98 isn't going to help you!

*I think this question alone sparked the phrase "YMMV" (Your Mileage May Vary) lol. 









 No I simply got interrupted. But thanks for the assumption. I'm sure I could find a study where finding racism in things that aren't racist is also racist?  




 If the N1 is anything to go by, hopefully they'll lean towards Android! 



















 It's extremely complicated.

You've got a variety of market forces and different brackets at play which makes for a clusterfuck of opinions.

In one corner you've got the folk who own property in the hot spots, and are watching their investment grow an enviable $1000's of dollars a month.

In another corner you've got the simple fact that people of asian descent dominate our property auctions. 

And another coincidence is this perception is further amplified by the "top sales people" in most realtors again of Asian descent. After 4 years in retail I can say without an iota of racism that Asians buy almost exclusively from Asian salespeople. I've had customer's who walk up to the nearest asian looking sales person and exclusively buy from them. If there were none available, **they would actually have the balls to ask if there were any asian sales people and leave if there weren't!!**.

You've got the devout labour supporters who are simply following the leader by crying foul with the latest stats simply because they have an interest in getting rid of National and supporting Labour.

You've got National Supporters who again are just crying foul because the allegations came from Labour and are loving the racist card in all of this, which is course a giant side show and detracting from Labour's primary message of "Foreign home Ownership" rather than just a good old Chinese bash-up like National are desperately trying to depict.

You've got Labour themselves who are trying desperately to stay relevant in the facing of falling poll results and are willing to post ANYTHING controversial to try and sway the voters by posting potentially defamatory statements against Asians by pigeon-holing people by their last names in an attempt to pull on the public's very hot topic of house prices (Obviously not who are in the first category of watching their investment grow however)

And you've got the young and old or homeless/renters who are rapidly coming to the realisation that no matter what their dream of owning a home is being dashed. 
Whether or not they believe it due to foreign home ownership they just know the National Bank are very very very happily fucking them over with a deep heated coated broom handle by instating LVR resrictions, despite the fact I'd bet my left nut the Banksknow damn well it's the overseas buyers an speculators who are driving up houses prices, but they that's ok because the Bank are still making money hand over fist!

The Government knows damn well there's a problem with speculators and developers (hence the half hearted attempt at a capital gains tax they implemented earlier this year.) however their unwillingness to even look at a register of foreign home buyers should actually show you how desperate they are for the truth not to come out - that our country is very much up for the highest bidder, and the cashed up people are buying up WORLD WIDE and this is affecting the Kiwi's ability to buy a house.

All in all, there's a fucking massive problem, our government are burying their head in the same, our young are being fucked hard with the rising cost of living, coupled with a government who don't give a fuck about keeping jobs on shore, and parents who constantly try and apply their own morals to their offspring without either giving a fuck, or honestly believe it's possible to own your home on your average wage by the time you're 30.

 How the fuck can you go 9 months living as a freedom camper!? 




 Often licked never beaten 









 Awesome, thanks man! I understand, I have a Nikon Dslr and photographing one would be just a satisfying 




 How did you find out about this? It's on my bucket list to the see the Aurora Australis here in Chch. 









 The fuck are you on about?  









 Ah. Nasty. That sucks 




 TIL Cilantro is another name for coriander!

But that's tough, especially as most of those must be used in a considerable amount of flavourings/foods as an enhancer. 




 What happens if you do? 









 Why should people bother to graduate then? 

You get a higher education to show employers that you're head and shoulders above your peers and have shown enough interest to get off your ass and learn more about your chosen profession. 

If your employers (like this one) doesn't respect that, move on to the next one. 

It's unprofessional of Employers to bitch about paying people a decent wage and then complain there's no one they can hire who's willing to work for a pittance. It's very hypocritical. 




 How can she honestly defend the stupid fuck who is a recidivist offender who feels he is above the law. Over 100 demerits means the little shit broke the law often enough to know better. 

And I daresay his mother feeds the pricks sense of entitlement. All I can say is it's really better to shut the fuck up and look stupid, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt. 

Edit: I give it about a month before he's caught again (because the other tickets obviously didn't stop him) and the cops look up his record, find this shit and throw the book at every single little minor indiscretion they can find. And more power to them in this instance. 




 Agree. KitKat on S5 was 5-6hours SOT w/ 13hours total.
Lollipop (Fresh install) is 3-4hours SOT with 13 hours total.
(And that's with ALL Samsung and MOST of the Google (Books/Movies etc Disabled) 




 Fully understand, I was just pulling those figures from the websites I found, but yeah you can live with others, or even a partner. :) 




 Shit, fucked that up. Sorry I'll fix it. Thanks, still negative, but not by so much. And in the past week, dunedin has been sitting on a high of 8degC. 

Perhaps not to bad over summer, but it will probably average around 40-50pw year round. (And this is all presuming you're flatting by yourself) It may be cheaper/more expendy depending on your habits, but again that's without insurance, cellphone, landline or internet bills.. 




 This coming from the softcock (who will ~~probably~~ hopefully read this.) who [blamed NZ internet](http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/games/68677940/game-developer-dean-hall-says-new-zealand-broadband-in-the-dark-age) on the inability to run a company in NZ. It's like seriously? You think you're the ONLY NZ company to have this same problem, so you go running to the media and actually **threatening** to take the work overseas. 

And now the cunt actually has the balls to try and hire immigrant anyway!?


He's just an outspoken asshole who's apparently looking to bag NZ in any way shape or form he can!?

**You can't refuse to pay market rates to our budding game developers, and then complain there are no game developers. You fucking hypocritical douche bag.**

Dude, GROW THE FUCK UP. Stop running to the media with your problems, if you have a problem with NZ stop being an asshole, blaming everything you can and threatening to take the jobs overseas. Honestly we're better off without you.

* [For the record with a student loan](http://www.salaries.co.nz/a/salary-tax-calculator/) $35,000 is $27,437 pa cash in hand.
* [Average Rent in Dunedin](http://www.enz.org/house-rents-dunedin.html) 350pw is 18,200 pa.
* Weekly grocery shop (Roughly): 100pw is 5200 pa.
* Weekly power (This is Dunedin, so this is an underestimate!): 50pw 2600 pa.
* Weekly petrol in a very cheap car: 35pw is 1820 pa.

**And you get $-383.. Without insurance, internet, landline or cellphone bills**


 So either that's not a 'living wage' or you will at the least be barely scraping the barrel to survive off that salary! That's not a reasonable wage for someone (who's doing skilled work even breaking into the industry), and it's hardly surprising that he's not able to get any staff! 









 It's simple. Work for the highest hourly wage ever.

Step 1. Get a fine.

Step 2. Repeat step 1.

Step 3. Go to court for unpaid fines.

Step 4. Get community service in exchange for fines.

Step 5. ???

PROFIT!!!!!!

Seriously, I know people who have worked for THOUSANDS of dollars AN HOUR wiped off their fines.

It's a fucking joke. 









 For the record: [from the article] "Currently, about a third of all CEFC investments involve small-scale solar. The corporation, which has produced more than a $1 profit for the government for every $1 invested, was assessing $500 million in finance for solar projects valued at more than $1 billion.
There are 1.3 million rooftop solar systems in Australia and most households receive publicly-backed rebates to install, but the CEFC has made a priority projects that help people who do not own their own homes, those who live in apartments and community groups to invest in solar"

So in short they helped mum and dad install a solar panel or two in order to help with the energy bill. Not any longer. 

What the actual fuck? How can they justify this?!  














 And can I say: what a fucking fool. [Wind Energy is one of the cheapest forms of renewable energy. And for a country with ailing mining industry you would have thought they would be embracing other forms of energy!?](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/13/wind-power-is-cheapest-energy-unpublished-eu-analysis-finds) 









 I fully understand! There are kiwis (Asian, European, Maori) who are all in the same barrel. However it's specifically overseas cashed up buyers, for whom money is no object and they want a safe haven/some way to basically get cash out of the country. 

You have to wonder how though, they're actually very restricted as to how much cash cash flow out of China, look it up. So if they're cash sales there's likely something dodgy going on.

But it's not just China, with our houses literally up for ANY nationality to buy then anyone who's got the bare minimum is always going to be up against tough competition.  




 Argh, my son is fucked in terms of buying a house. As my mate lamented the other day, even a couple on over a 100,000 pa income struggle to save enough to buy, then service a home loan. It's pathetic, we're literally prisoners in our own economy. I don't give a flying fuck if those old fucks are making mega dollars on their 2000 they bought back in 1967 cause realistically that doesn't go into the fucking economy, it goes back to some private property investor fat cat who currently doesn't pay tax on that income. So tell me more how it benefits me (a 28yo male)? It doesn't! 

Fuck the foreign buyers, especially fuck the banks for being greedy cunts, causing the property crisis by loaning money to people who couldn't pay it back (you know the middle class who haven't had a pay rise in years, while ceo's and other fat cats line their pockets with the proceeds of the effort of these people but I digress), then further fucking over the middle class by allowing foreign buyers preference over first home buyers with their LVR restrictions, and I'm just waiting till the government blames first home buyers on the prices flying upwards, just wait it will happen! It already has over in Australia!

Edit: If you're going to downvote me, tell me how I've got it wrong? What do you not like about my comment? Don't just anonymously disrespect my opinion without at least telling me why.

Edit: And more downvotes without saying why. Of course my elders who own houses are thoroughly enjoying this, their house prices are inevitably increased which is good for them, however they either don't care, or are blind to the problems facing **their** sons and daughters.  




 So.. if Gerry had openly refuted the claims, had the dinner in an open and honest manner declaring everything along the way with nothing to hide I wouldn't have had a problem, neither would have anyone else. 

It was only 1 guy complaining from presumably quite a large list of people he invited.

The ultimate question is did he really have to cancel an entire sponsored dinner (probably at great cost to the booking fee etc) over 1 sour man accusing him of being cohorts with the company who won the contract over him? 

Or did the guy make him realise it actually maybe wasn't a good look, and could appear as a conflict of interest, so cancelled it, while blaming the guy as a scapegoat? 

I'm leaning towards the latter, judging by his outburst flying off at the guy about it. 




 Well, that's exactly my argument. 

For instance in the IT world you never just go with the biggest company, as smaller companies can sometimes respond to your needs faster and be more open to ideas!
 




 Sorry, I should explain! They charged the restocking fee on a mate who bought from them, a Maximum VII Hero, and a Samsung M.2 SSD. the Maximus doesn't accept SATA M.2's (not that you could tell from the specs!) and so he had to return it, and they demanded a 35% cut of a $300 dollar item, and he swapped it out with a SATA SSD.

He should have argued it, as really he bought every other component from them as he told the retailer his purpose (by having every single component for a PC in his cart) that he was building a PC and that the HDD he had selected was not compatible with that motherboard. Therefore the item was not fit for purpose.

It's a bit of a gray area, but I reckon he should have argued they didn't warn him when boxing the components, or even have it explicitly state that while the motherboard has an M.2 slot it does not accept SATA based M.2 drives, only PCIe based M.2 drives. (Confused yet?)

However he didn't argue and just took the $100 whack to his wallet! 




 It's not corruption, as /u/nightform has informed me, they are one of the biggest companies, and the market is geared towards security in size. So it's like a snowball effect. They are just so big they collect the contracts, as there are very little competition/none at that level. 




 They don't *just* switch parts, they take a hefty fucking 35% cut as a "restocking fee". 




 I fully understand, and you make complete sense.  









 I found [this from 2009 which doesn't mention offices.](http://transportblog.co.nz/2009/08/24/minimum-parking-requirements/)

And [this from 2015 from indicate there are NO parks required in Chch at all ""It's hard to understand why I am not required one car park but by law I am required to put 38 bicycle parks in my building," he said" which is from one of the main men behind the Chch rebuild](http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/67535988/Car-park-shortage-could-stall-Christchurch-development)

If that is the case then it against confirms the council are bunch of arsehole ignoramuses. 




 I see what you're saying, but to a layman you're setting yourselves up to fail when you continually award every single large project to the same company.

No company is beyond corruption as the Public found out about [Projenz](https://www.sfo.govt.nz/n494,27.html) not so gracefully last year. And no company is too big to fail either, which would leave Chch people extremely in the lurch as most of the work going on is with the same company. That to me just doesn't make sense.

I have however seen some things in the past few months that have really opened my eyes into how contracts are awarded and Gerry's response to something he must be accused of on a weekly basis just doesn't pass muster. 




 I understand what you're saying, they are one of (if not) the biggest construction company in NZ. 
However (to me anyway) the whole point of tender is to ensure the work is done by the ~~best~~cheapest not whoever's the biggest. 

Just saying they got it because they have no competition is a bit silly as you're kinda resigning the industry to ensuring they're their own worst enemy by continually giving work to one company on the basis of well they are the biggest.. 

However above all he's a Politician for goodness sake, and grown man who should be able to stick by his decisions.

Furthermore, had he not cancelled it, this more than likely would have been a non-event. However, by cancelling the event, after having invited journalists he knew very well (or his PR team should have told him..) that this was going to get more scrutiny than warranted.

The accusations being thrown at him by someone who lost an extremely lucrative contract so of course they are going to be pissed about it, and say stupid things. However he really didn't need to respond like this. 




 Exactly. If everything stacked up to scrutiny, why would he throws his toys from the cot like a petulant child? Not the actions of an innocent man. 




 You know how to look guilty as sin? Act like a twat when someone accuses you of doing something that looks like favouritism.

"He labelled the insinuation "unacceptable" and cancelled the drinks."

No improper relationship there ay?

Let's look at what Fletchers have been awarded..

* [$300M Anchor project](http://www.fletcherconstruction.co.nz/news.php?
action=viewnews id=444)
* [$800 million East and North Frame residential precinct](http://collaboratecanterbury.org.nz/news/fletcher-residential-awarded-east-and-north-frame/)
* [EQR Contract (worth probably billions)](http://www.eqr.co.nz/qa)

And then you have the other work they've been awarded..

* [Fletchers awarded $260M Canterbury university work (as part of the Government support package, so I wonder who really awarded them this?)](https://www.nzx.com/companies/UOC/announcements/262127)

Fletchers OWN Canterbury construction work and you really wonder why people are pissed off? 
 









 Exactly. I appreciate 99% of houses down south, even on the shores of lake Tekapo etc are still weatherboard on piles and can get very very very very cold. 




 Yes, you're right, but it's not much the lack of support from the businesses, bear in mind 99% of them don't own the land, rather lease it. And those who lease it only buy what's available.

This needs to be addressed with a building code change - for X amount of people the building can hold, Y% must be available for parking.

However as I've pointed out before, what sounds better? 

"For Sale $1M Office building fits 500 staff, 300 car parks."
"For Sale $1.3M Office building fits 900 staff."

The latter of course, therefore in order to get as much profit from their developments they don't want a minimum carpark allowance, therefore as developers are well and truely one of the biggest campaign boosters this will not happen.

So long story short, council is being an ass. Developers force the problem to the council. And the little guy loses. Once again. 




 Not really, it's the developers who are allowed to make maximum profit by having increased desk space without the need to include car parking in their plans. I mean being able to create a brand new office that fits 200 staff, but only creating enough parks for 10% of those staff only move the problem on to the streets. 




 Or council and government have cemented our dependence upon cars when they constantly reject light rail.  




 It's a very one sided argument. 

You can't say you're punishing someone unfairly without saying why they're being punished to begin with. 




 It's 2 weeks of footage wrapped up into a neat 43 minute package designed for an hour of tv. 

We see what the producer wants us to see. They clearly think drama and bullying sells. 

The truly disappointing thing is from the synopsis  It's a great idea, just really frustrating they're trivializing the struggle depicted by the many colourful people who they meet by leaving so much of it on the cutting floor to make way for this bullshit 

It's really disappointing.  




 The popularity of crowdfunding things like this is stupid people will forego insurance thinking they can just pull the same trick, but it doesn't work like that.. 




 There's no mention of what he was actually put away for.. 




 Amazon give away a couple hundred dollars worth of apps every other month. So yes, they do pay you. 









 Yes... At the moment Chch's nights around -2 - +3 degC. 
Our days are around 7-15degC. Most houses are single glazed, wooden structures on piles, so the wind just whips any heat away almost instantly. 



















 Yay! That's excellent. Also: "Smoke alarms would be compulsory from July." how are they NOT compulsory already!? Oh well another win for the little guy anyway! 









 I would agree with you if Samsung weren't a pack of fuckwits who love crippling their old hardware by refusing to update the software suite. For instance, shit like Themes, or Camera2 api support should have been released for the s5, but Samsung, being the pile of cunts they are have chosen to deliberately save those for the newer devices, despite stuff like themes being device agnostic. 




 It's a real pity, cause there was a guy down Lincoln/Moorhouse who was just doing it to supplement the DPB. 

But then you get the fucks who steal the Servo's washers and just cold water and a bucket. 

Well they've gone and ruined it for themselves. Little arrogant fucktards. 









 I know the corner, pretty mint.  




 Very muchly, I agree WLG were gimped from the start, but having spent a week there recently they aren't doing too badly with what they've got.

On the other hand, getting from Riccarton Avenue for instance to the carpark beside the bus Exchange, you have to go through about 5 set of lights, and cross at least 3 lanes of traffic (at a time.) which is nearly impossible for someone who doesn't 100% know where they're going. Which is stupid, road's should be intuititive and easy to use.  




 Are we talking about the same Country? [TVNZ reported Nearly 250,000 drivers were stung over December and January for driving at speeds up to the usual tolerance of 10kmh over the limit. Resulting in 7.3M$ taken](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/lower-tolerance-nets-4650-increase-in-speeding-fines-6303942.html) 




 Thank you! Exactly. They can't just tout a lower reduced tolerance as a crash reduction parameter, while it may be a factor, it's one of many in regards to whether people crash. 

I get it, speeding past a school = dangerous.
Speeding (~110) on the open road when in a passing lane = acceptable behaviour

However while they do they do the occasional blitz outside schools, I've personally only seen a speed camera van down fendalton road on a monthly basis. Never once have I seen a police presence outside Burnside highschool, despite the fact I drive past daily when parents are dropping their kids off.
 




 Indeed! It's hell with "No turn" signs everywhere. The 1 way system works for pedestrians, not so much for cars. 




 So people can's just slam on the brakes past the speed cameras. That's quite a good idea (from a scientific point of view.)

Does it work though? 




 "try to limit the amount of intersections" No one told that to Chch city builders...... 




 True. I have too little faith in the greed of those of those who control the cameras that that they will be able to resist the extra potential income forever. 




 I'll try it out! 

I traditionally have attempted to use screencast to get some videos to play, but most detect you're using an "HDMI out" and refuse to play, citing HDCP protection. 




 I agree, but cars and drivers don't/can't just slam on the brakes to go the posted sign limit if the system thinks that now's a good time to change it to 60. 

I can only hope there will be a buffer zone - e.g. the system waits a second before pinging people for speed, as people who go past it right as it changes from 60-40 but have no hope of physically seeing the sign change.

I know it's a rare situation, but there's a lot of potential for abuse from the operators to change the speed and ping people immediately. 




 Fair. Sorry Reddit. 









 OP, you have a lot of grease on your cellphone screen, this is causing your piss poor photo. Give it a wipe with a soft glasses lens cloth. 




 I wouldn't mind if it snowed, or rained. Fuck this ice shit.
