 What I mean is a prequel focusing on Shrek's life before Shrek 1 and a prequel on Donkey's life before Shrek 1 etc. If Puss in Boots was successful, then these could do just as well in my opinion. I especially would pay to see a Donkey movie!  









 u are not wrong 














 anyone hear the Spider-Man reference? 




 this is perfect casting!!  




 I had no "hopes" for this film. I just saw it was critically praised and me and my friend watched it for something fun to do (+ i wanted to see what all the fuss was about). And imo it was disappointing. 

and sorry "they're supposed to be dumb" thats just idiotic to me.  




 wow. typical redditor. this isn't a plea for attention at all, i just didn't like the film. sick of assholes like yourself assuming that just cus im against popular opinion that im automatically wrong. no. i didnt like it. end of story. no plea.  




 glad im not alone 




 completely agree about the soundtrack! 




 1. I thought the soundtrack was cool but very misused. WHY they played it during the silent driving scenes where there's no tension or fear building up i will never know.
2. The main girl was such a dumb character. On the beach, she should have been constantly looking around for "it" rather than just look out to sea, then she gets hit by it. So dumb!
3. There was no tension.
4. It wasnt scary. 
5. The ending was dogshit. 

anyway, thats just my opinion. (let the hate begin) 




 agreed 














 fake 









 as insignificant as it is, i loved that they kept in the guy saying "fuck you asshole!" i thought they were going to remove it cus of the pg-13 rating but no. when he said it it made me smile :) 




 Im in the UK also

Tomorrowland was called "Tomorrowland: A World Beyond"
The Adventures of Tintin was given the subtitle "The Secret of the Unicorn"
Neighbors was called "Bad Neighbours"

thats all i can think of but i know theres more
