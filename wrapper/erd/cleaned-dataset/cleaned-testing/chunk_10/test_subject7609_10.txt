 I like Harry Crews, William Gay, Larry Brown, Donald Ray Pollock, Flannery O'Connor, Faulkner, McCarthy, McCullers, and a few more.  









 Please stop using "the feels", it makes you sound like an idiot 




 I read SK's The Stand straight after and I think it's so much better

This is making my eye twitch

 




 Strongly disagree. 




 Brooks is saying that Coates negative view of American history is wrong (point #2, ""I think you distort American history"), and that even if he is actually right, stop to stop his complaining (point #4). Then he has the gall (point #6) to claim that Coates' writing is actually hurting the country/American dream.

Brooks isn't wrong per say, just missing the point, and straw-manning. Brooks did not need to point out the obvious fact that "White America's not all bad!" It's hardly a review - it's just smug condescension from his ivory tower.

 




 Hated Jim Gaffigan's book *Dad is Fat* 




 he's a tone deaf asshole who is handwaving away racial complaints from his yacht 




 because he's playing the upper middle class white man victim card in response to meaningful racial criticism 




 I really hate this article, but it's controversial and in the news, so posted for discussion

 interesting take on american psycho [here:](https://italkyoubored.wordpress.com/2011/10/20/american-psycho-maybe-not-the-book-you-think-it-is/)

A two decade old novel might seem appropriate now, of haves in glass towers and have nots protesting in the streets, a book which is supposedly either a literal story of an investment banker who is a serial killer, or an investment banker who only imagines that he kills a series of men and women, his murder spree a metaphor for his professions indifference to larger society and the damage he does to it. Curious about whether this book would shed light on the turmoil now, I found a third theme  the book is a cryptomorph, its subject neither mass murder, or a metaphor for the financial world, but about being gay and closeted during the first years of the AIDS outbreak. This is not a case of a symbolic undercurrent; almost all the male characters, including Patrick Bateman and Timothy Price are gay closeted men, with that aspect of their lives, off-stage and unspoken directly of, but most certainly there. (cont.) 














 Are you a child to not understand people's differing reactions to sexual vs non sexual violence?  




 Harry Crews is a master and virtually unknown. *Feast of Snakes* is a good place to start but everything I've read by him has been unreal.

If you like southern gothic - Larry Brown, William Gay, Flannery Oconnor, Faulkner, etc, you should give Crews a try, although he is very different from all in his own way.

Nice article on him from the millions: http://www.themillions.com/2012/04/harry-crews-and-the-death-of-southern-literature.html 




 Keep telling yourself that 




 You mean WotC and Hasbro's reaction to banning a guy that anally and vaginally raped a girl passed out over a toilet? 









 Give yourself a congratulatory pat on the back for your assumedly correct position on the book you've never read!  




 The article doesn't even mention the word rape besides in the tweet. Nice reporting! 




 I'm not arguing that, I think it's just a fact that this is a win-win situation for Cruz.

What I'm saying is that the NYT can't simply claim it has sources that show manipulation through bulk sales in the face of multiple other sources/newspapers contradicting that statement, and expect to come out of the situation unharmed (whether it be public opinion, integrity, litigation, etc) 




 I'm pretty sure the word is not solely reserved for legal matters...

If you're going to exclude a politically charged book on the basis of bulk sales without providing evidence, it's going to cause a media frenzy. Your publication gets some unfavorable opinions printed about it, Cruz gets to drive home the point that the liberal media has an unfair bias against him, and sales are driven for the book you took off your list for cheating in the first place.

 









 The onus is on the NYT to provide evidence of bulk sales used for manipulation, though. I don't doubt it happened, but you can't remove a book based on guesswork 




 Dirty Wars by Jeremy Scahill 




  nearly 400 pages of the author ejaculating nerd references onto the pages

Pretty much. This book is not for you. 



















 Never thought I'd side with Ted Cruz on anything. Am I in bizarro world 




 I'll agree with that. I read *Off Season* and while not bad, didn't come away too impressed. He fits the description of the thread though.  




 :) I think those books are all good to great (haven't read Haunted), just gets old seeing them every time the topic is brought up 




 I knew I would love *The Sellout* by Paul Beatty after reading the very first page. 




 These threads always have the same books - *House of Leaves*, *Haunted*, *American Psycho*, *Wasp Factory*...

For something fresh I'll recommend ***Angel Dust Apocalypse* by Jeremy Robert Johnson**

 









 Both are great. The movie leaves out the final chapter of the book, but otherwise I remember it following the book pretty faithfully. There are differing views about the inclusion of said last chapter, but I think the inclusion of it makes the story more complete. 




 **The Sellout by Paul Beatty**

So far, incredibly good 









 I'm not being nasty. Marginalizing other people's legitimate problems is very rude. As I said, there are plenty of places to discuss literature without gender/race politics being the centerpiece. I'd suggest posting in the 95% of other articles posted to the sub, rather than this particular article, if you'd really like to avoid it. 




 Her eyes widened, and she swiveled her head around to stare at me.

Sixth place? she repeated. In the world? No bullshit?

I crossed my heart, but did not hope to die.

That's some serious bill-paying skillage, she said. Color me impressed, Zack-Zack Lightman.

Color me flattered, Miss Larkin, I replied.

And there goes any chance of me reading this book. \*Tips fedora* 




 Seriously? No one is making you read the article. There's the entire remainder of the front page you can gladly peruse rather than this one. But why easily skip over something than butt in and proudly proclaim, "This issue does not affect me and should thusly be unimportant to all!" 









 I'm looking for help in upgrading this machine I ordered pre-built a year ago. I've built a machine before, but ordered this prebuilt because I had very little time to do the research/work. I mostly play indie and 4x games that aren't too graphically intensive, but I'm looking to upgrade for Fallout 4 (and Witcher 3 probably while I'm at it).

Looking to drop maybe a few hundred on what's likely a new graphics card, unless you build gurus feel otherwise. Can probably wait until November to do this if there's something to wait for. Apologies if this is the wrong place. I appreciate the help.

 Jesse Ball's *A Cure for Suicide*, he has been consistently great. Also interested in *Eileen* by Ottessa Moshfegh  




 Mcglue was great, looking forward to reading her next one 









 Wear your chastity belt just in case 




 It's a business decision on the part of WotC. I don't have much sympathy for rapists so it isn't one I particularly care about either 




 still a rapist... 




 Good riddance 




 Generally anything published by nyrb classics 




 he's a rapist 




 Hey dude if you love rapists and chilling with them that's your prerogative 




 this is real life where actions have consequences that often reach beyond arbitrary laws. Some actions have lifelong effects like it or not 




 banning someone from a cardgame is not vigilante justice 




 because that's the consequences of being a rapist 




 banning someone from a card game is not an offense 




 his apology is incredibly phony, 3 months is not enough time to serve let alone rehabilitate for rape. He is a rich white boy who got off the hook easy because of his rich mommy and daddy

and anyone that frequently uses "white knighting" is probably a pretty bad human to begin with, to get back to my original point 




 you are just arguing semantics now, goodbye 




 i'm personally ok with grouping all rapists i've never met into the bucket of "bad person" 




 but the rapist's heartfelt apology was totally legit? 




 as opposed to your presumable stance, the line not being drawn there? 




 if you rape someone you're a sociopath and a you'd be a clown to believe anything he says 




 well he posted a heartfelt apology here so he must be a great guy 




 because being drunk and 19 is not a rape excuse. who cares about the tweet 




 how long did it take to come up with that clever reply 




 you're an awful human being 




 This sub hates Drew Levin more than the guy who actually fucking raped somebody 




 last i checked he didn't rape anyone so no 




  Whatever his criminal history may or may not be, banning a player for it sets a pretty insane precedent. Do they start doing background checks on DCI registration? Facebook creeping players now? Disallow players with a DUI so they aren't tempted to drive to FNM?

How about we just start with drawing the line at violent sexual assault 




 This sub is fucking insane 




 raping someone is definitely comparable to disallowing someone to play a card game. thumbs up 




 Couldn't have happened to a nicer rapist 



















 Also, the inspiration and hope that it lends to people is very real.

So is the strife, hatred and death it's usage has caused

 




 The readers' list has 4 Ayn Rand and 3 L. Ron Hubbard in the top *ten*. Yikes... 




 **The Invention of Morel, by Adolfo Bioy Casares** 




 Gene Wolfe uses this technique a lot, Severian from *The Book of the New Sun* is the one I always think of 









 Marion Zimmer Bradley molested her own daughter from the ages of 3 - 12 














 *The Demolished Man* is great as well 




 The book is alright I guess. Chuckled here and there, didn't feel too strongly either way about it. You're correct in that it's pretty much a poor man's Vonnegut. It has the absurdist humor, but is kind of lacking the trademark Vonnegut worldview/philosophy.  Haven't seen the movie.  









 *Bird Box* by Josh Malerman is a great suspenseful horror novel, not really too gory.  




 You could try reading horror that doesn't have supernatural elements, like *The Girl Next Door* or *We Have Always Lived In The Castle* 




 The sub is dead and has zero discussion. 




 I've only read three books published in 2015 this year, and I've only liked one of them, *Haints Stay* by Colin Winnette. I really enjoyed it, but I don't think it will be my favorite of the year come January. That said, if you are looking for a nice western with spare prose that mixes violence and beauty you will enjoy it. 




 It's a booklist, so I linked it here - http://flavorwire.com/524728/the-15-best-fiction-books-of-2015-so-far/view-all

Do you agree with the list? What have you read that was published this year that has been your favorite?

 




 Richard Yates is famous for Revolutionary Road due to the movie but almost no one has read The Easter Parade, which is his best novel 









 It's a deceptively simple sentence that does an incredible amount. It establishes a grim setting and tone, and invokes curiosity in the reader (what event has happened that caused them to sleep in a gym?). I'm no English major, but I think it's a great opener. 




 I am reading *Haints Stay* right now. So good! 




 I can't believe "________________" isn't on the list 









 I'm very serious 




 Yes, ebooks exist, but you could alternatively just ask them while you're on a date if they like to read. If they said no, it would be a huge deal breaker for me. 




 And? Are you going to choose the first woman you see on the street to be your wife because you don't want to judge? 




 I read things out of my comfort zone all of the time, but they don't look boring to me. 

The only time I'll read books that look boring to me is if they're my book club's selection. Sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised, and sometimes they're boring 




 It isn't a criteria for liking/disliking someone, it's his/her criteria for picking a partner - two very different things.  









 There's a stigma against reading in this sub too. Put a nickel in a jar every time you see the word "pretentious" here,  and treat yourself to a nice dinner at the end of every week 









 Lol, 500 upvotes for a guy acting like a huge asshole. Great sub 
























 Yeah he got a big head and tried to take on an impossible challenge while being pretty green to directing. Still don't see why that makes him hatable rather than more admirable. I'll gladly take a failed movie from a director with heart that tries to be experimental than the latest regurgitated formulaic hollywood anyday 




 I don't get the Franco hate on this sub, as the guy is a huge bookworm 




 *The Secret History* by Donna Tartt  




 Lots of good ones listed. Off the top of my head add ts elliot and ee cummings 




  some are okay with that. I'm not.

I'm not going to read Fifty Shades either, but why do you care? 




 Since it is frequently mentioned in blurbs about your books and the show, to what extent was Twin Peaks/David Lynch an influence on your writing? 




 not being serious ;) 




 Actually, it's about ethics in the portrayl of the BDSM community 
























 Of course. I read too much to be able to afford to buy every book I want to read, and often don't really want to buy books I decide to just read on a whim 




 Here's my humble advice as a dad of a four and two year old:

Don't worry so much about *which* books to get. You will probably end up with a book overload from friends and family from gifts and hand me downs. My kids like books like *Where the Wild Things Are*, Mercer Meyer's *Little Critter* series, Dr. Seuss books, etc, but the books themselves aren't that important. (Edit: u/wjbc's list is great... very similar to what we read in our home)

Focus on making the books fun for your kids. Picture books are much better than reading them things for older kids like Harry Potter, as they can point things out, and you can ask them to find certain things ("Where's the frog on this page"). Interactivity is also pretty key - taking an imaginary apple from the page and eating it, doing wacky voices, dances to certain parts, stupid things like that.

Also, you'll be reading some of these books hundreds to thousands of times, so pick something you can have fun with as well.

Finally, most important piece of advice! Start reading the day your new baby comes home and do it every day! So important, develops vocabularly, letter and color recognition, and hopefully a lifelong love of learning. Good luck! 









 Neil Gaiman at the top of r/books? What's next, people praising Stephen King or *The Martian*? 




 Well, there's the Houston Foster-Watts 




 both incredible books. Never see anyone mention The Easter Parade, one of my all time favorites... 









 No, it's literally what you said 




 People say it's a vocal minority that ruins it for the rest but I never hear anything from rational feminists. They seem to be very quiet.

Translation: Every feminist is irrational. That's why you're getting jumped on 




 I don't think the point of the article was anger over spoiling new elements of the show. Rather, anger over the show just throwing setup and context out the window, and introducing new nonsensical, pointless, or badly written storylines that are counter to what made ASOIAF interesting and different in the first place.

One example: [Brienne just happening to show up in the woods at exactly the right time to deal the finishing blow to Stannis](#s) 




 Nothing. It's simply not that good 



















 Not 100 percent set on the high seas, but McGlue by Ottessa Moshfegh is a great short book, highly recommended
