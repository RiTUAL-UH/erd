Most perfect casting ever IMO. 




 Looks like a promo shot for the new Mad Max. 




  finder keepers and all that

Theft is another word for it. 




 Is she actually not wearing trousers for some random reason or is it an illusion? 




 Probably a Lady Gaga video. 




 Browsing r/new. 




 James Bond is hunting, hunted and alone.

So it's a James Bond film then. 




 Be humble. 




 No it isn't. It's just a "what if" story. 




 Didn't Pixar just release a film? Are they rushing these things out now? 




 Looks more like heart shaped black fur rather than the nose being heart shaped. 




 All of them. All the double standards. 




 I have no idea how to feel about this film, I have mixed feelings about the last few.

Casino Royale = Awesome
Quantum of Solcae = Pure shit
Skyfall = Fogettable
Spectre = ?

Also, James going off the grid, is he making a habit out of this or is it just me? 




 Did you not blend it? 




 How is that a whale? Also this is a very frequent repost. 




 No you can't get a calorie count, however, I can get one for you. 














 A rapper doesn't actually live the life he portrays in his videos and media? Wow.

This news brought to you by the university of no shit sherlock. 




 It might take a while. But we'll have all the karmas eventually. 




 Is your sister 12 or a homophobe? 




 And back to you! (We may be onto something here) 




 Thanks. Have one back :) 




 But that's a cool trick. Never heard of it until now.  




 I did it the legit way, as I've done with everything in that game.  




 Ho Lee Fuk.

Would love to show them an iPhone. 




 Do you mean the whale from the film or the whale used to portray the whale in the film? 









 I like they way Sepp was avoiding the money like he was scared of it.

"Oh noes. This money is not dirty. I can't let it touch me!" 




 I know. I was explaining to him why you get the RPG before the homing launcher in an attempt to quell his confusion.

Downvoted for clarifying my position. Ok then. 




 I like to fly low to the ground and close to buildings, you can't beat the situational awareness of 3rd person IMO. If you're in VTOL mode trying to nail enemies first person doesn't cut it unless they're far away. When in air to air combat I can always get a better view of my opponent looking around with the right stick in 3rd person than I do in 1st person. By definition the 1st person view limits your range of vision compared to 3rd.

At least that's how I see it. 




 I rarely did the free roam myself, it felt empty because there was nothing to do other than kill people. My online experience with 4 was mostly just races. I'm glad GTA Online was a huge improvement and I look forward to what they do with GTAVI :) 




 Struggling to think of a more pointless mod than this.

I got nothing. 




 That still would have been a wrong title since I'm pretty sure OP isn't the youtuber RedKeyMon. 




 You say that, but TBOGT added the best helicopter in the damn game, Yusuf's golden Buzzard! 




 You peasant, be gone from me! 




 There's literally dozens of videos on youtube showing you where to land every single stunt jump successfully. 




 Not me. I got my RPG months before the homing launcher wsa added to the game.

The weapons added by updates aren't level locked, that's why you get it before the RPG. 




 It's the hyrda, brought back from GTA San Andreas. 




 Is staged. It's a stunt. 




 I couldn't disagree more. I prefer flying in 3rd person because you can actually see what's below you, in a plane you can't do that in first person.

Edit: Changed can to can't, as was initially intended. 




 OP should get his facts right. This is [Red Keymon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm1F9GekuQVNf93XU7-i9kw), he does crazy stunts in GTA, and this was of course staged.

Source video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08F8hYlfDbc 




 Again? Oh no, wait. It's the same picture as before.  




 I doubt it will either. I doubt any will to be honest since I don't think they've done anything similar in the past. I'm still ok playing vanilla skyrim anyway, it's my favourite game.  




 He's not done yet I believe. Still, he won't look all that much like Red Skull. Maybe enough to resemble him.  




 Yeah they could. But I was just 18, they probably figured it wasn't worth it.  




 [I keep hearing the FUCKING NUMBERS!](http://i.imgur.com/vncZ8J3.gif) 




 I thought she meant illegal aliens until she mentioned the anal probing. That cleared things right up. 




 Either she's trolling or she's mentally disturbed. I hope she's seeing a psychiatrist either way.

 The market for large swine ejaculate is LUCRATIVE.

I... I would imagine... 




 Back in 2003 I was working at McDonalds. When my friend came in I always gave him a little more than he asked for with his order. It escalated to the point where he would ask for a big mac meal and walk out with about 4 burgers, a load of nuggets, couple of drinks, and an apple pie or two.

Needless to say I was stupid but my manager wasn't. 




 I'm curious. At what point did you not see everyone losing their minds when he insinuated that immigrants are rapists and such? It was all over the web, and now here I an on a Monday morning hearing about him badmouthing a senator for the first time. 




 Wow. This really helps the bad image atheists have in America. I mean, this couldn't possibly make people think less of atheists, right?

How is this not just straight-up Christian propaganda?

I couldn't give a shit if someone wanted to pray before eating their meal in a restaurant. 




 [Yup](http://media.giphy.com/media/TWhOmZ783UrwA/giphy.gif) 




 If I didn't know I was in Italy until I found some Coke I'd be worried. 




 Anyone who doesn't say "YOLO", "SWAG", or "dank".

I would accept swag or dank if used with the correct meaning, not the new meanings kids have given them. 




 Breathe, usually. 




 "No, it's easy. Look! I made a [pidgeonrat](http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l2zm1z7mzN1qc073co1_400.gif)!" 




 This is the best synchronised gif I've seen since [this](http://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/a8jpQDQ_460sv.mp4) 




 The title kind of diminishes the role of all mothers around the world who didn't give birth in a car.

"Thats the reminder that the birth is very natural thing"

And many women who give birth "in the wild" like this tend to suffer more complications than those in hospital. There's a reason people try to get to a hospital when they're giving birth.  




 I know, and the point I'm making is that I hated everything about Morrowind. I could only muster 5 hours before giving up because of the terrible mechanics, Oblivion was my first you see.

But I see their point too. Now I know Morroblivion is supposedly finished I'm totally going to give that a go because so many people claim Morrowind is the best one, and this is the only way I'd be able to tolerate playing it again. 




 I'm 30 with no kids.

Let's do this? 




 Until they remastered Skyrim or Oblivion. 




 I tried to play Morrowind after staring my ES adventures with Oblivion, but 5 hours in I hated literally everything about it. I'd love to play it through the eyes of Oblivion. It would give me a chance to enjoy the land and story without the mechanics I hated so much. 




 And so CDs die and everyone moves exclusively to digital downloads for their music.  




 That is the most context specific gif I've ever seen. It's.. it's glorious! 









 There's a big difference between doing something normal like driving a car or flying a plane which in many cases are necessary, and deliberately doing something very dangerous by choice when there's no need to.  




 Good point. I always forget about old Hyabusa.  




 He's been in every major release in the main series. 

I'm pretty sure he wasn't in Mortal Kombat Special Forces.  




 I like the way you felt like you had to clarify who Ryu was but not Slenderman or Spawn.  




 Another day, another person asking who we want to see as DLC. 

Seriously, can we rename this subreddit 
r/Whodoyouwantinfuturemortalkombatdlc already? 




 Man swimming in shark infested waters gets attacked by a shark.

Nothing unbelievable about it.  




 I've got no sympathy for people who swim in shark infested waters then get attacked by a shark. I feel the same way about those people as I do people who climb electrical towers and then get shocked.  




 The Grotti Turismo R, came as part of the business update back in the day. $500,000, one of the best cars IMO.  




 We built this city is an awesome tune! I'd stay if you played that.  




 I don't get it.  




 Ah I get it now. People played UMK3 in the arcades. Living in England (but not in a major city) the only time I ever got play an arcade machine as a kid was when the fair was in town. And even then, we were lucky to get MK1, and at 1 a go (which usually lasted no more than a couple of minutes) we didn't get to play on it all that much.

And so I keep forgetting about later MK games being released in the arcades.  




 No seriously, what colour is Pluto?  




 Ken Han is a deluded moron who spreads socially dangerous ideas and messages.  




 MK Trilogy was to UMK3 what UMK3 was to MK3. A better version with more characters.  




 I had it when I was around 13 I think on the PS1. Loved it. Had no one to play it with mind. But I'm pretty sure it had all the characters in the franchise up to that point. Including a playable Noob Saibot (my introduction to him), Rain's first appearance, and even various kostumes for some characters.

With Kano you could play as the MK1 or MK3 versions. Kung Lao MK2 or 3, Raiden (or Rayden back then) as MK1 or MK2 and some others too. The old versions were updated with kombos and shit.

MK Trilogy was to UMK3 what UMK3 was to MK3, simply a better version with more characters. This is why I'm always confused when people express love for UMK3 like it's the best version of the klassic MK games.  




 Nope. I just always loved the concept of freezing your opponent in place, loved it in the first game and never really branched out since.  




 I've heard of it. Being English I've never seen it and know nothin of it. 

And don't call me Shirley.  




 Why do people keep hailing UMK3 as the superior classic MK when MK Trilogy was a thing? It introduces brutalities (unless I'm mistaken) and you could play as fucking GORO, KINTARO, MOTARO, AND SHAO KHAN!

 




 When I was a kid me and my friends were convinced Cyrax was Scorpion because of him being yellow and the net was too similar to the spear.

We didn't a have access to lore and shit back then.  




 I liked Mk3, got it for my 11th (I think) birthday. By your logic UMK3 sucked, that's why the MK Trilogy exists.  




 It's not uncommon MK knowledge.  




 Sub-Zero has been my boy since Mortal Kombat 1. Always my go to guy. The day I realised he was the only character to be in all of them was almost as awesome as the time I found out Noob Saibot (easily my second fave) was the original Sub-Zero.

He's just the man.  




 Heard the name before, no idea who this woman is.  




 Genius. I love it. 




 Trouble's a brewing. 




 That was all fun and games, until I saw Ryan Dunn :'( I forgot how much I used to watch these guys in my teenage years and how seeing them again is almost like being with old friends once more.

I'm gonna call my Mum and tell her I love her. 




 MORE Liu Kang, Sub Zero, and King Lao costumes? They've got enough IMO. NRS should give some kostumes to the new characters and the dlc folks. Pay for a dlc character and get one kostume? Wtf?

Also klassic Raiden is already in the game. It's his MK1 outfit, can't get more klassic than that.  




 They did the MK1 classics in the last game. This game brought back the UMK3/MK Trilogy classics and I love it. I always choose sub zeros player 2 klassic skin because that's the colour he was in UMK3. The player 1 klassic skin has his darker MK4 colour for some reason.  




 Mk3 classics? Wat? 




 Great video. Glad you made it.  




 We just have to find a colour blind mushroom eater.  




 Nope. Just a case of "Isn't everyone sick of being asked this question yet? It's been answered at least 5 times at this point." 




 It's always my go to example of how something totally shit and mundane can be considered art and sell for loads of money. I thought art was supposed to take skill and talent. Anyone can roll out of bed and say "Welp, think I'll sell this bed and buy a new house." 









 Let me guess. American, right? 




 I love the way the firefighter took a couple of seconds to size up the guy and the situation before taking the guy down. 




 Noes Geralt not go around butchering people and cutting their heads off and such? 




 Yeah, so? Isn't that what they had to do to get Jason and Predator? 




 Didn't know that. But still, it's possible they could acquire the rights isn't it? 




 True, Jason is slow. Good point. 




 You prefer the bed piece? It's an unmade bed! If that is art then literally anything can be. Can't believe someone paid 150,000 for something they could easily have made at home, or unmade. 




 So it's official. We now have a cool new art style to appreciate.

Better than that modern bullshit.

["Oh wow, an unmade bed, pay me 150,000 for my art!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Bed) 




 I don't know. He's slow (have you seen him run?), he's not known for gore, in fact most of the people he kills don't show gore.

I'm not saying he isn't cool, I'm just saying I don't think he's a good fit for the MK universe. 




 And now dambladge is how I'm going to say that word lol.

I was disappointed to find out that Reptile's slide doesn't go under projectiles. Sub-Zero has always been my main you see, and I'm used to being able to close distance when the enemy uses projectiles.

Just googled Reptil buffs and found this comment:

"Lol, I just checked the notes. He got NERFED if anything. Nerf to his nimble combos due to 4 having lower damage, buff to his absolutely pointless strings that no one uses. The only buff that matters is overhead doing 2 more damage but that doesn't affect him a lot exactly. Wow."

Can you confirm? 




 The only one I truly want :( 




 Don't know why you've been downvoted. That's actually not a bad idea.  




 And Starkiller. He was fun to use.  




 He's in Soul Calibur IV and would feel reeeeeally out of place in the MK universe. Predator, Jason, and Freddie felt ok because those films are known for their graphic violence and numerous fatalities. At least that's how I see it.  




 Nope. He wants characters that he enjoyed I. MK9 to be in this new game with its fancy new mechanics and features.  




 Sektoke.

Smytor.

You see where I'm going with this. 




 Another day, another person asking this question. Don't we all know which characters are wanted by this point? 




 I really wanted to enjoy using Reptile once they added the klassic skin, but he just feels underpowered compared to most others. Conglaturation on getting this trophy with Reptile! 




 It blows my mind how many people online can whoop my ass and yet I got that trophy on April the 22nd, three days after I got the game. 




 I can't quite believe I just spent 45 minutes watching someone fail to drill a lock off a door.  




 I came here because I almost saw my name in the title. 




 Is this the Kevin Smith/Andy McElfresh film? I thought about this just yesterday (after hearing th podcast many moons ago) and thought "I wonder if that film is still happening." 




 The way that kid backed off in fear. Looks like he's been on the wrong end of that guy before. 




 Take the ski mask off, that really sets them off.  




 The old speeding up to pass people on the street so you don't accidentally somehow make them think they're about to meet their doom. 

I know it well.  




 That music was just the same 5 seconds looped over and over for 4 minutes.

And the lead guitarist didn't look at the crowd. Not fucking once. He just kept shifting from one back-facing-the-crowd position to another.  




 I just finished watching that video. Great job here mate.  




 I just finished watching Man of Steel again for the time since release. 

This trailer makes me laugh at this film.  




 Who? Where? What?

Is this available now? 




 It's all relative. But you mentioned the 70's, not the 90's. 




 That's how I spend my money.  




 Rich people lead expensive lives. You get his with a cm few bad court cases and bam! No longer got the money for that expensive lifestyle.  




 That's what I thought. Thanks for clarifying.  




 You're no fun. 




 It says on tag in he gets "+100% basic damage".

Does this include the damage of his specials? 




 How dare you not take this seriously and actually try to make us laugh?

Get out! 




 So basically all the bad things on the internet should represent the internet and leave all the good stuff off?

Apart from boobs of course. Who doesn't love boobs? 




 My submission: http://www.randompicturesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Welcome-to-the-internet...-here-it-is-in-one-photo-600x480.jpg 

Better? 




 [You mean like this, only in flag form?](http://i.imgur.com/9IvVY7e.jpg) 




 I would also have accepted "many giant strips of bacon". 




 A genuinely great submission. I think this could actually be the flag of the internet, if such a thing was required. No jokes, just truth. 




 Lol. Maybe you should submit one with enough Dickbutt in it. I feel under qualified to determine how much Dickbutt is enough Dickbutt. 









 I greatly enjoyed Sandstorm and Never Gonna Give You Up before the internet ruined them. 




  but I remember a time **not so long ago** that public displays of homophobic violence were frequently seen in the US. **Leading up to** American psychology dropping homosexuality as a mental illness in **the 1970's**[1] there were frequent acts of violence

 




 You don't "get" clickbait, you make it. 




 ITT: Way too many uses of the term "a women". 




 Finally. Someone put it into terms I can use to explain this to people.  




 Looks just like Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars on PS3.

Always loved the name of that game.  




 Well done.  




 SUCK-AAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! 




 Every single "person" there that's not on fire is a reprehensible cunt that should be shot dead IMO.  




 They'd probably just put in the story character like Sindel, Baraka, Kabal, and Rain as they seem to be the most requested of the story characters. I can't see them soon smoke since he's a faction kill.

I don't care about those though, Noob is life.  




 I feel so redundant knowing that a creature with a relatively simple mind, no arms, and no legs can climb a tree without the aid of branches.  




 This makes me happy.  




 At first I thought the flagpole was in the back of his truck.

I was wondering how his freedom was going to fit under bridges. 

Edit: Added two words for grammar.  




 I like Bryan Cranston and all, but that was a bit of a dick response to a genuine question.  




 You didn't shorten it, you told a completely different story. This video doesn't explain the COD story, it explains the COD zombies story.  




 Yeah, iOS user here. Oh well.  




 Maybe when you're being entertained ed you consider it wanted time, but not me. Time spent having fun is time spent well in my opinion. But thanks for your insightful comment.  




 You can explain it quicker I'm sure. But this is obviously a very in depth look at it.  




 It's probably more in depth.  




 The game fails to load the cloud save for me after hanging on a black screen for ages. I then can choose to load the device save. But when I try a battle it hangs while looking for allies. Are their servers messed up or something? Anyone else having this issue? 




 I'm not blowing my precious koins on the chance to get that. I want it. But no doubt I'd be paying 70,000 to get cards I've already got, about 5 times. There's already so much I need to spend the koins on, like support cards, and trying to save up to promote Raiden and Liu Kang.  




 Just saw a video of a guy opening the pack and the cards DO NOT show up in the store after spending 850 souls you need to spends 850 souls every time you want to fuse them. Screw that. Looks like I'm not getting the new characters.  




 This post needs to be the top comment.  




 Ah nice always taken it as "No way am I reading all that text. Fuck it." 




 I doubt most people will watch it all in one sitting lol.  




 Or it was just that the zombies mode had very little story until BO2. It was mostly fan speculation that eventually became canon. Zombies was made in a rush as a direct response to horde mode in Gears 2, so they didn't have time to make a story. The game came first, then the story followed.  




 I reddit on my phone a bit too, but usually where there's wifi ;) 




 Are stating its TL;DW or are you asking what it means?

It's too long, didn't watch. 

Not sure why people would come to comments section to tell me they didn't watch it because it's too long. I said its 4 hours in the title! 




 Yeah pretty much. I'm certain most of the story is fan fiction made canon anyway. I just wanted to refresh myself on what happened to the characters and such.  




 Good for you. You came here to say that anyway? Cool.  




 Damn. No way I'm paying 40 to buy the amount of souls needed. Sucks.  




 Good question.  




 Lol. Cheating scum.  




 I think so. I haven't done tower battle since April.  




 Can you get Revenant Sub-Zero and Revenant Jax from the gold Kombat pack or do you need to save for 3 years to buy the new pack for 850 souls? 




 My only advice is you must get all the challenges done, all of them. You'll fail if you don't. Make sure you know what the challenge is just before the fight loads. If you do all 5(?) in a row you get crazy points. I think I took part in about 7-10 towers before I won one.  




 I did. The ending was brilliant.  




 How can someone boast about a good team if they cheated to get them? I don't understand hack-boasters. It's like when people on GTA Online say "I'm level 12 and I've got a tank, a hydra, a buzzard, and 20 cars!"

I'm all like, "So? I'm level 352, I have all those too. The difference being I actually put the time in to earn them." 




 If you're not good enough to unlock the skin then you don't deserve it.

Nah I'm joking of course. But I'm not sharing my ID with anyone. Good luck in your search. 




 Or you could be interested in it. I plan to play GTA Online later. During the many and lengthy loading screens I'll be playing Mortal Kombat X Mobile and listening to this video. Maximising my gaming lol.  




 You could have the audio going on in the background if you're worried about the video taking too much of your time up.  




 So does she work at Jamba Juice or eBay? 




 Ok. 




 As will I. During loading screens on GTA Online lol. 




 Sweet! A new AVGN video I've not seen. How did I miss it? 









 What's HK 97? 









 Uh, no. what would be funny about watching Jayden Smith act. Fresh Prince is funny, this would be painful. 




 And people laugh at me and call me manes when I refuse to go on rides like these.

At least I'm still alive. 




 ...and one count of being an accessory to being a bear. 




 70k to (most likely) get 3 gear cards I've already got is pretty steep. Ooh I can improve an item so my recovery goes from 13% to 14%. I have more important things to blow my koins on, I can still get gear as season rewards.  




 Well that sucks. Oh well. Thanks.  




 Does anyone know if Revenant Jax will be Netherrealm, or Special Forces, or both?
