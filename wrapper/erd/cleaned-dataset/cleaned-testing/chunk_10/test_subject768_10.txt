 Xbox is for the serious, monster drinking, dorrito eating, rage quiting, prestige hacking, COD go hards that would put their K/D on a job resume. 

If you're a cod fanboy, Xbox is the console for you. 

If you're a gamer, then PC is the platform for you.  




 No it's for general questions too 




 press F2 and ask an admin for a RP school 




 erm /me and /do if you want it to be pirvate, /ado /ame and /status for perma features.
