 I've actually rolled a car when I was 14.  Valentine's day, 1998 to be specific.  Icy roads, and my dad was too drunk to drive, so I did.  I rolled a 1972 Toyota Corona.  Ever had to roll down the window to roll it up, and shove a 330 lb man off of you because he didn't wear a seat belt?  I have.  I won't drive anything anywhere if people aren't belted in.  

I don't care if I'm in ID.  No seatbelt = me no drive.  I'll turn off the car and put it in neutrual.  It's amazing how strong a 95 lb 14 year old kid is in a life threatening situation. (a 330 lb man who is my dad is laying on top of me, pick him up and throw him to the passenger side).  take off the seat belt, and fall down to the roof.  Then the mile long walk to the ranch house, "grandpa, I had a wreck, the cars upside down, and my dad is stuck inside".  That was a great year, 98.  Best year ever.  I wish I could re-live 02/14/98 every day.  NOT.  

We were supposed to have lobster that day.  Didn't happen.  My dad got his ass kicked by my grandpa, and I had to drive the now fucked up car home.  Fun times.  NOT.  I drove to town later that night and picked up papa murphy's, because the lobster went bad.  I haven't went on that road since. 




 OK, then why did when I hit whatever the hell I it at 50 in the ditch feel like I just punched in the chest by Hulk Hogan, (yeah, I used to watch wrestling a lot).  and why did it trap me until I figuured out to relax my chest and then the seat belt went slack?  50-0 in a couple of milliseconds is fun.  NOT! 




 I didn't notice any give when I was a dumbass 19 year old kid driving down the road trying to read my mail.  One second, on the road, the next, 20 feet down, and desperatly trying to stop, (and couldn't because I was literally in the water and going 50), , and then hit something under water so hard that it sunk my stereo reciever in my dash by a foot, and almost got hit in the head by by sub, (unsecure load).  I almost shot out my rear window until I realized "hey what If I try and roll down my driver window?.  It worked, so I crawled out.  I had my .45LC lined up and was about ready to shoot until I remembered "try rolling down the window before shooting".  That saved me about $710 of glass damage.  I had my finger on the trigger and was about ready to squeeze off a round.  I thought I was trapped because my doors wouldn't open.  That sudden stop, (still don't know what I hit underwater when I was in that ditch even 12 years later, but that sudden stop hurt like hell). 




 I'm 32 years old and just figured it out when I yelled it at the TV.  Yes, I heard the phrase when I was 12, but didn't know what it meant, so I never said it.  I think I was watching a porno, because they did get a room.  O.o

 Well answer this:  Have you got any updates pushed to you through WU? 




 Yes, if MS was a person, and they had a house, and I knew where they lived, and really intended on doing it.  In order for a crime to be committed, you have to have the 3M's met:

**Means:**  (nope, not a physical person with no physical address to firebomb)

**Method:**  (Duh, outlined above)

**Motivation:** (Nope)

Unless all 3 requirements have been established, no crime committed. 




 That's why the HANS restraining device is mandantory in NASCAR and NHRA racing.  Don't have it?  Simple solution.  You're not on the track.  Dale Earnhardt's death made it mandatory in NASCAR.  I remember that wreck on the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500 very well.  I broke the news to my dad that "Earnhardt is dead!". :(  We never watched NASCAR again together again.  I tried back in 2007, but it just wasn't the same without "The Intimidator".  Haven't bothered watching it since.  I used to keep a race schedule 2 years in advance.  It used to be our "church".  Now, I have no idea when the next race is besides "sunday?" 




 Good point.  Didn't think of that!  I was just thinking "they are safer, and required to get on the track if you race in the 12's or faster, so why not everybody?"  No, I can't race in the 12's.  I was at the track last week, and I pulled in 17.913s, (yeah, I'm slow, (it's a 97 blazer for god sakes). 




 In WA, it says I either have to have a windshield, or wear goggles.  (understandable).  Legally, there's nothing stopping me from chopping off the entire top of my truck off, and driving it down the road with a pair of ski goggles on.  (no, I'm not doing that, I've already drove with a failed heating fan, and that was cold enough to freeze up the inside of the windshield so I had to put on my shades and hang out the window at 60 to see where the hell I was going).

Good point about the noise ordinances. :)  I completly forgot about that. :)  I rebuilt my father's 93 Geo Metro back in 2001, and decided "fuck the exhaust, and just ran a straight pipe.  He got a warning about 121 dB :D  I put on a muffler. :D I didn't bother with the cat since no emissions control around here.  (why I put on a glass pack on a Metro?  because I had an extra one, so why not?)  It met noise ordinances. :) 




 Except for my 77 impala, (where I did weld the doors shut), I actually have had to get into my rig several times NASCAR style because some asshole parked too close too me.  Wasn't exactly fun, but I can do it. 




 OK, assuming the DMV approved it, and gave me registration, what would a cop do if I got pulled over for I don't know, taking an improper right turn? but when stopped, and he looked in, I was strapped in like I'm on the track, and was wearing a full helmet, a 5pt restraining device, and had a HANS restraining device strapping my head in to I didn't snap my neck in case I did a Dale Earnhardt, and had to actually take off all of my saftey gear before I could even get access to the glove box to get my DL/Reg/Ins?  (No, I don't have like $250,000 to put into such an old truck, so this question is purely hypothetical).  For the sake of argument, noise ordinances don't exist, so I didn't get stopped for being as loud as a jet taking off. 




 Because I'd have to get in and out of the rig by climbing through my window?  (not exactly easy access, but I can do it). 




 And give is good why?  I kind of like not eating the steering wheel.  Oh, the air bags on my truck don't work, and my current one is the first one I've had that actually has air bags.  This is also the first rig that I've had that has ABS. 




 OK, I did a lot of stupid shit to my rig when I was 16, (my door wouldn't lock shut one time, so I slammed it shut, and welded it closed).  I had to get out of my car NASCAR style for 2 years until I got into a head-on and kind of had to get rid of that rig because I ruined it).  But as a grown ass man, I know how to fix a door that won't latch shut, and I don't need a mig welder anymore.  :)  But good point.  Although the thought of duct tape never entered my mind to use for anything besides the air intake manifold, (and it worked).

Hmm, so what if I had endless money, and decided to convert my truck into a "race ready, street legal" truck, and got pulled over in a converted 1997 Blazer LT obviously purposly rebuilt for the track, but met legal requirements to be a legal road vehicle.  (hey, if people can ride horses on the street, why can't I legally drive my hypothetically converted truck down the road so long as I obey all laws?)  Let's say I met all NASCAR/NHRA requirements, but also had indicators, plates, lights, (and in some areas a muffler and cat)?  (and if I had endless money, there's no way in hell I would waste my time with my truck, I'd just build one). 




 OK, what if I got my truck track ready, but had all the legal indicators, brake lights, regular tires, plates, headlamps, but for all intents and purposes, it was a race rig?  (weld doors shut, replace all glass with plexiglass, have mesh netting, strip out all passenger seats, put in a racing seat, a 5 pt restraint harness, a HANS restraint device, and dropped in a 454 with dual quads, and straight piped my exhaust.  Basically make a street-legal, race ready 97 Blazer LT. 




 damn it. 




 I've rolled a car when I was 14, and my dad wasn't wearing a seatbelt.  I was.  A 330lb man landed on a 95 lb child.  He was too drunk to drive, so I did.  It was Valentine's Day, 1997.  It's amazing how strong a 14 year old kid is when he's upside down and trapped.  After that incident, I refuse to move a vehicle unless everybody is belted in.  I literally picked him up off of me, and thew him back to the passenger side.  Then the mile long walk back to the ranch house.  That was fun.  NOT.  It was confusing enough getting out of a standard seat belt in a 1972 Toyota Corona, (after I shoved my dad off of me).  I had to crawl UP to the underbody of the car and get out.  and roll my window down, (which is now up), to climb out.  My granddad kicked my dad's ass because he was too drunk to drive, and had to pull us out with a D6.  Yes, the car still drove when righted, (but very shittily).  I had to drive home because my dad was drunk, and just got his ass kicked.

Good point about the fire though.  Had it caught on fire, I would have likely decided "fuck this!" and just ran.  Getting out of a 5pt restraint harness would have been almost impossible.  That's a good reason. 




 Who the hell would duct tape it to I don't know what?  It has to be installed to the frame of the vehicle, and with lag bolts, and with lock washers and a 150lb/in torque wrench.  Ideally, spot welded so you can be **absolutely sure** it isn't going anywhere EVER.  So why don't NHRA and NHTSA have the same requirements for vehicles, (besides the fact nobody goes 150 on the highway)? 




 Yes, you will. :) 




 Ah! :) 




 Yeah, but why?  I could get behind the wheel of the 51 ford (with no belts at all), and go 60MPH down the highway, (legal speed limit), if I wanted to, but I won't because I don't want to be road pizza.  I think a **minimum** of a 3 pt restraining harness should be mandatory, but if you want to strip your rig and make it a race vehicle, you should be allowed to, (so long as your street legal).  Why would they care if I gutted my truck, put in a roll bar, plexiglass shielding, welded my doors shut, put in a roll bar with cross members, put in a racing seat, and a 5 pt restraining harness with a HANS restraint device, and wore a helmet, and drove down the road?  (I mean besides the fact I'm taking a truck designed for the track out on the street).  

**EDIT:** Are they really that worried that I won't be able to reach my radio to change the station? (which you shouldn't be doing while driving anyhow). 




 OK, so why not for the driver's seat at least?  Assumedly, an adult is going to be driving, and not an 8 yo kid, (unless you're rural, but that's a different story).  Also, what if I were to strip out my truck, and install a racing seat and a 5 pt restraining harness, and wear a helmet, and install a HANS restraining device, and out roll bars in my truck?  (other than I would obviously be taking a rig meant for the track out on the street).   














 The Insider program is now closed, as are the activation servers until the 29^th.  But yes, 10240 is RTM, and you'll have no problems updating to the "final" release. :) 




 I'll burn down their house, and set bombs to detonate in the drive and lawn, and then shoot anybody who leaves the property.  :grr:

(not really, I'm already running 10240, so no rush).

 They've had that page up for 3 years now.  It's just flat out wrong.  When I called the cable company earlier this year, I had a question about why in the 90's that I was able to pick up cable TV with my antenna if I pointed it SSE, and had a complete channel line up, and would it work now?"  (yes, it really did happen, I was able to pick up a cable system over 30 miles away if the conditions were right).

They said likely a signal leak from a neighbor, but "it won't work now because every device connected to the network must be authorized."  I know that statement is false, because my analog TV just works like it always has, and my HDTV works perfectly fine to pick up both analog and ClearQAM service.  I never registered my serials with them, and just plugged them into the wall.  Cable here works just as it always has.

I still haven't gotten a satisfactory answer to how come I was able to pick up a city over 30 miles away cable TV system on my antenna back in the 90's. 




 We already have that.  It's called a Union.  Join one if you want.  Nobody is stopping you. 




 No you don't.  You could say "Fuck you, I quit!", and walk off the job mid shift, and they can't do anything legally about it.  You won't get a good reference, but there is no legal obligation for you to give them any notice at all. 




 Already have it with the Google Wallet "tap to pay".  I don't use it.  I even have an SGSIII i9300 that supports NFC.  It's faster to just use my card. 




 It will update your build to:

 Wrong about at will employment. While you can be terminated for any/no reason, you can also quit for any/no reason. If it is not "at will", it is by definition, compulsory. Somebody is being forced to do something against their choice under penalty of law. We had that once. It's called 1776-1865. 




 The FHA already says you can't get evicted or refused rental because of sexual orientation. 




 My bank just issued me a card that does exactly this. Large retail stores like Walmart are already set up to do it, and have been for several years. I still use the mag swipe though, as it is faster. 




 You could call it your "liquid lunch", or "supper in a sack". 




 You realize that tools exist for this, and it's [pretty cheap](http://www.techtoolsupply.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=RMT-LTT7)?

 Or you know, just plug it into the wall, and do a channel scan. :)  4 years ago, I got all of the music channels too, but they cut those off, (actually I had hundreds of free digital channels).  Now I get all 68 analog channels, and 25 digital.  Analog isn't going anywhere.  The only reason I have a [STB3500II](http://www.amazon.com/3500STBII-Multi-Function-Converter-Recording-Playback/dp/B00GOILYB6/ref=dp_ob_title_ce) on my upstairs TV is because it's an "old" NTSC TV from 2002, so I need the $35 box (that I own), to get the digital channels.  On my living room TV, I just have it plugged in to the wall. 




 Yeah, "$10 for basic broadcast"  The equipment and taxes cost more than the "special offer" for TV. 




 TWC charges $2.75/mo for a DTC.  (completely unneeded here, even though the website says I do).

 Sure there is.  Use [Lynx browser](http://lynx.isc.org/lynx2.8.7/index.html). 




 I still have full analog and ClearQAM service here.  TWC on the phone says "you need a cable box".  Um, no you don't.  They say even for basic service, you need a DTC for $4/mo.  No, you don't.  Just plug your TV into the wall, and away you go.

  [MS15-078](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/MS15-078) is the patch for a vulnerability in Microsoft font driver that could allow remote code execution.

The security bulletin stated:

This security update resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted document or visits an untrusted webpage that contains embedded OpenType fonts. This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows.

Under vulnerability information, Microsoft wrote:

OpenType Font Driver Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2426

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library improperly handles specially crafted OpenType fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability, such as by convincing a user to open a specially crafted document, or by convincing a user to visit an untrusted webpage that contains embedded OpenType fonts. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library handles OpenType fonts.

When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had information to indicate that this vulnerability was public but did not have any information to indicate this vulnerability had been used to attack customers. Our analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. 




 They cannot tell what you are watching.  A TV is just a receiver, and does not transmit.  The only way they can tell if you are watching is if you have a cable company cable box.  You could watch it to your heart's content.  If caught, (doubtful), the most that will happen is they'll put a trap back on the line, and one day you'll come home and have either nothing on TV, or basic service (local broadcast channels), only.  

Then just wait a week, and go outside and take off the trap yourself, and you'll have all the channels again.  You can get a terminator removal tool on eBay for like $5, and a P-key is about $15.  The chances of getting caught are nil.

**EDIT:**  Just don't report a cable TV outage. ;) 




 So go buy one? Ski-Doos are pretty fun, but kind of expensive. Also, it's not going to be of much use if you don't get a lot of snow. 




 The chances of getting caught are almost none. I hooked myself up to cable by doing exactly that over a year ago. No issues at all. 




 They won't let me put it on the roof, (no building modifications allowed), so I have to build a stand for it.  I can't seem to get the pole mounted to that flat piece of wood stable.

You'll have access to everything. :)

 I still prefer the control panel.  I only use the settings  panel to check for WU, since that's the only way to do it.  If they left the entire legacy control panel in place, I would use it exclusively.  "God Mode" is still available if you want it.  Create a new folder (anywhere), and name it:

     GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}

You'll have access to everything. :)

 That fixed the weather live tile, but didn't do anything for the secondary time that I have set up. 




 It works fine on the ClearQAM channels, and even some of the analog channels station ID automatically on my TV.  However, only ClearQAM has the OSTVG actually functional. 




 10240 **IS** RTM.  Between now, and 9 days from now, it's mostly going to be bug fixes.  Yes, you will update to the retail release, (and beyond). 




 You read it correctly. :) 














 I sort of doubt it would even run on my EeePC 1000HD.

 Because of the enormous weight of the towers, they have to be anchored to solid beddrock, or a large concrete slab with enough mass to prevent the tower from falling over in high winds.  After that part is done, it is built in a lattice structure, much like the core of a skyscraper is erected.  The diagonal struts add structural integrity to the tower, and make it more resistant to twisting in the wind, (or in event of an earthquake).  It is typically built from a wide base, to a narrow top where the transmission antennas are, and if extra stability is needed, guy wires are added to the tower, and angled out at a 45 degree angle for maximum torsion strength.

Aim it at like 10 degrees, and do a channel scan.  You'll get the most channels. 




 KQQQ is still run by men, (and women), not some machine.  Well, the computers control the format, but there's a man sitting behind the machine, and can interrupt at any time.  The radio station let me go take a tour of it, and it looked **completely** different than what I was thinking it would be.  I was expecting it to be like the movie Good Morning Vietnam, it wasn't.  It blew my mind. 




 What if you put the antenna hieght at 35 feet? 




 Didn't work.  You need to copy the link they give you.  Here's my TVFool:

 I have a solution to that!  buy a P-Key.  Hook yourself up.  Problem solved. 




 I actually still have an analog feed to my apt.  I get digital and analog feeds, with no STB needed.  It works just as it always has.  I don't have to rent equipment, just plug it in to my TV, and do a channel scan.  Away I go.  Not a problem  I get 67 analog channels, and 25 digital.  I also have TWC.  I know this, because I hooked myself up. :) 




 So put up an antenna?   




 Radio is still the best option for emergency signals.  If you have a crank radio, (or a battery powered unit), it's much better in an emergency than a TV.  When the power is out, you don't get TV or internet, but the radio is always there. 




 Night watchman at a bank? 




 Motorola SB5101. :) 




 IIRC, the cost to install a speed limit sign is $550.  The cost to install one with a speed measurer thing in it?  $560.  so why not?  Hmm, come to think of it, why do speedometers use gears?  Why not shoot a radar beam directly in front of the vehicle so you know exactly how fast you're going?  It wouldn't cost any more to do the initial setup with a new vehicle.  (except it wouldn't be user serviceable). 




 The same way those speed limit signs on trailers with radar speed measurers are?  I actually like them, because it lets me know how accurate my speedometer is.  My radar detector lets me know about speed traps, (duh), but when I see one of those speed limit signs with a speed indicator, I drive EXACTLY the speed, and pass it, then see how accurate I am.  Go figure, if I keep my tires to manufacturers rating, I'm under.  If I inflate to the max, I'm exactly accurate. O.o.  I don't get it. 




 Dear god.  I only get 30 MBPS, and that's only because I uncapped my modem.  I'm paying for 20 Mbps.  I don't even know what I would use that speed for.  Downloading the entire fucking internet? 




 Dickhole.  I mean so I can pass it and make sure my speedeometer is calibrated correctly, (or of not, adjust my speed accordingly)  Oddly enough, since I over inflated my tires to 44 PSI, I'm actually accurate now. :) 




 Very true!

 It was. :)  When my friend came over she asked "what are all these wires for?"  I said "Let me show you", and turned on my TV.  I had a signal as clear as cable. :)  I was in the middle of BFE, but I had a clear as signal as the town kids.  :)  When I turned on my TV, she had 2 words, "holy shit!" :)

Asshole. 




 I literally wired my room as a giant antenna.  I had loops, and even ran a wire on my roof to catch more signal.  If it was broadcast, I could pick it up. :)  Not a problem.  I lost the local ABC affiliate some nights when it was raining, but I had pretty good signal otherwise.  Some channels like the CW were snowy, but I could pick it up. :)  I was pissed off for 10 years because I missed the last episode of ST:V, but since now I have the internet, I already watched it, (10 years later), I'm not pissed anymore. :)  It was sleeting that night, and I couldn't pick up the local FOX affiliate.  I was pissed off, I tried everything, including going out to the camper and hooking up my TV.  Still couldn't pick it up. :( 




 You know you're starting to get old when the shows of your youth are aired on TV land and Nick At Night.  When I grew up, Nick At Nite played Mr Ed, and now they air "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air", (it used to be on NBC at 1900 hrs). When I was a youth, TVLand didn't exist.  They now have a station called "Antenna TV".  I'm old enough to remember when that was the only way I could get TV.  I was living in a giant antenna, and got 2,3,4,6.7,10,12,22,24,28,35,40.  I wired my room to be a huge antenna.  One of my friends came over during the summer of 95, and saw my setup.  "Bad reception?" was her question.  "No, it's actually pretty good now, I have 12 channels now! Wanna watch TV?" 




 I already got counseled by a dietician in the hospital.  I now have several recipes for high calorie, high protein, high fat meals.  I just need to buy a blender.  And yes, my step mom is sort of mean, (and hits hard), but I obviously need it, or she wouldn't do it.  (Yes, I still get hit even though I'm a fully grown man). 




 If you see Kay, tell her I'll see you in tea.

(Fuck, Cunt) 




 I've been saying this for decades. "Salad is what food eats". 




 Pull the battery, and sit for 30s. Insert battery, start machine. Problem solved. 




 So they could get so stoned that they couldn't get up? 




 I was born in 83.
