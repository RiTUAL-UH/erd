 Bite my shiny metal ass 




 I'm a conservative. 




 Oooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Babe! 




 Haha I actually don't retain in books as much as I wish I would. But I think I may do Neverwhere then Cat's Cradle or Sirens of Titan and then Anansi Boys. Awesome. 




 At least it can fit into tight corners that a regular pitchfork cant! 




 Awesome, I thought American Gods was awesome. I vaguely remember Anansi, I think he was the spider guy? I would probably sparknote the book real quick before I read it. 




 I've read American Gods and Graveyard book, but that was 3-4 years ago. I'm looking forward to these books! 




 Alright thanks! I think I'm gonna read Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, then Cat's Cradle next 




 pitches a fork 




 Shaq is such a likable dude, I listen to his podcast every week. Says he's an entertainer and will never turn kids down for a picture in public. He's hilarious and a great entertainer 




 Yeah I mean it wasn't an excruciating read, only a couple days. But yeah you're right it basically was 150 pages. Maybe I just need to get more used to his style/prose so I can appreciate it more 




 I don't know how long it's been since you read BoC, but is the main character Vonnegut and the real life things he mentions, actually in his life? 




 Thanks! My buddy has Sirens of Titan, so he is gonna lend it out to me when school starts back up! 




 Interesting. Thanks, I'll probably do that in the order you said, does he keep a lot of recurring characters? 




 My friend also recommended Siren of Titan, how does that compare? 




 So I understood all the America satire that Vonnegut was using, but am I wrong to think that it was really long-winded? After reading the 300 page book, I couldn't help but think that it could have been 150 pages. I want to read more Vonnegut, but I don't know if it's going to be more of the same or not. I read a brief description of Cat's Cradle and Slaughterhouse-five and they both sounded like American Satires, PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.


I would like to know if I should keep on going, or maybe I missed something completely with the book that went over my head. 




 Awesome, yeah that's the extent I know of it haha. Cheers. 




 I really liked the Sonmi-451 story a lot. I love futuristic, sci-fi like that. I liked Sonmi, and I thought Timothy Cavendish's story was hilarious. 




 The Old Man and the Sea had me hooked, fairly short book that I couldn't put down and finished it the same day I started it. 




 Did you like Cat's Cradle? I haven't read it, but only hear positives about it. I just finished Breakfast of Champions today, it's an easy read, took me about 3-4 days to read. Lots of American satire, as usual.  




 Ah! Just the thread I was looking for, I was about to make a separate post. Okay, so I just started reading Neverwhere, what a coincidence. It says that it has similarities to Alice In Wonderland. How pivotal is that to the enjoyment of the story? Because I have never read/watched Alice In Wonderland. I've read Graveyard Book by Neil, even though I never read Jungle Book. Will there be any issues? 




 I saw the guy that runs SETI speak when he came to WVU, I'm stoked! 




 Wow, it seems like yesterday it came out. I like that comment about backing vocalist haha. Actually, in some respects, John has a better voice than Anthony. 




 I think that album has some of John Frusciante's best work, including some of his solo stuff. He's one of the guitarists that is just so in-tune with their sound that you can't separate them. 




 I always love that during Gilmour's solos when he doesn't play a lot of notes I succession, but he has them long and strung out. Most notably in Time and the 2nd solo in Comfortably Numb. He also does it in echoes. I love guitar solos in that fashion, also explains why Wet Sand by RHCP is one of my favorite songs ever. 




 I love it! I feel like more people are against it than like it. There are a few shitty lyrics like "let's go do it" and the parts that sound like that. But the rest is catchy and fun to sing to. The chorus gets stuck in my head like a bug.

Also, I guess this "technically" the first post-Floyd solo album. Obviously the argument could be made and roger and yada yada yada. But it's just a thought. 




 THERE AREN'T OVER 50 PRESIDENTS, PLS 




 Damn shame, Nien has been playing so well in recent weeks after every getting dumpstered in the first few weeks. Shame he made that mistake after a great game. 




 Is that the Haunted Tarmac of Queztocl? It's said that over 100 people have gone onto that tarmac only to be never seen again. Wonder why these spuds managed to live. 




 fair enough, agree to disagree
 




 I don't have to believe wikipedia if I don't want to. Don't be a dick. 




 Is this a real show? That joke blew 




 I sang so hard that it killed my baby... fiction 




 Heaven forbid, I want to fraternize somewhere on reddit, when liberals make up a majority of the community. LOL 




 So 6:30 PM WEST, which translates to 1:30PM East Coast USA, I believe I'm -5 from GMT, but honestly I have no idea if Europe does any Daylight Savings Time 




 time zone? 




 When is the final, and do you know if its streamed? 




 Hmm. I could see why it could be considered one of the most underrated albums. A lot of this consensus on this sub is that Obscured by Clouds is one of the most underrated albums, but that depends on the person. I actually don't listen to this album as much as should, I like all the songs, except I don't really listen to Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast. 




 I'm just bustin your balls buddy 




 Devastating to hear this. Heart goes out to the families and community. 




 This is like the most famous video of lava underwater for some reason. I swear I've seen this shit in like Bill Nye The Science Guy and everywhere since 




 I know right. It's like, "thanks for showing me a subreddit where I won't be harassed." DOWNVOTE HIM FOR BEING APPRECIATIVE AND RUNNING! 




 YOU'RE ONLY POSTING THIS BECAUSE IT WAS ON COMEDY CENTRAL TODAY, AND YOU THOUGHT HEY CAITLYN JENNER FREE LINK KARMA. YOU GOT GOTTED 




 That's not a real thing 




 I'll get right on that 




 Okay, sorry about that, I must've missed that. Thanks for doing that. Appreciate it. 




 Comfortably Numb (Live) - Pink Floyd from their live album Pulse 




 Cheers 




 Also can there be a bit of a heads up? Meaning, "Here's our book club discussion calendar" so that I have time to read and then discuss. So it's not like hey we're talkin about this book, hopefully you've already read it. 




 I'm a conservative as well, is there anywhere we can go to talk about the issues in a different sub? 




 lol what is this? 




 I know the war obviously, dickshit. If I know the year the whitehouse was burnt down, I obviously know the war. You're a jackass 




 USA! USA!

EDIT: Lol Reddit hates America, who would have ever guessed that? Damn commies 




 I stay listening to Pink Floyd
 




 Those Corki rockets in game 2 looked like they were shot by Michael J. Fox 




 Not just in Europe, pretty much everywhere in the world, brochacho 




 Yeah if you wanna look like an ass hat. 




 That awkward moment when it was burnt down in 1814, and not 1812... 




 Fat Stanley 




 Because I'm passionate, I rarely post, I usually just leave the thread before posting. 




 I may be mistaken, but I think his dad was pretty radical too. I also wonder if foreign radicals have any influence in America 




 Just want to bring more attention since I see that it hasn't hit front page since it happened.

"Your dick!" - Charlie 




 Very true my friend, can't win on either side haha but it motivates me to strengthen my arguments and convictions  




 Yep, its tough for me, as a constitutional conservative, I bravely post on /r/politics or /r/news every once in awhile and get shredded. 









 I live in Georgia. Lived in Pennsylvania for my first 18 years and go to school in West Virginia. 




 No worries man 




 Fuuuuuuck that's awesome 




 I'm sorry, I don't know the Rand Paul thing with Rage Against The Machine. What happened?

EDIT: Unless you're talking about Paul Ryan...  




 I've seen lots inside. Hell, me and my roommates had one in our apartment last year. 




 Keep it up. Don't let people give you shit for an American flag. 




 Haha that's an awesome slogan for a leather jacket, I approve! 




 Are you a girl or a boy? 




 DISCLAIMER: THIS ISN'T A POST TO DISCUSS WHETHER YOU LIKE HIM OR NOT. OR WHETHER PF WOULD APPROVE OF HIM. THIS ISN'T THE APPROPRIATE SUBREDDIT FOR THAT. THIS IS JUST TO SHARE A PF QUOTE FROM HIS BOOK.

That being said. As I was reading through Rand Paul's book, "Taking A Stand" he referenced Pink Floyd and I thought it might be cool to share with you guys.

 Pink Floyd understood that genius needs to be left alone. Whether your ideas are politically correct or not, whether you're a painter or self-proclaimed prophet, the exhortation is to shine, to not let conformity dim your light: "Shine on, you crazy diamond."

 




 well my two degrees are very intertwined so it's not as bad as it seems. It would be bad if I were aerospace and civil engineering for instance. 




 We're lifting off severe sanctions on them that equate to around $800 billion, I believe. It opens them to more trade. We're also allowing them to develop nuclear weapons because our restrictions on that are basically nonexistent. 




 Dual major student currently studying aerospace and mechanical engineering, however, my internship is with industrial engineers 




 Cloud Atlas 




 Hershey, PA 
Didn't invent chocolate but we sell a shit ton of it 

EDIT: I could give ya guys a couple more facts about Hershey that you didn't know about if anyone's interested haha 




 I can't connect to the wifi at work since its a private network. I do download podcasts for offline listening, that's how I do it all. I also have a spotify subscription but I don't always remember or have time to download songs offline. Cheers mate 




 I don't want to go over my data limit but I like discovering new music over the work day, I haven't received the 75% message yet and my billing cycle ends the 26th. 




 I'll try to give you the conservative view point since lots and lots of other redditors will give you their view in a flash. It really should be a non-partisan issue but I assume it comes with one party taking credit for the deal rather than the other. Anyway, from my view, this deal does nothing to perturb Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. They closed down thousands of centrifuges, but they still have 5000 running. It took Pakistan 3000 to develop a bomb. Iran has also funded terrorism in the region. Just early in the week they were burning American flags and saying death to America. The equivalent of lifting their trade restrictions is like a country giving the US $8 Trillion. They also have four american hostages, 1 of whine we know has been tortured. He was running an underground Christian church.


They are radicals and I don't think I see many benefits from this deal.

EDIT: Their places can only be inspected if given 14 days notice. It can also only be inspected by Iran's allies or something similar (I'm blanking, sorry). So US inspectors aren't allowed in. 




 Trying to push out a squeaky fart 




 This is kinda sorta heart breaking 




 I can't see my forehead 




 I want a subreddit where I can discuss various topics with people I a civil manner. Like legitimate discussions with out radicals on either side of the issue down voting everything 




 Hershey PA now living in Georgia 




 Gladiator fights 




 Made me chuckle a lot 




 Excuse me while I go cry 




 Yes, there's actually ways, at least in 4th gen to increase your odds of finding a shiny. A buddy of mine had around 40 shinies, all gained legitimately with the pokeradar and other tactics. 




 Halo series... well 1 through 3. 




 I've seen BWP, I thought it was pretty freaky, and the real footage definitely had an adverse effect. This may actually be one of the freakiest movies I've seen. 




 I love true stories because of how personal they feel. I've heard about Mothman before, out in San Francisco if I'm not mistaken. Any recent develops, wasn't it around the 80's?
 




 I learn about new subs everyday, cheers mate. 




 How do you feel about them? I feel like my expectations for cinematics/production may not really scare me. But as far as movie goes are they top notch?
