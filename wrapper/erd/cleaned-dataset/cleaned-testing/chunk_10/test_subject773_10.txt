 It just raises so many questions.  What is it?  Why does it only have one arm?  What is that thing growing out of its head?  Why does that thing look evil?  Is that a bowtie on the side of it's head or an ear?  What drugs was the person on who made this? 









 These are wonderful!  Thank you for sharing. :) 




 I had to go the custom route thanks to having elf feet and Hulk calves.  I swear by Dehners.  They made me my boots for $900 and I've been wearing them for the last 10 years.  Really good product.  I got measured locally and then boots magically came!  They can tell you where to get measured near you.  http://dehner.com/ 




 Wonderful!  I love seeing other saddleseat folks on here. :) 




 Upvote for sexy forearms, AND upvote for the Cubs. :) 




 Since you don't do the processing afterwards, do the jars seal shut?  And how long to these keep?  Do you have to keep them refrigerated?  Sorry for all the questions but I tried to make pickles last hear and they were HORRIBLE, so I want to make awesome ones this year. :) 









 Turtrucken? 




 "In our constitution there are many rights: the right to housing, the right to education, the right to health. But I don't find the right to park." -  Enrique Pealosa, former mayor of Bogota, Colombia

People act like parking is some kind of right they have wherever they go, and if it isn't available there needs to be an "improvement." I, however, see removing parking as an improvement.

 He's adorable!  Does he have a notch in one ear? 




 Got one of these last season.  Roommate called it my "seasonal tramp stamp." 




 Upvote for the rabbit named Microwave.  




 I'm a 2008 alum too, and I'm considering moving from my current 2 bedroom.  Could you PM me some details about your property? 









 Best high horse picture ever!!! 




 My mom was cleaning out the pantry around Christmas and found a box of Ziploc baggies with the VR Troopers on them.  She is using them for EVERYTHING. 




 I find that if I eat solid food before I show it doesn't sit well -- enter Organic Valley single serve chocolate milk boxes!  They're like juice boxes but full of milk, and they don't have to be refrigerated!  The combination of protein and a bit of sugar and fat gets me through my ride.  After that I eat ANYTHING.   




 My trainer once forgot that I don't weigh much and threw me over the other side of the horse! 









 So much love!!! 




 There's one of these in my hometown that my dad helped build.  They're tearing it down soon and replacing it with something more "modern.". So sad. 




 I still have my Ninjor action figure.  




 Hi everyone.  I have a little side business called Bling for the Ring that sells vintage stock pins and lapel pins, offering riders something unique to accessorize with.  I sell primarily in the Morgan and Saddlebred world, since those are the breeds I show with, but would love to tap into the Hunter/Jumper, Dressage, and Arab worlds.  

Does anyone know of any message boards where I could post, facebook pages I could like, or any other ways to reach out to these disciplines/breeds?  I have an Etsy page and can ship internationally, so the sky's the limit!!!  

Any help would be great.  If you're curious about what I'm selling, my Etsy page is here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/blingforthering

Thank you all in advance! 









 What a beautiful girl, and what a long life!  Do you have any of her tail hair?  When my horse passed I got a necklace made of her tail hair braided together with some of her son's hair.  It is one of my most treasured possessions.  




 And now we are dating!  *swoons over /u/manifest_reverie* 




 Pita's cake is almost as cute as he is!
 




 Yes!!!  And now I even remember that theme music.  Now I want to watch it... 




 I'm dying to remember the name of the show with the two cats dressed in blue and red (left edge).  Does anyone remember?  I recall loving that show. 




 Rhinoceros pin?  Interesting... the 90's were a special time. 




 This is awesome!  Thank you! 




 I "awwww"ed out loud! 




 Hair ribbons have been claimed.  Thank you! 




 I've has these forever and never used them.  My mom got them before she realized they weren't used in saddleseat.  One is black, one is forest green, and one is navy.  I'll gladly mail them to whoever might be able to use them!  I just feel bad throwing them out when they could be used.  Just PM me! 









 Amazing work!  And your fiance is a mega ladyboner. 









 Where in IL?  I'll be driving to Rockford. 









 Max is brave!  My horse thinks cows are going to kill him in his sleep or something. 




 I am crying tears because you have a fiancee.  :( 




 I'm more interested in the sign that appears to have a guy Irish stepdancing on it.
 




 I want to know about the Pegasus fabric!  What the hell is that? 




 My mom still does her Tae-Bo religiously.  In her defense, it's working.  She looks incredible for 66. 




 I always got stuck in that hamburger cop thing.  I don't know why, but I could never figure out how to get out of the part with the bars, and my mom would have to somehow pry me out. 




 I was just stuck in traffic.  Looks like they're off the highway now, but there's still a major gapers block.  Northbound is worse than southbound. 




 Bun Mi if he's into Vietnamese sandwiches.  They are crazy tasty. 




 From one pineapple-themed username to another, I salute you. 




 I miss when they used to actually stamp the date into the end of the can instead of printing it on, and then you could get the coveted end slice with the date on it.  Mmm...cranberry numbers. 




 That underground village shopping area is the stuff of nightmares.  I remember similar places like that from when I was a kid.  I still have a fear of places that are made to look like the outside but are inside.  Not sure if there's word for that phobia... 




 Wonderful, thank you!  Will you be going?  We could make it the world's smallest Reddit meetup.  :) 




 Any details on when and where?  I'm a historic preservation professional and I'd love to go. 









 The orange scent was my favorite too!  I used to scratch it really sparingly to save it. :). In fact...I still do. 




 Nope, Minnesota. 




 People do jump in there, so I think it's a pretty standard height. 




 I want to ride Buster!  I would look like a flea on a dog's back up there! 




 It's not oddly short, so it must be the angle and Scooter's giantness. :)
