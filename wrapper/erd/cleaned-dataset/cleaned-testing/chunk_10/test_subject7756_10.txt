 google it, it comes up in a lot of places 



































































































 have you READ brietbart???? 





























 dude, the entire POINT of the civil war was to defend slavery. the stars and bars was the flag of the confederacy. ergo, it's fucking racist. 



















 riiiiiiiiight, because a flag that stands for the segregation of the races is TOTALLY equal to a flag that represents a minority who have been hunted, killed, discriminated against, bullied to the point of suicide, shunned, banished, tortured, and hounded so far deep in the closet that we're sucking dick and licking pussy in Narnia.

totally equivalent.
 

















































 It's Breitbart, Poe's Law applies to the entire site 








































































































 yeah, but at least bernie can shift the party's priorities to the left. dont forget, hillary DID try to get health care coverage. she'll most likely push for single payer, prolly towards the end of her second term, when the dems have won back the house 



















  I guess I'm worried that I'll make this choice, and then regret it. Or not do it and never be happy...

ah, the eternal dilemma of a trans person. damned if you do, damned if you dont. that's something i struggled with for the better part of 30 years (i've known since i was 7, came out when i was 39)

i dont have much to offer, except that as much as i pushed it away, and LORD knows i tried my hardest, it always came back with a vengeance. i just ran out of energy to fight it, and gave into the NEED to be a girl.

i'm much happier now, but i had to go thru a whole lot of shit to figure that out. i envy the kids who just know, and fight like hell to come out. 

 HUG 

i dont envy you the choice you have to make, and i wish i could offer more advice than "i'm sending positive vibes". but that's part of the journey that each of us has to figure out on our own.

 i love this thread 




 yeah, google the story and click on the link from the search results, that's how i read it. 














 i dunno, beats the fuck all out of me. normies are strange sometimes......  



















 what fucking difference does it make?? it still doesnt give anyone the right to discriminate against somebody because of their sexual orientation regardless if it were a choice or not.

 who cares? doesnt mean you get to shit on people's rights even if it IS a lifestyle choice(it aint, but that's another argument altogether) 



















 Pride right now, for a lot of us, is a celebration of us surviving coming out of the closet. let the haters hate. we'll have the twinks in codpieces hanging from the sides of floats. we'll have the drag queens standing 7 feet tall with their beehive hairdos and sequined ball gowns. we'll have the big hairy bears holding hands in their leather harnesses. 

as much as queer culture has been assimilating into the mainstream, there will always be that element that  sets us apart. that comes from being a part of a minority, we will always be "different" than other people. and there's nothing wrong with that. it's perfectly normal for us.

and i'll leave you with Nomi's Pride speech from Sense8 because i havent heard a better one yet.

 if you were a trans guy? yes. 

















































 i used to fly off the handle pretty regularly, once i start hrt, that all went away. i survived testosterone poisoning! 




 understood 




 please be civil 




 please be civil 







































 UNofficially, the number of trans people who were on hrt before Chelsea was through the roof. i personally know 2 MtFs and 3 FtMs who went on hrt. usually about right at the end of their 5th year. after they got out, the VA had no problems issuing them hormones. 




 who else did they do it for? 































































































































































 welp, here's where i put my mod hat on and say that i honestly believe that everybody should have a script if at all possible. ONLY because it's better to transition under medical supervision. that being said, i also know MANY trans people who dont have access to a doctor to transition and who have gone down the road of DIY. they know the risks they're taking, and i will assume that you do too. 




 ha, my endo had me on duta, but my T was so low that i didnt really need it, the estrogen was enuff to suppress the eveel T.

anyways, CanadaDrugs has 60 for $96 





























 lol 


































 oh they're completely disgusting, ANYONE who would use brennan as a spokesperson loses any and all credibility with me.

i'm just saying that there ARE people who detransition, and their trans journey is just as valid as ours. 

The problem here is that Cummings and Lopez are trying to impose THEIR outlook as the only one true way. I'm sure it seems that way to them, but it's wrong. wrong in every way it can possibly be. 














 whoa, hold on now, i disagree with the message in the article that we should all just "accept the gender we were born with" but i know a few people who have de-transitioned. there's no one way to be trans, we each experience it a different way.  














 you have a point 

























































































 THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ARENT SOMETHING YOU MAKE FUN OF! YOU CANT JUST....

... well carry on then
