 Ive had insomnia almost my entire life, it is extremely difficult for me to fall asleep. But imagine insomnia mixed with the fact my neighbours have 2 dogs, very large dogs at that. Each of them looking like they weigh about 150 Kilograms each. Yeah thats how large they are. They also have a tremendously loud bark. A bark loud enough to wake a bear out of hibernation. When do you think they like to bark the most? Thats correct. 2 A.M, mixed with my insomnia, sleep barely crosses my mind, not even for a second.

I require much medication for my insomnia, prescribed by a doctor, of course. I walked down the steps in pure darkness. Dark is not a fear of mine, in fact its more of my friend as I am quite an unsocial person. I dont enjoy people, they speak and have feelings. Although, personally I am quite amazing. The cabinet where my medication is, is in the bathroom. Ive never liked the bathroom, that walls have a weird pattern that would make someone with OCD lose their mind and go mad. I take my meds at double doses, my personal idea as normal doses make me see stuff thats not there in reality.

My house has a giant forest behind it that the children in the neighbourhood enjoy playing in. Its quite dense, perfect for seclusion. That forest contains many secrets, past and present, some are mine. But thats a story for another day. The infernal dog barking causes me to have a migraine.  I head back to my small bedroom and hide myself beneath layers of blankets to try and block out the sound of the dogs barking. Its impossible, the more layers, the louder the barking.

Due to the dogs barking I dont sleep. I check the alarm clock beside my bed on the nightstand. It reads 2:31 AM. I sigh, get up and head into the study. I open up my desktop and check my Steam activity. Of course nothing I have no friends on Steam. But as usual just another trade bot messages me every 10 seconds. I shut down the computer and sit in darkness for 10 minutes.

The barking continues. I cant hold out. I have to check what this infernal barking is directed towards. I head down the same stairs and catch sight of a lone light outside the window of my house. Someone left a note, a torch and a bicycle. Here is a picture of the bike by the way http://i.imgur.com/uexqWNJ.jpg

The note reads, Happy Anniversary! This confuses me deeply as well as sparking curiosity at what the torch was pointing towards the forest. Its not the perfect weather or time for a forest stroll, but I have nothing else to do. I head down a steep hill, there is a single set of footprints that go from my position to a cave carved into the side of a hill near a drain pipe.

I shine my torch into the drain pipe and see nothing out of the ordinary. I flash my torch into the cave. I catch a whiff of a foul odour being emitted from something or someone from the cave. I move away all of the foliage covering my entrance to the cave. I put down my torch.

I point it inwards into the cave.

I see the remains of a decaying human skeleton

Hey Dan I whisper. Happy Anniversary!
 




 It's mixing my favorite game with my favorite basketball team. I need it. 




 The dead body in my car. 




 The last 30 minutes of the final episode sure were rushed. 




 But... We saw in the E3 gameplay, the player picked up the Pip Boy off of a dead vault scientist... So you have to be inside. 




 Sutter likes symbolism, maybe Abel and Thomas would become members of Sons of Anarchy because they were *the sons of anarchy*. 




 Here's my list:

[This song contains a video spoiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4jG3QJKYR0)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lin6bvMMooE The fact they used this song in the first episode and the last made it even better.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsk7coyzG0A Again, when they played this topped the cake. 




 The scene that goes with it made it insanely awesome. 




 I believe Kurt wanted to end on hope, that's why we see Abel playing with the ring in the car. 




 My favourite part about the ending of that season, as he walks out after saying he doesn't like the mayor, he says "And the good guys need a win."  




 I believe Abel would only have to wield the weight. As Gemma said in one scene, Abel was going to be a son, Thomas was going to be different. In one of the last scenes, Abel is seen playing with the 'Son' ring given to him by Gemma the episode before. So my theory is Abel grew up to follow in Jax's footsteps, and basically the story repeats. You might never know, Wendy could of came back, married a Son then Thomas could've died. The story could basically repeat itself. 




 No the Reaper is the homeless lady. She tells Jax "It's time" right before he kills August Marks. I believe Jax was supposed to represent Jesus, the food the homeless lady was eating was bread, aswell as drinking wine. This represents the last supper as 2 items present at the the table. Then after Jax collides with the truck we see 2 crows pecking at a piece of bread on the side of the road, we then hear the collision confirming Jax's death. The crows fly away, Jax's blood touches the bread. It was Jax's last supper. 




 No man can outmatch my stealth skills aswell as my skills in unarmed combat. I will best any man I come across. 









 I threw my keyboard out the window and smashed it. 




 One playthough I went full unarmed, basically one hitted Enclave soldiers that were wearing power amor. Was not disappointed. 




 A dead body 




 EB Games (Australia) 




 Oh no. You missed the medicine one, looks like you can't get them all 




 One time I had unarmed at 100, and was using my fists to punch and I killed a Enclave Soldier with 1 hit... (Fallout 3) 




 A door that was designed to never open... ever. Although there is a secret entrance to the Vault, only accessible from the outside.
