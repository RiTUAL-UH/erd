 HR Super Sports with no ISOs, low as fuck. 




 But hey man, now you can spend money on your v8. Get some fat meat and lower it. But lower it first. I've seen 315s on stock height, it's not pretty. 




 I mean obviously we all want 18x10.5 for some fatties.  




 Trade.  




 Yooo, and we're both in AZ. Whaaaat! 




 Ayyyyyyyye! Your ride is wicked too man! I seriously want those wheels though dude, like really bad. 




 But... how.. D:? 




 Well ya, m8. 




 Or, ya know... We held the flags up, then shopped ourselves out. 




 Orion? lol 














 I get this reference. 




 Yeah same here! I thought it was just another "Regular Show", but damn, I was wrong. 




 If you could check, that'd be awesome. I'm starving over here for some Oreo O's!  




 And I must say, I never expected to love a show this much. Can't wait to see the new season! 




 Yeah, I've traded to SK before for Oreo O's.  damn, they went up in price... 2 years ago I got 6 boxes..  




 Hello! I'm from Arizona, USA. I am looking for a couple boxes of Oreo O's Cereal, and I know only South Korea makes them. I'm also looking for other random Korean snacks as well.
Just tell me what you're looking for and I will try!
Thank you! 




 Man, I went to my mom and started asking questions about what just happened. Looking back, I cringe about asking her what the stuff was and why it came from there. 




 I feel, brother. 




 My friend drives a Chevy, and we shoot shit about each other.  




 Fuck yeah, I have experience to comment! Where I worked, the franchise paid minimum wage to drivers (8.05) but after a checklist, you'd get a 50 cent raise (8.55) we made 5% on all deliveries, and only delivered 5-8 mins from the store. Not all that bad, can quickly get deliveries since it's all fast-paced, meaning I could do 12 deliveries in a few hours with 3 other drivers (this was at a slow store) so I'd come home with 30-50 bucks for a few hours of driving. (Though I had a V8 and got 13mpg so it all went to my tank) I wouldn't do it again. Not with my car. Management was good, but I rubbed them the wrong way once and got fired. Oh yeah, and the daily beatifications suck dick. There's a list of things that NEED to be done before the day is over and basically only drivers can do it. 




 I wouldn't call them Mustang Cobras, SVT GT500 sure, but SVT Cobras are 93-04 




 Nah, lmao. But that's what people think. ;) 




 Shitty service after you buy a car tho!!! Lmao 




 Nah. It's from it being cold. The photo is from around December I believe. 




 Yeah, right after the bridge. 




 I mean, I guess man. 




 315's. GG 



















 Betta try man. Or get a Cowl with Heat Extractors. 




 No Problem my dude! Enjoy! 




 What's it like living with a celebrity? 




 As far as I know, Gibson does exhausts, I do see new wheels on it though. 




 damn.. lmao, how much did you get? 




 I think just the emblem alone would look nice. 




 An exhaust. 




 I'll bite,
152
FN Orion - which was traded for an FN Road Rash!

And thats wicked, dont ever sell that knife, lol 




 Staaahp I'm blushing. The photographer is actually my friend named Daniel! Every photo I post is basically his! And hey man. We all started somewhere. I started with a beat up 1995 v6, and I loved it. It just takes a little time and you'll get the Mustang you want! I'm not even close to where I want to be, I'll probably slowly trade this up to Mach then a Terminator. And man, DSG, it really is one of the best New Edge colors, on any model! Again, thanks man. I means a lot! 




 I just wanna boost it so bad. I could finance a procharger from a member of my mustang club, he works at stage3motorsports, but it's like 500$ a month, or 5k out right. If rather pay my car off first. And thanks man. You always have something nice to say, which is awesome. 




 I wish I had a Torch Red, so.. Trade? Lol. Thanks man! I appreciate that. 




 Thank you! That means a lot! 




 Yeah, my friend focused on the headlight so the rear is blurry. It's not the best photo but it's something different, thanks man! I appreciate it. 














 Oh most definitely, they are superb at service. Just wish they had Clear Corners.. 




 It's just the headlights, it's about 200$ from StangMods. Though if you go Clear Corner, I'd try to do a Switchback lighting turn signal and HIDs. That amber bulb in a clear light is gonna annoy you. It annoys me so much. 




 I got them from StangMods. I personally don't like the customer service they have. And I now have water marks in my lights. So rip to me. 




 I got mine from StangMods, though I wouldn't recommend them. They're customer service is pretty shot. 




 I'm just dumb, I got it. My b man. 




 You there man? Whats your steam? 




 I got water marks in my driver side light now, so its not pretty. :((( Clear corners are wicked though, right? 









 If only OP would respond.. Lol. If the bread was in the Customer restroom. That's just begging to get in trouble. 




 Do I think it's gross, sure. But it's covered and unopened, I rarely ever saw us put bread in the restroom, sometimes you just gotta do what you need to do. Lol. 




 Ex-Sonic Employee here:
Mine has done this too, You probably were in the Employee restroom, (Which has an entrance from inside the store, and the outside.) We can't fit all the buns in one room so we'd put them in the restroom that no one is suppose to be in, until we could move stuff around and fit them, or the bread man would take them back on his truck. They're usually there for maybe 2 hours tops.

You probably were in the restroom you shouldn't have been, and no one uses it, at least at my old store, whilst food is in.
Plus that restroom looks clean af.
 




 Eh, I sold my first car to use as a down payment on my current car. 




 Hey man, You won! Sadly I can't trade it since I guess you can't trade unboxes until a week later. :/ But send me your Steam and I'll add you and give it to you on the 3rd! Sorry about the mess, I'm just really dumb. lmao, and you're welcome man! 




 Hey guys, I haven't done a give-away in a long long time, so I figure I might as well with the new update!
[It, as of this moment of posting, is worth about 4$](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/StatTrak%E2%84%A2%20USP-S%20%7C%20Torque%20%28Field-Tested%29)
[This is my profile.](http://steamcommunity.com/id/test_subject7776) Comment a number between 1-1000 and I'll pick a winner tomorrow around 6pm Mountain time.
Thanks guys! Have a good one.
EDIT: I just realized that since I unboxed it, I can't trade it ASAP, so I will add the winner and trade you on the 3rd of June (1 week from now) That is my fault, I'm sorry.


**GIVE-AWAY OVER, THANK YOU ALL WHO HAVE GIFTED FOR ENTERING** 




 Thank you man! Flawless everywhere but the usual front bumper/hood.  damn rocks... 




 Also, I know about my horrendous 4x4 status, I ordered some parts, just need to keep saving for the rest. ;) 














 Oh yeah. You start to see them everywhere, even when you're not driving. And when they're going the other way. 




 [The Roush 360R had White with Blue stripes, Looks amazing!](http://www.mustangworld.com/ourpics/news/select54/andrewsdvf4.jpg) 




 I need those wheels... Good wicked! 




 Hot, Looks really good! 




 You won't regret it, Borla's cost a lot, but my god, you are paying for music. And thanks man! I appreciate it, I try really hard lmao. 




 ye, ye. 




 It's just Borla ATAKs. I'm going for lowering springs next, then bigger wheels, and then I'll finish my exhaust. 




 Like sex. It has a drone, but as do all loud exhausts. Borla was definitely the way to go. I have a few sound clips on IG @Lol_You_Looked, it really sounds great when you get on it, in all gears, except 5th, 5th is really quiet. 




 At the moment, just Borla ATAKs, really wanna try and get BBK LTs and O/R H. 




 That actually looks very good, god damn! 














 Bruuuuh, Thats sick af. 









 If this was my house, I'd cry! It's a beautiful venue for weddings and the such. As we were shooting, 3 Disney Princesses went in. Was very tempting to ask them to pose for the photos. P.S. I might be getting lowering springs.  









 Thank god I live in the desert! 




 Booty Booty Booty.
How do you like 315's? I want some. 




 Mineral Gray tho.. ;) 




 A donation buttom would be 100x better, cause it doesn't hurt anyone, and helps the mod developers. 









 Friends '15 5.0 got hit in basically every panel and wheel and it wasn't totaled, so I'm assuming you're going to be fine. 




 Exactly! But winning feels pretty good. ;) 




 Very very true. But I don't feel too bad for losing, compared to how many mods he has. 




 It was a good race, we trash talked for a good week before the race. It came down to the wire, but he pulled a tad bit. :P 115.88 a stock motor isn't bad in my book. I just need to work on launching. 




 [Video of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZbYlPzafk) 









 I think it's a bot. Idek. 




 [Basically r/Mustang and r/NewEdgeMustang..](http://2015-ford-mustang.tumblr.com/page/10) 




 lol @ the person downvoting everyone. 




 I hate when people don't go with reputable exhausts, cause that shit can sound either good, or dog shit. I looked at so many catbacks before getting ATAKs, I was considering Flows or Magnas, but Borla just suits it.
I got mine from CJ Pony Parts, But both AM and CJ hiked the ATAK price up.. :( 847$ is a bit much. 800$ is O.K. I have a discount from a Mustang Club I'm in, so I got it for 760$. 




 [Heres the first ever start-up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDQGhuYuEpk) 




 I didn't really notice any difference from inside the cabin, besides when I accelerate.. ;) I would recommend ATAKs to anyone who can get their hands on them. 




 This is true! I had heard that people said ATAKs on a 2v were too high pitched, but this is perfect. 




 ;D 




 Thanks man, Definitely turns a few heads now! 














 I promise it will. That bumper though.  




 Good. I'm glad. Cringe man. Cringe like you you've never cringed before. 




 I can't put it on until HOPEFULLY this weekend. So I thought, might as well do dumb shit with it. So yes, I hit make a sexy pose with it. I made my brother take the photo, please help me. And of course I'll post a sound clip. I'm so excited! 




 Brb, stripping my interior! 




 No one needs to talk man! Talking is over-rated. lmao. 




 * Can we g--- **BRWAAAAHHHH!!!**
What?
* I said, Can w--- **BRWAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!**
I'm sorry, what?
* Ca--- **BRWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!**
Fuck it!


Thats literally going to be my car now.
And I'm fucking excited. 




 Ayyyye lmao 




 I got mine from StangMods! 









 Give me the front bumper, and I'll buy you a steak dinner.
