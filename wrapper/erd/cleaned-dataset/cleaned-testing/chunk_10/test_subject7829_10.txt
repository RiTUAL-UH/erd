 Lorber was criticized for never publishing these findings in a peer-reviewed journal though. I would be a bit skeptical about his claims.  









 With the exception of 1976 and the three-party elections of the Bill Clinton Era, when the Democratic share of the vote actually went down, but Clinton won some Southern states due to Perot, the GOP swept the field in the South after 1964. The democratic share of the congressional delegations from the south more gradually deteriorated as incumbents held on, often by becoming Republicans in all but name (Zell Miller comes to mind.)

The whole discussion is confused by the fact that the political parties were not as ideologically aligned back then as they are now. There were plenty of Republicans more liberal than most Southern Democrats.  




 Those links show exactly the trend I was talking about... there was clearly a shift in the Republican attitude towards Civil Rights after Goldwater won the nomination in '64 and then with Nixon's Southern Strategy (yes, 5 deep southern states went for Wallace, but the rest went for Nixon.) 




 The racist white southerners voted for Democrats locally and at the State level but GOP at the national level? For Senators and Congressmen?

Correct. That voting pattern persisted for decades and is well-documented.

30 out of 32 GOP Senators voted for the CRA.

What CRA are you talking about? The Community Reinvestment Act?

Why would racist white southerners vote for Democrats locally who didn't push civil rights but a national GOP that did?

Because the GOP was to the right of the Democrats on Civil Rights on a national level after 1964. Goldwater and Nixon were seen as being more sympathetic to Southern white "interests" than LBJ and Humphrey. 

P.S. LBJ was a southern Democrat

So was Al Gore. Politics is strange.
 




 Because Civil Rights wasn't pushed at the state level by Southern Democrats, inertia and incumbency kept many of them in office for decades. 




  1) The Republican party lost the the black American vote over civil rights in the 60's. 

More accurately, the Democratic Party lost the *white* Southern vote in the 60's due to Civil Rights, then the GOP lost the black vote as they swept in to pick up those voters. At the time, the Republicans were trading a smaller voting bloc for a bigger one. Smart politics. At the time. But karma's a bitch. 









 Not necessarily. To be regarded as scientifically valid, a phenomenon needs to be replicable. Most reports of "supernatural" phenomena indicate an unpredictable and sporadic pattern of occurrence. A person might claim to experience precognition, or see a "ghost" once or twice in a lifetime. This could very well be because such phenomena do not in fact exist, and are the result of malfunctioning brains or sense organs, but if they do exist, this unpredictable pattern could be why they have never been scientifically proven.

Another thing to consider is the relationship between subjective states and physical objects. Some subjective states (for example, seeing the color red) have a physical correlate (an object that emits light in the red wavelengths). These states can thus be studied by science in an indirect manner since their causes are known, even if the exact relationship between the object and the subjective state it engenders is still a matter of fierce debate.

However, if there are subjective states that *do not* have a physical correlate, than these states might forever be outside the realm of scientific examination. Examples might include mystical experiences, the feeling of subtle energies such as chi or prana, etc.

Science can certainly observe the brainwaves of people who claim to be experiencing such states, but that is different from directly studying the (potentially supernatural) *object* that could be engendering these states. Note how this is unlike studying a brain that is seeing a color red, where the object emitting the light can be directly observed.

None of this proves anything about the actual existence of the supernatural of course, it merely casts doubts on those who believe that science itself is an "all-seeing eye" with a truly universal method for obtaining knowledge.

I think these considerations answer your second question as well: Science has no choice but to assume that only naturalistic phenomena are at work because its method can see nothing else.  



















 "Actually collect taxes" would be good, but it's difficult. There is actually a clause in the Greek constitution preventing the taxing of shipping. Guess what the biggest industry in Greece is? Therefore Greece relies heavily on sales taxes, and even taxes on utility bills, which fall most heavily on the poor.

Some labor market reforms are called for, but severely cutting the pensions of people who are already retired, and often supporting multiple unemployed adult offspring, will only be counterproductive. 




 "Reforms" that would privatize major public assets and hand them over to the same banks that defrauded the Greek people (and the EU) to get them in to the Euro in the first place. I wouldn't have stomach for that either.

 That happened to me once, but it was during hypnogogia not SP (which I've never had.) It was a really complex classical music piece that I didn't remember ever hearing before. I still wonder where it came from and how it just happened to pop into my head.

So that Mississippi, or some sort of neo-Confederacy more likely, does not have independent control of nuclear weapons and leaders with End Times belief systems.

  They used their own stock as collateral for bank loans. Jesus Christ.

That practice is not limited to China... 




 I think you're on to something here. The Chinese leadership might be evil, but they don't have a track record of this kind of blatant stupidity. 

This is the first explanation of this move that I've seen that even halfway makes sense, and that manipulation is documented already in the case of Hanergy, where the CEO was borrowing from shady shell companies he controlled so he could buy more of his own stock every time the price threatened to go down. It wouldn't surprise me if this scam was a lot more widespread than has been reported.
 



















 I used to do this as a kid - nothing mysterious about it though. Kids are very light and nimble: I would "jump" off the top step and just kind of hop down, barely touching the outside edge of every step on the way. It felt like I was gliding down on an escalator.

One time it went wrong and I rolled my ankle.

 If you have a deposit in a bank, you are a creditor of that bank. If the bank cannot meet its obligations, expect to lose part of your investment (unless it is insured.) Bank accounts are NOT cash that is being "held" somewhere. 




 Never knew this had a name. Pretty cool. Also pretty cool to see a mainstream media outlet discussing the paranormal without the usual sneering dismissal. My wife experienced one of these when her grandmother passed away. Not conclusive proof of anything in my book, but certainly something that warrants further investigation. Unfortunately the scientific method is not geared to look into sporadic phenomena such as this. 




 It's a shame because they were ahead of the curve on a lot of issues, but they ruin all their credibility with juvenile posts and over-the-top "the world is ending" stuff. I'm not sure if there is any editorial control at ZH at all - there doesn't seem to be. 




 The Yoga Sutras are old enough (c. 400 AD) to qualify as "ancient" by most people's definition of the word, and they draw upon an obviously older tradition. The 84 classic poses, some of which you will learn in an intro class, have been codified for well over 1,000 years.

A lot of the "fad" yogas ("hot" yoga, dog yoga for chrissakes) are recent inventions, but yoga itself is a very old tradition. This idea that yoga is some modern invention is just [intellectual hipsterism](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2pv/intellectual_hipsters_and_metacontrarianism/). 




 That "treatment" was used in the past and failed, most famously on an unwilling Alan Turing. Gays have normal levels of testosterone, etc.  




 If there ever is a way to "simulate" minds from the past, I'm sure his would be one of the first one the list. 




 There is some speculation (and it is only speculation), that GID might be tied to long-term use of drugs that influence hormone pathways, including steroids. In addition to Jenner who everyone's talking about, I remember a Navy SEAL and a champion mountain climber being in the news recently for going from super-"macho" men to wanting to become women. Anecdotal evidence to be sure, but interesting nonetheless. 




 It is also that many priests in the past tended to be closeted homosexuals who joined the clergy so no one would question why they remained unmarried. If they chose to act on their desires at all, often the only available (and vulnerable) population was underage boys. 

Technically that is "homosexual predation" rather than "classical" pedophilia, but you will never hear right-wingers mention the context surrounding it. Instead they want you to think that gays are inherently predatory regardless of their social circumstances.  




 I was at a Law School graduation recently, and people were whooping and hollering worse than any High School graduation I've been to. Bet none of them got served with warrants. 




 Only the "Dark Knight" movie itself was, the other two movies in the Trilogy were so-so (the first one) and awful (the third.) 




 I thought the originals were far better. I agree the implied back-story was done well, but the guitar dude turned the whole thing into camp, which the original two films certainly were not (Thunderdome had some Return of the Jedi-esque forshadowing to Fury Road's corniness.) 



















 We still have never figured out how he knew. 

License plate scanners were just coming into use around that time, he could have had access to that. Now, if a cop pulls you over, he can see exactly where you've been unless you've been out in the middle of nowhere. There could have been a scanner at the concert to look for drug activity.  




 ...and since he "died" before his sentencing, his family got to keep all of his ill-gotten gains. I would look in the Caribbean or Switzerland before assuming he's got a cottage up there with Jeb.

On the other hand, his second-in-command Skilling who seemed the smarter of the two actually did some serious jail time, so he probably really did die of a heart attack from the stress of the trial. Nice plot arc for a soap opera though. 




 Yep. The ones with a nice, predictable "twist" at the end immediately arouse my skepticism. This one, if it is is fake, is an incredibly unique and chilling story that doesn't give off the "spooky movie" vibe. I can't believe it didn't get more upvotes. 









 Good point - I should have said objects that can be satisfactorily approximated by spheres.  




 It means that we can't think of infinite sets as "menus" where you can freely pick an element like we can with finite sets. Some go further and say that the whole idea of infinite sets is incoherent. 

My position is that infinite sets are good approximations of things that are very large but in reality finite. We can "use" infinite sets in applied mathematics with little reservation, but we should not take them "literally" as representations of physical objects like spheres. 









 Depends on the state. In my state it is not required and there is one (wealthy) district nearby that does not provide bus service - parents are expected to carpool (or hire a taxi/towncar). 




 Dialed in? Locked in? 









 Whoops, sorry, forgot to actually link to the article! 




 I've read a good deal of Hegel and he would probably say something quite similar to your explanation. Now that you've expounded more on your point I can say I agree. 




   This is barely relevant, 

You are too modest sir...

yet "something" would be similarly empty--it would be merely static existence.

Good post and I agree with 95% of what you wrote, but I think we need to explore this statement a little more - why would an "absolute" something be static? 
 




 Quantum physics shows that vacuum states are unstable, and while this is very interesting, it doesn't tell us why there is something rather than nothing, and if we feign that it does by defining "nothing" as vacuum states, or something like this, then we're guilty of a fallacy of equivocation.

Good point, and actually one I've made elsewhere, pointing out that Leonard Krauss commits this fallacy. To clear up what I meant, QM "nothing" is obviously not an *absolute* "nothing" with no laws, no physical objects, etc., but the fact that the state as close as you can get to "nothingness" within that system is unstable is suggestive of the theory that "nothingness" within *any* system, even a necessarily true one like formal logic, is also unstable. Not a proof of this assertion by any means, but suggestive none the less.

How can something be both necessarily true and contradictory, i.e. necessarily false? 

Logic is necessarily true, but it's not necessarily contradictory. It's only contradictory if we allow it to refer only to itself. 

Also, why should not having "a final referent to something that's not a logical statement" make a logical statement contradictory?

If logical statements refer only to themselves, eventually they will form a self-referential loop with all the self-reference paradoxes arising. Many attempts to axiomatize logic put limits on logical self-reference, but this requires a ultimate "ground" or referrent that is not itself a logical statement.

But if we re-frame consciousness as being primarily about choice...
Then we're just changing the subject.

I think there's a connection - [see my reply to OP here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/32kp1i/the_connection_between_the_origin_of_matter_and/cqcxfj9). 




 I'm having a hard time conceiving of what you mean from a hard materialist position. Do you have anything else you could say about it?

It's hard to stay a "hard materialist" once you start contemplating these questions, in my opinion. Basically there needs to be some sort of free agent to make the primordial choice for what exists. It doesn't follow that this is a conventional "God" in any sense, however. It could be more like Schopenhauer's Will. 

I'm not familiar with these, what are they? I can also look it up myself of course but I'd love to hear your thoughts if you don't mind. 

The multiverse theory holds that this not the only Universe, there are other Universes out there, perhaps with their own laws of physics, etc.

As for the paradoxes of the actual infinite, you can start with Hilbert's Hotel or the fact that the infinite sum of the series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 +.... actually equals negative 1 if we assume you can actually do "infinite sums" instead of treating them as approximations of very large but finite operations.  




 I've recently realized that "why is there something rather than nothing?" is actually the *easy* question of fundamental ontogeny. While scientists and philosophers don't have an exact answer yet, it is obvious that somehow "nothingness" is unstable/impossible, as seen in Quantum Physics.

My own personal preference is for the theory is that formal logic is necessarily true, but also contradictory if it doesn't have a final referent to something that's not a logical statement (that is, a material object or something like it rather than an abstraction like a rule of logic.) This creates a need for a "necessary object."

So if what was called the Ultimate Question is really the easy question, then what's the hard question? It has to be why *this particular* something, rather than any of the other possibilities that might have served as adequate necessary objects.

Even if we live as part of a "multiverse," this doesn't solve the problem, as there can be only a finite number of universes, or else all the logical contradictions of Actual Infinities would arise.

What does any of this have to do with consciousness? Not too much, if we define consciousness in terms of awareness, qualia, etc. But if we re-frame consciousness as being primarily about *choice*, with those other qualities emerging later as consequences, then I think we're on to something. 




 Awesome reply, thanks, that's what I was looking for. 




 Thanks for the reply. I think my question is a little more philosophical. If there is no "master clock" for the Universe, then how can we say that the Universe as a whole has an age? Is 13.7 billion years just the age as it appears to us because of our "position" in spacetime, or is it somehow an absolute age?

 Probably the case. Most likely the boat was happened upon in open waters by a Chinese vessel that was fishing illegally in the area. Because they were poaching, the Chinese crew did not report finding a body, but they still gave it a proper burial in their custom, and even thought to leave the jawbone above ground for easy dental identification.

 How is it guaranteed that such a function exists? He says that all predicates have a fixed point like this but he doesn't really go into it. I found that confusing because among ordinary "mathematical" functions, not all of them have fixed points. 




 I am trying to make my way through Yanofsky's "Outer Limits of Reason" and I am on the section about the Incompleteness Theorems. I was following his argument pretty well until it got to the following:

He defines a predicate as a function that takes a number as an input and gives a logical value (true or false) as its output.

He then defines a fixed point of a predicate F(x) as a logical statement C such that F("C")=C, where "C" is the Gdel Number of C.

It appears that our predicate F(x) now outputs a logical *statement* instead of a logical *value*. Am I missing something here or is the author being sloppy in his explanation?

(This is all on p. 320 - 322 if you want to do a Google Book search.) 




 What type of argument does he make for that assertion? I can think of so much evidence against it: Optical illusions, the scientific evidence that qualia (whatever they are) vary between individuals who speak different languages, etc. 




 I don't think that Rupert Sheldrake accepts the reality of physical objects at all, but I'm not sure. I don't know much about his work other than the controversial "dogs know when you're coming home" stuff, unless you're referring to a different Sheldrake. 




 Actually I have immediate mental images for all of those, but even if we accept that point, do reports of qualia seem to be referring to functional roles, or to images? 




 Seems most likely to me that any solution would involve tapping "dark energy" directly, if it exists. It is speculation to be sure but it's never too early to get started on a problem this big! 




 Summary:
Although psychedelics can induce temporary confusion and emotional turmoil, hospitalizations and serious injuries are extremely rare. Overall psychedelics are not particularly dangerous when compared with other common activities, says Krebs. 









 I don't think this representation would arise without an actual sensation behind it. Representations can refer to "imaginary" objects, but I don't see how they can refer to things that are not even subjectively real. I can't talk about pink unicorns without actual mental images behind those words, even though there are no such things in physical reality. Even contradictions like "square circles" refer to actual sensations, although each term is distinct from the other. 




 Then G still exists as a semblance. Since qualia are nothing but semblances or appearances anyway, G exists as a quale. 









 Penrose Triangles don't exist as physical objects, but they do exist as sensations. No one is claiming that qualia are anything but sensations. Anything that "resembles" a quale is a quale, since it is nothing but a sensation anyway. 




 If qualia don't exist as subjective phenomena, why do we have a name for them? It is hard to see how the concept of qualia arose if there aren't any. 




 Dismissing qualia as an "illusion" doesn't really help solve the problem. Everyone accepts that qualia are illusions in some sense in that they are not inherent in physical objects. The question is why this type of "illusion" arises and is perceived. 




 They can't even stamp out marijuana after 70 years, what hope do they have versus something like ayahuasca? A crackdown would only help to make it more famous.

 ... and now someone has the opportunity to coin a word that describes the coining of a word that describes itself. 
























 Pick any number. Let's use 30:

2 is a factor of 30. But the next number after 30 that's a multiple of 2 is 32...

3 is a factor of 30 too. But the next number after 30 that's a multiple of 3 is 33...

...and so on.

See what happens? Poor old 31 is always left out. It can't ever share any factors with 30 (other than 1 of course.)

As for a formal proof, take any whole number "x" such that x1 and x is a factor of n. 

Since x is a factor of "n", then n/x is a whole number. 

But what about (n+1)? Well, for "n+1" to have "x" as a factor (n+1)/x would have to be a whole number. But distributing the division in the previous statement yields n/x+1/x. 

We already showed that n/x is a whole number, and 1/x is obviously not a whole number (since x1), and a whole number plus a non-whole number is never a whole number.
