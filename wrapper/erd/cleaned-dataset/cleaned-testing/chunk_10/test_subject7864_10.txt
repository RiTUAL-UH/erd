 I'd do a lot of the same things I'd do with a duck, it being a fatty bird. The last time I cooked through an entire duck I cooked the following:

Rendered Duck Fat (to make anything you'd need fat in--eggs, biscuits, etc)
Duck Confit (shred off the bone + add to whatever--you can even make nuggets :) or a shepards pie style dish )
Pate
Broth 




 RESPECT 




 it was the richest thing I've ever made/consumed 









 Basically a snicker doodle with way more cinnamon! 









 Thank you kindly! I love music and lived in Seattle a spell so sub pop is close to my heart.  




 HAHA that is incredible. You're my internet hero. 




 I made a pork shoulder mix with lots of pork broth, sage, rosemary and a hit of nutmeg. Super fatty and delicious. 














 I try my best! 









 OMG twins! you're making the souffl Gotham deserves but not the one it needs right now.
