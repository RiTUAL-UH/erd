 Yeah--that part seemed a bit over the top. 









 What a frickin' moron.  Was this technician of an Indian ethnicity? 




 The first G. Love song I ever heard back in 7th grade. 




 True 'dat! 




 This makes for great, by-myself, working-late-at-work music.

I'm blaring it, and jamming out, man! 









 Ah, my apologies.  I will redact my post.  I saw the image, and assumed it was the same animated GIF that's been re-posted about 100 times the past week or so.

I will also downvote my original comment, and upvote your post in apology.  I'm man enough to admit I was wrong. 




 That has to be staged.  Please tell me that's staged. 




 [Redacted] 




 With the layout you have, it's doable. 




 LMAO!

 Haha--I remember this from when Windows actually LOOKED like that... Damn, I'm old. 




 Only thing I might do differently is not have ANY defenses touching each other (e.g., cannons and flamethrowers, M.G. and flamethrower, etc.). 




 I'm so jealous of the shock.  I wantssss one, Precioussss. 




 I wouldn't know how to attack that.  I might steal it... although I'm only level 42. 




 Is she on meth or something?  Dear God. 




 'em... not 'um... 




 I'm sorry, but I laughed out loud at this one. 




 Great dance to a great song.

This is one of my favorite ElectroSwing songs. 




 I was about to reply, "That's not from the sewers, that's electrical conduit," when BLAMMO!

Dear God! 









 Eeeeexcellent. 




 Okay, I'm not into dancing, but that was pretty badass. 




 I remember being 12 when this came out, and seeing it on MTV.

HAHA! 




 Yeah, people don't like seeing the ugly truth behind abortion. 




 AND while wearing a corset! Impressive! 




 Doesn't mean that he was the man the Many-Faced God wanted killed. 




 The cheating insurance merchant. 




 Soul Calibur V will have her in purple pasties. 




 That's a pretty cool idea actually. 




 No, it isn't.  It clearly says $7.**01** 




 So mean!  Haha!  He probably needs a new pair of pants now. 




 A cash reward?  Seriously?  Yes, you did what any decent person would have done.  They gave you a free meal and a $100 gift card.

Do you deserve an apology?  Yes.  A cash reward?  No. 




 Holy nostalgia, Batman!

I was 12 when this came out, and I remember watching it.  HAHA! 




 The beginning opera part was; the upbeat part was digitally altered to make it sound more "alien". 




 Has he not heard of the S.E.T.I. program that has been running for decades? 




 And you look jailbaitish... 




 Morning poop while browsing Reddit.

Walk my 2 miles while listening to audio book.

Shower and get dressed.

Go to work. 




 Having a power surge is the issue. Doesn't matter if they are on or not. If you have a massive surge, only unplugging all your devices will keep them safe.

Most residential loadcenters are not equipped with surge-protection devices, and the store-bought surge protectors are only rated for so many amps of surge. 




 If she doesn't want to hear stomping in her apartment, she should make sure to be on the top floor. Stupid ho. 




 I have a ton of family images and videos on my PC running Windows 7. Do I need to do anything with all of them when I upgrade to Windows 10?

Should I get a USB harddrive to store them on just in case? Move them to a non-Windows-related folder on C:\? Will windows automatically import them?

Help!

Great animation. 




 For not being digitally altered like the film, that was incredible. 




 Because photography sucked, and everything was washed out. 




 Wait--Fox News has a Latino website? 




 Linked to the vid before I could. 




 Yeah, because a group of 50 represents a vast cross-section of Americans....... 




 Ha! That's awesome! 




 This is getting fucking ridiculous! 




 Welcome to the Republican party. 




 The same. Kids just added even MORE mess. 




 Vault level is on original post.

I'll edit my base around, and try this one. Thanks! 




 Let her go.l, dude. Long distance relationships never work. Ever. 




 I absolutely LOVE that speech from The Dictator. 




 Already do this. They go through dirty stuff and wash what they need when they need it. I do my full laundry on the same day every weekend. 




 Hehehe 




 /u/Bodwire , I made this based upon your description.

Version #1 - http://i.imgur.com/pegKwET.jpg

Version #2 - http://i.imgur.com/CB5kkG6.jpg

Is that you had in mind? 




 I've been too long with 5 people in the house, I suppose. Haha! 




 I base mine of the tax and the service:

Poor service = 1.0xTax = 9.0%

Good service = 1.5xTax = 13.5%

Great service = 2.0xTax = 18.0% 




 Awesome reply. Thanks! 




 This made me and my wife laugh pretty damn hard.  A must-see for young men. 




 Wife and step-daughter lived with my in-laws. 




 No, I expect them to pick up their toys at the end of every day, and to put their dirty clothes in the hamper. 









 Internets brofist. 




 Edit: Working peoples' tax dollars... and most working people don't qualify for "free" government anything. 




 "I'm just tired by the end of the day..."

"I just forget..."

etc.

All to which I reply, "I'm tired too, but it has to be done." 




 Divorce isn't an option.  Especially over something as trivial as a clean house. 




 My booms then launchers get taken out... but I'll try.

Switch the booms with the inner machine guns, or the one-row-up ones? 




 I've mentioned how I can't relax in a dirty house.  Again, no comment.  Yeah--we need to talk... won't be pretty. 




 She is #5 of 6, and they grew up with a woman who cleaned and started supper before she left.

I was raised to clean my own crap. I was doing my own laundry by 7 or 8. More was expected of us, I suppose. 




 http://wall4all.me/thumbs/games/bro-fist-1109995-480x320.png 




 I guess what I meant is that cleaning is part of being a parent to me.

But I got what ya mean. 




 I miss Bozo... 




 Holy shit--that was amazing.  HAHA! 




 Some nights when no one feels like cooking, we'll have F.F.Y. (fend for yourself) nights.  Except the kids, we give them cereal or something really easy. 




 We tried that too.  She made fish sticks and mac and cheese every week for her meal because "that's all I know how to make".

We tried telling her to look for recipes and try new ones... that's what adults do.  No go. 




 Oh, please, it's not as if Netflix customers ASKED for them to make their own shows.  They did it strictly for revenue. 




 Except for Apocalypse. 




 So hard to have that conversation without being accusatory. 




 Upgrading armory is so damn expensive... as is upgrading troops and whatnot. 




 By the time she gets home, feeds the kids, bathes the kids, and gets them in bed, she "doesn't feel like doing anything".

I, on the other hand, when in the same place will include cleaning up my crap before I veg out and watch television.

She has friends.  She definitely has a supportive husband.  She might be depressed due to me not being around a lot.  Work has gotten crazy lately. 




 How do I have such a conversation without coming across as if I'm saying, "You're lazy, and you're teaching the kids lazy behavior by being that way"? 




 We both work to pay for private school tuitions (public schools suck here).

The teenager doesn't give a crap about money surprisingly.  If she doesn't have it, she has an "oh, well" attitude about it.  Totally annoying. 




 $300/month for food is low unless you love eating ramen or beans and rice.

Typically, housing should be 25% of your budget.  Right now, your rent estimate is 34%.  It's manageable if you make a budget per month and stick with it.

Okay, not sure where you are (and what the standard cost of living is), but in Baton Rouge, LA (where I live) your situation is totally doable. 




 Yes.  I've even said, "Y'all have GOT to help me clean.  I'm not doing it all by myself."

That gets them to help some.  But I end up doing 60-70% of it on my own... and I'm one of five people in the house. 




 I make passive-aggressive/guilt-trip statements like, "Man, y'all are messy," "Hey, it'd be awesome if you cleaned," etc.

I even asked my wife this evening (after taking kids home to the dirty house and going back to work for the second part of my day) what she did all day.  "I dunno--hung out.  Why?"  I replied, "I dunno... just thought you'd clean up some or something..."  I got no reply. 




 My problem is that I'm not the one home to get them to clean up after themselves.  I can get them to clean on the weekends SOME, but if my wife would step up and help, it'd be awesome. 









 My wife of 5.5 years and I have a 15yo (step-daughter), 4yo son, and 3yo daughter. I work long hours on weekdays: in by 7:30AM, home by 9:00PM or later. I come home, and there is crap everywhere. It builds and builds until the weekend comes.

I can't relax in a messy house. Dishes (sometimes still with food) in sink, trash all over counters, toys everywhere, etc. I end up cleaning on the weekends because I can't stand it. I make the kids clean their crap (whining about how much it is), ask my wife to help (as she's playing Candy-effing-Crush or Face-effing-book) clean.

Why can't they just clean up their own crap? I spend time cleaning up a house that had literally NO messes made by me. I tried the don't-do-anything-until-they-do-it-themselves trick. That backfired miserably. I had TWO weeks of crap to do.

Case in point: my wife stayed home today with the 15yo who is recovering from a tonsillectomy. I brought the 3yo and 4yo to a sitter. I had hoped she would've cleaned the house, done laundry, done frickin' SOMEthing. NOPE. It eas even MORE messy than when I left this morning. What the hell can I do?

tl;dr - Wife and kids are lazy as hell; they won't clean up; husband/dad does everything after working 14+ work days all week. 




 Either trust her, and let it all go; or don't trust her, and let HER go. 




 So... what are you asking? 




 You probably won't.  Do yourself a favor, and block her. 




 Questions:

1. How old are you and your SO?
2. How long have you been dating?
3. What type of job do you both have?  Is it stable?
4. Are you taking into account the utility deposits (i.e., electricity, water, cable, internet, etc.)?

 What is the seventh word of the original poster's question? 




 [Link saw this as well.](http://i.imgur.com/NK2j0sn.jpg) 




 Having experienced this myself (being in a magnet program in a school shared with inner-city kids), I would 100% believe you. 




 Ah, the power of Google:

 That's some damn good conduit routing.  Wow. 




 That's friggin' crazy.  Probably tastes crappy though. 




 A pink one.  Glad I could help! 




 He didn't even inquire as to her well-being at the end.

What a dick. 




 "Someone's gotta pay for all of our overly-expensive, Netflix shows!" 




 Dayum.  I've seen the second half before, but never the first half.

Pretty damn cool!  No special effects there! 




 ...yeah, I'm glad this never happened. 




 ...it keeps it from growing 3-feet long... 




 Hope they have less rap than the last album.  









 If only they really existed. 




 If only she had a larger chest... 




 Hi, welcome to Reddit about 12 hours ago. 




 Agreed--her audition was crap. 




 No, you aren't alone.  I think everyone I know thinks it means crying tears as opposed to ripping tears. 




 Helen Hunt was more believable than Laura Dern from just that short clip. 




 65 wpm for me.

Cool little site.  Thanks for the link!
