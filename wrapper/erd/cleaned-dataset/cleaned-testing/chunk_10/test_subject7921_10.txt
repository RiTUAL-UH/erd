 AFAIK they only test thyroid before some specific age if  you have a family history and if you complain about symptoms associated with it.  But been about a decade since I heard that, so rule of thumb may have changed.
 




 Any recent blood work to check for something being off or borderline?  Or family history of anything in particular?

My family had thyroid issues, it kinda came on pretty quick for me.  Blood tests were fine for years, then I was hypo.

What makes it hard is that having sleep apnea basically gives you a lot of the symptoms for other conditions.  Feeling tired, depressed, etc.   Also something interesting to note, like half of sleep apnea patients also have diabetes.  The correlation between them became strong enough that the local hospital paired it's sleep center and diabetes center together.
 




 Have you had your medications evaluated?   Some of them make it worse.

Also after I had a medication change my sleep apnea improved, I suspect it was thyroid medication related, but I also had a diabetic medication change about the same time.  I dropped like 4-5 in pressure from one or both of those medications.

Might not help, but never hurts to throw it out there and see if there's the possibility.

 




 Maaaaybe. 




 *drool* 




 Uhhh, maybe he's afraid of his friends trying to steal you away.  Dinner plates always meant nipple size being extremely large on the boob.  Not seeing that here, you have nice proportions.
 




 Im concerned Ill be alone forever.  Oh and Im allergic to shitloads of stuff outside and mildly allergic to bananas.  But Im OK with the banana thing, I think guys look silly eating them.
 




 Requesting more, with less hands.
 




 Oh and one of the reviews about these places said that the people trying to recruit you make a "bonus" or some sort of rate for suckering people into it.

So you can pretty much guarantee they will be bullshitting you.
 




 Closer mirror with better lighting.   You're too attractive to hide back there.  




 I only understood about half of what was going on in that.
 




 Oh it's eats my soul up not having had a girlfriend, etc.  And I just read a post about how the guy was seen as a pariah until his "hot" girlfriend showed up to meet him for lunch.  

That made me wonder if that's why people treat me oddly.

That's the thread I was referring to.

 




 If you were gay you could at least say they were being discriminatory toward you because of it.

If you just had an ugly girlfriend, you'd still be in the same boat. 




 Your 20s?  Im 36, same boat.

The less you care about it at your age, the more likely it is to happen.  Weird phenomenon, no idea why it's attractive to women.
 




 Must be interesting on St Patty's Day. 




 Wondering if that green shirt is your "boobs out" shirt.
 




 I found this to be pretty good information.  My main issue is just trying to feel like I'm worth doing anything positive for.  And the fear of having things go really sideways and being worse off than I am.

It's a lot of ........mental barriers/blocks and/or fear driven logic in my case.  Reinforced by years of history that supports that I'm not worth it (in my mind at least).

But this post is helpful, if you want to post more in comments or send me some things that you find helpful I'd be receptive.  Can't guarantee I'll enact them, but I am always looking for things that "click".
 




 Had a number of "Sales" people contact me from Monster.  If you actually look into them you'll find you work on commission and that most people don't make much if anything at the job for months and months.

Probably a complete waste of time to contact them.
 




 More accurate perhaps, but not perfect.

It still doesn't cover things like stress, exercise, if you are sick, what you ate.  All things that have to be recorded and detailed by the people wearing them and a lot of that is perception based.

Then you have water intake......other conditions you may have, does the equipment interfere with things you may do regularly?


My thinking on it is, that it's so varied that we need genetic level testing and tracking so that medication/diet can be weighed against the genetics at play.  

Won't happen due to cost, but that's my idea of perfect data.  It really goes down to figuring out what works for you and hoping your doctor isn't set in the mindset of "The guidelines say this, so we must do this"
 




 What are you writing?
 




 Not hard, but if you are worried about your window falling apart you could always build a little wooden box around the AC unit to spread the contact weight to the box instead of the sill and closed window.

They are very easy to install, but heavier than a fan.  If your house is kinda old or has a poor electrical wiring job it might flip the breakers when the compressor kicks on if it shares a circuit with anything major.

You want to buy something big enough to cool the room you're putting it in.  Otherwise you'll have issues with it.  I had a frigidaire unit for about 4-5 years now, remove it during winter and clean it before putting it back in every year.  Not the GREATEST fit with the window in terms of blocking the heat leaking in around it, but it gets the job done.

 




 Agreeing with this.  Depression basically sucks the positive feelings right out of you, you can be numb/neutral/bored/"fine"....  

And you tend to forget all the good feelings associated with past things.
 




 According to some diabetes classes I've been to, they have revised their guidelines in the last few years and have data showing that it may still be "incorrect".

Even WHEN you exercise can affect your results.  

Personally I think they are guessing at it a lot of times because there's just no way they can get perfect information from all people with diabetes.
 




 Normal primary physicians likely aren't willing/able to deal with it unless it's just a straight up medication change/adjustment/addition.

So be prepared to be referred elsewhere. 




 Sexy, cute, adorable.  First picture is probably my favorite.
 




 Very hot. 




 It wasn't unissued, they just only run them for so long.   Humble bundle site is just a really good site to keep an eye on anyway....various game/book/comic book, etc bundles.
 




 Yeah, these pictures keep getting better and more interesting.    The creativity really stands out.
 




 I dont know the age you're dealing with here.  But even as an adult I think I would appreciate someone buying me a pi with the breadboard stuff and a book on ideas/things to do with it.  

Something I wanna do when time/money/etc works out.  They recently had these "maker" books on humble bundle, it had a pi book and some other things in it that were interesting to browse.  Unfortunately that bundle sale is now over, but it might give you some ideas.
 




 And really nice hair.
