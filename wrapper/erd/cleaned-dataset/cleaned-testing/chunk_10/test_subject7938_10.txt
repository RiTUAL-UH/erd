Sort of silly, but it's such a perfect illustration of the bulk of anti-GMO folks. "I fundamentally lack understanding of modern agriculture and genetics, but I'm against it."

FAQ:

Q: How do I register?
A: Use Paypal to send money to dcdiamond (at) gmail.com or pay cash in person before the run on Saturday. Please include your hash name in your registration message.

Q: What do I get with my Rego?
A: Drunk. And if you have the presence of mind to give me your hash name, a personalized tag.

Q: What does a VIP get?
A: One of our talented artiste-hashers will write VIP on you somewhere in permanent marker. Its entirely possible this will happen whether you pay for the VIP rego or not. Other than that, you get to feel good about giving money to charity and you can lord it over your fellow wankers. 














 That's an interesting point, and yes I could. I should work that out for next launch.  




 Cool! I have looked at The Apollo67 website. This was just a first go, so we used cell phones. Plans are already under way for an APRS beacon. 




 No, the camera was outside a styrofoam cooler. The more important parts were inside with a hand warmer. Even still, it got to -10C inside the cooler. Without the insulation, and the fact that chemical handwarmers will not work at altitude (they require oxygen), it wouldn't stand a chance. Though it might have given us a few thousand more feet.

Things to engineer for next time! 




 Our primary tracking system used a [TK-102 GPS/GSM tracker](http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/161578074970?lpid=82 chn=ps). It works by texting GPS coordinates when pinged. Although, there is no cell reception above 15-20,000 feet, so for most of the flight we were in the dark.

It landed in a soybean field a little east of Stoughton. It was very close to out predicted landing.  




 On Monday a small student group in the physics department sent up a helium high altitude balloon. This is one photo we recovered. It's a little blurry because the payload is nowhere near stable.

This photo is from about 20,000 feet. The camera continued to collect images until the battery froze at about 33,000 feet. The balloon continued to 95,000 feet (18 miles!) before the balloon burst. Total flight time of about 2.5 hours. 









 The ice only exists in certain regions, but the atmosphere mixes easily and is remarkably uniform for the size. It takes just about a year for, say, the molecules in a liter of gas in one place today to become evenly distributed around the globe. This has been measured with stable heavy isotopes and various nuclear disasters/explosions.

The ice has a resolution of about one year, since the snow fall that traps the gas pockets happens on a yearly cycle. It is a great and reasonably high resolution way to estimate global CO2 levels for the last 800,000 years (Maximum so far achieved for the EPICA program.) Sea sediments can go back as far as 200 million years with lower resolution than ice cores.

So how is it irrelevant? Facts are relevant to science and this is a fact. CO2 levels are higher now than ever in the last million years. There's good confidence to say that and a mountain of supporting evidence with well defined error bars. 



















 I've never heard that name before.

It's a variegated dwarf umbrella tree, [*Schefflera arboricola*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schefflera_arboricola) 




 Someone needs to join the Hash House Harriers. 




 It means the Van province of Turkey, but made me laugh. 














 Different carcinogens expose you to more risk than others. In this case, glyphosate was put into group 2A, a [list is available on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_2A_carcinogens). 

Other things on that list are long-term exposure to frying foods, working a night shift, hot mate, and UV light. There is also at least one antibiotic and one chemo drug.

So protect yourself, and most farmers know that. Life is a game of relative risks. 




 And a flat front tire. 




 I was diagnosed in 2009. That's about my story too. 9 months of downward spiral ending with an ambulance ride.

Cheers! 




 Me too! 




 You can try to find the [Lost City in the Arboretum](http://wikimapia.org/16619367/Lost-City-Forest-UW-Arboretum). An old development was abandonded and what was built became reclaimed by the forest.  









 [Bar mitts](http://barmitts.com/) are the best investment I've made for winter biking. But my hands freeze on the reg.

 



















 The fifth panel of the first comic in the funny pages shows to two people on the moon. In the background, the stars appear to show the constellation Cassiopeia.

This might be a coincidence, but it looks uncannily similar. I googled "Love cassiopeia" without anything that looks relevent. The photo for "cassiopeia" is 192, a stone stairway.

Edit: [photo](http://i.imgur.com/FxRtKF3.png) I had to rotate the image from my astronomy program so the star names are upsidedown. 




 I'm in Wisconsin too. There have been a number of "cow" references, and I'm wondering if it's just a reference to "bullshit".

Also, the Nogelty idea seems real high on the list of personal information/do not do. 




 The slap .45 logo has lines around it. Most lines (not all) can be translated as Morse code. Some can be translated in either direction (away or towards the "Slap .45" text).

My translation yielded:

MOKMNGNCNANUNKKCCKQKC

OR:

MOKMAAWKANANUNKKCCKQKC

Neither may be correct, since some can be broken into two letters. Neither sequence makes any sense in Ceaser decoding. Hope this helps! 




 I am in Madison (~40 min. from New Glarus). I also have only gotten days 2   3 so far, but I have a friend in town who has. My packs have been the same as everyone elses.
