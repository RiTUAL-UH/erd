 Not only far, but if they hit an updraft just right, they'll come flying straight up in the air and land on top of you.

 The birds out in the middle of the ocean are always cool to see, until one flies into the engine room.  We had this large, green/black sea bird fly on board our ship off the coast of China, and, because we didn't want it crapping on, landing on, or damaging the equipment in any way, I spent the good part of a day just trying to shoo the thing out of there.  However, on a 600 ft container ship the engine room was 4 stories tall with a ton of open space, so we ended up saying screw it and let it be.  Not sure whatever happened to that bird, but it wasn't seen again for the remainder of that voyage.  Hopefully it found its way out the same way it came in.   




 We ran into one of those fields over by Taiwan - probably my favorite moment out at sea so far. It was dark enough out where you could see most of the stars, and all around us were what looked like lanterns, small taiwanese shrimping boats all lit up for fishing. we were drinking this Chinese vodka that tasted like ever clear and playing darts in the galley. When we walked out to the stern to light up some cigars we'd bought ashore, the wake of the ship was lit up like fireworks. As the propellor hit the jellyfish, they'd flash in bursts and light up the wake behind us in a dull glow that stretched for miles behind us. 




 It depends on how calm the seas are.  Most of the trash I've seen has been floating 10, 20 feet beneath the surface.  It's out there, especially in the Pacific between California and Hawaii, and big time around China, but if the waves are rough enough, you may never know its there. 




 I was on an older, German-built ship from the time when shipping companies really catered to their sailors.  We had a 12' x 16' heated salt water pool on the 04 deck and crossing the North Atlantic in the wintertime, I would spend an hour a night just laying on the surface of that pool, steam rising from it into the 20 degree air above, and just look across the sky and see it lit up with more stars than you could ever see from the most isolated place on land. 




 Those scientists better keep working on that whale deterrent tech, especially to get them out of the way of container ships.  I don't want one getting stuck on our bow.  Can you imagine how much extra load that puts on an engine? 




 This does a real number on hard drives
