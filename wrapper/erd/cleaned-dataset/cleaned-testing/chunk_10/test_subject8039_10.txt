 When I read about the pictures, all I could think about was how some victims feel like they aren't good enough, or that they can't face their families or loved ones. But your explanation makes more sense now. 




 So tonight is the new moon. They will be going down the rabbit hole tonight. Keep them in your thoughts, everyone. 

Isiah, Holly, and Caleb, we are rooting for all of you. 




 Soooo......... Do we get another update? At least one explaining why you're immune to the mold and to Hadwell? 




 This is the only one that gives me pause. The use of the radio. Only because in GoF, Hermione explains that there is too much magic around Hogwarts, and it would interfere with any sort of electronics. I'm pretty sure that the cameras they are using are older models that don't have any electronic parts. As to why they haven't incorporated any other Muggle tech into their world is because their homes would be too infused with magic (as similar to Hogwarts) and they would fry the electronics. The Hogwarts Express is a steam engine, one of the first trains invented, and therefore has no electronics. 

Hope this helps!! 




 They could've used the spell that either Crouch or Amos used in the beginning of the book as well. It would've shown them the last few spells Harry used, and then they would've seen that he didn't kill Cedric. 

Honestly, I think that even the Ministry couldn't find a way to justify Harry being the killer. They knew that if they did that, the rest of the Wizarding World would've known Harry was telling the truth, because he's the Boy Who Lived. 




 She's my girlfriend and she's a small part of the problem. I need to talk to her about it, and I will. I just don't want to .

As to why I don't want to exist, I couldn't tell you. Again, I'm not suicidal, I just don't want to be anymore. Like I just want to be empty. I already feel like a living shell of who I once was, and I wish I could say it was the first time. 

I laid in bed last night, and all I could think about was how I wanted to be anywhere but there. But then I thought about staying at my girlfriends place, and that thought was also unappealing (that one being a first, I've never not wanted to stay with her). So I started thinking about other places I could go to crash, and nothing sounded good. So I opted to stay in my own bed, but it just felt wrong. It didn't feel like the bed I've slept in for the past few years. 




 I wish people would give me random HP quizzes.... I have an arm completely devoted to HP (tattoo sleeve) and no one ever asks me anything. 




 I just feel like I don't want to exist. Not suicidal, just like I don't want to be anymore. I want to be numb, to not feel anything. But I also don't want that, because then that would still be existing. I don't know what to do or think, or feel. I need a lot of help right now, and I feel like I can't turn to the one person I used to be able to turn to, because I don't feel like she would actually care. But I know she would, and that she would do anything to help me. I just can't bring myself to talk to her about it. 




 So I feel like there was an update between this and Holly's 40 Nights in Hell. Can anyone link it for me? I feel like she gave us an update wherein she details when Jude told her about the portal. I could be wrong, and if I am, please let me know. I'm going back and rereading everything to see if I can pick up clues to help them. 




 I would actually suggest rock salt versus sea salt. Much more pure, much stronger at keeping evil at bay. 




 Hope you and Holly are still safe.... I know we are all worried about you. 




 Yeah. He was always really creeped out by them. We found like this dead animal down there back when we were kids, and he swore up and down it was a human body and made us leave. Thats why he would never go with me again.
Thats.comforting. Wow.
Relax. It was just a dog or something that fell in and got stuck. I felt bad for it but it definitely wasnt a dead person.

Guys, Caleb knew what this was.... This is why he freaked out so much. He knew way more than he initially let on. 

Caleb, if you're reading this, sorry to call you out like that.  




 Guys, all I have to say right now is be careful. I know the new moon is coming on soon, and I don't want you guys to end up hurt or dead. 

Also, Holly, be careful the next time you meet up with Lucifer. He seems somewhat trustworthy from what I've read so far, and all the lore I've ever read about him seems to state that he doesn't lie all that much. He does on occasion, and I do know that most true Demons don't lie. They may leave some stuff out of their deals with humans, but they don't lie. Angels lie. A lot. Just tread with caution. 




 I had to swipe on either the top or bottom of my computer to do so, but I have a touchscreen. I don't know what you have, but maybe try googling it?  




 Everyone knows that reddit reaches across the veil to the other world just as easily as I'm typing this out. We've all seen the ghost stories :) 




 Isaiah, when can we get an update from your time gone? I know I'm curious as to what happened to you for sure.  




 How long ago was this? 




 What the fuck is in your car with you?! Update us quickly, OP!!
