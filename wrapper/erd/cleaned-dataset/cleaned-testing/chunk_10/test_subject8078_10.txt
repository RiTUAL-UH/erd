 It is. I literally watched a Biography program on him this morning.   




 He gave Quentin 900k for his next movie after Reservoir Dogs. When QT gave him the screenplay (of Pulp Fiction) for the first time, it was the Final Draft.  But Danny was critical in getting John Travolta green lit.  QT wanted him, but the other money-backers saw Travolta as a washed up actor.  




 You can try and get one from a grad student.  But a prof letter will provide more "punch" for your application.   




 Start emailing the profs you worked under again.  Don't email the grad students.  You'll probably need to exert some effort with the profs, unless they remember you 100% and are completely on board.  So try to set up a meeting or two, so y'all can reconnect.  Good Luck.  




 You can't really do it in a social situation, but I've heard singing helps with learning the flow of English.   



















 I have the book. I am reading the book.  But I want an electronic copy of it as well.

 Also, does anyone have an electronic copy of it? I can't find it anywhere, and it would be nice to read this on my tablet.   




 I am in the middle of reading it now, and I've been told it is a must read for every medical student.

 Well now I know.

 TIL, I always assumed it was like Albany, NY.  They didn't want to concentrate power in the bigger areas, SF/LA, so they compromised in Sacramento. 




 I have published in the [Journal of the American Heart Association](http://jaha.ahajournals.org/). They were the first open source journal I've dealt with and it was pretty good.  




 So a more accurate title is Unacceptable?  That makes complete sense......

 Then why not follow the NC/SC border.  Just seems weird.  But I agree that the NC Outer Banks should be apart of Norfolk's sphere.   




 Check out that 90 degree angle in North Carolina. Why wouldn't they just follow the NC/VA or NC/SC border instead?

 Even though one relative is a Great-Great-Grandfather, born in CA? 




 Let's say me, my parents and three of my grandparents were born in California.  Others moved here at various times. Would I be Second Generation Californian? Third? Fourth?

I tried to make a quick hypothetical [family tree](http://i.imgur.com/iMwcMcr.png).  Orange = born in CA; Blue = moved to CA; White = Born/lived outside of CA. 














 I would like something medical related to hang up in my apartment, but haven't found anything I like.  There are a lot of [nursing](http://www.allposters.com/-sp/1950s-1960s-Woman-Nurse-Pointing-to-Eye-Chart-Posters_i10525551_.htm), [weed](http://www.allposters.com/-sp/What-s-Your-Pleasure-Medical-Marijuana-Pot-Dispensary-Blacklight-Poster-Posters_i9498883_.htm), and [cringe-worthy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/112017898/keep-calm-poster-8-x-10-art-print-keep) items out there, which is not what I want. 

The only semi-neat one I like is this [Lucky Strike Physicians](http://171.67.24.121/tobacco_web/images/tobacco_ads/doctors_smoking/20679_physicians/large/lucky_20679.jpg) one.

Anyone have thoughts?

 Assuming you didn't go to University of Phoenix, I think you would be fine.  They don't want you taking up space in classes you already took at a 4-year.  But again, call the registrar to confirm.  Don't assume.  




 Assuming you went to an accredited (legit) college, then yes.  I was able to earn a second BS, with only taking the core classes for my new degree. And I thought this was the norm. But reading the other comments, it sounds like that isn't true.  I would contact the registrar at the college you intend on attending.

 Exactly!  They're just being whiny neckbeard bitches.  And to think I actually liked that sub and contributed content.   









 Two of them, messaged me about it.  Said I could change my user name and post again.  Because they don't like Somali Pirates.  I mean WTF? 




 If you have RES, hover over the subreddit until the popup shows. Then click the green "+filter" button.  It will automatically filter that sub.
