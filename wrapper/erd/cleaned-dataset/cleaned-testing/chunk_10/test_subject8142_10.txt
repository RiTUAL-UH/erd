 That's my theory on whoever wrote all the Dora the Explorer songs. 




 The Charlie Weis approach! 




 I mean he was a pretty dominant football player. 




 Just make sure you don't go in boneless wing night instead. 




 So someone's going to cheat in a summer class? 




 But if this is the cost of attendance, then a lot of normal students getting scholarships for the full cost are also going to get this. 




 [Indiana Jones 5](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/05/indiana-jones-sequel-confirmed) 




 Especially since all of those movies are getting sequels/reboots. 




 Until the car industry changes, we're going to be using carbon copies for a while. 




 In Indiana, there's St. Mary's that's next door to Notre Dame, and there's also St Mary's of the Woods, which is around 3 hours away. A woman I met once said when she was at orientation for Saint Mary's of the Woods, the first night a girl said "Alright who wants to go find some Notre Same boys?" She was a little disappointed to find out she'd applied to the wrong Saint Mary's. 




 She. 




 Good to know I'm still cool. 




 Someone's not a Fanilow. 




 Also the Bill Bixby Hulk. Apparently Bruce was too gay of a name. 




 A lot of area codes require you to dial it anyway now. 




 [But that didn't mean he didn't do it!](https://youtu.be/3jxMXkN8_Y4) 




 A girl I knew in college actually had a guy leave while they were making out so he could go to confession right then. 




 The random Saturday afternoon showing I went to probably had 5x as many people as the opening night Age of Ultron showing I went to. 




 I believe Groot also first showed up in a horror comic in 1961 or so. 




 Wouldn't it be more like the people who make a point to say Happy Holidays? 




 And Ski Lodge Girl on Boy Meets World! 




 TBH 2004 was probably a year dominated by R B of anything, led by Usher. 




 Baseball has mercy rules even in college unless it's a tournament game. 




 Hell you just need to go Elletsville in the same county for that. 




 The rest of those were already protected. 




 The rest of those were already protected. 




 The rest of those were already protected. 




 Glenda Ritz got more votes than he did. 




 8-5 and Coachocinco stays! 




 Oh I couldn't care less that he did it. Just takes away from him being the most ND player possible. 




 I mean, I think getting suspended for smoking pot hurts that a little. 




 It was also in every preview. 




 They started Rusty Lisch for a game back in the 80s. He's been deemed the worst NFL player of all time. He got pulled for Payton. 




 A friend of mine was watching late night TV with his parents and older sister. A Girls Gone Wild commercial came on and his sister was in it. He noped out of there and went to bed. 




 Whedon had wanted to do it in the first episode but didn't have the budget, this was 6 seasons later so he had a chance to do it then. 




 Coachocinco takes us to 8-5 anyway! 




 My man Mitch! 




 I just want to watch reality shows with Kaitlyn and Carly. 




 You'd pull someone over for going 30 in a 25? 




 It's not that simple, though. The issue here is that FOIA and FERPA aren't really meant to overlap, but in a case like this they can. FERPA tends to supersede FOIA. 




 That's all Hulk wants anyway. 




 We only got Ant-Man stuff around 2 weeks ago. 




 We do teach blocking to all receivers really well. 




 Absolutely. 




 Didn't Luck and Newton put up similar combine numbers? 




 Skip's done fairly well. He's not his dad but he's been solid. 




 He ran the ball fine for the most part he just doesn't do it enough. 




 That's already our nickname for Brian Kelly. 




 Definitely not gay, could very well have been using it as an excuse to bang women. He definitely dated a lot at ND. 




 Yeah they didn't need more wings, so the only freshman they called up was a center. 




 Increased my personal interest in the game. 




 Go for it. 




 Yes please. 




 4B for 2 then 4A for 2. 




 Knott 13. 




 Aka guys dorm or girls dorm RAs. 




 We did have the freshmen who got busted in fall of 2010 for weed though
 Hell one of them had a building named after him and still got a semester. 




 Don't worry, that commission only counts if you get 5 in a month if it works the same way it used to. 




 2009 kills me because we had 11 future NFL players getting playing time on that defense. Not to mention Jimmy throwing to Golden, Floyd and Rudolph. 6-6. 




 You got your wish..... 




 I mean that kind of started in the first episode with J. August Richards. Plus Amy Acker later. 




 Fucking dirty spin there. 




 But I love Lane Kiffin! 




 I did it as best I could a while ago given some of the spotty records on teams like West Virginia Wesleyan. It converged to the starting point of normal one. 




 Not ND football. They saved ND. 




 They also go to a bowl game almost every year. 




 Started an hour later. 




 [Just don't block like this](http://youtu.be/WcTaRThg2mQ) 




 The only story I've heard of someone being fully punished for having sex at ND was a girl who liked to leave her blinds open and had a room in Farley on the first floor right by North Dining Hall. Can't speak to how true those story is but multiple people in Farley have told me that story. 




 Also the reason Kim Dunbar donated was to meet football players. 




 Everyone knows Kanye raps about Fish Fillets and croissants, not chicken. 




 I'm much more salty about 12 men not getting called against FSU on the punt right before they called it on us. And the complete lack of holds called on FSU. 




 He was MVP of his high school team. A team with Max Wittek on it. 




 Well his name is Golson so... 




 I was hanging out with him in PE his freshman year before he lost the weight. He forgot his phone on the 1st floor and had to walk down from the 4th. He was gone for like a half hour so we got worried. Turned out he needed to take a nap downstairs before he came back up. 




 Roommate tried to give Jimmy Clausen a head nod. Jimmy just shook his head at him.

Played catchphrase with Louis Nix, the best clue he gave was "the thing only guys have and something you hang around your neck. (Dick Cheney).

Also Tyler Eifert once ended a group presentation with a bite from a quarter pounder. It was a presentation on McDonald's to be fair. 




 Papists vs. Rapists 




 ND was cheaper than if I'd gone in state to Purdue. 




 He went 3rd overall in my league with mostly Bengals fans. 




 In ND's student handbook I believe you can get kicked out for having sex. 




 Only thing better is lefty specialty reliever. Pitch to one guy and you're done. 




 Loved that they found a way to use Drunken Sailor and Autumn Wind in the same episode, since they're basically the same song. 




 I'm so confused about a day where Andrew Hendrix wins and Gunner Kiel loses. 




 K N O T T Knott Hall! 




 Winning. 




 It happened in my last dynasty in NCAA. 




 He's a great NFL coach. He just isn't good in college. He wasn't particularly good as OC at Florida, either. 




 Could be UD too. 




 I'd also guess around 98% of our student body goes to games. We might have more students go than Cause does every week. 




 As long as they're forward passes why wouldn't they count? 




 There's a reason we played an away game in Ireland a few years ago. 




 We play at neutral sites for away games a lot. I think it's because they want bigger stadiums because they know they'll sell out. 




 No cheating boyfriends except the entire god damn plot of season 5. 




 How the hell did Barbara Streisand get pulled into this? 




 They didn't seem to mind Bo not winning any. 




 Yeah I just got mine as well, 10/13 also. Hoping this means it ships earlier. 




 Hey so I have no idea if this is what did it, but I happened to be trying on my tablet and it worked. So maybe try on mobile or someone can confirm if it works on desktop, too. 




 Well Icon has always been owned by Marvel. They were basically created so that their comic people could mess with comic ideas outside the traditional heroes and continuities. This way no one is wondering when Kick Ass comes to 616 or something. 




 They stacked the box. 




 It's usually not the worst idea to bet the underdog to cover in any game we've played recently. 




 Can we bring Jimmy off the bench? That worked pretty well in 2009. 




 My man Mitch!
