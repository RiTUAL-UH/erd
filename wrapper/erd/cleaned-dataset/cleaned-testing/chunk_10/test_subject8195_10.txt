 I have a nice pair of tropentarn BDU's, but I'm not a fan of German gear, just camo lol 




 I'm currently collecting [HK guns] (http://i.imgur.com/Pmq1ccR.jpg) 




 **Straight up hangers boy** 




 You will get a quote if you post a video of yourself eating three plastic clothes hangers.

 Yeah, I'm a huge fan of it.  
I loved the whole first season when I was like, 11 or so and rewatched it. Afterwards, literally the day after, the news of the first cour of the second season came out. Ever since I've been keeping up. 




 I've been keeping up on Durarara!! X2 Ten and Gakkou Gurashi, which have been fun shows. 




 Welcome to the Den of Autism.  
 




 Muds 




 MOD ABUUUUUUSE  
MOD ABUUUUUUSE 




 But can't you believe in a god and be, say, Jewish, Hindu, Muslim etc. etc.? 




 Sidebar.  
Also that gun sucks, don't get it. 




 Sounds dank.  




 Good point. 




 [Try this. Make look dank.] (http://i.imgur.com/yXaqEOI.jpg)

 *Nobodycan'thaveaPCoto 




 Love you reascr bb 




 Yee 




 lol I'm good. I'm just gonna aquascape my current tank and put a betta in it 




 The seams on the body are horrible/the gun splits apart sometimes, the outer barrel assembly always twists around the hop up unit, double feeds, and a bunch of other shit 




 Eh 




 [Looks like a 552 had sex with a UMP-45.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1So4177kDdE)  
Maybe he's thinking of P229? 




 I got a copy of that yesterday.  
*It's not for watching though.* 




 Dank fish gat is my baby, and it's a horrible gun 









 PB2? 




 No 




 /r/truewomensliberation, I'd assume 




 Yeah, I'm getting a concealed carry when I'm old enough.  




 Same with Detroit, they have super strict gun laws too and strict CCW laws 









 Alright thanks man 




 1. So I know there's not gonna be another season after seeing the whole third season circlejerk, but do they ever reach the North?

2. Is there manga or something I can read to see what happens?

3. Is it worth reading what happens, or should I just leave it at blissful unawareness and pretend they have fun adventures forever?

Thanks in advance.  




 Even if it's from sand wear, a gun wouldn't be this worn.  
Also most soldiers take precautions so their gun doesn't get this worn, and are punished if their gun is in bad condition. 




 Even in real life, guns aren't usually this worn. At all. 




 I'm just saying, no gun is ever that worn and it's worn in places you don't even put your hands. 




 Yes. HK best guns. 




 My Average HK416 Can't Be This Cute! 




 What sort of content samples are you guys looking for? 




 **1.** Dress up in trench coat  
**2.** Take airsoft gun without an orange tip into a school  
**3.** ???  
**4.** Profit 




 My average HK416 




 [Ayy] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP8EhNwF4ZA) 




 Yee
 




 Alright, thanks for that little tidbit.  




 You guys just released another [SA-58 on Evike] (http://www.evike.com/products/54823/), and I was wondering if you guys are the sole OEM, or if it's a rebrand? 




 Wow an overdone and worn out meme.  
*Slow clap* 




 Flibba booma big bam 




 Aye 




 I moderate a small chat sub called /r/A_irsoft where we all have autistic fun and make fun of everything 




 I fill dark hole in soul with dank airhard.  
Though my walls are covered in guns, I strive for more.

More than I can reach.  




 Why has God abandoned us 




 AHAHAHAHA WOW 




 Oh that's a nice and exotic idea.  




 Alright, thanks. Bee shrimp are cheap so I'll try it out 




 I was planning to convert a 10 gallon tank into an aquascape, and I thought a betta fish would be a good choice. I was thinking of picking up a few bee shrimp, but I'm not sure if a betta will get along with bee shrimp.  




 It's a song.  
Just a bad one. 




 What are you asking?  
I'm really really really confused. 




 Dude I'd so wear one of those lol

I almost got a [Hannya half mask] (http://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Hannya-Mask-Kabuki-Airsoft/dp/B008ASA5I6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8qid=1436931411sr=8-1keywords=hannya+maskpebp=1436931418575perid=1NFTQYK3DF2MH1QGH7FM) for airsoft once. 




 That is hilarious 




 Noh masks are awesome but terrifying. 




 Holy shit, is this you?  
This is horrifying and amazing 




 You can get it on Amazon 




 Rakt and Quakt 




 Just because I look the part doesn't mean anything (   ) 




 Seems like it was made for the gun or something 




 What?  
I was born in '97 and I'm only 17.

They draft kids that young? 




 Auto erotic asphyxiation  




 Man, that AFG really meshes nice with the body and rail covers. 




 In all honesty, it came off when I got the gun out of the box.

I leaned it against my desk with the barrel on the floor, and the flashhider cracked off after about thirty seconds of it sitting there with the weight of the gun on it. 




 Dude nice, I have the Echo 1 rebrand of that gun. Only difference is that my orange tip was easy as hell to take off, the plastic was like chalk lol 




 I like vanilla furniture with a railed receiver.  
Like a standard SA 58 




 I'm not a fan of the OSW platform of FAL, I'm more of a classic FAL kind of guy lol 




 G3 is my main bitch lol 




 G3 is best raifu, but FAL is second dankest 




 Weird to think of it like that, but yeah prolly 




 Nice 




 I got FAL flair.  
I'm speshul 




 Ilumat is spreading da chemtrails 









 Oh, you should look into re-pro stuff.  
There's some nice re-pro MARSOC stuff. 




 Isn't M81 really cheap and in surplus stores everywhere? 




 I already have everything planned, but thanks lol.

I was planning on turning the tank into a planted betta tank. 




 ye 




 I hate cyclists who don't use stop signs.  




 The slide is just a blur lol 




 I'm guessing you haven't been around long? 




 Looking good.  
Way better starting point than I had lol 




 This goes back to the fun little adventure. I wouldn't be so critical of it if it didn't win so many pointless rewards and oscars and shit.

 




 I thought Frozen was a fun little adventure, but I didn't think it deserved so many rewards They reused character models from the movie Tangled all over, and there was useless comedic relief and shitty development 




 Same.  
Overrated and too much random comedic relief where it wasn't needed. 




 ayy 




 I convinced the new cook at my work that my name is Hououin Kyouma.  
First thing he said to me after introducing himself, "I like to take lsd and shrooms."

Sounds like a winner.  




 Holy shit, the dude's name at the end of the Pokemon games credits?  
Weird to think a little thing like that still sticks, seeing his name at the end of the credits and stuff 




 I don't know a specific design off of the top of my head. I was just saying skulls are cliche and overdone.  




 Other things besides skulls. Different designs.  




 Skull masks are a little cliche, but at least you did a good job.  




 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Yes 




 **I've won.** 




 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Poo 




 He uses the hospital electrode suction cup thing armor 




 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Yes. 




 I thought mine were shit.  
I chortled.  




 \Yes. 




 **Yes.** 




 ^^^^^^^^^Maybe. 




 **Yes.** 




 *Yes.* 




 K. Then album is dankfect.  




 *Yes.* 




 Yes. 




 ayayeyeae lmamoalmsllama 




 ayyy 




 \Using my word 'dankiest'  
 




 Wait so phrases or no phrases? 




 Ohhh you said they needed phrases in a comment.  
Alright they all got titles and they're good.  




 I got names, but phrases is confuse.  
http://imgur.com/a/J7fLy 




 What if we're confused what to put as a name or title, should we just use a general blanket term like, "Sad" or "What?" or something? 




 Yep.  
3 u reascr bb 




 Oooooh, that's another good point.  
 




 I think being able to hate and identify what a weab is makes you safe from being a weab.  




 I think when someone identifies as an Otaku, then deep inside they know they're a weab and they accept it by using a different outward term.  




 There's a bunch in there I rarely use too lol 




 Yep 




 He's half-ghillie man. [Classic.] (http://i.imgur.com/zUrC8m7.png) 




 I added like three more. 
[Now it is complete.] (http://imgur.com/a/J7fLy) 




 ayy yeah dude [this one?] (http://i.imgur.com/JJzlqSf.jpg)  
It's now in the album. 




 Alright I'll drop an [album] (http://imgur.com/a/J7fLy), dank weab may mays and regular may mays. 




 Do it do it do it do it 




 He only has chat. I'd trust him with perms, he is dank
