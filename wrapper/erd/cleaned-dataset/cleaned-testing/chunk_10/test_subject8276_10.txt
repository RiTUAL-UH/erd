 The second definitely the third is good too after that though they become weird.  




 Yeah I remember that episode it was a little creepy.  




 Yeah that one gave me chills.  




 Okay cool I will do that, yeah I like having the physical copy and I like my bookshelf but sometimes I want a little variety and I cant really carry 3 books around when I ride the bus, though thats not impossible.  




 Oh yeah.  




 Awesome dude  









 Cool  




 Okay I will  




 Okay cool ill get one next week when I get payed.  




 Alright im convinced ill buy one  




 so I kinda want a Kindle I mean i do love reading a physical book all the time but whenever I take them into my backpack it always gets bent or I spilled something on one the other day. Is it worth the money???  




 Yes that was a letdown for me.  




 Yes so awesome  




 I remember thinking that back when I heard about it then watching it for the first time and thinking wow he is so great in this!!!!!  




 Completely agree  




 Yeah LOL.  




 Hes gonna be on a Woody Allen movie next year and that one he has with Bill Murray looks good.  




 LOL funny  




 Okay so I am a 23 year old Male I am slighgtly overweight but I do not have diabetes and i have had no major medical problems my whole life. For as long as I can remember I have had double vision up close though, I always thought everyone had it but recently i talked to my cousin who said she doesnt have it either. Now it isnt everthing its just the objects that are like 3 feet away if my finger or pencil is directly in front of me it is double. Whats the problem???  




 Such an awesome Marvel movie though they always are, I laughed so hard at parts and was astonished by all of the action too. Cant wait to see him again!!!!!  




 so funny one of Marvels best!!!!!!!  




 me too although I was hoping it would be good and it didnt dissapoint!!!!!  




 That makes sense.  




 YAY my future wife is finally nominated!!!!!!!!!!!  




 you really only need to see the first one IMO it sucks that they erased T2 but whatever.  




 Yeah me too I loved the first one!!!!  




 I freaking cant wait!!!!!!!!!  




 LOL a Bond villain.  




 I liked it a real mystery film with fantasy/horror elements and stuff, radcliffes performance was good too.  




 Tatiana maslany IDK who tho  




 A Thor villain  




 A spiderman villain.  




 That is so cool  




 Me and Earl and the Dying Girl  




 Yes  




 Thats later in the movie though I meant when they first enter the cave it says there is a silhouette or something but I cant find it.  




 UK version or the unrated version for the US I believe.  




 So I recently watched The Descent for the first time ever I really liked it and wish I had seen it sooner. Anyways I read on the trivia page of IMDB that there is a split second shot of a crawler early in the film but for the life of me I cannot find it. What time exactly does it happen and where is it onscreen???  




 It was never freakin filmed  




 Yeah thats a good point damit why did I pay to see it then LOL.  




 Saw it yesterday and I am already planning on seeing it again. It was soo good!!!! I was laughing and in tears throughout the whole movie I LOVED it!!!!!!! From the hospital scene onward I was in tears pretty much.  




 Yeah its good to see him do somehting finally. I like Vince in this role.  




 Well yes but that was the most recent the first was probably The Lion King when I was younger.  




 AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  




 Me and Earl and The Dying Girl  




 Freaking Jerkheads  




 I have only ever cried in a movie twice before I can now say three times. Man that scene you know what scene I mean that really got me.  




 UGH im so mad that they spoiled it that would have been a great twist and stuff.  




 Yeah thats what im thinking.  




 Yeah that part sucked I didnt use the internet back then either so if the trailer didnt show me I would have been totally surprised.  




 Take her to the Moon for me Joy  




 Evangeline Lily was an extra on Freddy vs Jason in the high school scene.  




 WOW that happened to me too, I thought the theater messed up or something and it was showing the Spy trailer but then it switched and I realized what happened.  




 WELL THATS SUCKS!!!!!!  




 I liked it, it was cool just wish it was R Rated and that christian bale came back as John Connor.  




 Yeah this one for me too, I remember wandering into the adult section once and seeing it then I was afraid to sleep that night or a few after that. It still gives me the willies sometimes too.  




 OMG I was about to post this!!!!!! Yes I remember wandering into the adult section and seeing that once and it scared the crap out of me. It still kind of gives me the willies when I think about it.  




 Work and plus sometimes they say "oh im going to get my hair done" but then they are gone for like 5 hours.  




 So I live with my family my mom, dad, brother, and my sister is visiting from college. Also my cousin is visiting for the summer too. Anyways I go to work usually and I mostly just do that and come home, I also go to the movies a lot like twice a week. My mom and sister though have been sneaking out and going to the cinema by themselves I think they tell my dad sometimes but noone else. Like just today they were gone for like 7 hours and didnt tell anyone, It just annoys me when they do that mainly cuz I always go by myself and so I love when someone else is with me plus I like going as a family. But whenever they do that it just peeves me off like "oh I dont need to tell you, its just us girls". The weird thing is too my mom rarely used to go to the movies shes only started going when my sister is here, it just pisses me off, next time they leave the house I am gonna go with them!!!!  




 He can really shine in dramas I wish he would do more of those heck I wish he would do more movies period LOL. He has always been my favorite actor though.  




 I am so in shock!!!!!  




 Yeah I had to turn my tv up to 70 and I still could barely hear them.  




 YES!!!!!!  




 A movie starring Mrs Fug, yes only idiots will see this "film".  




 To get the butts in the seats thats it!!!!  




 Thats a good point, a brief cameo will do likely in the post credits scene, although I wish it was at least a bit part.  




 Its a universe where a purple alien and a sentient robot as well as a talking racoon and tree exist, Im sure if a guy in a spidersuit showed up randomly it would work.  




 I wish that were true but its gonna be small, I wish he would have a role like quicksilver on days of future past that would be cool.  




 LOL thats funny!!!!!  




 Yes he can.  




 Yeah he basically is the main one well third i guess.  




 Its most definitely a cameo. Wish they had more time to film a more substantial role.  




 Im excited to see how this turns out.  




 I remember doing that a few times!!!!  




 I thought it was good, a little boring yes but so was the first season, I like the new characters Colins is the best and for some reason he reminds me of Rust Cohle. I am looking forward to this season!!!  




 That Adam sandler movie I now pronounce you chuck and larry should have been R, IMO I cant really see why it is PG13.  




 He would be perfect!!!! They would likely film it in new zealand and he would make them three movies.  




 I wish he was as big as he used to be he is my all time favorite actor he always has been.  




 I dont think any one of the ones who invented facebook were involved in it at all.  




 I thought it was good, i liked the storyline and stuff.  




 Mad Max Fury Road 




 Of course jimmy.  




 Yes it is.  




 Thats why I hate small town theaters.  




 Because lots of people still watch it in the theater and buy the dvd/bluray.  




 I thoughht it was decent though it need a few better storylines like others have said before.  




 It was nice seeing Bryce dallas howard not play a bitch for once.  




 LOL yeah so hilarious!!!!!  




 Yeah I wish he had a cameo or something that way he could have reprised two of his most famous roles this one and Independence Day 2.  




 That part was funny.  




 why the hell did Asa not get picked it sucks. I guess id go with Holland he seems like he will get the job anyways.  




 Maybe have a few scenes with him just starting or something then Tony approaches him to join his side and then just have him in a few more scenes in battles and stuff.  




 Man I HATED that season!!!!!!  




 That was Gus.  




 Yeah of all of the shows I have seen cancelled over the years a lot of them are from fox.  




 Of all the shows I wish werent cancelled so suddenly it was that one.  




 Sounds good never liked him anyways.  




 Because he is old good parts for older actors are rare nowadays.  









 I used to think Johnny Depp was on the first Scream movie for like the longest time but then I realized it was a different actor Skeet Ulrich.  




 That would have been cool actually 
 




 Because im cool.  




 The Joker from The Dark Knight and im pretty sure I am right too.  




 YAYA  




 Finally.  




 Yeah hes cool.  




 I always thought Idirs Elba was American and I was shocked to hear that he was actually british. Also David Anders did a british accent in like 3 shows so I thought he was british until I learned he was American.  




 Ive never even heard her real voice thats cuz I rarely watch interviews though.  




 BOOO You suck Disney!!!!!!!  




 I always thought that when Vincent sees the coyote he realizes he is no different, he is a scavenger and he kills to live or something.  




 yeah its a nice one I remember I used to always watch it and stuff.  




 yeah she is really good!!!! 




 man I wish he had done Jobs that would have been epic.  




 thats a good example. A Wolverine movie under his direction would have been excellent. Instead he did the abysmal Noah.  




 yeah thats a dissapointment  




 I was wondering what are some of the most dissapointing departures in film ie Edgar Wright would have been an awesome director for Ant man but he left. Things similar to that.  




 I think its hilarious!!!!!! One of my favorite shows.
