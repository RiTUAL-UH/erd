 I was told to use a different source  for my [submission](https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/331a92/leaked_email_reveals_how_hollywood_opposed_fair/) , but I find it odd that a news site such as Huffington Post is banned on /r/news. Does anyone have a whitelist for /r/news? Also, who would be the appropiate Reddit staff employee to contact concerning this? Community Manager?
