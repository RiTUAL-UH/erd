 [Kobaryo - Clock Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnc6VykRI7E) this is the song that got me into the J-Core scene (that melody)! J-Core is a huge part of my life and I urge everyone on this thread listen to some. Now lets talk about Kobaryo.... He is so fucking talented!! 

* [t+pazolite - Pumpin' Junkies (Kobaryo's FTN Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQRsCXY5MGA) a caotic Speedcore song with both House and Jazz breakdowns

* [Kobaryo - Evolution Canceler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6j7qg4_5RM) a skull cracking Speedcore Crossbreed fusion! 

* [Kobaryo - Necrophagiatoast ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIxY7Yoqat8) insane 666 BPM Terror/Speedcore :)   

* [Srezcat   Kobaryo - Speed Complex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-Kcu7a-qUM) a fantastic Electro House track that turns into melodic Speedcore at the second drop, also Kobaryo = Srezcat
* [Srezcat - Expect](https://soundcloud.com/srezcat/expect) an amazing reverse bass Hardstyle song

Also check out [Psycho Filth Records](http://psychofilthrecords.net/) and [Freakin Works](http://freakinworks.net/)  




 another question for you guys! how do you feel about the Japanese hardcore scene?  




 Hardcore   DnB 









 Question for both of you guys! How do you go about making kicks? Both hardcore and industrial/crossbreed  




 Yes I have! I'll send it back soon ;) 




 Remember the time when they turned into fucking killer whales and one of them gets their fucking stomach sliced open? Animorphs was fucking hardcore 




 I tried it once, it wasn't bad but it was pretty boring I mean mozzarella cheese curds, french fries and gravy. Not a lot of flavor

Edit: oooo onion chunks sound good maybe throwing in some spiced hamburger and instead of mozzarella throw in some cheddar (deep fried cheddar cheese curds if you want it greasy like Steve) mmmmmm poutine is sounding better by the minute, thanks /u/Slaide   




 [Based demo did a really good summary of it](http://youtu.be/B_YjrTyxde8) 









 wasn't made by me but from the sounds of it I think its some of their indie game vids  









 # liam still lives with his mom and she still treats him like he's in grade school 

# best thing ever 




 Thanks man! I didn't know who made this also [holy shit he can draw REALLY WELL](http://johnsu.deviantart.com/art/Red-Rider-Hood-521791946)

Holy shit x2 [he drew this pic!](http://johnsu.deviantart.com/art/Ebi-Ramen-410390546) this is one of my favorite peices of digital art
 




 My liam can't be this cute (taking it up from bro on sis) 



















 Or just random pictures of him yelling at kids while throwing mayo at them  









 I've been playing a lot of distance lately and I am blown away by how good some of player created maps are, go download afew :) 




 When I saw the "bad Hardstyle" sample I knew I had to do somthing with it, so I did some quick distortion and threw it into a vocodex. Still don't know how to make my own reverse bass but that's for another time :) 









 Omg mines so bad ;_; all of you guys did a good job on this. Good vibes all around 









 Gimme gimme tasty raiders, be they chem fiends or legionaries, spend my hard earned action points on caravans, brahmin and brotherhood boys 




 that's one of the reasons I love fallout, all the stories that the great war silenced and created and then piecing together what happened through clues in the environment and text logs     




 Can confirm am orchestra kid (bass player)  




 I have to say that S3RL's latest releases have made me kind of sad :( but I like this one, the off beat bass is really thick and punchy  









 Ayy lmao 




 I'm fairly certain it is  




 I didn't make this (I'll be sure to credit the artist in the title next time to avoid confusion) [Heres the full sized version from the download button](http://orig14.deviantart.net/e76a/f/2015/084/0/e/hotline_miami_fan_art_by_rhoogers-d8n5qqh.jpg)  




 dude I know that feeling, I had just bought an album and the next day the artist gave away a discount code  




 [Link to the album](http://muffinmusic.bandcamp.com/)

[Proof](http://imgur.com/uat8otv) 









 GFD!! I seriously feel like their is a gnome downvoting every thing that has to do with hard dance. Its consistent too, I'll post something and 5 minuets later it has a downvote    














 ahhhhh.... no no no I don't want to think about that  









 yep! just set up the pitch envelope and play around with the unison pitch thickness and bam industrial kick! you can get some really gnarly sounds    









 Shock:force is quitting hardtrance :( he was one of the few artists still producing, man I wish thera would bring Therabyte back ironically unknown is my jam/the song that got me into HT. It's not all bad though DBD still makes HT and Kidd kaos is making a comeback! 









 can you still play the prototype they have on the site? it wont let me play even though I have unity/used internet explorer/enabled that one thing it said to enable  









 not really underrated but paris I love that song so much!  




 After hearing all of this I have no reason not to beleve you :) 




 dude you are like my favorite guy right now! thank you for this! 

BTW what are some of the things you used to make these? 




 7 of them! Enjoy :)

BTW! I synthesized these at G2 and 175bpm 

[Here are some Wavs if you don't have Harmor :)](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xipvdfxksc5t85m/AABHQEiSzerZaFB70pnCz1q3a?dl=0) 









 naw man if anything you made it better  




 Dose anyone know where the vocal samples are from? They sound really familiar  









 Don't comment just to hate dude 














 yep this is it thank you :D
