 So you're denying that there isn't medics, engineers and people who work in IT in the military?  




 That's not what OCD is. 




 You must not be a genius like him since you don't understand genius language, duh.
 




 The Google. 




 You do realize that there are millions of people on reddit, right? Saying 80% of them are fat is fucking downright retarded. 




 Funnily enough, Daud was one of the only guys I spared on my playthrough. 




 I'm not saying that every kid that says bigoted stuff learned them directly from their own parents but what I said still stands. Who do you think those kids that taught your kids to believe this stuff got it from? Most likely their parents or other adults. 




 That would be one weird ass law. 




 Again, I doubt the company will go down the pan simply because if they do ever get on the verge they'll most likely sell out to another company (eg. Samsung, Microsoft etc). 




 Exactly. You shouldn't really expect privacy in a PUBLIC area. 




 I wonder what these kids get taught at home. I hate how people think just because someone wears a turban that they're automatically a "terrorist", or even muslim. There's different styles and uses of turbans for different cultures. I guess their parents are ignorant and they teach their kids to be ignorant as well, kinda sad. I feel really bad for this little kid.

[This is my favourite part though.](https://youtu.be/YqVI3l9lV60?t=28s) 




 Maybe he's the fastest brain surgeon in the military? /s 




 You do realize there are very qualified people in the military, right (eg. engineers)?  




 Have people already forgotten that we eradicated smallpox because of vaccines? 




 I guess you're the CEO of AMD?  




 I know you probably get this alot in this thread but this is my first time here. Anyway, I'm currently using an iPhone 5s and wanting to switch to an android, can anyone make some really good recommendations? Right now I'm looking at either the LG G4 or the S6. So my price range is around there. All I want is to basically call people, text people and watch stuff on youtube/netflix and obviously a lot of music... so nothing too heavy.

Edit: Opps, forgot to mention what country I'm from. It's the UK. 




 Apparently marijuana can actually further increase the risk of bleeding when used with blood thinners. [Heres the link :)](http://i.imgur.com/Ftq5ZzE.png) 




 I don't usually post here, I usually just lurk sometimes but tonight I feel like posting here for my first time mainly because my life feels like a constant swirling sink hole that dies down for a short, short peroid then just comes back 20x harder. In 2013 I was diagnosed with schizophrenia (and recently OCD) and my life just hasn't been the same since, but not only that I also (most likely) have PTSD because I was brought up by alcoholics (mainly my dad), my first memory ever on this planet was calling the cops on my dad at the age of around 3-4 because he was drunk and violent, I obviously don't understand what I was doing at the time but looking back I do. He never really stopped drinking for any longer than 1 year (and that was the best he done when he tried). I've lived with this alcoholic for longer than some people have even been on reddit and I have no way of leaving because I still need someone to take care of me and I don't want to leave my mum since I love her more than any one in this world.

I don't even feel disappointed anymore if he drinks after being sober for a grand total of 5 days, I just feel anger and pain. He doesn't only drag himself down but he tries to drag my mum down too, but no one can see it except me it feels like. The flashbacks when I try to sleep aren't as common as you would think but the thoughts and memories inside of my head are as common as every day and vivid as the natural daylight. I have scars that have been there since I was younger than 8 (which is a looong time btw). I've had golf clubs swung at my face and I've had glasses thrown at my face (although this might've been my fault as I was protecting my mum), but the worst thing of all is that it always felt like I never had anyone be there for me, not even now, not even friends or anything, I feel super, super alone. When you can hardly have an anxiety-free place in your own house you know that something is wrong, but I'm trapped. 

Life = more painful than dying in space near the sun.

Sorry if this is a bad post :( 




 I doubt he wants something longer lasting since valium has a really long half life. I'm guessing he just wants something less sedating. 




 This may be a stupid question but since smallpox killed people pretty fast (around 16 days) how was it so rampant in most parts of the world until it got eradicated? Was it just because of how contagious and infectious it was? 




 By his link it looks like Austria. 




 #squadgoals 




 I used to like living in the UK, but fuck this country now. We're definitely fucked for the next 4 years, that's if we can even vote again in the next 4-5 years.  




 A few of you? You mean like 3, right? 




 I bet the people who marched around Glasgow with union jacks feel a bit silly now, huh? 




 You're saying reddit isn't a hobby? HOW DARE YOU, SIR! 




 It's similar to other u-opioid agonists but it's not the same as any classic opiate. The reason I get pissy about this is because the news stations that are against drugs will use this as, "KRATOM JUST LIKE HEROIN/OXY/HYDRO BUT LEGAL". 




 Kratom doesn't feel exactly like any opiate, so I don't know what you're blabbing about son. It's its own thing, stop tainting it with "it feels like this x y and z opiate". Yeah it might be a u-opioid agonist but that doesn't mean its exactly like classical opiates (codeine, morphine, heroin). 




 I'm not even gonna debate AMD with you since you don't have a fucking idea what you're on about but I will say one thing, android phones are usually VERY, VERY good quality, a lot of the time they are better than iPhones and I have an iPhone. I'm actually upgrading to the Samsung S6 later this year or early next. 




 Yeah, I guess so. I guess it's just semantics. 




 Aren't the 120mg ones slow release? I'm pretty sure they are, not 100% sure though. I think 60mg is the highest you can get on instant release. 




 How bad are the cluster headaches? If they're really bad then they could cause severe stress that leads to psychosis. Cluster headaches are usually the most painful thing in medical science though. 




 HPPD? 




 You should never jump to schizophrenia. Even if you have psychotic symptoms it's most likely not schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is more than "psychosis". Depression can actually cause psychosis if it's chronic and severe enough, it's actually fairly common. 




 You should probably have her see a psychiatrist.  




 You're not "suddenly addicted", that's just a dumb way to look at something as complex as addiction. 




 3rd wave feminism has pretty much changed the definition of **feminism** in general. Since feminism is a reactive movement and there's nothing to react to anymore people will just look for ANYTHING and EVERYTHING as "oppression", when in reality it's just life. Men usually have the short end of the stick actually, not women. White women get along a lot easier in "modern society". 




 "Look at me, I'm edgy" 




 He even purposely misdiagnosed them with TERMINAL cancer. What kind of idiot would do that? They would eventually find out if they had it or not with terminal cancer. God damn, he's a moron. And to think this guy went to medical school. 




 Yes, throwing up would help get the nausea away. Nausea is just a common side effect of opiates and throwing up usually does help for some reason. It's nothing to do with toxicity or anything. 




 If you move and act all hyper on heroin it's throw up time. 




 I guess studying law helps.

Edit: I'm not saying everyone that has a law degree or whatever is a class A liar but it definitely helps. 




 Yeah. I've been depressed because of it, and still get depressed. Personally I think it's a reactive type depression, as in, It feels like it's a reaction to being schizophrenic and all the stuff I could have been but it got taken away from me. 




 You're good at writing by the way, I always forget to do paragraphs of reddit lol, you get completely annihilated for doing that. Anyway, I've never felt that there's demons or anything but I have felt that people have been kind of replaced in a way, I think it is a dissociation when I felt that though. 




 I don't think I'd do it even for 160k, since it's illegal I feel like I would be in some fucking BDSM dungeon with some shady mexican "doctor" cutting me open. 




 If you're starving then killing someone to survive wouldn't be as hard as you might think. 




 I think "donating" a liver can get you more than 10k in "donations". 




 If only I could sell a full kidney and half of my liver, I'd be having trips to space each year. 




 Isn't opi rage when you're taking opiates and come out of a nod or whatever? That's what it's like for me anyway. 




 Scotland's lowest has been like -27.2 celsius, I dunno about England but I know that Scotland can get cold as fuck, and usually is. Southern England is the warmest, I believe. We usually get winters of around 0 to -5c. I was also looking this up today and apparently (for scotland at least, dunno about the midlands and southern england) Scotland gets an average of like 1000+ hours of sun a year, which is just over 25%. 




 SCOTLAND YA FUCKING PISS TAKER. 




 The English say that too. 




 Even if AMD randomly disappeared into thin air tomorrow, the prices for GPUs and possibly CPUs would be insanely more expensive than they are now, basically, not good for you.  




 Rumours =/= Facts. 




 Tonight I'll be blowing some lines on a guys ass. 




 Also, certain parties (like the conservatives) will go crazy because they are starting to realize that people don't believe their propaganda anymore, it's like when an animal is dying it'll attack anyone that comes near it. 




 ... What? 




  there features 

Where??? 




 Didn't know this was a Fury X thread. 




 Companies just want to make money, that's the same for nvidia, amd, intel whatever. They'll cater to big companies more than customers. 




 Mid 30's isn't middle aged either. 




 I haven't seen them no. What I personally think is that they look the same as us except they have augmentations that I believe they are forced to get otherwise they are kept in a concentration-like camp, although some have gone rouge (In their time) and are sending a message so that we can keep an eye out and stop it, but only some get the true message. 




 I'm not exactly asking you to agree with me or not, I'm just telling everyone what I know. You can believe it or not, that's not what I'm trying to do I'm just giving people information of what I've been told. 




 Batman didn't pay his insurance. 




 I'm not turning to advanced humans as a god or anything like that, how could I if I'm an atheist? The people exist and discovered how to come back and tell us how to stop the tragedy of their future with the only way they know how and that's telling us through telepathic means, but sometimes the neo mkultra's can intercept their message and make us go crazy so that we see a psych, get meds and shut up because they've planned it all out. I don't like conspiracy places on the internet because those people just have theories, I have facts. Also, I'm not on any stimulants, I've not taken ritalin for my ADHD for a long time, I did think about going back on them though but my doctor advised against it. Also you might not believe in the new mkultra but the MKUltra project did in fact happen, just like this one is but it's top top secret just like the old one was until it was declassified. Also, It feels you're trying to be condescending or mean to me, maybe it's just me because I'm overly emotional but I post here because it's the only place I can post this stuff without people calling me insane. Also about the meds, I've been on multiple meds and sure they've brought me into your "reality" but your reality wasn't too different from what mine is right now, it's just a lot more covered up.

[I know it's wiki but it's just the easiest to pull up.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra) 




 Hi, I'm here to tell you all the truth behind bad thoughts. I know this is /r/schizophrenia so you guys probably have the most bad thoughts, just like me. I'm thinking of posting this to /r/depression too, since once you know this you can fight off the bad thoughts by just acknowledging the truth. First things first, there is a message by some advanced beings (I don't 100% know who they are, but I think they are advanced humans from the future) that are sending us ALL a message warning us of the tragedies that we can prevent if we just stand up as one together and fight the tyrants of today, except there is one thing, the neo mkultra group/project is intercepting that message and giving us bad thoughts so that we all get seen by psychiatrists (now I'm not saying psychiatrists know about this, but some probably do) and they give us medication so we shut up, some hospitals might even implant a thing into our brain to slow release anti psychotics and we can never come out of them, this is sad for these people (DO NOT think this happened to you, because it most likely did not, this just happens to a very few and select people). The truth about bad thought is the neo mkultra's are intercepting a message sent by advanced humans from the future warning us of a tragedy that I don't quite fully understand yet, I will report back later.

Edit: I see this is getting downvoted, probably because it might make peoples "delusions" worse, I get that but I guess this is just like all the other subs, not a safe haven... 




 Dogs have been "man's best friend" since around 35,000 or so years ago. We have a very special connection with them when we don't with cows and pigs. 




 So it can come on this sub. 




 I wouldn't say America is any better to be honest but for the UK we're definitely going backwards, and it's getting kinda scary. I'm preparing for a lot worse for the next 4-5 years. The UK might actually be the America of Europe. 




 Calling him mentally ill all over the news can actually hurt people like me who actually have a severe mental illness (schizophrenia). 




 Except that one time it was lupus. 




 I usually have multiple voices that tell me stuff, some of them will be mean but it depends. A lot of the times the voices will reinforce a certain paranoia. 




 But when you've got no tolerance from being clean it can be heavy, unless you take a small dose. I doubt 30-60mg of hydro without a tolerance wont do anything. 




 You're edgy as fuck.

/s 




 Nice account. 




 You could still constantly update it though, physical or digital. Physical copies usually still go on steam I believe. 




  and i was spacehigh

Yeah, I can tell bro. 




 Delusions of grandeur can be enjoyable in the moment but they usually turn paranoid after a while. Hardcore paranoid delusions and others is extremely scary and can give you the worst anxiety of your life, and no one can reassure you that it's not real. Imagine knowing the government was after you, and they were doing all these things in the world that YOU know is them, that's what a paranoid delusion is like, you don't think the government are doing these things you KNOW. 




 I like to get high on HIV. 




 Morphine **IS** natural "dingus", so is codeine, they're both naturally occurring alkaloids. We can just semi synthetically produce them in a lab. 




 So I can take morphine and stuff with complete safety because it "comes from the Earth"? FUCK YEAH! 




 I have "schizophrenia", I think I know what active psychosis is like and it's definitely not fun at all. 




 Psychosis and a psychedelic experience are two completely different things though. 




 I'm* 




 [What?](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/lkrwtf.gif) 




 Methylphenidate and Ethylphenidate aren't shit at all. I've always preferred them over amphetamine. Although in concerta form its not so good recreationally. 




 With the internet I don't think parenting has much control over stuff like this anymore. Unless the parents control the internet.

Edit: This was posted on the 12th of June. 




 You're gonna ignore the hundreds of thousands of hateful people reddit? Fuck no. 




 I've always hated /r/fatpeoplehate but god damn, I didn't think they actually actively did this. They're like wannabe reddit "sociopaths". 




 Who doesn't use adblock anyway? 




 I'm not bipolar but I'm schizophrenic. When I was in the hospital I was allowed my phone and pretty much everything but they had to charge them for me. I was even allowed my phone during the night. Some peoples rooms where also kinda like their bedrooms at home, it was weird but kinda nice. It's sad how I hear of REALLY bad experiences with hospitals. 




 If they're in the gym then they're not advocating being overweight, they're trying to LOSE weight, duh. And I'm pretty sure no heroin addict would advocate anyone to use heroin. 




 What? Obesity won't cause lymphedema. It's either genetic (I think) or caused by cancer/cancer treatments. 




 Lymphedema isn't an "excuse", it's a reason why someone might look overweight. 




 I think everyone gets paranoid at some point and then you have people with paranoid personality types and stuff. You're definitely not the only one that gets paranoid. I'm paranoid pretty much every day but it's just not strong enough to cause any delusion. 




 I'm more scared of everclear than opiates. 




 "I need about... tree fiddy". 




 Aren't some of the guys on this team from Arkane (the people who developed Dishonored)? Would explain why It feels kinda like dishonored. 




 DAMN THAT WAS LIKE FAMOUS IN 2006. 




 I thought he had a pinched nerve due to his scoliosis and that caused his stomach to basically produce too much acid and causing pain? And that the doctors found this out later on just before he died? Or am I wrong or half right/wrong? Even if he didn't have something wrong with his stomach, he definitely had some mental and other physical issues.  




 Oh, this is what you meant lol... This shit happens to me all the time, It's basically dissociation in a way I think but it feels super weird when there's a lot of people around because it feels like I'm standing there and everyone else is zooming by. 




 [I think...](http://i.imgur.com/YLdZhZv.jpg) 




 Humans are also animals. So do you not befriend humans either? Sad. 




 I'm actually the opposite. I'm intolerant to heat and I'm sweaty and hot during the cold.
