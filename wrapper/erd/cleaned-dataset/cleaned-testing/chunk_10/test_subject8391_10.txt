 The fight over states having control over federal land is an issue that has remained an undercurrent, but has the potential to become something much bigger. There is a concerted effort by Republicans to open up national parks to mining and oli interests, as well as prevent more land becoming part of the national park system.  







































 This is a program that started a couple of years ago and it seems there are still a lot of people in the military who aren't aware of it. Please take advantage of this great freebie to see some of the most beautiful places in the US.

 There is a growing and concerted effort to try to allow businesses to exploit the resources of the nation's national parks

 A short list of things Republicans would like to do with our National Parks: open them up to oil and gas drilling and maybe mining; sell off what we can  National Forests, Wildlife Refugees and Wildernesses  to the highest bidder; and, since we cant get rid of the ones we already have, make it so that there are No more National Parks, at all, in the future. Oh, and bring back the plastic water bottles.

  John Wilmshurst, Resource Conservation Manager for one of Canada's most precious natural resources, Jasper National Park, has been fired. 

 Dr. Wilmshurst is the same scientist who was quoted in the Canadian Press around this time last year for his observations regarding the rapid shrinking of the Athabasca Glacier within Jasper National Park.

 If you happen to live in a state that collects a container deposit surcharge when you purchase anything that comes in a can or bottle, you can collect these to earn a bit of extra money. It's the same concept of as recycling the cans and bottles for money, but the container surcharge makes it more profitable. Most states collect a deposit of 5 cents while Michigan collects a deposit of 10 cents. Here are the 11 states that currently pay you when you return bottles and cans to the store:

California - $0.05

Connecticut - $0.05

~~Delaware - $0.05~~

Hawaii - $0.05

Iowa - $0.05

Maine - $0.05

Massachusetts - $0.05

Michigan - $0.10

New York - $0.05

Oregon - $0.05

Vermont - $0.05

While this won't make you a ton of money, it's an easy way to make a bit of money quickly, especially if there is a large event in your area where lots of bottles and cans will be left behind. 














 Do you live in a city that has a Goodwill Outlet in it? (not a regular Goodwill store -- an outlet store). If you do, you should be able to make quite a bit more than that (although you will need to have a small amount to get started -- $20 - $50) -- getting the goods isn't online, but you would be selling them on eBay, so it really is work at home work. 





























 If you need to find a good place to buy things to resell, you need to find the closest Goodwill Outlet Store -- these aren't regular Goodwill stores. These are deeply discounted stores where they usually sell stuff by the pound. It's dirty and you will need to sort through a lot of junk, but you should be able to turn $100 into $500 - $1000 after expenses by reselling stuff on Craigslist and eBay. If you ever wondered where the professional flea market sellers get all the things they sell, it's at the Goodwill Outlet stores.

If you're in college, forget a summer job -- learn this art and you'll make a lot more over the summer, plus you can do it part-time while at school as well (on your own hours). 




 Be very careful -- there are very few things where you can make money without spending time at it.

A big step you need to take is to begin looking for a new job if you hate it. You obviously don't want to quit if you need the money, but that doesn't stop you from looking for something else that pays the same or more that you would enjoy more. That seems like a bigger issue than finding a side income.

If you want to transition a side income job to replace your current income, you'll need to spend time on it. There is no way around that. What you probably need to do is create a list of things you like to do so you can get some idea of what type of side income you'd like to try and create.  




 I think the first question you need to ask is "what do you want to do?" There are plenty of side incomes which can be created. it's also important to know how much you need to make from it. Again, this is why creating a side income before you need it is important because many take some time and effort before you begin to make money from them.

To avoid scams, always research before you give any money. The internet is your friend when it comes to weeding out scams. If there is any pressure that you must spend money now or lose out on teh opportunity, it's a scam...

 This comes from an [article](http://www.poconorecord.com/article/20150716/NEWS/150719569) about the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area which is part of the national park system. I have been seeing more and more graffiti like this in national parks lately, and it's both infuriating and sad.

 I don't know how many times my side incomes have saved me when the unexpected have happened. Creating a way to make money outside your regular income is a lot like a mini insurance policy. If something unexpected happens to your main income, you have another way to earn money right away. it may not be enough to replace your regular income, but it's a hell of a lot better than having zero income coming in. It gives you more time to find a regular job, or it can even become one sometimes. Even if you don't need a side income, it never hurts to create on as an insurance policy.
