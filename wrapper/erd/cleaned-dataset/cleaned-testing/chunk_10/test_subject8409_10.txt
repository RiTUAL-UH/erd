 Trailing dogs tracked the scent from the LKP at Bouck Street and Barker in Dannemora down to the Mobil gas station .9 miles away. From there the scent led them SE on 374 to Cadyville. The direction of travel seemed to be in a general SE direction. E on Route 3 and 374 leads to Plattsburgh, New York. There are RR tracks in Plattsburgh, New York that travel to near Friendship, New York. This makes me suspect they may have hitched a 300 mile ride on a freight car from Plattsburgh to near Friendship.

 There's a big difference between what is written (declassified documents and NYT article), that the U.S. assisted AQI knowing possible consequent's of said actions and your claim that the U.S. invented "ISIS in the first place".. 









 It's worth noting that he steered clear from calling ISIS Takfir, meaning he's possibly still hoping for reconciliation. 




 sounds like "ISIS propaganda"

You mean Iranian.. 




 Why doesn't ISIS address Israel?

ISIS is heavily influenced by the Wahhabi-Salafist doctrine which aims to bring Muslims out of a so-called state of ignorance (jahilliyya). For now their war is primarily against the Takfir who spread Fitna (confusion) within Islam.

 [**Rescission of Cuba as a State Sponsor of Terrorism**](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/05/242986.htm)



#Press Statement

#Jeff Rathke

#Director, Office of Press Relations

#Washington, DC

#May 29, 2015



-

In December 2014, the President instructed the Secretary of State to immediately launch a review of Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, and provide a report to him within six months regarding Cubas support for international terrorism. On April 8, 2015, the Secretary of State completed that review and recommended to the President that Cuba no longer be designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.

-

Accordingly, on April 14, the President submitted to Congress the statutorily required report indicating the Administrations intent to rescind Cubas State Sponsor of Terrorism designation, including the certification that Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the previous six-months; and that Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future. The 45-day Congressional pre-notification period has expired, and the Secretary of State has made the final decision to rescind Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, effective today, May 29, 2015.

-

The rescission of Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism reflects our assessment that Cuba meets the statutory criteria for rescission. While the United States has significant concerns and disagreements with a wide range of Cubas policies and actions, these fall outside the criteria relevant to the rescission of a State Sponsor of Terrorism designation

 **Marilyn Mosby Charges Six Baltimore Police Officers Involved in the Freddie Gray Arrest**

For Immediate Release 5/1/15

Today Marilyn Mosby, States Attorney for Baltimore City, announced charges
against six Baltimore City Police Officers for their alleged role in the death of
Freddie Gray. The States Attorneys Office conducted an independent investigation
into this matter upon receiving notice of the incident. 

The charges with the respective maximum penalties are as follows:

**Officer Caesar R. Goodson, Jr.**

*[Driver of the wagon, checked on Gray several times but never restrained him or sought medical attention when Gray reported that he needed it, according to Mosby.]*

1. Second-degree depraved heart murder (30 yrs.)
2. Manslaughter (involuntary) (10 yrs.) 
3. Assault/second-degree (gross negligence) (10 yrs.) 
4. Manslaughter by vehicle criminal negligence (3 yrs.) 
5. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)

**Officer William G. Porter**

*[Asked Gray at one of the stops if he needed medical attention, according to Mosby. Porter assisted Gray onto a wagon bench, but didn't restrain him or get medical assistance.]*

1. Manslaughter (involuntary) (10 yrs.)
2. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 
3. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)

**Lt. Brian W. Rice**

*[Bike patrol officer who first chased Gray, along with Nero and Miller, according to Mosby. Gray surrendered to them and they arrested him, even though they "failed to establish probable cause" for his arrest. Mosby said no crime had been committed and the knife that Gray was carrying was legal. Rice, Nero and Miller loaded Gray into the police wagon without restraining him; they later placed flex cuffs on his wrists and leg shackles on his ankles, placing him on his stomach, head first in the wagon, without a seatbelt.]*

1. Manslaughter (involuntary) (10 yrs.) 
2. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 
3. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 
4. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)
5. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)
6. False imprisonment (8th Amendment*)

**Officer Edward M. Nero**

*[One of the three officers who pursued Gray. Nero and Miller handcuffed Gray and placed him in a prone position, according to Mosby. When they placed him in a seated position, they discovered a knife. Nero "physically held him down against his will" until a wagon arrived. Nero, along with Rice and Miller, loaded him into the wagon without restraining him; they later placed cuffs on his wrists and leg shackles on his ankles without a seatbelt.]*

1. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 
2. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 
3. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)
4. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)
5. False imprisonment (8th Amendment*)

**Officer Garrett E. Miller**

*[One of the three officers who pursued Gray, arrested and handcuffed him; Miller placed Gray in a restraining technique known as a "leg lace," then was one of three officers who loaded him into the wagon without restraining him, according to Mosby.]*

1. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 
2. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 
3. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)
4. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)
5. False imprisonment (8th Amendment*)

**Sgt. Alicia D. White**

 *[One of three officers who later found Gray unresponsive on the floor of the wagon, according to Mosby. White spoke to the back of his head, but when he didn't respond, she did nothing further "despite the fact that she was advised that he needed a medic," Mosby said. "She made no effort to look or assess or determine his condition. Despite Mr. Gray's seriously deteriorating medical condition, no medical assistance was rendered or summoned for Mr. Gray at that time by any officer."]*

1. Manslaughter (involuntary) (10 yrs.)
2. Assault/second degree (10 yrs.) 
3. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)

*Any sentence that does not constitute cruel   unusual punishment.

MANAMA, Bahrain (NNS) -- The aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71), escorted by the   guided-missile cruiser USS Normandy (CG 60), transited the Strait of Hormuz from its station in the Arabian Gulf to the Arabian Sea, April 19. 

Theodore Roosevelt and Normandy have joined other U.S. forces conducting maritime security operations in the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb and the Southern Red Sea.

In recent days, the U.S. Navy has increased its presence in this area as a result of the current instability in Yemen. 

The purpose of these operations is to ensure the vital shipping lanes in the region remain open and safe. The United States remains committed to its regional partners and to maintaining security in the maritime environment.

**Editorial Reviews**


A World Between is the true story of a young Iranian American raised in the United States, who travels to Iran to discover his father's homeland. His encounters take him across the country, from the teeming capital of Tehran, to the centre of Ancient Persia in Esfahan, and finally to the home of his ancestors Iran's holiest city, Mashhad. In each place we meet his friends and relatives who help form a more representative view of Iranians than we often see in the West. It is the story of one young man's experience, but it speaks volumes to all those who desire to know the place better, both westerners and Iranians living abroad. We see Iran through the narrator's eyes, that understands both Iranian and American sensibilities.

 The odds are much less. You forget to factor the higher infant mortality rates in multiples..

The risk of infant death increases with the increasing number of
infants in the pregnancy. In 2010, the infant mortality rate for twins
(24.03) was more than four times the rate for single births (5.45). The
infant mortality rate for triplets (55.31) was 10 times, and the rate for
quadruplets (115.02) was 21 times, the rate for single births. An infant
mortality rate could not be computed for quintuplet or higher-order
births due to the small number of events in that category.

 I'll shoot them an email and see if I get a response. 




 This is the description for a very similar photo at the Library of Congress.

I'm quite certain it's the same event.

That's not an explanation..

A multi-sensor camera systems with video analytic software could easily detect such threats at great distances.

Coincidentally [SpotterRF just announced today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37gpbn2MG-M) a Mobile Radar System that detects and tracks small drones. It seems they can be tracked with ground surveillance radar but at limited distance. Plextek [also has a system](http://www.plextek.com/about-us/press/press-releases/745-press-article-59.html). I'm sure there are many others on the market.

I wonder if such systems are installed at the White House and if not why. 









 Notice the young boy center left. He looks out of place.  




 It's a crazy idea. Just yesterday most major news outlets had articles on how new aircrafts with WiFi can be hacked.

 I later found [another online copy ](http://www.baynews9.com/content/dam/news/static/cfnews13/documents/2015/4/cuba-recission-041415.pdf) in TimesNewRomanPSMT font.  

It's possible the source that leaked the text switched the font from TimesNewRomanPSMT to Courier New to give it an "official" look. IDK

Side Note: It's now on the [WhiteHouse's website]( https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/04/14/message-congress-report-congress-respect-proposed-rescission-cubas-desig).

 




 Interesting.

 Peace.
