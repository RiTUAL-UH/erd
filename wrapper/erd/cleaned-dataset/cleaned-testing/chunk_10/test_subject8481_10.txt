 Sweet, tangy or spicy? They had all three.  




 Blue Door Smokehouse in Lexington, KY.  




 Potato salad.  









 I know my fish monger well and told him that we were making sushi. Before preparing the fish I always place it in the freezer for at least 15 minutes to kill any parasites.  




 My local fish monger does a great job. Since  I'm not on the west coast I'm pretty sure that it was flash frozen at one point, but I'm not sure.  




 They're a tartare mixture, one with tuna the other with salmon. They have a little fish roe, Japanese mayo and some crunchy tempura bits. We would have added some scallions if we'd had any. The only reason they're not sitting on rice is because we ran out.  









 I can't believe I just watched the whole thing, but that was a great video.  Thanks! 




 I'm not planning to upgrade the portrait lens at this point. The results from that, little inexpensive lens are astounding.  Really I'm looking for a telephoto lens and potentially a wide angle. 




 The biggest thing that I'm lacking is zoom.  My kids are getting older and I need to be able to take some sport action shots from a distance.

I'm currently using the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 portrait lens quite a bit, but I do use the 18-55mm when I need it.
