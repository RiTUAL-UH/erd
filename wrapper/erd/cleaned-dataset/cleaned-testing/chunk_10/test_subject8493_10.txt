 12VPN or PandaPow 




 I'm not quite sure how this constitutes "self-awareness" since the robots were responding to pre-programmed conditions ("attempt speech", "listen to oneself", "process speech", "take appropriate action")?  









 I gave up on Astrill long ago  




 They won't be able to solve it in all cities but they will in the cities that matter - Beijing, Shanghai, etc. Hebei, Shandong, Jilin etc are not a priority--too poor. Smog used to be terrible in LA but the gov managed to clean it up.  




 Python has more libs.
Ruby is more fun.  




 Thank you, and your volunteers, for your selfless giving. 
Are you primarily funded through individual donors, or institutional/corporate donations? How much does fundraising take away from the clinic work and how do you resolve that issue? 




 No "a" either :) 




 Sounds like you need a new bank and insurer 




 It's incremental innovation, which is not the same as breaking new ground, but useful nonetheless. 
Wechat started out copying whatsapp, but it's now arguably miles ahead, especially with micropayments  




 Stick deodorant literally does not exist in China, even in Beijing.  




 Your nexus will be fine. Just use VPN for Google Play and other services. I recommend 12VPN over Astrill. 
Oh, and get Pleco as your dictionary app.  




 I second that last comment.  
China can be a great experience with a positive attitude; most of all, the people are very nice - especially in the northeast where you are going. Gruff on the surface but great friends once you get to know them. Take every opportunity to mingle and spend time with people. 
Also, be on guard that employers  will try to use you, so don't be afraid to politely stand firm when you feel it's necessary.  




 - I disagree about the driving, at least here in Beijing. In small rural towns though, yeah anything goes. 
- in my experience, internet speeds are generally good with a VPN, though it does slow down sometimes  




 Sorry, but you'll have to rephrase the question.  




 Ah, the English... 




 I agree about "2 China's ". But both are the "real" China - one old, one new.  




 Ignore the negative reddishit; if you come with a positive attitude and a true desire to educate as well as learn yourself, you'll do great. Rural China might be tougher than you expect in terms of living conditions. I would start in the city.  




 ^this. Be prepared for a lot of bureaucratic BS and lack of organization and communication and morals (judging by western standards). If you can roll with that and not let it get to you, you'll be fine.  




 +1 for Yunnan if you're going 2-3 tier. 
 




 Your part 1 will no longer work in Beijing. They've cracked down on that  




 Many, many English language schools in China hire non-native speakers, especially if they are Caucasian. Appearances first! :)

 I don't think political reforms are in the cards
