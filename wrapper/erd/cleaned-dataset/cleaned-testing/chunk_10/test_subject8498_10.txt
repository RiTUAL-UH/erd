 Entre ir, instalar y volver me lleva 2 horas de mi tiempo hacerlo, y adems le cobro el trabajo **bien** hecho. Ella pago 200 al local ese y termin con lo que termin.  

Por tu comment veo que hay ms gente con esa mentalidad de la que pensaba. 




 Si, ya s que si quera agarrar el laburo le tena que recordar eso, pero la verdad ya a esta altura me embola andar pensando por el resto de la gente, prefer que se jodiese sola por rata y boluda. 




 Labur un tiempo en un estudio de fotografa del cual me termin yendo porque eran muy, muy ratas.  

La duea saba que yo arreglaba PCs adems de sacar fotos, porque figura en mi CV, entonces un da me llama para arreglar 3 PCs del estudio. Voy, y tenan instalado cualquier SO (esos Windows Titanium o Gladiatus o no se cmo mierda se llaman), todos los soft de edicin crackeados como el orto, 20 mil toolbars, etc etc. 

Estuve un da entero poniendole las 3 PCs a punto y mientras ella me contaba que las haba mandado a hacer y a arreglar a un local de por ac, que le haban cobrado cualquier cosa siempre, que la haban re cagado porque las PCs andaban mal, etc etc etc. Se las dej andando 10/10, un SO como la gente, estable, todo bien crackeado, le hice particiones en los discos, nada del otro mundo pero se las dej bien. La mina me escribi a la semana para decirme que estaba feliz con el laburo, que era la primera vez que alguien no la haba cagado con las PCs, todo muy copado. 


Fast forward 2 meses a hace una semana, me enva "cunto me cobrs por instalarme el Lightroom y el Photoshop en una PC nueva?", le contesto que si son slo esos dos programas le cobro $300. Me contesta "Ah, en [Nombre del local donde la cagaron] me cobran $200" a lo cual le contesto "Bueno, fijate y avisame". Qu hace la mina? Va y lo lleva a ese local. Una vez ms le instalan todo como el orto, le hacen pija la PC con virus, y entre idas y vueltas se termina quemando 500 mangos. Me manda ahora un mensaje diciendome si puedo ir a arreglarle la PC... A lo que le contest que no tengo tiempo porque estoy ocupadsimo. No voy a moverme de nuevo y a arreglar cagadas, que se joda por rata, por boluda, y por no poner $100 ms desde un principio sabiendo que el laburo se lo haca bien.  

Hay gente muy pelotuda. 




 We definitely need vargas in this thread. 









  That is just what happens in movies.

To add my two cents, a fact that they always insist on getting wrong in the movies is the use of a defibrillator. They show it as a way to resuscitate someone's stopped heart but that's not it's function at all; desfibrillators are used to return a dysrhythmia (ventricular fibrillation to be precise) to normal sinus rythm, not to restart a heart.

 Time is definitely a dimension in our universe. We invented a way to measure it just as we invented ways to measure space, like counting in in meters, miles, or light years. We invented seconds, minutes, years etc for measuring time, but we know for a fact it's there as a dimension because of Relativity and time dilation effects at different speeds or gravity. 




 The only thing that bothers me is when the language is super mispronounced in characters that should speak it fluently. Quick example, Breaking Bad is one of the best series I've ever seen, but as a native Spanish speaker it really bothered me how Gus Fring spoke that language given that it was a chilean born and raised character. Maybe he's referring to something like this? I don't understand any other language other than English in that movie so I wouldn't know 




 Right on point. If you break a limb, better be an arm. Walking with a broken leg for months is a fucking pain in the ass. But if you ever lose a limb, better be a leg. Amazing prosthetics for legs, not so much for arms (there are awesome prosthetics for them but given the use we give to hands they just don't accomplish the same level of utility).

 Spanish is my native language and I felt this was fake for this exact same reason. "My father is very bad man". We don't say "mi padre es hombre muy malo", we say " mi padre es **un** hombre muy malo" (my father is **a** very bad man).  

Those fake mistakes can be found in the majority of his speech, it sounds super forced. I just don't buy it. Nice reaction from /r/legaladvice though, when something like this gets posted you just have to give your best advice just in case it's real, you never know.

 Wow, that's awesome man! Definitely submit it to the page. 




 I'd say I saw this a couple of years ago, but I can't quite remember. He's definitely super interesting and talks very clearly about the subject.  

And what I love about him is that he sounds so genuine about his enlightment and his point of view about the reality, he speaks of it so enthusiastically that you just *know* he's not selling bullshit, he speaks from his heart 100%. I love this guy.

 I believe a helpful measure would be to remove to option to vote or comment when you're in "np" links (no participation). I never posted in SRS but I know for a fact that /r/bestof and SRD requires you to post in np.reddit.com/r/[link] shape, or else it removes your post.  

Yes, you can always delete the np. part and downvote anyway, but in the meantime while they think for a better solution I think this helps a lot, specially on mobile apps where you just won't exit the thread, enter the subreddit, go to the thread, search the comment, and downvote it.

 Thanks a lot! Definitely the clothes bring up the eyes, maybe even a little too much as you say. I'll take the advice for next editions for sure. Thanks for commenting! 




 [**Here's the video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-IWRd3YKoc) I just uploaded with a timelapse of this colorization.  

I discovered this amazing subreddit a few days ago and instantly subscribed, I absolutely love the photos posted here. Please tell me where do you think I can improve and tips, and what do you think looks good, it would be of great help!

 









 Agree. I absolutely get the point in sharing something it isn't OC that caught your attention in any way. I can't however see the point in calling it your own, what the fuck is up with lying like that? 




 I had a stroke

:^) 




 Doctor! Do you concur?!

 Just to contribute with my two cents; OP, maybe you've heard that information in the universe can't spread faster than the speed of light (that would violate some pretty essential bases of Relativity). If we were to obscure light sources such as in your example and see them instantly 100 million light years away, we could communicate and therefore transmit information instantly, which is infinitely faster than the speed of light! It would be awesome but alas, it can't happen on this particular Universe :( 




 Dx 




 Yeah. [You can clearly see movie posters in the background]( http://images.goodfood.com.au/2015/03/09/6333190/Article%20Lead%20-%20wide6712561413yr7jimage.related.articleLeadwide.729x410.13yqge.png1426303660041.jpg-620x349.jpg). Besides there's nobody dancing on neither those pictures, and if you look at the detail in the background and context it's more like people going in or out of the cinema than a dance floor. 




 I think that would be interesting but honestly I see it too much of a stretch. Nice theory though 




 Buenos Aires. "Gil" dicho al verre es logi. 




 Here in Argentina "logi" is slang for "idiot". I'm not calling my mouse an idiot.

 As a Jaden Smith fan I death it. 




 Absolutely. It also resembles a lot that "things changing into other things and being made of infinite stuff" feeling that happens and you just can't find the words to describe.  




 I watched brba entirely stoned the second time. Fuck me, it was incredibly awesome. One of my fondest memories is that scene where Walt goes to that junkie and his badass partner says "Stay out of my territory". Everything about that scene just screams fucking epic, the music, the acting, the build up, the fact that is the final scene of that episode... everything on weed seems 10 times more awesome, that scene left me speachless, I couldn't believe the level of what I was watching   


BTW awesome video, OP, very very well done 




 I don't even get why this is a thing. [He says "ear**th**" super clearly.](https://youtu.be/OfPWpEKhgfk)
