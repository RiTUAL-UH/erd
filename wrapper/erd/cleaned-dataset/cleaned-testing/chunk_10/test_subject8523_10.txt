 Are you going to go international one day?
If so tell us about some of the first places you'd like to tour
 




 Hi everyone, my 6L6WGB (by electron tubes) have died on me and I've found a pair of matched 6L6GC (by electron tube)
Would I need to get my amp re biased or would I be able to just plug n play? 




 Not the biggest Zero fan, but when Ito pulled out MK over diddy so Zero responded with Falcon, pure class on Zero's part  




 Also if you guys have any good recommendations on what brand to go for that would be outstanding   




 Thanks alot! really appreciate it  




 Hi guys not sure if this is the correct place to post? but I have a Jet city 50W head and my power tubes have died they are "electron tube" 6L6WGB tubes, Do i need to get identical tubes? or just another set of 6L6 tubes, or 6L6WGB tubes? 
All help is appreciated guys :D 









 Bring an umbrella, even if it's a lovely sunny day, be prepared, Melbourne weather is an emotion unstable girl  




 Uhm, OP does realize that the F1 is shown on the free to air channels right? not only that but in glorious live 1080 




 What are some of your favorite and most despised levels within the entire series guys!? 
Expo center reception (SF1) or Murukawa tower (SFOS)
Are tied for me
without a doubt Convoy in SF3 for the worst
