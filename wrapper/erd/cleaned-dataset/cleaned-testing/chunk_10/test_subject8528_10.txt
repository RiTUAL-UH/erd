 I finished **The Martian, by Andy Weir** which I thought was really good, but some aspects dragged on throughout the book. (The fact that is was originally a serial is apparent)

I just started the first of the Mistborn series **The Final Empire, by Brandon Sanderson**, since I'd seen it recommended so much on Reddit, and this is shaping up to being one compelling read. The only off putting thing was trying to get started as it throws the reader into the thick of it without defining some of the terms such as "skaa". 




 Well, the library used to be a giant fiction section that was sorted by the first three letters of the author's last name. (ie. James Patterson would be in FIC PAT) 




 The reason I am asking is that my mother is an elementary media specialist and I was curious as to what you all thought about libraries doing that.

This also raised some question as to where certain books go as there was some question as to whether or not to split SciFi and Fantasy since SciFi is, for the most part, futuristic fantasy.

 Quoting from a MyAnimeList thread about it:

 By order of release date:

Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki

Tenchi Muyo! Mihoshi Special

Tenchi Universe

Tenchi in Tokyo

Tenchi Muyo! GXP

The first two are ova's (Original video animation) if you want you could just start at Tenchi Universe and you'll be fine.

As for where to watch it, I think Funimation has the license to the series but I don't know if they have it on their website. 




 Did anyone else catch that Zen was reading in the wrong direction? The book Shirayuki left is, based on the cover, meant to be read from left to right. Thing is, Zen was flipping the pages going towards the cover. (Books in Japan are right to left rather than L-R) 




 It is a mess. It was good for about wo years and then the leadership changed. They took what used to be a fun club where people would poke fun at the characters and situations to a club where you cannot talk or do anything fun.

I found that the university has more people who watch anime than go to the club and they are more fun to hang out with. 

Similar to the experiences shared within, the club seems to be getting creepier and creepier each year. (Thankfully it hasn't gotten to the stage of people bringing in dakimakuras and what not) 




 It is kinda funny, it is almost like people in the class knew that the class rep was an alien as they call her "the iron lady" and the truth of the matter is that she is controlling a metal shell. 




 Well they are weird, if you look into it. They not only do video games but they are also a book publisher as well in Japan. (Well, they publish manga but still.) [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Enix#Other_media), look at the second paragraph. 




 I know this is a month old, but I finally got around to reading *The Martian* over the course of two days it was really good and thank you for the recommendation! I haven't gotten to the others yet, but I will. 




 No, he did twenty (20). 




 One of the higher up executives also mentioned it by name during SE's E3 press conference so that was pretty cool to see. 




 [Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20141021201922/http://8ths.in/fantranslation-guide/) is one from 8thSin Translations who was known for reviewing various fansubs for their translations, typesetting, readibility and what not. Sadly the site is down but the Wayback Machine has a copy of it with the example images.

 SHAME

 It is the process of using a soldering iron (ie. A device that gets extremely hot) and melting solder (a thin piece of metal with a lower melting point) in order to make, or fix, a permanent connection. 

You can find the iron and solder in stores like RadioShack. (If they are still around in your area) 




 Well, that is what it is in the English release. 




 I think it is when you create/cause a play to occur resulting in a goal. (ex. You angle the ball off a wall and a teammate then sends the ball into the goal) 




 I'd like to see a "Buzzer Beater" bonus that gives extra xp for scoring a goal after the clock gets to 0:00. 

The reason for this is that it is rare enough to warrant recognition but it would need to be enough xp to be nice but not force people to wait until the last literal second.  




 Bonuses as in things such as "Save", "Shot on Goal", "Playmaker", and such. 




 The video, mainly, features this [fanart.](https://i.imgur.com/kF1knni.jpg) 




 Bells? Could I trade you a bug for some? ^^^\(Wait, ^^^wrong ^^^game...) 




 Well, Evangelion has been mentioned by name in western cinema before back in the movie, "One Hour Photo". [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5FmFaK7pMU) is the scene in question.

Granted, having them move and fight would be more than a single scene where they show an action figure of one of the mechs. 




 What about an option for both? 




 If you are a college student, or have access to a .edu email, you can get Prime for $49 a year instead of the $99 price. 




 Yeah, I believe that him turning around in mid-air like that is intentional given his prior experience. 




 I agree that Rocket League is really watchable as, over the past week it has been out, I have been watching a lot of it on Twitch and I'm someone who almost never watches stuff on Twitch.

Since you mentioned Krovovi, [here is a montage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI1xuE6OUuU) of his plays from the second beta of Rocket League. The reason that he is so good at RL is that he played a lot of Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars back on the PS3. 




 You drive as fast going backwards as going forwards, couple this with some double jump backflips and you can move pretty quickly from midfield. The only thing you don't have is the ability to boost. 




 There is a tutorial, all the way up to All-Star difficulty of solely aerial kicks/hits. (Along with striker and goalie training) 









 Yep, on a number of occasions I've had to demolish the goalie in order for my team to score. Unlike some others, it seems to be quite effective and after a few times they just give up. 




 This one is harder in the west as there isn't a legal source to get it as of July 12, 2015. People would have to pirate it to watch it. I wish CR would pick it up, but odds are that won't happen. 




 Yep, of sorts. Japanese has three scripts:

* Hiragana -  (Used for simple sentences, as hints/helpers for reading kanji in some publications, and as particles)

* Katakana -  (Mainly used for foreign words.  = America)

* Kanji - (These are, basically, Chinese characters and they are the more difficult part of the language. To read proficiently, you'd need to know 2000+ characters) 




 I wasn't trying to insinuate that ball cam was better than the normal view, but that changing the camera angle from -5 to -10 helped a lot. 

To summarize, by doing do I'm able to:

* See the positioning of the car while the ball is above me

* I tend to hit the ball more than with the angle at -5 while in ball cam

* Playing a few rounds with it online I have done quite well. 




 It was back in May of 2014 and it was coinciding with the release of the third movie. (Rebellion) 




 I think that Sega will, some day, turn to only doing mobile and arcade games. The arcade is still popular in Japan and Sega has their own [chain](https://i.imgur.com/Nw8CrNT.jpg) of [them](https://i.imgur.com/C6JjwIR.jpg) while smartphones and mobile games are popular not only there but around the world.

Photo Source: First one is of the Akihabara locations while the second is the one near Tokyo Dome City. (I took them both while I was over there) 




 I was playing earlier today and I decided to fiddle with the camera settings to see if I could improve the view while playing in ball mode. 

I found, so far, that leaving everything default but changing the angle from -5 to -10 vastly improved my play and it was easier to line up shots. What this does is make it so that the camera, even on kickoff with the ball all the way up in the air, shows the back of the car which give you the position and orientation of the car compared to the ball. While it, slightly, limits the view on the normal camera mode it isn't drastic enough to change back to the old setting.


For some anecdotal evidence,  I took this online in 3v3s, and we were able to go 8-0 with myself getting 4 goals. I do not consider myself to be that good of a player, but I have noticed an improvement. Whether this is consistent is left to further testing. 




 Try listening to the soundtrack now, it will hurt. It will hurt in a few months as well. 




 Thankfully, unlike **a certain** series, their powers are imperfect. (can't choose when to stop, can only use it for 5 seconds at a time, etc...) 




 Amazon.co.jp would also work for imports and they do have an toggle-able English interface.  




 Yep, I said, "...would change the setting so it is a held option." 




 I know in SARPBC the ball cam was a held, rather than toggle-able, option so I imagine those who are really good at it now who used to play the original would change the setting so it is a held option. 

Odds are, they use it as a situational view rather than always having it on. 




 I feel like this is closer to people using the ball cam view when the ball is above them. 




 Odds are, this was taken after 1AM on Zalarea. The server tends to die out for the night as people on the East coast go to bed. 




 What would be even funnier is if the VA of Nashetania was allergic to carrots much like Mel Blanc. (The voice of Bugs Bunny and he was, ironically, allergic to carrots.) 




 What would be their version of the Roadrunner? Nichijou? 




 Actual ramen is quite good, and there are a number of varieties out there as well. 




 Thing is, the lossless streaming is unnoticeable unless you have the top of the line headphones and DACs.

I, personally, have the Sennheiser HD650's and the AudioEngineD1 DAC and I cannot tell the difference between MP3s at 320kbps or the 1000kb+ FLACs I have. 




 If you want to be in people's good graces, click on the enemies like that one and type: /sh  lt;t is at  lt;pos! 

What this does is shout (ie. Map-wide message) that  lt;t (aka. Your target) is at  lt;pos (your current position). The reason this helps is that people who are at higher levels, or even endgame, need/want them to get seals which are used for endgame gear. 




 Rather than delete the VM, set it up and create an image of said VM then just reinstall it. 




 It is from an anime-inspired series created by the guys who did "Red vs. Blue" called "R W B Y" 




 I remember from some of the earlier digital fan subs of series wherein they would ask people to stop distributing it should it be licensed in the US. I guess that is a tradition that came over from the VHS era. 




 Either that or someone, like myself, who likes to watch, "How Its Made". 




 130k does diddily squat around the DC area as the cost of living is insane. (Rent for a condo starting at $1250 a month) 




 Someone was translating it and they were going at a good pace, but real life caught up them and they had to abandon the project. 

I think all August games are doomed to be dropped and never fully translated. (Yoake Mae has been sitting at 100% TL'd for months, Fortune Arterial's last update was in 2013, Aiyoku no Eustia died when Yandere Translations fell off the face of the Earth)
 




 Possible shows:

* http://myanimelist.net/anime/8557/Shinryaku!_Ika_Musume

* http://myanimelist.net/anime/9379/Denpa_Onna_to_Seishun_Otoko (Maybe an alien?) - This is probably it.

* http://myanimelist.net/anime/10578/C%C2%B3 




 Neither does the Realta Nua version of F/SN. 




 That is crazy considering that TypeMoon allowed Fate/Unlimited Codes and Fate/Extra to be released in the US. While they are spin-offs, it is still in the F/__ universe. 




 Tell him to come back for the last 6 minutes! 




 If you listen, you can hear the wind rustling during some of the scenes prior to the reveal. 




 Trust me, this is one of the first shows that take a SoL show and turn it on the audience's expectations. 




 No problem! It was the first one that came to find when you described it. 




 Clannad and Clannad ~After Story~ for sure. (Please be aware that Clannad is slow to start but it will definitely cause him to think about his life.)  




 You are thinking of "[The Girl Who Leapt Through Space](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5307/Sora_wo_Kakeru_Shoujo)". 




 Think about it, earthbenders could outright break any bone in the body as they are made up of, mainly, calcium and carbon! 




 It is one of the randomly selected phrases when they return from a venture. 




 Virus is the one of the few times I can see a macro in a PUG. (I'm fine with funny macros if it is with FC members and friends) 




 You also might want to spell correctly; as doing so will create a better impression of you to the reader. Punctuation might help as well. 




 It takes time and money to make games, or anything for that matter. Most of the free games, whether or not they are on Steam, are passion projects and something the developer did in their spare time. (a la Cave Story or [Narcissu](http://store.steampowered.com/app/264380/)) Some free games are made to purposefully grow a community such as Trackmania: Nations. (It used to be completely F2P, but an update limited the time that people could play for free before having to sit out a round.) 




 Force a random person to have to make a choice between two horrible options at random times to watch the ensuing chaos.  




 Thanks. As for the multiplayer, it is the same population as there is cross platform multiplayer. 




 It is like that because they way the room is, the A/C and heating unit is blocking easy access to moving my chair. The TV itself is up on a dresser and a ways in because I have to fit my PS4 up there as well and I don't want it to fall off.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/ex2bvzZ.png) is a hastily drawn and labeled layout of my dorm room. The blank hallway is where the entrance is. While I could move the chair back, the viewing angle suck as the dresser and desk combination limits it. 




 I was asking because when I am away at college, my PS4 is hooked up to a small TV as my dorm room doesn't have that much space, but in order to see it I'd have to be 8-10 feet away from the screen. Due to that, I barely touch my PS4 during the school year.

I was, basically, wondering whether or not people felt as though it was worthwhile for me to get it on the PC as well due to that fact. (If I'm on my laptop, I am a lot closer to the screen.) 




 **Please read before commenting.**

I am debating on whether or not to get Rocket League on PC.I own a PS4 and I do have PS+, but when I am away at college I barely touch my console as it is easier to play on the PC. (17in laptop vs A 19in TV from 8-10 feet away)

As such, I am debating on whether or not to get Rocket League on the PC. I played quite a bit of SARPBC back on the PS3 so I'd definitely get the PS4 version, regardless, since it is part of PS+.

 Heavensward isn't like other MMO expansions where people could jump into the new content instantly.

In HW, you have to complete the main story quest all the way through the 2.55 update of content. It will take you anywhere from 70-150 hours to complete this content. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3bheg1/guide_to_catching_up_to_patch_30_heavensward/) is a good, spoiler free, guide as to what you have and can do to catch up to where heavensward begins.

Do not worry about your friends being at the endgame level right now as you'd catch up soon enough. That and they'd still get a good amount of exp from helping you progress through the required dungeons and what not. 




 ~~Do you happen to know where I could buy the piano arrange album? (It isn't on the US iTunes like the rest of Key's stuff, same with the Million Star single album)~~

Dang it, it seems as though the album was only as a bonus for the first press of the Angel Beats VN. Here's to hoping that Sekai will license and release the game and include the album. 




 Be aware that Eden of the East has some references to a male's genitals in the first episode and such. (While it is a great show, this may be a deal breaker for you until she is older.)

As for the source for these shows, look on Funimation or Crunchyroll. While a lot of people do pirate anime, it is not advisable to publicly discuss it.

(I **will** remove any and all references to illegal downloading and streaming sites. Sorry, but I have to do it as a moderator.) 




 /r/hailcorporate 




 Well, if you set Lisma Lominsa as your free location (if you use the one-time password system on the PC) it is worth it in order to get over to Horizon quickly. 

On some servers it is easy to make gil while others, such as Zalarea, have had their markets crash over the past few months. (IV materia is going for ~3-7k gil) 




 You can cancel the animation by doing another skill. (This is where off-GCD skills come into play) 




 Yep. You'll find out later who and why they did what they did there in the OP. 




 Rather than teleport to Horizon, TP to Lisma Lominsa Lower Decks and take the aethernet shard to the Archanist's Guild, from there go west and take the ferry. It might be cheaper than directly teleporting. 




 The Japanese, when transliterated from the hiragana is, "nya nya nyan nyan". You might recognize "nyan" because of "Nyan Cat" which was popular a few years ago. Also, "nya/nyan" is their version of a cat meowing.

/u/smokeshack typed the hiragana wrong as you have to hit "n" twice to write "" which is "n" in Japanese. The reason for this is that there are characters with "a,i,u,e,o" after an "n". ( ,  ,  , , respectively) 




 Yeah, that is me. I decided to forgo my old username as I am getting older. (Heck, I'm 21 now) 




 Yep. The go off of the base class, not the job. (This is why you see it as getting Warrior exp while playing PLD and so on.) 




 100k for a professionally produced song isn't much. Heck, I've got a crappily recorded video of using a PSP as a PS3 controller that has over 300k views. 

It is sad that a, at the time, 14 year-old's video would have more views than a one hit wonder music artist. 




 That was from a level 55 MSQ. (I know it since I just saw it) 




 The, kupo. 




 Thank you for doing these! I've downloaded a number of them but 99% of the time my phone is on vibrate. :(

Would it be possible for you to do the [OP for Clannad](https://youtu.be/Q2HmP6Sl5RQ)? 




 The only thing was the Sekai allowed the group who is looking into localizing MuvLuv a little bit of time during SP's Anime Expo panel to announce it and give a few more details. 




 The ??? is Anime Planet. 




 Yeah, it does seem a bit off. I think the fact that the episode is broken out into skits rather than being combined together in a more seamless manner is causing it. It stems from the source as Working is a 4-koma manga rather than a continuous format. This means that the situations and characters are expressed within something akin to a comic strip which creates a natural pause for the reader.

I believe that the original director had a better grasp on how to alleviate the skit-esque feeling when adapting the previous two seasons of Working. 




 Look at the third chapter, that is where I noticed the gore ramping up. 




 How about this? Scrap WM, and make it so that BRD players can choose whether or not to cast it. 

Have it so a tap, or click, of the skill does the normal skill but holding the skill causes it to cast with a 25% damage bonus. This would create more of a skill based system and it would allow the freedom and flexibility without being clunky.

(This has a basis in reality as archers could either fire fast for effect or line up their shot, thereby taking longer, for increased damage)  




 Thing is, back then, cutscenes were not rendered in game but as a video. (ie. Squaresoft made a video with the characters and then had the game call said video at that point in time.) 




 I know, haven't they heard the news? They're an amazon showroom now. (Though they will now match the price if amazon sells it.) 




 It seemed like this month's video was a bit more off the cuff rather than the usual, thought out, monthly video which lent itself to it not feeling "right". Odds are this is due to them prepping for the upcoming conventions with Anime Expo in California and Otacon in Maryland. 




 I'm not the guy who made the original, but [here is a much larger version of the image](http://i.imgur.com/5OcatP9.jpg). You could use this as a wallpaper.

I ran the original through the Waifu2x-caffe program and had it scale the image to 4x the original size. (This looks a lot better than other resizing algorithms as it is actually recreating the original image through the training of a neural network based on line art and things of that nature.) 




 Dang it, now I can't see anything else. 




 I wish they had added that the PS3 startup sound is actually that of an [orchestra tuning.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfSH1ezevjM) 




 Actually, the camera isn't used when using the gamepad to allow Wii games. There is an IR LED on each side of the camera which creates the sensor bar for the wiimote. (This is also why you can use two candles spaced away from each other since a flame produces infrared light)  




 I am not affiliated with Random Curiosity, but I used to use the site before finding out about reddit. I still go back every season to read the previews as it has been the best way, that I have found, to find out more about the upcoming shows as they give their thoughts and compile all known promotional videos together. 









 We need the salt, there are too many times where this would be perfect. 




 They toned down the manga's artstyle, as the chins and faces are really pointy in the manga. 




 Have people race the same track multiple times and give the replays to the person compiling them into a video. Trackmania has the ability to display thousands of replays at a single time with custom camera angles and everything. 




 Could you please mark that as spoilers as the trailer nor the promotional art say anything in that regard? 




 This is stupid, I get doing so if the apps were calling for people to go out and do horrible deeds, but to completely remove apps where it is used in a historical context is getting to the point of whitewashing history and it could stand for more ramifications in the long run.

 **NOTE:** US only! Also, residents of AR, CO, ME, MO, RI and VT are ineligible to receive Amazon Prime referral credit.

Amazon, currently, have two different sets of referring going on. The first is for **Amazon Student**, which is Prime geared towards college students. 

---

**What is Amazon Student?**

It is basically Amazon Prime, but for college students. Also, rather than costing $99 a year, it is $49 and has all of the benefits. You can get a six month free trial without the streaming video, music and the kindle lending library.

**What do I need to be able to sign up for Amazon student?**

You need a .edu email address and you must give your school (college/university) along with your year and intended date of graduation (Month/Year). 


**What if I am not a student?**

This is the second program for **regular people** where if people use your link to sign up, you earn a $5 credit for each person. This would be great to share with an audience that could benefit from having Amazon Prime. They can get a 30-day trial for free.

**What are the benefits of Amazon Prime?**

* Free 2 day shipping on **any** Amazon fulfilled order.
* Free release date shipping on video games and others. (*Only through Amazon Student*)
* Instant streaming of movies and TV shows. (Only available when you pay for it. Not on the trial.)
* Streaming music through Amazon Music.
* You can borrow one book a month for the Kindle.
* Unlimited photo storage on Amazon Cloud Services (Photography businesses cannot use this)

**How is this related to /r/digitalmarketing?**
---
Right now, each person you refer nets you credit on Amazon that is similar to a gift card. (Sadly, you can only use it on items directly sold by Amazon rather than through a third party seller.)


How much do I earn per referral?

Audience | Referral Amount
---|---
College Students | $10 per person
Regular People | $5 per person

**Why am I sharing this here?** 

In part to help myself, but also to give another avenue for those who have access to either a college aged audience or an audience that would be receptive to such a thing. (Think forums for parents, or other places in which people would be susceptible to sign up for Amazon Prime.)

 




 I agree that it can be annoying, but there are ways about doing it in which it isn't in your face so much.

The last time I posted about this program was three years ago. 




 Yeah, but even affiliate marketing can become a source of beermoney if done in smaller quantities; which referring Prime could lend itself to as you cannot put your credits in the bank. 

I checked the rules and such to see if it wasn't allowed, but I didn't see anything.  









 Japanese has katakana which is, mainly, used to denote foreign words and provide a phonetic basis to the words. For example, cake in Japanese is  (Ke i ki) and another example is America in Japanese is  (A me ri ka). They do not have a "C" so "K"'is used instead. I believe that some, or most, of the names of items and such are written in katakana and then phonetically translated into English.

EDIT: Fixed the katakana for cake. Thanks /u/zhv. 




 It won't be on the ancient version of Android for much longer as someone is looking at bringing Android 4.4, through Cyanogenmod 11, to the NST.

Source: http://forum.xda-developers.com/nook-touch/development/rd-nst-future-cm11-twrp-t3075458
 




 That may be the case, but I meant that OP already has an android tablet but may not know it.

No e-ink readers have a backlight. The ones that have lights do so from the side and on top of the e-ink layer. 




 OP could also just root their NST and install the google play books app since the NST is, basically, an android tablet. 




 It is great on the PC due to no ads a d the higher quality streaming. 




 Sadly it has only been translated into Spanish and there are 18 chapters available in that language on the usual site. 




 The light novels are available in English from your local bookstore or online. Season 1 covered volumes one and two while season two covered volumes three and five.

They are really good reads and they go well beyond what the anime showed us. 




 Considering that it wasn't leaked at all, my guess is that he was the only one who had access to it. (Loose lips sink ships sort of deal.) 




 Who knows, the vita might even be able to run Gamecube games. They've been able to get it running on Android tablets so who knows? 




 3.0 does as well, some of the side quests' names over in Falcon's Nest are still in Japanese. I've also gotten the programming name of an item while doing a story quest in the game place. (ie, it was something like: "iname ____ :  ______" where the first blank was something in katakana, too quick for me to read it, and the second blank was more information. 




 Good grief.
