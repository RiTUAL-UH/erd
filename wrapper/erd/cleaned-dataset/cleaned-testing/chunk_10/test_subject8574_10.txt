 r/creativewriting hope I typed it out right. It's around 2'500 people subscribed there, but I think it's a good place to share with others and get some feedback. Cheers! 




 I like this, but I think I would like this even better on a different subreddit. It sounds to like an epic tale about a crime fighting cat is about to begin, and that very fact is quite awesome indeed, but I would find, personally, that this would be more well received on a different subreddit, friend. Just letting you know ;]  




 Every night I hear something howling outside my window, but I guess it would be better described as a wail. It starts off booming and loud until it shatters into high-pitched screeches, kinda like fingernails on a chalk board. It scared me every single night before I went to bed. After much debate, I decided to go outside and find out exactly what this awful sound originated from. With only a flash night and a couple batteries, I descended into the dark forest.

I'd say it was about thirty minutes of hiking aimlessly before I heard it, the booming wail.

It was loud, indicating that it, whatever it was, was near. I, now hearing it from this close, did not want to stick around in order to find out exactly what it was. I ran. The bushes and twigs I made my way through snapped and rustled violently, loudly. I ran till I found I had no more air in my lungs. Huffing, I could hear the queasy sound of my breathing. After I was able to breath somewhat normal, I took a look around and found that I was lost. "Shit!" I cried. I was so frustrated that I was lost in the dark scary woods. But in a matter of a second, everything became undyingly terrifying as I heard the sound of bushes from afar rustle. Something was coming, and it was coming quickly. Unfortunately I didn't get to see what it was before this large figure popped out from the bushes and jumped right for me.

Everything went black. 

When I first opened my eyes, I found that my vision was fuzzy. Although, I could tell right away where I was, and that would be my bedroom. I was in bed now staring straight at the closet like I normally would every morning. "Was that all just a dream?" I thought. One look in the mirror and I was proven to be wrong. My hair completely rustled unlike the usual morning wake-up do, little pieces of leaves, twigs, and dirt speckled on my shirt and pants, and especially the fact I was wearing a hoodie and jeans of which I wore that night.

This was a very creepy thing to happen to anyone, so that is why I'm here right now telling you this. I thought you might get a kick out of it, hell, maybe even a laugh. I don't know how I got home though, and why I can't remember getting back... Oh well, I'm not dead or anything so I guess I should count myself lucky.

But, there's just this thing getting at me... I've been getting this pretty wicked headache all morning. That's not all, I've had this itch ever since I woke up on the back of my neck. I haven't looked at it yet but I will soon. Everything worked out for the better I suppose. 

Lord, as I'm typing this out I can feel that awful taste in my mouth. Jesus, it really does taste awful now that I think about it, ugh. It's just about the worst thing I think I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. 

This taste in my mouth, It's not completely unfamiliar though... It's not like anything I've ever tasted before but... How can I describe it?

It tastes kind of...

Meaty.    




 It's nice to meet you sir! 




 I'm honestly confused as to why your comment is downvoted. The picture is indeed hilarious.  




 Thank you very much. It was a long read so thank you for taking the time to read through it all! 




 Holy... Shit... 




 Intense. 




 wow... Thank you! 




 I had the worst nightmare. It started out simple, and from there, it took a strange turn. From the get go anyone could tell something was wrong. Hell, I didn't even think nor knew that this was a dream, I just opened my eyes wondering what in gods name I was doing there naked and cuddled up to a tree. Funny enough, it was like I had woken up, as if someone snapped there fingers and there I was, naked and alone. But this was a dream, nothing more. 

The first thing that came to my attention was an old building that seemed to resemble a school or a college of some sort. It stood there being the only thing in the endless field of grass that I truly believed to stretch on forever, the only two things accompanying it being me and the tree I snuggled up against. I had this feeling that whatever I had to do, whatever happened, I should not take one step into the building. Though, then came the rain. My naked body started to freeze and shake uncontrollably as each drop felt like being pelted by a rock. It was painful, cold, and the first sign that this was no ordinary circumstance. It became so unbearable that I forced myself over to the building. The dew on the grass in between my toes and on the bottoms of my feet sent a spike of frost bite each step I took. It was so painful. I had no choice, I had to enter the building my consciousness warned me of. The pain was just too much. 

I had finally made it to this building and entered through the wooden doors. My body returned to its slightly chilled temperature as I gazed upon the giant entrance way. 

The entrance... how does it seem so hard to describe when it's so easy too? 

You see, The entrance was huge, but not in the way one would think it to be. It was empty, bare, completely stripped of life. It was big in length and width, though it was enormous in height. All the walls were completely concrete and the only things that stood out were a huge stair case leading up to a door that was the exact same size as the entrance I had just made my way through. Two tiny windows to the left and right of the door, not to far apart from the door itself, looked to touch to the ground on the floor that the door was on. Now, with this environment I stood in painted out for you, Something seemed completely off about this entrance way. It was familiar, but looked different from the image I was trying to picture in my head. To no avail could I remember where this familiarity came from. The entrance way looked as if something was meant for it, but that something never came to fruition, just like the picture in my head. I felt that, as much as this place started to tug at my mind, I shouldn't wait around for nothing.  

When my eyes met the ground, I saw clothing. Being naked at the time, it was only natural for me to put on whatever clothing I could find. A perfect fit. What I now had on seemed to be a hospital gown, but I knew for certain I wasn't in a hospital. I didn't let this bother me for long though as I wanted to move on. I felt that I needed to keep moving, and when this feeling came, so did the feeling of someone lingering behind. I turned around and looked all over, yet I could see no one, and there is no way anyone could have hid from me in this bare, completely stripped place. I decided it would be best to head for the door at the top of the stair case. 

When making my way up the stairs I heard something humming quietly. As I made my way further up the steps, It got a little louder. It kept building up in volume each step I made, so I ventured a little faster. Though, the more quickly I went, the more quickly the sound dominated the room. At one point it became clear as to what the sound was, and that sound was breathing. It was raspy and forced. This breathing got louder as I made my way up the stairs further and further. I looked behind me and all around but no one was there that I could see. I started to run up the stairs and the breathing got louder at a faster pace, as expected. But when I got closer to the door, the breathing became ear splitting. I nearly fell over when I rushed through the doors. But when I did get through to the other side, the breathing had stopped.

When I took a good look around where I was, I found myself in the hallway of a school. It was dark, and something told me to not go into any of the classrooms. Opposite of the door stood an elevator and two stair cases to the left and right of this elevator. It struck me as odd that there were two staircases, but I didn't question it much. The air was intense and struck this unbelievable feeling of dread coming my way. The silence was, for a lack of a better word, wrong. It was too silent, and that made me think that it was in preparation of something, something bad that is. 

*DING*

I jumped. It was the elevator. I looked over and found that the elevator was coming down to the floor I was on. The only thing that really tugged at my curiosity though was that there were no numbers for the floors. I know this sounds strange, but I didn't feel that the dread was coming from the elevator, but that it would come from somewhere else. Then I heard it, a door opening. It came from the entrance hall, if that's what you could call it. I didn't want to go back inside to check who it was, but right then I remembered the two windows that laid low to the floor. I went to look through the one that was onto my left since it was closer to me. I had to lay on my belly in order to look through to the other side, and when I did, I saw the silhouette of a man who looked no older than I did from what I could tell. He walked into the big empty entrance way and stood in the middle of it, something large in his right hand, and something quite small in the other. He just stood there and looked to the floor. Despite the entrance way being quite dark, this mans silhouette was unable to hide itself in that same darkness. He was, in the only way I could explain it to you, blacker than the whole room. I couldn't keep my eyes off of him. I just sat on my belly, wondering and contemplating as to what he was doing there. Then, catching me off guard, was a -   

*DING*

I turned around to see if the elevator had made it's way down to my floor. It hadn't. From what I could tell, it was just indicating that it had made its way a floor down. Though, even as a small detail, it struck me as odd how it took longer to make its way down a floor than the usual elevator would. I got up on my feet to investigate the elevator. As I did so, the moment I was about to gain full composure standing up, I instantly felt something very wrong. This itching feeling of being watched by a thousand eyes caught me from right under my feet. I looked to my right down the hall, and in each of the door ways, all the way to the end, was one silhouette peaking out from a classroom. I looked to my left to see the exact same thing. Although, it was only when they opened their eyes that the true terror had struck me. The eyes of each silhouette had been wide, and the whites of the eyes glorified by the small black pupil stained over. They made their way out of the class rooms and walked towards me, never blinking once and keeping their eyes wide with the look of pure and absolute terror. I stumbled back and landed on my ass, screaming. I couldn't think straight, so I ended up slowly trying to escape on my hands and knees. Each slap from my palms and the thuds from my knees on the hard, slippery floor hurt. Tears quietly seeping through the cracks of my eyelids while I tried my best to avoid the looks of the silhouettes was emotionally traumatizing. Go, go, go, was all that played throughout my mind. 

And then, the elevator made a ding. It was one floor closer now. Everything, the elevator, the silhouettes, the crawling, had made this the longest minute of my life. The pain I felt now could not even be compared to the pelting rain from before. That rain, as much as it hurt, would have been my haven from this. 

*DING* 

*DING*

Another ding, and another, each time coming sooner than the last. Something is coming, something is coming, something is coming, over and over in my head. Faster and faster the sound of my palms and the echoing thuds from my knees quickened pace as I tried so hard and desperately to get away. The feeling of hands reaching out towards me pumped me with more fear than I thought possible for anyone to go through. This forced my thirst for survival. I needed to get up, and I needed to do it now. I held my breath in and gained the strength to shoot upwards on my feet. I ran to the door as fast as I could, legs seemingly moving on a will of their own, and opened it. As scared as I was, something stopped me dead in my tracks. 

The whole entrance way was on fire. 

I couldn't believe it. When my head locked on to some small portion of sanity, I saw him there. The person who had walked into the entrance way, on fire. Now on the floor to his left and right was a gas can and a lighter. I didn't see the lighter since it was so small and hard to make out from where I was, but it was obvious given the circumstances. 

Then he did the funniest thing. He looked up at me and spoke in fuzzy distorted voice like a broken TV and said, "I did this all for you." 

He then backed away from the middle of the entrance way, and as he did so, a path among the flames emerged. The small separation between the flames was wide enough for me to run through to the entrance, so I ran. I ran fast, furiously with purpose, and made it to the doors that lead beyond the hell I was in.

But before I opened it, I looked back. I saw through the windows that lay low to the left and right of the door up the stairs. behind the glass of each window were the eyes of the silhouettes staring dead straight at me as if they wanted me to come back. That's when I noticed something about them I didn't when I first saw them, it was their skin. It looked as if  each silhouette had cracked skin since you could see tiny slits of pink show through. I was so confused as to what this was. It didn't hit me until I noticed the pain all throughout my body come instantly. I looked at my hands, and they were charcoal and cracked. I felt as if I had been burnt alive. As that thought came, I realized. 

They weren't silhouettes, they were burnt people. 

Then, complete defining screams wailed throughout the hall. Words were in the midst of the screams too, but they were so incoherent that I couldn't make out anything that was said. Now was the time I needed to leave. It took everything to open the doors, but when I finally did, I was greeted with the most calming sensation. The air was light and easy to breath, the rain that came was misty and refreshing. I looked up into the sky in relief and embraced the peace that was present. And as I stared into the ever calming sky, everything slowly faded to white. Then, from white, slowly, the blackness faded in.

I woke up. Once I landed back into reality from the nightmare, I looked around my dorm room, everything seemed normal. It was quiet, not a sound to be heard. I needed to get out for some fresh air after something as traumatizing as what I just went through, so I looked over at my room mate, Samantha, and forced her to wake up.

"Mmmm... What?" she said in a groggy voice.

"I had THE worst nightmare, EVER."

"Oh, really. That's swell." She whispered as she was about to fall back asleep. I didn't want to go alone, so I forced her with some good old fashioned Angelina bribery techniques.

"I swear to god, anything you want right now can be yours. Think of the cheetooooos."

"Cheetos... I would like some cheetos..."

"Then lets get going!"

"Okay. I'll, uh, get something street worthy on and then we'll rock'n'roll in a sec here." She replied, getting up to put some clothes on in place of PJ's.

We walked to the gas station that was open 24/7 and got some snacks and slurpees. I told Sam all about my dream and, with a sleepy smile on her face, comforted me the best she could in her tired state. After talking about some other things, I heard something that took my breath right out from me. 

I heard a fire truck go by. A second later it became apparent that there wasn't just the one,  because after that fire truck sped by, I heard a bunch drive right down the road full speed...

Full speed towards MY college.

I ran back in a full-on sprint, my friend behind me trying to catch up wondering what the hell was going on. When we finally arrived, I just became dead inside, dropping all the groceries to the floor. I stared, completely floored by what had just happened and to what I was looking at.

the college was in complete flames.

My friend and I didn't know what to say, but I don't think we would have said anything anyway even if we did know the words that should be spoken. Not after having me talk about my dream and then seeing this could we even comprehend to what was going on. 

After the fire, they told the community what had happened. No one in the college survived. After many weeks of not even knowing where to start in order to understand what happened, we went through the mourning of our friends. Me and Samantha have become closer friends after that. Each day she says its because of me that she's alive today. I am her guardian angel, as she always tells me. And so on, after all the chaos, I started to wonder about the dream. I'm I a psychic, a fortune teller, why the fuck did I have that dream?

Even after all the questions have been made, I found it unnecessary to answer them. I'm alive today, and hopefully for a long time. In the end, Isn't that all that matters? Even so, That dream... No, that nightmare, has haunted me since. I have never had a dream like that since, and I hope I never do, or, to better put it, never have to. 

I can't just leave it here as I have something I need to tell you, but this is all I will tell. 

If you ever have a nightmare that scars you in a way you'll never forget, it may not just be a nightmare. It may be a warning. Heed that warning, or you may never see tomorrow ever again.
   




 Oh, he knows whats going on. Smart little bad ass is looking out the window straight at a tiger. This I assure you. 




 Smelling salts, huh... smooth, guys. Smooth... 




 Will do, Thanks! 




 I have never thought of this before! I always wanted to try and do some research on what really happened to my friend, but I never knew where to start. Thank you for giving me another theory to work on. This incident is something I'll never be able to forget, and something that I hope to solve, thank you.  




 Look, I still don't know what happened, but for years it's haunted me. Keeping something inside your head as scaring as this is like having a lion in a rusted, old, creaky cage. At one point, you have to tell someone or that cage will break and let something dangerous come out. So here's what happened, or at least to an extant.

When I was twelve, me and my friend, Pat, wanted to try "The jump." "The jump" was this infamous legend passed around the school that captivated every kid who heard of it. The legend was that if you and  anyone else with you at the time jumped off a certain cliff and called out "catch me!" someone would catch you right before you fall. The thing about the legend was no one knew which cliff along the river was the right one to use. Almost every kid in my school had tried and failed. The assumption was that they had all picked the wrong spots, but this only motivated kids further to find the right cliff. I, at the time, thought it was something made up by a student at my school to scare others. But that didn't mean I wasn't a little captivated myself.

One day, my friend Patrick came running to me with this excited look on his face and told me, "Matt, I swear to god, I found it!" Patrick was always a little infatuated with this tale, and as a result of this, he had wanted to find the real cliff ever since he heard about it. He continued on by explaining how he over heard his parents talking about a cliff where someone had died.

"It's got to be the real thing! Someone died there! They have to be the ghost that catches you before you fall!" Pat exclaimed. I was curios, so I decided to tag along and see the cliff that Pat was so sure about.

Now, before I go any further, I need to explain that this is where things got strange. This is the point where I cannot for the life of me explain as to why these things happened. I wish I could, maybe then I could get closure.

When we got there, I could feel a chill down my spine, the uneasiness in the air, and felt as if I had stepped directly into another dimension. But all that was topped off with the drop from the cliff. Even as a twelve year old, I knew that the fall would most likely kill someone. With all of that into consideration, it was Pats enthusiasm that really got to me. I knew that this whole time he had doing the jump in mind, and after seeing the hell-bound fall, he looked all to ready to just fall a good few miles down to his death.

"Pat, are you crazy!? That fall will kill us!" Pat gave me this confused look and said, "What in the world are you talking about? Sure, it's a good few feet, but kill us?" He then continued with a hint of laughter and legitimate confusion, "I think you're the crazy one here."

I was shocked. Pat was always a down-to-earth, smart, and sensible kind of guy. His answer was a slap in the face to me. A few feet? No way in hell that this drop was a few feet. I didn't know what to say, and before I could get any words out to Pat, he turned to face the cliff. 

"Come on!" he said, "We gotta do it together!"

I couldn't. I was scared and could feel my mortality tugging at me. I shook my head and quietly said no. Pat still looked confused and started to even look a little worried for me.

"I'll tell you what, I'll go first and then you can see for yourself if it's okay or too much for you." He then took a good run and jumped.

I ran as fast I could to catch him, but I was just to far away to get to him in time. He yelled "WOOHOO!!!" as he took the leap. It only took three seconds of him falling until he broke out into a horrid scream. I saw him flailing his arms and legs all over in protest until he reached the water. A defining splash sounded out silently as if two hard rocks collided with each other. I knew for sure that the fall had killed him. There is no way he survived from a drop that far down. I didn't cry, I didn't fall on my knees either, I just ran as fast as I could.

I kept running in a full on sprint through the woods. I didn't care about the bushes that scratched at my legs, or the low down branches that whipped my face, I just wanted to run away from there. But out of no where, catching me completely off guard, was the most terrifying thing I have ever heard. It was screaming. It was the loudest, most helpless scream I have ever been able to experience in my life. This literally sounded like the act of murder being committed right in front of me. I kept running and running until I made it out of the woods. When I finally did make it out of the brush, the screaming slowly faded away.

I have never told anyone, not even the police about what happened. Patrick was declared missing, and I somehow grasped tight onto my secrecy of what really happened to him. You have to understand, I was so scared, and I still am today. 

Years later, here I am writing this out in hopes I can find at least some closure as to what really happened that day. It's just that... Out of everything that happened to me that day, It was the look on Patrick's face that has haunted me the most to this day. He looked So... Excited.  




 The Haunting - Absolutely awesome.
