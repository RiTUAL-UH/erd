 Thanks, I think that was it. 




 I just started playing destiny so I'm only level 5, but I've found a few times that I'll start a mission and some of the enemies are way to high of a level for me to beat, and they're immune at all my attacks. How do I avoid this?
Thanks and sorry if this is a stupid question 




 Those words have never stopped me before 




 I love you. 




 I hate when people complain about a shit post then still proceed to comment a huge reply.  




 That there is a person with the username LennyRabbitz on reddit 




 I also came for gears of war 2, but for Dom's wife. Tai was also very disturbing.
