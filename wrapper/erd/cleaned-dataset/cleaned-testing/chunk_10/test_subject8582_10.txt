 Steven+Sugilite? 




 Where were u when society was fuck 




 My book backlog is beyond ridiculous. I find that my main problem is that while I'm reading, sitting in silence actually hurts my concentration. Of course, a lot of the music I've tried tends to be rather distracting (or at the very least, doesn't fit the mood). What are your thoughts? Any recommendations? 




 Sci Fi- the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's easily my favorite book of all time (the first sequel as well, the rest kinda got away from me) and outside of Foundation, a good candidate for greatest Science Fiction novel. 

That being said, the Foundation books are probably also on there. I can't say for certain, I've never actually finished them (sorry)

Superhero/Graphic Novel- Watchmen. Fuckin'... duh. 

Though as for graphic novels, I would also like to give a shoutout to the Neon Genesis Evangelion manga, if only because I love NGE, and the graphic novel is pretty spectacular.  




 Sugilite should be sponsored by Monster. Considering, [you know...](http://youtu.be/3fD_KYpWSJE) 




 This is Wall Street

Back together

And I'll never have a recession at the hands of the stock market because we're doing much better

And the economy is saying "go get her"

The Upper Class ain't gonna follow your rules

Come at me without any of your commie fools

Let's go, just me and you

Let's go, my profits grew

Go ahead and overthrow me if you're able

Can't you see that the economy is stable

I can see you hate the way we trade under the table

But you're just mad your revolution's been disabled 




 Whatever happened to Ocean Town is apparently still "too soon" in SU 




 So that's... 7000000000!, I think.  




 What the hell is wrong with your backwards-ass continent? 




 Zoom, Samuel, Zoom! 




 Where did Steven come from? 




 Lucina

Flatter than Mr Game and Watch. 0/10 waifu 




 Hey yo my name is Drake, do you know my buddy Samuel? 




 Totally satire. Though it's getting harder and harder to tell.  




 Def satire.  









 This coy little Jew.  




 Cop out bastards... 




 Two words: Papyrus Sans.  




 Looks like the Antispiral is doing its job.  




 As if this show weren't disappointing enough.... 




 Maybe it's because Look Who's Talking isn't good.  




 Mr Game and Watch? 




 Sad teenagers and giant robots 




 Fortunately for her she's not a singer, she's a rapper.  




 Don't get me wrong, Strong in the Real Way is probably the second or third best song in the show, but Sugilite totally should have gotten a verse. You don't get Nicki Minaj and *not* have her rap, Rebecca. Come on.  




 That makes the last panel even better. "Ah, cockblock!" 




 Terminator 2? 




 ...most of the Godzilla franchise

[anyway, here's an article that can probably explain it better than my sleep-deprived brain](http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/evil-dead/220045/bruce-campbell-explains-the-evil-dead-timeline) 




 End of Evangelion? 




 A man cuts off his hand and almost destroys the world by reading a book.  




 Unless you mean something other than a continuation of the same story, then in pretty sure you agree.  




 According to Bruce Campbell, Evil Dead 2 actually is a sequel in the traditional sense. They couldn't get the rights to their own movie, so instead they made the first part of the movie a sort of modified recap of the first movie. If you took the end of ED1 (when Ash gets hit in the face with the first-person thing) and put it in ED2 when he gets hit again, you'd have the proper continuity.  




 "Do your parents know you're straight?" 




 **MAYOR SUEY**

**MAYOR SUEY** 




 Amopthyst confirmed hottest nude scene in GoT. 




 I love the amount of overlap between TTGL and Steven Universe.  




 I'd actually get a Peach is Pink Gold Peach was an option.  




 Dank ass memes.  




 "I'm always a slut for Doritos!"

"You're cheating on me with Peridot?!" 




 I'm pretty sure he is in he show too. Isn't it like that in Rebuild because of Tunniel? 




 It starts out with bands like One Direction to catch the defener crowd, but by the end of the show they're delving into more loved classic bands like the Beatles. "But /u/test_subject8582," I hear you asking "Surely there are people who would be perfectly accepting of the Beatles' songs 24/7. Many people probably already do that." So my solution: start off with their good stuff (first couple days alternate between Lucy in the Sky, Sgt Pepper, etc.) but as people refuse to leave, slowly start replacing songs with their worse songs (Swap out Yellow Submarine in the rotation for Octopus' Garden for example). By the season finale, we have people listening exclusively to Yoko Ono's contributions.  




 "I'm not my mom! I'm me! Steven the digger! Just who the heck do you think I am?!" 




 Fun momp  




 This one is pretty heavy on the themes, so it's definitely not irrelevant.  




 It ain't easy being white... 




 Henry Winkler should be Harvey Dent, then when he becomes Two Face Bob Loblaw could replace him.  




 *Mr. F* 




 Sachiel is the third angel, isn't he?  




 I have the Inkling girl since I plan on getting Splatoon later. But aside from that the figure is just great.  




 Where my other 46 patriots at? 




 I made sure my brother got really invested in Kamina when he watched Gurren Lagann. 

I did the same thing with Mami when he started Madoka Magica.  




 Nintendo needs to distribute All-Terrain Venonat 




 Student government is basically our new religion 




 But a true man doesn't die, even when he's killed! 




 Kaworu Nagisa from Evangelion (especially the manga)

[Gay Alien Jesus died for your sins remember](http://img07.deviantart.net/a89a/i/2011/212/f/3/kaworu_nagisa_by_morrow_x-d4299z9.png) 




 Now we need Slothzilla vs Slothra.  




 Well done steaks come from a history of people with shitty taste.  




 I need to understand something: is Umaru actually a shapeshifting demon creature? Or is it just stylistic? Because teenage girl T-1000 is fine by me.  




 [Noriko Takaya](http://imgur.com/ONQq4fc) from Gunbuster. Not only is she pretty, but she digs giant robots (and hers is fucking huge, even by giant robot standards). Top it all off with being written as a human, not just a heroine for a cheesy mech show, and you've got the absolute best girl in all of anime.  




 Which means all of them could run for President. 

Would Garnet have to be her own running mate? Could Alexandrite run *and* have a VP?  




 Jasper does nothing but John all day every day.  




 Calling it now Yellowtail is a front for Yellow Diamond.  




 Even better, the Constitution still says she's eligible. 

No person except a natural born Citizen, **or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution**, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States

Amethyst for first female rock president 




 Maybe stating his true feeling on squares is what broke up Square Mom? IT WAS SOMETHING YOU DID! 




 Gem Drill

Gurren Lagann crossover confirmed? Though I would have gone with *Say "Who the Hell do you think I am?!"* 




 what the hell why haven't i heard about this 




 ...and also a demigod who laughs in the face of all known laws of physics. And Mexican. 




 I feel like Jasper would play Ganondorf or Ike, two heavy hitters with little strategy involved. 

Peridot mains Shulk, like the most technical character in the game. 

Amethyst plays Mewtwo, because he's purple and cool.  




 Are you referring to End of Evangelion? The 1997 movie? Because we can't link to pirated content.  




 [Amir Mii](http://imgur.com/TiQPzcW) vs [Real Amir](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Amir_Blumenfeld_2010.jpg)

I'm not good at this, but I need these golden gods in my Tomodachi Life and I figured I'd give it a go.  




 PSA: The only acceptable name for Silver Mario is T-1000.  




 So like the Gurren Lagann movies? 




 I checked but it's not on there, only SAC 2nd GIG.  




 The DVD I got is called Individual Eleven and seems to be an OVA/Movie. I can't seem to find any timeline information for it. 




 I just recently finished the first season, so should I watch this after the second? After Solid State Society? Never? 




 Sneople control the government at the highest levels.  




 How the hell does Greg have such an awful sunburn if he wears the wifebeater all the time? Surely his tan lines would be very different considering that's just about all he wears.  




 It's not as cerebral as some of the stuff you have listed, but Hideaki Anno's directorial debut, Gunbuster, has some existential themes. It's also badass as fuck and i reccomend it as a knee jerk reaction to just about anything. 

Ghost In the Shell (the original movie, and to a lesser extent the show) fits what you're looking for pretty nicely.  




 "A PICTURE WORT A THOUSAND WORDS! WHICH IS WHY I AM NOW EXPLAINING ITS SIGNIFICANCE TO YOU IN AS MUCH DEPTH AS I CAN MANAGE!!!!!!" 




 There's a good chance we'll be getting 3.0+1.0 before the 3.33 English BluRay. 

Gay Alien Jesus didn't die for this.  




 Can I get this as a poster? 




 "looks like you're hiding from a serial killer! Would you like some advice on being stealthy?"  




 Well according to the retcon, they did work for Stalin... 




 I think the artist forgot they were drawing Asuka and not Mari right around the center,  




 Filthy Frank 




 They were also working with Stalin, Genghis Khan, and Mao. They also probably inspired Judas.  




 rot in peace 




 Probably a Tumblr reaction to jokes.  




 I like that they did that, since it helps all the characters from different universes (and more importantly, art styles) to be in one game at the same time. It's not quite as good as Smash, but it works.  




 Madoka Magica (especially the film, Rebellion) is pretty mindfucky.  




 How the hell would I read the message to run if you don't have it.  




 Sex sells.  




 Fun fact: discrimination in places of public accommodation is against the law. Lose your job, asshole! 




 "You're a kid now..." 




 [I think they all believed him in the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW35t1H4yfk) 









 I legitimately thought this was Deep Dream.  




 hey its me ur brother 




 ~~FUCK. HOW DO THESE THINGS ALWAYS SELL OUT BEFORE I HEAR ABOUT THEM. GOD FUCKING DAMNIT.~~

Edit: nvm I got one. We still good.  




 The anime's getting pretty lewd.  




 -Gurren Lagann

-Gunbuster (and to a lesser extent, its sequel Diebuster) 




 "Burden of evidence? What's that?" 




 "I think you copied"

"I didn't. Where do you think I copied from?"

"Fuck off asshole you copied I ain't gotta prove shit" 




 "Men are taught from birth to believe they're always right! As a woman, I know this to be objective fact, because I'm always right!" 




 How do you feel about dinosaur laser fights?

In space?

With sharks? 




 It's okay you can swear on the Internet.  




 I just can't figure out Seel.  




 Not limited by the balances of Smash Bros, these two duke it out to see who's really our boy.  




 [FORFEIT MY NIGGA](https://youtu.be/wubpjxB4O7M) 




 This is the worst thing to happen to Terminator since Terminator 3.  




 Happened to me while I was playing Roy earlier.  




 I wouldn't go so far as to call them *filthy*, but they're definitely dirty.  




 No 




 Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fthagn! 




 [thats not all](http://imgur.com/dvUd5Ig) 




 The Z-Fighters were too powerful by the Saiyan Saga. Picollo could blow up the Moon, Nappa levelled an entire city (which might put him on Godzilla's level, considering he took a city busting meteor without so much as a scratch), Vegeta was apparently a *planet buster* (though that's apparently non-canon). And we can't forget how powerful the Destructo-Disc is. Godzilla doesn't stand a chance, much as I would like him to.  




 Fast

The Flash, hands down.  




 I've been playing as Rosalina whenever she was an option since Mario Kart Wii.  




 Is there some unspoken rule that all screenshots have to be on a near-death battery percentage? 




 I hope it doesn't look like Advent Children. The characters just don't look good when you make them that realistic. It looks like cosplay, in a bad way. Especially since they choose to play up Cloud's Elmo factor.  




 Rekt is non negotiable.  




 Is Andy Samberg hitting on Cera's cousin? 




 JFK was a proud POC!! 




 [Smiley](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2025667/) 




 How so?  




 Not quite the song you're looking for (That's either Good or Don't Be, or The Heady Feeling of Freedom) but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW_Ez3nV0ic) is a slower a Capella version of the song.  




 This is absolutely satire. It's even making fun of one of the worse (non-satire) minion memes, in which "a big black man raping you in the ass" is replaced by "if people are talking behind your back" 




 It was the voice actress for Rei/Yui screaming, but pitched down. That's what they did for both the dub and sub, iirc.  




 From the Inception episode.  




 While it's certainly not for everyone, its influence alone is a reason to watch it. Seeing where the mech genre, and really most modern anime, get some of their inspiration from is worth 26 episodes and a movie. In addition, End of Evangelion is the 2001: A Space Odyssey of anime in many ways.   




 Still has better animation than the actual show.  




 Because as she's proven since, she totally deserved to be given power.  




 Been doing that for the past couple decades.  




 I'd also like to point out that this minion is putting on blackface.  









 That's the joke I was going for.  




 I always just slide the stick up and down the bottom-right quarter. Like doing a Hadouken backwards then a regular Hadouken. I find it works rather well.  




 It's easy to tell the difference because one has no boobs and the other is a guy.  




 The problem with putting STTGL against enemies like SP1M is that Spiral Power is the negation to any rational argument against itself. It exists to do nothing but not make sense. It would be like having SP1M fight Bugs Bunny, since Toonforce is the same as Spiral Power. The only difference is that instead of being able to do anything as long as it would be funny, Spiral Power can do anything as long as it would be badass.  




 It's silly, but it's how it works.

literally Gurren Lagann in one sentence.  









 Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann wins, thanks to its near infinite Spiral Power. Simon can literally do the impossible, as he's won battles he had a 0% chance of winning. Spiral Power is the most powerful form of reality warping and STTGL has it in spades.  




 It'd be effective at getting me to turn off my Adblock if it weren't for the fact that now I have it on out of spite.  




 Palutena's God-tier and you know it.  




 Disco MILF is the best anime adult. 




 Judgement.  




 Every time I mention Squid Girl people just assume it's tentacle porn.  




 By Evangelion standards, they totally are.  




 Evangelion and Gunbuster. If only because Noriko and Shinji would be the best couple.  




 Also when Touji punches Shinji, and Shinji doesn't want to fight back. That's foreshadowing the events surrounding Bardiel.  




 One of us is a whiny German bitch, one of us is a badass space robot pilot, one of us is a badass space robot pilot *and hot*, one of us Is an 80-meter self-regenerating giant monster full of questionably edible meat who also happens to be immortal and a mother, and one of us is an invisible robotic cop. 

Pretty sure Yui Ikari can spare some legs thanks to the S2 engine.  




 Asshole Goku would have killed Earth within a few years, meaning he never would have learned anything about the Dragon Balls, the Kamehameha, or anything else that gives Goku his immense power. He never would have been able to learn from any other Saiyans, considering they were all dead. 

Real Goku stomps 10/10 




 Sparkle sparkle sparkle! 




 Jon is always relevant, isn't he? He's like a human Guile's Theme.  




 Noriko takes Simon's core drill, and they trade robots and duke it out. Simon is post-timeskip. 

Round 1: Noriko in regular Gurren Lagann vs Simon in Noriko's machine weapon from the first epsiode. 

Round 2: Noriko in space-Gurren Lagann (the one with wings) vs Simon in Noriko's space Machine Weapon. 

Bonus round: They replace each other in their respective shows. Can Noriko defeat Lordgenome and the Antispiral? Can Simon, stripped of Spiral Power, defeat the space monsters and still have an entirely unrelated sequel? 




 Falcomaster 3000 has been unmasked! 




 Shiek and Zelda. Keep it between a man and a woman.  




 [Because it rhymes](https://youtu.be/9_ISZJVXxoU) 




 I welcome the sweet embrace of Instrumentality.  









 Fuck does Nono have to do with this? Leave Diebuster alone! 




 The only thing I could think of would be to find your own 1-2 inch Squid Girl figure and just replace the Inkling girl. If you did this, you'd probably also have to paint the ink on the base Ika's shade of blue.  




 they banned the Evil Dead? Clearly they haven't let go of their fascist censorship.  




 There's no real *counter*evidence to the order being Rebuild then NGE, but there's almost no evidence in favor of that theory. NGE then Rebuild, on the other hand, has loads of evidence to suggest that it directly follows NGE in the grand timeline. Kaworu's dialogue in both his cameos in 1.11 and 2.22 as well as a couple lines in 3.33 imply that he's been through this before, while episode 24 has no such implications. Even a bunch of the Angels (notably Ramiel) are more powerful than they had been before. Combined with the red sea and potential Mass-Production Evangelion (from End of Evangelion) outline on the hill in the opening of 1.11, there's really not a lot to say that Rebuild isn't a sequel to something, assuming you buy into Time Loop theory at all, that is. 

Really, we'll probably end up getting confirmation one way or the other when 3.0+1.0 comes out.  




 In the dub I watched he was Mr Satan.
