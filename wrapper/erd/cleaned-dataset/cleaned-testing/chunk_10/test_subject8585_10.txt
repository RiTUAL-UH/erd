 The dessert was using the Fritos to scoop up the leftover chili and cheese! 




 Fritos corn chips.  Where you from? 




 These were some high-end pork   venison sausage dogs that had jalapenos already in the dog.  Maybe some battered fried jalapeno slices for garnish? 




 That steak looks great but those potatoes and broccoli are something that definitely won't be ignored! 









 I've never used one so I can't comment.  I am thinking about getting a Big Green Egg!  Grill, smoker and "oven" up to 750F!  Expensive but worth it. 




 Here's the pics you asked for.  Couldn't get the specialty tortilla section.  Tell your friend that this doesn't included the regular commercial bread, rolls, bun selection.

 You have to introduce some kind of moisture somewhere in the cooking process.  Straight grilling or baking in the oven won't achieve what you're trying for.  You can use water, juice, beer etc.  You really don't want to cook them until they fall off the bone.  Points are taken away in competition for that.  Try to find that sweet spot where they adhere to the bone but easily come off when eaten.  Most people use the 3-2-1 but it's not an exact science.  Happy Ribbin'    




 I find it interesting that people equate race with nationality.  Here in Texas a lot of our best Japanese chefs are from Mexico which is not surprising if you know the political mandates and laws that were passed in the US and Mexico.  Food/Cuisine seems to be a wonderful connection that crosses racial and political boundaries!  Yea! 




 Are you to tell me that there are white people with a Swedish, German and Russian background that were born and raised in Mexico or other South American countries that are considered true Mexicans ect.?  




 WTF is transraciality,  (excluding that woman from the NAACP)? 




 I'm sure your fatty friends, if you have any, appreciate such a thoughtful gesture KimcheeBreath which no doubt describes you to a tee! 




 Actually she thought it was pretty funny and we're family.  BTW, I'm the one on the right so...... 









 I've made literally thousands of meatloafs of all kinds, standard with ketchup glaze, Cajun, stuffed, rolled, you name it but IMO this is the best recipe I've found.  The key is to use fresh herbs. DO NOT substitute for dry.

 Before you eat something like this just imagine your heart looking just like the fat studded and nitrate infused yummyness that it is! 









 I'd pay for it only if they sprinkled fleur de sel on it along with some sort of amazing dipping sauce.  




 I'll take some pics and post soon.  In the meantime, tell your German friend that Texas has a long and close history with the German and Czech people.  Our beloved Chicken Fried Steak is based on Schnitzel.  Our best Brewery's were originally owned by Germans immigrants.  There was a time when some small towns in Texas printed their newspapers in German and after a century had passed,  European German speakers couldn't make hide nor hair what the locals Germans were saying!   Here's a link to one of the original German restaurants.  http://kubys.com/about-us/ 




 Ah onions!  I was thinking it looked somewhat lumpy. 




 You got it! 




 You missed a chip with the sour cream. 




 I like the diamonds better than the squares.  For some reason it looks more appetizing. 









 What if the painter was also a crazy a$$h013?

 8 layer mexican dip cake.  I need a better name for this lol!  




 I was tempted to make a respectable version of the Bologna Cake but my hubby talked me out of it.  I still think I could make one that Lola wants! 




 Sour cream and cream cheese.   




 I do to and I feel for anyone that doesn't have one close. 




 Si 














 I may just do that if you make me a sandwich lol! 




 Fancy mayo, Tillamook cheese and Jim Beam and you can cook.  Are you married?  If not, do you want to be? 




 You could use anything your heart desires.   




 Couldn't decide between making cinnamon rolls or cherry Kolaches so I did both. 




 The original ratatouille recipe had the vegetables fried before baking. Since at least 1976, top French chefs have prepared the ratatouille vegetables in thin slices instead of the traditional rough-cut.[citation needed] Michel Gurard, in his book founding cuisine minceur (1976),[3] recreated lighter versions of the traditional dishes of nouvelle cuisine.[4] His recipe Confit bayaldi, differed from ratatouille by not frying the vegetables, removing peppers and adding mushrooms.

American celebrity chef Thomas Keller first wrote about a dish he called "byaldi" in his 1999 cookbook, The French Laundry Cookbook.[5] Keller's variation of Gurard's added two sauces, a tomato and peppers sauce at the bottom (piprade), and a vinaigrette at the top.[6][7] He served as food consultant to the Pixar film Ratatouille, allowing its producer, Brad Lewis, to intern for two days in the kitchen of his restaurant, The French Laundry. Lewis asked Keller how he would cook ratatouille if the most famous food critic in the world were to visit his restaurant.[1] Keller decided he would make the ratatouille in confit byaldi form, and fan the vegetable rounds accordion-style with a palette knife.[8] - Wikipedia 




 Maybe r/shittyfoodporn would help LOL! 




 Thumbs up to anyone that makes their own fresh pasta.  Looks good! 









 Please stop trying to recreate the Ratatouille from the movie.  The original is so much better.  

  




 You should try it sometime.  This is my Thai dog with carrots, cucumbers, scallions, peanut sauce and sriracha.

 Kinda thought so. Thanks!
 




 Here's the ingredients for the chili.  Up to you to figure out how prepare.  Can't give away all my secrets!  Hint:  don't add all the spices at one time.

10 lb chuck roast, lg dice
Vegetable oil for browning the beef
3 lg sweet yellow onions, med dice
2 1/2 qt beef stock
2 cups stout beer
42 oz whole tomatoes, fresh or canned
2 cups picante sauce
3 fresh limes
12 roasted garlic cloves
5 Tbls roasted cumin seeds, crushed
10 Tbls chili powder
1 cn tomato paste
3 jalapenos, green, whole, pickled
2 jalapenos, red, fresh
2 habanera peppers, fresh
3 cups nopales (cactus)
1 cup corn masa
1 dark chocolate bar
3 cans black beans, optional!
3 cans chili beans, optional!
salt and pepper, to taste 




 No, it's "Angie's Bikkles" in Fort Worth.  I've heard of a place in Arlington, "Jamaican Gate" that they tell me is really good too. 




 When you eat a Chicago dog do you take the peppers off and then take bites as you go or do you leave them on and get one or two big bites of pepper? 




 It's my recipe for chili that I used for a Navy chili cook-off when I was stationed on the USS Halsey (Hit hard, Hit fast, Hit often!)  




 This look absolutely beautiful!  I didn't know day lilies were edible!  I was expecting watermelon pickles instead of pickled watermelon.  









 Nice photo but this is chips and dips, or the makings of a salad and not nachos!  









 In the 70's my mother was fired from her job because I fell and and broke my arm and the babysitter couldn't drive me to the hospital and my mom couldn't pay for an ambulance.  I'm sure Jeb and Cruz would approve!     




 RIP. 




 Only if you like surprises, thanks though! 




 To be honest it was okay.  The chorizo Spam was a bit overwhelming.  I'd use it again but diced up and used more as a seasoning.  I think the original, hickory or bacon Spam would work better waffled.   




 Same with garlic cloves VVV.  The green sprout should be removed as it has a bitter flavor. 




 Recipe:

4 oz bacon, diced and cooked
2 oz Swiss cheese, shredded
1 blind baked pie shell
4 eggs
1 pt milk
4 oz heavy cream
salt and pepper, to taste
pinch of nutmeg

Place the bacon and shredded cheese in the baked pie shell.

To make the custard, combine the eggs, milk and cream, and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.

Pour the custard over the bacon and cheese and bake at 350F until the custard is cooked, approximately 1 hour.

I used a large quiche/tart pan but a 9 in pie pan can also be used.

I reversed the layers for contrast plus the coconut layer is slightly thicker then the chocolate layer.  

Enjoy! 









 You have booths in your kitchen besides the kitchen table?  Nice try.
 




 Jeb, Barack and Will Wheaton on the same page?  Must be bad! 




 Rinsing browned hamburger in hot water instead of just letting it drain washes away a lot more of the fat/calories.  Not sure the exact amount but it helps.
 









 It's a truck but they have a permanent location next to a bar with whom they share picnic tables.  Are you in Texas? 




 Wanted to give a ^ but your tomato soup looks like puke.  Maybe add some tomato paste/sauce. 




 Some people that have actually died and said they went to heaven and saw loved ones there.  How is this possible when the bible says that no one shall enter heaven until after the Judgement Day?   




 Wish I could make that trip!   




 That's original.  Why?  Don't like Ranch? 









 What restaurant were you at? 




 Looks great but most Wellingtons have a layer of duxelle or herbs between the pastry and roast.  




 I used it for Stroganoff when I didn't have sour cream and I've made it a part of the recipe ever since.   




 Looks like a Mexican Thanksgiving!  OMG, plate one! 




 I recommend Ranch dressing for a substitute.  Any way you still win! 









 Add some smashed roasted garlic and I think I could live on this for the rest of my life! 




 Did ya'll know that giraffes snore? 









 Nope. 




 Wish I knew!  Maybe I'll ask next time I go.

 During and after the US Vietnam war many refugees were located in specific areas in the US.  Texas was one of them.  I lived in a three story bottom-floor apartment in the 70's and the two (three bedroom) apartments above housed a total of 17 Vietnamese.  Their rent was subsidized by churches and their church buses would pick them up every Sunday,  then drop them off.  Guess what?  Every religious holiday they celebrated that was not Christian, they celebrated above our apartment.  We even had a white guy that sold Vietnamese food out of the back of a U-haul in our apartment lot!  Still love the cuisine!!          




 Asian-Mex!  Look up the history of Chinese immigration into Mexico and you'll get it.  Mexicans have an appreciation and love of Chinese cooking that most of America doesn't get. 









 Pretzel roll. 









 Yes, specifically avocado puree with a touch of lemon juice.   




 At least you called it Country Fried steak instead of Chicken Fried Steak.  The two are not the same.  Yours looks yummy and reminds me more of a Swiss (tomato) or Smothered Steak a la Soul Food. 




 Maybe. 




 What's the scoop on restaurant tomatoes? 




 I made literally thousands of these in the Navy.  Confused the hell out of me when people referred to a sausage wrapped in a pastry dough as a kolache.  Found out the proper name for the later is  klobasnek.      




 You need to check out Pearl Snaps in Ft Worth.   




 I first thought you were giving us your recipe for a lobster filling lol. 









 http://food52.com/recipes/24302-fatted-calf-s-meatloaf

Notes:
1.  If you don't want to use a grinder just use 1 1/2 lbs ground beef, 1 lbs ground pork, add flavor packet and let sit overnight.
2.  Add the remaining fennel seeds and chili flakes to the glaze.
3.  The panade is the bread mixture.
4.  The leftover drippings make a wonderful tomato gravy.  









 Tossed the lettuce with a little Italian dressing.  Added some creole mustard to mayo for the spread.  We've got a JerseyMikes's here, will have to check it out!

 Good news!  Pork doesn't have to be cooked like your mom probably did,  grey on the inside with the consistency of leather.  Updated USDA rules:

 Flour fire.  Never smoke while baking! 




 Can't confirm above.  All I know is distilled white vinegar and baking soda is excellent when used to clean out drains or make table-top volcanoes for third-grade science projects.  lol!
 




 Try this "home" solution:

1/4 cup white vinegar,
1-2 Tsp Dawn detergent,
1/4 cup Arm   Hammer "washing soda"  found in the cleaning isle.  Don't substitute baking soda, not the same thing!,
2 gal hot water.

Mix until bubbly.  A little goes a long way.  Don't use on waxed floors, JS.  

Maybe invest in a good steam cleaner and use after mopping.  Steam works great to help to kill bacteria too!   




 Since I can I now dub the combination of "Hotter than Hell" pasta with coconut shrimp and a cooling banana dipping sauce I hereby declare thee, "Shrimp Loki"! 




 Here's most of the recipes:

Coconut Shrimp

1. Shell (leave the tail), devein and butterfly 1-lbs of 21/26 fresh shrimp.  Thoroughly dry with paper towels.
2.  Set up 3 bowls.  First bowl with 1/2 cup flour, 1 Tsp cayenne or ground red pepper, 1/2 Tsp of cracked black pepper.  Second bowl with 3/4 cup pancake batter or Bisquick and 3/4 cup flat beer.  Third bowl with 2 cups coconut flakes either sweetened or not.
3.  Take each shrimp and dip into 1st bowl, shake excess off.  Dip into 2nd bowl, let drip or shake off excess then place in 3rd bowl with the cut side spread open and down then cover with coconut and press lightly to gently stick.  Place each shrimp, tail side up, onto a pan lined with wax paper and lightly coated with coconut.  
4.  Refrigerate for 1/2 hour or freeze for future use. (If freezing, make sure shrimp aren't touching)
5.  Heat deep-fat fryer to 350F.  Holding the shrimp by the tail, lower until the shrimp is covered with oil and then carefully hold for 30 seconds then let drop into the fryer.  Fry for 3 +/- minutes if refrigerated until golden brown.  (If frozen,  fry until golden brown then place in an oven to finish cooking the shrimp.  Drain on paper towels and serve.  

Caribbean Hushpuppies

  At this point I had batter, flour and coconut leftover so I just mixed them until I had the proper consistency and using one spoon to gather about a Tbsp and another to drop it off into the hot oil,  I fried them until they floated.

I served this with a tropical "Pasta from Hell",  spicy dipping banana sauce and Key Lime Pie.  Recipe provided on request.


      




 Tried the Outback recipe and another that said to mix some of the coconut with the batter.  Refrigerated and froze both but the batter still fell off.  Finally found Bubba Gump's "Dumb Luck" recipe and with a few tweaks it came out perfect!
