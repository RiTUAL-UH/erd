 So here's some context. I am in highschool (I am 18) and i was staying a friends house, safe place to smoke, one of my buddies just got an RDA rebuildable ecig. I had some dabs and thought hell these would work on the ecig. I took one huge rip, then 2 decent ones. I pretty much collapsed on the bed and instantly at a [10]. After a short period of time everything started warping and I got dizzy. At this point it's about 8pm and like 30 minutes after the dab, I started tripping, straight up tripping. I saw dinosaurs that were like holograms and rainbow static there was also a screen of sorts that had some alien looking language on it that was controlling with my hands. That happened for about 30 minutes, then the worst thing happened, I vomited up everything I had eaten all day. Including Indian food. I am currently still high [4 ] over 12 hours later so my typing may be all crazy. 




 I need concentration not energy. But I'll look into it. 




 I had an Adderall script for a while. But I'm trying to avoid another one. 




 Well I've taken 600mg 2 days in a row. Still no effect. 




 I'm a student. And you think I want to be lazy? I'm trying to find a way to solve it, by asking who I thought had some concept knowledge on the subject. 




 So it doesn't matter how the word was intended to be used, but only how it was perceived? 




 5 hours now. Absolutely no effects were felt. 




 What are site confirmed to have fake adrafinil? And what exactly does adrafinil really look like?
I bought 5 grams from powdercity and it's a very pale pink color. The reason I ask is because I didn't feel anything after 600mg dosage. 

Any help is appreciated. 




 Concentration and being more alert
