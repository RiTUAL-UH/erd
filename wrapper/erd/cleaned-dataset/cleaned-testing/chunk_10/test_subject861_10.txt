 I think Salinger intentionally left the end of Holden's story as an ambiguous one that could be interpreted one of two ways:

**1) Optimistic:** Holden is doing much better, enjoying life more, and genuinely missing people. He will be headed to a new school soon and he is looking forward to that.

**2) Pessimistic:** Holden is just as deluded and disconnected as ever before. He thinks he is getting out of the psych ward soon, but it is just a false hope. The telling of his story shows the current state of his mental health, and it is not a good diagnosis.

*How did you interpret the conclusion of The Catcher in the Rye?* 




 Yeah. A year and a half ago we bought a "dwarf mix" bunny. I guess the dwarf was mixed with a giant because she is *not* small! 














 That's exactly what I did. Though I had enough money to pass that check as well. 




 I had a room in Novac fairly early in my run. Still prefer it to the presidential suite.  




 The only mods I use are ones that enhance aesthetics. I don't have any that affect gameplay. 




 I didn't check. I had a lot though but that wasn't from mere scavenging. I kind of have no qualms about using the merchant exploit for more caps. 




 It was a blast! (especially when I met the Boomers...) 




 It wasn't entirely intentional that I am just now entering The Strip. I followed where I felt the game was leading me all the way down south then east before heading up north to Freeside. Once there, I had other quests to take care of that to me as far north as Nellis AFB and as far west as Jacobstown.

 I just spent the last thirty minutes listening to the voice actors you've listed above. You are an *incredible* voice caster. I hope you're hired! 




 Our Secret Santa sent us not one, not two, but THREE cookbooks all uniquely meeting our personalities and palates!

**eat tweet** - A Twitter cookbook, each recipe pulled directly from Twitter and all under 140 characters.

**A Taste of Puerto Rico** - An authentic taste of a region unlike our own.

**The Butch Bakery Cookbook** - Hundreds of cupcake recipes that are delightfully different and dangerously delicious.

Thank you Santa! Our tummies will be pleasantly full for years to come! 









 I'm finding this summer sale somewhat underwhelming. There have been few games that have excited me and the sales themselves haven't been that impressive. 


Does anyone else feel the same way?  




 I'm not sure if you've decided yet, but here is the opinion of a mega fan who has played each game in the series:


Begin with  **Final Fantasy X**. 


The graphics are new enough to not be offensive or distracting to modern gamers. The story and world are both beautiful works of art. The cast of characters is unique while each party member still holds traditional JRPG roles. It's the first voice-acted Final Fantasy, so there are some flaws there, but still a great game overall.  




 There you are! I've been waiting for your posts! 




 I didn't even know it existed. When I came across it at the store tonight I had to make myself a spot on the floor and spend some time with it. It has original artwork and tons of incredible information. 

I took a few pics:

 How did the new Wolfenstein turn out? This is the lowest it's ever been discounted. Is it worth it? 




 /u/lakinwecker I'm counting on you. 









 Thank you /u/Anatidaephobic_Duck for the source! I have made a brief list below of the potentially noticeable benefits of taking Fish Oil from the link you provided. Hopefully it will help others if they have the same question:

* Can stimulate brain activity.
* Can help combat muscle soreness.
* Supports healthy cholesterol.
* Can increase and strengthen bone density.
* Can benefit mood as it supports levels of serotonin.
* May help to balance blood pressure. 




 I have been taking Triple Strength Omega-3 Gold (1,000 mg EPA+DHA per gel) once or twice a day for a couple of weeks now. 

I'm not a huge supplement guy at all, but have read that taking a regular dose of fish oil is beneficial. So, I jumped on the bandwagon and got some high quality stuff. 

Should I be noticing any kind of change or difference in anything?  




 My gift has *been* shipped and is now on its way to me. I wonder... 




 LOVE its color! 




 Every account on reddit is a bot except you. 









 My wife is making me watch this on repeat...and I'm not complaining one bit. 




 I've got to get my bunny a party shirt! Where can they be found? 




 Babi is like, "Here we go again..." 




 Guys, our bunny's shedding is OUT OF CONTROL! 

It's not coming out in clumps and she isn't acting ill so I don't think that she is sick or anything. And it has only been going on for two weeks now. We just think that she is shedding her winter coat in preparation for summer. But it has never shed this much. 

There are flurries of bunny fur flying around the room. When we pet her, our hands look like hairy gloves. Her cage now has carpet.

**Is it normal for bunnies to shed this much!?** 









 Can you always speak for bunnies? Please and thank you. 














 All of creation groans and suffers and has been subjected to futility (Romans 8:22). Those that have faith in God have been promised a day coming where sickness, corruption, and all groaning will cease. 

For the believer in Christ, how could one afflicted as much as Peter *not* hold on to something as promising as that? For those in Christ, God has promised to guide all suffering for the good of his people (Romans 8:28). 

Peter, and those like him, might just have the audacity to believe that their life here on earth, as short and painful as it might be, is just the beginning of their existence. And what was not afforded to them here in this life, will be richly given to them in the next.


2 Corinthians 4:16 - "So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day." 




 Trust me, she doesn't freeze. In fact, we've never been able to get her on her back to where she goes into that catatonic state. In the position seen in this picture, she is cupped nicely with her feet firmly supported to where she feels comfortable. 




 Don't we all! 




 Don't be fooled! My bunny lets me do that for about thirty seconds before wanting down. I do a little bit each day hoping that one day she will let me and not fight it. 









 Final Fantasy XIII's scene and sound is both breathtaking and tear-jerking in my opinion: [**Final Scene**](https://youtu.be/bn14Bu8vl5g?t=3m54s)

The sacrifice of friends. The return of others. The hope gained and the hope lost. It doesn't get much better.

 Ripped completely from a current Ask Reddit thread and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yfvv0/if_achievements_popped_up_in_front_of_you_like/cp9b7cg) specific comment. 




 Hey, this one is really good and really concise. Great jorb. 




 This sounds like the protagonists are the worst people ever. 




 **FF7**: Mercenary for hire joins terrorist organization to stop corrupt company. Hero dresses like a woman, may or may not have sex with a dude, and befriends a cat-robot. Real bad guy is not corporation, but man with long sword. [Girlfriend dies.](/spoiler) Meteor summoned. Surprise! Hero is not who he thought he was. Revitalized hero leads team to kill bad guy and save the world.
