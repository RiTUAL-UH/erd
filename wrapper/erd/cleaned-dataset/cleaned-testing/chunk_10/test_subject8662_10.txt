 Getting really annoying.  




 Not technically TESD but Bryan's guest spots on Smodcast 85 (Side Chair) and 207 (The Bryining) are particularly hysterical. One of the only podcasts I've ever listened to multiple times. 




 No 














 Confirmed fact vs Allegation.  




 Plastics 




 As much as being a judgemental dick was part of yours. 




 BEADS 




 Beads? 




 "I Know Things Now" is one of my favorite songs and with the way they're altering Red and The Wolfs dynamic, I can't see it carrying the same weight going from "I was just raped" to "I just met some dude who was kinda mean."  




 Studio wants Sondheim and the brand recognition.  




 No no, as with most things, needs more wolf penis.  









 "Love love love the books Mr Martin but instead of cutting neds head off maybe joffrey just sends him to his room for a while and he doesn't get any candy or anything like that but maybe we check in on him every once in a while and he's totally on restriction and stuff but that gives us a chance to have him make a comeback later." 









 Took me six years for my second attempt but I was always a bit slow.  




 On the one hand that's awesome because everyone's alive, on the other hand Who the hell let's an 11 year old play GTA?! 




 But you would say in either situation it's more difficult. Just genuinely curious, anecdotally. Like even if a father is well versed in how the female body works are their struggles when dealing with puberty/menstruation, ditto for mothers with sons?  




 I'm working towards being a screen writer and my father, not raised in the most enlightened of atmospheres, has said he thinks I should do a story about the challenges of a same sex couple raising a child of the opposite gender. I didn't think that would be that interesting as I didn't see that there would be that much difference from a regular couple; he thinks issues of sex and puberty would be more difficult to go over without a member of the opposite sex. What are your experiences? Is it that different from your heterosexual friends or is my dad completely off base? 




 Kev, First off thanks for all that you do, the pods and the flicks have been a huge influence on me.
Second, This is a tired ass question but very important to me right now so if you'll allow, I write screenplays with a partner and we're nearing completion on a few we're pretty satisfied with. I know you're all about the get a camera and do it yourself and we would love to but we don't have the money, time, equipment, or talent pool to draw from. If we're going the "old Hollywood route" what's our best bet for getting our stuff out there and maybe getting some representation/work? 




 Surprised I haven't seen this here but Jaws. Chemistry is just perfect.  




 Literally says who it's by right at the top dude. 




 Actually speaking as someone who works in a customer service line, I have no idea how things work at Comcast but everywhere I've ever worked our priority has always been handling customer calls as quickly and thoroughly as possible. If you don't have a monopoly on a certain area of business your goal is customer satisfaction.  




 Don't know where else to post this story so I'll try commiserating with yall. I ordered a year in time portrait for my mother On Dec 2nd from the website www.plowhearth.com/ after a little over a week I emailed, and received a response stating i had to allow 3 weeks, which was not stated anywhere on their site. After another week and a half I called and was routed to the shipping department (bad sign.) The shipping department said they would leave a message with Service and I would receive a callback tomorrow. This process repeated itself three more times up until today, where they said that it had shipped fedex direct and no tracking information was available. So my gift for my mother has yet to arrive with 30 hours to Christmas. Do not order from plow   hearth if you need your order inside of a month apparently. So reddit, what's your story?
 














 Sorry, this is the hundredth time you've seen this today I'm sure but I just want to say I found your depression post about two weeks after I was diagnosed. You were an amazing help in getting me through the early stages and explaining what I was feeling to my family. 

No questions just, you're awesome.

Also I sent you an email like a year and a half ago that I later realized came off super creepy so... sorry about that. 

Keep getting better.  




 I ever so humbly apologize for daring to post a video I happened to miss a year ago. I was working under the foolish assumption that there might be people who exist who missed it or perhaps weren't even members at the time. I beg your forgiveness.  









 I'm not sure if you're trolling or a moron but if you're a moron: It's playing on the joke of Joel being the reluctant parent figure that makes up the first two thirds of the game. [This is to set up the third act reversal in spring where he finally accepts her as his daughter right after her innocence is lost after the near rape](/spoiler) Grunting and gasping is just indicative of the brilliant sound design as when humans have to climb, run, and haul things, they grunt and gasp.

If you're just trolling: Carry on.  




 For the past few years I've pretty much just gotten gaming news and reviews on my news feed from g4. Since they are shutting down, what are some decent review and news sites that I can look into? 




 Posted on your last AMA, hoping you catch it this time. Can you settle an argument between my friend and I? Do you consider the ending of Clerks 2 to be a happy ending, or do Dante and Randle realize that they regret the purchase of the quick stop? 









 We live in Tallahassee FL, and are looking at cutting ties with comcast but do not want to loose internet speed. In terms of customer service and internet speed, how do they compare?

 Then leave. People like you make reddit so much worse than the things you complain about

 How? How is this a problem? Just move the fuck on. It does not effect your life, it takes you ten seconds to realize you've seen it before an move on. I haven't so I laughed.
