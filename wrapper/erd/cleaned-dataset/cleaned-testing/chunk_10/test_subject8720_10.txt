 Okay.   




 Me? I'm okay I guess... 




 This probably isn't the best example, but it's the only one I can really think of right now. To give you some context, I was at work and I was really struggling. It was like I wasn't even there, like a zombie. I worked through the motions of what needed to be done but I barely even have a thought to what was happening or what I was doing. It was a bad day. Anyway, I knew I had to do something, or else I would go home to an empty house and continue to feel empty and bereft. After work, I called up a friend I hadn't really spoken to for a couple of weeks; he's always up for anything and loves to explore. So, I asked him to pick me up and I directed him to an abandoned railway tunnel I had found near my house when I was younger. All I really told him was that I was having a bad day and needed to DO something. The railway tunnel is covered in graffiti you see, so I picked a blank space and added my own graffiti: 'I am alive'. After that I decided to hang out with him and his friends who I hadn't met. While I remained pretty melancholy for the rest of the day, just doing something so out of the ordinary shocked me. It brought me out of the quiet, dark place my mind had gone. It was almost like I had been holding my breath and had finally remembered to breathe again. I'm not saying you should go out and graffiti or anything. Just do something like calling a friend you haven't spoken to in a while. Go for a walk somewhere you're not familiar with. Explore.  




 Thank you. I'm surprised by the comments I've received. I didn't really realise that there are other people who feel the same way as I do. Sometimes, I do try to make an effort to go out and do things, even if they're on my own, but more and more lately I find myself just opting to stay at home. I feel like I only make an effort because that's what I'm supposed to do. It's my responsibility to do my best to get better. 

I wish you luck with your meds. Don't be afraid to talk to your doctor about trying different ones if those ones don't work for you. And give them time to work I guess. And you're right, they don't give you back the 'meaning' in your life, they only even out the emotions for you so you can find/create that meaning yourself. It's hard and it's frustrating but it's possible.  




 I've been there too many times, I know what you mean. It just gets harder and harder to break free from the almost cozy darkness. Loneliness, for me at least, is so familiar. It's easier. I try not to let myself get into that kind of thinking, but I guess sometimes I just get so tired of having to try so hard to be 'happy'.  




 I understand what you mean. Sometimes, I find myself getting lost in the moment and enjoying myself, but not as often as I'd like at this stage in my recovery. More often than not, everything seems so meaningless, like you said. I guess the only way to try and not feel like this is to do things that shock you into feeling...so doing things outside of your comfort zone. It's what I've had to do a few times...but it doesn't always work :( 




 Definitely the live version of Latch by Sam Smith - he's an angel  




 I'll make sure to! I'm just watching the second season of Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru at the moment (and loving it!) so that's next on my to-watch list! :D 




 I think it's hard to say. On one hand, it's hard not to think that any friends you make who are also depressed are simply there for the pity party. Misery loves company. Speaking from experience, putting a group of depressed teenagers together eventually creates a somewhat toxic, but understanding environment. People who are going through the same thing as you won't judge you, and will be able to understand you on a level most people won't be able to. However, it's a sad truth I've come to understand that it's hard to recover alongside someone else at the same time. For me, their recovery became more important than my own. Their depression almost ratified my own, making it a real and tangible part of my life.
