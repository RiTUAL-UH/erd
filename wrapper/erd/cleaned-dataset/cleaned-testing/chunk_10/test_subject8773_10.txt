Thats the article I got it from :) 









 ....what? How do the two even relate to one another? Threatening to break up the family unless you do chores while on crutches?  Okay... 




 All of my what. 




 I really should. Shes tried to contact me to tell me shes "praying for me" and that she forgives me. First of all, if youre praying for me, i dont need to know. Second of all, forgive me for what?? Im not the crazy psycho abusive person here.   




 I think it looks great, actually, judging from the picture you took of your profile. If you want your septum to show a little more, maybe request that your jewelry get changed to something longer?
 




 Haha i honestly do not know. 




 EDIT: Thanks everyone for your responses. I want to give you all so many hugs...


I have a couple that come to mind.

"You're an evil, spoiled, ungrateful brat. You should be ashamed of yourself, because I am."--don't even remember what I did, but i was 9 years old.


"Fuck you, then. If you want to be a failure, then fine by me. I don't need you. I have four other kids."--said to me as a junior in high school after I got two Cs on my report card. She was basically forcing me to help raise my four younger siblings while I was enrolled in all IB classes, and I was depressed and was not getting any treatment. The five other grades I had were As.


"What is wrong with you? Can't you see you're making a spectacle of yourself? You just want attention! Go where no one can see you!"--We were at a family friend's 30th anniversary party and I had broken up with my first long-term college boyfriend the day before. The couple's first dance came on and I shed a couple happy yet sad tears.


"I'll assume you were sexually assaulted. That sucks. But you need to stay here and work on our relationship, you do not have the right to leave whenever you please and do what you want. I am your mother and you live in this house. No daughter of mine will live in sin."--after I tried to stand up to myself over winter break during and tell her I was leaving to go live with my boyfriend and his family because our house was a toxic environment. I told her that while I was away at college I was diagnosed with a couple mental illnesses, and that I had some traumatic things happen to me, and I needed a different environment so I wouldn't go overboard and kill myself. She still hasn't said more about it than that. The worst part is that she worked in a sexual assault crisis center as an ADVOCATE and she has helped countless people get counseling and support. My little sister was sexually assaulted and Nmom pursued legal action against him for two years. My mother was sexually assaulted as well and has traveled to different conferences speaking about it. My brother is depressed and she got him on medication and to counseling right away. But of course, all my depressed symptoms happen because I'm dramatic, lazy, and attention-seeking. Projection, much?


"Yeah and now I have to take off of work for this bullshit. Shes so dramatic, I wish she would grow up."--I overheard her say this on the phone after I had an emotional/nervous breakdown of some sort. She kept trying to force me to hug her and made it worse. I kept screaming no at the top of my lungs but she wouldnt let go of me. I was a crying, PTSD ridden mess. Later that day, when I tried to leave to my boyfriend's house (again) she called his mother (I was 19 at the time so WTF??) and told her "You're gonna tell her that she can't live with you. You've never seen the other side of her, the one where she won't hug her own mother. She's awful."


"I rebuke you and your evil ways! Get the fuck out of my house! Ungrateful! Selfish! Whore! Live in sin, for all i care, I wash my hands of you! You're dead to me!"--said to me after she beat me and screamed at me for ten minutes this Christmas Day for suggesting the men get up and help us out. I went to my boyfriends house, where I now live with his family during breaks.


I'm sure she's said more horrible things than that to me. These were the more landmark ones. You know how narcs are, they will say tiny things that cut into you that you can't really explain to other people because you come off as petty otherwise. What's the worst thing your narc's ever said to you?


EDIT: Edited for chronological order and to put in a couple more things. 









 Oh my god, I am so sorry for the loss of your baby brother. This is absolutely disgusting. As a person who almost lost my little brother to suicide as well, I don't know how you didn't fucking rip her vocal chords out so she could never say something so incredibly insulting like that ever again. What mother fucking says that about her child, "how could he do this to us?" 

I hope you're doing okay, my heart goes out to you.  




 She has no right to be asking for handouts, as you've indicated that she's done, and I don't know her particular situation, but she sounds a lot like my own mother. I am the eldest of five children. We were raised on her single income. We were poor when there was just us three kids, but she had two more. (Incredibly stupid.) The difference is that my mom got a degree, and made barely enough money to keep the electric on every month and to be independent from handouts from the family.

It doesn't excuse your sisters behavior at all, but this time she is going through right now is super rough, even if its brought on by herself. It's going to make it even harder to pick herself up because she hasn't made anything of herself, she has three kids already (depressing as hell), and she has a bun in the oven that was put there by a father who can't help her out. 

You have a right to be frustrated, as she has made some very stupid decisions but its pretty hard to get out of the kind of hole she has dug herself and it doesn't sound like she has the moxy to do it. Just trying to come at it from a different perspective to help you with the anger you're feeling, justified as it may be. 




 I don't remember eating Honey Nut Feelios today 




 Well, I wouldn't sit there and try to explain yourself, because they have already made the stance that anything she does, you should try to maintain a relationship with her because "She's your mother!!"

This is a logical dead-end for them. I say stick with the succinct response you offered just now, and if they don't support you, and are going to attack you anyway, you don't really need them either, since they'll be stressing you out even more, no matter what you say to them. 




 You know, the fact that you're even agonizing over this, over someone who has hurt you a lot in the past, shows that you are a good person who is still able to try and see things for what they are, instead of twisting them around like Ns do.

Also, most people desire a relationship with their families, ESPECIALLY after they have kids of their own. You're not some fickle, bratty, hormonal teenager who doesn't appreciate their parent. I don't think that most people on this subreddit can say that they didn't wish they had more "normal" parents that they can go to for advice, emotional support, or things like that. The fact that you feel something is wrong, and need to create more extensive boundaries with someone who is flesh and blood says something.

The sad part is not many people understand this, especially with the subtle (to other people) abuse of an Nparent. Please, do what is right for you and for your daughter. You have dealt with your Nmom for your whole life, you know her games, and you know how to avoid participating in those games. 

What I'm saying is, trust yourself, and don't let the family push you to do something you don't feel is right for you.  




 If you would like, you can go read the post I am referring to right [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2z4vum/mother_apologized_i_had_my_suspicions_and_now_i/)

Anyway, after not speaking for nearly a month, I get a text from her saying "Your on my heart today...hoping you have a really great day!"

After the initial cringe at the improper use of "your", I got incredibly angry. I was in class and my heart started beating really fast and I couldnt focus for the rest of the time. I was swept right back into the time when I was living with her and dealing with all of the awful things she said and did to me.

Im also angry because she fucking ignored me the last time I saw her when she hadn't seen me or heard from me months after she (quite literally) kicked me out of the house on Christmas day. 

She doesn't get to fucking pretend that because she apologized, she can just go around pretending that that was enough. She needs to act like she is sorry around me. 

And im fairly sure the only reason she texted me that is so that she can show all her crazy church friends how ungrateful and horrible I am when I dont respond to it, perpetuating all the lies she's probably told them.

Ugh, even getting a text from her gives me the heebie jeebies but I have to keep her number in my phone because its the only way I can check up on my siblings. 




 I like this a lot, even more because it was written by a mother. 




 To be fair, that's some pretty good blending. What makes it awful is how white and prominent her highlight is, and of course, those eyebrows. 




 this is really clever lol 




 Awwww *hugs* 




 My whole life, I honestly did not know that I could go through life without becoming a mother, and I'm so glad I found this subreddit before I went and had kids. 

See, I love kids, but there's a difference between enjoying them when they are at their best, and actually raising them. I believe many people, like me, confuse the two.

When I first came here, I organized it by "top posts of all time" and just started reading for hours. I was amazed. I never had the desire to actually ***raise*** children but I didn't realize it until I came here. (Or become pregnant, which is another terrifying matter all on its own.) 

It sounds silly but you all saved my life. I now know that I am childfree, and that means I have freedom, finances, and my identity, which sadly, many parents lose when they have kids. Thank you all!

 




 I was walking to class this morning, and there were two girls behind me talking about going home for Easter. The conversation went as follows:

* Girl 1: Are you going home for Easter? It's so stupid for our spring break to be a different week than Easter weekend, but I'm going anyway because obviously, that's family time.

* Girl 2: Yeah, I am. I don't think Julia is though. I mean I get that she has a psycho family but I would never ever miss a holiday, why would you do that? It seems kind of selfish.

* Girl 1: Yeah, I totally agree, I think she's blowing it way out of proportion.

These girls sounded like her roommates, and I feel really bad for her, knowing that she's not going to have any support from her friends to get away from her possibly toxic family. I was in the exact same position with my family last year, and spent Easter with my friend's family. I really feel for you Julia, wherever you are. :/ 




 You should submit this to /r/tifu lol
 









 Annoy: When the teacher is condescending. I love some good ol' sarcasm, but there's a difference between being funny and being an asshole.

Respect: Is patient when I come to ask questions all of the time. I've had professors that were visibly annoyed that I came to their office hours all the time. What are you doing teaching if you don't want to teach?? 




 I have younger siblings, so I asked them all to give me a random word and this is what they came up with. 

I was devastated when it was brought to my attention that I could have been named "horny green alien" instead.  




 This is unrelated but god damn your username is giving me some serious cravings  




 No, i wasnt, but still. A kid making loud huffy bored noises and touching books with their dirty snotty sticky fingers is still not okay 




 I dont understand how people can have such poor judgement.

In that second case, the manager was definitely doing something illegal if those kids were in the US. The manager would never hire a kid that young so why would you let a kid work that young?? 









 I'm sorry to hear that :/ I hope as the years come you will be able to find more peace 




 Thanks :)
 




 Yeah, I'm just waiting for that day when it will stop disappointing me so much. 




 Im on mobile so I dont know how to post a link, but you can go back into my post history to find the "apology" my Nmom gave me about a week ago. 

Anyway, after all that i told my mom i was going to come see my younger siblings yesterday, and she was super pleasant on the phone, everything seemed fine. She told me she wouldnt be there that day because she was getting her hair done (microbraids, so it takes like 6+ hours). 

Well i showed up around 5:30, and she gets home about 20 mins later, and goes straight into the house without saying hi to me and my bf, and sits in the house while everyone else is outside talking and playing with the kids.

Eventually we go inside and she doesnt even acknowledge our presence until we say we are going  to get going, to which she says, "Oh, bye." 

Now i know i was right to be suspicious. I have a feeling she only apologized to save face with her church friends and because its the lenten season. 

Also, to add insult to injury, she told me she was going to give me the car they never use so that i could drive to work/go grocery shopping/get back and forth from school, but i showed up and it was gone. They sold it and are going on vacation with the money. 

Fuck it, dont want your shit anyway, Nmom. 




 Very true 




 Thank you, this is very helpful. I think I'll use this model for myself in the future :)
