 Here is a quote from another article:   

More convincingly, however, was the analysis of the male skeleton. He was judged to be around 45 when he died, matching the age at which Philip was killed, but he was also found to have suffered a severe wound to his knee three years before his death.

This is consistent with reports of Philip's life: "As Philip was returning to Macedonia from the Scythian campaign against Ateas, the Thracian tribe of Triballoi met him and refused to allow him passage unless they received a share of the spoils," the researchers wrote. "Hence, a dispute arose and afterward a battle, in which Philip received so severe a wound through his leg by a lance that his horse was killed by it.

Analysis showed the male in Tomb I had leg bones with a stiffened knee joint, signs of bone fusion and a hole through the knee indicating a piercing wound. "Therefore, Philip's lameness is conclusive evidence for the identification of one tomb occupant as Philip."

 This is confusing me. I found the pic on the official NASA website right here i think http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-135/ndxpage1.html  

I apologize if i got this wrong.
 




 Don' t get me wrong. I am on your side. Someone much smarter than me (Dr David Livingston) once said, and i quote:   

*Manned space exploration is absolutely worth the investment. Its not just about what we learn out there in space, or about ourselves, or how to be a better steward of precious Earth. Its about how we live here on Earth together and what type of future we want for ourselves and children. Manned space exploration is the path to how we build a better life for ourselves here on Earth, and how we can give hope and provide inspiration for our youngsters to grow up, do the schoolwork, and accept the challenges that await them to make our world even better. Whatever we spend on manned space exploration is a bargain and our investment will be returned to us many times over, both quantitatively and qualitatively. From my perspective, we are getting this value at a bargain, as if we were all going to the dollar store for an end of the year sale.*   

But we both don't fund NASA. I still hope the journey into space will continue and Roscosmos and Nasa actually will be working together on the programme of a future space station. 




 Nervermind. I thought that reference would be easy to understand. 




 But in times like today with all the economic problems it has to be a legitimate questionif space exploration is worth the cost.

 'I see stuff from the future, and Im such a futurist that I have to slow down and talk in the present.'

 First i was thinking to reply is a bad idea. But then i remembered Ralph Emerson who once said: he who is not everyday conquering some fear has not learned the secret of life.  

And i was like, fu*k it. This one is for you, OP!
