 My Dad would bring me to the bar with him when I was a kid. Would sit at the bar beside him with a Dr.Pepper and play hearts or spades with the woman who owned the place.

It was the 80's. Never saw a fight in there and the people who owned it was my cousins grandmother.

 Me and this guy who is a underground rapper from Memphis was playing checkers in an abandoned trailer one night back in 1997. He started beating me and I got pissed off, took the checker board and chunked that shit in the air. Well after we picked all those checkers up, he got knocked upside the head by a checker that came outta nowhere A MINUTE AFTER WE PICKED THEM ALL UP.

 This is what I remember. Way back in 2002, I was working in the Pet Department and my job was to catch fish out of the aquarium. The fair was in town and when the fair is in town, it is BATSHIT crazy. All these kids winning goldfish and their parents would go in Wal-Mart to get fish bowls,food,etc. Well, one day after I got off lunch (I was eating at McDonalds in my store because no car) and my stomach was..lets say not playing nice with me. A woman with her Grandson came in with a bag of goldfish and wanted someone to catch a specific one as a mate to the one he won at the fair. I'm off to the floor, they call my name, I go straight to the aquariums. The lady wanted a fish out of the goldfish tank that had a stripe over the eye. Now, mind that the tank had 1000 goldfish and that catching the specific one is time consuming. I'm over at the tanks FOR 4 GOD DAMN HOURS trying my balls off to catch this fucking fish. Her kid is at the tank ohh and ahhing. The Grandparent is over there placing her fingers on the glass THE WHOLE GOD DAMN TIME pointing out this bastard. Stomach made a noise, then I fuckin farted. Loud. I mean it echoed down the aisle. As this gas was rumbling in the bowels of my ass hell, I tried to fake a cough. I farted, fake cough was off by 2 seconds. I didnt do shit but ignore it. I farted, we glanced at each other and no big deal was made. It stunk, I mean worse than dead fish. So, the next day I come in, manager calls me up. I go in, he is asking me questions about me being rude. I'm like..what do you mean? He explained to me that I was being rude in front of a customer. "What?". "How?" No response. I got fired, next day I get a call from a guy I worked with that explained to me that because of my loud, smelly fart I got wrote up and fired. Escorted off the premesis and signed papers saying I will never work with them again. 









 Boomerang Bow Ties. 




 The speed of dark. 




 I used to call people from Craigslist at 3 in the morning. It went like this.

Me - You still got that Chevy Citation for sale?

Guy - Why the fuck you calling me at 3 AM?

Me - You didn't say what time not to call.

I also would call Sonic and ask if they still had any specials on Big Macs.


EDIT : Once called Ms.Cleo. She asked me my name. 
"Bitch, you the psychic. You're supposed to know" 




 I watched a guy walk in the park with a mask on few days ago.

 Politicians are so full of shit. Wharton is just Herenton in a better suit.

Herenton used to have a private room at the Hilton downtown and I wouldn't doubt if Wharton does too. 




 I have no clue but I been listening to Local X alot more. It has that 93X vibe to it. 




 Are you serious? What about the hotels  there? 




 Fun fact : Homeless people get robbed in Memphis too. 




 Trigger alert. 




 They already had people breaking into cars there. 




 Everything I learned about Memphis was from the Wake Up Crew on Rock 103. RIP Bad Dog and 93X. 




 Lead singer of Poison was arrested there for mooning the crowd or something there once.
Was Ozzy playing a concert there and after the concert he was arrested for pissing on Beale? Or was it the time he freaked the fuck out after a concert and they found Ozzy on I-240 drunk and naked?

Fun Fact: Judas Priest recorded a live album at the Mid-South Coliseum. Same place where Jerry Lawler fought Andy Kaufman.

 No Timecop? 




 Any Deftones album. 




 I seen someone download the Beatles Discography once. 




 I got flashbacks to 80's Transformers with that one Dino bot Jet. 




 The Star Wars reprint has a black Diamond price box on the cover. I should know, I bought a 3 pack of the first 3 issues of Star Wars in a 3 pack for a buck in the early 90's.
Wish I still had the reprints. I know a comic shop in Jackson,Tn has issue 1 but it's sunburnt. 




 Local Goodwill here quit selling VHS tapes and tube TVs. 




 I have a metric fuckton of 60s-00s Richie Rich and Hot Stuff comics in the same shape. I usually sell them for 25 cents each because not much of a demand here for kid books.

 What kind of work are you doing now and what shows did you work on?

I have 2 cousins who work in Hollywood I never met. One is (or was) a lead singer in a band that peaked in the late 90's during Nu-Metal. 




 Overlord sounds like Alice In Chains for some reason. 
But Lamb Of God kicks major ass. 




 HORSE The Band, Toxic Holocaust, Crobot, All That Remains, Graveyard. 




 Five Finger Death Punch is better than St. Vincent or the rest of that hipster shit.

 Try Foo Fighters on classic rock stations. 




 I seen a Mountain Dew X-Box at a pawn shop in West Tennessee few years back. Someone bought it and it's still in the wild. 




 I used to live in Frayser back in the 90's. I was there recently and it looks like Detroit.
