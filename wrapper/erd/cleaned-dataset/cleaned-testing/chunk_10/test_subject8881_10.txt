 Doesn't work? 




 Yes. They even did something similar in TBBT, when Sheldon had to choose between a Xbox One and a PS4.

Hope that helps.  




 Just watched the first episode and it was amazing. Its sad that they stopped it.  




 It was set to NSFW automatically I guess, because of mentioning 'NSFW' in the title.  




 I see that a lot of you face this problem, based on [this earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dhnmo/there_something_seriously_wrong_with_youtube/). 
Adding the '/?gl=US' will set your country to US. If you are using the YouTube app instead, just go to the settings and change your country to Worldwide. This should work.  




 I totally agree with almost everything that you say and I'm a big fan of Kubrick, but I still do not see these two scenes being specifically related in any way. I do not think the writers/directors sat down and thought about connecting these two scenes the way you guys are trying to. 

I have watched all the episodes of Mr Robot till now at least 3 times, and I'm in on every single detail. You can check my history if you want. And I still think you are guys thinking about this one way too much, probably become you have been influenced by how smart and well thought out the show has been till now. 

If I were to direct these two scenes, I would do them in the exact same way. In the first scene, Elliot is making a big move, taking on something big, which is going to have an impact on his life, and it makes complete sense for him to take this "one last hit". It naturally follows to place the morphine powder as a long single line, to reflect on its significance/scale.  

In the last scene, the guys are on their way to the Steel Mountain and its the final cut of the episode. This scene is kinda of cliche in movies and tv shows where a road travel to a destination is involved and the scene is the final cut or cuts to a different scene. It naturally follows to shoot the scene the way it was. 

I would not change anything about these two scenes. But to me, all you guys are really doing is, connecting two line segments that make a lot of sense as individual scenes. 

There were a lot of great and well thought of scenes in this episode, but I just cannot see the connection you guys are trying to making between these two as one of them. 

 




 Ya I got that. I still feel you are guys are thinking way too much about this. The scene where the they give him the "Raspberry Pie" was totally something the writers have put some thought into. But this, I don't think the guys really sat down and thought about this the way you guys are thinking about it.  




 IMO, this was the best episode yet. So much stuff to absorb that I'll probably have to watch it two more times for it to completely sink in. This show is totally on par with GOT and other amazing shows on my top 5 list.   




 How are the two even related? Am I missing something? 




 The 420 one is the only hidden command. The rest are the ones already given : 
-help
-fsociety
-inform
-question
-wakeup
-join
and 
-420 




 This is interesting.
