 I apologize for any formatting issues because I am on mobile and in the dark, but I wanted to share this with the world before my phone dies, or I do.  I lived in an old house, but I was still surprised when yesterday, rearranging my room while going through things in preparation for college, I found a slit in the wall behind my dresser.  Although I had rearranged things in my room before, I had actually never moved that dresser.  


Since it just looked like a dark, solid line, I ran my finger along the slit to make sure it wasnt just a stain or a mark from the dresser being in one spot for so long.  But no, although it felt rather smooth, there was definitely a crack.  I took out my phone and shined the flashlight in there to see if I could see anything.  I could only distinguish vague beams and shapes of what appeared to be an attic-like space.


This was on the wall which faced the hallway, so I went out my bedroom door to investigate.  My room was at the very end of the hallway, with two of my other walls having windows to the outside.  In the hall, directly adjacent to my room, coinciding with where the slit would be, was the hall closet.  I was aware of this, but I opened the hall closet to see about how deep it was.  I went back into my room to compare this with the distance from my doorframe to the slit.  It was pretty close, so it was possible that I was seeing, from the slit, into the space behind the closet, or perhaps just the interior of the wall.  


No, I thought.  If it was just the interior of the wall, then the flashlight would have lit it up better, as the backing of the wall would be right there.  In any case, if there was such a space behind the closet, it would have to be quite narrow, as my bedroom closet, with my clothes in it, began about a foot to the left of this slit, and extended to about half the depth of the hall closet.  The closet in my parents bedroom, across the hall, mirrored this, and I presumed that they meet in the middle, behind the closet.  So, there could be no more than a foot of space in between.  


I ran my fingers over the slit again, wondering what might have made it, when I felt something at the top.  I had only tentatively touched it before, to see if it was real.  This time, running the length of the slit, I felt a corner at the top.  Shining my light on it, I could barely make out a thin line running to the right for about two and half feet.  It was a door.


This was extremely puzzling, since the hall closet should have occupied half of the space which this doorway would open up to.  


Although it was creepy, and mysterious, I was not afraid.  I had read and watched enough horror stories to know that, in any case, I should not open this alone, so I called for my mom. 


She came and I showed her the door.  She had to touch it herself to believe it, although, she had never moved that dresser either, since this was the most logical spot along the wall for it to sit, we had never had the need to.  Apparently it, along with a couple of other pieces of furniture had come along with the house.  She had tried to tell the previous owner to keep them, since we had our own bedroom sets, but they had insisted.  Now, she speculated, that this hidden damage to the wall may be the reason.  She wasnt as convinced as I was that it was a door, but decided there was no harm in pulling on it to see if it opens.  


Together, we grabbed it from the slit.  Our fingers didnt even fit into the slit, so with what little grip we could get on the door, we had to lean and use our feet for leverage.  Pulling on it like that, there actually seemed to be pressure on the right side, holding it back.  So then, we tried pushing it to the right.  Slowly, but surely, it opened, sliding like a closet door behind the rest of the wall, which was, as we could now see, much thinner than we had realized.  We stepped back and peered into the bare wood and beams of the large, dark, attic-like room.  I shined my flashlight inside.   In the far, left corner, there was an old rocking chair, covered in dust.  The space was only about four feet wide, which was about two feet wider than should have been possible.  Although that could be chocked up to misestimation on my part as to where the hall closet ended in relation to my wall, the depth of the room could not.  It seemed to extend far beyond the hallway, into space which should have been occupied by my parents room.   There also seemed to be a break in the wall to the left.


We werent quite sure what to do.  I had already taken a picture of the doorway and the room, with its impossible proportions.  The next logical step was to go in and investigate.  My mom didnt want me to go in alone, but I knew better than for both of us to go in at once.  The door could close on us and trap us inside.  Thats when I got my brilliant idea.  I could go in with my flashlight, and she could stand in the doorway to make sure it doesnt close, and to watch my back.


Although she didnt feel good about it at first, she reluctantly agreed, and leaned against the right edge of the doorframe, where she could hold the door back if it did, somehow, try to close.  


I stepped in with my phone held high, illuminating the floor and room before me.  I felt a rippling draft as I passed through the doorway, but inside, the room, unfinished and exposed though it was, was actually quite warm.   


As I stepped in further, I gathered that the heat was coming from an unknown source in the back left corner, where the old, dusty, and empty rocking chair lay.  It was made of an amber colored wood, carved in a simple pattern, and with a dingy navy blue foam cushion sitting on the seat.


I got to the halfway point, and saw, to my left, a gap in the wall about one foot wide.  This was, I presumed, the space between my and my parents bedroom closets.  Although, again, this room seemed deeper than it ought to be, so, although I was halfway across it, I really ought to have been well into my parents room, so it could not have been the space between the closets.  But there it was.  Pitch black.  I shined my flashlight down the narrow way, but the air there was so thick with dust that all the beam did was illuminate the floating particles of dust, and lines of cobwebs, for a few feet, with only dark, vague shapes outlined in the distance. 


I turned to the left.  My mom was still in the doorway.  I could see into the light of my room.  Everything was still ok.  


I should have left the exploring for later.  We could have put a stopper in the doorway and waited for my dad to get home.    But Id had no reason so far to think anything was wrong.  So far, just heading straight down into the room, I could see my room and my mom, and she could see the old room and me.  If I wanted to check out the narrow gap to my left, however, that would have to change.  But, as long as she was still holding the door, it would be alright.  I was just going to go in a little ways to try and get an idea of how deep it is or if theres anything in there.  I told her so and she nodded ok and just told me to be careful.  I held up my flashlight.  At one foot wide, I had to walk sideways into the gap.  I kept my gaze fixed to the left and the light pointing my way, swatting down cobwebs as I went, slowly.  I had only taken about six steps when I heard an enormous WOOSH and a blood-curdling scream which was cut short by a loud thud.  


I backed out of the tiny corridor as quickly as I could while going sideways, and turned to face the door.  Except, it wasnt there.  


With the flashlight around eye-level, as Id kept it, I could see only the solid wooden inside of the wall.  I quickly panned the light down the center of the wall.  There was no slit to be seen.


Mom? Incredulously, I stepped closer to where the door should have been.  Mom? There was still no answer.  I continued to call to her in an increasingly louder and more panicked voice as I walked, jogged, then ran the last bit to the wall.  Mom! I screamed as I pounded on the wall.  


It had waited until we were separated, until we couldnt see each other, to close the door.  And she had screamed.  Whatever it was must have pushed her out of the way.  I had thought that, if the door were to close on me, it would be by some unseen force, but then, it occurred to me, that it could be some unseen creature.  Did it push her out of the way and leave the confines of this room when she screamed?  Or had it locked itself in here with me?


I was already breathing hard with panic at this point, but when my foot brushed against an object laying against the wall where there previously was none, I jumped back, startled, tripping on the wide-gapped bare floorboards, and landing with my bottom on my leg, facing the opposite corner from whatever Id encountered.  I knew this was bad.  My leg wasnt broken, of that I was fairly certain, but I had to get up slowly because it hurt to move it.  My phone had landed upside down by my feet, shining its narrow beam up at me.  As I picked it up and reflexively flipped it right side up, my eyes widened as the light hit the wet, red, tip of my shoe.


I brought my hand to my forehead to make sure I hadnt cut it.  Being right handed, and having the flashlight in that hand as well, this made the flashlight beam quickly pass over the wall and back to eye-level.  In that quick pass, I had seen hair.  I had not bumped into some invisible thing or unseen object.


I hobbled forward quickly.  My mom must have been unconscious, and she was clearly bleeding.  I needed to wrap something around her head. I had to lean and use my hands on the wall for support, so I could only see the floor and wall right by my feet.  Although I had seen the right side of my mom from the other side of the room, when I got to the corner by the door, I did not see her left, but rather her middle.  The door, in closing, had sliced her clean in half, vertically.  I collapsed in shock, landing on my knees in a pool of blood.  I had asked her to stand in the doorway, and now the right half of her was sealed in this room with me, and the left half of her was in my bedroom outside.  The exact measure that I thought would keep us both safe instead had her cut in half.  


After crying there in this agonizing irony of horror and guilt, I started to snap out of the shock and realized that I was locked in this mysterious, physically impossible room, with half the corpse of my mother, and I was kneeling in a pool of her blood.  What if they never find me.  Worst of all, finding half of her, no sign of a break-in, and no me, they might even think I killed her.  


I jumped up then, with the adrenaline kicking in helping to work against the pain in my leg, because I also remembered that I had no idea what had closed the door which did kill her, and that I had had my back turned to the rest of the room since it had happened.  I turned around and shined my light into the darkness.  The room, of course, was still empty.  The narrow hall to the left was still dark.  I could still make out the empty rocking chair in the back left corner of the room.  This time, however, the dust had been disturbed into a cloud around it, and it was swinging.
 




 I hope this does not get deleted like /u/M59Gar 's amazing sci-fi story.

This is just my un-edited flow of conclusions in terms of the Multiverse Theory with an afterlife focus, but I wrote it with this community in mind, so....

If this: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3duieo/quantum_lottery/   doesn't get deleted, then this here shouldn't either IMO.  Similar subject and slant... 









 unless you are employed by the state, which would include the prosecuting attorneys, as well as court-appointed defense attorneys, so at least 50% of the time, this may actually be an over-estimate.  It depends on the size of the city.   




 *spirit.  I am on the mobile site so there is no edit button 




 The "leave me alone" thing most people have mentioned works most of the time, provided the spirit is not interested in you personally.  It depends on the purpose/nature of the spirit.  

Take for example, the situation with my ex.  Shortly after we met, I found out about his ex who had died in a car crash.  This came up after I told him about the lovely dream I had in which at one point a woman I didn't know glared at me and stared me down.  I described her to him, and then he told me about her and that he was worried that would happen, as she had harassed the two girlfriends he'd had since her passing.  I later came to find out that she had been actively haunting him as well.  

I'm not going to go into my history or anything beyond the scope of this story, but when I told him I was going to get rid of her, he said his exes had tried and it didn't work.  I don't know what they tried, and there's no need to go over the altercation in detail, because there wasn't much of a confrontation or laughing at her or telling off like you alluded to in your question.  It was more like we both know what we're here for and I'm here to kick your *** out.  On both sides.  The next day when I saw him, he was shocked BC he hadn't seen or heard from her, and apparently didn't think I could get rid of her.  

It was then that I realized I had fallen in love with him, because I knew that I wouldn't have had the strength to win that fight otherwise.  

That being said, that was a personal matter.

To address your question in a more generic and appropriate way, you cannot just confront a sport, you have to be prepared both in terms of knowing exactly what you're dealing with and in terms of strength and resistance to the challenges and risks the spirit may bring your way.

So, with regards to personal strength, you must first have control of your own thoughts, both so that you can channel your strengths and so that you can tell when someone's trying to mess with your mind.  The basic starting exercise for this is to clear your mind and think of nothing.  The challenge here is control over the urge to fill the silence with "I'm thinking of nothing!" Or thoughts about your breathing.  Once you manage to work past that to where you can clear your mind for a good minute, establishing control over your thoughts (if you're squeamish or weak stomached, this will help you a lot to that end),  You must also, once you have mastered the first, learn how to protect yourself.  If you want to pursue that once you've become master of your own mind, feel free to pm me, or you could post in /r/energywork and ask perhaps about a basic aura shield, although no two people may tell you the same thing.   

To recap, to confront a spirit or entity of any kind, you must know exactly what you are up against, as much as possible, have control of your own mind so you can be sharp and know when someone is messing with you, and know most importantly how to defend and protect yourself (to which clearing your mind is a precursor).  

Only then, can you prepare the appropriate offensive strategy for the specific encounter. 




 I also have had recurring dreams about secret rooms.  Usually it was in the back of the closet of my parents bedroom, through a hidden door, and it went up (even though my house is one story).  Orinally, the first time I had a dream involving that place, like 10 years ago, it was just a small simple playroom.  The most recent one I had, in November or December, it was a complicated structure.  It had already become a two-story hideout in previous installments, but this time, during an alien invasion no less, it was incredibly spacious, with an extra secret backroom in the upstairs, behind a dining room, which even contained a closet, and I was hiding there, treating it as a bunker.  

If you look at it like any other dream, dreams are generally metaphors which reveal things we either subconsciously observed or picked up on but didn't consciously register, or things we've been thinking about subconsciously but don't want to admit.  

Not sure how this applies to recurring dreams about non existent, physically impossible, secret places though.  It depends on the specifics of the dream and your life.  For the ones about your home, it probably signified a desire for something more than your apartment life.

 Now I know what Kobalt can do for me that I can't do by self publishing on iTunes.  Thank you for sharing 




 I stand corrected, this is the original link https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1compp/6302967536/ 




 the voices are the souls of the souless staring people, the bald man is the devil or some sort of demon, and someone put a hit on you, probably losing their own soul in the process, and that's why you were hired via being contacted for an interview at 4am 




 thanks for the reading recommendation.  to anyone else here's the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1e2prk/boothworld_industries/ 




 when I first saw the title I got kind of mad because I was thinking it'd be something along the lines of a non-verbal autistic person speaking and turning out to be possessed or something.

This was actually a good story, and I love the way you started it because I can relate, because I am 10 years older than my brother, but he is on the mild end of the spectrum.  I completely relate to the third parent thing, although now that he's older and talking more, I can actually be more of a sister too. 




 This January, I had a dream, of the usual menagerie of fantastical nonsense, but then, towards the end, my mom told me we needed to go to WalMart to return a pack of socks.  We went and waited in line and everything.  

When I woke up in the morning, guess what my mom told me we needed to do?

Except, in the dream, the socks were white.  In real life, the socks were black.  But that's irrelevant.



That was the most direct precognitive dream I've ever had.  I've had many, but its always not exactly the same thing, more metaphorical, or similar but not identical. 

This is the first and only time so far that I've dreamed something and had it happen *exactly* that way.  And it was also about socks......


Maybe socks are some sort of key to the future. :) 




 sounding like your father could either make it a dead relative or something malicious trying to trick you.  There's also the question of whether the thing making the voices and the blue man are one in the same.  If not, then the first, talking spirit, may be attached to a family object that you moved with, and the second, blue spirit, may be attached to the new house, since it didn't appear until you moved.  If they are one in the same, it highlights the question of why did they leave you alone until your brother grew old enough to walk and talk and be understood?  If its a dead relative, maybe it wants to send a message to your father by scaring his young children?  maybe someone who didn't approve of the marriage?

other than that, I have no idea.  

did you take anything from the first house when you moved that was not yours before then, meaning that you found in the house (and you as in the whole family).  because if its not attached to a family item, the other explanation for following you would be that you happened to take the item it is attached to from the other house.  

Scratching the center of the basement made me think something was buried under the old house, but if that were the case, the spirit wouldn't have followed you to a new house.  so that is not likely the case. 




 that's good to know.   I'm American and I've only ever had frozen ones, and I thought they were amazing. 




 ouch, yeah at least the only thing I lost was some money.  That was a costly enough mistake that I'll be certain not to make it again. 




 well if he was in a collage (and thus, presumably in a magazine), that would not be as much of a fuckup maybe 




 when I read the title I was thinking what kind of hole puncher can go through earphones, but then I realized you meant the cord

 America.  racial profiling is rampant. 




 am I the only one who thinks its weird that the excuse he gave his grandma was that he had girls in there?  I mean, I'm assuming op's a grown man, but normally that's what you try for your grandma not to think. 




 I dont bike so I didnt know what a kickstand for a bike looks like, so I made the mistake of googling it https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=bike+kickstand rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS600US600 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=8MFuVeCRHq6M7AbC7YGICw ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg biw=1366 bih=643 




 it's not your fuck up, it's your mom's.  It's a good thing that everyone found out, really.  They say ignorance is bliss, and it could have been, but for one, your lives would be a lie, two, your dad needed to know the truth, three, even though she did a really bad thing, your mom is also no longer under the pain and strain of keeping that secret.  

In the long run, you did everyone a favor. 

The fact that she broke down like that over a simple genetics conversation means that she was having trouble holding it together in the first place.

Also, better now while you're all still fairly young instead of finding out later in life and possibly destroying the entire family irreperably (as there'd be no obligation to stick together, and also more years of lies).

edit: oh, and also your sister deserves to know her true identity.  Your father raised her and is still her dad to her and hopefully always will be on his end.  But it's a good thing for her to find out who her biological father is if she wants to; at least she has the opportunity. 




 yess! I was thinking the same thing 




 no don't wish more on him 




 so I spent the semester here in the UK, and I was supposed to be going home to the states today, but I woke up 45 minutes after my bus to the airport had left, and there was no way for me to get to the airport in time for my flight.

I overslept because I didn't remember until late last night that I had to print my ticket for said bus to the airport, so I had to go up to the uni to do so, and got back around 2:15am.  I shouldn't have gone to sleep at all.

As a result, I had to have the ticket changed for Friday, and I paid more to change the ticket than I did for the ticket originally.

Pretty costly fuckup. 




 parts of this installment, the prisoner's story, remind me of John Dies At the End.  With the bugs... 




 to an extent: Pumped up Kicks

 




 apparently it will take me about 4 hours to read hitchhiker's, although that, again, may be slowed by scifi terminology and worldbuilding 




 I stand corrected; it is working when you search by ISBN, but not by title, so one must google the title to get the isbn first.  This may be an easier and more important feature to integrate into your code, to google the isbn first and then plug it into amazon. 




 the tool you linked to for measuring reading speed and comprehension was good to know (even if it just wants to sell software in the end).  (I got 242 wpm and 100% accuracy, for the curious).

Anyway, the amazon results are definitely not working on your site, as per your notice.  They are not working at all.  

I hope you get it fixed soon. Although, I realize now that it's really just a calculator which does the searching and calculation in one step.  

Reading speed varies though with each book.  Especially the next novel on my list, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Scifi terminology and names slow reading down a bit, not as much as academic writing, but enough to matter over the course of an entire book.

That being said, your tool can be improved beyond being just a calculator if you measure the reading speed in house (rather than through someone else's link).  

This would be the same sort of division, with a start and stop timer button.  Coding for that should actually be simpler than what you have set up (as you're not pulling info from another site).

But there's no point in re-inventing the wheel, unless you can improve it. 

To make your reading speed calculator better than that on readingsoft, you can have a couple different samples of text, for different genres, which the user would select based on the book they intend to read.  

You can have a generic info one like the one on reading soft, a scifi/fantasy passage, a historical/biographical passage, and an academic passage.  (or a slightly different assortment if you have a better ideas).

These should produce different speeds, which would make for more accurate time estimates depending upon the material.

Another option would be to pull a preview passage from Amazon for the books for which such is available.  Using a passage from the actual book would be really cool, and would be a perfect measurement.   That would be some complex code, but people would really like it.  If you're not making money on it though, that would be too much trouble.  Which is why I suggested a small selection of stock passages instead.

Good luck! 




 I think it's cool that this is happening to so many of you guys.  Just so long as it doesn't start happening *with* people; that could be problematic... 




 continuity error in your brain. 

When we develop mentally, as children, we gain the ability to understand that the world continues without us.  That things will not always be in the last place we left them, that the teacher did not stand in the classroom doorway from when school let out to the next morning coming back in.

Prior to achieving that understanding, however, a child is easily baffled by such continuity errors which occur when things are not as he or she left them.

Nothing to do with intelligence, but rather, perception and theory of mind, perhaps your sleep addled brain experienced such a continuity error, having fallen asleep with your arm like that, and truly believed it still should have been like that.  Especially if, like /u/spreggo suggested, if your arm was asleep, then you didn't get the sensory cues that it was laying flat, so your mind (as it is apt to do) filled in the missing information of your arm's location with the assumption that it should be where it last was.

Basis: my psychology education 




 they probably don't.....
if you subscribe to that theory, we are one of many, so they probably don't all come here... 




 well universes aren't empty.  I don't believe in the swtiching universes thing personally, but the idea is that the person avoided their death by moving into an alternate reality.  The reality isnt populated entirely by people who experienced that.  The realities exist adjacent to eachother.  We were already here, as may have been another version of /u/Stadamus . 




 That's England for you I guess.  I'm not in London, but my first day of class this term, on my way back home from the bus stop, I fell and scraped myself up pretty bad.  I thought I would probably get robbed since my things were all over the floor, but on the contrary.  Someone driving by *pulled over* to see if I was ok and help me up.  That was just so unexpected.  




 when I saw the flairs in the sidebar before I read this, I thought they were added for the poster to mark whether it was a small, medium, large, or xtra large fuck up :) 




 I kind of agree.  If it seems to be loving (although you can't be 100% sure), you don't want to be the one to escalate it to violence (although stalkers usually do so on their own).  The best thing to do with a spirit or entity of any kind is to attempt to be nice to it (and maybe kindly ask it to back down) until it shows other intentions. 




 the title is wrong though, she is missing... 




 hmm, then I would say you're just more sensitive to it or actively aware of sensing it.  The someone behind you thing, and things like the facebook thing, are subtle things that just subconsciously register.  The difference then is that you're consciously noticing the signals.  

Just my inference 




 the first one to actually keep me up was room 733, because I read it at 2am in my dorm room.  I stayed up until 5 that night 




 The hearing things fall but nothing being on the floor or anything happens with some regularity at my house as well.  Also usually in the kitchen, when no one is in there.   




 the fact that its usually mischevious stuff, and happened as well in your own home as a child, makes it sound like its not a doppleganger so much as a spirit playing practical jokes. I wouldn't be concered about it being sinister, since its been happening for so long with no danger. But the part for a machine is a bit concerning. As well as the computer doing things in your name that it should not be able to. If it escalates into more dangerous territory (edited medical records, someone seeing you tinkering with the engine on a forklift, etc) then it may be time to get some kind of help (and I don't mean mental help). Although, you might have blackouts, as a more "rational" explanation. Can you account for your entire day on your floor? Are you sure? 




 the "coffin" is definitely the head of the figure, drawn out from the motion of the shot.  As for the figures themselves, \_()_/ 




 of course; trying too hard with anything of this nature ultimately sets you up for failure or self-delusion.
