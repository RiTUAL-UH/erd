 He's just walking it off. I'm sure the mouse will be ok. 




 Great title, OP. 




 The snake gets HIV. 




 I come here to not see hashtags, so please stop using them. 




 It's called vomiting, and I do it all the time at bars as a defence mechanism against attractive women. 









 Now that I filed for bankruptcy, Im not as cool as I was last week.  
  
Am I wrong if I think he's a shitty person because he thinks this way? 




 That's not where you store the chili. 




 If you ever get really high and forget which planet you're on, just look at your knife and you'll know. 




 Dank life, bro.

 You can, but it's wrong. 




 This is like saying Fallout is a really new game because it takes place in the future. 









 Jet fuel. 




 Be kind, sir, for you are commenting on the most gentlemanly of all sub(le)reddits. If you are unhappy with the may-may /u/IAmBecomeGay has posted, then I suggest you show your disapproval using the downboater button to the left.  
  
Good day.

Flawless until she stopped relying on her thesaurus. 




 Hmmm... how did I miss that one? But does it actually violate rule 4 since it's not a flyer from a special interest group and not a political party? 




 What rule does it violate? 




 As dank as this post was, it belongs to the interwebz now. Be a gentlesir and let le may-may go. 









 Implying that pro-lifers have integrity. 




 Maybe it crawled on top of the skid plate and that's where the guy found it. It would have to be removed in order for him to be able to change the oil, so that would make sense. 




 Why do you subscribe to that garbage? 




 To make matters worse, it wasn't even a good hockey team. 




 Half the fun of masturbation is the chance of being caught. 




 Also known as George Costanza's Revenge. 




 Can we get a gif of this?

 More gooey goodness than a cheddar smokey! 




 They only want men for one thing: their GBPs.

 A bar that allows smoking? Where do you live? 




 Further to question 1: What kind of work were you doing and what kind of smoke was it? 









 Looks like a vegetarian burger. 
























 I have a few questions:  
  
1. Where were you exposed to second hand smoke and how long were you exposed for?  
  
2. How old are you?  
  
3. Besides working on getting better, how do you plan on spending the next six months? 




 It got what was coming to it. Fuck wasps. 




 Gary? 




 Doesn't matter, I'd bang them all. 




 Anyone who has grown up around chickens can tell you that this is probably the only cool thing they can do before they become food. 




 After all the braless shots I've seen on this sub, I'm thinking that maybe it should be renamed /r/oldschoolnipples. 




 Clone High! Do Abe and Joan fall in love and live happily ever after? Who fucking knows, because they cancelled it after only one season.

 Nice hooter. 




 What kind of problems or unique traits does Zeke have because of his extra chromosome? 




 kindest thing i have ever heard  
  
Have you spent your entire life having insults shouted at you by the ghost of Hitler? It certainly was kind, but the kind*est* thing you have ever heard? C'mon. 




 I can't believe grandma found another "crucifix" at Toys 'R' Us! When will she learn? 




 They delivered.  
  
Dank pun. 




 Lol  
  
The fucking thing could have given you rabies. 




 Those crazy Torontonians, amirite? 




 How can quotes be real if our eyes aren't real?

 I paid $10. Come at me, bro. 




 Working. 














 I tried this when I was 14 or 15. I was much more flexible than I am now, so I was able to autofallate myself with some success a handful of times before I realized how weird it was and quit. The only dick I've sucked is my own, so I can't say with certainty if it feels like sucking someone else's D. I can, however, say without a doubt that it does *not* feel like being sucked by someone else. What it does feel like, however, is shame. *100% pure shame.* 




 Thanks for the shout out! 




 Why did you draw an eraser at the end of the pencil? Wouldn't it make more sense to erase the "r" instead of scribbling it out? 




 Don't forget Hitler! Might as well make reference to him too if you're going to try to explain how pinata making is comparable to large-scale war crimes.  




 You've been a redditor for three months and this is your first comment? Have you been waiting all this time for the perfect moment to make a homophobic comment? 




 I shall cherish this always. 




 'Cause it feels good, bro. 




 These people trying to make a case for coal by saying that the wind never blows again once it stops and the sun never rises again once it sets, and you want me to not judge them for their stupidity? 




 What an explosive punchline. 




 I had no idea it was even legal there in the first place. It certainly explains why all those creepy weeaboos want to move there. 




 The shape of his hair makes me cringe at the thought of taking it out of my rectum. 




 I'm bullet-free, but it would be a completely different story if you had posted this a week ago. 




 What a shitty... oh, wait, /u/GallowBoob posted it? To the front page with you! 




 So, it's a nice way to call someone a bastard? 




 It's gold, dammit. 




 You have a very low standard for geography knowledge. 




 Greenland is close enough. 




 Besides, the last thing this country needs is more furries. 




 How many burritos did you have to eat in order to fill the house with toxic gas? 




 You don't need a neckbeard to be a neckbeard. 









 Is it a whale with a golf ball stuck in its blowhole? 









 Adults need ice cream too.

 Don't worry, I'm sure someone will find a way to monetize karma and then you'll be moderately wealthy. Chicks don't completely abhor moderately wealthy reddit moderators. 




 Check out his wikipedia article and see if you can find the latest edit. [Here's a screen cap](http://i.imgur.com/3ZkcK9M.png), because I'm sure it won't last long. 




 Check out Iwata's wikipedia article right now and look at what it says where his name should be over his picture. [Here's a screencap](http://i.imgur.com/3ZkcK9M.png), because I'm sure it won't last long. 









 It really is just a hut. Who would have thunk? 









 They sure do. 




 /r/fatpeoplehate had risen from the ashes! You cannot silence us! 




 Why don't you sing a song about it? 









 Tomorrow's top post on /r/all will be this guy's album of Optimus Prime photos taken in downtown Chicago. 




 That man with a dog's head is hugging that dog with what I can only assume is a human's head. 




 The people who post to this sub are the best kind of people. They're actually providing a service to the reddit community without getting much recognition for it. 




 How can one vagina take up so much space? 




 Jesus Christ, those ears.

 Smurf Rescue for Coleco Vision. Apparently, there is a code you can enter to make Smurfette's clothes come off at the end. What I would have given to know that code as a 5 year old. 




 Can I borrow one? 




 So anyway why did you go on to give detailed statements to thirdparty dank memers first, before speaking to us? The place with the tagline 'Hitler did nothing wrong'? The people you slighted in the first place? Hell even 4chins got info before this statement from m'lady...  
  
Edit: /u/kickme444 responded to me, but I anticipate m'lady will be heavily euphoric so here's the reply  
It was hard to communicate my dank memes, because my comments were being downboated. I did comment on (le)reddit lmayyyyo and was tipping my trilby on a private subreddit. I'm euphoric now." 




 things nobody should have to see  
  
Do you mean things like your post? 




 And judging from how many decorations he had, I'd say he did quite well at being a Nazi. 




 Did she make the fat suit herself? Please tell me that's a fat suit. 




 Who are you to judge a dog as unhealthy or "poor taste" just because it has a slight defect? What are you, a vet? Perhaps you're some fancy pants dog judger? You know, some dogs are just ugly, even without "defects." And what about all the pictures of dogs with underbites that have been posted? Isn't that a birth defect?
  
**Your sub is bad and you should feel bad.** 




 This sub is turning into /r/goreporn. 




 They were there to throw stones at the performers. 




 M'barbecue lighter for le grill. 




 I have a pair of Cons with a very similar pattern. I've become what I hate. 




 I was just linked here by a /r/justneckbeardthings post. How meta is that? 




 So both. 




 Canada Day. It's the exact same as 4th of July, except Canadian and three days earlier. 




 This kills the frog. 




 RIP OP. 




 Give them a break, they're idiots. 




 Thank you for the thumbnail, OP. 









 What the fuck was that supposed to be? Who is that lady? 




 Fun fact: the ship is numbered 330. In real life, the HMCS Halifax has that same number.
