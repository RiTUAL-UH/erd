 Just got back from a special screening that AMC did where they sent me two free tickets. First I will say that right before the movie began, I checked the ratings and saw it was at 54% on RT. Disappointing so my hopes were not high.

But that movie was amazing. The raw emotion that Jake showed was extremely intense the entire film. This was not a movie about boxing, it was a movie about an emotional journey of a man.

As the trailer spoils, Rachel McAdams dies. This happens pretty early in the film and the rest is a semi-poorly written script on his downward spiral and redemption. While I was not a fan of the writing, Rachel and Jake both shined bright.

If you've been watching the new True Detective season, you've seen a side of Rachel McAdams that she hasn't shown before. This is another. Rachel's character is an extremely realistic, semi-trashy girl who plays the part perfectly. When she shrugs when Jake looks at her in between rounds in the first match, it portrays a girl who grew up with Jake's character and does not love, but lives with his career out of necessity. She never celebrates the huge money but clearly enjoys it, nearly to a fault. The way she played the character was perfect for the background they gave.

As for Jake, it was a brilliant performance. The way he acted in Rachel's death scene was perfect. While the death itself was not particularly realistic, Rachel's reaction and the way Jake held her and talked to her was more realistic than I've ever seen in any movie. It showed the pure fear he had for losing someone he'd grown up with. It showed how much he depended on her. It made me shed a few tears.

Jake's character was played as a hyper-emotional, dumb kid, who grew up in the foster system. He nailed it at every turn. Meeting his new boxing trainer, perfect. Frustration with his comeback, perfect. Dealing with his daughter in uncharted territory, perfect. He truly got into this character's head and the dedication to his work was evident. He lived and breathed this character every second of the film.

This was a character that Jake had never played before. While I thought his worst performance was Source Code, where he didn't show much at all, he added another masterful performance to his collection here. Between Nightcrawler, Enemy, Prisoners, End of Watch, Zodiac, Jarhead, Brokeback Mountain, Bubble Boy, Donnie Darko, October Sky, and now Southpaw, Jake Gyllenhaal is truly one of the most versatile actors of our generation. It is truly a pleasure to see him perform- especially when we have actors who play basically the same character at every turn (Michael Cera, Liam Neeson, Kevin Hart, Melissa McCarthy, etc.).

My biggest gripe in the movie was probably that he literally was a southpaw fighter for one second of the entire film, and the lone reference to being a southpaw was of no significance whatsoever. But if you're not a big fight fan, you likely wouldn't notice that anyway.

If I could rate a movie just on the raw performance of the lead actor, I'd give it a 10/10. Unfortunately the writing was weak and some of the secondary characters were weak/underdeveloped (the random extra death, 50 Cent's performance and Forest Whitaker to an extent), so I'll give the movie an overall 6.5/10. 




 Like what? We can torture them if they commit a crime? 




 What about it? The article you responded with does not provide a national total. 




 The article you are referencing uses another article as its source. In that source article, it demonstrates this 40+ point lead in only Nevada and Colorado, specifically noting that Hillary's lead is not as big in either North Carolina or Florida. 




 This poll is for Nevada only, where Hispanics/Latinos make up 27% of the population. Source: http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/32000.html

Aka, this is near meaningless, unless you can think of some reason you should extrapolate the results nationwide. 




 Why in the world did you answer the door when the cop knocked? 




 I always hear tons of anecdotal evidence but I'll wait for a poll from your state before judging. 




 Please reconcile the differences. 




 So you're ok with killing those with low IQ, those in prison, and unwanted kids in general? 




 You should read up on the term "anchor babies." 




 To put it in perspective:

The closest states, by percentage vote, between Democrat and Republican, in the 2012 election:

North Carolina- R

Florida- D

Ohio- D

Virginia- D

These are the true "toss-up" states. Every other state was more than 5 percentage points apart.

To put this in perspective, the Democrat for 2016 can lose every single one of those states and still achieve the 270 votes necessary. So basically, Virginia is decently important, only if the Republicans make some headway on the more solidly Democratic states, including Colorado, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, or Iowa (and it just gets more unrealistic from there).
 




 Wait, so you're saying you're ok with killing unwanted people? 




 They can be punished appropriately now. There is nothing about how recent a decision came down that says that it need not be followed. As soon as it can be reasonably interpreted by the county, it needs to be followed. This, historically, means less than a week, which we are long past. 




 You have to look at not just the lawfulness of the situation but the reality of the situation.

The reality is, any clerk who denies marriage certificates to gay couples is likely in an area where they are surrounded by like minded people. This person will not get fired immediately because who will the person denied complain to? The clerk's boss, who may say too bad? The person denied will have to hire a lawyer and file an action against the county.

Contrast this with the reality of your Muslim clerk. What are you picturing? A Muslim who is surrounded by non-Muslims? In such a case, the woman would complain to the clerk's boss and the person would be quickly fired. However, if surrounded by like-minded Muslims, the exact same thing as the first scenario would play out.

Your premise is picturing two different situations. The bottom line is, if clerks are surrounded by like-minded people, it will likely take attorney action. If not surrounded by like-minded people, the boss will quickly correct the action. It really has nothing to do with being against gay marriage/Muslims, other than the fact that one is more prevalent in our country. 




 Just FYI, you guys are planning on committing a couple felonies including false imprisonment and possibly another by refusing him to seek help (impeding his ability to call 911, which he may try to do if he feels threatened).

 Medi-Cal is usually retroactive for a certain period, I believe 3 months. 




 You know I was going to say Executive Order, but the more I think I about it, the more that it's almost an entirely private issue.

Sure, the President could order that all government entities convert to metric, but private companies would still provide both conversions due to demand. I reckon it would take multiple decades for the private companies to switch over after the government. 




 There was an article the other day posted on /r/TrueReddit where there were 2 sets of identical twins accidentally switched at birth in a South American country. One family was middle class in the city and the other was rural poor. Very interesting article. 




 You would like Naked and Afraid.

It's usually a 2 person team and they each get to bring an item (usually choose firestarter and machete), and they have to survive for 21 days completely on their own.

They recently started a show of the best survivors, called Naked and Afraid XL, where it's for 40 days and consists of 4 teams of 3 each, and by the previews it looks like the groups find each other in later episodes. 




 Weeds was the only one. I loved that show and how they mixed up the opening song. 




 The question is: of the support she does receive, who gives more than 50%?

If she truly receives no support then give her a dollar and she can legally use your and her wife's tax returns instead. 




 The closest analogy I could make is PPV where the providers typical take a 50% cut. Not exactly the answer you were looking for, but just to give you an idea. 




 It's worth noting that the test is which parent provides more than 50% support to the child, not who the child lives with more than 50% of the time. Small, but notable difference. 




 That is fraud. It's a low likelihood but possible that the school could ask for verification. 




 Same! I've had this on my list for awhile and was very disappointed to see no theater release or any promotion whatsoever. 




 You can't. I was in this situation where my parents kicked me out of the house midway through my senior year in high school, and when I applied for financial aid, I couldn't because my parents would not let me see their tax return.

I applied for an independent override at my school but was denied because I didn't meet their very strict requirements- including physical abuse by a parent with corroborating police reports. In short, it's not gonna happen in your situation, given what you've described.

What I did was wait until the year I turned 23, when you get automatic independent status.

What your kid can do is community college in the meantime that does not require loans. 




 I'm unsure why guillotine is never mentioned. Assuming it's properly sharpened, that's about as quick and painless as you can get. 




 First, yes there is spyware for iPhones. Second, nobody needs confirmation to know you look at porn. By virtue of you being a teenage male with Internet access, I know you look at porn. 




 Is your username because God created Man? 




 Completely agree that one innocent death is too many.

I believe it should only be used in specific cases of absolute certainty. 




 High quality video, hundreds of witnesses, and DNA evidence. Think Columbine. How is certainty of guilt invalid? 




 Fully expected Omar 




 Oh wow I'm not in /r/mma 




 I hate the radio commercials I hear 5 times a day about how we need to scream louder, cheer harder, blah blah blah.

It's like a girlfriend threatening to leave unless you buy her stuff and your friend going "oh dude you better do everything you can to get her to stay." Screw that, if you're gonna threaten to leave unless I do something then I'd rather be single. What poor ownership of the team. 




 Was the dog found in the University Heights area? 




 I'll let an actual lawyer specializing in landlord-tenant law answer but to me, as a law student working in an office that deals with mostly property law, all charges look legitimate to me.

Definitely request an itemized invoice and copies of receipts for work performed, but I doubt the fact that he was maybe a day late or didn't provide those before you requested them would give you the right to not be responsible for any portion of the damages. 




 Besides Barao, at HW, Noguiera unsuccessfully defended his interim belt against Mir when he could have fought the actual title holder (Couture), who lost to Brock, who fought Mir at UFC 100 to unify the titles. 









 Yea I'm not sure how that would play into it. I just remember that I had a friend who lost one parent and his surviving parent received a good chunk of change until he was 18. Let alone 3 kids with both parents dying. 




 It's not after the victim speaks up, it's after they turn 18. So if the statute of limitations is 7 years and the abuse ends when the kid is 12 then he/she has 15 years to have charges filed by the DA. 




 Have you looked into getting social security benefits for the kids since their parents died?

Children are usually entitled to such benefits until 18. 




 Other people gave you advice on the bill, but for the insurance I can tell you if you need to go on Medicaid or the exchange if you tell me your annual income. 




 Maybe he is just never around mirrors. Maybe he's a vampire and doesn't want to be known. Someone put a mirror in front of him next time they meet him. 




 Was BJ at the airport too?


I'm kidding, that's actually pretty cool. What did he say about the fight? 




 So let's say you, as a gay man, is on a road trip. You try to buy gas at the town you stop in because you're near empty. The gas station, and every other, refuses to serve you.

Ok so you call up a tow truck to get your car towed to the next town. That person, and every other tow truck service in town refuse to serve you.

So you're getting hungry, but every single restaurant/grocery store refuses to serve you.

Well you'll just go sleep somewhere and figure it out tomorrow. But the only hotel in town refuses to serve you.

This is a world you want to live in? 




 HIPAA 




 Whooooo! Bought time. 




 Yea, I keep refreshing thinking I'm missing it, but it still says standby. 




 I mean I totally see where you're coming from. I thought both were extremely close. 




 Look at the strike differential for Rory in the 1st. Also, the 4th was Rory's pretty solidly in the beginning and Lawler didn't hit back as hard in the later parts of the round.

I'm not saying it was clear cut, but I think both Rory edges both rounds. 




 I'm sorry, I forgot the rules since I never post threads. I just deleted it but it's still showing. 




 Ah I see. Those threads get too hard to read for me unless you sort by New, but then it screws up the rest of reddit until you change it back. 




 So do they put Conor/Aldo on 190 in 3 weeks or 191 in 8 weeks?

I think they could make 190, but barely. On the other hand, do Aldo and Conor really want to go through all that press again for 8 more weeks? I guess Dana will tell us in the post fight press conference. 




 Who the hell thinks that was early? Chad was done, and that coming from someone who hates Conor. 




 Conor's cardio is unreal. Like how did he take that wrestling for 2 rounds, with punches peppered in there, then stand up with cardio looking like he just started the fight? Especially with that weight cut.

It was the cardio that won Conor the fight, hands down. All bets are off for favoring Aldo now, and I'm a Conor hater and huge fan of Aldo. 




 IM BETTING GOLD FOR A YEAR. I GOT MENDES. PUT UP OR SHUT UP MCGREGOR FANS.

Edit: I admit. I was wrong. Glad nobody was confident enough to bet it. 









 Do you have any proof of this deal? Emails? Texts? Witnesses? 




 Do you have a contract? 




 I'm not sure if they do at Hooters, but they definitely show the prelims at Buffalo Wild Wings. 




 I actually caught a card there and met some pretty cool guys so good suggestion. 




 I moved here about a year ago and have been super busy with school so I haven't made many friends, let alone ones who watch MMA.

I usually drag my girlfriend to watch the big cards at Buffalo Wild Wings, but she has a big test coming up and won't go and I don't want to sit at home by myself and watch a card this big.

So anyone nearby?!

Bonus points if you realize Mendes is gonna wrestlefuck McGregor so I don't have to argue with you the whole time. 




 Girls. 




 I mean almost every champ is top 10 p4p... 




 No, I don't want to try to remember a bet for over a year. Propose this to me next year in October and I'll take it. 




 You can't just use your grandparents for no reason. If OP's cousin lives with her parents then her parents must file taxes for The cousin to use FAFSA. 




 50% 




 Not OP, but I think Hillary takes the exact same electoral votes and a more dominant percentage, around 54%.

The main difference will show in Florida where Hillary will win more seniors than Obama did. 




 I see a bunch of answers that do not QUITE answer what I perceive your question, OP.

So here's what would happen, despite how unlikely. First, as others have said the amendment cannot be unconstitutional by definition if it passes. But let's say it passed and SCOTUS said it WAS unconstitutional. Well then according to them, the amendment is invalid. However, it seems likely that the Executive branch would be unlikely to enforce such a decision because of the overwhelming support.

It really comes down to the fact that each govt entity only has as much power as its people bestow upon it. 




 More like:

You: "Hey what's your name again?"

Him: "You don't know my name?"

You: "No, uh, I meant your last name."

Him: "Oh. It's Smith."

You: "Ok, uh, bro, Mr. Smith..." 




 Obviously I was referring to the fact that they do not enforce by not arresting along their set guidelines while reserving the right to arrest and prosecute where they please.

Now if you will answer my question instead of going around it, WHAT IF the federal govt refuses to enforce any law? 




 The rule I've heard from advisors is that LSAT counts for 50% of your app, GPA is 49% and everything else, including school difficulty, work experience and extracurriculars are 1%. 




 Ok but your argument has one problem. The executive branch HAS stopped enforcing federal law on marijuana. How have they achieved that in your view?

Now, since the executive branch is tasked with enforcing the legislative branch and judicial branch's laws, what do you suppose happens if they refuse, as they are doing on the subject of marijuana? 




 Nothing. The President could order any part of the govt to stop enforcing any law. As a society, we give legitimacy to the govt by accepting its role. If we recognize the role of the executive branch as enforcers with the power to stop enforcing laws as they see fit, then that is a legitimate political end. 




 Just visit the Army/Navy/Airforce/Marines/Coast Guard website and I'm sure there will be a button for a recruiter to contact you. 




 I never said they created the law. My contention is that their decisions are interpretations of the law and that majority opinions are the supreme law of the land. 




 Ultimate lawyer answer. I love it. 




 You'd have to ask the founders of our country. My guess would be judicial economy. 




 I reject your premise. My contention is that SCOTUS is allowed to do anything, yes, even an infringement on the rights of others.

SCOTUS decisions ARE the law and therefore everything they write in majority opinions are their lawful interpretation of the Constitution. So you cannot say they can make any decision that is unlawful. Again, I cite to Marbury v. Madison for this contention. 




 Not according to my argument. If you tell me why it's flawed, I'll respond accordingly. 




 Lol. I'm aware how the decisions are made. I was merely saying that they could have been made on any day of the past weeks or next week and it was definitely on purpose that Kennedy released his third opinion on the matter on the anniversary. 









 YES! If a majority opinion of the Supreme Court says something is so, then legally it is the supreme law of the land. That's how our country works! See Marbury v. Madison for context of this phenomenon.

Also I'm fine removing the word "implied" because it does not LIMIT the text of the 10th Amendment, whereas your adding of the word explicitly does limit the text. I'll cite to the Necessary and Proper Clause to show that our Constitution grants implied powers. 




 So you would be denying someone the right to marry based on their gender? Eve can marry Adam, but Steve cannot marry Adam, and thus Steve would be denied the same rights as Eve, based on his gender. Thus, since gender discrimination should not be allowed, same sex marriage should be allowed. 




 What about before the Loving decision? The previous 100 years or so had said that interracial couples did not have the right to marriage. So you can see why basing your argument merely on the fact that most of our history was against it is flawed. Unless you are also contending that interracial marriage should be not allowed? 




 I believe the language was appropriate in light of the decision bring a landmark in American history. It wasn't the first to use cute language and certainly won't be the last.

And to be honest, that type of language does not matter at all. When we study cases in class, they only leave the relevant parts and cut out 90% of the text that reiterates or is useless in changing the previous status quo. Only a very small portion of future lawyers and legislators in America will even read the flowery portions of the opinion. Not to mention how salty his dissent was. Why is he allowed to use unprofessional language and not the majority? 




 You are factually incorrect. To quote the text of the 10th Amendment: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

It says nothing about the powers not EXPLICITLY granted to the federal govt being reserved for the states. Therefore, any implied powers are also reserved for the federal govt. Since the power to regulate marriage on the basis of sex has been implied by the majority opinion today, it is therefore deemed to have been one of the powers of the federal govt since the 14th Amendment passed, on which the decision is based. 




 I've read the opinion and it only mentions that states are required to grant marriages and recognize them. It explicitly leaves out territories, and unlike the recent healthcare decision, it seems that there is no intent to include anything beyond the text.

However, I am only a law student and unfamiliar if SCOTUS decisions normally apply to the states and territories. 




 It is implied, as are numerous other rights. The Right to Privacy is also not explicitly stated in the Constitution. Would you argue that citizens do not have the Right to Privacy? 




 I agree and would contend that this is a fundamental right that has been wrongfully denied to same sex couples from the passage of the 14th to 2003. 




 For the record I'm in law school now and actually right in the middle of taking my Constitutional Law course this Summer.

I think it's very fair to summarize as 14th v. 10th. The hard part about the justices wrapping their heads around saying that gay marriage is legal is that they are not granting new rights but merely interpreting the Constitution as saying that these rights were granted when the 14th Amendment was passed and are merely being recognized now.

I just finished reading the majority and the dissents and in one of the dissents, I think it was Scalia's, the author says that by interpreting the 14th Amendment as granting the rights of gay marriage, the majority is contending that they see something that every past SCOTUS justice has missed in the past and how insulting it is to those past great justices. The author then goes on to list these great justices and how by finding that this right exists, every state from the passage of the 14th to 2003, a total of 135 years has been missing this right.

This is a somewhat disingenuous argument as justices can only judge the cases in front of them, and I am not aware of any cases regarding the rights of same sex couples to marry until very recently. And so, these justices have not missed this interpretation as it was never presented to them. The states however, have missed this interpretation. At that comes in the 10th Amendment. Since it is generally understood that states regulate marriage, it seemed natural that they would determine who could participate in such institution. However, they did not anticipate that this interpretation would be an infringement of civil rights.

Therefore, I believe you are correct in saying that because the states believe they have the rights to regulate marriage from the 10th Amendment, but SCOTUS has stepped in and said that when there is an infringement of civil rights, the 14th rules. And by the fact the federal law overrules state law, it is lawful for SCOTUS to interpret the Constitution to bestow these rights of marriage upon all citizens. 




 I definitely think this was done on purpose. It could have been issued yesterday or Monday with other opinions. 




 I read an article talking about how this still happens in the US, usually exactly how you described it- rich families in rural areas having foreigners be literal slaves.

 Maybe look up the closest campground. They're usually cheap and all you need is a tent. 




 I don't really agree with that since he was one minute away from winning 2/3 hardest fights (Anderson 1 and Jones) and he dominated the first round of the other one (Anderson 2). 




 I'm actually buying this. 




 A third place win? 




 Foakes v. Beer!!!! Law school has finally paid off! 




 You're convincing the wrong person. The average person will see over and over that Bernie is a self-described socialist and that will be it. 




 I see this all the time on reddit, but I truly do not believe he is electable in the general. I have not seen any polls of Sanders vs Republican candidates so I base this instead on statistical evidence showing that 50% of Americans refuse to elect a Socialist (http://www.gallup.com/poll/183713/socialist-presidential-candidates-least-appealing.aspx).

Now I love Sanders' viewpoints and think he'd make a great president. But he openly says he is a socialist, and looking at the evidence shows America is not ready for a socialist president.

Therefore, I say that if I voted for Sanders in the primary, and others do as well, he may win, and therefore likely lose the general election. Thus, I will vote for Clinton because that is the avenue most likely to not have a Republican president. I look at the lesser of evils. While I am not so fond of Clinton, I view a potential Republican president as far worse. 




 Fair enough. 




 To be honest, I only read about it in here. I have no idea if it exists either. I was basing my statements on the assumption that it does exist. 




 Whatever. I vote for whichever candidate I feel will do the least harm. 




 At least 30-40%. There are many many people who have no idea that he even exists. 




 I based my statement purely on statistical evidence from polls indicating that those who know both Clinton and Sanders favor Sanders. While it is possible this will not extrapolate to the population as a whole, I believe Sanders' positions are more favorable to the average American and thus that if he had the same recognition as Clinton he would win.
