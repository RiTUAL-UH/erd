 The Birds, I hear it was terrifying when it first came out but it's hilarious to watch now.

The movie is on the above link, the character I think is David Cross comes in at about 42:15. IMDB and Wikipedia have no mention of the character on either Cross' page or the movie's. 

It makes sense for it to be him; 1994 is when he was just beginning his career and they casted the cheapest actors they could. Also, he seems like the kind of guy who would enjoy making fun of his own mistakes, as they did in season 4 of Arrested Development. Thoughts? Can anyone find proof of who this actor is?

 Holy shit 




 I've been on Accutane for a month now and I'm just starting to see some improvements. Make sure you have some petroleum jelly when you begin, my lips got super dry and that was the only thing that helped
