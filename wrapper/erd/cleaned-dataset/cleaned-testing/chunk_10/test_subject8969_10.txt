 I hope you don't either man. I just have run out of ideas. I wish I could find some magical cure that can make me happy but I don't think there is one. And unfortunately, it doesn't give me much hope. 




 I know exactly what you mean. An accident that resulted in my death sounds terrific. I want to fade away into nothingness 




 I just want to be able to laugh, you know? I want to be able to play video games and go outside and have sex and be happy while doing those things. I want to be able to find things enjoyable, and when I dont, I don't get the point of living. I would give anything for the meds and therapy to work and make me better. I would sell everything I have and become a monk if that somehow got rid of my depression. I would do anything 




 Hey! Would love to join. IGN: Anon_Agon 




 I didn't compile the list myself, and it's quite possible some items might be wrong. 




 True! I didn't make this list, I just posted it on pastebin. Good catch. I can't edit it because I posted it as guest on pastebin.
