 People make the argument that it is okay that the information was leaked because swingers/poly peoples' SOs already know the information, so it is okay. I'm sorry I misunderstood your post. I'm not upset, nor was I was trying to "shit on" your post; quite the opposite. I was trying to have a conversation around the issue because I don't understand why Reddit (I'm basing that on the number or front page posts celebrating this hack) is so happy about this hack.
