 And this happened  100 years ago.  




 Well my folks lived in Chicago and woolworths lunch counter was whites only. In Chicago.  




 Haven't seen but listened to the audio and she does not want to exit her car. The cop forced her to do so. The whole thing reeks.  




 Apparently.  




 This. If you don't have the nose to immediately remove your kid, you're selfish. I'm a parent of a young child and have only had to threaten to leave a place once, did not have to follow throu because he got his shit together. My nephew is the opposite and throws tantrums like they're knives. He's been removed and even I think his folks wait too long. It's fucking rude.  




 Oh horseshit.  









 That's just a rumer.  



















 Yikes. I walked in on my folks once, but never them on me.  




 It was the boogers, wasn't it.  














 She's right. All her detractors and folks calling her naiive - seriously, check yourself. Talk about privilege. Whew. She's doing what she can to better the world after being gunned down by a backward fundie for attempting to be educated!  




 I heard one commentator say, these are often illiterate and poor fundies with brand new automatic weapons. Stop the flow of weapons, get the guns away from them, and it will be a start. They have so much money and weaponry, that's what is allowing them to flourish. Or rather spread like a virus.  




 Doublespeak or brain damage, or a combo. It's like GW Bush's Clean Air act, or the GOP's family values platform. Actually, the GOP and ISIS are two peas in a pod; the GOP has the global arms trader the NRA as a sponsor. Buddies forever.  




 Blah blah blah NRA blah blah blah  




 It's the NRA astroturfers. In reality, the majority of America is tired of the gun terrorism and the blood spilled every day. Not sure how much of it is covered in international press. It's abhorrent. Six toddlers this week were killed in America by guns. 
From Women Against Gun Violence's facebook page:
6th TODDLER SHOT THIS WEEK: A 3-year-old boy is in critical condition after shooting himself in the head with his grandfather's gun. The loaded gun had been left on the nightstand next to the bed where the toddler was napping. This is the sixth child, 4 and under, to be shot this week. http://ow.ly/PeMUA 




 American here, and I'm happily surprised at the lack of Ted nugent all over the place in here.  




 They've been civil for ages.

 Detectives said it appeared the loaded pistol had been left on the nightstand next to the bed. If true, detectives said the grandparents could face a misdemeanor charge of making a firearm accessible to a child.

The charge can result in a fine and up to a year in jail. 














 Stout sista here too 
























 This incident is not the first time that news crews have been targeted in the Bay Area.  Stations have resorted to hiring security guards to accompany crews to certain stories, particularly those in Oakland. 









 Par for the course with the "new reddit", eh? Frustrated. As a long-time user I don't know if I just subscribe to the wrong subs or what, but it seems to have become a bastion of shills for corporate, fracking and guns.  Misogyny and racism abound.  









 I'm donating to Bernie monthly. I am furious but unsurprised at the media stonewalling him. All the more reason. Vote him in.  




 Six year olds also need to follow rules!!! 



















 Yeah, the air conditioned WASP nests.  




 I worked at a large print shop for years. They eliminated the QC department and later sold to an investment group. They repeatedly cut the workers and added on more and more executives. I imagine nowadays it's all upper management and nobody there to actually do the fucking jobs.  




 Ugh! The pain :( 




 Oh he knew. :) 




 He picked the WRONG tea party to attend!  




 No bueno, eh Trumpsta?  









 The poor state with no access to healthcare, infant mortality rates akin to Somalia, and so many deaths by gun each day that they make counting and studying the violence illegal!  




 Exactly. This is why there is a huge pushback against the open carry terrorists. Nobody wants to be gunned down while living our lives. 




 Lol! That's hilarious. Not worrying about people walking around with death machines, when we lose so many globally per day to such dangerous weaponry. Absolutely idiotic stance you've got there.  




 It's just Rick Perry on the lookout for coyotes. Furry or human.  




 Yep. It's what the Open Carry buffoons are aiming for, so to speak.  




 Yemen, and Texas. Hard to tell sometimes.  









 Holy shit. I had no idea Boulder was so bad on vaccination. That is horrible.  




 As a woman, I cannot support such an anti-woman candidate as Rand Paul. Not only are his isolationist ideas detrimental to our country, as proven over and over when social structures are slashed (See: Colorado Springs / streetlights), but his views on Choice are repugnant. Abysmal. Abhorrent.

 Fuck you Carly!  




 Which six are white?! I see four white dudes.  




 Just misogynist?  
























 Aren't all their names fucked up? Stick? Trigger? Flashlight?  




 If you don't want any lectures, go home and stop giving press releases about your uterus. I still rue the day McCain unleashed White Trash university all over the nation.  




 More like Bad Cop/Donut Hole.  




 George C. Deutsch
Deutsch, who worked on Bush's reelection campaign, was appointed to NASA's press office. A creationist, Deutsch attempted to have the word "theory" added to every instance of the phrase "Big Bang" on NASA's website. He also allegedly kept the press from talking to Dr. James Hansen, an expert on global warming. He was released from his position in 2006 after blogger Nick Anthis discovered that Deutsch had lied on his rsum and had never actually graduated college. He later claimed that the only reason his appointment was controversial was because he was a Christian.


Oh fuck. I'm going to throw up. 
 




 ***BAGUETTE! maintenant!*** 




 This is how I feel with 40K in student loans in an era where information is freely available and I have to learn it all to keep up anyway.  




 This is making me nostalgic for the homeland with it's small government ban on fracking bans.  




 Fuck! The other story I read today about Parisian Taxi drivers involved one pretending to be an uber customer, directing the uber driver somewhere secluded and assaulting the driver. What the fucking fuck! Paris should abolish taxis if this is how they are; sound like a bunch of thugnuts.  




 Dat code.  




 I have a friend who made sure each of her kids names include B R E T for Bret Michaels. I never had the heart to tell her about the time I got backstage w/ a friend, and he had this 14 year old girl back there with him. Yikes. Skeeziest band ever.

Investigators are asking for the public's help in locating a 1970s full-size, single-cab Chevrolet or GMC pickup truck that is a faded single-orange color with black primer on the driver's side body. The pickup also has a full-size bed and round headlights.

Residents should pay special attention to the rendering's distinctive headlights, Larimer County Sheriff's Office spokesman David Moore said in a media briefing. 
























 Dude what is this about?!

 Cocaine is a helluva drug  




 Cocaine is a helluva drug  









 Bravo to you! Been so long since that's happened, I can't even say. Actually I can - it has been since 2010. When my ex left me alone with my kiddo not long after he was born I became 100% mom. Have him always, so no time to ever meet a partner. I'm both envious and happy for you.  



















 In a post on an online forum for Texas supporters of the concealed carry of handguns, Cotton wrote, "he [Rev. Pinckney] voted against concealed-carry. Eight of his church members who might be alive if he had expressly allowed members to carry handguns in church are dead. Innocent people died because of his position on a political issue." 














 Dad gifted him a gun after he'd recently been arrested. Hoping to see charges against the father for that. I had a similar thought - could picture this full-on KKK picnic in the back country celebrating this shit. Seriously, I watched this PBS special [Klansville USA](http://video.pbs.org/video/2365401775/) recently that had the most appalling footage. I know the history, but seeing it is another level of nauseating. 
 




 I thought inbred. Not sure why, because I don't really know what inbred people would look like, but I'm guessing basically exactly like the POS.  




 Not just humans. My dog Freaks on drunk people. I've always assumed she is sensitive to the sloppy behavior, more likely to do unexpected things. Funny when it's my brother. 
 




 Don't give him a gun for his b-day, k? 




 Protip: if the sound you imagine when you see their face ranges from **DURRRRRRRRRRRR** to *uhhhhhhhhhhhhh*, you might be working with a [dim bulb](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dubbya).   




 It's always bizarre to me the things that the FBI/NSA does crack ahead of time, and then stuff like this where he claimed to plan for six months, was a mess, more than likely posted shit online or searched - yet, they're sending out notices to people about illegally downloading media. I respect the rights of artists to make their money but GMAFB.  




 That is so spot on it's painful.  




 Yeah. Droopy lids, a slackjaw. He's a motherfucking yokel. Whoever gave him the gun is equally liable; anyone with half a brain could see he's a bad news bear.  




 What an awful terrorist. "stupid kid"? He's older than the Boston Bomber and killed more people.
