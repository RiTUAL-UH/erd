 Oh, I dunno. District 9 had a lot of fake documentary stuff in it and it made a lot of money.  




 Wow. That just made me hate violence more than a billion hippies could have.  









 No, that's /r/games. /r/gaming would taste like a picture of cold pizza and coke.  




 Eventually they won't be able to pay someone to C D that 3D remake of Chrono's Trigger.  









 That was in No Country for Old Men.  




 I like the silent movie cartoon style showing of the artist's hand.  









 He would have been almost alone then. Pretty sure critics tore this movie a new one back in the day.  




 Whiskey or no sale! 




 I'm still holding on to my belief that this whole Star Wars thing will never catch on.  




 Isn't the point of this supposed to be that the guy is judged differently on the basis of his looks? What's the point of showing different women?  




 Okay, in this book I'm working on I have character A and B. They're sisters. A is a button down, rule-following, reliable salt of the earth type who works the family garden, and B is a more devil may care, adventurous one and the parents tolerate it because in her adventures she has made the family more money than her sister. Both of them want to leave home but the outside world is too big and scary since their village is surrounded by vast jungle and on the other side of that are strange communities. One day there is a huge crisis in the village and in the end, both of them are instrumental in saving the day. 

Which sounds more interesting as a postscript: 

A. Characters A   B, having proven to themselves that they're up to facing the dangers of life head on and left their family with enough money to get by without them, plunge into the largely unknown darkness seeking new sights, new experiences, etc. Character B is more outspoken in her enthusiasm while B is more quietly excited. 

B. Character A finds that now that she's experienced real danger, she's more of an adrenalin junkie than her sister, who learns that real danger isn't as much fun as the trouble she used to get in. So  Character A wants to set out on this adventure and Character B goes along to look out for her sister and to not look like a coward. 

Thank you for your time  




 Did Frozen get rereleased?  




 Credit to /u/usedthrone for the title.  









 How early can a fetus be aborted and still have its fetal tissue be usable? Is that a situation where the tissue is more usable early on? 




 Such a ninja.  




 I wouldn't get along with anyone if I was stuck in a bucket in the desert or wearing a heavy plastic casing.  




 And people doubted the effectiveness of abstinence only education! 




 Damn. He forgot to bring the cow.  




 I don't get the pun.  




 Or very badly abused, but that's just speculation.  









 For double price, Lynch will provide a commentary track where he explicitly says what everything means.  




 Oh. Thought this was that normalpornfornormalpeople stuff.  




 So, are you in a sem-rural area?

I am, and the library I work at still has people checking out the VHS tapes. It's amazing to me.  




 The shit you could get away with when you didn't need to bother with sound on the day.  




 Inspired by this joke: https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3d5m8z/backstreet_boys_and_nsync_members_are_apparently/ct29g5a?context=3

Anyway, if the sacrifices to keep the "Gods" happy affect every country in CitW, they can effect every religion. Different types of religious/supernatural figures are featured in the movie and various supernatural means are used to defeat the monsters that get unleashed (e.g. the Japanese kids putting their pursuer back to spiritual sleep) One of those in question can be the God/Satan of Christian theology. That hand that emerges at the end of the movie? That's Satan's or a being like it. And then he made his way to LA for This is the End.  









 Rarity does the same thing when Sweetie Belle tries to touch her sewing machine. 

She's generous like that.  




 FRIENDSHIP IS MMAAAAAAAAAAGGGICCCCCCCC!! 




 Have any companies done field tests with them? Is it anywhere near economically viable? If not automobiles where there's the risk of crashing, how long range have, say, automated drones been able to go? 




 It's also a secret sequel to This is The End.  




 That movie was such Razzie bait.  




 I read in some book that they don't like the word OK being said in their headquarters cause it's one of the most commonly used words in the English language and they want Coke to overtake it. Is that based on a true thing or an urban legend?  




 I like this Sons of Anarchy reboot.  




 Does the lack of an L have some meaning? 




 The Fantrapulous Inventions of Horatio Huffnagel  




 No you don't.  




 Basically in The Running Man the novel he's constantly on the run in the regular world. He's hiding out in a ghetto, jacking cars and planes, etc. Basically a fugitive. In the movie he's put in a gladiatorial ring. It's a weird change that they probably made for budgetary reasons.  




 Is this that Vice video?  




 You're the grandmother.  




 You mean she was stealing glances Craig's shoulder while writing her FiM? 




 Notice me, Sentwi!  




 You know, I thought that throwback face was really cute. But it probably would get a bit tiresome after awhile.  




 I trust there will be a wet hair, short hair Rarity soon.  




 Can't remember any that have happened to me recently except I was going to a temp job at four in the morning, couldn't see a thing, got completely lost so I just pulled into a random building to ask for directions, and it turned out that was where I was supposed to go.  




 It's your body's way of making your death feel like more of a relief.

 With no skin, muscles, or anything, it gets really cold out of the water.  




 I sometimes feel kinda bad eating cows, deer, and pigs. Chicken I can eat all day guilt free. If for some reason I could only eat the animals I killed myself, I'd have to go exclusively with chickens at least for awhile.  




 In very large part it's because Larry the Cable Guy was in it, and many of the leftist critics hate him and his fanbase.  









 This explains all the anti-vax horseshit.  




 Wasn't there some big deal made about how it takes forever for anyone to strip in this movie?  




 I need to give that movie another try. I've heard it was beautiful but I just wasn't in the mood last time.  




 Well, I think Thor is explicitly said to be magical, so I think that makes it kind of not sci-fi. I have the same issue with Star Wars.  




 Probably because stormfront or some group like that vote brigaded this.  




 I assume the squirrel's estate will be contact about this.  




 Sheriff Lobo movie now inevitable.  




 I believe I've heard that China only sends about 25% of the grosses from overseas movies screened in their country. If that's true. is that exceptionally low? Normal?  




 Oh, I hope they give Nina Paley a gig eventually based on this.  









 Pretty much all three commentary tracks for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas are good. Gilliam has all the good anecdotes, the actors are pretty funny too, and Thompson goes bugshit on his.  




 Inglourious Basterds's trailer highlighting all the moments of violence, not really featuring the subplot about Dominique, etc.

 "Hey, dude, your wife's a horse." 
"... What?" 
"I'm a *what*?" 




 "How much for the second one?" 

"Oh, it's free too!"  




 Ah, six whole years ago.  




 Plus she did that butt bounce during the pig song anyway, so she barely even needs magic.  




 Please oh please don't make it like Roberto Benigni's.  




 Ran's. Blind guy standing in front of a cliff. It's a great metaphor, but it doesn't beat you over the head with it.  




 Where are the unicorns? Where's the character Darkness?  




 Who needs more Union monuments? The intact USA is way the hell better than a thousand monuments would be.  




 Jurassic World. Your argument is invalid.  




 The ending of Plague Dogs.  




 Large parts of it are just boring. I'd rather watch something intentionally funny than have to wait dozens of minutes at a stretch for something campy to happen.  




 Was this comic written by aliens?

 Either the best "Game Over" screen or the best "A Winner is You" screen.  




 Undercooked? 




 Return of the Killer Tomatoes did it better about seven years earlier: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogId4kCae1A 









 It's more like it was too offensive for Disney to release with their label, so they made a small company called Excalibur specifically to distribute it for them.

 The rescue scene alone seemed supercontrived.  




 Imagine doing that to one of those giant ant colonies that carver ants and the like make.  




 Lately I've been walking to and from work while wearing a sleeveless shirt. As a result, my arms have tanned while my torso stayed pasty white. This morning I did some work digging up a shrub in an undershirt and missed putting sunscreen on both my upper shoulders. So when I took my shirt off, I had chocolate arms, strawberry lower shoulders, and vanilla upper shoulders and clavicles.

Tried to take a picture but my camera's a potato so it didn't really photograph very well.   




 It's such a tiny thing and I don't know if it was meant to be a joke, but I love that Hitler keeps calling his soldiers "guys." I love how even though he's fine with gunning them down to hit an enemy and clearly doesn't really care about them, on some level, he considers all those guys his bros.  









 You know, in non-Twilight stuff, Stewart and Pattinson have given some pretty good performances, so I think they actually could have pulled this off.  




 *Transformer noise* 









 But he was fine with Batman Forever? 









 Probably Pretty Woman, but it doesn't really get recommended to me much.  




 Uh, whose neck did Fluttershy accidentally break? 

The bear's. It was the bear's, wasn't it?  




 This feels like one of those hiatus posts but either way behind or way ahead of schedule.  




 Warning: Zalgo 




 Yesterday there was this guy who looked in pretty decent shape. He was there for awhile with someone and as far as I saw he was just doing a typical workout. But seemingly with every rep, he would make a "HHHRRRUUKK!" noise like he was about to vomit. It didn't sound like physical exertion. And he did this for half an hour, really loudly every time. I wasn't the only one that noticed him either, I heard other people commenting on it. So weird.  




 Hey, you know the old saying: No place is a good place.  




 I wonder what scene or draft they were at where that happened.  




 I've read a couple Olivia Goldsmith, Sandra Brown, and Jennifer Crusie books. 

So far it hasn't worked out particularly well for me.  









 I assumed if you knew what was being commented on, then it would be way easier to track them down and harass them.  




 Adjusted for creative accounting: $8.25.  









 You're doing the law of historical inevitability's work.  




 Please tell me Vasquez and company are killing some Na'vi.  




 Is the American Dream really to make a lot of money through mysterious means and then blow a big chunk on a vanity project people only enjoy most of a decade later ironically?

Cause if it is, looks like I'm on track.  




 Aww, and it got all dressed up to meet them and everything! 




 I really don't fantasize about being in a relationship anymore. Don't know why.  




 The gif cuts off before it zooms all the way out of the universe and then God rolls up the map.  




 That's called a moondog, right?  




 In short: MEDIOCRE! 




 Oh my lord are you correct.  




 I don't get then how the fault was supposed to lay with going from books to television. There were surely books as vacuous as television was at the time and TV broadcasts as thought-provoking.  




 70's folk singer-looking guy optional.  




 You'll need to cut it down to 25.

 Isn't A Confederacy of Dunces supposed to be a cursed script or something? Like a bunch of people who were intended to play the part died?  




 Did you count the number of swords?  









 Can't he use Fair Use copyright protection?  









 So, choose-your-own-adventure books where you have to flip through the pages one at a time will become a new fad?  




 Designed by Guillermo del Toro, I see.  




 I've read bunch of metal fans insist they've seen gigs that were just as bad as that.   




 ON FILM! I MEANT FIRST ON FILM! 

Oops.  









 It started back with The Matrix, it's just happening at an appropriately relaxed pace.  




 I heard awhile ago that the place isn't cleaned very well. Has anyone heard anything more recent about that? 




 But it was hardly a blockbuster.  




 I guess because otherwise the guy seems too dumb to be believable.  




 I worked for a summer at a restaurant a few years ago where any time a spatula fell on the floor, what we did was dunk the metal in the fryer for a few seconds. If your average fryer is indeed heated enough to kill whatever bacteria would have gotten on our spatulas from dropping them, how long would we have needed to dunk them? 

  




 Fucking sold.

"No, nobody brought an extra bag!"

 Falling asleep on the job. Not getting hired again.  




 In hindsight, it was unlikely that the deer would kill the bear in this video. 




 He was hanging out with Dali because he had a picture he needed made.  




 I'd be pretty mad if that ate my pussy.  




 A comic book movie sucking is hardly going to keep comic fans from talking about it. I hear people going on about that shitty old Captain America movie from the 90s.  




 There are Monsters is really, really cheesy.  




 Found out my parents were into bondage when I was nine because a pair of handcuffs fell out of their suitcase in front of me. At least, I HOPE that's what that was about.  









 I'm not disputing that humans evolved from the same thing primates did, but what animals preceded primates? Do we know what kind of mammals there were before that?
