 That article is really interesting! Thanks for all your comments. I understand much better now. :) 




 Or SNES for that matter I suppose.

Thanks!

ETA- Thanks for all the insight everyone! I have a much better understanding now. :3 




 FUCK YOU OLLY 




 NICE getting Mario and Luigi when I get home. :3 




 This looks like the game I want. :D 




 Yeah there is one for the university I work at. It seems to be geared towards students but maybe they would see me. I've been trying to figure out how to make an appointment without using the phone but I guess I'll just have to call them tomorrow. Thank you for your insight 




 The only medical person I have a relationship with is my OBGYN. Never got a GP since I moved here. : Gotta take care of the ladybits tho... 




 Nah. We didn't see bodies did we? 




 Which makes them main characters then, right? 




 DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG HE CARRIED THAT WATCH? EVER SINCE NAM, AND IT WAS NOT IN A PLEASANT ORIFICE. 




 ... really? 




 Crying for you ;-; 




 Uwaaaah that Ekans chu. 0-0 




 Black NN3DSXL, Blue DSi, Pink DS Lite, Cobalt GBA SP, Arctic Purple GBA, Yellow GBC. All still working just fine. :3 




 Her hair and clothes burnt off and she was entrapped in fire to the point where everyone thought she was dead. That was how I as a reader interpreted it. 




 ADWD Chapter 52 disagrees. 




 I feel like someone as attentive to detail as you would really get a lot out of reading the novels. 




 Ew. That sounds mighty unpleasant.  




 Daario.  




 The only reason the Chief ever lost a round of darts. 




 Oh that's a great suggestion. And thank you I will!  




 I was totally going to get them that until my bro said they were not going to Dublin. That failure prompted me to ask here. :) 




 He suffers from Gout. This is mentioned a couple times in S4, but not really made a big deal of like it is in the books. I bet lots of people were wondering. 




 White Walkers probably can't freeze the ocean but [ADWD](#b "wights can SWIM"). 




 Those are some great ideas! :D
 




 They will be in the southwestern part of Ireland for 13 days starting about August 5th. 




 Getting info from my bro is like pulling teeth but they aren't planning on going to Dublin apparently. :( Thanks for taking the time to make a recommendation and they definitely sound like awesome things to do! 




 Thank you that sounds awesome (to me, but then I like tourist trap stuff ehehe). I'm definitely considering that. 




 Hey that sounds fun! Thanks! :D 




 They are flying into Shannon and want to visit castles and such in the Southwest area. 




 Thanks! Will do. 




 My brother is getting married in a couple months and he and his fiancee are honeymooning in Ireland.

They have asked for wedding presents to be monetary contributions to their trip.

I'd like to keep to their wishes, but in a way that will make my gift be more memorable and meaningful than an amount of money going into a pool. I'm looking for museum tickets or special excursion passes that I can pre-purchase for them and give to them at the wedding. 

Please share recommendations! Thank you! 

Also I have been informed they intend to stick to the southwestern parts of the country to see greenspace and castles. 




 Wow! Glad you're doing better! 




 I'm sorry to hear that. :( Hopefully my body will! I have never tried anything but combination pills before so here's hoping. 




 Good news! Thanks. :) 




 I suffer anxiety too. It's never as bad as we think it's going to be and always better if you come clean sooner.  




 Thanks 




 LSH? 




 Oh no ;_; 




 Definitely! 




 He told me I had to make extra sure to take the pill at the same time each day.

He switched me because my blood pressure was a little higher than it was a year ago when I was first prescribed the pill. 

Thanks!

(Also how bout those new guidelines saying get a pap every three years if you're over 26? Heck yesssssss) 




 Pokemon Conquest maybe. I never hear anybody talk about it and it's so much fun. 

Also, Pokemon Ranger.  




 They didn't have to build campfires. Ramsey did that for them. 




 Well probably that it was sooooo up close and larger than life and she was riding it. That's what I thought at least. 




 Stannis' face in that show was that of a broken and desperate man. I knew right away what he was going to do. 




 Didn't he and Jorah glimpse a dragon briefly when they sailed through Valyria? 




 I'm guessing it has something to do with LP size records first coming out in 1948. That probably made it easier to distribute songs for home listening, like say at a holiday party. 




 He's a person and his name is Chewbacca. 




 It's my new favorite movie. I thought it was incredibly inspirational and one of the most creative movies in a very long time. 




 I mainly research Civil War POWs, and there were a few anecdotes in this podcast that stuck with me.

1. German POWs in Aliceville had so much food they buried the extra to get rid of it

2. American officials treated the German POWs so well because they feared retaliatory treatment of American POWs (but then continued after they discovered how American POWs were really treated).

It's amazing how 80 years, a World War, and an important treaty changed ideas towards POWs in this country. For those interested in reading a modern historical perspective on POWs in the American Civil War, I recommend [While in the Hands of The Enemy](http://www.amazon.com/While-Hands-Enemy-Conflicting-Dimensions/dp/0807130613). It's very critical of both sides and their treatment of POWs.  




 My Japanese DS games (Jump, Taiko) play on my NN3DSXL. 




 37 




 I think that looks awesome! 




 That would be so 90's throwback, especially in clear light purple. :D 




 If you go to the game in the Eshop and click repair, that may fix it. It did for me. 




 It's beautiful inside and the meal (lunch) we had was delicious. :) It made me happy to be there!

 A really nice metal tool box is an AWESOME gift for an archaeologist. I love mine. 3 




 [I always recommend Death by Theory](http://www.amazon.com/Death-Theory-Tale-Mystery-Archaeological/dp/0759119589)

It is a great way to introduce yourself to archaeological theory and how attitudes about it changed over time. It's also a quirky mystery novel! 




 Aww yay anthropology :) This was my first post in this sub!
