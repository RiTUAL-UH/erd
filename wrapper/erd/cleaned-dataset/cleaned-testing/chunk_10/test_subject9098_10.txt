 That's what I was thinking, but they never really acknowledge it beyond the phone call conversation. 




 True, but I wonder if he just says that to Marty and it's not actually true.  Otherwise, why would Doc be so confident standing in front of the Delorean while Einstein is being sent ahead 1 minute?  Doc and Marty easily could have been ran over if the experiment with Einstein failed. 




 So at the beginning of the first movie, Marty shows up at Doc's place and all of the clocks are being shown.  While Marty is talking to Doc on the phone the clocks all ring 8:00 am and Doc says "That means my experiment worked".  Referring to the clocks all being 25 minutes slow.  What experiment is Doc referring to in regards to the clocks?  Did he possibly time travel already himself?  If he already time traveled, then that would make sense that he knows Marty will be at his place at that time.  Otherwise, why would Doc call his own home if there shouldn't be anyone there to answer? 




 He only has 1 win. That's why he isn't locked in yet. 




 Yeah, it would have to be for wide release.  I know Grand Budapest Hotel was over $200,000 for its opening weekend.  I'm thinking that's the highest ever, bud something may have beaten it since it came out. 




 My cats breath smells like cat food. 




 Old North posted a picture the other day on facebook with their craft beers.  It had all of them for $5 a pint.  It didn't list the domestic beers, so not sure what those will be aside from cheaper than the craft beers.

 Harvick is apparently getting enough top 10's between this year and last year that Outback put a stipulation on it.  When hearing the advertisement on the radio for one race they mentioned a limit of 1 per table.  I don't think they had that in the past. 




 Burninator! 




 And of course they left the entire category for the end of the round. My brother and I thought for sure that Richard Petty would be one of the answers before they even started. 




 Lucas knows you made a typo in the title. 




 I was down there in 2012 and stopped by Hnedrick the Friday before the 600 and they had a bunch of stuff going on.  Inflatable things and I think a few small rides for kids.  Concession stands and small games to play.  Drivers talking and some autographs.  They didn't have anything extra opened up for the garage area or shop/museum though.  We actually had to park in one of the lots for the track and they bussed people in and out of the place since there wouldn't have been room for parking there. 




 Has anyone thought that maybe John not being human isn't actually a spoiler?  It could be something that's made known at the beginning of the movie and everything goes from there.  Maybe there's a human John in the future that the machines have captive and they send the cyborg back in his place?  Just a thought. 




 Wait, so Boris is 52 years old?  Or is that date wrong too? 




 Help us Obi Wan Nintendo.  You're our only hope. 




 Marvel did make the movie because they had the rights for using Hulk.  But the 2003 movie doesn't intertwine with the story of any of the current ones.  The 2008 Hulk includes Nick Fury at the end to connect it with all the other current Avenger characters. 




 And then they give the call to start the engines for an Xfinity race and no one hears a sound.  That'd be weird. 




 Nope.  It doesn't have any tie ins with the current movies.  The Hulk starts with the 2008 movie with Edward Norton. 




 Actually less than a decade.  These Marvel movies began in 2008, and we're getting the 11th and 12th ones both in 2015. 




 Yup, that's exactly what it is. 




 I wouldn't say the Wii was the least popular version of the game.  RB 1 and 3 sold more on the Wii than the PS3 and weren't much behind the 360 either. 




 For the first round of the Chase each driver gets 3 bonus points awarded to them per win of the regular season.  So in the example, Harvick would start the Chase with 6 more points than Johnson. 




 Go is definitely a good one here. 




 The other 2 for Jimmie are Chicagoland and Kentucky.  Last year he finally crossed Michigan off his winless list. 




 They are already planning on releasing 4 in 2017 though.  I believe with the same main toys. 




 The whole lineup of Cinnamon, Frosted, etc. are definitely the best EVER! 




 Not possible.  I don't have one. 




 Yup.  Jayski only has those 2 listed for penalties from last weekend. 




 Would that rule be changed since the post Bowyer spin debacle though?  After that NASCAR said drivers have to give 100% or risk being penalized. 




 **Jimmie Johnson**  After you were eliminated from the Chase last year, how much were you guys using the remaining races to prepare for the 2015 season? 




 I don't believe you.  I'm 35 and drink/get drunk regularly and I never get hangovers.  They went away during my college years. 




 Thanks.  This is just what I was looking for! 




 If not an app, then is there possibly another way aside from me manually putting them all in my phone? 




 They are each at the end of the months you listed. 




 Don't listen to the others. I'm 34 and basically since college I almost never get hangovers. And I drink every weekend. So there is hope that they get better instead of worse for you over time. 




 It's probably the Biff borrowing the firesuit.  He just wants some attention. 




 Last year I just wore my coat the entire time.  It didn't seem to get too warm with it on in there. 




 As lawnmower_of_destiny said, compared to other generations, the gap isn't that large.  PS2 was at 150M+, compared to GC and Xbox both in the lower 20M range.  PS1 was just over 100M compared to N64 with just 33M.  SNES compared to Genesis is a bit closer at 49M to 29M.  But regardless if you look at the percentages of sales, the Wii over PS3 and X360 is considerably smaller than any of the previous 3 generations. 




 I wouldn't call it a large margin.  Wii has sold about 101 million compared to about 85 million each for PS3 and Xbox 360.  The Wii jumped out to a huge lead initially, but then slowed a bunch after a few years while the other 2 were still selling really well. 




 Lesbian seagull? 




 I see a new super hero movie coming out....The Human Calculator vs. Numero Uno! 




 He looks so content with his beverage now.  Like a little kid just wanting their blanket. 




 Where are you buying enough oil for a vehicle for under $10?  Quarts of oil are over $3 a piece.  And pretty much any vehicle requires 4-5 quarts.  Even if you buy the larger 5 quart container it isn't much savings.  Either way, I'm agreeing with you that it isn't worth doing it yourself for the price it can be done at a store.  Maybe a $5 savings by doing it yourself for most vehicles with standard oil. 




 Tyler Perry's Madea goes to Space! 




 I personally would go with the shirt.  As ForwardBound mentioned, your legs don't really get too cold.  Especially after you start the run. 




 Since when are people allowed to bring their phone/camera into the emergency room before a surgery? 




 Believing advice found on Reddit. 




 I got a lot of problems with you people! 




 I definitely understand where you're coming from.  It would make more sense to call his titles Winston Cup titles.  Or at the very least maybe leave the sponsorship out of it altogether.  Just say he won 7 Cup titles and leave it be. 




 It makes it sound like he just keeps on winning more titles! 




 True, they can see if the 5 lugs are glued to the rim before being carried over the wall.  But it's still possible for one to fall off in the process of putting the tire on.  Maybe the tire changer would just skip the one that fell off and only use 4.  And you're right that the RR tire can be over the line and still be a legal pit stop.  The RF would not be allowed over the line. 




 The change didn't say anything in regards to being able to have less than 5 lug nuts on each wheel.  They still need all 5 on the car, they just don't have to be tight.  So there will still be 43 officials out on pit road to see if all 5 get put on each wheel.  Plus they have to check to see if the car is fully in the pit box.
Edit: Typed Loose instead of tight initially 




 I never really understood how an offical is able to tell if a lug nut is fully tight or not from their view.  What specifically did they look for to be able to see this?  Because if it's screwed on 80% of the way, but just not tight, wouldn't it be pretty tough to tell that it's loose? 




 NASCAR would still need an official at each pit stall.  They'd still be checking to make sure 5 lug nuts were put on each tire (this article says they just don't have to be tight, doesn't say they can be missing), the car is within the pit box, tires aren't just freely rolled back to the wall, etc. 




 DENTAL PLAN 




 You'll be fine.  I went from 20 years old to 30 between visits.  They didn't jusge me and I had no cavities!  So I'm good for another 10! 




 I agree with you that it needs to help Nintendo sell systems.  But for the current install base it's a good start over just 3 days. 




 Considering there are only 3 million Wii u's in the U.S., that's 1 out of 6 people who bought the game in the first 3 days.  Doesn't seem so bad in that regards. 




 And it put them on the map! 




 So it'll definitely be lower than the previous two for the whole weekend then. 




 First see if 4K home technology catches on before worrying about something like this. 




 Yeah, the robots fighting is definitely the main attraction for the movies.  Acting, not so much. 




 The company wasn't trying to make an evil transformer to accomodate the bounty transformer.  They were making transformers to assist with stuff along the lines of military use.  The problem was that they linked it to Megatron's memory and that is what made it evil.  From there Megatron/Galvatron was able to control the other transformers created by the company.  In regards to the bounty transformer, he was working in secret with whatever the government agency Kelsey Grammar worked for.  Their job was hunting down any hiding transformers.  The bounty hunter was working with them in order to capture Optimus for himself. 




 I don't recall reading anything specifically saying it only applies to the final 4. But I assumed it will be that way and other drivers still get bonus points for their finishing positions. 




 Bought Korn's re-issued latest album in August at Best Buy.  It was an exclusive release through them. 




 That makes sense.  Thanks! 




 During Gordon's interview he called Brad a dipshit and it was aired on tv.  I know it's been a while, but back in 2004 when Dale Jr won at Talladega (I believe his 5th time) he said "shit" during an interview and was fined and docked points for saying that during a live interview.  Jr was fined 25 points, which would be about equivalent to 6 points today.  Why wouldn't Gordon get penalized for the same thing? 




 Drivers licenses do expire, at least in Ohio.  It says right on it "Expires on" and then has the date.  They expire when you turn 21, and then every 4 years afterwards.  And a bar can legally turn someone down if they are trying to use an expired ID even if it says they are clearly over 21. 




 Doubtful that NASCAR was popular since the 1930's, considering it didn't exist until 1948.  However, racing in general was popular since the 1930's in the southeast. 




 The odds of that are approximately 3,720 to 1. 




 Correct! 




 Here's an easy one.  What's the only track that Jeff Gordon has finished 43rd at?  And he's actually done it twice and this track.
