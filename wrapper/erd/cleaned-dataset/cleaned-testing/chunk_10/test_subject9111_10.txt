 I don't know how to begin processing that. 




 I had a reoccurring nightmare as a kid. It wasn't as classically horrible as a demon face or being chased or anything like that. In my dream I had a bird's-eye view of my bedroom, except that there was nothing in it at all (no furniture, no toys, not even carpeting) and the walls and floor were painted a perfect, seamless, unblemished white. I would look down from the ceiling of my room and directly below me was a brown circle that over the months I came to realize was the top of someone's head, but that was all I could see of them, the top of their head. I have no idea to this day who that person was. I would stare down at this unmoving person for a time, unable to move or say anything, then slowly the ceiling would recede straight up, taking me with it. But the strangest thing was that in my peripheral  could tell that the walls were still attached, but that they weren't stretching up with me. It's really hard to explain that in my unavoidable concentration on this person's head as it receded dozens of feet below me slowly but surely that I could tell that on the sides I was only five or so feet above them still. I felt like I was drifting in a way, and my stomach felt strangely sunken, as if it were collapsing in on itself. To make matters worse for the entirety of this nightmare Mary Had A Little Lamb would play voicelessly on repeat in the background. This nightmare scared me in a way that I couldn't articulate at such a young age and still have trouble with today. It's really difficult to get across accurately just how empty, alone, small, and terrified I felt drifting up on that ceiling away from the only other sign of life. 




 That is the only story from those books that actually scared/disturbed me. I still can't think about it and it's been 8+ years. 




 Well, it would be interesting to know what is was, but I can only feel that you dodged a bullet not getting first hand experience. Thanks for sharing and I hope you find out some day, or at least find someone with a similar experience to talk to.  




 that's super creepy. or maybe they knew better than to admit they had seen it. did you ever hear of any missing children while you lived there? 




 did you ever ask any of the other kids in your apt. if they had ever seen it? 




 I did some more research and you are right. It definitely was real, although it was hard to find anything concrete about the show at first. The actress was a bust for anything concrete, the publisher I found for it was a bust, and imdb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Wikipedia were no help. However, I did find a thread by someone that was able to answer pretty much all questions, or at least hypothesize sufficiently.

Just wanna say thanks for the post!
