 Absolutely.  Whole foods are always the safest way to go. :)  




 Be careful with this. Maybe your school is different, but when I was in college the online info wasn't accurate.  I worked in the dining halls and even though cooks are supposed to follow recipes,  sometimes they'd alter them. Add a little extra oil, or if we were short on an ingredient we'd substitute it with something else. Or the website wouldn't get updated and calorie counts would be off. It's a nice guide, but in my experience not extremely accurate.   




 Just because someone doesn't want a dog and doesn't want to deal with them doesn't make them lazy. People can not want a dog, and still have healthy relationships with people; people who will live longer than a dog.  




 Had potato soup last night. Don't have an exact recipe.  Bus basically it had potatoes,  carrots,  broccoli,  little bit of cheese, little bit of half and half,  chicken broth, and some random seasonings.  I've started making creamy soups with part cream and part broth and it turns out tasty for less calories. :)  




  Not sure if this is the type of thing you're talking about, but check out www.walking4fun.com 




 Sargento also has a line of "ultra thin" sliced cheeses that range from about 40 to 45 calories a slice.  




 I always buy the zero calorie sprays. I think if you spray for a few seconds it's 0, but if you spray longer it's a couple calories.  




 Thanks for the recipe!  I love overnight oats :) 




 Thanks!  :) 




 Could you explain this pumpkin ice cream? 




 Haven't lost anything in my boobs, or if I have it isn't noticeable in the way my bras fit.  




 Love the flatout line of tortillas,  flatbread, etc.  




 Also king Arthur flour has a blog and recipe index with lots of good easy bread, cracker, tortilla,  muffin, etc. recipes.   




 I tend to switch it up. But I recently came across this sourdough recipe. http://www.reformationacres.com/2010/12/whole-wheat-sourdough-sandwich-bread.html but I cut out the brown sugar because I wanted the sourdough flavor to be stronger.  1 ounce of the bread is about 70 calories I believe. 

I also recently made a banana cashew chocolate bread. I can't seem to find it right now. But basically take your favorite banana bread recipe and add a handful of chocolate chips to the mix. Then spoon half the batter into pan. Mix cashew butter with a bit of oil to thin it out, and pour over batter. Pour rest of batter into pan and use knife to swirl the butter throughout the batter. So yummy.  




 I'm a big time snacker. Especially where I'm currently working. Lately my work lunch/snack has been:

3 ounces baby carrots (35 calories)

2 ounces low sodium deli meat (60 calories)

1 ounce block cheese (120 calories)

1 serving of dried fruit (about 100 calories)

114g low fat cottage cheese (90 calories)

Piece of homemade bread (about 150 calories) - could bring crackers or granola bar or something else.



I think that adds up to about 550 calories.  Which is basically my breakfast/lunch.


If you're into actual put together lunch.  Cottage cheese mixed with tuna in a lettuce wrap is my go to and high in protein.  




 To my boyfriend's dismay, my butt went first too.  Wish we could pick where to lose.  




 Had some leftover crusty buns I made, but didn't know what to do with. So I made this for brunch today. Turned out very yummy. Thanks for the recipe!  :) 




 Think they were talking about StealthRR.  




 I had 4 taken out at once as well. I was told not to use a straw because the sucking could mess with stitches,  so keep that in mind with smoothies. I ate a box of mac and cheese. Typically that's not low cal, but if was the only thing I ate. Just test that it's cool enough with a finger if your mouth is numb still. I was starving after they were removed and couldn't wait a couple hours to eat.  




 Your breakfast sounds yummy.  




 Thanks I'll try it next time :) 




 Is the Buffalo rub super spicy?  




 Thanks. Good luck :) 




 I started with similar stats. F24/5'5"/165 lbs. Now I am at 148. I've been logging calories on my fitness pal for 87 days. Haven't worked out much. I play pick up volleyball at the local school once a week. And try to go on walks, but haven't done any serious workout routines. I eat between 1200 and 1300 calories a day. Definitely track calories. It's the only way to lose.  




 "Heres what happens: Grapefruit contains furanocoumarins, which block an enzyme that normally breaks down certain medications in the body. When it is left unchecked, medication levels can grow toxic in the body.

Its not just grapefruits, either. Other citrus fruits such as Seville oranges (often used in marmalade), limes, and pomelos also contain the active ingredients (furanocoumarins), but have not been as widely studied."

 Most nutrition information for meat is for the raw weight. Unless it specifically says cooked on the nutrition label.   




 Looks delicious!  Love finding new ways to eat cottage cheese.  :) 




 Weight always trumps number of pieces. With canned items a lot of times the juice/liquid is also included in the count. If you have canned corn or beans, the weight is based on the liquid as well. 




 I was looking on their website and couldn't find anything.  Thanks for the idea! 




 Just looked at your breakfast post, looks delicious to me. :) 




 Exactly.  




 I'm a cashier on my feet currently,  but soon will be back working in a kitchen.  Play volleyball once a week, and walk or bike everywhere.  I aim for 1200 but on days I play volleyball I eat a little extra. For me this is temporary for weight loss.  When I reach my goal my TDEE will be about 1500.  




 I might do that.  My TDEE is about 1700, just hate having maintenance days because the weight loss is slow to begin with.  




 I would just eat 1000 calories there and not eat lunch, but the same day we are going out to lunch too :/  




 Awesome thanks :) 




 Thanks :)
