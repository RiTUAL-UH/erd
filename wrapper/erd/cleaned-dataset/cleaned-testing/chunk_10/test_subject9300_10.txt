 Im 17 years old going into my senior year in high school.  The past years of high school have been rough.  Freshman year most of my friends went off to hang out with other cliques and shit and started acting like dicks (HIGHSCHOOL WOW).  In the winter of my sophomore year I got diagnosed with fucking type 1 diabetes. I'm to embarrassed to tell anyone I'm diabetic which leads to me not taking insulin for days on end.  After I got hit with diabetes about two years ago I really stopped giving a fuck.  I started smoking weed and drinking shortly after getting it, my grades went to shit too.

As soon as I discovered weed I knew I was gonna be hooked.  It was the easiest way to get rid of all of my problems temporarily and I loved it, I was smoking 4 times a day by that summer.  In my head I knew getting diabetes triggered all this drug use and shit but I really didn't care, I never really valued myself before I got diagnosed but the way I saw it getting diabetes was my excuse to get away with a ton of shit.  

My parents first caught me with weed a week after I smoked for the first time.  They drug tested me and then took my shit, my Dad whooped my ass and then screamed at me to never do it again.  I promised him I wouldn't but I was fucking lying right through my teeth.  I was so fucking mad the first time I got caught, I felt like I never got my turn to actually experiment with weed before I got caught.  

Getting caught by my parents triggered a whole downward cycle.  They would catch me like once every two weeks after that and I was grounded 24/7.  Obviously I wasn't going to stop smoking weed so I could be ungrounded so, I constantly snuck out and ran away to go get drunk or high with my friends. This went on for about 6 months and as time went on my relationship with my parents got worse.  To the point where my mom refused to speak to me for a week after I didn't confess to stealing $500 from her wallet (money that was supposed to be spent on my Dad for his birthday.  I'm such a piece of shit I know).  

Last January I ran away one evening and took 25i NBOME (pretty much fake lsd- I thought It was real at the time) and had a horrible trip.  During the trip I felt like my life was stuck in the same 1 hour loop for eternity along with some other scary shit.  Afterwards though I was fucking losing my mind.  My ego was completely shattered and all I wanted to do when I got home was apologies to my parents and cry with my Mom.  I though I had given myself brain damage so after coming clean to my parents I vowed to stay sober and rebuild my relationship with my parents (no brain damage though).

My Mom put me in therapy that February and I started taking anti anxiety meds soon after.  I thought that if I cleaned up my act it would help me understand more about who I am but that didn't work at all and after suffering for two months sober I started doing drugs again last April.

It's July now.  Im still stealing from my parents to buy weed.  I hate myself completely but I don't care about myself enough to fix anything.  My parents are really pushing my to go to collage but I'm really not interested at all.  I feel as if this is all being forced upon me and I don't get a say.  All my parents seem to care about is getting me into a collage so they can go brag to their fucking friends about me.  They make me so fucking mad.  I'm still in therapy but it really isn't helping.  My parents caught me again and I got into a huge fight with my Dad where I ended up running away, stealing a 40 oz from 711 and sleeping on a park bench.  My parents  I just don't care about anything in anymore.  My life is meaningless, all life is in general.  It's impossible for anyone to be content ever.  I feel that because I'm aware of the sad reality of this world i'll never be able to be happy.  I don't want to pick a career, I don't want to go to collage and I really don't want to live anymore. 

The only thing stopping me from jumping off a bridge one night is my irrational fear that when we die we stay in our bodies unable to move or communicate.  Thus leaving me stuck inside a box for all of eternity.  That wouldn't explain what would happen to people who are cremated though.  I digress 
This may sorta come out funny cuz I just wrote this while alone and drunk in my basement.  I am a complete nobody with no interests no skills and no motivation to do anything about it.  
normally reread my reddit posts but im too drunk for that shit sorry for spelling 
TL;DR: I'm a self destructive idiot who feels sorry for himself. 




 I feel you man.  I'm 16 and I pretty much know i'm going to be in the same boat when I'm 19.  I've been dreading my birthdays for the past year.

 Hello I am building my pc based of the great build at http://www.logicalincrements.com. The website recently changed the recommended graphics card from the Asus Radeon R9 to the Gigabyte Geforce GTX 660 and I was wondering which one would perform better for gaming?
