 Civilisation is death. Turn based games are usually bad for me, but that one has literally taken weeks of my life.  




 You're either an existing redpiller who is advertising for the sub, or you're very, very naive.  




 So what's your job? You'd better be an astronaut or you are one hell of a cunt.  




 The goal of the conversation is to enjoy the conversation. If you're willing to spend ages having a boring conversation just to get laid, then you're way over invested in sex for the sake of sex, and you need to start expanding some other areas in your life. E.g being more than a walking penis, and treating women like more than a walking vagina. Why would you ever want to be with someone who isn't interesting to talk to? 




 There are only two numbers on the hotness scale. 0 - people you are not attracted to, and 1, people you are. If you desire to have sex with them, do it. If you're worried that other people will say you're not with a girl who is attractive enough, then you need serious work on your inner game and not caring about what other people think of you.  




 You're making the massive assumption that you can't be popular and get laid at the same time. All of the most popular men I know are drowning in the pussy, because women are above all attracted to social status. Far from being totally separate, the person you are describing would be the person who gets laid the *most*. 




 How the fuck do you define a 'WoW 10?' Someone with cooler swords and stuff than the other girls? 




 I am greatly looking forward to this.  




 Yes.  




 Blogspam 




 Well done mate, keep up the good work.  




 she's trying to fit in with her group

That's not a valid reason for anyone outside of preschool. Judge away.  




 Seddit usually has a strong reaction against female-authored posts, with the whole 'fish teaching a fisherman' thing, and I usually disagree and advocate for them because they have merit. 

This one, unfortunately, proves the stereotype. There's a lot of stuff in here that's worthy of tumblr tween relationships and not much else. It breeds insecurity and counterproductive mindsets. Take it with a very large grain of salt.  




 if you walk like a wealthy man, you must be a wealthy man

Are you implying that an arbitrarily larger number of digits in a bank account magically causes peoples' hip rotator muscles to habitually contract? Or is it the massive weight of that credit card that makes them walk like a retard? 




 Since when do all text conversations start out boring? 




 Have you ever actually met someone who threw out clothes because they were 'out of fashion' after a year? Because I never have.  




 I'm pretty sure at least 95% of the people on Tindr downloaded it out of curiosity. 




 ASD 




 Suppressive fire, don't let her outflank you 




 Aragon had serious oneitis. Could have been spinning that HB 8 plate Eowyn the whole time. She's such a feminazi with the whole "I am no man" thing though. /s 




 Best answer: try it yourself and see if it works.  




 Assuming that maths is the only measure of intelligence

Further assuming that someone who is good at maths will make for intelligent conversation - which is what OP is looking for - more so than someone who reads classic literature 




 It may be for you, it isn't for some other people. 

That's not because you're good looking or more muscly or whatever. For some people, 'romantic' behaviour - flirting, interpreting signals, displaying interest in the opposite sex, etc - just doesn't come natural at a base level. These kinds of people need to learn the long and hard way. And often being the kind of person who is very rational, intellectual and analytical, it most suits their natural talents to go about learning how to do these things in this way.  




 Ignore this guy, he's a fucking retard. 




 You're really fixated on this aren't you? You seriously don't believe that women can appreciate someone for anything other than their looks? You have no evidence that people do anything 'in general,' and you've said it yourself - you can think of tons of exceptions to the rule. You know what that means? It's not a rule.

Dude, for your sake, you need to go an read a LOT more inner game stuff, because these beliefs are a) extremely shallow and b) fucking you up.

Edit: you're also fixated on 'opening' my eyes.' Why should I, or anyone? If any male on this planet who is butt ugly is capable of pulling hot girls, why should he 'open his eyes' and give that up for your theory? 




 I can think of three guys off of the top of my head who are dating way outside their physical range. One of them is a real shocker and his girlfriend is fucking hot. So I guess you're the one kidding yourself. 




 Also, as things to be paraded around go, I's much rather models for the sub than something like the Mystery Method or anything advocating negging, which is where the sub gets its false reputation of being all redpill. Which understandably turns people off.  




 It has been repeatedly, endlessly proven that inner attractiveness is more important for men than outer attractiveness. 

Judging by this comment, your inner attractiveness needs some work, because you've got some limiting beliefs.  




 Such advice, many seduction 




 Guise DAE redpill 




 To be honest, I'm not sure that it was ever good advice. It taught you how to get women to have sex with you, yes, but it was by using lines, routines, negs, memorised bullshit; a fake personality to trick women into having a one night stand with you. It *worked* at the time because wholistic, life-appreciative approaches to pickup such as Manson's hadn't been developed yet and there was no alternative. But I still wouldn't recommend it.  




 Mystery method is crap, you want Mark Manson's 'Models.' 




 This might help. It helped me.

 I don't think they would even judge you. It would probably be envy along the lines of "I wish I was the one asking her out/I wish he was asking me out." 




 Or: take said text as an indicator of your success, ignore it, and keep going.  




 unlikely to change

There is no such thing. Nothing about your personality is nailed down. Nothing about is anything other than what you decide it is. Right now you are deciding that your personality sucks, and that's all that will come out in your behaviour. The first step is to decide that you are a good person, and as counterintuitive as it sounds, you will become it.  




 No it's not! I've worked hard and progressed steadily with every workout I've done, with the exception of one or two. I steadily added weight in exactly the way I should have - about 2.5kg per workout. Not 100kg at a time. That's fucking stupid.  




 I should mention that he's tiny and that's almost 3 times his body weight 




 That's like telling someone who wants to be an astronaut to go to space to get some experience.  




 Don't tell me what to do. 

Well done for owning up to not approaching, well done for actively trying to beat your AA (even if you had a little setback), and good luck tomorrow. Let me know how you go. You're awesome.  




 Yeah sorry, I was adding supporting evidence to your case.  




 Thanks man! Good to hear that all this feeds into fitness as well as other things.  




 Congratulations man! Keep up the good work! 




 Noob here. When I started I was deadlifting 20kg (40 pounds) - about a quarter of my bodyweight. After some work and dedication I am now DLing 70kg (140 pounds) - slightly less than my body weight. Now, or at any stage of that process, if someone had told me to try DLing 160kg (320 pounds) I would have very seriously injured myself. That is not a mental blockage or lack of effort. 

Edit: My PTs DL is about 180kg and he's been training for 14 years.  




 Can you explain some of what those changes were to me for my education please? Sincerely, a noob 




 You say you're balding and overweight? I'm moderately overweight (about 28% BF) and, as much as I know that I shouldn't care and be more self confident, I'm struggling with it. I'm lifting four times a week and working with a PT, but that isn't going to show for another four months at least, and in the mean time I'm really struggling to approach and display genuine interest because I don't see how any girl could find me attractive. I'm a university student, and for all of my advantages - fairly smart, high achieving, good sense of humour - there's always other guys who also have them and are ripped. 

What have your experiences been like with women when at less than 'average' physical attractiveness? How old are you? Is it different after uni when less men seem to be in good physical condition? How did you learn to not care about your body or face? Do you find that you need exceptional inner game compared to the men around you to make up for it, or is it more or les equal? How much do girls ACTUALLY care at various ages? I realise that having muscles and a low BF% is always an advantage but that doesn't happen overnight and I'm fucking sick of being single. I want to start working on game now, not in six months, because I feel like I'm wasting time and potential effort/knowledge/advancement. 

I realise that's a lot of questions, don't feel pressured to write me a book. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  




 "This video is not available" 




 I'm not very good looking. Think Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom) in 2006

Is having sex with random attractive girl like two hours later 




 now she's unconscious and in my van 




 Was really hoping for you in a car with a bug on the windscreen 




 Have you gained significant muscle mass? That would probably account for the weight similarity. 




 Sweet holy jesus 




 This is extremely well written. The dialogue and description quality matches up with most professional authors, as well as the narrative flow and structure. If this was you, OP, well done.  




 Now that you mention it, is moving out one of the steps too? 




 Source? 




 The question is, where do they go? 




 Precisely. 




 Sidebar please. 




 Maybe it wasn't in the US.  




 the fall of the Greek empire can be attributed to hot showers

As anyone who has ever opened a history book could tell you, this is such A-grade bullshit that I don't even know where to begin. How about the fact that there was no such thing as the 'Greek Empire?' 




 Ah, I see. 




 Are you sure that the non-dominant hand does the holding of the arm? I'm right handed, and I always hold my left arm with my right hand when I cross my arms. I just did it then. 




 I could become as outcome independent as I like, and someone being cold or standoffish to me if I'm being friendly still would strike me as irritating or rude. No, don't be *upset* by the interaction or let it affect your happiness, confidence or sense of self-value, but there's nothing wrong in being irritated by someone being rude to you. 

IMHO the whole point of Models is that you can be an attractive 'alpha' male without sacrificing your morals or being a dick to people, so at the end of the day, as long as whatever you're doing doesn't affect your happiness, confidence, or ability to give value, it really doesn't matter. Be nice to people who don't deserve it if you want to. You're then the bigger person.  




 Aww shucks. No one has ever called me handsome before. Thank you. 




 ... this is both what I want to be and my idea of a perfect day in a relationship. 




 Thank you! 




 Thank you! Looking back on my younger photos, I almost shaved it all this morning before I posted, but now I'm glad I didn't. 




 Thank you so much for this comment and for giving such detailed feedback. I really appreciate it. I've only lost about 8kg and I've probably got another 7-10kg to go, so I guess good things are in store. And that's quite true about my nose, I'd never thought of it that way. 




 You have no idea how much this comment means to me. I don't think anyone's said "you're quite attractive" to me in my life. Thank you.

P.S. I also have always thought that I had ugly eyes the colour of sewerage, there's something new. 




 Public transport, after a long day at work. Headphones on. Stare out the window. Bliss. 




 I'm definitely not an expert, but the folks over at /r/malehairadvice and /r/malegrooming are. 




 Dude... at least rotate them the right way up. 




 Got rejected yesterday. I'm 20 and I've had one girlfriend, which lasted for a month before she cheated on me. I'm trying hard to be confident and outgoing, but I can't help but think it's because it looks like baby me's face got run over by a tractor. Give me tips on things to change? Beard or no beard? Without facial hair it's hard to believe that I actually have a jawbone, so i've been rocking it for about two years now, but I'm not sure. If there was one thing I could change it would definitely be my nose, I want to chop it off. And then replace it with one half its size. Been going to the gym for about a month and a half, no change yet but I'm working on it, still have about 10% body fat to drop and a lot of muscle to gain before that looks decent. 

You're not getting any pictures of me smiling, I have braces at the moment and it's definitely still a work on progress. I know that looks hideous so there's not much point making anyone else endure it.

Me at the moment ([front](http://i.imgur.com/x2oxBE7.jpg), [side](http://i.imgur.com/l7qbxV7.jpg)), just got out of bed, had a pretty average haircut yesterday. 

[Me two years ago, with no beard](http://i.imgur.com/gEkthbW.jpg) - keep in mind that this was a professional photoshoot and it has been touched up, I just don't know in what way.

[Also me two years ago, in desperate need of a haircut.](http://i.imgur.com/O3lQCFW.jpg)

[Much older one of me \(around 16 y.o.\) looking dashing in costume.](http://i.imgur.com/8xk3P1E.jpg) 




 On top of what the others are saying, I think you could use a better haircut. 




 I was thinking a bit of Robert Downey Jr
