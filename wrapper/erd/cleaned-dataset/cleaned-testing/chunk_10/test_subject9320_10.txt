 put grape on poison and poison grape on mouth 




 I would like to purchase some history, math, and language text books like the ones you get in school.  




 Do you think Trump should have been more careful and said more specifically who he was against and what worries him. He knows Mexicans are hard workers. So if he generalized all of them on accident then that is the issue.  




 lol 




 I don't see enough discussion going on, just accusations. I understand peoples worries about issues even if I disagree with them. 




 The only people giving republicans bad names are themselves if they don't challenge Trump on what he is saying. I meant stereotyped, narrow-minded republican maybe.

 




 They don't even ask good questions. You have to specifically ask him if it is true that most immigrants from Mexico are criminals. Don't just say, would you take back anything you said? That's a cop out. They don't want to get involved with the mess.
 




 Saying all people from anywhere are rapists is factually wrong and ridiculous.
 




 Good information. Thanks.
