 And never will... 




 The non-dischargeability transfers.

Sorry for the boring answer.

 No idiot would believe what Gawker says?

You did. 




 Excellent news but statutory protections are ultimately still needed. The EEOC can later change its mind and - *poof* - there go these protections. 




 Man being publicly outed was my absolute worst nightmare scenario when I was closeted. What an awful thing for Gawker to do. 




 If this shuts down RFRA, I'm all for it. 




 Blue Ridge has a surprisingly large gay population. 




 The power of the Supreme Court rests almost exclusively on its perceived authority. If that credibility is lost, so is its power. Also, the Supreme Court has very little control over what subject matter it adjudicates - cases are brought to it, not the other way around.

The other two branches have military power (the President) and the power to tax and spend (Congress). 




 Individuals generally only file Chapter 11 if they have a lot of debt (specific numbers set by Congress).

The more common restructuring for individuals is Chapter 13. In a Chapter 13, the court essentially takes what you *have* to pay and spreads it out over a 3 to 5 year period and you pay monthly. 




  Scalia should serve as an example of what not to do.

I wonder how he will react if it ever dawns on him that he is tarnishing his legacy. 




 The non-dischargeability passes to the new loan. 




 Anyone know what cross street this is? 




 I tend to think you're being disingenuous at this point. Do you not recall the homosexuality/Chick-fil-A dustup?

If not, [here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick-fil-A_same-sex_marriage_controversy) the Wikipedia entry.

Clearly the public will not "punish" all businesses for being anti-homosexuality. We have a modern example where the business actually benefited from it. 




 So you don't think the government should be able to prevent a "Murder for Hire" business? 




 I am referring to "paying dearly" at the hands of society. Did Chick-fil-A benefit or lose from its anti-homosexuality position? 




  But in 2015, I don't know of any business that would discriminate against black people. And if they did, I think society would make sure they paid dearly for it.

If you think this argument works in the homosexual context, how do you explain Chick-fil-A? 




  I want to enable people to live freely.

Surely you acknowledge there are limitations (e.g., freedom to kill other people).

Non-discrimination in public accommodations is simply another reasonable limitation. The government has said that as a condition of receiving the perks of being a corporation, that corporation must follow certain rules, including not refusing service based on race.

The freedom argument only makes sense if you think, say, your freedom is unjustly restricted because you can't kill anyone you want. 




 Maybe it's sped up? 




 Boat drinks. Waitress I need two more boat drinks! 




 A SC Republican state politician rightly said that the flag flying on the capitol grounds had more to do with what was happening in the 1960s than the 1860s. 




 Elected officials generally can't be fired.

But if the clerk has a "shall" duty to issue marriage licenses, an aggrieved party needs to sue him in federal court.

Summary judgment will be granted and the federal judge will give him three options: (1) issue marriage licenses, (2) resign, or (3) go to jail for civil contempt. 




 You could use LEDs to allow for customization. 




 I live on the border and my experience has been very positive. A lot of older folks have passed away since 2000 and have been replaced by people who were no older than 3 at that time.

Just about eveyone I talk to agrees it is time to move on.

 Only because I knew Buffett has a cameo and I was on the lookout for him. 




 A federal judge could give her three options: (1) comply, (2) resign, or (3) be held in contempt and go to jail. 




 The Moto 360 uses wifi so I'm sure the Apple Watch will have it fairly soon. Cuts the tether to a large degree (at work/around the house). 




 And deaf. 




 How'd you pull off the tear?

Edit: Apart from Snoo-rape, of course. 




 Explain? I'm genuinely curious and to make that statement, you need to be intimately familiar with both of their personal ideologies. 




 ... ok. I don't disagree. That really just proves me point.

If you repeatedly hold yourself out as more pious than others, it's more damning when you act otherwise. 




 Is he wearing a skirt? 




 Liberals don't wrap themselves in religion like conservatives do. That's the difference. 




 Yes. 




 Because it's all bullshit. It's never been about protecting marriage; it's always been about not liking the homos. 









 They don't realize that sane people use the comment section of any online news article to pinpoint the batshit viewpoint.

They're doing progressives a favor. 




 Yep - happening to me, too. Curiously, it's only happening on my desktop - works fine on my Chromebook. 




 This is like "Air America".

The left doesn't do talk radio well, and the right doesn't do this well. 




 Are you suggesting that governments _don't_ request bids from private companies? 




 The owners of this station don't want to show it. Are you suggesting we somehow force them to? 




 You have no right to decide what a private company broadcasts. If YOU don't like this decision, change the channel. 




 I don't think that's what is happening.

I was born and raised - and live - in the Deep South (white Millennial). If I owned TVLand, I'd probably not like having it in my line up.

Is that because I'm scared of not being PC? No. It's just distasteful to me and I want no part of it. And as the owner of TVLand, well, it's my choice (and it's your choice to watch something else).

Go buy it on Google Play. 




 "More votes than _EVER_!" 









 Congratulations! You two need to go on a double date with the first gay couple in Richmond County, haha. 




 Columbia County is for money. Richmond County is for wealth (and the poor). 




 Trump is proof that having a lot of money only means you have a lot of money. 




 ... All three. 




 Damn straight. 




 Another big argument is unfounded wars.

Can't tell if that's a typo because they both work. 




 June is a common time for SCOTUS opinions. It's not a coincidence but it's not why. 




 As a gay attorney, I need that T-shirt.

Gimme. 




 He sounds like a commentor on my local newspaper... it's embarrassing for him. 




 Richmond County Courthouse on Walton Way.

Holy shit, y'all. :) 




 But isn't Scalia the source of the "benign neglect" quote when it comes to statutory construction?

I don't recall the specifics but I'm fairly certain it was an Administrative Law ruling from before he was on the SCOTUS. 




 Tomorrow is also the start of Stonewall Weekend.

 South Carolina... 














 Ask for the identity of the "trained member" who personally reviewed the complaint.

That should quickly resolve most bullshit. 




 I'm involved now, but can't say I would have been... 




 We are capable of addressing more than one issue at a time. One thing being extremely important doesn't make a very important thing unimportant. 














 "YOU tell _me_!" 




 Helluva time to find that out (for either person)... 




 Source unnecessary... that many abs don't get together all at once otherwise. 




 _Frodooooooo of the nine fingers...._ 




 Loser pays is an awful system that benefits the wealthy. If a person is harmed by the negligent or intentional acts of someone, but knows that they will be responsible for fees if they lose, that person will be much less likely to file suit. 




 Then why are you flying a flag?

If you know you're a proud... whatever, why do you care if other people know it? 




 In my experience, it's part of an SEO package. When an SEO company is hired, every attorney using that company recommends you. 




 ... I'm referring to the employee being imprisoned for violating parole by a few hours. 




 And Indiana. 




 Yep. I was born and raised in the South.

It's a traitor's flag. Nothing more. 




 For fuck's sake I hate this "be 100% perfect" mentality. Give the guy a break. 




 Ehhh.... Avvo is crap. Good ratings are essentially bought.

Google/Facebook reviews or plain old word of mouth are the best source for reviews.

Edit: I didn't downvote you /u/TheTatCat213. But I did get you back up to zero! 




 My thought was that the flow would slowly run down due to friction or whatever, but it would take a while. Adding a turbine would cause it to run down _much_ quicker.

In other words, it might appear to be perpetual motion device but really just slowly stopped.

Of course, "fake" is a much cleaner answer. 




 I'd like to take a peek into this judge's closet. People that bellow that loudly about "moral decay" are more often than not doing something pretty morally decadent.

Edit: Not that it is important, but we should all give each other a bit of a break. 




 Taqueria El Patron? 




 Major sexual tension is probably why. 




 Unworkable because it results in a contradiction. To enforce such a concept, the actual "freedom of speech" would have to be violated.

I'm on mobile so can't really flesh it out, but the discussion interests me. 




 Excellent example. 




 I'm with ya. I've dug into this private free speech right thing before and it always leads to absurd results.

I'd love to see an analysis of it though.  




 Do you have any examples of non-government freedom of speech? 




 Can you find any analysis of this private free speech principle? I've looked and haven't ever really found anything.

Personally, I don't think it exists (because it is unworkable). The public just assumes it does because of how important the well-known public free speech principle is.

I do agree that anyone who promises no censorship but then censors is hypocritical. But they didn't violate my freedom of speech.

I'd also like to point out that we're really talking about degree here. This site is already moderated and censored (no child porn).

Edit: As for questioning a private company that doesn't allow "free for all" free speech, I strongly disagree. Businesses are not public discourse vehicles. If my employees tried to debate the merits of slavery with my customers, I would likely fire them (with good reason). 




 So it isn't about anyone's freedom of speech then, right?

It's simply about a private company changing its policy. Appealing to "freedom of speech" just strikes me as an emotional appeal. 




 I question that because the public is mistaken about "freedom of speech" that that changes anything.

I would love to see someone flesh it out, because every time I do, it seems clearly unworkable to me. 




 Why does Reddit owe you or anyone else "freedom of speech"? Where does it end?

Do I owe you freedom of speech? If I invite you over and you tell my child he shouldn't be able to get married because he's gay, am I wronging you in some way by asking you to leave?

I would really like to read an analysis of this concept, because every time it comes up, it doesn't seem to be a valid concept (when analyzed thoroughly). 




 That's my point.

I'm really not aware of a concept of "free speech" apart from the public right. The government is supposed to get out of the debate so it can be freely had. And the point of all this is not to debate _per se_, it's for ideas to compete, and win or lose based on their merits (e.g., feeding babies = good, child rape = bad).

But when a private individual says "_X_ is wrong", it's no one's place to then force that individual to say otherwise. I'm gay but don't think I can go into Mike Huckabee's house and force him to give me a platform to advocate gay marriage. However, if he has opened his house up to debate (better analogy to Reddit), and then decides to close it - well, all we can do is leave.

But in both examples, no one's free speech has been violated. It just doesn't seem to be a concept that withstands scrutiny when invoked as between two private individuals.

Do you have a link to a treatise on non-public freedom of speech? I'm genuinely curious because this comes up every time a corporation does something that someone disagrees with (e.g., Chick-fil-A). 




 I didn't say anything about a new law.

What do you think is the proper recourse if the owners of Reddit choose to violate your private right to freedom of speech? 




 I don't think a "private" right of free speech makes sense as a concept.

How would that work? Is Reddit supposed to be prevented from banning FPH (and by whom)?

The marketplace of ideas isn't desirable simply to have concepts lobbed back and forth, it's desirable to discuss those concepts _and judge them_.

Edit: Can anyone link to an analysis of the "philosophical ideal" of a private right to freedom of speech?  




 That place is going to get sued into oblivion. 









 That was an interesting "ah ha" moment when someone pointed it out on reddit.

Many people who think it is a choice might actually be bisexual, so to them which sex they mate with *is* a choice. 




 This could be /r/bestof material. 




 You can't catch it, if he knocks it down. 




 It is less than unusual. 




 Can Facebook events without a date be created? 




 Hey /r/Augusta!

On the day the decision is released, supporters of gay marriage will gather for a rally outside of the Richmond County courthouse (Walton Way) between 4:30 PM and 7:00 PM.

The date is unknown but the time and place are being [coordinated](http://georgiaequality.org/issues/marriage-relationships/day-of-decision/) by Augusta Pride and Georgia Equality.

Come join us! 




 Holy shit. 




 It's ego stroking. 




 Given that the victim is trans, it is reasonable to look into the possibility that that was the motivation. 




 I think it's relevant to point out here that homosexuality used to "be" a mental illness. Given that, I am very skeptical of any argument against the trans community that uses similar justifications. 




 I find this whole discussion fascinating. I'm gay and fairly well involved with the local LGBT community but I've never drilled down into the trans community and its concerns to this degree.

I'm glad to see it is being well received by the public and media (overall). A lot of us have a lot to learn and that's easier when you're receptive. 




 We don't know it's not relevant. The police are still investigating. 




 I don't think all straight people would stop having sex were the punishment the same. 




  I'm actually super awesome now.

"Everything is awesome!" 




 Can you list a few legitimate arguments that are not based on religion? 









 He said jiffs. 




 I love being self-employed. 




 Ah, yes. I misunderstood who was trying to dodge liability. I wonder why the company wasn't named by the U.S. though... 




 The comment he's referencing doesn't make sense though. Naming Nike wouldn't have subjected the U.S. government to lawsuits by Nike "until proven". 




 If I recall correctly, legal pleadings are generally exempt from libel/slander. 




 I've been there and got out. This is solid advice.

In 5 years, it will be the best decision you ever made.

Edit: "Been there" = unhappy, not specifically the same or a similar situation. 




 It doesn't have to be a manipulative relationship. The working spouse may be willing to support a talent they also see (or at least think should be explored). 




 Well, it is offensive. If not being offensive is something you value, now you know how to approach this issue so as not to be offensive.

Again, it's not a big deal to make the mistake. But knowingly misgendering someone is. 




 Oh I don't disagree that she is more than a member of the transgender community. But it's offensive to refer to her as a him.

It's similar to refusing to refer to a gay spouse as "husband" because a husband is married to a wife (woman).

It's an understandable mistake given the nascency of the transgender movement. But knowing that it is offensive and refusing to adjust is not. 




 That's it! Thanks. Definitely makes my eyes glaze over when I run across it in the wild. 




 So I guess I have a few weeks of "by the each" to look forward to. 




 It looks like you can even see where the old curb was.
