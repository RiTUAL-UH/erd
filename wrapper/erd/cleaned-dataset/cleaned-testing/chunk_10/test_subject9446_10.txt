 Low hanging fruit man...low hanging fruit... 




 Sorry, you're right..should say "after Q3 earnings report" or something similar. My mistake :-/ 









 Probably a floor saf...I mean, nothing. It's probably nothing. 




 Ahhh, video game justice. 














 Yeah, I was wondering that myself. 




  144 deaths, 1,391 injuries and 8,061 device malfunctions were recorded out of a total of more than 1.7 million robotic procedures carried out between January 2000 and December 2013.

That's less than a 0.1% failure rate on robotic surgeries (factoring in deaths and injuries, but not device malfunctions). I'd be curious to learn what the comparable rate is for human surgeons. 









 I can't tell if I'm reading this in Arnold's voice or Jorgen Von Strangle from Fairly Odd Parents. 




 This post is half-baked.

I'll show myself out. 









 Here we go again... 




 Sad that this had to escalate this far before they would even acknowledge this... 




 Is this irony? Or is this one of the times when I get lambasted for not knowing the difference between irony and coincidence? 




 Love that movie. Such a great picture of a loving, long-term relationship... 




 Totally agree. A checklist makes you look to put people into a box, and then disqualify them if they don't fit. It's a good way to miss out on truly unique and special people... 




 I saw this article and it made me smile: https://www.avelist.com/list/how-do-you-know-theyre-the-one-16137. How and when did you know that your fiance/husband/wife was "the one"? Would love to hear stories. Was it gradual? A specific moment? Did they fit a pre-determined checklist? Was it logical or a feeling? 




 Yeah, I was always impressed with the career fairs and the number of big players in the tech/engineering space that were present. 














 Yeah, those are great suggestions, thanks! 




 Please feel free to comment here with your own suggestions and recommendations ! 









 Yeah, totally agree about the pillowcases. I've used the "sleeping on a hand towel" method with some success, but there's no substitute for clean, freshly washed pillowcase. 




 Recently came across this list (https://www.avelist.com/list/5-surprising-causes-of-adult-acne-and-inexpensive-solutions-18512), and while most of the items listed make sense to me, I was wondering if #1 was really an issue?

I talk on the phone for work a fair amount, and now I'm thinking that investing in a headset will not only help rest my arms/hands, but also help keep my face clear.

Curious to hear your thoughts/comments... 




 It's as if car alarms have taught us nothing about proper theft deterrent... 




 Careful, he might get clubbed on the head for comments like that. 




 That's super cute! We joke about making Toby stand next to the TV to improve our signal reception. 




 Yes. Inching my way slowly with my back to the wall. 




 Couldn't afford to lose him and Murray, we'll see if we can afford this price tag to keep Dez.  




 Haha, thanks! Doesn't matter how many times it falls out, it always grows back straight up :) 









 It also probably depends where in the US (or in the world) you live in. I'm a in a pet-friendly college town, so there's a lot less weight restrictions and plenty of single-floor/first-floor options. 




 Yeah, that's a fair assessment. I think most of those breeds do fall under or near 50 lbs, but it's definitely important to consider living situations (like you mentioned, stairs, etc.) :)

I would say this is just a starting point, not every dog here will be great in every situation...I think it's important to do a good bit of research on your intended dog type. 




 While your dismissive and critical tone doesn't warrant a gracious response, here are my thoughts anyway:

You're incorrect about the Boxers needs. It's generally recommended for Boxers to receive 45-60 minutes of exercise a day (more is always better of course). [[1]](http://www.allboxerinfo.com/boxer-dog-exercise) [[2]](http://www.atlantaboxerrescue.org/exercise.html)

I never said **all** of those breeds have **all** of those characteristics. It's a wide mix of dogs that in some way or another have some suitability for a young adult. I think the linked videos give a great breakdown of each breed, so you can learn about the tradeoffs there.

I never claimed to be an expert. If you're an expert, good for you, you're allowed to dissent. My recommendation would be to do so more cordially in the future. 




 While of course differing in looks/size, the breeds listed are similar in that they fit into some of the following categories: "friendly, easily trained, less vocal pooches with moderate activity needs".

Think of them as dogs that are lower down on the "maintenance requirements" list. I think the author's goal was to offer a widely varying selection of breeds :)
