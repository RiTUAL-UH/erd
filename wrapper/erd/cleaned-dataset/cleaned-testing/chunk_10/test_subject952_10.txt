 Sure... I can say that. It's *half* true 




 Lol 4 weeks 6 days 




 Secret Stage Podcast. "It's about a bunch of guys who talk about stuffy stuff that's very... Stuffy" - Zachary Davis founder of Secret Stage Productions 

(btw I was paid to say that) 




 Yes, every night. I normally just pick a new podcast and after a few days I'll go back to it and start over, and I forgot it all by then so it's like a new podcast. 




 I might actually make this right now, I don't how much ice cream I have left tho, or if it's vanilla 




 Would there still be lettuce/tomato/ketchup on it? If not, then HELL YESSSS!  




 Currently, an episode of Ear Bicuits by Rhett and Link from Good Mythical Morning 









 /r/destinythegame /r/fireteams are great subreddits, fireteams as an lfg subreddit and destinythegame as a discussion subreddit. My GT is Moreos, I'll add you in the morning :) 




 Cool. 




 :) 




 Np, btw girl here but it doesn't matter lol 




 Okay, I'm going to bed now. I will look at the albums in the morning :) 




 I will, definitely :) 




 I don't really listen to any of those people, but I'm sure you're music is great and will continue to get better as you practice :) 




 Nice! You are making much better use of your time than I am haha 




 Nice, I love video games and sleeping as well haha. I will look your music up! 




 Yaay 13 here! No body answers my amas so I'll answer yours.

What are your favorite things to do to pass the time?

Hobbies/interests?

Favorite color?

 




 You are thinking of Etheric Light, OP is talking about Treasure keys. 




 Shiarude- Leboufstorm 




 Cool, since the only thing he's interested in is PvP. Thanks for the info! 




 Quick question for my brother that does not have any of the DLCs. What's the highest level he can get to without access to Crota or PoE? He will only be in town for another month so he doesn't think its worth to buy the DLC.

 Oh.

I am looking for people to play with in PvP (I play all game modes) and/or teamates for ToO. Shoot me a message saying you're from Reddit, and we can play anytime :) 




 Haha  




 As a Camryn, meh 




 No. 




 That... That makes a lot of sense. 




 That sucks. What level are you? You on XBONE? I could take you through the raids if you like :) 




 Understandable. The guys in my team freaked when I got Hunger my first Crota run. 




 Yeah, I need to upgrade it 




 Congrats! I got my 3rd gally around 800 hours in. But I just got the SGA bounty last week! 




 Congrats man. I'm a no-lifer with over 1,000 hours logged and still never get a chance to do skolas, and I have a gally, too!  




 Well when I watch baseball and a player strikes out I can see them say fuck or something like that under their breath 




 Why the fuck are you reddit stalking me?  




 Lol I guess so.  




 Wasn't she underage tho.....? 




 I assumed the deer was already roadkill and they stumbled upon it, or if they were in the woods the deer was already injured or dead. But yeah, now that I think about it it's quite weird how that happens. 




 Glenn! 




 Sure thing 




 I mainly watch it because Barbie is hot lol 




 This is one of the only posts on here that actually made me go "what the FUCK?" Good job, OP. 




 I don't get it 




 It's good, very bloody lol.

They eventually leave the farm, imho it gets a lot better once they do that 

It's a good show, but you aren't really missing out. It's like, I would recommend it but there's other shows I would tell you to watch first.

Archer, Under the Dome

 Thanks! 




 I don't get it 




 Please stop. This has been reposted so many times this past week. 




 Wow these are beautiful! 




 I found Waldo! 




 Haha both me and my team started freaking out and screaming lol I had to set my controller down for a minute because I couldn't believe it! 




 These aren't anything too special, but I'm proud of them :)

Aaaaand those are some of the very few moments when I looked like I knew what I was doing! Hope you all enjoyed!


 




 It's okay. Thanks for the effort, it's much appreciated :) 




 :( nope  




 Aww that sucks.  




 Nope 




 I'm assuming it's not on Netflix yet? 




 K 




 Ahh well good luck out there guardian! 




 /r/antijokes 




 You can do it! I guess exotic restrictions are only for armor and weapons. 




 Thanks, I'll look into it later :) 




 Yes, but I will be on mobile for the next few days and it does not do that on Reddit Sync.

Thanks for the explanation! 




 That's a good question. I will test it in a few hours! 




 What level are you? If you are below 20, complete the story, do bounties, play some strikes. Just get a feel for the game and how it operates.

Once you get to above 20, now you grind strikes to get vanguard marks and level up your vanguard rank. Once you get to rank two, you probably have a full set of blue gear that makes you a higher level. You can also buy gear from the vanguard person to make your level even higher. 

We can talk again once you get to level 28-ish. If you have any more questions about the game, PM me and I will try my best to answer them. Also, if you have Xbox One, you can shoot me a friend request to play missions, do bounties, or play strikes/PvP. My GT is 'Moreos'
