 It's good to hear someone returned to "normal" fairly quick!

The one thing I love about BC is that I don't get many period symptoms. I started BC because of terrible cramps. Definitely not looking forward to that again. Ugh! And why must PMS and early pregnancy be so damn similar?! 




 Thank you! I'll definitely check out the book.  




 I went with my husband in May. I was really nervous because I have bad social anxiety as well. We were seated in a corner where there were only two other tables. Our waiter, "Uncle" Dale, was amazing. He was a nice older gentleman. He didn't do anything that made me feel uncomfortable. He never called us out on anything, though we watched our elbows and we ended up eating everything. He commented on our huge appetites. The other two tables kept him busy - both of the other families had really intricate allergies so he spent a lot of time talking to them about food options. Anyway, he provided a really positive experience, no public humiliation whatsoever. I definitely think they can tell how much you want to participate.  




 This is the best comment.  




 Agreed. We put it back in a little longer after I took a pic because we realized the dough wasn't completely done 




 I'll have to ask my husband if he has the recipe 




 One thing that's really bothering me right now is when to go off birth control. I've been on the pill since I was 15, so about 8 years now. For most of that time I was on a pill where I would only have like 3 periods a year. Last year I switch to Generess Fe and started having periods every month for the first time in a long, long time. My brand was just recently switched to Layolis Fe.

I really want to go off BC because I want to start tracking my cycle. I don't know why, but I have a HUGE fear that my cycles won't be regular. I also think my BC is giving me acne - I started getting cystic acne when I switched pills last year, and my acne flares the same time every month (the second week on active pills, which seems odd?). I'm also curious if going off the pill will help my headaches. 

Obviously there are also reasons to stay on the pill though. For one, my prescription is free. I used to pay $25 a month, but as of a few months ago it's now free. If I go off the pill, we'd have to pay for condoms or we'd have to be super careful about preventing. Also, what if by some sheer luck get pregnant right away? I mean, I'd be super excited, but I'd really prefer to keep waiting until we're closing to having a house. 

Ugh. It's such a complicated decision!
 
So, how did you decide when to go off the pill? Are you waiting until you're ready to start trying? Or did you go off a bit early to start tracking? Also, is anyone willing to share their experience going off pill? 

Help me stop worrying about ovulating after going off the pill! 




 There's tomato buried somewhere under all that cheese... 









 Don't do it! I spent two hours on there one night just looking at baby items. It's addicting.  




  When has he ever been sickly and weak? Just because he lost a fight as a 15 year old boy to a 20 year old man? Because he's not built?
 

There is indication he was a small, weak, sickly boy. Littlefinger sees himself as a weak boy from a small family who ended up becoming powerful. Also, remember S4E8 when Littlefinger says "Sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men"? He wasn't just talking about Robin; he was referring to himself. 




 Mind absolutely blown. 




 Haha sorry I went overboard! I'm happy to help.  




 (oh crapthis ending up being SUPER FREAKING LONG. But I hope its somewhat useful)

Oh man, I love this topic! I cannot stop obsessing over finances. I've only been looking at the first year though, so many someone else can help with the rest. Oh, please keep in mind that Im not a financial person, Im just a normal woman who loves researching the shit out of finances. So take what I have to say with a grain of salt.

First off, stay away from personal finance. Some people there can be ruthless. I once saw a pregnant woman seek advice there for an unexpected baby and they all told her to get an abortion. WTF?

In 2010, the USDA estimated that the average middle-income family spends $12,000 in the first year of a baby's life. Yikes! But it's so tough to calculate the exact cost of a baby because it varies from person to person. 

[Here is a lovely baby cost calculator to help you figure out about how much you'll need for your baby's first year](http://www.babycenter.com/baby-cost-calculator).

I think one of the biggest reasons that number is so high is because of child care. It can be ridiculously expensive, and the younger the child the more expensive it is. For many people it seems most of their monthly income goes toward childcare. I've seen numbers as high as $2,000 a month (the fuck?!), but it depends on where you live. If you plan to use daycare, maybe look online, call around, or ask around to see what typical costs are in your specific area. Obviously, if you do not use daycare of whatever, you're going to save a ton of money right off the bat. 

The cost will also vary depending on whether you chose cloth diapers vs disposible. Someone over on BabyBumps just put together a [wonderful chart that compares the prices of diapers](http://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj513/elfer1/2015-07-14%2011_39_47-Diaper%20Comparison%20-%20Google%20Sheets_zpszpzwha9e.png). 

There are estimates out there on how many diapers a baby goes through the first year. [ToysRUs has a chart on their website](http://www.toysrus.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=10872434) that breaks down numbers. Estimates show you'll need about 2,788 disposible diapers for the first year, which costs about $550, based on paying an average of $.20 per diaper. For wipes, I've read it's best to buy bulk. People have suggested to never pay more than $.02 per individual wipe. 

I personally dont plan on cloth diapering, but it can save a TON. I have read that it costs about $381 to cloth diaper a child from birth to potty training. In comparison, it can cost $2,500 for disposable diapers from birth to potty training. Cloth diapering is especially useful if you plan on having more than one child. You buy all the cloth diapers for your first child and you can reuse the diapers for the second. [Here is a website that shows the price differences on cloth diapers]( http://www.diaperdecisions.com/pages/cost_of_cloth_diapers.php).

Formula... I cannot gauge prices on formula because it depends on what baby can tolerate. I've seen prices as cheap as $50 a month to formula feed, but I've also seen people pay ridiculous amounts (like $500 a month) because baby is allergic to things and needs a very special formula. Ugh. Breastfeeding can obviously save you a ton of money.


Hospital costs   doctors visits can be factors too I guess - will your insurance pay for most everything or are you going to have to foot a lot of the bill? Ive seen couples pay nothing out of pocket for the entire pregnancy + birth, and Ive seen couples pay $10,000 just for the birth. I recommend contacting your insurance in advance of pregnancy and see what all they cover so you know what you can expect to pay.

Then it depends what you want to buy for baby. Do you really have to buy all the toys for your baby? For some, an empty formula can will provide hours of entertainment and saves you money on toys. 

Does everything have to be brand new or are you okay with used and hand-me-downs? You can save a ton of money buying used. Some people buy things they end up not using and instead of returning them they just put the items on Craigslist or whatever  allowing you to buy things basically brand new at a much cheaper price. You know those mamaRoos that cost $200 brand new? You can find them on Craigslist almost brand new for under $100!


Anyway, the USDA says I'll spend $12,000 on our baby...but I'm calculating that we shouldn't need more than $5,000 for the first year (and even that sounds a bit high). The point is that the cost is different for every family. 




 You're not a downer. I didn't think about that before. Your comment is actually eye-opening and I like the brutal honesty. I know I need to work on actually making changes instead of just pushing through, and I'm honestly trying. I tried to get professional help in the past and it failed, which absolutely crushed me. I'm finally starting to find the courage again to try to learn how to actually overcome anxiety. 

In short, thank you for reminding me that "just pushing through" isn't enough. 




 I'm a long time lurker, never really introduced myself. I'm a 23-year-old female. I've been struggling with anxiety since my early teenage years, but it seems to have gotten worse since sustaining a concussion. Now a days it seems to manifest physically (headaches, neck pain, stomach pain/IBS, dizziness, lightheadedness, hot flashes, all that jazz). I am extremely on edge whenever I go out, so I like to hide away in my apartment, where I just sit around and dread my next social interaction.

Anyway... I currently volunteer with an animal rescue group by writing adoption biographies of the animals and posting them online, which in and of itself makes me nervous as hell. Last night though, the woman in charge forwarded an adoption application and asked me to contact the 3 references and interview them. Calling 3 strangers and actually talking to them? INSTANT PANIC!!! I've been dreading it for the last 12+ hours, but I finally forced myself to sit down and call the references. Happily, I executed the interviews without sounding like a complete idiot. 

I feel so stupid for being proud of myself for doing something as "simple" as calling people. More than anything, I'm proud that I'm finally trying to conquer my anxiety. This is a huge accomplishment.  




 Second this. I'm 23, been married for 2 years, still on parents insurance since it's currently the best option.  




 DH bet me yesterday that I can't go a whole day without talking about babies. It's not going so well :( 




 Congrats!

 I have chronic daily headaches and get migraines as well. I also have terrible anxiety. Magnesium seems to help people with migraines, depression, and anxiety so I've added a magnesium supplement to my diet. I feel like my headaches are less severe now a days. It could possibly help with bipolar disorder too. Maybe ask your doctor if it's worth a try.  




 How exciting! My college professor is a contributing writer. 




 Today, DH and I were texting while he was at work. Out of the blue, he sent me a link to a gun he was looking at (no surprise; he's always looking at guns or hunting stuff). In reply, I sent him a picture of [this onesie](http://i.imgur.com/sJPHyk8.jpg) one of the local hospitals is giving to babies born during the MLB All Star Week. Guess which one of us has baby rabies?
