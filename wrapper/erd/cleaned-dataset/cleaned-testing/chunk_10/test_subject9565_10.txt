 His career has been in the tanks for years now.  




 I just came home from work and a neighbour that I never met before  wanted to speak with me. He asked where has my father been because he noticed that he hasn't seen him in a while. My father died 7 months today from a four year battle with pancreatic cancer. This is the first time when someone asked where my father was and wasn't aware of his passing. It's a really horrible feeling, I've been dealing with his loss in a healthy way (getting help , finding hobbies etc), but it made me miss my dad more. The neighbour though told me when he first moved onto the street, my dad was one of the first people to greet him, it made me smile. Sometimes, curses can turn into blessings!  




 I'm so sorry for your loss. I just lost my father last December and my stupid cousin was on snap chat while we were at the cemetery and apparently took a picture. There are a lot of shmucks (idiots) out there. Since my dad's passing, I realized who were my friends and who arent. I stopped being in touch with one friend because she wouldn't seek help with her fathers death and kept on guilt tripping people and wanted attention. You are upset and honestly it's not worth it. Focus on yourself and you should find yourself new friends   




 You are in high school, you have your whole life ahead of you. Your age, you start to have your first relationships etc. He is 34 years old, his age get married or start popping out babies by then. What do you guys even have in common besides being both humans and both sexual attracted to each other? Nothing. 18 years different has been done before but it's different when ones in high school and the other one is almost two decades older. 


YOU CAN DO BETTER 




 From a Jew to that co-worker: SHMUCK  




 I agree theres a lot of plot holes, I just binged watched this show in 3 days and now I have to wait till 2016. Okay so I find Lexa/Clarke kiss so fucking random. Maybe I was still on season 1 and I went on youtube to be told that Finn dies and she hooks up with Lexa. I'm not against it because its a same-sex kiss, I just think its so random or its' just me 




 She has the right to know, it is her decision to decide not yours.  




 NOPE, its normal  




 You shouldn't date anyone that you will be only attracted to if they change. Won't work and will make you look like a dick.  









 Dump them both  




 People judge without knowing what's it like. They assume they know everything when actually they do not.  




 I recently went through a similar thing. My friend lost her father suddenly and is not grieving in a healthy way. She's more interested in getting a boyfriend than getting help. I stopped being friends with her because i lost my father just a few months after to cancer. She freaked out on my friend because she told her she needed help because every time the word heart or attack came up she would bring it up that it reminded her of dads death so  i knew i had to get away. You can only do so much 




 Your relationship with your mom is not healthy. Your mother bullies you and it affects you emotionally. Honestly, I would remove contact from your mom because she's really toxic.  




 SAY NO
 




 Pancreatic cancer sucks. My dad died recently from a 4 year battle. 

Live your life till the fullest. This is YOUR time to do whatever you wished to do.  




 My father was diagonsed cancer 4 years ago and recently passed away. It sucks, but cherish every memory you have with him.  Focus on yourself as well.  It's a lot to handle, I'm 21 years old and so many of my friends fathers are well and healthy.  You need to be there for your family and your father  but most importantly you 




 :) 




 Honestly, it doesn't matter what they think. It matters the freindship you have plus I'm speaking for myself but I would think that's a bonus since I also have a gay friend and knowing that the person isn't homophobic is a plus.  




 750 dollars! That's her mistake, she needs to be more careful.  




 wireless headphones i think would be the best option  




 It won't work out.  




 Block her everywhere and if she comes again call the police.
You may have to order an restraining order against her  




 2 months, and she wants you to spend $7,500. I think she wants to move a little too fast  




 Death is apart of life, everything eventually dies from plants, animals and humans. No one knows what to say until they are the ones experiencing it.  Everyone deals with it eventually, but unfortunately, some deal with death earlier than others. My father died recently on December 8, 2014 from a 4 year battle with pancreatic cancer. Besides my father being diagnosed with cancer 4 years ago in 2010, this was also the hardest day of my life. But, I can sit and cry for years on how my dad was taken away from me at the age of 21 and how he won't be there for my birthdays or my graduation in 2 years or if I walk down the aisle. My father was the one who cheered me on with school, went on ski trips with, bought technology with (phones, printers) and went to Tim Hortons so he could visit a camping store nearby. My father wasn't my best friend, but he was my mentor who I looked up to and who was my light to my darkness. I've been battling depression for a year now and it's hard, but knowing my father would want me to continue my life as it was before he died and succeed. I want to make my father proud and I will.  




 I'm a student and things spread like wild fire. It doesn't look good if it comes out that you are sleeping with a student and you slept with more than one. Hope its worth it.  




 I don't know if this is serious or not, but your reputation is at risk. You'll be known as the teacher that sleeps with the students and not for being a good teacher. Be smart  




 I think it will also bomb because it was supposed to be released earlier and there was so much hype about it and now it was pushed back to 2015 people are more interested in 50 shades of grey and Oscar noms  




 I'm very sorry, I recently just lost my father after a 4 year battle with cancer. It is not easy what you are going through, its mentally, emotionally exhausting. Every day I wish my father would walk through the door because my dad was always a fighter and when he passed it still hasn't hit me. I know that he is in a better place because seeing him in the hospital unconscious killed me. You need to associate yourself with people who will be there for you. This will be a time where you see who your real friends are. I would also recommend you see a professional, although you may think you don't need it. There's nothing wrong expressing your feelings to a professional. I like my social worker, she tells me I'm awesome. 

Keep your head up high 

It's hard I know, but you are not facing this alone  




 I'm still a virgin too and I'm 21 years old turning 22.  I mean I could go on tinder and loose it anytime but I'm not that kind of girl. There's nothing wrong with that  




 Clint Eastwood 
I would say he's work is all over the place in my opinion. He has some great films such as Million Dollar Baby, The Changeling, but then he has like Hereafter and Jersey Boys 




 Thank you, I'm currently seeing a social worker. 




 Oscars/Emmys/Golden Globe do make a difference.
Because they are referred as  for example ''oscar nominee/winner___'' when the person comes on stage to present an award or to announce the person before the interview starts. 

Also if the person has been nominated, they use it in trailers  




 If you could bring back any previous guest who would it be? 




 I hate to say this but KARMA!!!

A) You gave tons of money to some person who you don't even know 
B) You cheated on your wife 

Sorry pal but you deserved it

 




 It's nice that he cares about his brother, but he's out of line completely and does not understand it.  




 Okay if someone was posting online how big my boobs are, I'll dump that asshole. My boobs are only for me and whoever im seeing.  




 Don't message the girl, she's not worth your time neither is your asshole soon to be ex husband. He was the one who was supposed to be committed to you.  




 Yes and no
I'm happy indie movies are being recognized 
but im not happy with the lack of diversity  




 She is thirty and has been married 3 times.  She should pay for her own. Look I may be 21 years old but there comes to a certain age where a parent does not pay the bills for the child. She's taking advantage of you and you and your husband need to put your foot down  




 She shouldn't be putting rules down, that she can't follow as well.  




 Honestly, he said he would drive you and you said that this has happened before. He isn't worth your time.  




 Im sitting in class listening to my professor repeatedly say mental health problems and this is not the first time I disagreed with a teacher's choice of words. I have a hearing loss and instead of the teacher saying that I have a hearing loss, she decided to use my least favourite words hearing problems.  Im trying so hard not to raise my hand as well as to rebuttal the topic. I have depression and anxiety which makes my life sometimes a little bit complicated, but I do not see it as a problem. There is a lot of stigma revolving mental health and as for someone who is trying to educate us, using problem and mental health in the same sentence is doing more harm than good. A problem is defined as something to fix and mental health cannot be fixed. There is medication as well as therapies to help assist with mental health to make it easier for the person, but it doesnt always help. The reason Im writing this is because mental health is not a problem and by saying that makes it seem that I as well as the many others have something that needs to be taken away. The topic Mental Health has been brought up in many conversations, advertisements and media outlets, but there needs to be a CHANGE on how WE talk about mental health.  




 Sorry your sister had to witnessed that.  




 Sorry i barely read it.
