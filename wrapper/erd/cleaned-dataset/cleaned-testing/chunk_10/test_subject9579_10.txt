 I was with you up until you texted Betty.

She's obviously a shit head and Adam is a giant douche canoe but the baby didn't do anything to you, you shouldn't wish difficulty upon it (and honestly with parents like them it's going to have enough difficulty, I'm sure)

Other than that I think you are justified in your reaction and plan. I say go over to the house, get EVERYTHING out of there that you might want (jewelry, Mrs Snuffles, etc) and plan on never going back. Don't give Claire any money for the baby shower/gift. She and the rest of them can figure that out. 

And don't text Betty again, block her number/email/Facebook. Do it to Adam as well and throw your mom in while you're at it. I would totally and forever cut Betty and Adam out of your life and only consider talking to your mom again if she apologizes and seems to understand why what she did was COMPLETELY fucked up. 

Good luck.  




 So I'm single again for the first time in about 12 years. 

I'm trying to put myself out there again and I've arranged a date for Thursday. 

I'm excited but pretty nervous. I haven't asked a girl out in forever (I'm pretty stoked she said yes) and I want things to go well. 

I need some advice:  

I was planning on taking her to play some Mini-golf and then maybe get some dinner after if things go well. I wanted something fun and not a cliche (though I do love dinner and a movie) and I thought this set up would allow for good chances at conversation. 

Is this a good idea? Should I stick with something more traditional?  Also, should I bring flowers or is that too corny?

Tldr:  I'm going on a first date with a new girl after my divorce. HELP!! 




 Definitely do not 'suck it up' until the fall. You need to be clear with him that he is still responsible for certain things. 

With him making money (for now) and you doing the majority of the chores things seem pretty balanced from an outsider's perspective. But if either of you aren't happy with the arrangement then they aren't balanced. 

You guys need to have a discussion and both lay out what the arrangement will be and if there is a discrepancy between your individual expectations then a compromise must be agreed upon. 

That is the way you avoid resentment. 

Honestly, if I were him I would be happy to only have to take out the trash. 

Oh, and the dishes thing I feel like shouldn't even be negotiated. That's just a thing that adults do, they clear their fucking plates. C'mon guy, seriously.  




 You sound like a very caring and sensitive person and I can understand why you would be upset by her actions. That being said you should listen to your fianc and (future) FIL; this is not your fault. 

You should have a talk with your fianc and tell him that you're removing his mom from Facebook. Also, I would suggest setting a precedent now about dealing with family drama: he deals with his family, you deal with yours. 

You don't owe her an apology or explanation. If something needs to be said, let him do it. Though he shouldn't be apologizing either, only saying that her actions are not acceptable. 

As far as the trip/honeymoon, for now I would assume that they aren't happening. That sucks but if you plan for them to not happen (ie, start saving/planning for one you can afford) then it will be a pleasant surprise if his family comes through. If not, well, then you're no worse off.

On another note, your fianc sounds like a good guy and that he knows you very well. 

Good luck.  




 Maybe getting him excited beforehand would work. 

Send him some sexy texts/pictures, tell him you want to have sex later, let him know that you're excited about it. 

You mentioned that you're afraid of him just going along with you because you want it and he won't really be into it. I suggest getting him started and he WILL be into it. 

Also, getting him excited and anticipating might make him more willing.  




 Got mine yesterday! 




 Suspicious because I would wonder what caused her sudden change and I don't know that I would automatically believe her explanation. I find that this level of self awareness is rare in people and I would be expecting every minute for her to start treating me like shit again. 

I am not your husband but I can tell you that after years of living with a verbally abusive (and just plain mean sometimes) person that my desire to open up and trust her with my feelings was pretty dang low. 

Your husband is probably hesitant to do the same because he doesn't want to be hurt any more. He has learned to live with the old you in a way that keeps him safe, he has to get used to the new you.  He needs to learn to trust you with his feelings and that's probably going to take some time. 

I really hope you guys can make it work. 
 




 Of course you're sad. You can't trust the man you love and that SUCKS!

The best thing for you to do is to call it off with him and cut all contact. He's proven that he doesn't want a monogamous relationship with you and that he can't be trusted. 

Yeah, he says he does, maybe he even thinks this is what he wants but his actions say otherwise. And actions count. Talk is cheap, as they say. 

You deserve someone who you can trust and will be honest with you. I know you can find that, it's just not this guy, I'm sorry. 

Good luck.  




 So, number 1, if this is bothering you then you need to talk to him about it. It's unlikely to resolve itself. 

But beyond that I don't know that I would automatically assume he's some kind of creep based on the info you've given. 

He likes Asian women, that is clear, but is it a bad thing to have a preference?  I'd say as long as your preference doesn't come from some racist viewpoint then it's ok. 

All of his GFs have been younger, ok. It is weird that they've all been 7 years younger but that could just be a coincidence. I would be more concerned if he was always going after girls that were of a certain age (like he only dates 24 year olds), that would be weirder to me. 

Maybe he is connecting with younger women on a maturity level. 

The point is, I would try not to assume the worst about him and have a conversation about his dating past. Don't be accusatory, just ask. 




 You sound a lot like my (soon to be ex) wife. Except the part about realizing your mistakes, my wife never did that. 

If my wife had done that though, and suddenly changed her behavior, I would have been supremely suspicious but also be waiting for her to go back to how things were. 

I think everyone else has already given some good advice: couples therapy, make clear your realization and intentions, don't backslide. 

Good luck.  




 Tell your husband he has two choices: either his mother leaves or you (and your son) leave. 

Accept no other options. She is toxic both for your son and for your marriage. 

Good luck.  




 I understand and it's not like you can totally cut her off since you have your son in common. 

I'd say, for now, continue your policy of only accepting calls about your son while Sarah is around. In fact, if you haven't already, let your ex know that is what is going on. 

For the record, in no way am I saying you should start being unfriendly to your ex, but, you can have a cordial and healthy relationship with her without sharing every detail of your life. That's just something you have to decide for yourself. 

Good luck.  




 It's great that you have a friendly relationship with you ex, I'm sure it's very beneficial to your son. 

That being said, it sounds like you have a choice to make. Do you want to continue your relationship with Sarah or do you want to have the same level of friendly relationship with your ex?  It sounds like you can't do both. I don't think there's really a wrong answer to the question but you have to decide. 

Sarah obviously has some insecurities involving you and your ex and I don't think she will ever be comfortable with the relationship as it stands. She wants to feel more important to you than your ex and she can't do that while you're sharing a LOT of info about your life (things not related to your son). Maybe she's off base with her feelings and she probably needs to explore them more on her own but it's pretty clear that no matter the reason why, this is how she feels. 

So, if you want to continue with Sarah I think you're going to have to dial back the friendship with your ex. Limit your conversations to just child-related issues. 

If you are 100% unwilling to do that then you need to tell Sarah that things aren't going to change in that regard and she can either accept that or leave. My feeling is that she will leave.  




 I'm pretty used to it. My cleric was the first character I got to 60 so now if I kill anything faster than that it seems really quick. I guess if I had a TR for my benchmark it'd be a little different.  




 I play a heal/buff cleric and soloing things takes forever because I'm not set up to do damage. That's just how it is. 

On the plus side, I don't die, it just takes awhile. 

Soloing I run Chains Of Blazing Light, Daunting Light and Divine Glow. Triple Divinity casting Daunting Light followed by a fully empowered Daunting Light will take an impressive chunk out of most things your going to run into solo.

If you want me to run through in more detail add me on XBox (GT: Jaird) and I'll be happy to help you out.  




 You need to tell your husband what you've realized about yourself and what you want to change. Let him know how you feel about him. 

Also, know that while you have your own issues to deal with (and individual therapy is definitely warranted) it sounds like you guys have some interpersonal issues as well that would benefit from some couples therapy.

Talk to him about it, look into it.

Above all, stop holding everything in. It's not weakness to need help from others.
