 I think She was implying that Harry was nothing but a father to them. You know, same as if your dad was Tom Brady, Derek Jeter, or Will Ferrell. He's just dad, not an icon. 




   Why does it matter that Moody turned Malfoy into a ferret once?

Not to be a ballbuster, but Barty Jr. 




 Good one, my favorite snake. 




 They won't be remade. Won't! Won't! Won't! 




 Been at it almost 15 years.
 




 If your girlfriend has a really annoying friend, don't tell her how bothersome she is or to stop being friends with her. Just casually mention how attractive she is. 




 I think /u/b_w was referring to the fact that Neville just picked up the sorting hat and dusted it off. It was never put on Neville's head and set afire. 




 Cheers!

Eraserhead blew my mind. 




 [Here's](https://youtu.be/wOvsmAngDuM) a non-clickbait version. 




 It's not actually book canon that Draco ever was branded. 




 Like lollipops to him... 




 Hmmm... possibly not. Perhaps Fenrir was just paid in gold. 




 I like to get good and high first, and then have a shower beer after. 




 Voldemort used Fenrir as someone to do his dirty work, an enforcer, if you will and never gave him the mark.

I would assume it was only for his most trusted/loyal servants. 




 Rarely dry. In fact, I think it's been about six months since my last drought.

 I have his diving watch too. 




 While Snape has his moments. I would vote for Lupin. He was just a cool guy, and he reminds me of a teacher I had in HS. 




 It had a busted hinge, so I sent it for repair. Just got it back from PA good as new, except for the spots he wore the chrome off. This lighter has been around the world twice. 



















 The gleam of triumph was because Harry told Albus that Riddle had taken his blood in the graveyard, meaning Harry couldn't die while riddle was alive. I guess that's what you are saying?

Although it was still a suspicion. I think the silver thing just confirmed it.  




 Makes you wonder if Severus knew why he was keeping his eyes closed. 




 Remember the silver trinket with the two snakes? "But in essence divided?" That was when Albus knew for certain. 




 That's what Harry says, but it really comes down to the Elder wand not showing it's allegiance to Voldemort. 




 Albus did not discover Harry was a horcrux until OotP after Harry saw Arthur being attacked. Not to say he didn't have his suspicions before that though... 




 I like and appreciate the audiobooks, but I can read them much faster. 




 That was the one! 




 Other people have thought, like me, that Dumbledore actually bought the house, and kept Frank on as caretaker. That seems a very Dumbledory thing to do. 




 After HBP I thought Dumbledore wasn't dead. There were clues, and even a pretty convincing website that had collected every possible theory proving he was still alive. 




 That's funny. 









 Yep, exactly this. I has to do with intent. Like Hermione in GOF, she couldn't have freed the Hogwarts' elves even if she tried because she wasn't their master. That's why I think SPEW was a horrible page filler. 




 Yes, it's rare, but there are muggleborns in Slytherin. Scabior says as much in DH. 




 I'm not sure that's canon, but seems legit. 




 interesting... 




 Right.... 




 why was their vault higher (in Gringott's) than the Black's vault, or vault 713 even? 




 Right? I think The Donald is just about the biggest troll in history. If he isn't. I will still start the slow-clap.

 *Will and Won't* 




 Thanks. 




 Well TIL, thanks. 




 I think we're going to the one in Milford. 




 I love that Colin Hay was included in that scene. 




 I had not heard that theory before. 




 Can you elaborate on Slytherin represented by water?  




 I have that one, campaign trail. I plan on reading it after Hell's Angels. 

Edit: I have read F L in Vegas, Rum Diary, and Better Than Sex. 




 This is why Voldemort used Lucius' wand in the battle of the seven potters. He thought because they shared a common core it was defective. 




 If you think about it, per an earlier post about the common rooms, The dungeons are cold and not really a place for a snake to be active. I understand how something as large as a basilisk could hibernate in the chamber. It's cold, and snakes sleep when it's cold.

I also understand that the students aren't snakes, but the Ravenclaws were in an aerie(tower), Gryffin(dors) a tower also, Hullfepuffs(badger) were a bit below like a den. Do snakes really sleep that far underground?

**totally unrelated:**
I was watching the 1973 Disney version of Robin Hood today, and Friar Tuck is a badger, so was the Fat Friar. When they showed reward posters for Robin Hood, it was paid in **ingotts.** 




 I don't mean the fuckin shithole either, I'm talking about Trinity's baby. 




 For sure. He wasn't about to lose his life for journalism no matter how much he hated it. When shit got real he does what most civilians would have done.
 









 Oh, I've never liked horses. 




 That ass has a tail in front of it.
 




 Pics or it didn't happen. 




 I think Ron was in love with your butt. ;oP 




 I know I have depressions in the winter. It's like I'm in a three month funk.
 




 I find his earlier stuff too drawn out and tedious. I'm reading Hell's Angels now. His later writings seem to flow more and have a esy read to them. Rum Diaries, F L, for example. 




 But it just so happened to be a terrier, which chase otters (Hermione's patronus). 




 What is LPT?
 




 There are also fireplaces in the classrooms. We see students wearing gloves, scarves, and even balaclavas in the halls during the winter. For me that's how it should be done. It's a 'suck-it-up-and-move-on-with-your-life' type thing. 




 I've never been, I just assumed that since there are so many English speaking countries, that that's how the films would be. 




 I believe Albus assumed the Dursleys would explain everything to Harry that he left in his letter, but they didn't do that. 




 Really? 




 That's right, my bad. 




  Yes, they'll all be in European. But you should be able to turn on the English subtitles.

English is the main language in Europe. 




 It depends on what you offer them. The ministry only offered them broken souls in Azkaban. Voldemort offered them free reign. 




 I believe OP is referring to the Pottermore stories, and If I'm not mistaken, those can be found in a pdf in a link in the sidebar. 




 That's what you do on the toilet. 




 Color me green. 



















 The Boxer shuts up when I tell him too, but the little yapper has no on/off switch. All I can do is pick him up and hold his muzzle. I'm not cruel enough to buy a bark collar. Dogs are supposed to bark. 




 He barks when someone comes to the door. They only thing I can do is pick him up and hold his mouth shut. I am an actual dog owner, and a damn good one at that. 




 This is an old Hank Williams song he covered for an anthology. I've seen it live twice. 




 Yes. The students were already being evacuated, weren't they? 









 You try chasing a four legged animal about six feet shorter than you are.

I have had dogs all my life thank you very much, and I know how to train them. Roger is a rescue, and a parvo survivor. There isn't shit we can do about his barking. 




 Cheers.
 




 9/10? Maybe not the defenders of the bars and stripes. 









 /r/tokespot? 









 If you read the book, Albus tells harry before he drinks the potion, to use fire. Harry was more than capable to use that spell, but he was panicking, and forgot. 




 But Harry didn't die because Lily's blood sacrifice was inside Voldemort keeping Harry alive, not because he united the Hallows. 




  Its just way too long doing nothing.

I think that's what She was trying to convey here, hence all the angst and arguing. Like Harry says something to the effect of, Did you think we would be finding a horcrux every other day? She was trying to show that it wasn't just a cakewalk. 




 Haha, we live in a house and the neighbors hate him. 









 Cheers. 




 Wormtail, desperate to curry favour, salvaged it from the place it had fallen and carried it to him. I admit that would have been a bit of a feat for a rat, but they are highly intelligent creatures!

 Thank you! 




 People that perpetuate wrong ideas, such as Harry was a horcrux, therefore the Dursleys were evil people because of it. 




  also they are considered as intelligent

Crabbe and Goyle? 




 Harry was not a proper horcrux, as those require an incantation before. 









 Two more weeks and I will be there. I'm starting to get anxious. 




 I love to learn. All. The. Damn. Time. 

If I'm not reading or investigating something to find out about something I didn't know, I feel the time is wasted. 




 She said that Wormtail got it from the wreckage that night and kept it safe for Riddle. 




 Oh, I'm not nearly as clued in as that. I think I need to read the FAQ.
 




 I think I'm good for a while.  *puts the pipe down*
 














 ..ere
 




 Good eye, cheers. 














 I've had her at 14 for almost two years now. 




 I don't remember Draco taking the unbreakable vow. Is that indicated in the text? 




 Someone else mentioned 20 minute flight deck missions. I have a full deck with all level 4 jets, and I just send them once a day or every 24 hours. 









 I'm going on four years, and I think I've finally got the hang of it. I only have less than half of the heroes, but they are all leveled up. 









 I think I have found one of the oldest redditors. 




 Chillin' with the weasel buu.. dy! 




 Louis CK rocks it.
