 Republic Wireless can run off your WiFi. Not great for out on the road, but at least you can get calls at home. 




 How about the period from the end of WWII to the beginning of the Korean War, say 1946-1950?

I could see that being an interesting show. Kind of The Best Years Of Our Lives: The Series. 




 I love this show. Jack Black and Aasif Mandvi have great chemistry as a comedy duo and Robbins has been killing it as the Clintonesque, oversexed, wheeler dealer, Secretary of State.

 So, the lessons here are as follows. 

1) No matter how beloved your franchise is, if you make a bad movie, people aren't going to line up around the block to see it.

2) Just because your movie makes an unexpected load of cash, that doesn't mean it rates a sequel. 




 It still made a very nice return for its small budget.  









 If anyone is interested, a misheard or misinterpreted lyric is called a mondegreen. 

For some reason, these always make me laugh and so I'm sitting here at work, quietly chuckling to myself as I read though the linked thread. 









 Either [Harry Tracy: Desperado](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084052/) or [Radioactive Dreams](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091818/)

 









 The show was so slow that at times it seemed to be almost plotless. I half think that Simon made it as an experiment to see if he could put out a show where almost nothing happens and see if anyone would watch it.

 I loved the show. I loved the characters. I loved the music. I was tremendously sad when it was cancelled. 

But I don't think I ever said, "I wonder what happens on Treme tonight" because I really didn't care what happened. I just wanted to pop open a beer and spend an hour with Antoine Batiste, Albert Lambreaux and the rest of the gang. 

I lot of people have problems with a show like that, so they didn't watch it.

 









 Hey, you're the one who made the incorrect statements about "here in the USA" and what the minimum wage is. I just corrected you. 

HTH HAND 




 Federal minimum wage is $7.25/hour. Some states are higher. 




 That's the law. You can't  make deductions for things that benefit the employer, which include uniforms, tools, register shortages and such like if such deductions would reduce the employees pay rate below minimum wage.

http://www.wagehourinsights.com/minimum-wage/collecting-debts-from-employees/

If a minimum wage employee screws up, you're free to fire them, but you have to cover those losses out of your own pocket.

 




 That's not true. It is absolutely illegal for any employer in the US to make deductions from your pay that would reduce your rate below minimum wage. 

 Some states have stronger protections for wage deductions. 




 Nope, never again. 

Think about the MASH finale. 125 million people watched that show. over 60% of all households in the US were tuned in. If there was an apotheosis for the mass media, that was it.  

Remember, that was in the days of three broadcast networks and very little else of note. Cable was in its infancy. The VCR was just starting to catch on. If you weren't watching one of the big three, you were probably watching old movies or re-runs.

The only thing that compares to that now is the Superbowl.

 

The viewing landscape becomes more
 




 After Hours (1985) 









 I remember Lacey when she was on Party Of Five. I thought she might be the breakout star from that show. Oh wel. 




 I'm sure their money spends just as well as money from a more prestigious projects and I'd be willing to be this was a pretty quick shoot.

I love Tobo, but I'm sure he's not in a position to turn down a lot of work. 




 Morgan Fairchild, what the hell did you do to your face? 
























 JSTOR had no interest in prosecution, but it is believed that some person or persons in the MIT administration wanted Swartz to spend at least few months behind bars for the trouble he caused and communicated this to the US Attorney's office.

Obviously, in the aftermath of Swartz's suicide, there aren't a lot of people stepping forth to claim responsibility. 









 That was fun. Thanks! 









 They've been talking about it for over a year now. It's a pretty serious proposal and doesn't require approval by congress, so I expect some version of it, maybe not the full salary bump, will go into effect some time before the end of Obama's term. 

I expect that a lot of organizations like yours, that rely on abusing low-paid, exempt employees, will have serious issues when it goes into effect.

Hours are hours, even if the task load isn't onerous. In my job, there's often time not a lot of work to actually do, but I have to be there and be attentive to the situation. Stretches without significant off time can be very wearing.

Can you push back on the events some? Either that or just start giving everyone, including yourself, days off mid-week? 

Also, if you're working so hard that you're sleeping on the office couch you need to stop that shit right now. You will seriously damage yourself and that's not going to help anyone.  

Sometimes for things to get fixed, you have to let them break. You working yourself and your staff like crazy to keep all the plates balanced is justr putting a band-aid on things. Maybe you need to call in sick for a few days and let things take their natural course.

Good luck!
 




 This is funny, but it reminds me of when I used to do comedy improv. There's a common bit where you're doing a scene and at random points you "forget" what you were going to say next and the audience is supposed to shout out a word to fill in the blank and you say that word and continue on based on it.

Nine times out of ten the audience would shout out "penis". 




 Can you bring your concerns to the board? Speak with each of them individually and express your concern?

From the sound of it, things will probably fly apart there once the new FLSA rules for exempt employees go into effect. All of the low level exempt employees who have been worked hard to keep things running will have to be either bumped up to the new exempt minimum ($970/wk) or be paid hourly.

In the meantime, you need to establish boundaries. You can't work yourself sick because there's not enough staffing. Work a reasonable amount and then go home. If things don't get done or fall by the wayside, so be it. As important as the work you're doing might be, it's not as important as your physical or mental health, The same goes for your staff.

There's probably not a good long-term solution here, so I'd think about planning your exit strategy now. 




 Can we get a bunch of ex-Navy Seals to team up and find this guy for the reward money? 3.8 Million is a lot of scratch.  









 At least she wasn't flogged or beheaded.  




 The minimum anyone should consider charging for a job like this is three times your original, hourly W-2 rate. 

Even in a situation where you left on good and friendly terms, your contracting rate should involve some pain for your ex-employer, now client because you don't want them to keep calling you. You want to provide every incentive for them to make themselves self-sufficient.  

If you don't, if your contracting rate is very reasonable, they will keep calling you...sure as hell. 



















 And if they agree to pay you a consulting fee, make sure you get the money before you start any work.  









 If the CEO of the company wants to run a company where he provides high-paying jobs to his friend's wives, there's probably not much you can do about it. There's no law against overpaying a useless slacker and underpaying the people who actually do the work.

If you want to, you can start documenting your interactions with Jane. Keep track of the work you've done for her and all the times you've helped her. You might even think about sending your boss e-mails with reports couched as status updates. Something like, "Just FYI: Did my ten TPS reports this week and, as per your instructions, I did the eight assigned to Jane as well".

Will this help? Probably not. 

The best thing you can do for yourself is get your resume together and start looking for a new job. Maybe if enough actual workers leave, the company will figure out what's going on.  




 Could be they're hazing him. Some places like to haze the new guy for a while.

Could also be they're just assholes.

Either way, just tell him to ignore it, don't take it personally and do his work. It will work itself out sooner or later. 




 It's important to understand that "Hostile Work Environment" is a specific term used in employment law and only applies if the hostility is due to the fact that you belong to a protected class.

There's no law against your boss being an asshole just because. 




 I work a 12 hour shift. I get off sometime between 8-8:30 AM and I'm usually home by 9:15, depending on traffic. I try to get to bed by 11, sleep six hours and then get ready to be to work by 8 again. 




 TIL: If I want tons of links from Reddit to my site, all I have to do is put some text in my TOU forbidding such links without express, written permission.

I'll be keeping that one in my pocket for a rainy day. 




 I seem to remember some similar shit about the F-14 back in the day. I remember reading some article about how when the F-14's tangled with F-4's playing the bad guys in war games, the F-14's got their asses handed to them.

This was many years ago, so I may be fuzzing some of the details. 




 Essentially what your boss is saying is that he'd like you to give the company a few hours a week of free work and then, after a few months of that, he'll consider giving you more money. Does that sound like a good deal to you?

Also, if you're not an exempt employee, you must be paid for all hours worked. If your lunch is normally unpaid and you work through it, you are legally entitled to be paid for it. 




 It's a fun film and very re-watchable. My daughter has seen it dozens of times and she wanted to name our dog Bolt. 




 There will always be people who want to eat actual animal meat, even if the vat-grown meat tastes, looks and smells exactly the same.  So I'm sure there will always be cows, chickens and pigs, albeit fewer of them.  




 Think of it as a learning experience. Sometimes knowledge and wisdom only come with pain and suffering.

If you get nothing out of this job except figuring out how to stand up for yourself to a shitty boss, it will have been well worth it. 




 Sometimes it's good to work shitty jobs for a while. There are important things to learn working a crap job.

Two important things:

* Don't ever ever EVER work off the clock. As an hourly employee you must be paid for every minute you work for the company. Unpaid work is theft. Don't let them bully you into working for free.

* Don't do anything that you feel is unsafe. No job is worth getting injured for.

Otherwise, try and figure out when to put your head down and take it and when to stand up for yourself. 

Good luck! 




 It's rare that a contract position like that means that you must work there for the full term of the contract or that they're obligated to actually employ you for that period. Obviously you should carefully read anything they give you to sign and understand it before you sign it. 

In the US, a contract position is basically a longer term temp and either party can leave anytime they like.  




 As the father of a six year-old I can say that I've sat through worse movies. 

It's not cringey bad or particularly stupid or annoying. It's a breezy 90 minutes with a bunch of minion business for the kids, a few jokes for the adults and a nice sixties vibe that plays pretty well, all things considered.

It is incredibly lazy. There's really no story or point to anything. Just a lot of running around and silliness and then it ends.

It made me think of some of the interviews Pete Docter gave about Inside/Out. Apparently the early versions of the script had a lot of funny bits with Joy and Fear, but it didn't go anywhere and didn't have much of a point to it. He worked on it constantly for months after that trying to crack it.

Whereas, when the Minons team got to the point they obviously just said, "Fuck it, good enough" and called it a day. 




 I thought it was good. Not great. Not amazing. Good.

The characters were good, but the story was kind of a muddle.  It might have been better of they had focused more on the individual character arcs and waited until the second season to hit hard on the evil sens8 corporation. 

Being familiar with the work of the Wachowskis and Straczynski, it was interesting to see them each take turns riding their particular hobby horses. 




 One of the few reasons left to actually go to the movie theater is that it's a distraction-free environment. I can seat in my seat, eat my overpriced popcorn and, for a blissful two hours or so, focus solely on the screen. No calls. No texts. No e-mails. No knocks at the door. No sad looks from the dog because he wants a treat. Just me and the film.

Just sit there, be quiet and watch the movie for fuck's sake. 




 As has been pointed out ad nauseum, he was in no way facing 35 years in prison. He was offered a plea deal of three months and it's unlikely, given Federal sentencing guidelines, that he would have been sentenced to more than a couple of years if he went to trial and was convicted.

Also, he was accused of more than just downloading science journals. He caused quite a bit of trouble for the MIT computer staff and his shenanigans have changed the way that people on MIT networks may access JSTOR.

Finally, sad as his death was, there's no evidence that his suicide was related to his prosecution. Swartz was a troubled young man who suffered from depression. He left no note or other indication of why he ended his life.  




 Sometimes I find it amazing that the human race manages to reproduce.  




 Present tense is acceptable for headlines for events that happened in the recent past.

"Florida Man Jumps Into Alligator Pen"

Although, in this case, it's a bit misleading. My fault for being lazy and not rewriting it.  




 I don't remember Blade Trinity being all that bad, although truthfully I don't remember much of it. 

I do remember watching it over at this chick's apartment and, in the opening scene the title says "Syria" and there's a sweeping aerial shot of the desert and it stops on this giant, pyramid thing. The girl I was with stands up and yells at the screen, "There are no ziggurats like that in Syria! There are no ziggurats like that in Syria!"

In that moment I knew that someday she would be my wife.  









 So...you've been working for free for the last two months?

You should probably speak to an attorney at this point. You're probably going to have to sue them to get your back pay. 




 That was my title, but I thought it was a fair summary. I wanted to add a little extra info in case Redditors didn't recognize Blazer's name.

I think he still counts as a whistleblower, even though he only did so under threat of prosecution.  




 Getting or giving? 




 Well, he did also take bribes and stuff. 

He told the truth and cooperated with authorities  so that he could avoid going to prison. 




 To be fair, he did admit to taking bribes and all other kind of illegal shit. He probably deserves the ban.

On the other hand, if they imposed this equally, they'd probably have to ban at least half of FIFA. 



















 I don't know. I never bought or sold anything there. Redditors on other threads have said it worked well for them.

Thing is, I have no problem with Reddit closing the marketplace. Sometimes you try something new and eventually you realize that it's not really working or it's not profitable or a distraction from your core competency or whatever. I don't think there's any moral imperative to keep services up and running forever. 

But, if you're going to close it down, give people some notice for fucks sake. Let people have at least a little time to work out a transition plan. What kind of shit-tastic organization shuts down a bunch of online stores without giving anyone any notice at all? 




 I think Snyder is going to hold on to the name until he can trade the name change for a new stadium deal. 




 Pronounced Loogey? Bold move, renaming your company a homonym for expectoration.  









 It's clear that the lesson from this is the same as the one from the recent unpleasantness. You should never ever rely on Reddit for anything. 

The people who run the site have show that they'll do whatever they like, without reason or notice, and if people are inconvenienced, unhappy or otherwise left hanging, that's their own issue.  




 As a Hymie from Hymie Town (actually Hymie Island, east of Hymie Town), I was never a big fan of the Reverend Jackson. I always saw him as a self-important, self-aggrandizing, blowhard. But this makes him pretty much the same as 95% of the political class.

Now I never liked him, but black people, a large majority of them, loved him and still love him.  For a long time he was one of the few black people who could get the mainstream media to listen to him. When there was a racial issue, Jesse would fly in and help shine a light on it, get it some media attention. 

And the racists, of course, hate him for that. Because the story of modern racists is that there is no racism. Anyone who tries to convince you that there is still racism and that racism is a still a problem is a con-artist, a "race hustler" in the parlance of the racist shit heel.

Has he done some bad things in his life? Sure. Pretty much all great men or those who aspire to greatness are serious assholes in one way or another.  But the inchoate rage that he inspires is people is all out of proportion for the things he's done or purported to have done. 

Look at the whole Hymie Town incident. To say he handled that badly would be an understatement, but it was over 30 years ago and people still want to throw that brick at him whenever his name comes up. 




 Just like the racists who are giving your comment all the down votes.  




 No. He has no right to grab her wrist at that point. 

If he really felt that that that drunkenly raised fist with her arm bent fully at the elbow and pointed at her own ear was a threat he could have raised his hand to ward it off or taken a step back. 

Instead he grabs her arm and roughly twists it downward. He had absolutely no right to do that.

She want to break free of his hold, so she raises her right knee and then comes across with a weak left.  At that point, again, the correct action is push off and step back. Instead he pops her hard in the face and then lets go and walks away.  




 He's awesome in it. 









 Seriously? Pearl Harbor and Nagasaki jokes after winning a soccer match? 

I guess some people think that's funny...or something.
