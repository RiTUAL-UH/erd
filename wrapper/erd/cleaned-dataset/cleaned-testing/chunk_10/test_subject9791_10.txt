 It's also a TV Channel in Malaysia costing RM10.60 (2.80 US Dollar)

The cheaper price means that you don't have the VOD option and you are stuck with what they show on the network

http://www.astro.com.my/whats-on/channel/wwe-network-hd/285

As you can see, they are just looping 3 or 4 shows a week. But since  the PPV is cheap (it cost around USD10 before this, so it's now 5x cheaper I just buy it for the PPV)

Apparently I have found them 









 the picture is at it is, meaning it was not changed as /u/tomF1 said.  




 I'll try see if they are still doing Caterham stock clearance locally. They were sold by Al Ikhsan in Malaysia and I thought i saw some outlet still stocking them last month 




 Umm no

Did I just saw Darren Young unleashing some barrage on BRRROCK LESNAR during that melee?

 




 I never have a mechanical keyboard before so I hope i can win : 




 But McLaren and Senna had used #27 too, and that was iconic in it's own right since that was the year Senna won the championship. 
 




 iirc they usually choose tracks that can offer them cheap price for testing, which is why testing are usually on weekdays to save further money 




 You can get a hybrid Lotus Elise for cheaper to be honest 




 There is one more factor. Trainwreck

The moment I heard the movie is out the week before battleground I knew Cena would win 









 That Bella is making the match flow jerky.  




 John "Blocking" Layfield

HAHAHAHA I LOVE IT MAGGLE! 




 Counter Strike: GO 




 During the "WWE List" show once, Miz said this: "Cena always portrays himself as the underdog, but he never once was. Only when he was facing Brock Lesnar that you feel that he might actually loose"
 









 Miz is awesome on the mic once he has his confidence and felt like a natural heel. Hence why he had that wwe championship run

Morrison was meh... At best. Never really remembered any significant promos that he did, even when he was the ECW champ 




 Hall of Pain Mark Henry using the chair on Big Show's ankle. Damn that was horrible to watch 


































 You can build a fully functional 6mm gun using only LEGO parts 




 I thought there is an auto mode where it's only function when there is low light? 














 Tank 




 Region restriction maybe. Meaning if you're in Japan you won't get njpw stuffs on the network like how the network is TV only in Malaysia without VOD

Thing is it WILL introduce current network subscribers to NJPW which would help their exposure in the USA 




 This is the best thread I've read today 




 Most likely this 




 A really sad news for motorsports in general. Not only F1. A promising young star. His Monaco race will forever be remembered by me as one of the best drive by a racer in an underperforming car 




 It think it was directly due to that incident. The management clearly has an SOP now of what to do when it happens again 




 Have Sasha in their stable and then for a PPV have Snoop Dog cameo 




 Same. I need to find that promo as well 




 Not to mention that welder prone to overheating. That's dedication for you 














 WELCOME! TO WEDNESDAY NIGHT WARS! 




 Good for him. And since football has a stringent drug test, especially in Europe WWE will be having a monster sized performer that should be drug free (barring any loophole stuffs)

Still remember him from the Bundesliga, and they could even make a storyline of him talking shit to the USA crowd about how Germany is no 1 in football and USA never go far in the World Cup. Instant heat 




 1 - Book a date opposite each other

2 - have NJPW send superstars to each promotion on that same date

3 - Make a fake war and calling each other out on twitter

4 - Having a crossover angle

5 - ???

6 - Profit!!! 




 No. The tyre wear was not as good as their expected, and they made the wrong call to pit under the safety car. 




 On something different, but quite similarly weird when talking about modern F1, Benneton and Schumacher tested an all wheel steering F1 car, where the rear tyres angles inwards when the front tyres is steering.

In theory it should mean the car is more steerable. In practice, it was not faster than a normal car. The system was ditched and the FIA promptly banned it (only two front tyres can steer the car rule)

Found the article: http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2007/03/22/banned-four-wheel-steering/

Those Audi are awesomely silent

Porsche sounds quite similar to F1's V6

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr4Z58oGmEc 




 Bloody hell the car never goes straight throughout the run 




 Because we finally see the impact of those moves on the wrestlers. Honestly after watching beyond the mat, I cringe at worthless impact move that damage the body just to get a pop from the fans 




 Someone who worked in WWE already posted here that it was. The problem with that particular slammy was that smarks that resented Reigns did not vote at all. Which means that kids and women that liked him voted and giving him the win 




 Tony "Schovantey" 




 But.. the Slammy's vote is legit :/ 




 Wow. Now that's screwing people up. And now I am more less likely to blame TNA for it 









 The reason for lack of managers? Cost. Any extra head that they don't need to transport to an event or pay for appearance is a cost saved. 




 Hmm. more likely his contract for performing is already finished but there is a clause for him not to appear in any other TV wrestling shows until LU's season has finished?

Reminder that LU's taping is longer than any other promotion, hence I think Hernandez didn't have work for so long that he thought it was okay to work?

either way it was fucked up by both TNA and Hernandez 









 He's always been good there. Winning in 2009 when everybody is saying it was just a one off pole still is up there in my mind.

heck he nearly won last year if not for his misfiring engine meaning he does not have enough power to pass Nando at the end 




 Thank you. As a non native English speaker, I know the title is wrong, I just don't know what it was 




 did it even have any WWE personnel in it? 









 Everytime Cena is on commentary, it bores me. He has this calm, droning voice that never changes no matter what happens in the ring. He tries to get people over, but for some reason his timing is off and he cuts off other commentators and tend to talk over them. 

Last night during the triple threat match it was really annoying to hear him. Thank god the match itself is good that he was easily filtered out

There are people like William Regal, that is calm on commentary but makes it work. He managed to convey enthusiasm and character in his commentary no matter how calm he sounds. But not Cena. 




 indeed. but it takes time to actually find that perfect character. You can be the best wrestler in the world but nobody would find you entertaining if you're character is not over with the fans.

 




 8 p.m. 3.43 million viewers

9 p.m. 3.51 million viewers

10 p.m. 3.65 million viewers

That's actually quite impressive as more people are tuning in. Usually the number drops off after 10 pm 




 Sasha brings the Power of Positivity! 




 Gab 2007 has a flying Raymond Stereo when he was not on the card as well

 PES 14 only has 16:9/4:3/5:4 support so I expect similar issues 




 Note that you need 3 exact same monitors for Nvidia Surround, but any 3 monitors will work with eyefinity. 

Eyefinity NEEDS to use the display port for one of your monitor tho. Most of the NVIDIA cards support surround on DVI/DVI/HDMI 




 The New Day of the Divas Division 




 officially launching tomorrow

"Hi. We are pleased to announce that WWE Networks will be launching on the Astro platform on 15th July 2015. To subscribe, you may refer to Astro Service Portal on Channel 200, call 603-9543 3838 " 




 I thought it was cheaper during Steam Summer Sales the other day? In any rate if you don't have a console and just want something to waste your time this is good enough. 2K made a good port (both keyboard and controller support). The only thing I hate is the lack of roster depth and the repetitive 2K career mode thing. God I hate that.

Thank god for trainers... 














 I need to ask how many times has Bran signed a new contract while Nick was in TNA 




 The fia medical team usually will test a driver if he has a prior health issue. Schumacher had to do it after he broke his leg in 99 




 Race day

Go to onboard channels

Hope that the driver that has the onboard that weekend has something interesting

Wait

???

Profit!!


Btw the UI on the video means that Rosberg was one of teh drivers that was fitted with the onboard camera by FOM that weekend, and this was recorded from teh onboard channel shown during race weekend 




 A blank page? 




 The one in charge of the race footage just missed an overtaking manouvre. Wtf

Holy shit that crash 




 Depends on your definition of real. Racing teams change ownership and rights throughout the years that it's hard to really keep track on who carries which legacy. IMO only Ferrari and Williams are still who they are as they were when they started. 

even the current McLaren is actually continuation of Ron Dennis's Project four racing team that merged with the original McLaren racing team but they kept the McLaren heritage. 




 *Whoopdeedoodee I am just driving this forklift and I will ignore all the racket that is happening above me* 









 1. There should be an incentive to finishing higher, hence why the point gaps will always goes smaller the lower you finishes. 

2. A close point gap means that a consistent driver  a fast driver. You could end up with a driver that does not win any race in the season finishing top. Something that happened once in Moto GP's 125cc category when the champion never won any race that year.


3. Reason 2 was why the current points scoring system was introduced. The previous point scoring system was criticized for not giving the "winningest" driver the most points.  




 Too many stories about it i think. I might have heard another version that yours. 

Makes sense tho, since the WWE Championship went to Smackdown! and the WHC went to RAW 




 1 - They wanted to

2 - No TV station wanted the WCW brand. AT ALL

Vince wanted to keep the WCW brand as a seperate entity as his roster was too big. But there were no TV station that wanted to carry it due to the stigma it had. He offered the network that carrying SmackDown at the time to put WCW on SmackDown's slot, but it was quickly shot down. Hence we had that stupid invasion angle and the death of WCW. But we have the roster split down the road, just as Vince wanted

I am dissapoint 









 WHAT IS BILL GATES DOING IN THE IMPACT ZONE? 




 It's a good opinion. but there is a reason LU can pull it off. For one, they are taped for a while back, and hence, why they could produce all those awesome looking camera angles and such, because they have time. Try being live, or taped with a time constraint (taping that is needed to be shown in a few weeks, instead of month for example) and I doubt it would still keep the same feel

Also it's too niche. I for one could still suspend my reality while watching TNA/WWE/ROH, but with LU, you have to watch it like watching a TV series/soap opera. There is no nagging feeling like something would blow up and change the industry, like the pipe bomb, or Jeff Jarret's GFW invading TNA. That reality factor IMO is severely lacking at the moment 




 Rowdy Roddy Piper is related to the Hart family 




 hahaha, cosplay Rin just for fun then! There is nothing wrong in that 




 Not as mich as she used to. She did some Kancolle last year

I was supposed to meet her for an interview during FuyuComi last year but she cancelled it last minute :/ 




 I wish the guy would have used landscape, because then we can see face of everyone when KO says that 









 I think some moves were new to the match and has yet to have a WWE name

Bloody Sunday for instance is not a PG friendly name and IIRC Finn has yet to use it in NXT hence the pregnant pause when he used it as I think Cole was in a conondrum.  




 I started with anime
Most, if not all anime OP and ED are now sung by pop artist (anime viewers trnd to buy singles so it's a good place to promo your songs). After a while you tend to gravitate to an artist or group and voila! You have now become a J Pop fan

I mostly only go to concerts in Singapore or Malaysia tho so my choice are limited.  




 Oh no. Fans usually buys the glow stick. Some are sold outside the concert hall, but hardcore fans would sometimes buy a battery powered version for more impact and longer lasting.

Sauce: I go to J Pop concerts 




 Hand them out and tell them to use it durinf the title match  




 fans did, but Johnny ace planned that spot 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEmzpNMIB7g 




 I usually called microsoft's helpline whenever I upgraded to another mobo, and says "my old one was broken and I upgraded" and they would reactivate my windows 



















 I remember listening to something similar in Gaki no Tsukai. Is it a generic Japanese riff music or something? 




 Basically bleacher report? 




 To add to that, Toto also said the guys from Brackley gave them the rain alert and how fast it was moving to the circuit.

In the end it was a sum of a lot of things but luck was not one of them 




 Then you better call somebody  




  from between 1809 and 1917 









 Make it similar to Cesaro. Have Roman lose with distraction, and down the line, Roman could say "Hey I nearly beat you, how about a 1 on 1 without any distractions or interference this time" and voila! A PPV match 




 It would be a win win situation, as Cena is right now making anyone that challenges him looks really good. Have Roman fighting the best he could, and the moment he looked like he could win, Bray will then come out and cost him the title. It would then make him angry with Bray more, as he would now cost him the Money in the Bank, stalk his daughter and costing him a title. They would be red hot going in Battlegroud

But then again, I won't expect any of this to happen 




 Jeff Jarret came out to promote GFW. Promises JJ vs HHH 




 SkySports says that Austria counts.  




 Actually the FIA and FOM knows this. Hamilton has a scruffy middle sectpr in the rain and Crofty immediately says "according to this Hamilton has run wide at Stowe" with "this" meaning the FIA info and he also said "Raikkonen has an off whilr we were not looking" 




 Orton and Cena was from the same development territory IIRC, which would explain that they are close 




 Depends. for me a stunner by any other wrestler is just a normal move. A stunner by Stone Cold? Well you better get a bed ready coz you ain't gonna stand back up from that 









 Will he come with Raymond Stereo as well? 




 ART is kinda McLaren/Honda junior team with Stoffel Vandoorne (McLaren) and Matsushita (Honda Dream Project) in the team

Ferrari has their Junior academy I think, but not a team per se. Bianchi and Marciello (GP2/Trident) is in this program. Note that Perez was also from their Junior Academy.

 




 I think they also planned for a while that the '16 game will be named 2K 3:16 or similar 




 It's gone now :/ 




 With the FIA monitoring radio, I think they would know that it's fake since the team would notify the driver to box if it was real 




 Yes, and even in the GP2 race Stanaway from 3rd passed both Vandoorne and Sirotkin at the start, so 3rd definitely has some more grip than pole and 2nd 














 More like they should have let Bottas through before the first stop. But then again Bottas was massively slower in the wet, so it won't have changed much 




 With NJPW having an awesome event the day after their house show, WWE needed to send their fans happy 




 WWE's camera crew did not come to Japan. It was done by a local station, JC sports, which shows WWE on their channel in Japan. 

Note that they are not actually perfect tho. There are some cases that WWE's style is better. For example when Finn was outside slamming into KO on the barricades, They followed Finn from behind, making it looks slower and less impactful. WWE under Dunn would shot it from the front making it look like it was a high impact move 




 There was a race I remember of Button's strap was loose, and he had to race with one hand holding it tight  

Edit: it was 2004. He managed to get 2nd http://www.autosport.com/news/atlasf1-report.php/id/14058/ 




 I've seen her naked. She's not ugly that's for sure 




 Holy fuck I love how KO fully embrace being heel. 

"I don't care I hate this stupid country and everything in it"

"C'mon let's count together" (while Finn was out)

Throwing the flowers away

"You see? This is stupid" (talking about the streamers) 









 Finn looks.. apprehensive? Scared? Whatever it is, it adds more drama and emotion to the match
