 My boyfriends family is from Spain and I really want to make authentic Morcilla de Burgos (morcilla with rice). Anyone have any tips on finding the best recipe for this? Thanks in advance! 




 "Grow up." 




 At first I thought this was a movie adaptation of "Les Revnants" which is a pretty sweet french show... Still, this looks great! 




 I 100% agree with this! Children are much more intelligent than people give them credit for. 




 That's a great way to explain it! Putting yourself in their perspective and keeping it simple. I like that.  




 I've always wondered how different people experience the concept of death and their own mortality. Especially children- superstitions and environment often play a huge role in understanding the finality of death and dying. 




 I'm so in love with Josh Ritter 




 I LOVE Keaton Henson. Christ he is a sad bastard 3

[Great Lake Swimmers - Stealing Tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GvdQG46vkc) - Introspective, haunting, lovely song  
  
[Josh Ritter - Wildfires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeFFrWIgHDw) - Methodical, minimalistic, intensive 




 Great Movie/Book 




 Are you a fucking dwarf? 




 Why not see if u/chooter will do this as a Mod rather than a Reddit employee? I'm certain she'd be more than willing to do AMAs voluntarily. 




 FUCKING YES. This. 




 Thank you so much! That's great to know! This helps me with the decision immensely  




 New brakes and shifters? My friend said the stem shifters on the Miyata can be more frustrating than the downshifters 




 Thanks! Talking this guy to $150 seems impossible, though. I agree it seems like a better bike but for the price I think the Miyata has more value if I just pay to fix it up a bit  




 Good point. The Miyata will require the girl to drive 30 minutes out of her way to deliver, though, so I feel like I'd need to commit to it if I were to ask her to come out here 




 That's how I felt... Unless this bike rode like a dream, $300 seems high. I just don't want to get ripped off if the Miyata is a compareable bike for more than half the cost 




 The nishiki apparently was just tuned up and got new tires... I do plan on using a rack and panniers so I wasn't sure which price was more reasonable... The Miyata looks like it's in good condition but it may need a tune up and I'll need to get a rack installed... 




 The nishiki apparently was just tuned up and got new tires... I do plan on using a rack and panniers so I wasn't sure which price was more reasonable... 




 Do you think the $100 bike is up to snuff in comparison? I was going to give the Nishiki guy my old commuter bike in hopes he'd knock off $85... I was going to give the bike away anyway but it's still a decent bike and salvageable  




 While value is important, having a bike that is worth the investment is more important to me. Could someone who actually knows what they're talking about take a peek at these two bikes on CL and tell me which I should go for? It would be for commuting mostly.  All help is super appreciated!!!

 Ha, yeah, my cat's name is Hercules and [he is a big 14 pound tabby](http://i.imgur.com/NFLCtgc.jpg). Sweet as can be, though! 




 Hey now, [my cat's name is Hercules](http://i.imgur.com/ki3QIdo.jpg)... How did your dog manage to sire a cat? These Grecian Gods are a tricky bunch... He sure is a cutie! Congrats on your new friend! 




 Haha, alright, fair enough.  




 A lot of this season is running gags and references to the first season. I highly encourage giving it a shot from the beginning. It's created by Dan Harmon; the guy who wrote for Community. 




 Hahaha, yes I caught that. So good. 




 Ha, they're watching Gazorpazorpfield in the background at 10:09

 See I saw this as Sarah being S's sister... Does no one else feel this way since she's the offspring of S's mom? 




 Difficult. Very difficult. I bounced around a lot and struggled a lot with depression but I like to think I became a bit stronger of a person after that...

---  
Miss you terribly already  
Miss the space between your eyelids,  
Where I'd stare through awkward sentences  
And void through awkward silence    

 nbsp;  

Miss your teeth when they chatter,  
When we smoked out in my garden  
When we couldn't sleep for all the heat,  
Soft talk began to harden    
  
 nbsp;  
  
Miss your small hands in the palm of mine,  
The fact they're good at making  
Miss you sitting up incessantly,  
And the fact you're always waking in the night  
And night    
  
 nbsp;  
  
And I,  
I hope for your life  
You forget about mine  
Forget about mine    

 nbsp;  
  
Miss your teeth dug in my shoulder,  
As we rolled in early morning,  
Miss your arm dying beneath me,  
As I lay there, simply yawning    
  
 nbsp;  
  
Please forget me, you were right dear  
I am cold and self-involved  
And though I'll miss you, recent lover  
I am weak and therefore fold    
  
 nbsp;  
  
Get distracted by my music,  
Think of nothing else but art  
I'll write my loneliness in poems,  
If I can just think how to start    
  
 nbsp;  
  
Dot my I's with eyebrow pencils,  
Close my eyelids, hide my eyes,  
I'll be idle in my ideals,  
Think of nothing else but I  
I
And I    
  
 nbsp;  
  
And I  
I hope for your life  
You can forget about mine  
Just forget about mine    
  
 nbsp;  
  
Oh, mine  
Mine   




 Josh Wallis is the man! He's working on my sleeve. Super chill guy. This is a great first :) 




 Burrowing owls and barn owls? :) 




 Great use of dramatic shading for the perspective! 




 Ahaha, great use of the prompt! 




 Wow, these are great!

Also sketched and painted with my hand switching method.  
I'm not very used to drawing people, so this was nice practice! No references were used, so I'll have to try that next time. 




 How do I do that?? 




 Thanks but that's not it... It's more like elevator music and lounge music sounding 




 The guy has a calm voice and I recall a part of the lyrics being like "and how am I to know" and has synthy sounding elevator like "do do do do do do.... Do do do do do do do do do". 

Haha sorry I don't have more info; it's driving me crazy I can't remember it 




 Thanks so much! You should try it sometime :) 




 Thank you! 




 Switch hands Sunday's! :D 




 Thank you so much! I hope to contribute more! :) 




 Thank you! You should try it some time, it's really fun. The trick is doing gesture lines rather than scribble sketch lines (for me at least) 




 Wow this is stunning 




 Oh wow, very well done! Super clean, too :) 




 Love your style. Kind of Ghibli-esque (but still very unique) 




 Hell yeah, that's gorgeous and you should be proud  




 This terrifies me. Great job!  




 Both are lovely! I don't know why, but the RGD reminds me of Jhonen Vasquez (but better)
