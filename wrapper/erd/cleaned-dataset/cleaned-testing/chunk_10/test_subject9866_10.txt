 This. People need to realize, especially at this age, that shit gets better. 




 Jansport. I currently use my Cousins from like '97 or something. Those last 5ever. 




 Can confirm. I'm a 14 Year Old going into Sophmore year and around 3/4 of my friends smoke either weed or cigs. I personally could give a shit what *they* do, since it doesn't affect me. 




 He loves you too, DrowningKittens.

 Everyone is dressed all fancy like and stuff.

 What law firm and where is it because I only will trust them.

 Hey, my friend wrote an article on this site. 




 I read that as Jose... not Jos. 




 Well, we now need context of 'soon'. We've heard a 7 second snippet of it, so we need to know what 'soon' means. A month? 3? 




 Yeah, but would they design a whole new entire shoe for one commercial? 




 Some Roshes or Chucks. 




 For casual wear or to ball in? 









 Oh, I'm sorry, must have missed that. My apologies 




 Might need a bit of a cleaning lol. Good find 




 Since I'm not too big on Foams I actually think the Penny's reign superior in this pack. But, that's just me. 




 Check the major retailers' websites first. Nike, Footlocker, Champs, etc. to see if they have the colourway you want. If not, then go to eBay. As /u/stewpidteenager said, *get a legit check first*. Last think you want is some fake shoes.

How you would go about that is posting a link to the listing on here or some pictures of the shoes and the nice members of this subreddit will help you out. Cheers, and good luck. 




 Most American picture I've seen on this sub. Good job. 




 They had a colourway of those Puma's at my local Ross. Good pickups though man. 




 Probably the LeBron 9 Hornet. Fell in love with the colourway and it was the first shoe I bought on my own, for $120. 




 Yeah I was just thinking that too. 




 *had* or *have*
