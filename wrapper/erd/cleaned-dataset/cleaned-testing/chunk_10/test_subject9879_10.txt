 I can't even fathom this.  




 Well we have a saying:

 Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. 




 Last three hours before my candidacy, I just said screw it, closed my books, and watched a film which I had watched and enjoyed a lot in my childhood. I enjoyed it again, and forgot that the mess called grad school existed. 

I passed my candidacy. 














 And yet sadly, the calm, boring guys are often the heroes. 




 Somebody had two male lovers - in that person's own words, and 
 It is believed he was gay. 

He was gay, and was a genuine military hero. Both things can and do coexist. 




 Because let them contribute something worthy first. Let an RSS ideologue make a film of Mrinal Sen calibre first, then we will have something to talk. 




 I am referring to the song - [DJ waley Babu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OulN7vTDq1I). How does such utter garbage become popular? Are we so utterly devoid of talent? 




 Ultimately in a country where a shit song like [DJ waley Babu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OulN7vTDq1I) is becoming insanely popular what else can you expect? Certainly not class and intelligence. 




 And he was gay too. So one of the founders of the modern American military was gay, and we did not let them serve?

Why were we so stupid? 




 Watch [Bakita Byaktigato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT_fFFFtctk). I linked it to the full youtube video, and while the film is in Bengali, the video is decently subtitled. It is partly a movie about romance, though I will better characterize it as a movie about *leela*.

In my opinion, it is probably one of the best 100 films ever made in India. 




 Even Lal Bahadur Shastri's death could be added to your list. 




 Open one in Texas, and name it Jade Helm. 




 Welcome. Have some wine. You were me 5 years back, and I hope that you find some peace, while not forgetting your humanity and your anger. 




 Sure. But everyone around you will think that you are immature. 




 I personally don't agree with the article at all. The second page of the article is an incoherent mess, bordering on Breitbart style lunacy.

But I find the article very illuminating, as these views are definitely not fringe, but are actually mainstream GOP electorate positions today. 









 There are two important reasons for that - reasons that are pretty obvious, but Mr. Murthy refuses to address them.

Big corporate ideas come from fresh undergraduates, and big scientific ideas come from fresh graduate students (a.k.a PhDs). Rather than the Indian education system, it is the India outside the university that has done its utmost best to squeeze these graduates. Keep in mind that many of India's undergrads are coming from shaky financial foundations. The societal and parental pressure to accept a stable, high-paying job is often immense. There goes your big corporate ideas. Thankfully, however this situation is rapidly changing, and the future does look bright.

When it comes to research, everyone blames the IITs and even IISc, but has anyone ever stopped to ask the question, "How much do we pay our graduate students?" Till a year back it was Rs 15,000 pm. The best and brightest undergrads go to USA for their PhD, and do not return. Multiple big inventions have been made by Indian born US scientists, so yes that talent pool was always there. And even after completing a top notch US grad degree only the extremely patriotic come back to India. An assistant professor at an IIT gets paid Rs 40,000 pm. Even after taking into purchasing power parity, an assistant professor at an IIT gets paid a third of what he would earn in USA. 

So Mr. Murthy, here is your answer - you pay peanuts - you get monkeys - not Nobel laureates. But isn't that the way you always ran Infosys yourself? 




 I think Ganguly cleaned it up better than Sachin.
