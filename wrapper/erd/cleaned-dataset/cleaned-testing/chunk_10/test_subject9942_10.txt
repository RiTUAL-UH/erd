 right...because knowing the truth about feminism is suddenly weak-minded
and you guys are the ones being coddled (sheltered from reality), taught that you need special treatment and what not and you are just projecting all that hatred onto us

dude, I know far more things (in math, social studies and science mainly but probably even more on other subjects too) than you 




 I've thought of that but it means you still have to play without throwing, right? 




 I mean reaching level 6 is fast and easy (maybe not so much for jungle) and early game was nerfed

also, you can win early game but will not finish the game fast enough so that weak early-strong late game champions catch back up? 




 are these asexuals female or non-binary?

I mean it doesn't even count because asexuals can also be bad people (especially since we have such small population, any few people is considerably alot)

but really, you are avoiding the question: provide examples in which feminism has helped anyone, including asexuals. 




 since you claim you have examples, why don't you show them?

also, it proves that there are bad feminists out there that discriminate against asexuals 




 ahh a victim telling others that they have a victim complex 




 my point exactly 




 right...

 hypocrite, you guys are just basically the same as these feminists attacking an asexual that she deserved to be raped
you guys are basically doing the same yourselves and insist that NAFALT, good job proving your statements

 I'm not blaming women (not all women are feminists) nor anyone

I'm criticizing some feminists for attacking some asexuals and that well feminism in general should go away but also if it doesn't, at least it should correct itself by calling out 'the bad feminists' and should stay away from LGBTQIA issues

if you're hiding behind dictionary definition
then feminists can also be defined as terrorists: the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims

These are being done by 'official' feminist groups (such as UN Women):

are you really going to sit here and tell me that they aren't real feminists too?

and I'm not trying to erase nb but men and women alone make up up to 99.7% of population...

also, MGTOW is not the counterpart to feminism, MRA is and they are 2 diff movements 




 thanks for agreeing with me and that may be but feminism is fairly clear that it is anti-man or terrible in many ways, this is just one of the ways

also take a look at here:

 look you people are trivializing matters that are important and harsher struggles for people who truly face discrimination, rejection or other actions that involve not wanting them

Now I support problems that can happen in the first world but you guys spread misinformation that it makes us look like tools:
Transgenders who are denied of their desired gender for example, but no you guys claim/make it seem that gender is a choice.

In fact, there are people that have it far worse (typically third world countries):
-Rohingya people are the most oppressed group of people and right now they are stateless and living in boats in the middle of nowhere
-women are victims of acid attacks in many South East Asian nations
and much more

in conclusion, you people have the audacity to trivialize everyone's matters over yours? 




 tell that to the feminists...o wait 




 really are you going to do this??

 Seems no one can find it and it's not a big deal equation

It's basically like proving the gaussian integral is specific value, which one cannot do without multivariable calculus, something along those lines.
