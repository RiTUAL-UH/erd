 The Harry Potter references make this story that much better! I laughed so hard at the Golden Snitch line! 




 That's been my fear. That's why I haven't tried to talk to it. I don't want to open myself up to possession. I know the full history of the house I'm in now. The other was a bit more blurry! I don't even know if my town has a historian, sadly  




 I definitely am! Just glad to be out of the other house! Never liked it from the first time we toured it. 




 Thank you! I have thought about that. I really hope it's him. It would make life that much easier. :) 




 Thank you. I would try to talk to it, but I'm really worried that it might be something more sinister. Something  trying to lead me into false comfort. 




 I wasn't going to post my story because I thought my life was back to normal. That was before last night. When weird things started happening, my step father had just been diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. The only people in my house were my mom, my step dad, my boyfriend, and me. My step father couldn't go to the bathroom himself, and if my mom had to go, she would call me into the living room to sit with him. He was never unattended. Furthermore, my room was right beside the bathroom. I could hear anyone coming in or out.

Let me also explain about my step father, he was a police officer and where I live, police have to get extensive physicals every year to stay on the force. He also frequently got strep, so he had blood work done every time he had it due to the hospital visit. We had just moved into an older house, and I always felt uneasy in the house. There was just something off about it. Less than a year after we move, my step dad who has always been given a clean bill of health was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. They said it had to have been there for at least 6-7 years. We had no clue where it had come from. I immediately thought of A Haunting in Connecticut, how the boy got sicker after moving into an old house. How else would I explain my step father getting so sick so fast?

When the weird stuff started happening to me, my boyfriend isn't living with me. I have always been deathly afraid of the dark. I've slept with my tv on for as long as I can remember. I can't stand the sounds houses make at night, so the sound drowns it out and provides light. I sleeping pretty peacefully when it was disturbed by a dream that wouldn't be scary to normal people. It was an older lady glaring at me. I've never seen this lady, but I had a deep feeling that she was evil and wanted to cause me harm. I woke up with a jolt and was overwhelmed with the same feeling I had in the dream. I can't explain how I know, but I knew it was her. Then I quickly noticed my tv was off. My mom wouldn't turn my tv off because she knows I need it. I got a horrible feeling of dread through me. I quickly grabbed my remote to get the tv back on. Needless to say, I didn't go back to sleep that night.

About a month and a half later, I was still getting that terrified feeling throughout my house occasionally, but I was starting I get used to it because my boyfriend started staying with me. We had been laying in bed all day because it was one of my few days off, so I would know if anyone had gone to the bathroom recently. When I got up to use the bathroom, I could hear water running, which was very odd because no one had been in there. It wasn't possible. When I opened the bathroom door, our bathroom was flooded because someone (something?) had turned our sink on full blast. I quickly called out to my mom who confirmed my suspicions. No one had been to the bathroom. As we cleaned the mess, my mom was comforting me, and I let her reason calm me, quickly turning away any thoughts of paranormal.

Sadly, the next part in my story was the worst time in my life. My step father had just been taken to the hospital, and the family had been called in. We were living at the hospital basically. My mom made me go to my grandmother's to get some rest, so my friend Molly drove me and My friend Robin to our respective houses. On the way to Robin's, Molly slammed the brakes and asked if we had seen something run I front of the car. Neither of us had, so we just assumed it was an animal because we live in a mountainous area. Animals weren't uncommon. Nothing happened the rest of the ride, until Molly dropped me off at the end of my drive way. As I was walking toward my house, I saw the figure of a man duck behind a car, so I took off at a sprint to get to the safety of home. When I turned around, I saw a black cat walking toward me from where I had just seen the man. I got into the house and locked the door. I texted Molly what had happened. She replied, "I don't want to scare you anymore, but I thought it was a black cat that I saw driving Robin home..." After a short conversation, I drifted off into an uneasy sleep. The next day, I went to my house to clean up some. I must explain that I lived in a high class neighborhood, so there were no stray animals around. When I got to my house, I saw a black cat sitting beside the door. After that, I quickly cleaned up because I didn't want to be in that house any longer. My step father died that night.

For a couple months after my step father died, everything was calm, so I chocked everything that had happened as stress. Then one morning as I was getting ready for class, I was brushing my teeth before I showered. I went to turn the water off, but I didn't turn the handle all the way, so I had to reach and turn the handle further. I got in the shower, but when I got out. The water was turned on full blast. After that, I started getting ready faster in the mornings, so I didn't have to be in the house. One morning, my mom was still home, so I decided to take my time getting ready. When I was in the shower, I could clearly hear my step father saying hello to me. I didn't get the terrified feeling I normally got. Instead I was filled with joy. The last thing that happened in that house before we moved happened around 3 am. I was working late shift, so it was common that I would be cooking at these times. As I was waiting on the oven to heat up, the coffee pot came on without anyone touching it. Now, some might think it could have been set like an alarm, but no one in my house drinks coffee. It was my step father's, so I went to investigate and the coffee pot wasn't even plugged in.

Finally, this brings me to the present. My mother went to the beach, but I stayed home because I had to work. One night, I heard growling coming from my living room, but both dogs were in bed with me. There was nothing in the house to make that sound. I closed my bedroom door and laid in bed, until I couldn't stay awake anymore. I was ecstatic when Mom came home the next day.

Finally, last night, the thing that made me post my story. I was going to get ready for work, so I walked through the house to get a towel. When I came back through, my mom asked what I was doing. I told her going to shower for work. She looked at me confused and said she thought I had already showered. She heard it running. My mom and I are the only ones in the house. I went to the bathroom to check out her claim. Nothing was out of place, no running water. I still didn't shower that night.

Please, tell me what is following my family and why it only affects me.

 That's so sad. Rape culture hurts men just as much as girls though. I just don't understand blaming a victim. I'm always horrified at those attitudes... "Well, she was showing cleavage, so she clearly wanted to have sex." What logic is that?! Most dressier women's clothing has some sort of cut to it. 




 I work at a small chain grocery store. In our store, anyone can walk into the meat department and from there the meat cooler. People leave the meat shop at probably 8-8:30 every night and manager leaves at 7. The problem? Everyone left is a regular associate. Regular associate's can't say anything to shoplifters, and if they would and something would happen, said store won't compensate because it's "not in the job description." Leading to a lot of stolen merchandise and workers getting yelled at by management... 




 Considering that you said it's lower class, it's kinda sad that it might have been nice to her. It might have been the best she could get, and she was just happy for it... 




 It could be PTSD. He could have been having a flashback to a military funeral where he was looking at the coffin of someone he knew and was saluting it... It's very sad. 




 I don't know if you looked at The Noble Collection online. They have a lot of cool stuff!
