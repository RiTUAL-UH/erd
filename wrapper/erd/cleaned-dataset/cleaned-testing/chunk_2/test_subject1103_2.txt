 As a college student, I am successful in my studies and refer  to myself often. Every time a quarter ends, I scan all my notes/papers/projects. I then store then in two places. Online and hard drive. I delete the hard copy, and enjoy a clutter, but organized academic folders.  




 Where do you work? I want free stuff 2 




 People get this sitmiga that education is affordable. It is, if you can afford it. Since you are not a candidate for any government assistance, you should invest into to look into third parties who will give you a loan with interest. Depends what UC, but tuition at UCR is 14k a year. If you tend to graduate in 4 years, you would owe. 56k in just tuition, not including the textbooks, parking passes, misconlanious purchases. If you're poor, it's better to stick to a CC, I've seen people who were in the same situation as you only to fail the 2nd year and owe 30k in money they aren't investable anymore.  




 How much $ do you make a year?  




 Here is a smile for you young adults entering the big scary world. Titties control a man, boom that's some wisdom you learn when you're 19.  




 Can confirm, seat is too small, to really protect against such events.  




 this is why you should bleed red.  




 I thought that wearing shirts is counter productive while swimming?  




 Why is he wearing a shirt?  




 I've been studying and experimenting  on this topic for a few months now. Thanks to your suffering and cried for attention I'm reaching the end. Since you helped me, I'll  tell you something. **YOU'RE MISSING LOVE**. You don't lose yourself if you want to die, voluntarily. You need love to fill your life. From reading your capricious text, I concluded to this analysis. Make yourself look/feel good and be promiscuous or just love yourself. No bulshit. I'm a year older than you and I got my life together- give or take. I've  never been where you are unlike the miliqtoast of commentators who  have. Don't listen to the people that spiral in the circle we call: depression.  




 CA Please.  




 Pm me a pass plz.  




 I bought a nike one 2 years ago, does it really help you? 




 I eat pigs, every Friday. You're no better if you do too. I would have eaten the pig alive if I had a choice.

 When I come home from work and see the kids waiting for me from the windows. 




 Seems like you lack discipline. I'm currently facing the same issue and that's after some insight. Assuming you're psychologically stable and all, of course. Just need to make it a habit that's all.   




 When I'm talking to a cute girl and she laughs at my jokes.  




 Love the apathy. You need to consider a program to mitigate these unwanted behaviors or thoughts.  Like life, nothing is easy. Good  luck!
