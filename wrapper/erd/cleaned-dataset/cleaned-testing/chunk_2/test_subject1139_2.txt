 [I liked the music better in the first PV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ0FdejcFf0) 














 It's a series. [You can watch it here.](http://kissanime.com/Anime/Space-Battleship-Yamato-2199) 









 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 and Kyousogiga. I love the 70's vibe, the militaristic sound and the use of brass instruments in Yamato 2199...really got me pumped for the huge battles. While Kyousogiga's music hit that sentimental spot. 




 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 














 Nyahaha
 









 The series is set in the same universe as [The Princess and the Pilot movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qomwjPIerM). 









 I love how Gintama manges to make juvenile humor funny again. These are the type of humor that you feel like you have moved on from as you got older but then you see something like Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon and Peen-san and you just can't help but burst out laughing. 




 The whole harem arc. Also any Shinpachi romance arc is hilarious. 




 Resident Evil is a popular Japanese made game so there's a decent brand recognition.  









 The filler and non-filler episodes prior to the Kyoto arc weren't good either but the ones past the Kyoto arc really are an absolute bore. Well I guess the the Shougo Arc was some what decent. 




 To anyone who played the VN, which route do you think is the anime taking?

I don't mind being spoiled. 




 Despite being selfish and not doing what's best for both Touma and Haruki, Setsuna is still the most honest one of the group therefore my best girl. 




 lol this show has gone completely bonkers.

 Yep, Bargs is a good 1-on-1 defender. He's lost in help defense though. 




 I want a "I'll take a potato chip and eat it" dance number. 




 This episode was fun.

This show keeps going through tonal shifts. From lighthearted beginnings of a hero, to full blown tokusatsu cheese then to something dark.

I hope we get some background info on King Torture because right now he comes off as a random evil genius.

 Touma's train stop is at Iwazu-cho which is in Okazaki. She flew from Okazaki to Tokyo. 




 I think Haruki is overcompensating. He realizes he has feelings for Touma which makes him feel guilty so he compensates for that by rushing his relationship with Setsuna hoping it would drown out whatever he feels for Touma. 









 I'm so confused by this show right now. I thought the show was starting to hit its stride in ep. 6 and in the second half of 7. I was starting to have a grasp on what direction the show is going then this wacky tonal shift happened.

I'm just hoping for a payoff that would make sense and justify this tonal shift in a gratifying manner.

 Gintama has some heart wrenching moments too. [This dog story](http://vimeo.com/38013872) was such a tearjerker, almost as good as Futurama's Jurassic Bark. 









 Holy shit I don't know how to respond to this.

I was half expecting the show to go Steins;Gate on us, which means having a slow build up leading to shit hitting the fan really fast but I didn't expect the show to go full blown superhero.

I'll go with a wait and see approach before I react to this.

 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 is my runaway AOTY. 









 [They're following the Gintama strategy](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/070/4/9/gintama_yaoi_motivational_by_sweetshounenai-d3bdrp2.jpg)

edit: FYI Gin and Goto share the same voice actor. 




 Oh man, this episode was hilarious. It also did a fine job of showing Masayoshi's dedication and pure intentions in a charming way without coming off corny or overly preachy.

Another thing I liked was Mari's little slip of the tongue about letting off steam, I guess that confirms she's really in it for thrill and excitement.

Also Gotobro exuded so much broness in this episode.

I need more Sumi screentime. 














 This was an excellent episode but then again most things about Yamato 2199 are excellent. More people should watch this show! 




 Reaper and Pushing Daisies, both have the quirkiness and eccentricity that might be better expressed in anime form. Also Better Off Ted as a SOL anime.

Maybe I'm just mentioning shows I felt were canceled so abruptly.  









 Moe waiting for a kiss from Mari was funny.

I like how both Mari and Masayoshi hit a lull in their superhero career and how they dealt with it differently. Masayoshi's passion for heroism was starting to fade and he was becoming jaded, then he realized he's doing this not for fun, not for the hero ego boost but for justice. While Mari was just getting bored since she has little purpose other than entertainment so she dealt with her boredom by upping the ante of her antics.

Looks like both Goto and Hazama will find a common sense of purpose and really start working together. 














 I'm surprised there were no Faye Valentine versions. The Haruhi bunny costume one was the best. 














 as expected akira loses to mori

I'm glad they didn't drag that out into a love triangle. The romance was unobtrusive and served as a good complement to the main story. 




 The Walking Dead is mainstream. The ratings for last season were high and this season's are even better. 




 Highly recommended anime. [Watch it here.](http://kissanime.com/Anime/Space-Battleship-Yamato-2199) 














 If the gif can fit in that 2mb limit without being a gif for ants or a grainy mess due to low image quality. 









  I mean, this show is about a treasure hunt basically, but this episode didn't include any part of the treasure-hunting! I'm feeling like the show doesn't really know how much time they should spend on characterization that is not the best I've ever seen but still, fairly standard.

Totally agreed with this. The lack of balance between character development and storytelling leads to pretty bad pacing. As a result the treasure just conveniently shows up instead of being discovered. Then there are these random action scenes that just pop up out of nowhere with very little set up.

Despite these glaring flaws I can't get myself to drop this show. 




 Crotch shots is cheap humor but the show somehow made it work. I guess the character, sound effects and the delivery are what got a laugh out of me.

I'm still enjoying this but it's the Goto and Masayoshi dialogue that made the show engaging and it's kind of veering away from that. Also it feels a bit directionless, other than character introductions the main story has been stagnant. I hope we see more progression since most of the main cast have been established.

 Some of the more recent Ghibli movies are pretty underrated.

From Up on Poppy Hill [(Watch it here)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQD4VH4Drvk)

 **Wolf Children.** It's a sentimental and emotionally moving movie about a young mother raising her two kids that are part wolf in the Japanese countryside.

[Here's some stills](http://imgur.com/a/7yBMB)

[Watch it here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7H0Vcl8kIw)

Also check out Le jour des corneilles (The Day Of Crows). It's a very sweet french animation movie. 














 With that much muscle mass I highly doubt he neglected developing glamour muscles like the chest. Some people are just lacking genetically in certain areas. 









 Synopsis:

Hana is a 19-year-old student who falls in a "fairy-tale like" love with a "wolf man". Over the course of the 13-year story Hana gives birth to two children - older sister Yuki, and younger brother Ame, or "Snow and Rain". At first the family quietly lives in the city trying to hide their wolf heritage, but when the "wolf man" suddenly dies Hana makes the decision to move to a rural town, far from their previous city life. 









 They would all get it...get congratulations for graduating.

 Also watch [From Up A Poppy Hill](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQD4VH4Drvk).

As for non-Ghibli movies I'd recommend [Hotarubi no Mori e](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grTUkLgHwGM) and Wolf Children.
