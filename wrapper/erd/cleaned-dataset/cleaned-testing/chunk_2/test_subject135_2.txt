 I was pretty disappointed in the execution. That said, I do plan on reading the "companion book," A God in Ruins, which is supposed to come out in May 2015. 




 New York Public Library. 




 Because I can get pretty much any movie I want for free from my library.  




 She's the one with the problem if you're being honest about not cheating or using pornography excessively and about showing her that you love her and find her attractive. If you can't have an open, honest conversation just the two of you, you might want to consider couples counseling for the two of you and individual counseling for her or for you if she refuses, so you can learn to respond to her comments effectively instead of defensively. 




 Only when there is absolutely no positive aspect to the relationship. After all, you never know when you might need a kidney. 




 You should get a food scale and all kinds of measuring implements and make sure that she's not overeating. That's what my problem was as a kid -- even though I ate healthy foods, I ate way too much of it. 

Also, regarding dessert, try to avoid having it on a daily basis -- keep it for special occasions only. 




 An example would be helpful. 




 This year Scotland voted for independence. It's not such an imaginary line. 




 Looks almost like nazi-propaganda.

But, but, but the video description says it's not propaganda! 




 Clive Owen. 




 Either way, she isn't supposed to look like Jennifer Lawrence. 




 In the UK, national identity is pretty important. Someone who is English is not Scottish. They are not any more interchangeable than black and white are. 




 They need to do a study where the students are randomly assigned to their seats. Or they can look at schools where kids are seated by alphabetical order, which makes things relatively random. 




 You don't need to have an excess of iron for your blood to help someone and potentially save their life. Go donate! 




 I think you should ask your girlfriend why she thinks it's an awful idea.  




 In most cases the person is mentally ill, so it's not a rational decision that they make. 




 Or the opposite way around: A civil suit is legalized extortion. Pay me X amount of money and I'll stop accusing you in public of rape. Don't feel like paying me? I'll keep talking and we'll go to trial then the accusations will be on public record forever. 




 People in high school when I was in middle school looked 20. People in high school when I was in college looked 12.

In other words: This is just your perspective. And a backwards one at that. 




 There used to be a picture of me on Google Streetview near my work. Thank goodness it's not there anymore. I thought they caught me a second time in almost the exact same spot, but I'm not there so I guess the camera wasn't on -- the car must have just been passing by. 




 They also reposted the title without thinking. 




 Telivah

*tevilah  




 It usually takes about two hours for a play to be performed, so considering you're reading it to yourself, it should take under two hours. Even though it's 120 pages, it's mostly white space. 




 Certainly there is a genetic susceptibility to cancer. For example, a woman with a BRCA1 or 2 gene is far more likely to get breast cancer than a woman without the mutation.

But even if you don't have a specific genetic susceptibility, you are exposing yourself to cancer-causing agents all the time, knowingly or not. Though I don't believe they have any explanation for why someone who smokes can die at 35 of lung cancer while someone else who smokes can die at 100 of natural causes. 




 That is so awesome. I would love to have a pet goat that I took on adventures around town. My life would be a children's book! 




 Component parts: "curly-twirly"

LOL. 




 He is wrong. Probably he confused kiddush with havdalah. 




 While I'm sure you're intentions are good I feel I should ask if you've brought the issue to the attention of the library staff. 

I haven't, but if I can figure out who to contact, I can send an e-mail. 

Could you, perhaps, volunteer at the library so they could use your desire to shelve where they deem it most necessary?

At the moment they're only accepting volunteers during the day, and I'm not available then. 




 Agree, though MIT is a specialized science school, so I suppose it's a bit more prestigious in its field than Oxford or Cambridge, which I don't even know if they offer science degrees.  




 Interesting etymology of the -crat ending.

-cracy 

word-forming element forming nouns meaning "rule or government by," from French -cratie or directly from Medieval Latin -cratia, from Greek -kratia "power, might; rule, sway; power over; a power, authority," from kratos "strength," from PIE *kre-tes- "power, strength," suffixed form of root *kar-/*ker- "hard" (see hard). The connective -o- has come to be viewed as part of it. Productive in English from c.1800.

 Some of you might remember from a little while back that I was doing some amateur shelf reading. Someone recommended that I avoid doing non-fiction and I wholeheartedly agreed until today. I was looking for a play and discovered the non-fiction was in just as bad shape -- if not worse -- than the fiction.

The play I was looking for was listed in the catalogue as available but was nowhere to be seen. Which was not surprising considering what I found. It might have been anywhere. 

There was one thing I didn't understand. A dual-language book of poetry had the Dewey Decimal Number of something like Gle 891.621 N Dhomhnail. (I don't think this is the exact book, but it was a similar number.) I couldn't figure out what the Gle was supposed to mean so I just left the book on a shelf and hoped somebody who worked there would find its correct home, which, now that I'm looking in the catalogue, appears to be on a different floor entirely. 

I have the feeling that this poor little book will never find its home. And nobody will ever take it out because it's not where it's supposed to be and then it'll get weeded because nobody's taken it out in X number of years.

Oh the humanity!  




 I liked the Rithmatist. The writing was clearly for kids and the story cliched at times, but the concept was clever and different. Seems like something many Redditors would like. 




 My neighbor gave me cookies.  




 *Series. It's singular and plural. 




 I don't find this is true at all. His books are hit and miss and his most recent books haven't been good at all. I couldn't get through even one Tiffany Aching book. 




 Absolutely. When I was younger I pretty much only got books by browsing the library shelves, but as I've gotten older, that hasn't worked out for me as well. So now I keep extensive to-read lists. 

Though I still love browsing. Looking at the different covers and reading through summaries are great, even if I don't even up taking the books. 




 It's actually recommended that you don't read right before bed because reading is stimulating -- it makes you think, and thinking can keep you from falling asleep. I have personally found that even a boring book can be stimulating. Once I stopped reading right before bed, I started falling asleep a lot faster. 




 This news was posted to like four other subreddits ages ago, so why is this the first I'm hearing of it?!?! 









 This is the original journal article: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3087/full

There must be parts I'm not understanding because I'm not seeing what OP's article says. 




 I do believe that, with patience and practice, the concepts laid out in these books can be effective and can actually work.

I'll believe it when I see it.  




 Bret Easton Ellis is known to be a nasty guy so I wouldn't be surprised if he wouldn't do it. 




 My old boss used to swear by that book and also Getting To Yes. You know how often he got to yes? Never. Never ever. These sorts of things only work when both parties are there in good faith, that even though the parties don't agree, they're both are interested in resolving the situation. When you're dealing with somebody whose attitude is "my way or the highway" you can build rapport with them until the cows come home, you'll still never get anywhere. 




 Or just drink tap water.  




 He's not really dumb, he's just self-centered and disorganized. 




 The police will look for you. If you don't tell anybody what you're doing, how are they supposed to to know you're alive and okay, not kidnapped or dead? 




 I don't know where you shop, but it's generally very easy to find plus-size clothing. It's not as easy to find plus-size clothing that doesn't look horrible, but that's been changing. 




 Because they can't talk.  




 In the UK a far lower percentage of teens go to college than in the US so there isn't a glut yet. Also in the UK it's much more acceptable for people to do things that don't require a degree. In America, parents aspire for their children to be professionals regardless of whether they're cut out for it or not. 




 The Pill increases a woman's chance of getting cancer and blood clots. On the more minor side side, many women gain weight on it or get acne. Hormonal birth control is very far from being completely safe and having little to no side effects. 




 The second video isn't a music video, it's a live performance.

Start reading here: 

In his autobiography, Tony Bennett claims to have created "...the first music video" when he was filmed walking along the Serpentine in Hyde Park, London in 1956, with the resulting clip being set to his recording of the song "Stranger in Paradise".[8] The clip was sent to UK and US television stations and aired on shows including Dick Clark's American Bandstand.[9]

 Here's a site selling them. They don't remotely scream "Jewish" to me: http://www.leelach.com/tichel/sinar-tichel.html 




 I watched the movie a couple of weeks ago and am currently in middle of the book. It's a very faithful adaptation so it really doesn't matter which you experienced first, and anyway, it's almost always better to watch the movie first. 




 I'm going in early spring. I'm interested in the arts, hopefully with a local flavor. 




  I love her for who she is, not because I have to as her mom.

I don't see the problem here. That's exactly how a parent should love their kid -- for who they are. In my opinion people who only love their kid because it's their kid are usually pretty messed up. Having both is ideal, but if you only can have one, I'll choose your way over the other way any time. 




 At my work, back in the day when they issued paper checks, employees were given an extra 15-minute break on payday in order to go to the bank. 

I'm not sure why "most people" in OP's question can't go to the bank during their lunch hour if this extra break isn't a perk they get. 




 It's been a while since I've read them, but IIRC in Very Bad Deaths and Very Hard Choices by Spider Robinson a character had uncontrollable telepathy and couldn't stand to be around anyone except this one guy. (Not romances.) I didn't like them as much as I wanted to, but I'd generally recommend Spider Robinson so long as you're willing to put up with blatant political preaching. 




 Thanks! 




 A bunch of university libraries and the NYPL have it. See if you can get to one of those libraries or if your local library can request it via interlibrary-loan. Unless you want to buy it for upwards of $100. 




 I've read books with that premise. Maybe not with vampires, but the person who can read everybody's mind except for that one special someone. 




 Thanks, but I guess I should have specified how is it that they play the game so well? I've played various levels of, say, Angry Birds, like 50 times and I'm lucky to get 1 star and they're getting 3 stars. 




 ETA: I meant how is it that they play the games so well? I've played a level of say, Angry Birds like 50 times and I'm lucky to get past it with 1 star, forget 3 stars. Sometimes I can't manage 3 stars even when I'm copying the walkthrough.  




 It's a relatively common phrase/sentiment that's been around way before the Office (started in 2005) and Reddit (started in 2005). 




 MI5 comes to mind. It's not "the MI5." 

Honestly, I don't believe there's any real answer to this aside from "that's just the way we talk," but certainly the answer is not "there needs to be a the." There doesn't *need* to be a "the." 




 That's not an answer. In America we don't say "the ABC" (American Broadcasting Company). 




 Yes, 35. And that's one of my problems with the books -- I don't get the feeling that Rowling has any idea what 35-year-old men are actually like. 




 Too old. Despite the fact that Strike comes across as old and grumpy and decrepit in the books, he's only 35. Dominic West is 45 and looks it. 




 Weird fonts. Right now I'm reading a book that looks like it came out of a mid-1990s inkjet printer. It's so distracting. 




 I'd say I read 90% genre fiction. Literary fiction almost always disappoints and I like to take my time with classics, so I tend not to read very many of those types of books. 




 See if your library has an interlibrary-loan service. 




 Ha-ha. 

"a recessed landscape design element that creates a vertical barrier while preserving views" 




 People who have trouble backing out of parking spaces usually taking 2-3 times the amount of time than usual.

Can't say I've ever seen this particularly. Though maybe they're being careful. That's a sign of a good driver, not a bad one.

People who insist on yielding to you when it's clear they have the right of way.

Have experienced this all over NYC, nothing to do with wealth or competence. People think they're being polite by yielding.

People who drive well below the speed limit in broad daylight and perfect weather.

Do you live in a city with a lot of old people?

People react much slower whenever the light turns green at intersections.

Yup, you live in a city with a lot of old people. 




 I hear it everywhere that it had a big influence on today's world.

Where have you heard that? In relation to what? 




 Da Vinci worked on commission. 

Galileo worked in academia.

Wikipedia is your friend. 




 Yup. I don't think the art linked in the pictures is particularly good. In fact, it barely qualifies as fine art. As far as I can tell it's the artistic equivalent of Muzak -- bland and uninteresting. 









 What are some things to do in the cities in the evening besides for bars and clubs? 




 NYC housing market -- Mitchell Lama is mentioned but not public housing? 




 Me too. It recommended the Monster at the End of This Book. While that's a super book, I'm not sure it follows as a recommendation based on my ratings.

Also, a lot of books I searched for didn't come up. Maybe they would have if I had the ISBN's, but I don't have time for that.  




 That's right. It's old school sexism. Huge difference between sexism and misogyny.  




 I had to look at the picture three times before I saw the swastikas.  




 "Lincoln, sometimes I think I've walked into a Quentin Tarantino move when I'm talking to you."

The Skin Collector by Jeffery Deaver. Not one of this best. 




 The Book of Raziel the Angel. I found it somewhere and thought it was cool, so I stuck it in my bag and never took it out. It's about two inches square and the print is so small you can barely read it without a magnifying glass. 




 but don't know enough of the back story to understand how it came about

So that's the thing. The person wasn't necessarily "involuntarily" put there like they were committed to a mental hospital, but more likely were pressured into going most likely because the family didn't want to and/or couldn't afford to take care of them at home. 




 It's not an old wives' tale, the toothbrush makers do suggest this, but it's really just their way of trying to force you to buy a new toothbrush. 




 French, German, Dutch.

Laotian, Tagalog, Malay.

So, the answer is that neither of these is a typical ending for either language group, they're just ones you can think off the top of your head. 




 Sure they do. I once interviewed with an editor of a mystery magazine. I don't remember how it came up but she said they didn't take stories from bestselling authors because they refused to be edited.  




 Nobody's perfect. I recently watched a news interview from the studio that the station also streamed online. When they went to commercial, the screen was supposed to go blank and the mikes were supposed to cut out, but the first time they went to commercial, the mikes stayed on. They kept talking. I don't think anybody embarrassed themselves, but what they said wasn't really meant for public consumption either.

Point is, the camera and the mikes are controlled separately. You assume that when the camera is off so are the mikes, but obviously it's not always the case and there's no little red dot to show you that the mikes are off. 




 In many cases, curing a disease would have to entail gene therapy and we're very very far away from that being a typical treatment. 




 Like anything else that people try to do, learning a language requires a bit of talent. Not everybody has it. So when they hear a foreign sound, they simply aren't able to recreate it. Or they can't hear that they haven't pronounced it correctly -- like being tone deaf and trying to sing. 

Also, not everybody learns a foreign language from a native speaker. My French teacher in high school was American and her French accent wasn't that great. So it's not like I had anywhere to learn a French accent from in the first place. 




 I can't understand that thinking. People I know either enjoy reading or they just don't read. I never knew anybody who felt the need to force themselves to read if they didn't enjoy doing it. 




 Psalms are always good for when you're feeling bad. 

I wouldn't recommend talking to a rabbi regarding serious psychological issues. It has nothing to do with respect for them, that's silly, they're pastoral leaders, it's part of their job to help congregants, but at the same time, if you're have serious issues, unless they're also trained in psychology, I don't think they'd have much to offer to you any more than a close friend would. 

Unless you're specifically interested in learning about Judaism and Jewish rituals. Then by all means, go for it. 




 Not everybody affiliates themselves with a denomination. They just recognize that they were born to Jewish mothers and then don't incorporate a Jewish identity into their lives in any way. Considering that Lisa Bonet and her mother both married non-Jewish men, I'm going to have to go with no denomination. 




 Why do people who read have to have goals? I mean, what are your TV goals for 2015? What are you music goals for 2015? 




 It's because if a series is successful, the editors stop editing. They just publish all what the author wrote and particularly when it comes to fantasy series, these authors have a tendency to be wordy.  




 There's really no way of knowing why it hasn't come out yet. Things were happening behind the scenes that prevented it from being published, that's all that's possible to say. At the moment it's scheduled to be released in July 2015. 




 HP wasn't good, it was a phenomenon. The next phenomenon will come around sooner or later but you won't be the right age group to appreciate it. 

The Percy Jackson series is almost entirely for preteens.

You say that like it's a problem. Not all books are written for teens, you know. 




 A while back I had this type of dream. I interpreted it to mean that I was going on the Internet too much and was yearning for it like an addict. 




 Good on you. 




 It's inappropriate, that's for sure. Considering your friend is 16, family counseling might be better idea than going into foster care. 




 I could use $1,000 right now, so yes. 




 I liked Infernal Affairs much better though I kind of got the impression that if I hadn't seen The Departed first, I might not have known what was going on. 




 Beats me, I thought Viggo was severely miscast.  




 Not that I particularly disagree with what's already been said, but my grandparents had opaque glass, so clear glass is at least partially just a trend. If you Google "frosted shower glass" you'll see that it's around. It's just not as popular as clear. 




 The difference is that Santa Claus has its origins in Saint Nicholas, who was a real person. There's nothing to believe there in the first place. It's just a story and everybody who isn't 6 knows that. 




 No.

This sort of thinking made me want to throw Divergent across the room. 




 I bought one, but I guess it wasn't good quality because all it did was give me a headache. And honestly I don't feel like spending hundreds of dollars on a lamp. 




 114 so far. Huh. That's on the low side for me. Though I will definitely finish at least 6 more by year's end. I already posted the best books, so here are my worst:

2.5/5 stars:

- The Monkey's Raincoat by Robert Crais

- Murder on Bamboo Lane by Naomi Hirahara

2/5 stars:

- The Contortionist's Handbook by Craig Clevenger

- The Death Trade by Jack Higgins 




 Entirely true, but might be more appropriate to post in /r/writing. 




 Definitely keep it. It can never hurt to work on yourself to be a stronger, happier, healthier person. 




 25% or less. 




 I only wear concealer to cover up the dark circles under my eyes and the occasional spot. Takes a few seconds. 




 Entirely depends when and where the person died. On someone's doorstep, probably pretty quickly. Under a bridge, not so quickly, especially in the winter. 




 Einstein's Dreams! Definitely go with that. In terms of readability, it's short and very easy reading, very easy to understand, but it gives you a lot to think about.  




 I don't use Goodreads, but I just checked a few of the books I've read recently against Amazon's ratings and Goodreads seems slightly more accurate. Not by a lot, but on Amazon, almost every distribution of ratings is the same: A huge amount of 5 star reviews and then fewer and fewer of the rest. While on Goodreads the distributions don't have any kind of pattern. 

But I don't really find overall ratings all that helpful anyway. Usually it's the 3-star reviews that have the most objective reviews and you can get 3-star reviews on both sites. 




 Agreed. He's projecting his own stress, unhappiness and resentment. While I'm unhappy with my work I'm not especially stressed (not a secretary, but still an underling). My bosses on the other hand, are super-stressed. They have high-power, high-pressure jobs and bosses that come down on them harder than anyone ever comes down on me if I mess up. They have a lot more responsibility than I do, and that creates stress.

When I moved into a windowless cubicle it definitely disrupted my sleeping pattern to the extent that it was night for me twice a day. Ever since I started taking Vitamin D about a month ago I've been sleeping better and losing weight without altering anything else in my life.  




 It is frowned upon.  




 How is obesity escapism?

Eating in order to drown your feelings is definitely viewed negatively. So is laziness, if it's excessive.
