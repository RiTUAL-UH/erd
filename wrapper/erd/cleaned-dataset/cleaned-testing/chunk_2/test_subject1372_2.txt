 They never use it because the company purposely clocks them at lower speeds by forcing them to be slower than what they paid for.  




 Use more tha. One devise at the same time (think a family full of iPhones abd/or laptops), any decent gaming, browsing that loads a page in I see a minute. Etcetera.  




 Dear AT T: 

It's because you fucking suck.  




 Because motion controls and a mirror world made it different, no naturally, gamers didn't like it.  




 That still happened. Priest Seto and Atem were rivals in competition. Step was loyal to Atem.  




 *facepalm* 




 /r/nosleep. The rules say that the stories must be real. I don't know why the discord posts here say no sleep is full of fiction.  




 It would use a comma, not a colon or semicolon. the effect is continuous and does not start a chain at any point. 




 How? Apple said they cannot decrypt the data. 




 I think burning down some major ISP buildings (at a time when nobody is there of corse) might be what we need to send a fucking message. Let's turn the buildings of ISPs into parking lots. We're better off like that anyway. 




 Some networks got huge upgrades rolled out... but companies are still using the old technology. They literally refuse to give us better service. 




 So, because they will no longer be allowed to throttle any data whatsoever, they wont be able to improve their service? BULLSHIT. They're already bleeding money trying to bribe congress to get what they want.

Did i mention Wolf-pac.com? 




 So, basically, any time priority is opened to a player, PPP takes place to check if anything was triggered. Is this correct? 




 It depends on the game. Smash bros an amiibo can put a fighter in the game that learns based on the play styles of those who play against it. Mario Kart, the same amiibo could unlock a costume for your mii racer. Some amiibo are not compatible with certain games, but beside that point, a single amiibo can count more than once while a single DLC purchase is a one and done deal.  




 My best guess is because Enter play didn't see a need for a side-board. 




 I've been reading up on priority and pre priority processing. I still don't fully get it the way enter play explains it. Could someone explain it in a way that will make a Yugioh player understand? 

In yugioh, we have what is called an open game state where turn player has first priority to do something. Non-turn player wait to respond. When an action takes place, the game looks for triggered effects, then for either player to start or continue a chain of effects. If nothing, then the game state goes back to open. If an effect is activated, a chain is built, resolved, then the game goes back to checking for triggered effects.

How does our priority compare in this context?  




 You're welcome. 




 The fact that the PS4 and Xbox One have almost identical libraries with little to no true-must-have games on their exclusive line-ups is a big deal. Especially when you look at the Library for the Wii U which has had plenty of exclusives that you simply cannot play anywhere else. The Wii U may not be as powerful on paper, but the games are built around fun instead of built around pushing graphical boundaries. 

Seriously, almost anything that is on PS4 or XBox One that isn't exclusive is also for PC, so why even buy one of those consoles when a general computer could run them and be useful for far more than gaming? The Wii U at least has exclusives that aren't just highly rated, but they are fun and widely loved by those who play the games.

You can probably use the great scores that Wii U games have been getting to back up some of your arguments.  




 I think another idea would be that pressing L + R + Z while hovering over a name would open the controls for that tag. And if you just press Z, it can toggle tap jump. Faster way to access controls. Would definitely save time in the long run.  




 I stopped after the first paragraph. Couldn't take it seriously.  




 That would only work for people who have tap jump off with no other custom controls. Also, it cannot be chosen by multiple people  which easily becomes a problem.  




 Antivirus isn't a big issue. Some people install it just for safe measure. I sometimes install one temporarily just to make sure I'm not spreading windows viruses to my friends. 

For the first time on a battery's usage, it is good for the battery to be fully drained, then fully charged without being used. After doing this two or three times, it is pretty safe for the battery to charge and use whenever. Constantly using the battery isn't horrendously bad for it, but constantly turning it on or off or plugging and unplugging a charger could take a toll on the battery life. It's not constant use that takes a toll but constant change in which way the power is flowing to or from the battery.  




 Nobody is even going to read the post unless it is properly formatted.  




 I'm not counting on Nintendo actually going through with putting emulators on mobile phones. They probably just want to make sure they can get anybody else who does it to stop by threatening a lawsuit.  









 I'm willing to go as low as 21. 




 I'll admit, I'm curious as to how Sonic would turn out if transferred whole-heartedly to Nintendo's methods and staff. 




 I went on ebay and matched the lowest prices

* Gaia Dragon $8.00
* Star Eater $5.95
* Baxia $3.50
* Blade Armor Ninja $1.36
* Crane Crane $1.00
* Kerykeion $1.63
* 2 Summoner Monk $1.87 each

The total technically comes out to $25.18. But, hell, it's the Christmas Season, and I need to sell soon. How does $23.00 sound for the lot? 




 If you use a USB loader, make sure you update the code file that the USB loader uses. The launcher will not update that for you.  




 I think either one would be a good machine. The air is definitely more of a first time buyer kind of thing, but the Pro would be more future proof and have more I/O. And since you plan on playing WOW and using it for school, I think the extra i/o and bit more juice behind it might be much more worth it in the longer run.  




 Three things

* That's genius
* That's Devious
* That's awesome! 




 Memes with typos shouldn't get upvotes.

 I felt it would have been fine to just need up the cool-down time on the teleport so teleport - attack isn't so fast as to catch people off guard. 




 Is thee anything else you can take off my hands? Either for a friend or as trade-bait? 




 Dude, I seriousely fucking doubt she *only* uses it for email. 




 When are people going to realize that Black Friday deals happen because they ship crappy , malfunctioning, or ill-built devices to be sold for Black Friday. Manufactures literally stow the shit away so they can make profit from it.

Good stuff isn't cheap.  
Cheap stuff isn't good. 




 If that's a strain on the network, then American companies seriously need some freakin updates. Other countries have better networks than we do at half the price. And somehow, everyone seems to be dodging that fact to make sure American providers get what they want. 




 I have a Cyber Dragon Deck which I'm taking apart and selling. I really need the money right now as I struggle to find a job and pay college loans.

I'm not leaving the game by any means (I'm using a budget deck right now). I'm moving on to a different deck after Cyber Dragons anyways.

I'll accept reasonable offers on big bundles. I have a few more cards to sell that I will be putting here at a later time.

In the mean time, [Here's a link](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs) to what's for sale. Just ask about price/rarity.

I'm not trading, nor can I buy right now.

 If it was an option to move them to the bottom, that'd seem pretty okay.

But, there are things that pop up in certain apps that would intrude on pressing buttons at the bottom which would be a problem. 




 Seriously, sometimes I wish a Pokemon game would just Bomb so Nintendo would at least consider stopping it. I think we have plenty of Pokemon games. More than enough to satisfy. My friend Dicen plays during all of his free time and still wasn't even half done with X or Y. (Obviously he beat the game, but he hadn't done everything he wanted to do with them.)

It seems like Nintendo depends on this franchise to take in money while they continue to freely risk failure in many other pursuits. At its bare bones, Pokemon is the definition of the same game over and over. It's truly different than any other RPG due to team building and competitive aspects, but there are enough Pikemon games for us to be entertained for years to come. Can they please not release one or even think about announcing one until 2016? 




 Two movies or three-four episodes of a tv show, there ARE people who do this. We use our devices more than we think. 




 How much more to I need to cut it? One person on this thread stated he easily hits 700GB each month. How it purposing a 2TB extreme for heavy Internet users insane? Whether it's 400GB over or 1TB over, it's an ugly number that users should not have to pay for because one company insisted we'll love being told how much we can use our internet. 




 I did the math for this.

 Let me just start off that nobody will be constantly clicking links for a full 30 month day. Take into account that we spend 1/3 of our lives asleep. That's shortens it to 20 days (480 hours, 28,800 minutes, 1,728,000 seconds) which accounts for 10.8 million megabytes. That's about 10,800 Gigabytes. Now, if that's from one device from one person who also spends half of his awake time away at a job, that cuts it to 5,400GB. Now let's say he only spends half of his home time clicking links (and keeping the line busy). That's down to 2,700GB. I've cut it time after time after time.

 Shoot, far over the 300GB cap that Comcast insists that we will love and I've made some generous deductions. And, by OP's overage fees, that's 48 fees equating to $480 just to use internet how we've always been using it.

TL:DR, average person watching a few movies on Netflix every day, surfing the web now and then, and doing the occasional download could easily take a terabyte in less than a month. 




 I did the math accounting for sleep time and a 9-5 job. It still comes around to about 5 terabytes of data usage if you're always on the internet at home. That's just one person. Obviously homes that make constant use of streaming services or have multiple people with multiple devices could get a a lot higher. 




 From my own comment:

Assuming sleep time and a 9-5 job, that's 8 hours at home using the network. We'll also assume it's in constant use at full potential. That's 1,440,000 megabits per day, divide by 8 for megabytes which is 180,000 megabytes per day. Multiply that by 30 days for 5.4 million megabytes or 5,400 gigabytes. That's 18x the cap that Comcasts assume you'll love. I could understand a 5,000 gigabyte cap, but not a miserable 300.

That's not as bad as a friend I know. The only service is AT T. Because of that, AT T will only offer them up to 6mbps. And they were capped at 80GB for the month. But, they also had the option to remove the cap... by signing up for the business plan for almost twice as much with no speed increase.

How the fuck is this legal?

Internet should be just internet. Shouldn't have to pay to be faster. It isn't like service providers build all of these websites and upgrade/maintain the servers for all of these sites. They just give us access to wires and tubes. Why should we be charged so much for that?

After all, I don't have to pay extra just to use LTE on my phone. If my phone has LTE, god dammit, it will use LTE. The provider never throttles my speed just because I don't pay for it. For fuck's sake, it's purely based on usage. And it's because they're pretty much forced to treat my data as only data, not data moving at a certain speed. 




 "None of my business" states a few dodgy facts.

"that's just my opinion" obviously is about someone opinion about an observation.

Similar, Yes. Ripoff, No. 




 I might just employ you to make an 'add-on' for my custom build. I wouldn't feel like going through all this. 




 Amusing yes. Still, a business card shouldn't abbreviate what the person's title is unless the abbreviation is widely known. I can't think of any right now. Maybe it's just me because I work in visual communications. (Notice, I didn't abbreviate it to viscom like some of my peers insist on doing.) 




 **Quick-Compose**. A button in notification center or control center that allows you to choose recipients, then compose a message to them and send it without opening the messages app. As it stands right now, you need an "unread" message from someone you want to send a message to just to start a quick-compose.

**Rebindable buttons** on the bottom row of Control Center. Seriously, not everyone uses calculator, camera, or clock more than any other apps. Saying that we do when we know we don't kind of sucks. I mean, it's a phone. Wouldn't messages and phone app make sense there?

**Safari Search**. Why can we still not search for a word on a page on our mobile phones? If you're at the top of the page, it could be as simple as pulling the page down to reveal a search bar. Enter what you want to find, then have a list of matches pop up.

**Hide apps**. We all have those apps we don't want to see. If we hit that (X) on a default app, it should ask if we want to "hide" the app. Then, if we need it later, it can be unhidden using the settings.

**Nested Folders**. Users can handle it. I guarantee it.

And for Apple to **STOP INSISTING THAT TRANSLUCENCY MAKES FLAT DESIGN 'GOOD' BY DEFAULT**. By god, I can't stand so many parts in iOS 7+ and the new OS X because of their fucking indulgence in translucency like it's free candy. 




 Step 1: Download Netflix (with this feature)

Step 2: Jailbreak phone

Step 3: Download movie to offline queue

Step 4: Transfer movie file from phone to computer

Step 5: repeat steps 3 and 4.

Step 6: ???

Step 7: Eat a cookie 




 Just don't put the acronym on the card. Spell it out. This will allow more people to easily know who you are and those who point it out are likely too immature to be worth your time. 




 I was probably going to do my own version of the announcer. So if anybody likes it, I volunteer. 




 What did they expect? They launched it too many months after it's other versions. MONTHS after the other versions. This coming from the scumbag company that thought Raymand Legends should be released on all platforms at the same time.

* The hype already died
* Everyone already thought the game was terrible
* This was the last version to be released
* The DLC allegedly wasn't coming to this port

Ubisoft was great up until the 8th generation. Now they're nothing more than another scumbag game developer. 




 I'm hoping they can fix a problem I'm having. Every time I open Safari or Youtube, it feels the need to tell me that Cellular data cannot be used with the app and I can change it in settings. Even if I'm on Wifi, it feels the f *(ing need to tell me this. And I don't have the option to turn these alerts off.

If anyone knows what I'm talking about, make sure to log this complaint as well. 




 Smash. 




 Yes it is. It was pretty much doomed to be that way. This is the first mobile OS apple made that allowed apps to talk to each other and use each other. Not to mention, they just added so darn much to the inner workings of this thing. And it pretty much supported more devices than any iOS before it. Especially all of the features that are dependent on communication with other apps and/or devices.

Yeah, I'm a little down that safari crashes more often that it used to (not like I should be browsing that much on my phone anyway). I'm also a little bummed that airplay or airdrop simply don't see other devices with these enabled sometimes. Such a shame. I'm also disappointed that the wifi simply cuts out sometimes in places where it didn't before iOS 8.

Nevertheless, the least we can do to help is go to Apple's feedback page and leave feeedback. Don't sit here complaining fruitlessly if you have an issue. Report everything to Apple. They need to hear the same complaints over and over from different users so they know that each issue IS an actual issue. 




 The subject of the speech is about feeling like an outcast. The people that pay me prevent me from saying too much since I can't risk giving away the entire lecture. But, it has to do with my life story being more relocatable to others' lives than they really think. I start with turning "everyone's unique" into a double edge sword.

Sometimes I second-guess my own lectures and life seeing how ending up about as alone as a person can get isn't exactly relate-able to the entire human population. Especially because hardly anyone else just happened to meet a girl who was pregnant with four kids. I haven't met a single other person whose even started dating a girl who just happened to be pregnant with one child, let alone four. 




 My name is Blaine. Well, I have my next motivation speech in just a few days and I honestly don't know how I'm going to handle it. I want to just dump the script and leave all my thoughts and feelings on random strangers, but I'm not sure what good that will do.

My mom passed away about a month ago leaving half of her money and property to me and the other half to my younger sister. I gave half of my half to my younger sister since she definitely needs it more than I do. I thought that before my ex-girlfriend, Winter, broke up with me a week later. She says she didn't fall out of love with me, but that she realized she only ever loved what I did for her.

My friend Luke just broke up with his girlfriend too. Although, for them, it was a clean break. They agreed that they were going different ways and decided to break it off. And now, he's moving to New York to seek a career playing brass instruments live for plays. Good for him.

I would have started this AMA sooner had I not been in tears last night. I was simply too emotional to care.

I hope I don't look like I'm dumping my entire agenda on you. I just need to get out these feelings so they don't come out during my job. 




 Sure, Google, Youtube, and Netflix may be able to afford fastlanes since they make a lot of money. But, there are many sights that run out of their owner's pocket or by visitor support. So if you frequently visit those sights that cannot afford to use Comcast's or Verizon's "fast lanes", then there'd be no point in paying for high-speed internet since everything would run at the throttled speed Comcast or Verizon would want them to run at.

And that is a load of bullshit.

P.S. My dad has a business of selling his own original spice blends online. He'll NEVER be able to afford internet fast-lanes. But if Comcast or Verizon want to throttle his website to 1mbps because he can't pay up, nobody would ever find it reasonable to buy from him due to how slowly his sight would load. 





























 Will replays work?

Seriously, that would be the best thing evar!!! 









 Yes, we all have our custom builds and what-not, but lets be mindful to what vanilla 3.5 will have to offer. I feel like we can never truly appreciate what the PMDT went through and especially what they put into the look and feel of each aesthetic change unless we take just an hour or two to play the mod without any of our arbitrary changes.

By the way, you can all expect my custom build in January. My friends and I (along with feedback from my previous builds) will be working hard on it once we've truly enjoyed this new taste of PM. 









 Mr Krabs has let Spongebob use Krabs's bank card, so they definitely exist. But not used at the Krusty Krab. 














 Is Apple trying to tell us they don't want feedback? Take a look at [this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/3i2vSMn.png). I was trying to submit feedback to apple. I even read their policy on unsolicited ideas like they asked and found the submit page again. Still, there seems to be no sign of a submit button anywhere.

This is a real problem. iOS 8 has bugs and users have feedback, but it seems Apple simply doesn't want to hear it.

 (Names have been changed to protect the innocent)

So, a short while ago I received two notes on my apartment door. One was from the apartment staff telling my (former) roommate and I that the keys and electronics were stolen from the office and that they would replace everything including the locks. After my lock was replaced, we got another note on our door that said "try again". This was was hand-written. After that, I replaced the lock myself with my own lock and installed a latch lock as well. While on skype with a potential roommate a few days later, I noticed a draft I did not make in my email account that also said "try again".

My old roommate just moved out yesterday into his girlfriend's house. Lucky him, he has someone else to move in with. He admitted that the notes we received taped to our door both spooked him and made him fear for his stuff. Yeah, his stuff. He doesn't want his stuff to be stolen. That's his biggest concern. While he was packing up yesterday morning with his girlfriend, I begged them to move quickly since I had a potential roommate to interview later. I was busy calling the apartment staff to get him off the lease since he failed to do it before-hand when it should have been his responsibility. Again, I got a lot of back-talk from the staff. This time I was accused of trying to lower the rent a week before rent is due. They didn't notice that rent is over 12 days away, plenty of days over a week.

Other long story short, he tried to take my 42" flat-screen with him that I had payed for. He was yelling and acting as if he was going to take a swing at me. Thank my lucky stars he didn't. He left bitching and screaming about how I was too cheap to buy my own TV. Yes, he's one of those guys, and I'm fucking glad he's moving out now.

Eric, my new potential roommate, arrived plenty after the other guy was done moving out. Another lucky break. After he was done apologizing for being late I had to tell him it was actually very fortunate. So, first I got his permission to record the interview so I can look back and review it later. He agreed. I took the time to transcribe the interview. Here it is for you guys:

---

**Me:** So, let's start first with something important.

**Eric:** Okay.

**Me:** How soon can you move in?

**Eric:** (slight groan)

**Me:** No rush or anything, It's just that rent is due in just under two weeks and I can take a lot of it, but I can't handle it all.

**Eric:** It's not a big deal. I've been looking to move out for a while, as soon as possible actually. I had a few other people ask me, but they later decided their girlfriend, boyfriend, or who the fuck ever was more important.

**Me:** I understand that. So what are some things you'll be up to if you move in?

**Eric:** Other than work, I'll mostly just be playing music and video games. Maybe invite a friend over every once in a while.

**Me:** Just to let you know, if you're going to do anything sexual just keep it to yourself or make sure I'm going to be out-

**Eric:** Oh no, you don't have to worry about that. I don't have a girlfriend or anything. I don't even want to get married, like, ever, dude.

**Me:** Oh, of course, but some people just like to pair up and do whatever.

**Eric:** Oh, you're talking about swinger people, I get ya.

**Me:** It's whatever, don't worry about it.

**Eric:** Yeah, most people don't like hearing that I don't want a relationship.

**Me:** How come?

**Eric:** Everyone wants me to have someone to keep me out of the house or a reason to move out when I want or some other bullshit reason. I just want to enjoy life alone, really. I'm not working on getting a girlfriend just to move out, and I don't need a house. A house is for families.

**Me:** I've never actually heard that logic before.

**Eric:** What logic?

**Me:** Houses are for families, because a lot of people dream of owning a house just for the space.

**Eric:** How much space does one person need? A room and a kitchen, that's it.

**Me:** Cool. So, you said on skype that you like loud rock music. What sort of bands would you be-

**Eric:** Oh, the greats. You know, like: The Beetles; Jimmy Hendrix; Joe Satriani; bit of Coldplay here and there. And I know most people hate them, but a hint of Nickelback every so often.

**Me:** Eh, I don't think they're that bad. 

**Eric:** Oh, wonderful.

**Me:** Just keep in mind, these are apartments. So, after dark, keep it quiet.

**Eric:** Oh of course, last thing I need is to be kicked out and live like a homeless fuck, ya-know?

**Me:** Don't let the friends of homeless here you on that, they might take offense to that.

**Eric:** Oh, I'm sorry, was that over the line?

**Me:** Not for me, just be respectful while you're here.

**Eric:** Oh, question?

**Me:** Shoot.

**Eric:** Is the pool here free of charge?

**Me:** Yeah, you just need a key. I never use the pool, so I don't know how good it is, how deep it is, I've never looked.

**Eric:** That's not a problem.

**Me:** Any more questions you have for me?

**Eric:** Ummmm, hmm (Long pause). Would you be cool with me moving in this weekend?

**Me:** If that's how it has to be, then fine. I can't guarantee anything though.

**Eric:** Perfectly understandable.

---

After that, we got up, shook hands, and he left (but not without offering to take me out for a drink). I cannot wrap my head around this guy. Whether he was trying his hardest to impress or not, the "too good to be true" regime kept my heart pounding. I kept waiting for him to say something suspicious, or even "try again". I was tempted to bring it up, but if he really was anything to worry about, it may have set him off and put me in more danger.

I think I'll let him move in at least on a trial basis. I searched my apartment this morning for anything suspicious or anything missing. Nothing seemed particularly wrong until I saw that the latch wasn't.. well, latched. I couldn't remember if I had locked it up or not before I went to bed. The other lock was still locked, but that couldn't really indicate anything. After doing a second inspection of the apartment, I continued not to find anything.

I have my email open right now so I can email Eric. The draft is gone. I deleted it, and it hasn't come back. I'm worried about if I'm even going to be able to sleep tonight.

If anyone has any thoughts on this interview or something that could help me sleep, that would be wonderful. I really just need to talk to a few more sane people. 




 Okay, two points to make off the top:

1. Yes this is a fun deck

2. I still want this deck to be as good as it can be

This is why I'm here.  I've been working on this experiment for a bit over a format's time. It's held up pretty well to many modern decks.

I'm willing to spend as much time as necessary to complete this deck since my Cyber Dragons are done outside of a Foolish Burial. Now for the cards.

---

**Monsters** (25)

* 3 Hazy Flame Hydra
* 3 Hazy Flame Cerberus
* 3 Hazy Flame Peryton
* 3 Swap Frog
* 3 Treeborn Frog
* 2 Ronintoadin

Here is the core. 3 Hydra keeps Peryton - Solda plays as live as possible. This keeps drawing 1 Peryton and 1 Hydra from being a problem. Odly enough, I don't feel that Hazy filled hands are dead since Cerbereus can be used to float itself and other Hazies out of the deck. Just one frog is enough to get this going since Swap Frog puts Treeborn in the grave, Treeborn dying puts Treeborn in the Grave, and Ronin has a big defensive butt.

* 3 Battle Fader
* 1 Gorz, the Emissary of Darkness

Two points to these. First one is to stall. The other one is to give me something to tribute for a Hazy Flame.

* 2 Maxx "C"
* 2 Effect Veiler

Very good hand traps. Not sure about veilers lately. Maxx "C" is a double for stall and drawing. This deck needs to draw. Veiler helps handle my opponent's monster effects on their turn. Breakthrough Skill wasn't quite usable in this deck.

**Spells** (15)

* 3 Upstart Goblin

This decks needs to draw

* 2 Mystical Space Typhoon
* 2 Forbidden Lance

A good amount of back-row hate/protection without clogging up so bad that I cannot start my combos.

* 3 Enemy Controller

Paired with Treeborn Frog, I can take my opponent's monsters to use as I please.

* 2 Soul Exchange

Tribute my opponent's monsters for my many monsters I can tribute summon. Huge drawback is no battle phase. Not too much better than Soul Charge when you think about it. Tributing my opponent's problem monsters is sometimes the best way to get rid of them. Soul Charge cannot do that.

* 2 Creature Swap

Major troll card. I love using this to exchange my little Treeborn Frog for my opponent's lone beater. And it's for keeps too.

* 1 Rekindling

Ironically incredible in this deck. Even at first turn, Peryton and Cerbereus put in the work to dump Rekindling fodder into the Graveyard.

**Extra Deck** (11 Xyz, 4 Synchro)

* 2 Slacker Magician
* 1 Gachi Gachi Gantetsu

These are pretty good stall cards. As well, Gachi can boost my already big monsters to even bigger. Even brings Hydra to 2700 which is enough to beat over an Ophion. Yes, I've done it before.

* 1 Daigusto Phoenix

Can attack twice or allow Gaia Dragon the Thunder Charger to attack twice. Either way, a valuable asset to have and is very easy to make.

* 3 Hazy Flame Basiltrice

Didn't you read the core of the deck? You don't just run Hazy Flames and not run at least two of these. Two of them are often delt with easily since not all Basiltrice's have 5 Materials. But when one's in the Grave and you use Hydras to Xyz summon, you can attach some basiltrice to your Xyz monster.

* 2 Evolzar Solda

In a way, this is my Vanity's Emptiness. This deck absolutely lost to my friend's Gladiator Beasts until I finally got a hold of a physical copy of this card. Damn was Ren so goddamn mad that he couldn't deal with this card. He couldn't keep a Gladiator beast on the board long enough.

* 1 Constellar Ptolemy M7

Not only putting my girlfriend's gift to me to work, but is stupid use for those monsters who "cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects." I'm looking at you, beelze.

* 1 Gaia Dragon the Thunder Charger

For those pesky defense position monsters trying to protect those lifepoints that I want to destroy oh so much. Paired with Daigusto Phoenix, this card can be pretty darn useful. Especially when any of my Xyz monsters run out of material (heaven forbid).

* 1 Formula Synchron

The deck needs to draw

* 1 Black Rose Dragon

Awesome Field Wiping Ability

* 1 Stardust Dragon

Decent Protection

* 1 Scrap Dragon

Pair this with that Treeborn frog that just keeps coming back for hilarity. Not to mention, choose your targets, then chain Enemy Controller to deal with 2 of your opponent's cards at once.

---

I love my Hazy Flames. And I really love Hydra. I really love being able to use my collection and showing off what they can do. And this is hands down the most consistent build I've ever come up with. I no longer lose to that oh so common MST destroying a Hazy Pillar. Hazy Pillar is temporary, but Treeborn frog is practically forever.

I just feel that this has room for improvement. So help me with this experiment. 




 In case you haven't already heard, after my apartments having their keys stolen and having to replace the locks, I received a handwritten note scotch taped to my door saying "try again".

For those of you who don't know (long story short), this is what the first letter from the apartments said:

 At some time after 1:00pm on Monday, the... office was broken into. Computers, monitors, and phones were stolen. Also taken were some of the apartment keys. The good news is that all keys are on a key tracking system and none of the keys have actual apartment numbers on them.

 We are telling you this so you can be extra cautious and if you see any unusual activity, please dial 911. Additionally, we will have extended ours for our courtesy patrol.

 That being said we are implementing a new key system and will be installing brand new apartment locks as well as new mailbox locks. This project will begin on Wednesday.

That note was stuck to the door with two pieces of duct tape like the apartment staff always does. But the handwritten "try again" note was attached with scotch tape.

---

Thanks to suggestions from the /r/nosleep community, I was doing well to feel safer. My apartment complex didn't want me changing the locks to the front door because they have their keys on a system and they would need to be able to get in if I moved out. I thought it was complete crap and stated again that I was being targeted by someone or something, and they dismissed it. One lady even accused me of making the whole thing up.

I changed the locks anyways. I also installed a latch. I have the only key. My roommate couldn't care less since he's home all the time lately. A different long story short: he lost his job and he is planning to move in with his girlfriend next month.

Now I've been looking for a new roommate. I'm hesitant to invite anyone in given that I have no idea who could have left the note or why they even left the note in the first place. I'm still hoping someone will surprise me on live TV telling me it was all a prank. (Right, a harmless prank that cost me roughly 50 dollars is new locks, 30 minutes of installation time, and many nights of sleep.)

For the past few days, I've been emailing my friends, family, employer, anyone I can think of about my situation and need for a roommate that could pay his end of the rent next month.

One seemingly trustworthy person has contacted me for a roommate interview which will be tomorrow. We chatted over Skype the past three days and he seems like an okay guy. He's roughly my height with a beard, likes action movies, and loud rock music as far as I've heard from him so far. He even promised to keep the music down or use headphones when I'm home.

After we set up the meeting, I wanted to email him directions to the place. I had one tab open with google maps and one tab open with my email. Between switching tabs to grab directions, the number of drafts I had went from zero to one. That's right, I was looking at my email tab which had 0 drafts, and after looking at the google maps tab and heading back over, the number of drafts went to 1. This was bizarre.

Quick gmail tip, Gmail automatically saves a newly started email as a draft, but not until a few moments after you opened it. I didn't have compose new email window open yet, but somehow I had a draft.

The draft had no recipients and said "try again". 




 So here's the rule:

* If you Special Summon a monster, it cannot attack that turn unless it is an Xyz, Synchro, or Fusion Monster. 




 Let me give you an example of *that* guy.

I have a co-player at my locals who also happens to be a vendor worker at Frank and Sons. Translated, he thinks he can get away with vendor pricing while he himself is a customer. Most he would pay me for a Wiretap or Breakthrough Skill is $2. Why? Because he buys them for $2 while he's working at Frank and Sons. When I pulled a Dracossack from a tin, he was trying to get it from me for less than $15 (trades or cash, doesn't matter, makes no difference to him.) I just don't see how he would value my freshly pulled card for half of what he would value it at if it were his.

I respect that he is a vendor, but while he is at locals, he doesn't work for the card shop nor is his own shop even open.

Is it really fair for him to expect people to put up with this? Or should he cut the bullshit and act like a customer like the rest of us there?

So what person at locals do you have that's "that guy". 




 We all cancel, learn to live without internet for a few weeks (or just tether onto our phones which may even be cheaper), and they all tumble down and are forced to be fair. Too bad we're all too dependent on the Internet (myself included) to be able to do this. 




 Seriously, this should be a fucking default. This could be the funniest and most random subreddit ever.

Poodles are also stupid as fuck, just saying. 









 I am hoping to get some inexpensive samples from Delano. I'm strongly considering them as the manufacturer. If I do get samples, I'll have concrete game pieces to use to demonstrate the game in a proper "How To Play" explanation video.

Keep your fingers crossed. 









 I made this mat with this image for a friend. I had to remove a lot of big lettering but decided to keep the letters saying Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack. Also, I put a Big-Eye in the reflection of Dracossack's eye and branded the Dracossack making it personal for him.

The picture ended up being very small, and John wanted a border around it, so I quickly put in a sloppy metal-and-bolts border. He's not going to be too picky. It was partly to keep the image small enough to that the quality wouldn't be completely shot.

Note: I misplaced an eyebrow and blurred the name to make using this for yourself a hassle.

 I received a production quote from http://www.delanoservice.com/. I had quotes for 500, 1500, 2500, and 5000 cards. This would equate to anywhere from 10 to 108 starter decks. That's not a lot, but it still costs quite a pretty penny. Here's what the numbers look like

| Quantity | Cost |
|----:|:-------------|
| 500 | $4,050 |
| 1500 | $5,025 |
| 2500 | $6,219 |
| 5000 | $7,913 |

Hardly seems worth the money we might put into it. But, here's the kicker. This is quantity per deck. After other costs, I'm told that production would equate to around $3 per deck. Here is what they had to say:

 This price does not include shipping of the product or proofs, storage and/or fulfillment, or costs related due to changes in the art or product specifications. Industry standard overrun is 10% of the total ordered. Shipping costs, overruns and any other fees will be invoiced once production is complete. (Shipping is invoiced separately after DeLano Service is billed by the shipping company).

**This is difficult**

I am still in touch with the manufacturer hoping they can help me crush more numbers.. I'll keep you updated. 









 I have French lances, and I would love to get more French cards, especially in halo. Mega-tin seems like a good way to do this. Any way I can get one for a reasonable price?

 **Apologies**

I am extremely sorry that I have not been able to set up users lately. I will get to them later today. If in a few days you set up a thread but still do not have flair or a link on the list of traders, then PM me with the link to your feedback thread.

**Update**

I believe I am caught up in setting up and updating feedback threads. If I didn't set you up, it is because there is one or more problems with the feedback thread. I will have alerted any users of these problems. Just set up a new thread and this time, read all of the instructions and follow them correctly.

**Please read before setting up**

[Rules and Regulations V3 - READ BEFORE SUBMITTING](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOFeedback/comments/20dtie/rules_and_regulations_v3_read_before_submitting/) 




 So we've all seen that "balance a card you think is OP" post. Let's do something a bit different. Take those cards that you have all the goddamn salt in the world for and obliterate them. Or change them suddenly. You can give Change of Heart an effect where your opponent gains a token if you want. I really don't care.

LET THE SALT RUN FREE! 




 Restricting cards is a diverse topic and one we haven't spent much time discussing. We are 0% sure what we are going to do with this. My team often doesn't see themselves as a part of creating the game even though I've tried to make them feel like co-creators or co-handlers of the game. So, I'm looking deeply for feedback. Keep in mind that we may test any of these out at any given time.

**Restrictions**

Default card limits have been at two, four, and three. I even once had a system where characters were limited to four and items were limited to two. At that time, the way items worked was pretty game-breaking. Yet again, that was also a time when items could be picked up on the field and cards had/used up to 4 slots. (The game also had a rank-up system, but I won't go into that.)

Now, the limit for any card in the deck is at 5. This means that with a 45 card deck and a commander, you will have at least 10 different cards. The main deck can be made up of 5 copies each of 9 different cards. The 10th card comes from the commander. This partially came from rushing out test decks. It ended up being a good system, although in the future, we may bring it down to 4 if we feel the desire for more diverse decks or if interested parties show a demand.

Commanders are strictly limited to existing only in the commander position (stacked on top of the Life Pile). Despite being a type of character, commanders will never be allowed in the main deck. *Note: Commanders are allowed to be changed between games. I will cover this more in the rules as the develop.*

**Artificial Restrictions**

There are a few options we could do here. The first list of options is assuming the default limit for any card (outside of commanders) is 5.

* Option 1: Have 6 levels of restrictions. In this plan, a card may be artificially restricted to 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The default limit remains at 5 for cards without these restrictions.

* Option 2: Have 4 levels of restrictions. In this plan, a card may be artificially restricted to 0, 1, or 3. The default limit remains at 5 for cards without these restrictions.

* Option 3: Either a card is banned or it isn't.

This second list of options is assuming the default limit for any card (outside of commanders) is 4.

* Option 1: Have 5 levels of restrictions. In this plan, a card may be artificially restricted to 0, 1, 2, or 3. The default limit remains at 4 for cards without these restrictions.

* Option 2: Have 3 levels of restriction. In this plan, a card may be artificially restricted to 0 or 2. The default limit remains at 4 for cards without these restrictions.

* Option 3: Either a card is banned or it isn't.

**Notes**

Of course, any players picking it up without tournament play in mind can play however they want. We don't intend on limiting anything for casual play that disregards tournament regulation. Reason: It's impossible. Players will end up playing how they want to play and we have no problem with them having fun.

**Feedback**

Please tell us which of these options is most appealing to you. This will help us finish up the planning for our first starter decks. 









 **Card games... they have their qwircks**

In all honesty... we don't have any definite plans since we are still pursuing the right manufacturer. I will depend on their capabilities combined with out designs and ideas. But, the topic has been brought up among the team (by me, admittedly) that the games will never be 100% balanced unless every player had access to any card they wanted. And, as time goes on, creating more and more cards would just upset any balances previously put into place.

I say "good". We never intended this to be 100% balanced. Chance is going to take place on and off the battlefield. I have recently started watching a series on the science of good and bad elements in gaming and came across [this very good explanation on the effect of chance in competitive games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9ZI9kMsvRQ). Yes, it talks mainly about e-sports and video games, but it applies fully for trading card games as well. We're not going to be able to completely take out the random factors in the game. Not unless we can let you choose what card you draw each turn which simply wouldn't be healthy for any TCG.

To set up an example, when I was playing Yugioh on Duelingnetwork.com a few days ago, I came across a situation where I had 1 card in my hand that would allow me to win as long as I drew a Spell Card. That's exactly what I did. But, would I have won without that chance? the chance would have fallen to near 0 for most other possibilities. These situations are hard to control, and we have no interest in drawing from these experiences to influence our card design.

There are factors we can control and have interest in controlling. In Magic: The Gathering, there are over 200 possible cards you can receive from a core set. In Yugioh, sets range from 100 to 300 cards. Most sets are 99 cards. They even take it a step further in making many cards hard to get. In MTG, you may find it hard to come by a card you need if it's a mythic rare. In Yugioh, the same applies to secret rare, ultimate rare, and ghost rare. These drive up prices for a lot of these cards putting skilled, yet poorer, contestants at a disadvantage.

**So what do we plan to do about this?**

Well, one thing We've decided to do is lower the set amounts. We're not interested in bulking out 100 card sets multiple times a year with little opportunity for re-prints in the future. We think 80 is a reasonable number to keep sets minimal but somewhat profitable. Please understand that without profit, this game would fail. Some cards will be more rare than others, but these will likely be key cards and commanders that make some decks work.

But, what about reprints for those who cannot afford the first print? I myself am not a fan of that. After waiting months for Constellar Ptolemy M7 (Yugioh Card) to become affordable again, I finally got a hold of a key component of one of my decks. It felt good. The poor players with patients should be rewarded. I know many Yugioh players are still waiting for Evilswarm Exciton Knight to be less than 60 dollars to purchase reasonable. 60 dollars. That's the price of a modern video game (or a very rare retro video game).

To keep that price cap, we may occasionally release sets that simply aim to control costs of absurdly expensive cards. Especially cards we might not be printing any more.

Keep in mind that these plans are not set in stone. We still want to see how many cards we want in each pack. 8 seems likely, but again, it may not be up to us.

**Feedback is Welcome**

*I'll be continuing to make these posts so long as I have something to talk about. Please be sure to ask questions and leave feedback and suggestions.* 




 **Our goal for balance**

We've studied other card games to see how balance is handled. What we concluded is that we couldn't exactly conclude anything. All of these other games (Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic: The Gathering, Cardfight Vanguard, My Little Pony CCG, etc.) seemed to have their guidelines change for what is balanced and healthy for the game over time.

So we are not aiming for an environment that is inherently perfectly balanced: Instead, we're aiming for the same asymmetrical aspects of the game that keep all other TCGs fun. However, we still want to keep every deck playable and fun for each player that decides to play them.

Yes, there will definitely be intentional imbalances between decks. This shouldn't come from one deck simply having better tools and statistics but from certain decks having tools that counteract other parts of the game.

**Guidelines for creating cards**

Each of these guidelines will be tested and adjusted and even disobeyed on a card-by-card or a deck-by-deck basis. These are just some of the guidelines that we have come up with to keep anything from starting out over-powered.

* Nothing is free. Everything that could give the player some sort of advantage should come at some sort of cost to keep anything from being abusable. This hopefully will emphesize a pro-con style of thinking in each turn from the beginning to end of each game.
* Decks should never become too fast without a price. Pretty simply, if a deck becomes too fast in testing, we may weaken some characters or nerf a deck's commander(s) to balance something out.
* Commanders are used as come-back tools, not game-breaking tools. In this aspect, if a leader ever becomes game-breaking, we will try to take away what makes it game-breaking. But if it would would require too much, we may simply ban the commander from play and design a new one that is more balanced for that deck.
* Slots: This was one of the very first things we decided on. We wanted all characters to be useful. More powerful items require more slots, so we restricted them to being used by characters who have less inherent fire-power. Therefore, any character with a trait other than "Normal", or any character with an effect will have only 1 slot. The only exception to this are commanders who will always have 3 slots. Characters with 2 slots will always have a trait of "Normal" with no effect. *Note: Thanks to this, we always do out best to make sure that whatever effect or trait is given to a character makes that effect or trait worth while to the player.*

**Feedback**

These are just a few things that we will be doing to make sure this game is completely fun for everyone. Picking up weaker decks (as long as they are well constructed) shouldn't be a chore or burden but feel more like a challenge. I have been testing with weaker decks letting my opponent use the stronger decks. And the mechanics have proven to reenforce the balance of the game.

If you have any suggestions, questions, or concerns, please post about them here. I'll be trying to post often about what we're doing.

 I run a self.post only subreddit which strictly forbids linking to ebay for sales outside of our ebay thread. I have tried to automatically remove posts with "ebay.com" in the content, but if it's linked [using this method](http://www.reddit.com), automoderator completely skips over it.

I can't remove posts that simply mention ebay because users are constantly messaging me that their posts are removed because they said something like "I sell 10% off ebay's lowest price".

**If this is already possible, someone please make it clear how to do it. I looked in Automods guides and didn't find a fucking thing. To be honest, it doesn't make very much clear for novice users.** 




 [remove this post](http://www.ebay.com) 




 In /r/ygosales, it would be nice if I could have the audomoderator do two things for me.

1. When a post reaches 10 minutes old, if it doesn't have flair, comment on the post "Your post does not have flair. Please add flair to your post."

2. When a post reaches 10 minutes old, if it doesn't have flair, remove the post and message the user, "Your post has been removed because you did not assign flair within the time span allowed. If you cannot assign flair, visit the desktop version of the site."

PLUS: THERE NEEDS TO BE A SIMPLE PAGE EXPLAINING HOW TO WRITE AN EXPRESSION. The guides seem to leave the users to figure it out based on examples. 




 My friend H2Overdrive picked up ice clovers and has pretty much mastered ~~f-throw~~ down-throw dair re-grab to a point where he can carry me across the stage and fair me to death. I really don't know how the hell to get out of it. It makes his climbers unfair to play against. I can't learn the matchup if his character doesn't let me play.

My Main is Ness, and the PK shenanigans are turning out to not be enough. Even my Pit (who is surpassing my Ness if you ask my other smash buddies) is finding this to be a stupidly frustrating matchup.

All of a sudden, I decided to screw around and challenge his climbers with Yoshi; A character I never thought I would pick up. But his climbers became easier to get off the edge and convert to a KO. What the hell?

So in other news:

* Any Yoshi tips?
* What can I do to avoid getting carried to my death by ICs?

EDIT: Downvote hell hu? I thought admitting what I don't know and asking for help would garner some discussion. Guess people just hate me. 




 Please do not use abbreviations unless you have explicitly described in the post what that abbreviation means. They are a pain to everyone who doesn't know what they mean. Even with MST (Mystical Space Typhoon), probably the most known abbreviation in Yu-Gi-Oh!, not everyone automatically knows what it means.

**TL:DR** Spell out your cards' names. 




 Shadolls can kiss my ass. On the bright side, no more drawing on first turn! 




 There's a subreddit where you can complain about anything you want all day and nobody can tell you to stop complaining.

I think everyone should give it a gander. It's called /r/complainaboutanything and there really are no rules as long as your complaining about something and you're not hurting anyone else. 




 I wanted to address the differences in the rules that are enforced here and on YGOBinders. And there's one big difference that has raised a bit of confusion. So let me clear it up.

**YGOSales is a much different subreddit than YGOBinders**

YGOSales is purely for buying and selling to get or get rid of Yu-Gi-Oh! merchandise. Whether it's cards, manga, DVDs, duel disks, even top-loaders. Sales get huge. Listings here go for up to 300 or even 500 dollars with users trying to sell decks. (These are removed due to exceeding the $80 price cap.)

We don't need users frequently arguing over scams because an envelope with 30 or more dollars was lost or even stolen when going through the mail. It happens a lot because, put bluntly, some greedy fucks work there waiting for those envelopes so they can steal for their own gain. YGOSales would be putting money through the mail very frequently if it wasn't for this rule.

**Cards with a dollar or two**

Using a dollar bill or two to even out a trade is not as risky as sending a straight 10 dollars through the mail. It's a reason I hold a preference of NEVER accepting concealed cash as a full payment on YGOBinders. A dollar or two to even out a trade is always okay in my book. Prohibiting concealed cash on YGOBinders would also prohibit this practice, and is rather unfair to those who take part in it.

Of course, tracking and insurance always helps, but is it really worth 10-20 dollars to track and insure sending 20-30 dollars in cold hard cash just to get it through the mail? Even then, if it fails, it was a waste of your money and every user's time.

**Lack of Price Caps**

There's no price cap over on YGOBinders. Why? Because tracking and insuring a deck through parcel mail is far less risky than putting a 20 dollar bill through an envelope. Sending decks has proved far less risky when proper care is taken (bubble mailer and tracking).

Price caps are enforced on YGOSales because buyers and sellers should never have a bad experience because (for whatever god-awful reason) a deck went missing in the mail. Paypal doesn't have a very sophisticated resolution center. Ebay's is far more evolved. That's why we have an Ebay thread which you can access from the header at any time.

Buying from Ebay is far less risky because of their great resolution center.

**Wrap Up**

I hope you enjoyed this quick explanation on why YGOBinders and YGOSales don't share all of the sames rules. Now please, be safe and stay honest.

Here's something unusual. There's a few things I need to make a deck I'm working on playable. It needs testing to be blunt. So here's what I'm looking for:

* 3 Treeborn Frog  
* 3 Swap Frog  
* 1 Roanintoadin  

I would prefer to get all the frogs at once and in good condition.

Here's a couple other things I'll need for the deck:

* 2 Battle Fader
* 1 Evolzar Solda (ultimate rare preferred)  
* 2 Maxx "C"
* 1 creature Swap (ultra to match my current one)

Yes. I know. It's pretty Bizzar. Now this last group is something I was just because bunnies:

* 2 ^Ultra ^Rare Elemental Hero Stratos

 Could there really be a did inutile combination of these? I've tried to do it, but some of this coding and placing and file modding seems to be going over my head.

Someone should release a code set with a set of tools to let us all build cool builds that combine multiples of these. Plus, it would make for some awesome builds and interesting reviews.

Wouldn't you like something like this? 




 Breakthrough skill just got confirmed as a card in the Lightsworn structure deck. Would selling now be worth it? Mine are ultra and ultimate, so 17 and 25. If those fall too much, I'd like to profit from it. 














 Here's a game we do often at /r/Yugioh. We would take a card and add or subtract just a few words from the text to make the card OP.

So I challenge you all, make one minimal change to a character that you think would make that character OP. It could be giving Jogglypuff instant damage-to-zero on every rest or making Ganondorf's warlock punch only take half a second to do. (Nothing like 100% on a move or 15x knock back growth on a move. Those are boring, obvious, and uncreative.)

This will allow us all to see how delicate balancing the game really is and probably even peek into the mind of bored PMBR devs. But moreover, I think this will be fun for everyone. 




 So I was buying Hazy Flame cards on /r/ygosales and wanted to buy any amount of alternate art Hazy Flames. Naturally, I got a response. A bit of negotiating and a few weeks later, HERE THEY ARE!

These are awesome, and at only 5 dollars a card, it felt really good.

Remember, that's sam90fox who made these. 




 I think this imgur album explains the problem:

I got a common5.pac file and started making a lot of changes. All of them going stable and keeping the size small enough so that P:M won't crash. BUT, when I try to replace bg_icon on the stage select screen, it gives me an error. If I try to make another change and save the file, brawlbox crashes without saving and I must make those changes over again.

I'm using brawlbox 0.71 for reference.

I'm trying to replace sc_selmap_en  MiscData[20]  textures  bg_icon 




 **[Project M! 3.02 - My Main Characters ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlezjvo-BXk)**

I have gone on record saying that Ness is my best. But, I wanted the community's opinion. I took the 3 mains I've been putting the most time into, Pokemon Stadium 2, and all three spacies to give you an idea on my skill level with each one.

Each of these are the first and only recording of each set. There weren't any resets to make sure I looked good. All of these sets were played one after the other in the order shown (Lucas, Ness, Pit).

**So I ask**

1. Who is my best character? Lucas, Ness, or Pit?

2. What can I work on across my characters? For each character individually?

Fun fact: I captured the main cap with an iPhone 5s and the face-cam with an iPhone 5. I edited it together entirely on the iPhone 5s using iMovie. 




 I'm buying Hazy Flames, and I'd prefer to buy them at least 4 at a time. I'm willing to pay 50 cents for each card. (35 cents for extra huge bundles.) Here is what I am looking for:

* Any amount of extended art Hazy Flames
* ~~2 Hazy Flame Peryton~~
* ~~5~~ 3 Hazy Flame Hyppogrif
* 16 Hazy Flame Hydra
* ~~5 Hazy Flame Cerbereus~~
* ~~9~~ 3 Hazy Flame Manticore
* ~~7 Hazy Flame Sphynx~~
* ~~9 Hazy Glory~~

 **Brawl Vault Links please**

So I just got a code set and common5 and mu_menumain ready to build a 6 stage expansion. But now the problem is I don't know what I want to add.

So I was wondering what stages the community here likes to use for some good hard Project M goodness. 

^(in case anyone's wondering, I doubt it, these May or May not be part of my next build. And my next music pack is about to start production.)

Thanks everyone. You guys are awesome. And you've helped others find cool balanced-ish stages to add.
