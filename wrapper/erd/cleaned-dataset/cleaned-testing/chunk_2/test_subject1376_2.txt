 I'm not the best at getting my thoughts written down. I thought I made the point that if you have been designing for a while it is part of the natural progression of things, or at least it seems that way for me.

A huge portion of my job recently when developing apps or websites is the UX end of things, and it naturally lead to choosing to do that full time as opposed to just doing it along with developing the UI and actually building it all (html, javascript, Xcode etc).

If your job already has you doing these things, and you enjoy that end of it, then you should consider doing it full time as it is a good way to step into a higher position and make more money. I should have been more clear on that point. I didn't mean to come across as saying you should do UX only for the money, as in my experience that is one of the last reasons to do work. I think I actually had an entire section about doing work you enjoy but my friend who read through the article told my I had too many tangents :) 




 Sorry I've been in the digital end of design for so long now I just assume everyone knows what it is :)

Part of my new years resolution is to "not be such a shitty writer" and I suppose part of that is not making assumptions about the audience. It actually took me most of the day to write this. I didn't know getting my thoughts out on 'paper' was so difficult. 




 It's partly an exaggeration..

I know none of those ask for a decade of experience and a masters degree, but I have seen those posts in the past. I always assume it is just someone in HR posting a bunch of stuff they don't understand.

 I didn't realize cafepress was still around. Maybe take a look at society6, I've been using them for a while for art prints and the quality of their work is pretty great.

 They were tiny wrestlers. I don't remember what they were from or why I had them, but they were awesome and were always in the sandbox with my hotwheels and micro machines. 




 Thats good thats actually what I was drawing. 









 You're right, what was I thinking :( 














 I went from an Intuos3 to a cintiq and I'm happy with the switch. The intuos is a bit faster and more responsive, but I only have a 21UX. I imagine the new 24hd and 24hd touch are better.

I still love drawing on the screen more than on the intuos, but as you said the price jump is pretty significant. 




 You could use [behance.net](http://prosite.com/?utm_source=network utm_medium=footer utm_campaign=network_footer_references), they have a pro site for portfolios.

 We went on vacation to Venice last year and my wife got really annoyed with me pointing out things that were in Assassins Creed.

 Am I the only one who thinks 2.5 hours for each tuesday bombcast isn't nearly enough? 




 It looks good I like the 'Maintained by Urag gro-Shub" at the top. This might help you btw a lot of the crap is edited out and formatted. Also it is just a simple .txt you can do with it what you want.

 Scream my name while pushing. My goal is to have nerds the world over yelling my name while dropping bombs.
