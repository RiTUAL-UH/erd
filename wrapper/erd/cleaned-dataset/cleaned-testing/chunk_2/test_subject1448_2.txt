 Good point, but no one in my family smokes... and that one cigarette had some drawings in it (which my friend had done).

It was, with no doubt, the same cigarette. 




 Yea mate, ain't nobody is american :D 




   Well, so I'm on my class waiting for the last bell rang, so we can go home. My friend, just for fun, puts a cigarette (which is very prohibited in my school) in my ear. I immediately take it off my ear and it falls in the ground.
  But the thing is, we looked down so we can hide the cigarette again, but it completely disappeared. We looked for it for what felt like 15 minutes, looked our backpacks, the ground, everywhere. I even went to the bathroom so I could take my clothes off to see if it fell within me: nothing, the cigarette was gone.  We just accepted it and went home.
  This was 3 days ago. Yesterday, I was using my PC when I noticed, on the top of my desk, the same cigarette that fell on the ground and disappeared. I was like: WTF?!? The first thing I've done was to talk with my parents to see if they found it in my clothes: they didn't. I even talked with my brother who, somehow, could have found it: he didn't. The cigarette just TELEPORTED to the top of my desk (which I am always using) 2 days after he fell into the ground of my class and completely disappeared.

Glitch? Probably.
