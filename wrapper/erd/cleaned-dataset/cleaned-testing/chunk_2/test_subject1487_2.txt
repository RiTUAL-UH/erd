 Pardon me if I'm wrong, I haven't studied Theory intensely in awhile. I believe it's just a color tone, but the bV would make the chord half diminished. You can resolve it the same way you resolve any normal V chord, or use it as the Dominant of a new key.  




 My gf has wanted this since they announced it. 




 This is fantastic! 




 Amazing. 




 Can't explain to you how many times I've done this... 




 This is hilarious. Someone needs to make these an actual thing. Only cereal I'd buy. 




 This sounds like me and my SO, honestly. 




 I almost forgot to mention that I play a few hours out of the week, but that's because I need to stay on top of my schoolwork. It's tough because I can play this game all day long (as I did this last summer when I wasn't working and played this game for 4-8hrs a day every couple of days or so), but there are some points where I need to go do other things and hang out with RL people. 

Speaking of relationships, how goes the positive approach on yours? I hope it's going well.
