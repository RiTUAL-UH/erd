 I think there's like 7 seasons... 




 My mind is blown. 




 construction, delivery men (food and furniture, etc), coutbound/inbound call center or telemarketing. sell drugs, underwear, flip free stuff you see on the side of the road for money, or thrift store flipping /r/flipping 




 I like answering questions too. I love posting here but don't get many questions. How do you relieve stress/anxiety? 




 3. 




 Mturk 




 Fourth wall? 




 Meds. They have me a little clearer view, enabling me to kind of "self help" myself how a therapist may.... If that makes sense.

Hated therapy. 




 3 




 I was obsessed with coffee, stopped drinking it when I started antidepressants and other pills. Sucked but now I don't drink it at all. Maybe once a month. 




 And your favorite? Love(d) opiates. 




 Depression, anxiety, mania. Low social interaction, body issues, abuse, drug use, alcohol use... All at the same time. 




 Not sure if feasible but my high school sells mattresses for their football team. Big profit compared to candy bars. 




 Just cut it out. You can do it and won't miss it.

Healthy eating works too (so I hear). 




 Already on ambien. Tryna get more blown 




 Humans are so unique! Sometimes killers become monsters in our heads . 




 Browse reddit. Search for threads about the zodiac killer. I did that the other day and was so intrigued. I just took an ambien trying to get freaky, I hope I can make it past the drowsiness and join you. I've been up since 4am. 




 Yes. It did result in a relationship which I guess I can't be mad at. He showed me different things and took me on the ride of my life thus far, even though we never really "dated."

Gut feelings hold a lot of importance. 




 I'm very sorry for the deaths in your family. It's hard but what a blessing to have had them in your life, to make it more beautiful.

It's reddit, time to spill how you messed up. I've been through a lot and I'm not one for preaching, but I do enjoy telling others my experiences and how I look at different situations. 




 No that's rude as fuck and weird. Seems like she's using you and you're better than that. Sorry. Just an outsiders view. 




 At least you can feel feelings. Even when I'm ecstatic, I'm not "high." 

Ask her out and be a 27 mature kind gentleman and get some ice cream in the park over homemade sandwiches and a picnic basket. 




 Happy birthday, very exciting but be careful. Welcome to the 21 club, friend. You made it 21 years ;)

 You're in your 30s and live right in the middle of white collar and blue collar. You probably have one kid that you want to be a rock star. And a gotee 




 You smoke weed but don't do much more, yet you live a respectable life as a productive human being and are empathetic and compassionate to others.  




 Veggie burgers. 




 Do you have a dog? Take them to a class or day care and after, talk with the teacher or whatever and ask them to teach you.  




 College isn't worth it but having a degree is.

Learning is worth it. 




 Work hard and be nice to people.

My old boss (who was more like a parental figure) used to tell me "everyone has their problems." Not really advice but impactful. 




 Stolen money/gift cards. 




 Find Steve jobs and tell him to make the iphone 10. 




 If you told him a dark secret or something that is heartbreaking to you or difficult, would he try and comfort you and give a damn?  




 No just do khakis and the polo. Or dress pants with a fun print and cardigan. 




 Probably when someone dies.  




 Clients, equipment, a plan of action.

What are you going to do for the dogs and in what time period? Costs? How are you going to promote? How will you "transfer" the dogs? Things like cutting nails have serious health implications and should be learned by a professional prior. 




 Me too. so much for my one moment of wit for the day :( 




 Probably Jim Kelly or a famous sport coach. 




 That there are so many weird hobbies and obsessions I never heard of, and that there are people with the same sense of humor as me out there.. Oh and people are actually willing to share information and help if you ask. 




 Not unless it's something I may return or a big ticket item. You never know, but food and stuff like that, NOPE.  




 Bleachers-I wanna get better 




 The wonder years whole album called "the upsides." 




 Any update? I can't keep track of new posts here. 




 Want to date? 




 I probably have like $1 floating around on that site. I think there's a sub for it... /r/mturk ? 




 A few things as a manager for a quick service place (and of course past worker):

Don't let this get you down. Yes, it's mcdonalds but everyone has their struggles and although you may not feel anyone else will hire you, they will. You have something to bring to the table, whether you know it or isn't visible yet.

You supervisor shouldn't make you feel angry or upset. It's his job to LEAD you. Leadership is about bringing out the best in people and helping them towards their goals and growing.

If you're not happy, I'd say quit. I know this isn't always possible because of financial situations but sometimes you just have to go with your gut.

Also, I kind of skimmed this post, but I hope you realize there will always be hardships in life and in a career and need to be able to cope and reorganize yourself to work through these issues. 




 75% off hotels. 




 I thought that too and considered eating it again. I don't think that's why I'm depressed though, although diet is probably one of my main problems. I bet this is more of a humorous post, but if anyone has articles on depression and meat/non meat eaters, send them my way. 




 A few other bands posted a video like this, I think they covered a Brand New song, maybe TBS. Anyone remember this or can link me? 




 Not sure what that means.. 




 I don't eat meat so I'm probably not the best person to ask. What dish is served with these options? Chicken is probably the healthiest, and if I ate meat, I'd only eat chicken or turkey. Lean meat, great protein, plus all the chickens in the world are only alive due to human breeding for dietary purposes, so if you're worried about what is humane, don't worry -- we already ruined the species and I don't think they can become extinct anymore. 




 My friends 2 year old sibling. So funny. 




 No but I'll eat anything at any time. 




 Likewise. 




 To put story behind the post, I want to get away from my problems, not talk about them. 




 Or experience any real happiness. 




 It's a coverup for my inability to connect/learn/make friends with depth... I guess 




 Namaste 




 No I do not know how to relax, that's my problem. Why relax when you could be doing something productive? HOWEVER, there is nothing that matters more in the world than happiness, making memories and connections, and learning from others. IMO at least. 




 She really is a great human. Need to read Amy's autobiography next. 




 Never been near a tornado, what are you guys doing? Where do you go? 




 No but Tina Fey's bossypants made me feel feelings. 




 Stuff from home, your own business. Maybe housekeeping, paperwork, secretary 




 Message me to talk, I'm on mobile and it's difficult but can help. 




 But I can't cut it out of my diet =( 




 Statue of Liberty too.
