 Well, if there's an unused android mobile going around, these apps will help. Though it must be noted that if the camera views an area outside a person's property - the law and regulations become, understandably, part of the equation. At the same time, a phone on a window sill may not be so noticed.

 I don't recommend it as a part of a confrontation, but without evidence of who did it - the council will do nothing.

I'd be very wary of it too hence the parenthesis. 




 "As Bible-believing Christians [must meet the other type], we will also turn our attention to the tragic compromise and downgrade of so many once-sound fundamentalist, Evangelical churches."

These are psychiatric symptoms not policy models. 




 I thought it read 'Democracy **of** Party Whip' at first, but then I remembered that's the last 20(?) years of Irish Politics and so this guy must be a spanner, or it says 'or'. 




 Have you caught them in the act e.g. kicking cap-stones?

It was a problem around where I live, and the council came down and talked to everyone involved, when there were definite council things damaged. Things calmed down a fair bit. Mind, it took a lot longer than it should have.

If you've video from your phone (as awkward as that is as a resolution step), at least you could show it around the other discomfited houses and see how it goes. 




 That'd be shocking really though, there's no work in the construction sector generally but there's loads to be done in this country. Money is becoming less of an object (at the government level, our bonds are doing well).

Wouldn't it be a perfect time for a stimulus that simultaneously brings jobs and infrastructure upgrades?

Ahhh, I wouldn't last a day in the Dil. It's opposite-land. 




 [Fair Enough](http://i.imgur.com/BXm4B5y.gif) 




 One thing I don't get - don't we need more schools, hospitals and infrastructure/repairs? 

Wouldn't that equally help the construction sector without artificially tampering with the housing market?

Though I'm sure first-time buyers need all the help that's going.

 Ah, Leave Angela out of it 




 Yeah, doesn't inspire confidence that the diary is filled out after the fact. I'm sure other ministers can confirm whether that's a regular occurrence.

Plus, we don't need this speculation at all. We can just ask 'Alan Shatter   Officials' when the meeting was held and check their diaries.

I'm sure the Taoiseach doesn't drive around on his own either, so wouldn't the driver service have a record of where he was that day and when they drove him there?

 




 Yeap same day as Sinn Fin are asking about.

I'd be inclined to go with the harmless interpretation that "I wasn't in Dublin until around 4", grand, the meeting in the Shelbourne was at 4.30; plus "Sunday morning meetings are rare, but I wasn't in Dublin at all." [at that time, but I was in Dublin later].

However, considering the early morning Shatter meeting was in the diary for the 23rd and is about the Garda business - it's all seeming a little suspect. Alan Shatter had no intention of resigning back in March. Plus the idea that the diary is filled out retrospectively is bad practice or just smoke-screen. 




 "Obviously, my apologies if that was sent out in error, it's not true. Sunday morning meetings are rare, but I wasn't in Dublin at all." [on the 23rd March]

 It's quite the story:

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/10/shell-pipeline-protests-county-mayo  




 It's a cash-grab when it's not being used for its stated purpose. 

PRSI is used to provide for you if you fall ill   can't work or lose your job (i.e. social insurance)

I'm for water charges in principle   practice, but as a conservation and infrastructure maintenance measure. Not this cludge from a government that still hasn't told us the cost per litre. Do they not know or are they not saying? Well, it's election time so I'm guessing it's both.

Putting in meters rather than fixing the leaks first, tells me this is more the prelude to privatisation than an environment resource measure. No commodity suits the needs of hedge funds better than water - people will always need it. And the push for privatisation has been going on for some time.

* [The World Bank and the International Development Bank highlighted **water privatization as a requirement for the Bolivian government in order to retain ongoing state loans**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_privatization_in_Bolivia)

* [The World Bank and water privatisation: public money down the drain](http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2008/09/art-562458/)

* [Even as the World Bank Group continues to promote water privatization, its own data reveal that a high percentage of its private water projects are in distress. Its project database for private participation in infrastructure documents a 34 percent failure rate for all private water and sewerage contracts entered into between 2000 and 2010](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/4/water-managementprivatizationworldbankgroupifc.html) 









 Smithers, Release the Cows! 




 It absolutely would. But what are the chances that the other 2 taxes we pay for water will remain in place?

This is a cash-grab, not a conservation measure.

Irish Water are spending our money on meters now, not fixing leaks which would be the ultimate conservation measure. 




 We are already pay for water via taxes (twice). The new water charge is not going to be spent on water infrastructure for some time. It's to pay off county council debts. That's the reality there.

There are many other deserving sources of revenue generation that could be tapped, rather than another charge on our tapped-out citizenry. 




 In this election, I'm voting **against** candidates as much as I'm voting **for** candidates. 









 I reckon it's more of a story than the non-story about [not queuing for one direction tickets](http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0514/617285-one-direction/), RT thought that was news-worthy on the same day.

Anyway, it's such a non-story there are four links about it above. Plus no-one's being charged for water yet, many things could change, though we'd have to be non-defeatist about it.

 




 Let's hope he doesn't realise any new ones

 I reckon a lot of people will see this as a bad thing (until they want something removed themselves), but as long as it's kept narrowly to its purpose I don't see it as much more than going ex-directory from the phone-book. Sure the phone's still active but it's not indexed.

Though I thought the 'right to be forgotten' was more about forcing companies to delete **all** the data they had about when you cancelled or otherwise severed ties with them. 









 If the medical card mess is anything to go by, the government is going to sit around and watch this trend continue.

Sometimes I think they look at the US and decide which unethical business practice to adopt from it next. 














 My view too.

Brand new AAA games are 70 ($95) in Ireland, not worth preordering at that price.

It'll have to be many good reviews   positive sentiment on the web before I'll consider spending that much money on a game, especially a Ubisoft game after buying AC3.

 If I remember correctly the downgrade in Gaeilege's status started under Fianna Fil's watch while Mr Byrne was a sitting member of FF in the Dil.

Ah, almost prescisely so:

"The derogation was originally in place for five years from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2011 but this was then extended for another five-year period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2016."
http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/(indexlookupdail)/20131128~PP?opendocument

Mr Byrne, a TD, from 2007 to 2011.

Hmmmm

 I guess it comes down to 'store credit' for what type of 'store'?

The cash is usually lower than the store equivalent, e.g. xtravision.

He is such a step backwards, I'd be appalled and a little nervous if he got a seat in Europe. 









 Go for a RaspberryPi with Raspbmc (xbmc) on it!

The whole package will be about the same price as a new AAA game, and is the best little media player around (blows the PS3 out of the water, bar the blu-ray). And it's fanless, so noiseless :) ~~^and^no^cinavia~~



 




 I'm enjoying it, wish there were more games but that's my fault for buying early.

What's really holding me back is 70 per game!

If new AAA games stay at that price - I'll wait for second-hand at 50 , or PS+ 









 I think the Ireland that believes what Labour says or promises is long gone.

 Don't let [Superintendent Foxtrot](https://imgur.com/Sc8af2c) have anything to do with your life (page 306).

And from [RT](http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0509/616164-guerin-report/):

The report concluded that Mr Shatter did not heed the voice of Sgt McCabe despite the high esteem in which he was held.

Mr Guerin said that was despite the minister having specific statutory powers in the area of complaints from members.

Mr Guerin said there was a "near total absence" in the papers he had examined of written records of submissions made, or advice given, to the minister by his officials.

He said he had seen no written internal records of decisions made by the minister.

Guerin said the approach adopted "had the result that there was no independent investigation" of Sgt McCabe's complaints.

He concluded that the absence of written records was a "matter of some concern", saying it appeared that the minister had acted "on foot of advice received by the commissioner", without that advice being questioned or analysed.

That is atrocious, Shatter looks like he completely sided with whatever Callinan wanted. 




 Wow, GSOC didn't give him a single document! 




 So she wasn't elected on the 3 occasions she was on the ballot, got a senate seat courtesy of the government and yet thinks she's a better prospect than a person who was duly elected.

Labour sure know how to pick 'em.

 I'd be happy to overtake the UK, Japan's education system though creates a fair few zombies (I taught an 11 year old over there with grey hair) so let's not aim too high. 




 Here's another one, though I've no idea about the paper mentioned - maybe someone here knows it:

http://ronancasey.ie/2014/05/woman-tears-up-election-leaflet-fined-e150/  




 You can use [ES file manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop) to connect to the Pi and thus it's harddrive and download them to the tablet that way.

Though if it's simply to watch movies on the tablet while within range of your home network you are much better off streaming the movies to your tablet. Use either the tablet's built-in video player, many come with network streaming now, or use something like [YAACC](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=yaacc fdid=de.yaacc) to provide the bridging-link between the Pi, your tablet and its video app. 









 I see he's going to give Defence to a [current minister](http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/fitzgerald-confirmed-as-new-justice-minister-629934.html), wonder who that'll be. 




 Which I can totally see, what I can't see is how the volume of water used by 13 million people is ultimately cheaper than the volume of water used by 4.5.

Together with the Tube, the awkwardness of city infrastructure in general - I imagine digging up for repairs is more costly in London also. 




 I know one person in that situation, it's an old row of houses in a small town - so I reckon it could be very common.

And then there's my brother's house where nobody knows where to put his meter. He even called the original builder (in his 70s now) and he'd no clue where it met up with the town supply either.

Three different people called my brother about it from the contracting company without knowing about the other calls, so you can imagine phonecall #3 was shorter and louder than 2 previous. 




 The situation I mean is where the branching points from the main pipe to all the other houses (after house A) are under house A or otherwise inaccessible. 

Making house A the only one that can be metered, or the piping has to be redone from scratch for all the houses. 




 According to the Irish Times we'll be [paying 0.2 cents per litre](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/bath-set-to-cost-16-cent-while-a-shower-will-set-you-back-25-cent-1.1787308).

So 0.2 cents per litre = 200 cents per 1000 litres or

2 per 1000 litres.

So we'll be more expensive than London, a city with a greater population than our whole country.

Wouldn't it be great if Phil Hogan or Irish Water actually told us the charge? 









 One thing I haven't seen resolved are the cases where a row of houses share the one pipe - making it impossible to individually meter each house's usage.

What happens if the house that can be metered (or simply one of the houses) refuses to pay the bill - do all the houses have their pressure reduced to a trickle? 









 I can really see a motive for Microsoft in this,  they are facing a future where windows becomes a legacy OS. With only a few copies of windows required inside a VM even within an enterprise context.

Then I looked at the permissions for the new android version of Firefox today, I reckon Firefox is more deserving of an arched eyebrow in this case and in a more general sense - than the purists posting user controlled solutions on forums

 Much apologies, I may have my wires crossed on this one!

Looking at both, I'm having a hard time deciding which species I [have](https://imgur.com/U0ca2sU).

Either way, I only know one other person who's training them as bonsai. Cheers for the other plant name!
 









 Ah, not where I'm from (Ireland), every mention of a Money Tree is a crassula. 




 Seconding the money tree [(Jade Tree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_plant), will tolerate a fair amount of neglect and can look very bonsai after a year or two.

I recommend they should be grown in a regular sized house-plant pot for a year (or two) until the roots have developed. Then placed into a shallower bonsai pot.

Ficus drove me bananas, I swear they have a passive aggressive nitrogen deficiency thing going on. 




 I reckon that's a completely accurate way of looking at this blast from the past.

Here's another, Eamonn Gilmore will say anything while not in power to get votes - he's just a politician after all and not exceptional in this regard or example.

Yet this can tell us 2 things:

* Eamonn hitched his ride to the Workers Party on principles of a fair society / water provision that he no longer adheres to.

* He has yet again (his Lisbon treaty flip-flop) kowtowed to an EU directive over and above the directive's intent (reasonable decision making reforms / water conservation) and decided it's more about cash for institutional fuck-ups. Or at least, let his 'betters' instruct him so.

In any election there are 'turkeys voting for christmas' - e.g. the ~17% who voted FF in the last election - but Eamonn's turkeys and christmas are movable feasts. He doesn't have to worry though, his policy choices do not have to read as any egregious compromise for the country. He'll simply blame the majority partner with a 'what would it have been like without us' reasoning. He may be expecting the limited communication abilities of 80s here, as his stance won't wash in our internet era. 

I've heard plenty of secondary school students get riled up about this blithe indifference to the net, netizens and it's technorati. As if the net's only an exaggeration-engine and not also the 'printing-press' with a power Irish newspapers envy.

His eyes are on his life after politics. I think his leadership will retire what 'Labour' is left of the Labour party, and his party seems fairly fine about it.

That Ireland's electorate vote via reflex, in pluralities, is a daily awful reminder that the Dil is us. We have done this to ourselves to a very large part.

That is no excuse for the failure of its cheerleaders, such as Gilmore though. 




 I don't reckon he's a puppet-master either.

A combination of minence grise and experienced solicitor should be enough to cow a taoiseach who is unable to debate his own policies in public.

I'd certainly claim Enda is a puppet.

I'd put Shatter at set-designer   back-stage bouncer though, not p/muppet-master

 Ah, Elaine Byrne isn't likely to be anyone's stooge:

["The chair of the Revenue Commissioners, Josephine Feehily, noted that although 289 cases of illegality were identified in relation to the largest tax evasion scheme in Irish history, not one person has been prosecuted over the Ansbacher tax scandal."](http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/elaine-byrne-major-reform-is-essential-to-tackling-whitecollar-crime-29383431.html)

Corruption is long established here, we'll need a generational die-off and more like her - with unfettered outlets for their research - if we're to bring it down to 'normal' corruption. 




 Jaysus, Billy Hawkes finally grew a pair!?

It'll probably be like the time he found one of Facebook's privacy invasive practices "completely unacceptable" and then let them carry on with it for 6 months (enough time to rehouse the activity outside the EU).

This will be overturned on appeal, then Alan can brush the shit off his shirt to let it drop on Billy. It's not like 2 people have lost their jobs after tangling with him, or anything.

Alan S must have some shit on E E that they expressed confidence in a Minister for Justice that broke the law on national TV. Has a minister (for Justice) ever done that before?

 In fairness, all of those points are **their job** - for which they are paid more than adequately.

Have we reached a point where we expect so little from the Dil that TDs turning up and doing what they're elected to do is laudable?

Here are some other achievements:

* Held a referendum on a stability fund that we can't access a year and a half before we would have needed it anyway. Losing a negotiating position in the process.
* Asserted the need for a pay-cap in public positions, which is then flouted by the Taniste.
* Let the Minister for Justice mislead the Dil after he revealed a TD's penalty point situation live on national TV. None of which jeopardises his job.
* Failed to address the shortcomings of the Data Protection Commissioner which has now lead to the drafting of new EU laws, one of which is specifically designed to avoid the need for EU citizens to go through that Irish office to make complaints.
* Allowing a debt defaulter to be in charge of the country's biggest budget which, surprise surprise, he can't balance.
* Failed to address the egregious loopholes exploited by foreign multinationals which sees a certain company pay 0.14% in tax, instead of 12.5%. Meanwhile Irish companies the absolutely vast employers of people in Ireland see new levies, taxes   rates while remaining on 12.5%. Corporate welfare at its finest.
* Introduced a Property tax   soon a Water charge which makes a mockery of maintaining basic social welfare rates and rates of income tax.
* Increased school classroom numbers which are now the highest in Europe.
* Fails to acknowledge that much of recovery in this country would not have been possible without the ~400,000 people who have left Ireland over the past 5 years for work.
