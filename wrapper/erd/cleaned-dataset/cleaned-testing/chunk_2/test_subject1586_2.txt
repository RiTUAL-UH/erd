 Yeah,  because I was confused,  too. Thank you for the explanation! 




 We might need to highlight this post as it gives twitter handles for people to send suggestions to with ideas on improving the Browns fan experience. This is a powerful thing that I don't think many teams have. *EDIT: spelling* 




 I think your text length was just fine. I have no problem with off field antics that dont hurt anybody. People live life and they make mistakes and people deal with pain and recreation differently. I think in the grand scheme of things we have a guy who likes to party hard when he's not succeeding at football spectacularly, and a relatively low key guy who smokes weed and blows it up on the gridiron.  I dont think either of them are being detrimental to the team, currently. I do have a bias: I live in Washington and am witnessing how benign the transition has been of legalized marijuana. One day I think this will be a highly antiquated conversation. I think it will be within the next decade that we will see major changes, and probably sooner than that. Now IM sorry for the text wall! 




 I personally think that the NFL marijuana policy is the part that is out of line, in my personal opinion. Even Goodell knows, I believe. Neither of them is doing anything that I see as detrimental to their game, or others, yet. 









 Thank you for your diligence  




 I appreciate your diligence in learning the unfortunate truth that I myself learned: He doesnt exist.

 Not quite. something like this, but the Brownie http://www.fanatics.com/league/nfl/team/cleveland_browns/cleveland_browns_die-cut_metal_logo_auto_emblem/partnerid/8429/source/GPA_CA-1338653-505?CAWELAID=  CAGPSN=pla 




 Does anyone know where this artifact may be located?  I can only find the metal helmet decal. I know someone had to have made the Brownie into a smarty looking metal car decal. I've looked everywhere,  and the last thing I can think to do is ask y'all..

 Thanks Heegs. That makes my day!

 Thank you,  and sorry!  




 I did NOT know that. That is why I love this reddit. 




 I feel about the Steelers the way Vegita feels about Goku (Dragon Ball Z reference). He can hate him, but you dont know shit about him, so stay back. If anyone is going to dis the Steelers, its us. We have to play them 2 times every year, forever. There is a hidden honor there. We hate them the way brothers who have had a falling out hate. If anyone else trash talks them, I get offended and think "They dont have any right to trash talk the Steelers. I have a right to trash those bastards, but your Charger lovin' ass can stuff it." With that said, we have to honor our opponents that deserve honoring,  and celebrate their lives once they pass. They put up with our bickering, and they understood us better than anyone else in the league. And for that I honor a man who took his team to 4 Super Bowls. Be at peace,  Chuck. Steelers Heaven is undoubtedly welcoming you in grand style. 














 Remove the teachers and make them Mentors. Demand excellence in Math, Science, Social Studies, Sports and the Arts, but dont force a curriculum. Give the children choices and allow them to create the education they want. Make it a forum where the kids choose the direction they want thwir studies to go. Have American History, but allow the child to decide what parts they want to learn. If they dont care about the Dust Bowl, but spend 4 years learning about Ohio Railroads, the only thing that does is make them a walking resource on a subject that they are passionate about, instead of wasting 4 years teaching them a little bit about everything they dont care to remember. Don't make them read "The Wind in the Willows", make them have to read something that interests them. Be there as a guide to help them find knowledge for themselves, and ditch standardized testing. Train the Mentors in how to give a written assessment,  and then give the kids a real grade that isnt attached to a letter, but to a document that details their attitude and accomplishments and if they have learned the fundamentals to move to the next level of resources, then syart suggesting things that seem to flow with what they already seem to be doing. Every reading assignment is from a famous American author? Suggest some Tom Wolfe. The student seems to gravitate toward modern sci-fi? Suggeat some classic Asimov to round out their education. That is the difference between a Mentor and a Teacher. A Mentor helps you discover the world in which you can flourish and find things that bolster your knowledge. A Teacher stands in front of you and helps you learn a set of knowledge that is pre planned by someone who makes curriculums for a living. Also, as a parent of 3 "No Child Left Behind" age children, I would ditch it so fast. 2 of them dont read well, and the third only does because he plays video games. That program is "Leave All the Children Behind and Forget About Their Whole Generation" but that might be a little political there at the end. 




 Honey says she loves her bandana in this one! 




 She says it looks great! 




 Done. Sorry for the confusion  









 I posted in the title that it was my dog, but if there is something more I need to do, I would be happy to. I have about 25 pictures of her. Just let me know what more I need to do. 









 Thank you so much! I like the tartan around her shoulders. She is clan MacTeig. It would be wild if that was similar to her family colors. Thank you!

 I see in the news that the balance is further exerting itself, today. All 3 running backs, now? I hate it for, y'all. 




 I was homeless for a good part of my tween and teen years. I am also from Ohio. Well, it's cold in Ohio, and being homeless doesn't confine itself to when it's warm. This makes for a lot of cold winter nights; lonely and alone. I used to talk to the Moon and Orion every night in the winter, that they were out. The problem is Orion is only out in the cold months,  and I was homeless and in need of someone to talk to all the time, so when I turned 18 I got him tattooed in dots and lines on my forearm. This way I had him with me always.  I got the idea when I saw a friend at a festival with him tattooed on his ankle. My friend is a Sagittarius,  and so his Orion is the Archer version.  Mine is the Lion and Club version.  




 Wow...the Gyro...womp. Good call. 




 As a person who loves the Browns, and as a native of Kent, Ohio (Kent State Flashes) my favorite is my flair: #16 Mr. Joshua Cribbs. A walk on, home town, Special Teams, sensation that many believe caused the new blocking rules on kick returns; forever letting it be known in Cleveland as "The Cribbs Rule" because of how it dramatically decreased his effectiveness. But this does not change how I feel about him. He would have been a shoe in for Canton if he had won a ring, and may still, but either way, Cribbs is my boy. 




 I somewhat linked to it through this post where I poke a little fun at the ratbirds and they start cawing up a storm.  *spelling*

 Either way I wish you all the luck.

 I am a traveling minister for an earth based religion, so I plan on putting a lot of cool pics up. Im really appreciative of your  amazing work. Thanks again and I hope this isnt a single serving friend moment. Safe travels and ttys. 




 Posting it to /r/Browns because its the gospel, not the votes.  









 The Ravens were created after Baltimore made a deal with the Devil. So many angry  prayers smoldered through the earth into the bowels of the Devils play place. Day and night he was assaulted with the lamentations of the lost souls, pining for their Colts. Finally the Son of Light heard a call that would end his suffering: Art Modell was weak, and was begging for release. So Lucifer, that wily old devil, whispered into the ears of each of the most powerful people in Baltimore and within the Browns, and a deal was struck! That deal included 2 SB, and safety from any lasting harm that may come against any of his players and original staff that took part in the move. In return the Browns would move to Baltimore, and in a seperate trade for his immortal soul Belichick obtained his own deal, but that will be a story for another day. And so it was that a faithful and historic football city the likes of Cleveland was stripped of their team, and Baltimores prayers were answered. But oldschool fans know in their hearts which side answered their prayers that day.  It is within each true original Baltimore Colts fan. That seed. That knowledge that it was not a godsend. It came from the other direction. And they know when he came to collect. The Super Bowl in the Super Dome. That light failure was no fluke. That was the Prince of Darkness showing up to watch the final moments of his deal. You won. And so did he. And now that Devils deal Baltimore made has come around to the other side, as all deals eventually do. I have a feeling that you will be seeing much more of this as the balance exherts itself. Safe travels, friends.  




  I have seen how amazing a lot of these pictures on this sub turn out, but I never expected this to be so amazing. Thanks again! 




 This is SICK! I love the medium you used. The use of light and dark are amazing and it looks VERY  Faerie. Thank you! *edit for spelling*

 Uhhhhh, story? 




 Grossi also called the Harbaugh Bowl 




 SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY! 




 I like Grossi 




 In 1983 my grandparents were friends with the equipment manager of the Browns. He left with the Ravens and is still their equipment manager. He had me decked out in Browns gear from the crib onward. Let the fair weather fans come out. More orange and brown for er'body! 




 I was going off of the news report that I read earlier about them telling him that CLE is a working town. It reminded me that few people get anything handed to them in NE Ohio. We make people who become presidents and astronauts because we know that hard work and dedication breed success. We want Johnny to be a success.

*edit: its not about "Making him pay for it". That was really thrown around by the media.  Its about learning. I understand lineage. Manzeil isn't just sitting on the sidelines, he's learning from Hoyer, who learned from Brady, who learned from Belichick. This is putting Johnny into that lineage and is part of what has the chance to take him from "Possible Great" to "Amazing"* 




 The media wants Manzeil to pay the Gold Price for his spot on the roster and to shine like the football savior of Cleveland. The Browns want him to pay the Iron Price and to work hard to become great, like a lump of fine metal forged into a powerfully sharp razors edge. 




 He can't get fucked because he's eating dirt while we are here to talk about him. His basic perpetual removal from Canton runnings is his well earned legacy. *EDIT Spelling* 




 Those things are the s*it 




 Are Browns questions inappropriate for this sub? 




 Well you're pretty much the laughing stock of our sub! Bart is that you? Come off of twitter to get rough n tumble in our sub?  




 I liked Cooper. Oby ftw for sure. Go Browns.

 Though April 2013 Sirius XM had 20mil+ subscribers.

 You have to make an account, so if thats not your bag (it isnt mine) a good read and click for their page views is still a good way to support their positive efforts. 




 I just found this sane and informative article by a news source so far removed from Ohio that they can only be considered "National". Lets leave some positive comments on this one. You can only read 5 of their articles in 30 days. Go Browns! 

http://www.santafenewmexican.com/sports/browns-qb-johnny-manziel-i-m-just-a-rookie/article_ccb10fa0-68b2-5714-a51c-ba4676a4d062.html 




 And Pat Kerwin is TRUE national media. He's on Sirius XM, and millions of people pay to hear his opinion. Ive never even heard of the author of this article. 




 Bart is currently posting pictures of Jets minicamp. This was my response after reading his bashing tweets on CLE. Oh, and Go Browns. 

*@HubbuchNYP  I've been so busy with local Cleveland Media that I haven't had time for this national stuff. Jets, huh? How're they doin'?* 




 I asked Haden on Twitter. (I messed up the beginning,  but *shrug*)

@joehaden23 @hadenwill you come on reddit to r/browns to do an AMA? (ask me anything)? I understand if Farmer has to sign off. Invite him :) 




 Is it just me? Mike Freeman seems to have a grudge, or a secret crush on the Browns which makes him mean. He's like a black and yellow ratbird that just flys over top of C
Ohio and sustains itself off of the bounty that is Cleveland, while just crapping all over everything.

 I see where you're coming from,  and I personally think they are mosquitos,  but just because someone is into art and design doesn't automatically mean they are doctoring photos. Maybe a life long love of photography was the thing that inspired this person to go into arts and design.  Chances would be they had taken a lot of pictures in their life,  probably more than the average person. Just a question of odds says they have a better chance of capturing an anomaly due to the sheer volume of pictures taken. Though I don't think it's faeries,  I don't think his profession should automatically rule him out as a faker.

 Has anyone been keeping up on his crusade on Wikipedia? He has made some pretty high level computer hacker type enemies through it. I dont know if there is a correlation. I just know that he has been attacking right wing anti-pagan Wikipedia editors who have been systematically getting pagan pages taken down, through the abuse of the rules system. It even caused one of them to get their real life persona outed, and themselves banned from Wikipedia. Planting pictures on someones computer doesnt take Anonymous level hacking skills. Did someone actually do that *shrug* I'm a bit of a conspiracy nut, so maybe/maybe not. This is just something that went through my head.  *edited for spelling*

 ###"Never Date a Writer" inspired by the works of "xstephens"

Never date a writer,    
no just never date a writer.    
It's been spoken at least once before,    
I know this;    
I'm inspired.    
If it's their ire you inquire,    
then you might just catch on fire    
In some sultry sleazy novel    
that goes screaming down the wire    
They'll start writing    
and just writing    
Diatribes that are so biting    
Of your hip size    
and your thigh size    
of that surprise between your thigh size    
Oh he's right!    
that writer writes    
about his libel barks and bites    
and as I sit here quite a quiver    
at this feeling he's delivered    
of his maddened observation    
that has taken hold his liver    
and contrived his consternation    
That has brought me such Elation!    
For it's true    
I say it's true    
as a peddler of my whimsy    
that at times a writer can be trite    
Our ego's may be flimsy    
So our hero's in our story    
tend to hint at lusted glory's    
we may wish we had the livers    
to stand proudly and deliver    
And our villains may resemble    
those that made us shake and tremble    
And so I ramble on the merits
of this Shakespearean Degenerate (that's 'day-djo-nare-it' for the non bourgeoisie)    
and you have grinned and bared it    
So there's one more thing I share:    
The street it goes two ways    
as the pen it streaks the paper    
Not always are the ones close by    
the Mobster or the Raper    
you're the ones who create the sonnets    
the inspirers of Romances    
You bring about our ecstasy    
as our paper and quill dances    
so thank you for your sacrifice    
Our art exists by you.    
You light our fuse    
You are our muse    
We love you.    
I swear we do...     




 A wonderful poem about the Mother. 









 Ive been reading your post history to find out if you are as aggressive and attacking to others as you have been to me. Turns out youre worse. You say some of the nastiest, meanest, and unhelpful things and you do it all over reddit and you do it thinking you are correct for trashing the folks you do. You trash people who think differently than you, and your posts are often just mean and belittling. "GTFO"? Why would you cuss that at someone or attack people, period? I thought that was against reddicate and against most subreddit rules. I think a long walk and maybe some medical marijuana might help you. Good luck. I know you'll most likely lash out at me, as is you M.O. or tell me that medical marijuana has no positive studies and that I'm an idiot. Thats okay. Ive gotten used to you and I now see that you cant help but be combative, and reddit is probably how you discharge all that negativity so that it doesn't effect your walking life (if you have one, because the level of negative interactions you have daily on reddit suggest you may ONLY  have this outlet to relieve yourself of the poison that your personality creates within you.) Bless your heart, it must be hard to have to force feed your opinions with a sledgehammer to those that dont think the way you do. Good luck, again, and may reddit protect its charges from the worst of your aggression. 




 A wonderful poem about the Mother. 









 I dont know if you are American or not, but I learned on a recent trip (my firs) to Canada how subliminal words can be. In Canada they have the same red circle and white line through the middle "Do Not Enter" street signs, but they do not say "Do Not Enter" on them. They just assume you know what it means, and they don't add that added line of, what I learned after not being subjected to it for 2 weeks is, aggression. I found this article to be saying the same thing: "Our wording is detrimental" I haven't said anything, and I don't believe the article said anything about any medical treatment being wrong, or inappropriate. the main point I saw was the need for a change in our verbiage, and I agree. 




 I'm not saying it isnt "profitable", it's just not "cornerable"; Which I should have been more clear on. And here are a couple links about case studies on Manuka honey and would healing.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16722850
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1742-481X.2012.01082.x/full (Though to be fair you have to subscribe to read this one)
And this more illustrated and nsfw link: http://www.medline.com/media/mkt/pdf/Therahony-study.pdf 




 I think much of the problem is you cant patent manuka honey. It just kills staph infections, and theres no way to capitalize on it monetarily. Same with reiki, chiropractics and homeopathy; iteslf around since the 1800's with 100's of positive case studies. You just cant patent and control the medicine.
