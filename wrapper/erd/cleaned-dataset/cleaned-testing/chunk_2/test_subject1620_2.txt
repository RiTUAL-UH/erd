 Sure, here's some info:

I've always been on the thin side, when I first stared what resembled a workout routine I was a mere 5'11, 145lbs. Within the last year I have been in between 160-170lbs.

I was underweight for my age as well. Maintaining a good diet i.e. eating enough calories to maintain your level exercise and staying hydrated are critical for proper exercise. Without food   water exercise would, for me at least, just make my migraines worse.

My goals for exercise had nothing to do with migraines actually, I just wanted to put on some muscle before heading off to college. It took finding a good balance of cardio and weight lifting before (3 days of each I mentioned) while eating enough and drinking enough water before my migraines dwindled off. I imagine that if I had migraine elimination as a goal of exercise and the information I have now, they would've gone away sooner.

I will also mention that when I say "proper diet", I just mean eating enough to keep up with the calories you're burning in the gym and still gain muscle. I don't count calories or nutrients or anything like that, although I'm sure healthy eating would only help more.   




 I remember constantly being pushed more and more medication at the neurologist and doctor's visits when I was younger.... funny how the simplest things seem to work the best
