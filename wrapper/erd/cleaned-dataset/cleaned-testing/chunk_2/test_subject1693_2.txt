 Rude! 




 What if LoL had characters from anime like Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi, etc. Kakashi's ult would be his sharingan and he could send the opponent champion anywhere on the map. Or from Fairy Tail Natsu's fire dragon roar would be his Q. Would take a million years in programming but worth it. 




 Yes, he wasn't a total monster but also I don't think he did anything deserving of what he got in the end. Even the really bad  things he did were justified and I think if many of us were in his place at the time, we would have done the same thing (assuming we're as clever as Walter White). 




 Really? How? You're right I do think they're the same thing. 




 Yeah, true. But it's still agreed upon that he killed her, don't you think so? 




 Anything can ruin lives, not just drugs. It's up to the consumer to say no, it's not up to the man trying to make a living. For all you know, meth could have enhanced the lives of a minority who would otherwise have nothing else. 




 One second. You don't think "justified" and "not wrong" are the same thing? Because I do. 




 I can't believe you writed that.
