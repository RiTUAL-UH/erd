 I had this... 




 This!  




 Timmay!  




  I'm thinking that the Nexus 5 is available for purchase on the Play Store on Halloween, which would tie in the whole KitKat thing.

This! New Nexus 10 would be nice as well.  




 May the pings be with you...  




 That too! 




 I wonder how the 840 compares to the evo series.  




 LOL, hardly. That was in the winter. I think Maine Coons fluff up more during the cold seasons.  




 My Maine Coon is the same. Very smart and vocal. At least more then any other breed of cats I've had. 

Here is Jasper.

 Ugh! Sorry. I can't seem to add NSFW to it now.  




 Comcast stream pix service with standard none HD TV with HBO and HBO Go has been offered. To me in the past for only $4.99 a month for the first year and then $9.99 with no contract as long as you have the blast or 20mbps or higher speed.  




 I picked it up for $5 so I can do a replay. Looking forward to it.  




 I would like to know the MODs as well.  




 I read the book first, and it was great to play the game later. I'm probably partial to the series.  




 Metro 2033 8/10
Metro: Last Night 8/10
 




 Oh yes! Time for a replay.  




 It's for http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/35790000
 




 :) 




 Must relocate to Barrow, Alaska. Duration: 3-6 month contract ( might go long term ). 




 The gameplay sounds like Deus Ex : Human Revolution (http://www.deusex.com/) but in the Alien universe to me.  




 I did not make, just posting. The artist is @ http://thefreshdoodle.deviantart.com/ 




 Sorry, I just copy and paste the description. 




 According to the comments, yes, he made it for his daughter. 

 Was a fun piece. Made this one for my other daughter. :)

  crane fly

Thanks!

From Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_fly

 Contrary to myth, crane flies do not bite humans, nor do they consume mosquitoes. The larvae of some species are carnivorous on other small invertebrates, sometimes including mosquito larvae. **Many adults, however, have such short life spans that they do not eat at all.**

Stuff in bold makes me sad. 




 It's from Castlevania: Lords of Shadow Ultimate edition http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/234080/ 




 Icons are available for free download @ http://iconfactory.com/freeware/preview/semi 




 That is great! 

Remindms me to mount one of those up on top of my doorway just like that in time for Halloween.  




 $10 seems cheap for 2 years. I'd renew.  




 Just like when the PC version came out. Give it a month or so and then you should be able to play it.  




 And that carpet...

 To this day, no mobile telephone standards committee has considered

because the big companies involved, huge telcos, are all in bed with

the default on mobile phones.
