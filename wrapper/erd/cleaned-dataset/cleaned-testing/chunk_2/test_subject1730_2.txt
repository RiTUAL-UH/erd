 And the guys (and gals) who work the tenders love ATON. Everyone I've ever met who worked a tender had been trying to get back to one. 




 I love how people forget that they USCG is the 5^th branch of the US Armed Services. If I recall correctly too, the High Endurance Cutters (Hamilton Class) were picked up by the USCG after being rejected by the US Navy as a ship design. Additionally, putting a CIWS right over the screw is a horrible fucking design. 




 If I had to guess, I would say that it looks like a nun buoy. 




 As a former Coastie, it warms my heart to see this! Thanks and keep up the great work!

I also managed to find all three of your easter eggs! 




 I highly doubt that. Even though they are law enforcement, every year their budget keeps getting cut and they can barely maintain their aging fleet. 




 Hopefully the tapes will be better this time around. 




 I'm now lurking in diaperfurs :P 




 Awesome! Thanks for the response! 




 Fantastic! I shall be joining both shortly! 




 Thank you! I shall check it out! 




 That's quite nice! And it looks really good on you! 




 That's sort of the problem with #biglittlepodcast on Rizon. It's great when the podcast is going on but for the most part, it's dead. I miss the old Yahoo chat groups :( 




 So freaking cute and adorable! Where did you get it? 




 Hello everyone. Does anyone know of any AB/DL specific IRC channels other than the one for the biglittlepodcast? 




 Amazing photos and costumes! Fun fact! In the book, the apprentice's name is [Michael Fisher](http://howlscastle.wikia.com/wiki/Michael_Fisher) and he's actually 15 years old. 




 Good for you! Even though Depends are generally disliked, they are a relatively cheap intro for adult diapers! Enjoy them! 




 I guess the question to ask yourself is "What are you looking to get out of all of this?" Her interests are rather small but her groups show that she's a member of a couple of AB/DL groups. So she's got some interests in the fetish even if nothing's listed in her profile. Another thing to bear in mind is that not everyone has a webcam. I know almost every laptop now has one built in, but if she has a desktop, there's no guarantee of a webcam. You could always ask if she's got an amazon wishlist and ask her to put a webcam on there that you could purchase for her too.  




 Hmmm... You might be able to find something that's fragrant free or you can try a corn starch based powder. However, you can help cut down on the smell by applying a bit less and rubbing it in. I've found that even though we can be paranoid because WE know we're diapered, most everyone else either doesn't know or if they smell it, won't care. I went to school with a gentleman who would dust his crotch with baby powder every day to help cut down on chafing. 




 TO sorta quote Spacey: "Tell them if it will further enhance your relationship." If you think it will make things between you even better, then tell her!  




 One thing I would recommend is to give your body like 30 minutes or so to air out each day. Letting your diaper area breathe a bit each day will help cut down on rashes. Also, lots of powder and/or oil or lotion. Which ever you prefer. Other wise enjoy it! What's your go-to diaper for daily wear and wearing at night?     




 At first, it seemed to be a bit cobbled together, but it's become much smoother. I feel that happens to any podcast though as they figure out what's going on and how they want things to run/flow. As for content, I love hearing the behind the stories of some of reddit's biggest celebrities. I also feel that things like banana for scale and such are so fleeting that it's like trying to hype up pogs. There one minute and gone the next. Personally though, I like hearing about the minutia and little bits of trivia that not everyone might not know about stories and people. 




 I've enjoyed this podcast! I'm starting to get into listening to podcasts and this is one of my favourites! Keep up the good work and I can't wait to listen to next weeks!  




 I love the composition of old and new. 




 Out of everything there... I want your shoes :P 




 I wish you both the best in this! 




 Great choices! Personally, I'm not a fan of Molis anymore but that's because it seems all of the padding always clumps down to the middle. 




 And time to save this page to the Diaper Supply folder! 




 So freaking cute!!!  




 I haven't tried it, but would love to. Even if there's no milk. I think it would put me in little headspace pretty quickly. 




 I wore cloth as a kid. My brother was the one to wear disposables... I might be able to make a small cloth diaper for her. 




 True, but it would look better than a 24/7 on her :P

I'm not in a rush though. But I love the idea of making my own!
