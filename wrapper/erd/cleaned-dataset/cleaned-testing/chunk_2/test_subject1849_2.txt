 Respond to the side decks with anti side deck cards 




 But Ya. We voted against the gas tax indexing. Voters will hate gas tax increases and higher taxes to pay for the billion+ dollars in necessary equipment and construction costs. 









 Yes. GX is better than 5Ds based on theme song, actors' voices, and plot line, but it is a bit rushed.  




 I am not a fan of pendulum decks, but if there was one to be hyped about.... It would be DDD and D/D.  




 Yes. Then, resell.  




 It will go down because supply will increase in the future.  




 People are not going to sell their LC to flood the market again. There is an incentive to do so, but considering how valuable this card is....and there is only one way to get it.... It is really hard for people to get it in the first place. Also, the price is increasing because demand for it is increasing. Volcanic Deck hype. Supply isn't really increasing and there is a finite amount at the moment.  




 Oh Geez.... An Oligophy on Lavalval Chain maybe.... 




 How did North Carolina elect this Senator? really? 




 Well, it is better to buy singles, since the full boxes have a lot of random cards that people don't really need. Buying full boxes is good when the product is first released, so people can sell the singles earlier for market power.  




 Yes, but it should be a minimum of 3 batters.   3 outs do make an inning for a team. 




 Because it is not very effective. 




 I could see DDD decks becoming stronger with more support.  




 How do you know if sets are out of circulation? 




 Right....The Revs will continue to lose XD 




 If you located in an area without many people to trade or sell, you will sell damaged cards because it is the only source of cards. 




  Yes, probably the biggest mistake of his career. In both of these cases, actually, his motivations weren't political or personal, but philosophical. He was great at being "Mr. Conservative," but that sometimes came at the expense of good political sense.
 

I fully agree. I don't think the Republican Party is racist at all, but there is a definitely a faction of Southern racists, who will side with the Republican Party in general than Democratic Party on a wide range of issues.  




 Maybe, but he did say that he wanted cheap shadolls.... 




 Don't forget that he opposed the Civil Rights Act for constitutional reasons. 




 Check around if there are cards in poor condition. :) 




 So basically, Rescueroid can't return itself.  




 The new errata is this. 

"When a "roid" monster you control is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, you can return that monster to its owner's hand."

It used to be:

"While this card is face-up on your side of the field, when a "roid" monster on your side of the field is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, you can return that monster to the hand."

 Does anybody have a list of archtypes that occured during 5Ds and Zexal? 




 gogoanime.com 




 They are probably not making money of yugioh at their place, so they drastically cut prices to see what happens. 




 Batteryman is good wih 9v and Monarch's Stormforth 




 Maybe, but coalitions are also good. More parties is better than just 2 main parties. Elections become more interesting and competitive.  




 Proportional representation. Encourages political diversity. majority rules actually governs.  




 Well, the team "win" or "loss" is the same thing. In other sports, they don't give out "W" and "L" to the clutch player. 




 One way to stop corruption is to replace our "Republic", which inherently favors a 2 party system and individuals representing people instead of ideology representing people, and move torwards a democracy with more political parties. 




 Of course, intercity travel is already an oligophy for high speed travel.  




 Please Relocate the Tampa Bay Rays... Montreal vs Toronto and Montreal vs Boston would be amazing.  




 Keep the Shift. Strategy makes the game interesting because the defense is not stagnant in the same positions. 

If MLB wanted more runs and offense, Put the DH in the National League. An average MLB pitcher is almost 85%+ a guaranteed out. They are worse than the worst actual batter in any lineup.

If you want drastic changes to rules to boost offense, How about don't count all fouls as strikes? Why 2 strikes and a foul = nothing happens, yet first 2 fouls = strikes? Why not have all fouls = strikes to speed up the game? 




 So... "Once per Turn" effects would workon opponent's turn if it "Once per turn, during either player's turn;" o.....

For Spells and Traps, "Once per a Turn" can be applied in both? 




 Change the tax rates, demolish buildings that you don't like, or make historical for some buildings 




 What is the whole rulings on "once per a turn" effects?

 




 Not really. Perot's voters were anti-establishment, anti-free-trade, moderate on some issues, anti-2 party system, and swing left and right on random issues. His supporters were from Clinton's Populist Labor Faction that includes Labor Unions, who were against New Democrats (Blue Dogs) and Bush's moderate Anti-Reaganonomics + RINOs + some Far-Right Conservatives (Who liked some Perot's Nationalistic Policies).  




 If he runs as an Independent, I will vote most likely support the Democrat because the consequences of a Republican President from a split leftwing vote is bad for the Supreme Court, Gerrymandering, Foreign Policy, Agenda setting, and Exectutive Orders. I hate the 2 party system, but it is how it is supposed to work.  




 Absolutely, I agree. Draft Picks for the worst teams rewards failure. Also, NFL is also a communist/socialist centralized sports league that shares profits/revenues evenly for each sports team. Also, the Union Ownerhsip of the Green Bay Packers is bad for business.  




 You will see more offense, which means that good defenders now will rise in value because there are so few of them in MLS.  




 I don't understand why Toronto is picking Altidore over Gilberto.  




 The players threathen strike, but they know that a strike will tremendously affect the whole league in a negative way.

The league does need to reform its parity, rules, free agency, and money. If the league takes a loss this year, projected growth says that the league will continue to grow, so taking debt now, won't necessarily impact the league finances in the long-term. 
 




 I stopped watching yugioh during zexal. i watched original yugioh and yugioh 5ds somewhat sporadically. I watched gx very closely. I say arc-v is one of the best series that Konami has made.  




 I hope speed roids are released in this or Crossover Souls 




 The two party system causes it as well. 




 I don't want to be bias, so no Revs.  




 Yes, Giles Barnes. The question says who is good for next season. Next season, Houston has Cubo Torres. 




 No. City SC or City FC is boring. 

Orlando City SC should just be Orlando City Lions SC.  




 Forwards: Dom Dwyer, Robbie Keane, Gilberto

Right Wing: Finlay, Nagbe, Neagle

Left Wing: Davis, Zusi, Pappa, 

Attacing Midfield: Barnes, Feilhaber, Valeri

Defending Midfield: Alonso, Juninho, Kitchen

Defenders: Hedges, Gonzalez, Horst

Defensive Wingers: Franklin, Beasley, Beitashour

Goalkeeper: Hamid, MacMath, Ousted
 




 I think Montreal's defense will be good this season.  




 Atlanta Firebirds is the best name.  




 LOL. If you want a Communist Sports League, Look at the NFL. 




 By the way, The Interstate Highway System would cost 1 trillion dollars in today's money currency value.  




 As shown, Obama clearly stated that he wants to sign the TPP on the State of the Union. 














 commercial sells the stuff produced by industry. Industry creates goods from resources. Residential demands goods and money from jobs to buy. 




 just wondering... Will Yugo's speed roids be released in Crossover Souls? 




 Does Gilberto come since toronto can't have 4 dps? 




 Doesn't Toronto have more than 3 DPs? If so, then one player has to be traded before beginning of the season. 




 THIS A F-ING HUGE!!!! Congrats! 

Toronto will be a other fav teams this year other than the Revs, but Revs still #1 




 it is a good location but it might interfere with rail and subway congestion in the future, if rail travel were to increase. The area basically look like a giant industrial box with parking spaces and rail tracks. It is close to city and it is somewhat near the MBTA, so the area has many pluses. 




 It is a real possibility. The London Olympics had a full development of the area and the stadium was given for West Ham to use. if Boston wanted to repay the cost of the Olympics, they could charge a small tax on sporting events. Of course, there are other ways to fund it. 




 Other MLS teams should really consider these 2 players 




 Strange... When I first clicked on it, it was open.... 














 We don't need more (Fill in Name City) FCs or SCs in MLS. . 




 Wooh....Mark Bloom :O  




 Don't forget Vladimir Putin, but Russia did sent a delegation there.  




 While I support rail, more energy production, and more environmental regulations, I can see why Keystone can benefit us. I don't necessarily mind if Obama vetos or signs it. Though, I would prefer that Obama sign it. 




 Good Points. Though, I am just promoting an alternative view on the Keystone Pipeline that is different from other people.  




 I think that is the best approach. Keystone is worth conceding on. TPP isn't worth for Obama to compromise with Republicans on.  




 you should for fantasy. it is easier to follow than other sports. 




 J Jones should have went to Chicago Fire in a competitive point of view. 




 But... the International Space Station is one step to New World Order. Aren't Conservatives enraged?  




 True. I just don't want Obama to be labeled as "anti-energy" when he clearly isn't. Also, signing Keystone prevents Conservatives from blaming him for rising gas prices, if they were to rise. Also, I don't think many rural conservative voters understand the hazards of the Pipeline. I say let them deal with environmental hazards, if they leak. Though....Congress could just sign Keystone by bypassing Obama's veto and take all the blame, if environmental damages were to occur.  




 Does property values affect the buildings? if so, I will destory. :o 




 At the moment, my "central" city has tons of tall buildings. Are you suggesting zoning low density around it?  




 Ya. Though, for American Football, you can place a stadium anywhere and people will still go because it is only a weekly event. Plus, it is very inelastic in demand and supply due to low amount of games for millions of fans with limited seats.  




 Will the Olympic Stadium Proposal be in South Boston area? 

Many people are concerned about the cost of the Olympics in 2024. If the Revolution were to use the stadium, Would a small tax % added to the price of the seats there be used to repay the cost of the stadium? Is the Olympic Stadium entirely privately funded?  




 Wow.... Isn't that communist? :) 




 Agreed. I lean yes on the Olympics because it provides short-term business boost and global marketing of Boston. It could also help to boost infrastructure. However, I wished the city had a vote though.  




 Baker won because Falchuk got a lot of moderate liberal supporters. 

Falcuk's 3.3% of the voters would have gone to Coakley, if he weren't in the race. 

Though, it would still be even, if Lively weren't in the race. His supporters would have gone to Baker.  




 Good News to hear :) 




 My central city used to be mostly $$, $$$, and some $ people with manufacturing, high-tech, and $$ and $$$ businesses. It had good schools and good health services. I have neighboring cities with 100% $ people, $ business, and dirty. Then suddenly, $ people started rising and a lot of $$ and $$$ businesses +apartments started to decay or abandon. Jobs weren't demanded. Commute Time increasing. Budget was in free-fall....

To combat this:

1. I did readjust taxes in all my neighboring cities with 20% taxes on everything except dirty to encourage them to move to my major city. 

2. My city was in financial disaster. Budget Deficits and Low Cash. I decreased all residential taxes down to 4% to encourage people to come. Increased the Commercial and Industrial Taxes to around 11%. Slashed funding to health, police, ordinances. Ran on a surplus for some months. Slowly restored police and health funding. Took out 2 loans to get me to $500,000 in cash and roughly 1k to 2k budget deficit.

Now, my finances are in order mostly with positive demand for $ and $$ residential, but how I do actually grow and increase demand for industry and commercial? Any tips?  




 Resort with $$$ residential with lighthouse  




 Who will be those 4 Democratic Senators?

Though, I want Obama to sign Keystone, even though I am pretty liberal on environmental issues. 

Obama has other issues to draw lines before the 2016 election like Trade, Budgets, Taxation, etc. Making an environmental line on energy, when energy production has been increasing under Obama's administration isn't a good strategy for Democrats. 




 Perot would be rated as a moderate liberal today by Ontheissues.org 




 Actually, most pro-freetrade politicians have entered the Republican Party now, since most Third Way Democrats are voted out of office.  




 Yes, I agree. You don't want to build a small stadium of 20k seats too early with no expansion room with demand ever increasing. Then, you would have to build a 40k stadium in the future again. 




 Actually, HW Bush negotiated NAFTA. Clinton ran on it in the 1992 presidential campaign with most Republican Congress in support with around 40% of Congressional Democrats.  




 Seattle does the coverups as well in their giant stadium. I don't think it is matter of how the stadium looks, but rather how passionate the fanbase is... 




 Low Cost of Living. Republicans tend to cite "Low Cost of Living" of good economic indicators. 

Mississippi has a low cost of living as well.  




 It is more of automation and outsourcing that caused the decline. Unless you want Detroit and Rust Belt America to have a Race to the Bottom to outcompete, those declines are the consequences of free-trade deals.  




 Conservative Republicans will tell you that Democrat areas are the blame. However, Mississippi is almost a one party supermajority state legislature. All they need is some conservative Democrat Senators to swing votes.  




 Seriously. Jeb Bush is no moderate. he is just as conservative as anybody in the GOP but he is just more left than the rest on some issues such as immigration and education. Today's GOP is all about a purity test of conservatism. 




 They have themselves to blame. I am a millennial and I just voted in the previous election. it was my first election. 




 Atlanta (MLS) team is doing the stadium cover-up. If Atlanta succeeds in doing so, then the Revs can follow by covering up seats in a 60k seat stadium.  




 West Ham in the EPL is renovating London's Olympic stadium by adding seats to cover the track field.  




 in a decade, the revs can support 30k to 40k fans in the stadium, if MLS attendance continues to grow. if they can't, the revs can cover up seats in the new stadium. 




 We should have another NAFTA like debate. 




 I am glad infrastructure is the #1 priority 




 Just leave it as New Jersey MetroStars for the mean time. Then, they can change to New York MetroStars in the future? Buy New York Cosmos name?  




 True, which is why Public Transportation is more of an Urban and Inner-Belt Suburban areas. It is just unreasonable for people outside congested and density populated areas.

Based on total population, if everybody in urban + suburban voted based on more public transit in their areas (assuming everybody voted in the best interest of more public transit), more public transit would always win.  




 Yes. Many politicians do that as well, if they know how to do it effectively. Also, it depends on how motivated you are. - How you value Keystone against winning politically?

Example:

Notice how Republicans have "evolved" on gay marriage issues. Sometimes, they say for it, but at times against.  




 Um... That is because the basic capitalist system needs a lot of workers compared to few top management workers of a business. Everybody has to get to work. Poor People going to work is no different than how everybody else going to work. 

It isn't really regressive. Also, you do have options of public transit, which if you live near public transit, you could save money.
