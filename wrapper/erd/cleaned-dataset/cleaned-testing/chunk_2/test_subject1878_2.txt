 Off topic, not US politics, it's all about the UK. Not sure why they didn't leave a comment/flair. 

Also it's a blog and I think they only allow legitimate news outlets (though I may be thinking of another sub.)  




 Or maybe you could try keeping an open mind and see what the movie itself says to you...

 Celebrities get the spotlight. Why shouldn't they use that attention for something important?  




 No no, don't worry I'm just as terrified of girls as the rest of reddit, honest! Don't label me with that awful name implying I think women are poeple too!

 Yeah, how dare she try to use the attention she gets for something important! 

Everyone knows pretty women shouldn't be allowed to talk, unless it's to say words a man wrote for her!  







































 Yeah, the stages are a nice way of classifying things, but people don't necessarily progress from one to the next. Which is why I'm a big fan of John Cook's [Quantum theory of climate denial](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-cook/the-quantum-theory-of-climate-denial_b_5229539.html). 

What kind of facts you're presenting to a denier determines what stage of denial their response will be, and they'll collapse from one stage to another like quantum energy stuff... 




 Of the hundreds of comments making that joke, you're the first to actually set it up right. Kudos.  




 Ask mods to ban it? 

I dunno, I pm'd it the other day telling it to go away, but that didn't seem to do anything.  




 Try reading the article?  




 Here, you forgot this: /sarc. 

(I hope you forgot it anyway...) 




 Lol nice. 

I hate that bot. So useless and awful.  




 Yes, but they can't hold a note to save their life.  




 The public should recognize that this is not a money issue: this is environmental and cultural, the group said in a statement Wednesday. Opposition to the plan was overwhelming, Garry Reece, mayor of the town of Lax Kwalaams, said in an interview in Vancouver Tuesday, before the band leadership made a final decision.

 Weird, I thought I did when I submitted...I know I pulled up the study because I remember the name having that wierd Bs0 thing in the middle...

 Mods this is all about the debate on whether or and what kind of climate policy to create, so if you remove it because it isn't about a specific politician I'm going to cry. 

(Plus, it uses Michael 'Heckuva' Job Brownie' Brown as an example, so there's a politician!)  





























 Lol no! That's the Daily Mail you're thinking of! 




 I agree, but surely you're not referring to the outlet that broke the Snowden story as a poor source? 

Besides the NYT I don't know if anything is considered more reputable than the Guardian...

 Just make sure you fold the mirrors in this time!  




 Well then be a dear and use that power-stream to clean the grout while you're in there? thxbby! 




 This is why I'm never inviting you into my home, /u/j0be.  




 Yeah, I've never been a big fan of hydrogen either.  








































































































 Look for the R next to their name... 




 Deals with the **funding** of major **political** **donors**. 

On topic as per rule 2: "Private political actions and stories not involving the government directly, like demonstrations, lobbying, candidacies and **funding and political movements, groups and donors**."

So I'm kind of confused on how a story about a donor group's funding not being about funding, groups and donors...

Please restore, thanks! 




 Weird, thanks for the heads-up. 

Not going to bother resubmitting because odds are it'll just languish in /new anyway... 




 Not at all. Link can be provided in the comments. It's relatively rare for print-based outlets to include links to the study (though that is changing...)

 It'll be [The Asylum's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asylum) next Sharknado! 




 I have, twice. 

But let's try again: What's cheaper, a fracking rig and access to land where the earthquake would cause severe damage, or a couple of plane tickets? 

What's more effective at causing fear, an improvised explosive on a bus full of people, or a minor tremor? 

It's clear you have an interest in James Bond-esque fantasy, but until you get a little more believable I'd advise you not to quit your dayjob as an online goober.  




 Sorry, I reflexively downvote stupidity that thinks it's clever... 




 Where did I say any differently? 

Oh, in that straw man effigy you just constructed? Well proceed with the bonfire then.  




 /r/science has rules against the sort of psuedoscience that breitbart publishes consistently, so it's not just my bias but that pesky liberal bias many claim reality has... 




  Doing that might make fracking non-cost effective

Then no, it's not a different discussion. Fracking is used because it's the cost is just slightly lower than the price they can sell it for. If they can't pump the water underground without treatment, they can't frack. They can't frack, no earthquakes... 




 Yes, why aren't terrorists engaging in incredibly expense oil drilling technology that produces small earthquakes sometimes in some locations? 

Such a good question. You're so very very smart. I'm surprised the CIA hasn't picked you up to be a super-spy-genius-counter-terrorist yet.  




 Anything, even a random anecdotal comment on reddit, is more reliable than breitbart.

You may as well link to the National Enquirer or Daily Mail...
