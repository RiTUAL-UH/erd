 NNmagic is as legit as it gets my friend. 









 You don't know my life. You don't know my struggles. 




 "Do I belong here?" 
CUZ I LIVE IN A CREEEEK, I'M AN OTTER. WTF AM I DOING HERE? I DON'T BELONG HERE. 




 I don't get why this comment got downvoted to oblivion.  




 I'm happy for her. Like I said its not like I walk in and see this and say "Yay mom!" 




 Haha interesting point. My mom is a single mom and we talk freely about sex without too many details thankfully, but it's not like I'm giving my mom a high five for wanting to dance on a pole for old men.  









 Hence the red arrow.  









 They really outdid themselves with the artwork on the bicycle ass. I'm blown away. 




 Who the fuck would tattle? 




 More like Zack Snyder (300, Sin City, Sucker Punch, etc.) 




 I love pictures like that.

 I see y'all are... dealing with it... pretty well. :) 




 Reverse psychology... DUH. 




 Those pillows are full of fart.  




 Here's the original for anyone that cares:

 Because we have friends. 




 The "pretending to be asleep" face. Classic. 









 NoMo is amazing. Henley and Pralle are like hotels. You are not allowed to chill around... you need to be inside at all time if you want to chill (basically). At NoMo, doors can be open, you can walk up and down the aisle and meet different people or ask people for things or chill inside the quad which is in the middle of the housing. Really awesome, I didn't even live there last year. 




 Thanks! No bragging but occasionally me or my friends get cat called or get numbers passed to us but we never solicit, even though I'm tempted sometimes admittedly.  




 Know how to use fast pass. Know that you can ask for the front row on any attractions. Know that you can bring food and drink into Disneyland.  




 I only look like Grant because I'm Asian. Not opposed.

Weirdest rule... maybe that I'm not allowed to use the phrase "Olympics." I have to say "summer games" if I want to talk about them because the Olympics are owned by NBC and Disney owns ABC. 




 Neither. Just bored and thought y'all may be interested. 




 Working on it.  




 The people who do it love it. The crowds are what make it not monotonous. Each crowd responds differently. There are always new ad libs on every boat. 




 Orlando info is true. The fact that it's underground is an after thought. Pirates of The Caribbean ride at Disneyland is mostly underground for what it's worth. 

And the head info is false. 




 I dislike the Tiki Room songs more than Small World. 




 Thank you! I'm being very careful.  




 The only times I see children cry are when they are spoiled and don't get what they want from their parents (candy, toys, food), when they are too scared to ride a ride their parents are taking them on, and (most relevant to me daily) when they don't make height checks. 




 Soak in cold water first to get the dye out. If you don't like the sizing after, warm soak it for 30min. 




 I'm not saying anything that could get me terminated. 




 It may be because this is not called a Fast Pass. It's called a Guest Assistance Card. These are awesome for people that need them. All you need to do is go to Guest Relations and tell them why you need them and what your disability restricts you from doing ie standing too long. People abuse this shit all the time and it sucks. 

The card lets the holder and up to 6 guests go through the shortest route to the attraction. 




 Ohhhh yes! I couldn't tell if y'all were visiting the school and stoked about it or students. I was at Big Thunder that day. 




 I like the Remember! fireworks spectacular because it showcases the beautiful and nostalgic and classic attractions of Disneyland past and present. 

I get paid a little over $9
