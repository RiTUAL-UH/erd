 hey guys im trying to create a 4-2-3-1 formation with two b2b midfielders but i think it lacks a bit of defensive steel. do you guys think it can work.because im doing a save with arsenal and i wanted to make ramsey and wilshire my midfield pair but im not sure two b2b's can work 




 me too :) thanks again for your help  




 hey i unistalled it. and it still didnt work so i started a new save and it was fine. guess it was that specific save. weird  




 i dont think its terrible to believe in god. im not religious and i dont believe in god but if some people want to read stories and pray and if that makes them close with there friends and family and if that gives them rules and morals thats great. and i hate fanatical atheists more than fanatical religious people. yeah science is great but fuck off and leave everyone alone. bring on preachy atheists who wanna argue 




 will leave it for a few hours hopefully that will do it. thanks for your help 




 ok will do. i tried doing this and it was suck on 0% for ages should i just leave it for a few hours ? 




 i have 6gb of RAM and 278 of 421 free. when i play i have nothing on in the background. its very sudden and has only just got really slow in the last few days its very weird. would a system restore do anything ?  




 definitely Ronaldo with all due respect to Ribery Messi and Ronaldo are in a differant class to him. Ronaldos had such a stunning year a much better year than messi. he deserves it 




 hey guys i have not had any problems with fm at all regarding running the game. but suddenly a few days ago i load up my save and it is horrendously slow takes ages when i change anything on the tactics screen takes ages to advance forward and to play games. generally really slow and it lagging a lot. i have no issue with memory on my laptop and i have never had a problem like this before and i don't really know what i can do. any help would be appreciated 
p.s i have england as a playable league and all the other leagues as view only.  




 oh wow i always read amazing stories about people getting lower league teams to the prem and i think wow i wanna do that but i never have the commitment to compete in the lower leagues  




 wow awsome i always get bored when i start with a lower league team wish i found it fun managing lower league :( 




 wow that sounds great ! never tried to play in a league to enhance the reputation   




 hey guys big fan of this subreddit. anyway i want to hear about saves where you completely dominated winning everything for years and years. i had a good fm 13 save with arsenal i won 11 titles in 13 years 8 of them doubles 4 of them trebles and 2 of them quadruples. lemme hear you guys show of your most dominant saves !

 Winning the league and cup double with everton. In my first season  




 Get a foothold in Scandinavia some incredible talents at insanely cheap prices  




 i always prefer using youngsters but like a few people here said its better to have a mix  




 they might want a meeting with you to discuss staying  




 maybe an advanced playmaker ? 




 thats awsome ! in one save i won the title 11 times in 13 years with a two and a half star right winger he  was a very important cog in my team  




 Bendtner whenever i play with arsenal he always seems to play a decent part in my season  




 sell him mate ! (unless league rival)

 yeah i've come across quite a few atheists on here who act like a complete tosser  not saying they all do its the minority for sure. it just seems unnecessary and the post is what do you hate most about Redditors and that's what I hate most if thats ok with you that's all im saying 




 excuse me ? 




 atheists on here who go out of there way to be a dick to religious people yeah im not religious and i don't believe in any of that stuff but i understand it helps some people live there lives and it helps some people be a good person. leave them alone for fuck sake
