 Brian Hoyer.......fuck 




 I want to see a sack on Palmer so bad 









 Good game Guys but i don't think our defense can hold much longer. I'm impressed though. To the Cardinals! 




 Speaking of Bored

You're the worst! 




 I'll take 2 TD's from Royal please with a side of 50+ yards 




 Same with Brown and Bell -___- 




 Antonio Brown please get me 1 TD PLEASE!!!!! 









 They're showing the Vikings-Falcons game I yard of the 49ers game? Why????? 
























 Losing feeling in my toes. 




 Winner winner chicken dinner 




 Zodiac, I personally think this is Fincher's masterpiece. 




 Why run at all? 




 Yeahhhh if you could chuck a deep pass to Crabtree for a TD that'd be greatttt.  




 Pick 6 with Fitz calling it now 




 Why 2 fucking lost touchdowns FUCKING TWO!!!!!!! 




 I got Alfred Morris for a TD first quarter  




 Remember when the Skins beat Dallas for the division and you just felt we we're finally relevant again and had a victory that meant something big? Then we ended up winning 3 games the following season. I want to see this team win again, I want that great feeling again this Sunday soooo bad. Let's hope it happens. 




 Make it happen browns 




 Thanks for having faith in us Bill. 









 oh I know its not, let me dream man. 




 Hopefully Rg3 and Alfred Morris. 




 Do you think you can actually win or make it to the Super Bowl? Do you think your team can win your division? Can you're team win more than you did last year? What fantasy can you actually see come true this season? 




 I really hope this isn't a blow out, but im getting that feeling. Which team will be on what end though, that's the question. 




 Probably no Super Bowl this year, but can we get at least over 5 wins? Can Rg3 come back to form? Can we sweep the Eagles, Cowboys, or Giants? Can we win the divsion??? What is your fantasy that you can see actually happening? 




 Something something every thread
