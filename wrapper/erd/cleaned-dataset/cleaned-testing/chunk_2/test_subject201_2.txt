 I know, I love this picture. Shes almost 3 years old now and still melts my heart. *tear  




 Very rare indeed.  









 I don't know man. I guess these people think their art critics or they dont approve of stencil work.  









 She's almost [3 years old now](http://imgur.com/rapbStW). we have 2 JRTs and there like our kids. I love when they dream of running or swimming and there little paws start moving. 




 I have some blue and pink peony right now but haven't got that far into the project to decide. 




 But... blowing stuff up is... fun... 




 Anyone have any good ideas for some good names? 




 why yes they are! But I am more interested in seeing a (self propelled)  mortar launch out of a rocket in mid flight and also address the challenge of making it successful. What I think may happen is once the mortars launch out of the rocket, the rocket and the mortar will push against each other and just push apart, making the mortar go up a bit more and the empty rocket shaft go down. Kinda like repelling magnets in zero gravity. Also this is just a first draft of simply an idea. I thought it would be cool. 




 I still have a lot of kinks to work out. This is pretty much a first draft of a cool idea I had, so not much effort went into the physics of it yet. Thank you for your concern for my safety. I already play it very safe and you are very right about a fail to lift scenario. That would really suck but I would treat it like you said, as a loaded gun. Maybe I will even go as far as launching it from inside my jeep and film it instead of standing next to it just in case.  




 Its nice to hear some support! Everyone is like... bad idea, illegal, wont work. Like I said, this is just an idea I thought to draw out so I wouldn't forget. I wasn't really planing on making it but now I want to make this or something similar . So far I have some great ideas for how to make it work and work safely. Also yes, it wouldn't really matter if the mortars ejected properly (especially at night) because the main goal is to just get the mortars up in the air with fuse lit, so wasn't really planning on being able to recover a (still in one piece) rocket. Even though that would be nice. I will make a video when I get the time to make this happen! 




 This would make an awesome pic for r/photoshopbattles 




 I am a man with a kids mentality. Get it right 




 Thanks for your words of wisdom. This was just an idea I drew up one boring night. I've posted a lot of these ideas but for some reason this got a lot more attention maybe because of some controversy. But I pride myself on being safe and I probably wont end up making this. If I do something like it in the future I will think of your words. 




 yea good call, thanks. I just did this as a cool idea and I love the feedback. Ill prob start off small with a 1inch mortar and a nice strong engine and long nose. If anything im inspired to make it work now. And of course take all the safty precautions.  




 haha im imaging that happening and my inner pyro is happy. And awesome idea on the double one casing mortars btw. thank you kind sir 




 Thanks ill check that out

 This is just a glimpse into my twisted mind. Probably not something I would carry through with for a few reasons. Not sure if its legal and its defiantly dangerous. And yes I would need to do some real world calculations when it comes to weight and other factors. This is just a concept I though would be cool. 




 If its made out of a shopping bag its parashoot. haha Thanks bud 




 Yea it probably wouldn't work with a c6-5, if at all. The idea of a longer rocket is something I overlooked. I got to caught up in the concept of how to get the fireworks in the air. 




 Yea I understand. This is just an idea I had that I probably wont go through with. I really have no idea if this would work but this is a glimpse into my mind.
 









 Much appreciated! 



















 As you attorney I recommend to wear this on halloween. 
 



















 I don't understand. why can't you use those terms? I see them everywhere.  




 Hey thanks for the heads up. I rely to much on spell check and the rage maker doesn't underline misspelled words. my bad... my bad 




 What the fuck is this? I know its a dick but how is it relevant? 




 it was the *not bad* face that got me. 




 haha thank you. 100% true. Holding in that laugh felt like an eternity.   









 No, I didn't! but thank you for that link! His lyrics are so deep and meaningful backed with some of the most relaxing and soothing music. I can spend hours reading lyrics. LCW is a great album and I kinda got that feeling it was about that. Thanks again for the link man!  




 Modest Mouse for me is awesome when im in deep.  




 We've already talked talked to our vet and they said it would  be fine to breed her with a small stud. she is an english jack and normal is between 9 to 14 pounds so she is in the norm. We also have a 13 pound female but prefer the temperament and looks of the 10 pound. We plan to keep most of the puppies ourselves and only give a couple to close friends that we know would have time and the love they need. If they need round the clock nursing there is not a problem, I am home all the time and if I go out my wife is home. we don't leave our dogs unattended. and yes the vet would do shots, tail docking and dew claws and any other care they may need from a professional. We did a lot of research be fore we bought our dogs the ten pound is 3 years  old and the 13 is 2.  The breeder we got them from is no longer breeding and we would like to have more like her. we have looked for other breeders for english jacks but they are not very common where we are. we have thought a lot about this and would not do anything to harm either of our babies. I hope this answer all of your questions. 




 I have a 10lb female English Jack Russell Terrier. She is a pretty small Jack and me and my wife are looking to breed her. We live in Maine and are looking for a Stud but we want to find a small male because we are worried about her small size and that the pregnancy will hurt her. Does anybody have any advice on breeding small dogs and or know of any place to find a small English Jack Russell stud?
