 What a crank! Brain altering nanobots in fifteen years? Check that against the development time for a simple, pharmacological compound, which does not include "user may experience hacking and occasional malware" in its list of potential side effects. If Kurzweil is more than a figurehead in the department of engineering, trotted out to garner publicity, then it may soon be time to sell your Google stock. 




 This stunt is not space travel, only the world's most expensive amusement ride. The pompous billionaire prattles about orbiting Virgin Galactic hotels, yet orbital flight would require an expenditure of approx. 18 fold more energy and a much more robust vehicle.    




 Kevin Kellys book What Technology Wants (2010) has convinced me that our technological development is now an autonomous entity  the Technium. The Technium has an imperative to expand beyond this planet  it is difficult to imagine it will be content to rest, even inside a Matrioshka brain, to contemplate its virtual navel. So, the solution to the Fermi Paradox may reduce to one fundamental race: Can the Technium escape its resource limitations before it experiences a disabling shock?

Presently, the Technium depends on two critical planetary resources for its progress. One is the potential energy content of the Earths crust, which is stored primarily in fossil fuels and concentrated deposits of metallic ores and minerals. The Technium is rapidly consuming the most useful of these given resources, and the lowest grade deposits may not support its extra-planetary expansion. The second critical resource is the Biosphere. While tigers, whales and redwoods are of no consequence to it, a sufficient quantity of Humanity must survive until the Technium is competent enough to jettison this component, as it would a placenta. As the Biosphere appears to be resilient enough to achieve this goal, the race to achieve a space-faring technology before resource collapse is theoretically winnable, if not for the threat of disabling shocks.

The source of these disasters can be endogenous to the Technium or purely external. External shocks include not only the odd asteroid strike or eruption of a super volcano, but statistically likely events like a devastating Carrington event or global pandemic. The most notable of the endogenous threats is the ongoing disruption of carbon cycle, which could result in the premature destruction of the Biosphere, but the most likely shocks always arise from the unreliable Human component, which is prone to wars and financial idiocy. For this reason, the Technium must soon gain a greater control of governments and markets to provide them with a purposeful direction.

Once it achieves an escape velocity, there will remain threats on a larger scale, such as supernovas, but the space-faring Technium will expand beyond those in comparatively short time. However, that we find no evidence of an alien rival may strongly suggest that collapse or senescence of the Technium is imminent, and the remains of all of its gadgetry will be a collection of unique fossils residing in a thin stratum of Earths crust.
 




 Two excellent primers on the subject are If the Universe Is Teeming with Aliens WHERE IS EVERBODY?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life by Stephen Webb (2002) and Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe by Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee (2003). Stephen Webbs fifty solutions run from solid science to sci-fi whimsical (e.g. we are living in a galactic nature preserve), while Ward and Brownlee are, respectively, a paleontologist and an astrophysicist and argue that this planet has numerous advantages, that while not unique, are unlikely to be coincident elsewhere. Interestingly, the Ward and Brownlee book recapitulates about a third of Wards solutions, but with more scientific rigor.

Enrico Fermi first proposed the paradox while having lunch with his fellow atomic weapon scientists. The others were discussing the first flurry of UFO sightings, to which the laconic Fermi commented, So, where is everybody? He was famous for an ability to ask the essential question. I consider the Fermi Paradox to be just that, our essential, existential question.

Of the fifty solutions, Ray Kurzweil chooses We are the first, the Singular, advanced civilization in this Galaxy. He must hold this as an article of faith, for otherwise, those artificially intelligent, nanotech assembling, alien robotic probes would have already arrived. They would be turning this precious blue dot into a blob of grey goo feedstock for their own galactic computer, and Ray Kurzweil would not achieve his upload to deity status. It is ironic that if he succeeds in his current work at Google, the Artificial Intelligence he helps to create might be the Great Filter that extinguishes this nascent, planetary civilization. Dwell on that, all you Friends of the Future.
 




 This is the NYT Opinion article cited by Kunstler in his current CFN. A short article summarizes the attached, 12 minute video segment, part of a Pulitzer series called RETROREPORT. The video is another predictable hit piece directed at our unfortunate straw man, Paul Ehrlich, but is more notable as an exhibition of that notorious, renegade afterbirth of the hippie era, Stewart Brand. From his beginnings as Ehrlich disciple, an acid dropping Merry Prankster, and founder of the low-tech Whole Earth Catalogue, Stewart Brand co-evolved (that is, re-branded) with the emergent corporate world to find a more lucrative living as an event planner, and is now a leading spokes-model for Techno-Cornucopia. In the video, he warns, The point at which the population peaks around nine billion, in the 2040s or 50s the story will not be, Oh my god, how horrible, it will be, oh my god, were running out of people!

And if you really want to fume, read Re-Brandeds April 21, 2015 article in Aeon Magazine, titled Rethinking Extinction. Contrary to all evidence, it seems there is no ongoing Sixth Extinction Event. In fact, The trends are favorable. Conservation efforts often appear in the media like a series of defeats and retreats, but as soon as you look up from the crisis-of-the-month, you realize that, in the aggregate, conservation is winning.
 









 While climate science is making rapid advances, how quickly and to what extent this amplified greenhouse effect will perturb the ocean currents will remain uncertain  for any analysis, these represent a most complex heat engine. In my original comment, I did not intend to suggest a Canfield Ocean (and its Green Sky) is an imminent event, only that the paleontological record does suggest this as a mechanism for previous mass extinctions, and that experts in the field do find an ominous parallel in our ongoing alteration of this planets atmosphere. I am certain that most of the followers of Collapse would agree this is the ultimate monstrous crow; the basic chemistry and physics of the process are, frankly, undeniable, and I believe we can now hear the flap of its wings.

However, this distant, future event should not concern Disingenuous. There is no danger of NBA cancelling the current Finals for a Green Sky.
