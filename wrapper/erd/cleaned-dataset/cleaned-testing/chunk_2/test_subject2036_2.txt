 Sorry for the late response! I loved Korea. Soeul is so much fun. I'm really into hip hop and it has some really cool clubs that just play rap music. Food was amazing, people were nice and I really wanna go back! I flew with Korean air which is a really nice airline.  




 i just flew to korea on a 12 hour flight! Okay so if the anxiety is about plane crashes, there is utterly no reason to be afraid. Even taking into account the plane crashes of 2014, the odds of your plane crashing are unfathomably low, they aren't even worth considering. Flying is literally one of the safest modes of transport compared to driving etc. Also, long haul flights are always in big juggernaught planes that dont take no shit from heavy turbulence. literally feels like ur just in a room for 12 hours.  




 You need to have more confidence in yourself man! Nothing bad is going to happen. For all you know she is more nervous having invited you over.  




 Fuck the king! 




 So would you recommend I just don't read it and accept the ending of Adam's version? 




 Okay so I have two questions. Was it the Vogons or the Grebulons who destroyed the earth? I don't understand which did it. In the wiki here http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Mostly_Harmless it says  "Earth is destroyed by the Grebulon commander." But I thought it was the vogon using the new guide to destroy every possible iteration of the earth?

Second question, is it worth reading and "And Another Thing..." or is it not considered part of the series because its not written by Adams?

Thanks! 




 holy shit man... That was really well put! The analogy of the butterflies and the garden. Makes me really want to focus on myself and feel happy. 




 Thanks for the response, you kinda changed my perspective. I guess I do get so caught up in seeing all these happy couples that I forget the other side of the coin. I will try to focus on being happy regardless of my circumstances :) 




 Don't really know where else to post this so I thought id just write about it here for therepeuatic reasons. So yesterday was valentines day and I went out with my sister and her friends. Whilst out I couldn't help looking at couples and feeling so envious. I am 19 and I've never really had a serious girlfriend. I feel like being in a relationship is a huge aspect of life that i simply haven't experienced yet. I'm not socially awkward or anything. I just feel I've never really built a relationship with girls that I know. Tonight I decided to go to a coffee shop and get a coffee and read my book to relax but I'm literally just sitting here feeling utterly lonely. On the way over here I kept walking past restraunt windows and seeing happy couples eating and it literally just makes me feel like I want that so much. The whole situation reminds me of that George rr Martin quote about how being lonely at a party hurts so much.

Anyways I just wanted to write this because I feel writing makes me feel better. Have a great night.  




 I'm the same. I sometimes convince myself i have diseases because diseases always happen to the unwary and unexpecting. If I believe i have the disease then the chances of me actually having the disease are lowered. I especially say this about stds. I'm crazy 




 Haha dude I'm the exact same. The left side of my head always throbs and feels like there is pressure building up inside but I've had cat scans and everything and it's fine. My neck is also riddled with lumps, my glands are always swollen, I have a lump on one of my testicles etc... I've had it all scanned and it's fine but my body is literally proof that it's never as serious as you think. The funniest part is my lumps only rose after I would be constantly pressing my neck worrying about lumps. Anxiety has a way bigger effect on your body than you realise.
