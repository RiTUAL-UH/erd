 You should get more characters to increase the number of possible combinations. That's where the fun of the game. You can send your low level chars to higher level dungeons with your main chars to power level. 

I do really like b) though. Since the end game dungeon can only be run once per character, it would be useful to have something that helps with levelling new recruits.
