 Came here to say the food, was not disappointed


Also people like the riddle/adventure/ancient legend combo that's present in a lot of the books, as well as the idea of cute talking animals 




 Also Jay Wright has done an amazing job this year, but I really feel like Chris Holtmann deserved Coach of the Year. 




 The way people are talking in here it's like Arcidiacono turned into Aaron Craft 




 Halley's Comet appearances 




 I agree, take an upvote. I'm just saying it sucks, and they're a good basketball team. It's a shitty situation when a team like Murray State gets 1 chance to prove they're worthy, and a team like nameamajorconferencebubbleteam gets 10.  




 It's not the analysis, it's the spirit of it. He's right. 




 I just said I don't think they deserve an at-large. I said I think they're a good basketball team. Which they are. 




 In November. With injuries.

Have you seen them play this year? 




 I think I'm being downvoted for things said elsewhere, not here. Which is funny but whatever.

Well, best of luck to you guys! Would've been cool to see what you could've done with a full year of Rice 




 That joke made me spittake at my desk. The Limewire thing hahahaha 




 Russian Roulette 




 Well that's your shot right there 




 Said it below, don't have a team. So at least you've got that going for you, my school has no chance and will never have a chance at the tournament 




 I'd flair up if I had a team! I'm just a college hoops fan, I went to UCSD, whose men's bball program is bad even for D2.

You guys have got a shot. How do you feel about Groce?

And I think that's debatable, Murray State is legit man. Once they got their full roster in place they started on that tear. That's not to say they'd be any better necessarily, I just don't think it's cut and dried. 




 Look, I don't think most people in here think Murray State's resume should get them in. I don't think anyone will have complaints if they don't get in.

Where it's bothering me is people acting like they're not a good basketball team. If you don't think this team is good, you either haven't seen them play, or have an axe to grind with them/mid-majors in general.  




 Hahah not at all, it's just a reddit thread. I'm more stoked it happened, but thanks for the offer! 




 The NBAPA are the ones blocking the age limit from going up. It's an owner thing. 




 Holy shit we came up with that at the same time. Take an upvote 




 Things you can say about the tournament bubble, but not your girlfriend 




 Lol it means Illinois fans are scared they won't get in and are taking that angst out by shitting on a truly exciting mid-major team who got beat by Belmont playing a great, great game in the OVC title game. 




 How'd that work out for ya? 




 The only people who hate you are the ones who are afraid you're gonna take their bid away. 




 I've never seen that GIF of Crean adjusting his pants in the comments, and it was pure gold 




 Spoken like a true fan of a truly underwhelming bubble team 




 That's the impression I've gotten from a distance too. It's just weird, I figured he'd be a solid head coach. 




 Not even begrudging respect? :P 




 Kinda surprised Snaer didn't get thrown in until now, dude was amazing. 




 Yeah I remember, Robbie Hummel was one of my favorite players. That team was forreal.

I didn't realize Etwaun had stuck in the NBA though, thought he got bounced. Then my roommate was watching the Thunder-Bulls game and I saw him hit a game-winner. Made my day haha, I was so pleasantly surprised. 




 I got a chance to go to the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 in Anaheim last year. Even as a person with no vested rooting interest, I was captivated. So worth it. You should go if you have the chance. 




 I feel like the ACL gods owe you guys a couple. 




 Me too! As always, it'll be fun as hell no matter what!

Hey just curious, as an Alabama fan, how do you feel about Anthony Grant's coaching job? 




 Fair enough for last year.

I hope it goes without saying that last year is not this year, though. 




 Famous last words. 




 Nova has lost exactly twice. How often is this phenomenon happening in your opinion? 




 It won't happen in this climate because SDSU is much stronger than UCLA at the moment, and UCLA wants to be able to claim supremacy in California when recruiting.

Although Sean Miller runs California in actuality. 




 Honestly every time I've watched them (admittedly it's been the bigger games, many of which have been losses), I've thought they have no fight at all. It's seemed to me that when another team makes a run, it just drags on and on because Utah doesn't have the fight in them.

The one exception to this is Brandon Taylor. The only one consistently playing hard when they're losing. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they were about to get upset in the Round of 64 and Taylor put the whole team on his back for crunch time.  




 The 11-13 lines are so dangerous this year it's crazy 




 Better get through Boise. Team is legit. 




 Dasean Butler is so underrated. And the moment with Huggins at the Final Four literally brings tears to my eyes every time. 




 Juan Dixon got me into college hoops. Dude was awesome. 




 Not saying they can't do it, saying that the Sweet 16 at the very least is a tall order. When you say you don't expect to make it that far, but then that you expect to make it further than 75% of the teams in the tournament, it's a confusing contradiction haha.

I was lucky enough to be at both of the Arizona-SDSU games last year (I'm a UCSD alum haha, I live in the area), they were both fantastic atmospheres and fantastic games. 




 Which I understand. If Kansas is seeded higher than Wisconsin on the 1-68 true seed list, which is what my statement is predicated on and what I mean when I say "if they pass them", they'd get first crack at the Midwest geographically, which sends Wisconsin elsewhere. 




 Woah that's potentially interesting. The Waves have played you guys tough, it's Sabonis and Wiltjer that have killed them.

Veeeeerryyy interesting. 




 I giggled at that call. 

I'm mostly excited at the prospect of you guys getting in cuz the Paladins is a dope mascot. 




 I'm still just mystified at how his arms manage to look short on TV.

Good luck to you guys, I think you have backdoor second-weekend potential if you get the right matchup 




 Props to you for actually realizing it. I feel like so many Syracuse fans I've talked to don't even acknowledge that that game was close. 




 Syracuse-UNC Asheville a couple years back. Should've happened, refs took it away from the Bulldogs.

Southern took Gonzaga to the wire 2 years ago. Coastal Carolina was winning in the second half against Virginia last year. Albany hung with Florida last year.

I feel like people assume these games are always blowouts; a lot of them are, yeah, but many of them are not. It's a lot closer than we think. 




 That's pretty far 




 Putting my foot in my mouth. Watching him play his arms look so short. But apparently he's got the wingspan of a goddamn condor lol 




 Well if Kansas passes Wisconsin on the two line it's possible. So if Wisconsin loses in the B1G tournament to someone bad and Kansas wins the Big 12, there's a chaaaaance. But a small one. 




 Yeah this is just not true 




 Anya is nowhere near long enough to be effective against UK unless they just get bullied. Which I doubt happens. 




 First to 90 wins! 




 VCU is entirely different without Briante Weber. 




 I've been making the argument that you guys have no chance.


But hell if I don't have hope you guys get in anyway 




 Well it is Bleacher Report. 




 Man Robbie Hummel was the best. 




 You guys expect to lose? Damn.  




 That's fair enough. I've seen a lot of reactions all over the place, guess that's what happens when you have a massive fan base. Northwestern is definitely a trap game too, they're a decent squad. 




 Shiiit I didn't mean to be a douche. My bad. 




 Curious. Are there Indiana fans who are still confident about tournament chances?

EDIT: I'm a douche sometimes. 




 Should've missed the first one too 




 His reactions are the best 




 It's been awesome to see them get on this weird little mini-roll. 

That being said, don't really want them to steal a bid from Green Bay and/or Valpo. 




 Big South was crazy yesterday, so much fun watching all the ends of the games at work 




 It's the same reason they don't have a tournament, so it doesn't fuck up their school schedules. But then one of them makes the big dance and fucks it up anyway 




 3, 4, 5, 7 for me. 2 was my next team out. 




 Grade inflation abounds, this is just one of the more comical examples. 




 With Dez its worth it tho 




 9th seeded Longwood* 




 Totally agree with what you're saying functionally; we should have clear path foul rules. Just pointing out that layups and dunks, the likes of which clear path fouls are committed to prevent, are missed far more often at this level than at the professional level 




 I feel like for timeouts, they should be able to just take less with them to the last minute. Every time I see Roy Williams call 4 timeouts in the last minute of play I want to throw something at him. 




 If you have possession and you're sliding on the floor, it's almost always called a travel. It's considered moving your pivot foot (technically) 




 I agree with your larger point, but there are a significant number of layups and dunks that get missed in exactly this situation in college hoops haha. 




 Yeah it's supposed to be sub-100 RPI are bad losses. Yale's 69th right now. 




 Nahh you didn't shit the bed, Boatright and Shabazz just destroyed your backcourt. Little different.  




 Khaliff Wyatt was the truth in that game. You guys deserved to win 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_cat_bounce

Basically just means that even something that is sucking can see a small positive reversal after their huge fall before settling into newfound suckitude. 




 Hahaha dammmmmit.  




 And the first 1 seed of the conference tournaments goes down! It's in the air baby 




 Upset alert in the Big South! 1 seed Charleston Southern trails by 8 at the under 4 timeout 




 All good :) 




 No they're not. 




 [From the Conference Tournaments Day 4 Thread](http://www.yalebulldogs.com/sports/m-baskbl/2011-12/releases/20120125cbh295) 




 Oh yeah that ban was definitely only done when they realized they probably wouldn't make it anyway. 




 Honestly I think it depends what BYU does. If BYU only loses to Gonzaga in the WCC tournament, they have a good shot to get in the Big Dance, and both of Gonzaga's losses will be to tournament teams (1 on the road in OT to a fellow 2 seed). Hard to take that away.

And honestly, even if they lost in the WCC tournament it'd be hard to knock em off the 2 line. 




 Betting Boeheim doesn't stay through the sanctions. He's seemed bored and frustrated for awhile now. 




 The Top 25 was more as a recognition of a perfect conference record and not having lost in a really long time, than having actually earned their way into the polls.

I wish there was room for an at-large like Murray State, but the way selection works, pretty much every bubble team would have to take an awful loss in the conference tournaments to even think about it. 




 I just started a new job and I'm slightly worried about my performance in the next few weeks. 




 I honestly don't know how much you can read into this one though. Once the blitz was on, it was on. This game was only contested for like 10 minutes, and the last 30 were just playing out the conclusion that was already written.

Davidson deserved to win, and win big, but VCU is better than this, even in the last three games, even without Briante. IMO.


That being said you could dead cat bounce through your next 2 games and get smoked in the tournament. Who knows. 




 Sadly nope. No beef to the resume at all 




 Yes yes so much yes
