 Sir. That's not nice. Your wife is a very nice lady just ask the mailman, pool boy and gardener. 




 Then why are you complaining. Exclusives are a reality, it happens on all platforms. The entire concept of this subreddit is about how your platform is better and more exclusionary compared to console peasants just seems kind of hypocritical to be mad about console segregation when this is what the subreddit stand for and that we're better then the console peasants.  









 You're on PCmasterrace complaining about console segregation. Really? that's the entire purpose of pc masterrace, you're just mad it's on xbox.  




 Regardless of rather or not they were looking for the one shit starter, the men dealt with their issues, unless the women were all chosen because of their personality or lack thereof it could be used as representative. Not to a fault but close enough, i'm pretty sure if the producers chose women who were bitchy they also chose men the same way but still one group overcame this.  




 This was years ago around when i was 10 or 11, it was at this go kart track in Wisconsin dells. Family vacation, me, my sister and her boyfriend were all racing on the track, we were really into it, i love go kart racing and we got extremely competitive between the three of us. I sped ahead, leaning into the curves, began meticulously taking out the kids who all seemed to be Suburban tourist from bumfuck Dakota. I would ram their carts, knock them into walls and do my best to spin them out, i turned a simple go kart race with kids who some were 8 years old or younger into a mix between mario kart racing and death race. At one point i ended up in a fender bender with a kid i purposefully rammed so hard. I was young so i don't remember the extent of the damages but he either suffered a concussion or whiplash. In my defense i was a huge fan of mario, i was go karting and i could not help but get my head into that perspective blame the video games not me!!

Suffice it to say the people who run the track were not please, me and my sis being city kids could care less though. It was the dells, there were a dozen other go kart tracks across the street and within a 2 block walking distance. We cursed them out and walked off, they told us never to come back, we did eventually and they for some reason were still mad,my mom later heard of this in was.... extremely dis-pleasured.

TL:DR Went off into a mario kart trance, gave kid whiplash, cursed out go kart operators and strutted away like a dbag. Mom whooped my butt.  




 Sup fellow 9 goaters, kick out all 6 goaters they can't reddit with us.  









 She's not bi, the imgur did not even explain that fully. She was pretending to be bi, you know like lindsay lohan and miley cyrus. Magic powder is not drugs, jesus it's a trope of fantasy with love potions and magic spells. Read it fully and stop trying to get pissed off over nothing.  














 Isn't it said that we lived in such a self absorbed word where we believe anyone gives a fuck about your MLP fetish or weird porn searches. The list is a lie eat cake and stfu.  




 Good. Fuck your grandfather nazi dog. Sorry for your other grandfather who died who fought on the eastern front.  




 Because one was fighting to stop the imperialistic genocidal racial supremacist expansion of two empires. One being the Hitler Reich and the other being the imperial Japanese army, both who committed massive crimes against humanity. Your comparison is the equivalent to saying why is luke skywalker awesome for blowing up the death star killing thousands of imperial soldiers in the process yet imperials are guilty for blowing up alderaan. Gee idk maybe because the imperials just blew up a civilian planet that's nominally peaceful versus a planet destroying super weapon under the control of a xenophobic genocidal empire. 

Now is that a black and white comparison which is not fair since in war it's a moral gray zone? yes it's unfair but ww2 is probably the closest we can come to a black and white narrative in concerns to historical warfare. While yes the us might have it's own issues, racism, and prejudice at the time, it was not outright directly trying to exterminate entire groups of people, while it might have put Japanese citizens in concentrations camps it did not do horrific human experimentation like the japanese unit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731, it did not force them on death marches and it certainly did not force the women into sex slavery. In this is coming from a guy who actually admired a German general by the name of Rommel, who also knows the common German soldiers were not ideologically the same as the nazi's at the end of the day they were on their side in died defending them.

Also because the Germans were the aggressors, they invaded Poland, started militarization which all led to the eventual crushing of germany. Their crimes and horrors they inflicted on the russians in stalingrad paid back ten fold when the soviets came to take berlin. You want to know why Germans do not celebrate these men? it's simple because they like Hitler were the architect of their misery, if you want to know why a German mother does not celebrate her brave forefather soldiers ask her about the post fall of Berlin soviet rape sprees and killings. 


 









 So originally saw this movie on netflix and fell in love, it my was the first time i had ever seen a asian epic movie without flying people or mystical warriors. So i've been kind of dissapointed that their does not seem to be any info on the other films coming out in english or any information regarding us releases.  




 Indeed. LONG LIVE ZIONISM. 




 So the title for the new total war game  based on warhammer has really been annoying me. I mean come on total war: warhammer it's the most unimaginative and uncreative name for a game, even metal gear revengeance at-least had some type of thought process behind it. I think TOTAL WAAAGH or TOTAL WAAAGHAMMER would be much better, the core fanbase would of course recognize it and newer players would be more interested in this title then something called total war: warhammer the rehammering 




 Nah they have a new algorithm. It automatically has avoid rock slingers and terrorist features built in. It also comes with gps coordinate feature so you can email the idf to send in the airstrike if you take a wrong turn in need a immediate shock in awe on some "peaceful" demonstration by terrorist.  




 "Wow. You literally don't know what you're talking about.
this all falls down to the same claim that to the rate of which college age women will be raped
Are we still talking about how many rapes aren't reported? No we're talking about how you get the estimates you're claiming.  Because this is so far from the truth it's astounding. The FBI/Department of Justice has routinely estimated the number of unreported rapes in the USA every year. Here is a report which estimates that 65% of rapes/sexual assaults went unreported from 2006-2010." where's the report then?"

"This is wholly different from the 1-in-5 figure, which does not come from a 1980s study. Did you actually read a word of what you just linked me? Because in the very opening paragraph it talks about it coming from a 2007 study, and the chief warning from the researchers is that their study was too narrow, only focusing on two schools, and so shouldn't be used as a broad strokes thing." Sorry i was referring to this. http://brown-spectator.com/2013/04/lies-damn-lies-and-rape-statistics/ which cited the original 1 in 5 stat. 

"Because of that, a new study sought to get new data with over 1000 respondents across 500+ schools nationwide, and guess what they found? One in five women and one in twenty men in college said they'd been sexually assaulted or raped." Which study is this? http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail iid=593 the bureau of justice statistics says it's 1 in 40 and has significantly decreased and college men were more likely to be raped then women.
"This almost never happens. Intoxication would be someone who can no longer consent because they're very drunk/high, not just having a beer or two. Deception would be either pretending to be someone else in a dark room, lying about using contraception when you weren't, or the like." Wow a guy lying to a girl to have sex never happens are you this dense.  So if both persons are drunk or the guy is drunk is the female a rapist for having sex with him? lying about contraception? really?

"Anywhere from between 1 in 12 to 1 in 20 of the "average kid" will be a rapist someday, actually. And it's about creating an environment in which people are educated and aware and can help stop it. If you're a frat boy and one of your fraternity brothers says that there's a girl passed out in the other room with a wink-wink-nudge-nudge, you can say "whoa dude leave her alone that shit's not cool." Will it eliminate rape entirely? No, not at all. But it will reduce it - as we have SEEN." Seriously where are you getting these numbers from? i want actual sources.
Then what does that have to do with the rape culture which is usually in reference to america's college campuses.
Rape culture extends beyond the campuses.

It really doesn't it's in reference to the belief that their is a perceived boys will be boys attitude that obstructs rape victims from getting justice and that their is a pervasive system in place that does not support the victims of sexual assault. At-least that's what it was originally in reference to.  




 You're really trying to backtrack, this all falls down to the same claim that to the rate of which college age women will be raped, i believe it was 1 out of 5? i looked up the study and the only source for it went to a study from 1980's yet it's often repeated, even president obama cited it back in 2010. http://time.com/3633903/campus-rape-1-in-5-sexual-assault-setting-record-straight/ 

They based it on the same studies you're citing, honestly i'm not arguing with you i'm just waiting for you to actually stop repeating the same crap i always hear and present factual information. They all use the same anon self report census and the sample sizes if you can call them that are based on individual locales which are not representative of a nation wide epidemic or rape culture. But you can't say that, because it's not helpful when we still have politicians who actually believe a woman can "shut that shit down" so i agree with the scare mongers media campaign for the purpose of awareness but when we use this in a attempt to negatively effect or blame a society at large then it's more then a media buzz word it's an ethical issue. 

Define deception and intoxication? girl gets drunk, her friend says he loves her, next morning they wake up, he says i'm sorry Lindsay i just said i loved you so you would sleep with me. She feeling regret over the situation yells rape. In there you go, you see how that works out? in don't tell me you have never heard a sjw talk about regret being a valid reason to claim rape. 

Sorry let me define it in small words. Telling kids not to rape does not work because the average kid is not a rapist, telling a little girl the average boy will rape her is not factual yet it's being proposed as a viable method.

Then what does that have to do with the rape culture which is usually in reference to america's college campuses.  




 No offense but your post reeks of the same sectarian bullshit, alawites dehumanize sunni's blah blah what you forget is that if the sunni's were in power they would do the same if not worse to the alawites.  




 Better then yours when you claim something and then post a link that contradicts your own statement. Did you not even read that story? there is no other 68, that's the issue. There are not a hundred rapes reported, you just said in your last comment it was all theoretical. No what you're doing is trying to do is redefine rape, educating kids on rape does not correlate to actual rape because it's not in relation to sex or average population figures. Rape is about dominance and control, not sexual violence.

You can't find any numbers yet you just stated around 88 women went to jail for false accusations of rape. Do you just state things out of the blue? 




 Wow good on the uk. Now lets bring this to the rape culture of america. Um it stated clearly in the story if you bothered to read it which i guess you did not, that she was arrested and jailed for falsely reporting a robbery and for the robbery itself which is a huge miscarriage of justice but like i said shoddy police work. Now can you cite this 89 number? i would love to see to it and why america has not done it yet.

Rainn great org, http://time.com/30545/its-time-to-end-rape-culture-hysteria/ nice to see even they are tired of the rape hysteria. Yeah that's what i was waiting for the hyperbole line, you do know what theoretical means right? it has no practical application. In other-words your only 10% line is bullshit, you're claiming a stat which literally has no basis in reality. That's the height of bullshit claims.   

No wonder we can't actually fight rape when the advocates fighting for it are using such fanciful claims and misleading statistics. Rape culture= if you don't want to get raped, do not wear revealing clothing, such stupid logic. If we don't want men to rape, tell your boys not rape women. #facepalm

 




 "But we are allowed to prosecute them. People are prosecuted for false accusations. Not many, because the burden of proof is very, very high to avoid something like the Sara Reedy case."

Alright please link to me a case where someone was falsely accused of rape and the accuser went to jail.

"She was arrested and charged with falsely reporting a crime. This is a fact." I read the story, posted exactly what it actually stated and it said nothing of the sort. You said she was arrested for a false accusation, it clearly stated she was arrested for false reporting not an accusation. Am i insane or something? when did it say she was arrested for false accusation against a rapist??? it says clearly false reporting and robbery.  False reporting is a crime, false accusation which is the entire point i was making is not, are you ignoring this?

"We are basing these numbers on studies of our legal system. The most stringent analyses we have suggest that 2-8% of reports are false. The most recent, Lisak, came in at around 5% - right in the middle of that range. Coincidentally, that's roughly the same rate at which other types of crimes are falsely reported, too.
The 2-8% figure comes up time and again. Study after study.
Of course, even 5% means that with tens of thousands of reports per year, we'll get miscarriages of justice like Brian Banks. But a handful of high profile cases is in no way an epidemic."

So.... explain this to me like i'm 5. Where does the statistic only 10% of rapes are prosecuted? 




 Oh had no idea bruh, thought you were being a right asshole mate, my bad. Did not know i was asking for that, i didn't want people to make a build for me but this is my first time so i made a post over at buildapcforme tho since it seems simpler. Thanks for that, i thought this subreddit would be able to help guide me so i don't just randomly buy parts and other things. But i clicked on the sidebar and i'm going through it, once i have a better view of what i want to build and parts could i post a thread here with that defined build in get some tips to fine tune it? 




 **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

Gaming mainly strategy games like rome total war 2, shogun total war, mount and blade, but also hoping to play fallout 4, witcher 3 and chivalry. 

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

700 dollars is my maximum



**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 


Around july 14. 

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Tower, i was thinking of buying rebuilt and maybe just replacing parts but depending on the best build i will buy a tower case also. OS matters little unless it effects gaming, won't the best monitor i can find but not going to blow my budget on it, a decent monitor for a decent price even used will do. 
**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Illinois/united states.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

Starting from the bottom, no reused parts except if i find a really good cheap monitor on ebay or amazon.

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* Replace this text with answer.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

Depending on rather or not a game requires a large memory, cpu or w;e then parts relating to that will be paramount to my build. 

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Nope this is a basic pc build, but if it does not mess with my budget having a nice custom full tower would be a good finish for my first pc build. 

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

Windows 8.1

**Extra info or particulars:**

 




 Well like i said i'm new here, thought this would be a good place to get a helpful start and i prefer to actually talk to posters instead of going through sidebars and helpful guides, which is why i came to reddit, if i wanted the 1,2,3 of how to build a pc i would just gone to youtube.  




 Nope consoles also.  




 I am. The game is the only new ip that blew me away. The forums are blowing up.  




 In the case i cited under any definition, it was malicious yet it was still not prosecuted. How do you accidentally accuse the wrong man of rape? most rapes like murder are not due to strangers but close personal acquaintances. You're really reaching, of course, but they cannot be innocent until proven guilty if we are not allowed to even prosecute them.

"Following further inquiries, Reedy was arrested for theft and false reporting and, pregnant with her first child (by her now ex-husband), thrown in jail. She was subsequently released on bail, but lost her job. More than a year after attacking Reedy, the man struck again, but this time he was caught and confessed to the earlier crime." wtf i read the story and that's not how it went down at all. She was jailed by a idiot detective who did not believe her story of being forced to give head at gun point to a guy who robbed her gas station which by all accounts is kind of hard to believe at the outset, i mean what kind of idiot would put their penis in somebodies mouth they're threatening to kill. But yeah crap police work, she was not jailed for falsely accusing any man tho she was jailed because they thought she had stolen the money. 

Either-way your comparison falls flat because that was not a false accusation being prosecuted and then later being proven true. So only a quarter of rape's with actual evidence lead to actual arrest strange. So it takes actual evidence for people to go to jail? that seems like b.s and needs to be stopped right now. 

Tell that to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Banks_(American_football) unless you have facts to back up such statements we're going into hyperbole. How can you state only 10% of rape reports and then say they're not false, how do you know if they're false or not, if only 10% are being brought to court then maybe it's because only 10% are actually valid. What are we even basing these numbers on?
 




 Convicted. Look up the data for minorities convicted of crimes and giving harsher punishment and whites convicted for the same crime while receiving more lenient punishment.  




 Bro whites have a bigger population of course more whites end up getting shot, that's not the point, out of all those cases how many of them were unarmed and were they currently commiting any crime that justified the use of deadly force? did you see the homeless white guy who got shot in california or arizona? he got plenty of attention and the cops were charged with murder. Allot of this has to do with rather or not the shooting gains traction in national news, we can't be pissed if we have not heard about it.

That's not how it goes at all, just because black people are more likely to be involved or commit murder does not relate to instances where they were not committing a crime at all, if anything the fact that black people are being killed in instances where no crimes are committed is much rarer yet it seems to be occurring very frequently which is an alarming trend. 




 Wtf is up with you guys always trying to define everything as non racist. Nobody is claiming white people are hunting down black people but there are cops who happen to be white in the majority of cases shooting unarmed black civilians, pointing towards inner city crime statistics in saying oh look more black people killing black then cops killing black people obviously the problem is not that law enforcement is shooting unarmed civilians it's that black are killing eachother. It has nothing to do with what black people are concerned about or why we're mad, it's the equivalent to citing the rate at which jewish husbands murder their wives and then using it to excuse the holocaust. Just because a crime occurs that involves both groups of people does not mean they're related or have any significance in the other case. 




 In how many guns and drugs do they have exactly? 




 Wow black people being killed in high rates and the first thing i see is racist jumping in awesome. 




 Rachel dolezal for the last 37 years has pretended to be black, artificially darkening her skin, wearing black hairstyles(styles frequently worn or originating from African american communities or popularized by black people) she has also been investigated for false claims of ethnic/racial discrimination, filing police reports stating that her branch of NAACP(which she is the president of) had received hate mail, it was later found out by police investigators only two groups of  people have access to the mail box in question, the postal workers who were ruled out and the box owner who happens to be Rachel dolezal here's a video of a reporter who led the unmasking of miss dolezal, she had also attempted to apply for city jobs and positions citing her ethnic background as "black" and her parents have claimed she is claiming her younger adopted siblings who are African american are her biological children https://twitter.com/deray/status/609179032006041601
