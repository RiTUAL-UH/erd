 this^ 




 yes because you get out of the habit of thinking useless thoughts 




 My attempt is to try low stimulation activities, these include staring at a wall and doing nothing, walking while doing nothing or reading a book like nietzsche, our lives are full of overly stimulating activities like music, movies, games, porn the idea is to challenge the brain to live with normal to low stimulation, the brain should get "hungry" for stimulation and also your creative side will wake up even more. The mechanics for one activity goes:

Walk

 thought enters head

time is precious, is this thought even worth thinking about, this thought is probably a rationalization or weakness is it?

 next thought comes in "an urge to play a game", is there a good reason to play that game? no

 another thought "is this worth precious human seconds?" probably not

eventually the boredom will fuel the brain for neuroplasticity and creativity for self improvement

thoughts guys?

 An idea nietzsche put out there that clears this up. Many complex systems such as addiction as well as life can not be summed up into steps or rules we need to think for ourselves and deal with our problems as each situation is unique. This is why he despised the stoics while they said "just be perseverant" you can't sum up life to that one statement but I agree with everything else. 




 HELP I AM GETTING ADDICTED 




 I know how to sign in and when i Installed it i couldn't have logged in pre installation because it was new 




 tried both nothing...under links there is a bunch of folders with shortcuts gah i feel like i hate microsoft or dell now badly *sigh* :'( 









 I re-installed chrome and when chrome started it was like i had chrome for the first time and there were no bookmarks 




 apps are gone files are ok we can start a session if you can help with programs and apps 




 no list, everything all my web browsers with bookmarks all my games all my expensive designing suits  





























 i feel like super powers are gone after ejaculation though 









 Masturbating twice a day to nothing suddenly doesn't seem very stable and healthy, what if you trigger a sudden surge in hormones and chemicals and cause abnormalities, even cancer because of testoterone and prostate 



















 I relapsed yesterday i promised myself i would make it 90 days but it's like I became brainwashed it was day 5 and honestly in that moment I wanted to relapse the urge was so strong I wasn't myself anymore. Fucking hell :(

how?!!? 









 5 days 




 help 









 you guessed it i unzipped the bean bag  put my D inside and zipped it up so no 
beans will fall out and did my thing :( I feel like giving up on life damn

i honestly thought i would make it 90 days this time wtf *** my mind went animal crazy when thinking about the bean bag it was like it was sacred and no one thought about that method of fapping 




 When this question appears in your head what caused you 
"not to think of that"

neurologically
biologically
or evolutionarily 




 What causes me to feel like that and how can i prevent it 




 bump 









 EXACTLY
 




 Whenever i feel horny i get the urge to fap and my thoughts go straight to fapping instead of thoughts about sex and having sex how can i rewire my brain 









 I have been somewhat successful with no fap but as I used to fap before i go to sleep now when it's time to go to sleep non stop horny thoughts wash over my mind i feel all tingly and excited and it's like i'm brainwashed because it's a strong habit WTF do i do 




 Is it useful or harmful I sometimes sit there and say to myself "time is valuable, make sure you are thinking important thoughts"? so i sit in silence and then for every thought that comes into my mind i label it like i mentioned above reminding me of my precious seconds 




 or urethras  




 [SPOILERS IN THIS POST](/nsfw) 




 [text I want to hide](/nsfw) SPOILERS IN THIS POST 




 e.g. Planning to improve your life, signing up for cryonics, sequencing your genome, help fund life expectancy increasing science, taking actions to help yourself live longer 




 I realised i might have some OCD mixed in here, I relapsed again even after making a commitment

I watched a porn video yesterday that was a porn vid that I saw a few years ago when i was 13 and it was saved on a hard drive, I had a very strong OCD type urge today to find her and then re watch the vid so that "the penis can pound the hole hard" was what the obsessive compulsion it wasn't even a sexual desire but an obassessive compulsive one much like some earlier OCD symptoms in my childhood, , also "so that maximum pleasure can be reached for her" I also wanted to know a lot about her like her age and height,

 very strange :( I am failing badly and my life is falling apart 




 Emily Rudd 




 how did you find her 





























  e.g. gaming, distractions, perfumes, sexual saturation 




 B.S. Mining engineering, I am a mining engineer
gimmi gold! 




 e.g. regular screenings for general health and cancer 









 
You're now chatting with a random stranger. Say hi!

You both like philosophy.

You: Hello.

Stranger: hi

Stranger: ive noticed people with this philosophy tag type "hello" instead of hi

Stranger: and put a period after it

Stranger: aswell

You: Read Nietzsche?

Stranger: yes i know some

You: Such as?

Stranger: the will to power

You: Yeah i'm interested in ubermench

You: I wake up i try to improve my life, i still scratch my hair and skin, i still pop my joints, i still can't read a 

book and focus, i still get scared and anxious and confused, i still, fap and watch porn, i still eat junk, i still 

distract myself rather than think difficult thoughts, i am trying to re-wire these things but it looks like the 

downward spiral isn't changing course thus making it even harder to quit in the future neuroscience :(

Stranger: ok.

You: any thoughts?

Stranger: what does it mean to "improve your life"

Stranger: ?

You: move beyond your illusion

Stranger: theres your ego

You: self overcome

Stranger: you asked for my thoughts

You: well honestly are you pulling some zen buddism now?

Stranger: no

Stranger: i asked a simple question

Stranger: i dont see the relation

You: my answer is the paragraph above

Stranger: are you telling me you can not respond logically to a challenge?

You: you can deduce what it means to improve

Stranger: no i wont

Stranger: because you cant

Stranger: i have no interest

Stranger: because you are now below me

Stranger: and you have proven it

You: how so...

You: now you are being an elitist

Stranger: you want to express your bullshit delusional ideas but cant defend them with a logic structure

Stranger: no im not an elitist

Stranger: im sorry your ego is hurt

Stranger: it wasnt a complex question that went off on a tangent

Stranger: it was rather simple and challenged the base.

Stranger: the base should be strong

You: Self improvement is have control over one's self

Stranger: no it isnt

Stranger: that is your subjective interpretation of it

You: Training yourself to have conscious control when second nature insists otherwise

Stranger: so you are implying there is duality

You: No

Stranger: how can you not be in "conscious control"

Stranger: how could you know consciousness beyond your human consciousness

You: Just conflicting actions with desires

Stranger: are you implying that actions arent a product of desires/

Stranger: that duality exists between them

You: No

You: ...

Stranger: so then back it up

Stranger: use logic.

You: I'm using reasoning

You: and critical thinking

Stranger: no you arent.

Stranger: you arent challenging my points

You: Your points are not pertinent

Stranger: they are absolutely related

Stranger: everything ive been saying is a response to you

You: hmm

You: I did respond though

Stranger: i didnt say you didnt

You: I don't need to back up my "no"

Stranger: but you are by saying you dont need to back it up

Stranger: fool

Stranger: basic logic failure

Stranger: again.

Stranger: and again.

Stranger: my points remain uncontested

Stranger: you go off on more tangents now

You: No, you made claims without backing them up.

You: The burden of proof is on you.

Stranger: as in where

Stranger: bring it up

Stranger: where i did

Stranger: burden of proof is on me

Stranger: thats a baseless claim in itself

Stranger: rather than being your opinion

Stranger: but yea where did i make a claim without backing it up

You: You want your points contested.

You: Show me a point.

Stranger: we are having a discussion

Stranger: so you want to switch the topic now..

You: They are questions. In which I replied No.

Stranger: no you went off on a tangent

Stranger: i asked you to back up claims

Stranger: your base was "no"

Stranger: should i leave then?

Stranger: since you cant hold a conversation

You: What claim should I back up

You: You asked me if I was implying anything

You: and I said NO

Stranger: i did more than ask questions

Stranger: i think i added statements as well

Stranger: let me scroll

Stranger: "Self improvement is have control over one's self"

Stranger: that doesnt comply with the linear logic structure of language

Stranger: so back it up

Stranger: x=y

Stranger: is what you said

You: To achieve self improvement self control over one's self is a necessary skill.

Stranger: you just changed the point you made

You: i did

Stranger: so you couldnt back it up

Stranger: i assume

You: Not the first one

You: I re stated it

Stranger: sure i will challenge this one too

Stranger: saying something is "necessary" isnt true outside of your personal truths. "necessity" is an abstract 
subjective idea

You: Sure

You: It is of high importance subjectively

You: Saying that it is not is nihilism.

Stranger: "importance" is also a subjective abstract idea

Stranger: what?

Stranger: nihilism is a paradox...

Stranger: saying life is pointless is a point in itself

Stranger: as where believing life is meaningless is a given meaning in itself

Stranger: correct?

You: No

You: "as where believing life is meaningless is a given meaning in itself"

You: how is that a given meaning in itself?

Stranger: because it follows logic. "saying life is pointless is a point in itself"

Stranger: see the irony?

Stranger: meaning is an abstract subjective idea aswell. by saying it is meaningless

Stranger: you still use meaning

You: There is a regress there. Life is meaningless -- Created meaning --- Meaning that was created becomes 
meaningless. Followed by a halt in changing states as the threshold is exceeded.

Stranger: it is a paradox

Stranger: and meaning that was created becomes meaningless is meaning

Stranger: and it goes on and on

You: Intuitively ergo Life is meaningless.

Stranger: it doesnt mean it isnt it just means it also is meaning

Stranger: its

Stranger: a

Stranger: paradox

You: how old are you?

Stranger: why do you ask the question at this point in the conversation

Stranger: i hope this wont turn to an ad hominem

Stranger: but i mean you are going off on a tangent

You: Being overly analytical can be seen as a form of escapism, using what valuable time you have to escape 
solving real life solutions.

You: You limit your intuition to logic.

Stranger: believing that anyone can be "overly analytical" is a belief in itself

Stranger: so is everything you said

Stranger: there is a loophole in logic

Stranger: and so i challenge language

Stranger: but you hold absolutes with logic

Stranger: believing there is something to escape from is abelief aswell

You: Intuitively you seem trapped here. What's the reason for challenging the fabric here?

Stranger: i would say this pattern is more confrontational

Stranger: I seem trapped, yet you are the one going off on tangents and my last related point was uncontested 
again

You: so?

Stranger: you dont reach a dead end with this logic structure

Stranger: rather a circle

Stranger: that continues

Stranger: so you can argue forever

Stranger: and that is more confrontational than escapist

You: Living lifeoverly analytical

Stranger: i dont even agree with what i type but you dont have the intellect to point out my contradiction of self
You: As a function of time

Stranger: going off on a tangent again

Stranger: more ad hominems

You: How is it an AH?

Stranger: you just stated an opinion again while i maintaing objectivity in the logic structure of language

Stranger: because it is an opinion by logics standards

Stranger: and you are using that logic structure to communicate

You: ...

Stranger: we can take it more slowly for you.

Stranger: saying "living life is better than being overly analytical"

Stranger: is that an opinion?

Stranger: are the reasons for that belief based on opinions?

Stranger: is it subjective?

Stranger: answer those

Stranger: yes or no questions

You: It's based on intuition that is not limited by the constraints you keep on building.

Stranger: you are implying that i understand what you are trying to say

Stranger: thats an assumption in itself

Stranger: a belief.

Stranger: right?

You: Objectively and evolutionarily the individual is programmed to survive and reproduce, self improvement is 
intuitively superior to over analysis which is escapism in nature.

Stranger: no. that itself is a belief

Stranger: you are holding things to be absolute

Stranger: can you not see that what you are saying is subjective?

You: Your beliefs that beliefs are to be negated is an assumption in itself

Stranger: who said they are to be negated

You: now you are being paradoxical

You: you refute "beliefs"

Stranger: no

You: you haven't backed up why those are "absolutes"


Stranger: i just point out they are beliefs

Stranger: i just said there arent absolutes

Stranger: ..

You: "you are holding things to be absolute"

Stranger: o

Stranger: why do you hold them to be absolute

Stranger: was the question

Stranger: ok

You: I don't what makes you think I do?

Stranger: because by making a statement, you hold it to be definitive by its nature

Stranger: by the logic structure that you participate in called language

Stranger: every statement is a paradox

Stranger: even saying every statement is a paradox is a paradox

Stranger: meaning, if i say nothing is absolute. i am holding "nothing is absolute" as absolute

Stranger: so it doesnt reach a dead end with this logic structure

Stranger: it just loops

You: ok

You: What is the over arching concept here

Stranger: ok

Stranger: how could i communicate it with language.

Stranger: after what i just said

You: Intuition

Stranger: intuition is a product of this logic

You: How?

Stranger: because it is an idea that can be formulated into words

Stranger: its paradoxical

You: how is it a posteriori?

Stranger: im going to use an idea that can be formulated into words to express an idea that cant be formulated 

into words

Stranger: thats what i cant do

Stranger: but i can

Stranger: because i just said it

Stranger: thats why its paradoxical

Stranger: agree? disagree?

Stranger: "thoughts"

You: indifeference

You: indifference

Stranger: if you were indifferent then you wouldnt need to say you were indifferent

Stranger: see how it loops?

You: I'm indifferent about your statement I care about stating it though.

Stranger: right



Stranger: so you arent indifferent

You: I'm indifferent about your statement I care about stating it 

though.



Stranger: after all that you still cant use the intellect



You: What?



Stranger: you defending what you initially said is just as paradoxical



Stranger: and you cant see that


Stranger: or dont want too

Stranger: w/e

You: You are the one that can't use intellect.

Stranger has disconnected.
 




 "I, test_subject2183, accept the challenge of being accountable for the next 90 days to this group of Fapstronauts. I will make it the full 90 days without viewing pornographic materials, faping, edging, or having any form of sexual intercourse with my wife. I am committing to this because I love my wife more than anyone in the world, and I MUST change for her! When I prove to myself that I can endure this 90 day struggle, I will have the ability to stand strong for the rest of my life."
(You can set your own rules for these next 90 days, and briefly summarize why YOU need to change.)
We will kick off this 90 Day Group Accountability on Sunday, November 24th. Anyone who would like to jump on board with us must have this post submitted no later than Saturday the 23rd, so forward this link to all of your friends, and get the word out! I will link "Day one's" thread 




 I wake up i try to improve my life, i still scratch my hair and skin, i still pop my joints, i still can't read a book and focus, i still get scared and anxious and confused, i still, fap and watch porn, i still eat junk, i still distract myself rather than think difficult thoughts, i am trying to re-wire these things but it looks like the downward spiral isn't changing course thus making it even harder to quit in the future
neuroscience :( 









 i'm in, should we make it on facebook chat perhaps, like a grop convo there 




 Evolutionarily the teenage years are when hormones spike and psychological activity alters, this encourages organisms to leave the family and go out to seek mates, with the internet and pmo we have overstimulated this trait to the point of dulling pleasure receptors the key is to focus on self improvement and avoid pmo 




 Longest streak is 8 days 




 Develop a cycle when you get energy from being horny, use that energy to do things that help you with no fap and thus get more energy. 




 If we cut back from such pleasures, less pleasure chemicals related to such tasks would be involved, less chemicals means more receptors which means improved quality of life? 




 What happens after long term withdrawal of superstimuli?

http://www.highexistence.com/supernatural-stimuli-comic 




 If we suddenly cut back on all superstimuli, over time what kind of people will we become? Will we be better in general?
e.g. I am choosing to read a book over watching a tv show, reading a book will help strengthen my attention span, and isn't overloaded with sounds, visuals and fast paced action, so it's more calm and contemplative 









 I relapsed 20 times in the span of a few months with a longest streak of 8 days without orgasming 




 tight makes it harder as well because i feel like my penis is restricted, if it goes to full size like 8 inches it feels like it's being held back possibly affecting angle and growth 




 I want some practical advice here
 




 help
 




 Constant stimulation as the glans rub against clothes makes it impossible with relapse after relapse, about 20 relapses when trying no fap over months of trying it's just impossible to be successful at no pmo and fantasy

fucks sake 




 doesn't tag nsfw
not a signle fuck was given 




 yeah man, after many relapses i learned that being successful at no fap isn't the goal but rather self improvement, it's an overall challenge to make your life better 




 bump 




 When i say "amazing" many would just read the word but the type of "amazing" i am talking about is beyond anything you can imagine right now [AMAZING](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1pb5n3/why_i_do_no_fap/) 




 Help, I was alone and i had a fantasy of a friend that is a girl do some foreplay and soem fucking and i am feeling really horny and my imagination feels real if i try hard enough, i held onto my penis and moved the skin around it wasn't really masturbating, i came close to orgasm though and i felt tempted to orgasm but i'm wondering should i just orgasm now or should i continut with the streak, and how dangerous is what i did today to rebooting 









 also in a philosophical sense, if everything is beautiful you can't contrast the negative so the beautiful can't exist as there is nothing to manifest it 




 
Exercise.
Save money.
Plan for your future. Invest in it.
Wrap your tool.
Tell everyone how you feel about them because in your future they will all be dead.
Relax.
Be positive. Choose to be happy.
Surround yourself with positive, caring people that are better than you.
Practice forgiveness and understanding.
Set goals and put your entire being towards them, whatever they may be.
Give everything you do in life 100%, regardless of how you feel about it. Success is a choice you make every day; it is not dependent upon results.
You're not always right. Always assume you could be wrong. If you are, forgive yourself and move on. Don't dwell. Be thankful to those who corrected you. Ego and pride are roadblocks, surpass them.
Your entire life is defined more by what you give to others than what you have or receive, whether you want to admit it or not. Every day practice a habit of giving, even if it's something small like a compliment. You always have something to offer others, even if you don't have time or money.
Remember that you, just like everyone else, have the power to change the world profoundly. You matter. You only have one life. Make it count. 




 Comfort over challenge, watching tv, tasty food, escapism etc. 




 When a person transitions from: insecure, fearful, sensitive, critical
to: "alright attack me", adrenaline type energy, wanting to face fear, wanting to feel the pain, careless/carefree, is it a type of nihilism? or is it more of a ubermench eixstential attitude 




 Yeah something about quitting cold turkey after masturbating for years doesn't seem right, maybe one should just gradually cut back 



















 Circumcision via the dorsal slit method when i was younger is making me depressed every time i think about it, also the rubbing of the glans during walking or exercise is irritating and especially during exercise I worry that it's desensitising even more. I also worry that I am missing out on so much like the pleasure of having a frenar band and the foreskin with benefits like smoothness and warmth
