 What was it? 




 Are there any particularly fun/unique experiences you've had with your dog? 









 There was speculation among anti-captivity circles that this application had much greater implications for the import of wild-caught cetaceans to the U.S.  Had it been approved, some believed that it could open the door for the capture of Alaskan killer whales that ventured into Russian waters, which would be of great interest to SeaWorld in particular, as the genetic variation within their captive population is deplorably low. 









 Are these rubber-tipped sticks?  If they're not and the guy has decent chops he could probably do some damage to the treadmill. 




 Here are the links to the papers on [blue whales](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1765/20130657) and [beaked whales](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/9/4/20130223), respectively, sited by the article.

I'm surprised the authors of the beaked whale paper were able to get published with a sample size of two individuals, but since beaked whales are so rare, it was probably not feasible to use a larger sample size. 









 Congrats on the long term relationship! 

I've never met anyone from Ohio that is happy to be from here.  Either they already left and are glad they did or are planning to leave after whatever life milestone comes next (graduation, retirement, etc.).  The only problem is that it's like a miniature black hole of terrible that's nearly impossible to escape from. 




 I'm surprised Ohio hasn't shown up yet.  Do non-Ohioans not hate our state as much as we do?

We don't even have a real flag, we use bodies of water as directions (north is called "towards the lake" and south is called "towards the river"), and our unit for measuring time is "days until the next Ohio State University football game."  Oh yeah, and soybeans.  Soybeans.  Everywhere. 




 I was an idiot today and was playing with a power strip with a wet hand while the other was in an aquarium and I was standing in a pool of water.  I felt a buzz in my finger when I turned on the strip that I hadn't felt before when using it and realized I'd just been shocked.  That freaked me out because I could have potentially died and not even realized it. 




 I wrote the previous comment at work and guessed on the date.  In his 1867 book *Mimicry, and Other Protective Resemblances Among Animals* (and later, his 1879 paper published in *Science*), Alfred Russel Wallace suggested stripes evolved in order to provide camouflage from predators by allowing zebras to blend in with the surrounding area.
This particular hypothesis was refuted by Darwin and others since the stripes do not blend with the usual zebra habitat of short grasses, but the more recent adaptation is that the stripes confuse predators by making it difficult to single out an individual in the group.  However, zebras tend to live in small groups or are solitary, so this might not even be the case.

Some other hypotheses are that the stripes are for social benefits (sexual selection or communication), thermoregulation, and protection from parasites (tsetse flies in particular).  Darwin thought it might be for intrasexual selection and described an experiment in which a female zebra and a male wild ass are placed together and the female zebra would only let the wild ass mate with her when the researchers painted stripes him.

Personally, I think zebra stripes are least likely to be for predator avoidance, but that seems to be the one that has stuck in society's list of animal myths.
