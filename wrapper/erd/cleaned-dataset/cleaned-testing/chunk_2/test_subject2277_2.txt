 From the story, OPS is the 3rd most understaffed in the entire country.

Those 130 accommodated cops don't help. 




 No.

You must reside in Ontario. 




 From the story;

10% of the OPS is on light duties;

"That senior officer told CFRA there are **130 officers** who cannot do their regular tasks because of things like injury or pregnancy.

"That's 10 per cent of all our sworn staff," the senior officer told CFRA. "That's huge."

I'm told morale is horrible in the OPS, undoubtedly 10% of a force getting out of regular jobs doesn't help.

 The fact that this even went to trial is a travesty.

The police and the Crown clearly have too much time on their hands.

This man's life is in shambles. 




 Go to the bank in person, see a teller and you'll be able to withdraw some cash. 




 Free speech isn't free if we self censor out of fear of violent reprisal. 




 There are no laws governing abortion in Canada...where I live.

Medical guidelines yes, laws no. 




 People cheering on those who would make Death threats in response to provocative and robust speech should hold their heads in shame.

 




 A fetus alone in the womb will become a baby.

Semen alone will **never** become a baby. 




 Semen needs to fertilize an egg.

Semen can never become a human on its own.

I've honestly never heard someone comparing semen to a fetus before.


I'm pro-choice, but your analogy isn't convincing. 




 I'm prochoice, but the **rare** late term abortions where the baby **would** survive outside the womb, I find quite distressing

Im perfectly happy with them and I have a VoIP phone with them as well. 




 TIL factual recounting of real events constitutes an attack. 




 Won't make a difference to any claim. 




 I'm happy to see that the police investigated themselves, prosecuted him internally under the PSA, convicted him and then fired him, which was upheld by the OCPC. ( Remember these cases when Canadians claim cops can't investigate themselves)

There **should** be a mechanism in place to suspend officers without pay on a case by case basis.

No such mechanism exists, so dirty and corrupt cops get their top base salary of 90K while they work their way through the system.

So, the government needs to legislate this power, that is currently unavailable to police Chiefs.

The Ontario Association of Chiefs want the ability to suspend with pay on a case by case basis.
