 But if you look into it to this extent, twisting facts to warp the show to your worldview, at no benefit to the story, it's utterly pointless, a waste of your time and a waste of mine. 




 Because of course DISGUISING herself as a male character, despite the fact she still used a female bathroom is conclusive, fullproof evidence. 




 Nui uses Female bathrooms, has a female voice, wears a dress, has been depicted nude, has breasts, has a favourite colour of pink, describes herself as female... I could go on. What does the series gain from this twist? Absolutely nothing, there's no male NUI subtext, there's no context, it would just piss people off. Face facts, you theory just doesn't work. You can write a fanfiction about it, but it will never, **ever** be canon. 




 So, since I don't have any Kill la kill episodes to wait all week for, I've decided to develop a comprehensive schedule for myself for life after Kill la kill


Monday: Madoka Magicka: Looks like a pretty sweet little magical girl series, should be fun!


Tuesday:Attack on Titan: Continues action and mild apocalyptic/fantasy flavor of kill la kill, also highly critically acclaimed


Wednesday: Claymore: The first anime I ever watched, so I'm watching it again. Continues action girl, dark elements of kill la kill


Thursday: Bakenmonogatari: Highly acclaimed, anime I'm personally interested in


Friday: gurren lagaan: A nice anime to round out my Friday, nice to get some hype for my weekend


Saturday: Space Dandy: Basically my saturday night comedy


Sunday: Sakura trick: Heard good things. I also want to create maximum contrast with madoka mondays


Basically, I want to watch acclaimed anime every day, but from every end of the spectrum, from light to dark, any comments/advice? 




 We need more deep, detailed roleplay, with developed characters like this in the yogscast. I mean, you guys just keep upping you game, first SOI, the Yogsquest, and now Zachs reddit links to erotica. I think this your peak, your magnum opus. 




 I think it should mainly be role playing games, since Yogscast is, in my opinion, about role play. 




 BUT THEY NEVER IMPLIED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE! There's literally no evidence for it, it's not a theory, it's fanfiction, that's not a bad thing, but  there is not a single thing in dialogue or imagery to indicate Nui being male other than Nui not being overly sexualized (and NUI's distaff counterpart, Mako, wasn't either, and we know she's not a boy). **Even if** it was a twist for the OVA or word of God, everyone would say it's bullshit, because there has been no foreshadowing. 




 Yep, immediately after the last episode, people were declaring the ship dead. However, people started to reinterpret and analyze, and suddenly, it was back afloat, and now the community is going to shit. 




 The series is over, if she was a boy, they would have said, or at least giving some direct implication. 




 I think the OVA will be plot pivotal. 
*If Rei lives through that OVA, we will get a series 2
*If rei dies, we will not get a season 2 **with these characters**
*If rei dies, and their are no more story breadcrumbs/loose ends, it's over, and we should look forward to triggers next anime.
 




 We don't know if that was the 'date' in question though. The ED obviously took place quite a while after the finale, whereas the 'date' was implied to be a more spur of the moment, immediate thing. 




 Because for both sides there's *just* enough evidence to make you think it's open and shut. 




 Is't it weird how everyone thought the gamako was sunk after the episode and now everyone's saying the Ryumako is sunk? 




 Apparently it is actually a translation error or the word 'Deito.' In my opinion, that makes a lot of the final scenes a lot less dramatic, but oh well. 




 OK, that makes much more sense, as that's a translation error, however, I would still say that still doesn't CONFIRM or disprove any ships, as we have no idea when the ending ED is set. (presumably, in my opinion, the 'date' isn't shown in the epilogue, as it's obviously set way after the ending, whereas the dialogue implied that the 'date' would be a more immediate, spontaneous thing)  The ending will still ultimately, be ambiguous, and I actually think that's a bit gutless, but oh well. 




 I'm not serious, if you notice the alliteration, I was comparing that Hypothetical to the equally unlikely hypothetical of 'It's just a friendship kiss guys!' Hence why I think that Neither was definitely confirmed, because you can trade tit for tat shipping comments all day long. 




 I'm a massive gamer, from dwarf fortress to Okami, what sort of games are you thinking? TF2? 




 Early credits is Ryuko's imagined, perfect past when she was being mind controlled by Ragyo and had her memories changed. The second ED is her actual life after the events of the season, hence why it has a happier, sweeter atmosphere. 




 She'll die in the OVA. 




 I'm not disregarding evidence, I'm just saying that saying 'Mako kissing Ryuko was just Mako being Mako' is just the same as saying 'Gamgoori was just gonna give flowers to Satsuki, who he has been trying to protect for years now' I just don't understand why you assume that GamagooriXMako was confirmed when there's no real concrete evidence for it. 




 But we **Don't** know he was going to ask her out, we also only know he was fond of her, but no direct romantic interest. 




 There's no concrete evidence for the Gamagoori thing either, if you can say that Mako openly kissing Ryuko was platonic, you can also say that Gamagoori was trying to present flowers to Satsuki, or that if he had tried to ask Mako out, she would have refused. 




 So I was wondering if the use of the word 'date' has the same connotations in Japan as it does elsewhere, as I think it would be helpful to know if it had an odd translation in the sub, or some hidden cultural meaning or whatever.

Basically, I would like discuss, from a purely rational perspective, whether the ending actually confirms ANYTHING about the shipping war stuff, or at least stop people from assuming that the term 'date' was used in a platonic sense from the get-go.

 




 Mako has shown no romantic feeling for Gamagoori, and there's the fact that the Mako is the only person capable of cooling down ryuko from brainwashing, and Ryuko keeps talking in anticipation of the date in the finale... and there's the kissing stuff, and the nosebleeds in earlier episodes, and the fact there is no canon confirmation of Gamagoori's LOVE for mako.

I don't think still supporting the Makogoori ship is unjustified, but saying it's the only canon ship is ludicrous,and there was no need to make that derogatory comment, I'm simply saying that if characters specifically talking about a DATE, they might be talking about, y'know, a date.

Im simply arguing from a state of rationality, I'm not shipping anyone, I'm simply stating that I think there's more evidence for the Mako Ryuko stuff than to the contrary, but neither has ultimately being exclusively confirmed. 




 Depends what rei does in the OVA IMO, if she gets defeated, no season 2. 




 I think it will be half and half. If rei doesn't turn up, it's essentially a given there'll be a season 2. Remember, Rei said in ep 22 that her life wasn't important as long as the life fibres achieve domination. 




 But there isn't an indication that the ED shows the 'date' anyway. I'm sorry, but the terminology would not be used if it was platonic. 




 Exactly! Mako, in a friendly way, handstitched M's onto Ryuko ass! It's the only logical explanation! 




 I think Rei will feature heavily in the OVA. She's a massive loose end. Perhaps the OVA may be exclusively about her. 




 Those are Friendship M's! Friendly M's! 




 Doubtful. Disney does develop adult properties through paramount anyway. What will likely happen is greater synergy of TV and maker studios content. 




 Guessing the reason she was cultivated, alone with some of Ragyo and Nui's backstory, will be given in the last episode. 




 Neir, a fairly obscure JRPG, had a secret ending when you got 100% To get there, you had to essentially complete this 50 hour game 4 times. However, the ending is heartbreaking, and you have to choose whether to sacrifice your character to save the world. If you choose to THE GAME DELETES EVERY SAVE FILE IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE. Hundreds of hours, and all that remains is a lotus flower on the title screen. 




 It's the perfect size for a run.  In Britain, the most successful shows manage to achieve that over. **4 years** Besides, you get a whole new series from trigger every year anyway, and 24 is just enough to leave you satisfied but appreciating the conclusion. 




 I actually made a speculation post for her a week or two ago, and I'm happy with her character usage. She saved Nui and Ragyo from death, and she probably has some backstory coming next episode. It seems to me that she was a sacrificial lamb bred to power up Ragyo, and she was grown specifically to fill the roles nui and Ragyo couldn't. 




 Not dead actually, powering up Ragyo 




 That, in my opinion, is an example of the kind of elitism that puts people off anime. Anime is just programming, it has good and bad elements too. Those people who you see as watching 'reality TV' may actually be watching breaking bad or some other great show, but you misbrand it as something you hate whilst they brand anime as the 'naughty tentacles.' You can't expect people to culturally accept your media when you don't accept theirs. 




 I'm a primary wiiu gamer, and hate programming, but I love DF 




 I doubt the series will go into space, if they do follow up on that plotline, it almost certainly won't be with the same characters as this series. Remember, Kill la kill's world has shown no evidence of advanced space travel, Even the nudist beach ship, which is the result of Billions of dollars and insane amounts of intelligence, is still a regular boat with a rocket sword mode.  




 Who's ranium? 









 Hooray! One episode closer to dwarf fortress (hopefully) 




 I personally doubt the nui one. She's the combination of some guys sperm and a hive mind race bent on killing everyone in the universe to propagate itself. She's also a deliberate pragmatist, and would have killed ryuko multiple times without intervention. She doesn't give a damn about relationships. 




 I would definitely say it's a longer game, but the fact you can just brute force it, and get different results each day, means that they'll definitely be able to complete it. 




 I think Rei may be involved in a twist involving this, that, or she dies horribly next episode.  




 But, if you don't reload and get tot he end each time, you essentially get a new narrative whilst looking for the spell lines anyway. There are also multiple ways to get each one. 














 Called it. 




 That Great scientist wasn't capture by Barbarians, he actually retreated to a cave to discover the secrets of time travel. 




 Try Moon Knight or Rorschach from Watchmen. Moon Knight is Batman but with Split personality disorder and less badassness(which makes it even more badass when he does something cool)and Rorschach is batman if hew was poor, and had a REALLY shitty life. 




 And South park is nowhere near the animation quality of kill la kill anyway. 




 Animating costs time and money, if you don't animate things, you save money to be used animating action and fight scenes. 




 I'm in a similar boat, personally, I'll be watching FLCL,Bakenmonogatari, space dandy an Gurren Lampa. 




 I personally think that level of complexity is unlikely. As far as we're aware, individual life fibers aren't sentient, and  it would be odd to pull the 'ryuko is evil' twist again. I think that, other than some Rei backstory, all the cards are pretty much on the table now. 




 The animation does seriously decline in quality, but that's due to them saving all the budget for the last two episodes, which are one long fight sequence. For example, the eating scene in ep 22 was just static pictures to save time and money animating characters eating. 




 I don't personally watch it, mainly because I like city building games to have enemies and combat after playing DF, but that's just me. 




 Nui and ragyo are only evil, and satsuki was never chaotic or neutral  




 Fair point, but the sword not being used from the start isn't the optimum example of that, it's just a cool way to end a fight rather than something endemic of the films writing. 




 The winterkewl channel has the update videos. Because the stuff initially shown was a 'vertical slice' it's taken a while to get up to the quality seen in those demos. 




 Nui has deep psychological issues, she doesn't need the mind control. However, an interesting question is whether Rei, a completely normal person other than being completely happy to destroy the world is being mind controlled. 




 Because she's a badass, in her initial appearance she came in and blew every other character out of the water. I don't want her to win, but I'd much rather her or Rei as the final fight than Ragyo. 




 You like her, just as an antagonist you love to hate. Bear in mind most people thought that Satsuki was a villain, and hated all her fascist bullshit. We were expecting The elite four to come in, Ryuko to grow in power slowly, and eventually take down Satsuki and Ragyo. Nui came in and just didn't give a FUCK. She was a major subversion of standard shounen tropes, and incredibly pragmatic compared to Satsuki? Was I rooting for her against Ryuko? No. Was I rooting for her against Satsuki, taking on all her resolve and order with just her skills? Hell yes. 




 Hey! That's my favourite episode! 




 Parv of Crybabylon 




 Now, I don't usually get involved in shipping of any kind, but Kill la Kill has really fascinated with the potentiality for the the climax to literally go anywhere with character relationships. Similarly, reading up about KLK, it's been very interesting to see how the fanbase have incorporated plot developments into the growing speculation on what ships, if any, will happen by the end of the series. The points of contention seem to be around two fairly recent plot developments:

1. The Mako Gamagoori hinted romance/ship, I don't think a lot of people saw this coming. Usually, ships are speculation based, particularly the Yuri or unlikely ships, however, the Mako/Ryuko ship seemed increasingly likely, with frequent references (such as the nosebleed) however, after aorund episode 12, suddenly this changed, and the fanbase latched on to the Gamagoori/ Mako ship, particularly as Ryuko started to lose some audience sympathy at this point. I think it's very interesting that Mako has two potential love interests yet they're both equally 'unorthodox' (it would be a gutsy move to make the protagonist a lesbian, but also a gutsy move to deny how it thematically makes sense, as well as the shipping and fanservice angle that is played up fairly heavily on the show.)

2. The sinking of the Satsuki/Ryuko ship. Although some people still struggle along with the incest angle, It's almost certain nothing will come of this. Which leaves us with a problem: If Mako goes with Gamogoori, Ryuko really wouldn't have any love interest that she's significantly invested in, furthermore Satsuki is now almost certainly not going to have a love interest of any kind.

Therefore, I ask a question to you fellow redditors, what, from a story perspective, is most likely to happen in terms of these relationships? Will Trigger go for the gutsy move of a lesbian main character, or will they choose to pair up only Mako and maybe a few elite four/ nudist beach members? Or maybe nobody at all? I welcome the discussion. 




 Because she simply looks young, I mean, it may be presumptuous but how else can we tell the characters age? Also, don't life fibers naturally control people over 20, and although she's Ragyo's lacky, she definitely seems to be capable of independent thought. 




 Nui has been shown to be working on a project away from Ragyo's vision, looks like we've got the mother of all double crosses on our hands. 




 This has been speculated upon, but personally I doubt it, If Isshin was in disguise, he would have blown it when everybody were pulling the aces from their sleeves. Furthermore, even if he was in disguise, Ragyo must have hired a random girl, who only existed six months ago, to be her assistant, then told her all her super top secret plans, all with no prerogative. It may happen, but I think it would be bad writing if they don't give a VERY complicated explanation. 




 But why would you get a at most 18 year old girl to do that? Why would you tell her all your plans in detail, including the details of Covers? Moreover, why wouldn't you get her to be absorbed into covers when her work is done? 




 OK, So I just finished a marathon run of the Anime this weekend, and I'm super excited for the next few episodes, but I think one character is being potentially overlooked,Rei Hououmaru, Ragyo's assistant. I believe she will have some vital importance to the climax due to a few key factors.


1. She's the **very young** assistant of the main antagonist of the series, an antagonist that's shown to be extremely take no prisoners, psychopathic and condescending. The only other person in Ragyo's triad is Nui, one of the most powerful characters on the show, why would she have an assistant with no special abilities or no master plan in mind?
2. Rei is shown constantly in shots, including the titles sequence, she was also not unimportant enough to be offered to the covers, she must be kept alive for something
3. If you had a final trump card like Ragyo surely does, you wouldn't want to hide it in a secret base that could get hacked, or use it so openly in combat like with Nui, you would hide it in plain sight, slightly blurred and out of focus, just like Rei. Therefore, I posit a theory: The new outfit being made by Nui isn't for Ryuko or Ragyo, it's for Rei, the person under her absolute control and power, kept following around on a leash. I predict Rei will do something in the climax that openly makes us go WHAT THE FUCK? Like so many of the twists so far.


Anyway, I'm open for discussion and contradiction, so fire away! 




 I like to think that Duncan acquired those resources through a daring, oceans 11 style heist. 




 Wait a second, luck is useless in combat, it's essentially a junk skill. What a crappy thing to sell. 




 Really? Will it turn me into a snake? 




 Wait, where was the ARG about 'eyebrow guy?' That sounds hilarious. 




 OK, I believe this was a fuck-up. A HUGE fuck-up, but a fuck-up none the less. 




 But that just dug you a bigger hole. If people were criticizing you for deleting posts, why did you ever think deleting those posts would help? 




 So the post that was deleted minutes ago, which was simply a twitter post by Rythian, was deleted by bots for the words 'oh snap'? 




 This isn't absolute power, this is enough power to delete comments you don't like without any discussion or debate, this is just enough power to make it you're always looking after the public interest. 




 Give a couple assholes the ability to whitewash their problems away and this tends to happen. I remember a similar situation killing the mighty no9 forums. 




 Coming soon: Minecraft: the subreddit chronicle. 




 Please for the next indie game play Abobo's big adventure! It has actual creative talent put into it! 




 Nope, even if you actively try to make it less complex, it will still have things like military upkeep, inventorary management, hospitals, minecarts, dwarven personalities, tantrum spirals and vampires to contend with. 




 I've suggested this in the game suggestion thread, If he's already played Earthbound I really want him to play mother 3. It would be amazing to see a game that actually makes sips cry. 




 You know what would be really Meta to play?South part:TSOT. Think about how much roleplay we would be doing! 




 Nobody expects the Spanish sjinquisition! 




 mmm, I do think that's a problem, although there are now mods that let you use Towns style sprites for DF. I just think the RP potential is too good to ignore. 




 Hey sips, this may be COMPLETELY out of leftfield, but how about Earthbound? It's generally seen as one of the best JRPG'S ever made, is all about American values, is nostalgic because it was around in your childhood, and is quietly weird without being in your face like South park. (Although Earthbound was inspiration for the new South park game) If you've already played Earthbound, I'll suggest something even MORE radical [Mother 3](http://mother3.fobby.net/), the sequel to Earthbound, which was made in 2006, and, thanks to the glories of fan translation, can now be played in the west. Mother 3 is generally regarded as a narrative masterpiece, humourous yet incredibly touching. (many people have said it made them cry) I know it's a big undertaking, but I gaurantee you'll be hooked by the end of the first chapter of Mother 3 




 IMO rather than do Towns he should just bite the bullet of town development games and try dwarf fortress, It's more complex than towns will ever be
 




 Ok, So i just put this up on the actual subreddit (derp) but [Abobo's big adventure](http://abobosbigadventure.com/) would be the perfect game for sips, It's all about the big bastard from double dragon himself,is super fun and has loads of awesome references and easter eggs! 




 Can't believe this has never been suggested before, but the boss that sips was excited about in Double Dragon neon, Abobo, has had his very own videogame for a couple years now! I don't want to spoil to much, but it's the PERFECT game for sips, and in general is a send-up to the NES games of his childhood. The game can be found [here] (http://abobosbigadventure.com/) 




 Anyone else think that Lewis's voice was exactly like Ed Millibands in this video? 




 The yogscast: Masters of minecraft. 




 There's literally no point to metagaming in a choose your own adventure like this. I've played it, and there aren't any instant lose conditions, you just travel the journey you want, whilst stopping off to get the keywords on the way. 




 But you redo the entire game whenever you reach the gate without the keywords. 




 They don't really get how this works do they?  It's like a kid going:
"I can make much betterer videoes than pewdiepie, he got 10 million subs in a few years, I'll get like ten bajillion in a few seconds with my 360 no-scopes!" 




 I like to think of it like this, if helix is God, and the Dome is the devil, Zapdos is Cthulhu, a being TPP was not meant to have, that is slowly driving us to madness, anarchy isn't working, democracy isn't working. All fall under the mighty zapdos.  




 I'm not sure he'll be able to survive this massacre much longer. The keeper  needs to be put back in the box, only then will the madness end. 




 WHEN WILL THE MADNESS END? YOU DAMN MANIACS!WHEN WILL YOU LEARN? 




 Bigdig digged to heaven :c 




 Nah I'm sure... OH GOD, OH GOD BIGDIG NO!!!!!! 




 So this is how Bird Jesus ends, with thunderous applause.... 




 You thought Zapdos being caught and saved from release was a good thing? You thought the helix, in all his power and wisdom, would directly intervene to save the supposed '2nd coming'? Face it, if Flareon was the heretic, Zapdos is the antichrist. He killed Dux, he Killed the seed, he isn't even a follower of Democracy,he is bigger; a bigger force of evil at play than even the Dome. 




 There's only one word that accurately describes my feelings right now:

lol
