 Mirror, Mirror and Snow White and the Huntsman 




 It is a bit underrated movie although i think it deserves much more than that.I liked the movie very much.Brad Pitt,Casey Affleck did a great job.The directing was very good too.The concept of narrating the story was great. 




 After watching Part-1 my ideas on crime movies were never the same again.And no other crime movie can compete with it either.
