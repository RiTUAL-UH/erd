  Wise Man's Fear so quickly almost broke him, and it isn't quite as as polished.

There were also a couple of pretty blatant author's mistakes that he might've otherwise caught ... 




  For the millionth freaking time, the search function is terrible because nobody titles their post to reflect what it is.

Yeah, which is why the search function should be able to *search comments*, which would be hugely useful.  Not to mention being able to search by userid, or even just search my own comment history. 




 How is that relevant to this? 




 Or developing a better search function. 




  Spent like 10 consecutive hours watching the most god-forsaken movies.

The touch screen on the seat in front of you, on a tube of aluminum travelling 600mph at 30,000 feet to Africa, didn't have a great movie selection.

Truly we live in horrible times. 




  I don't want to pay for somebody else's health 

If you have private health insurance, that's exactly what you're doing.  I'm not sure if you get this, but a lot of other people honestly think that their premiums only go towards their own care. 




 Significantly less than 100% actually had the means to do so. 




 You're drunk early. 




 Also I haven't really decided what part of Cali to visit either.

You know California is[ rather large](http://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/m6mos/california_in_perspective_for_east_coasters_usa/)?  Because you're going to want to narrow it down. 




 Is this more of a suburban and/or East-coast thing?

Because I live in a place where the snow   rain would seem to demand it (well, most years), but no one does.  While a lot of people have hardwood or laminate floors, even people with carpet don't bother. 




  i would think even a WW2 era U-boat could sneak up on many modern ships under electric power.

Doubtful - subs make a lot more noise than just from their energy source.  Just the prop or shaft noise from a U-boat could no doubt be heard by any halfway decent modern warship from miles away. 




 Because it sure doesn't read that way in the books, but the Pandora station I've got set up is bland to the point of falling asleep.  Thin, reedy, pluck-ish ... lute music seems to lack depth and passion.  

It's the kind of music I can see being played in the background of a dinner in Georgian London, with everyone talking severely and quietly and otherwise being staid and boring. 




 HMS *Invincible*, which wasn't. 




 Depending on where you live, you might want to try the Home Energy Assistance Program.  I'm headed that way myself in the next few days, for the same reason (48hr. notice).

 The full length "Watchmen" trailer with the Smashing Pumpkins music.

That, or the first time seeing the "Independence Day" trailer, which I believe was during the Super Bowl in '96. 




  The Dad jeans don't hug the legs at all, they give no sense of shape, make a fit guy look less fit

And they're a whole lot easier to do physical labor in, which is the point for some of us. 




 I'm pointing out that there seem to be enough exceptions to the rule, so as to make your title untrue. 




 McKiernan:  Hey, I totally want to write a sequel to Lord of the Rings.

Tolkien Estate:  No, you can't do that.

McKiernan: (*Does it anyways.*) 




 Rothfuss claims he hasn't read the WoT. 




 It isn't on the old clock I have, or on any clock that uses Roman numerals that I've ever seen. 




 We've been living a lie, my friends. 




  Now it owes it's independence to France. Did they also fight all the battles an declare independence too?

You really need to read up on the Revolutionary War - the nascent U.S. was heavily supported by French money, and a lot of French troops and naval forces.  There were almost as many French troops at Yorktown as American, and it was the French fleet that fought the British fleet in the Battle of Chesapeake Bay to force the British surrender at Yorktown. 




 And it's not like they have a whole lot to spare ... 




  The family wasn't struggling 

And now you know why. 




 Your post has 64 words and zero facts.

That's a pretty impressive ratio - I couldn't even do that on purpose. 




  I had 3 colonoscopes performed by the age of 23

Yeah ... you weren't really there to check for cancer, were you? 




 "Cloud aiming" or "pixel aiming" was a quick way to get banned from some servers, though.  It was real obvious when you were doing it. 




 Huh, that's the same code as the lock on my luggage. 




 Nothing in particular, but damned if I wouldn't at this point. 




 Anything involving physical pain.  Pretty much that. 




 Everything in my life.

Sorry, I meant EVERYTHING FUCKING THING in my life.

From being so broke I'm soon to be evicted, to the fact that I haven't so much as touched a girl in nearly six years and I'm still in my 30s, to that fact that I can't get a job and I don't know why even when plenty of people are willing to speak up for and recommend me, to the fact that fuck this.  Just fuck this. 




  Dems will bankroll candidates the exact same way as the Koch brothers and spend just as much money doing so.

Again, [citation needed].

Scale matters.  The Koch brothers throwing nearly a billion into an election cycle, or Sheldon Adelson cutting $10 million checks to Newt Gingrich, is slightly different from Soros tossing a million or two to a progressive PAC every now and then.

Hell, Texas oil billionaires probably spent more money on Swiftboating Kerry in 2004 than Soros has spent on Democrats *ever*. 




 Yep, that was the one.  If it was about 2001-2003, I probably killed you a few times, or got killed by you. 




  I fell out the back of that AC-130 a few too many times though (when the pilot decided to climb fast).

It's a good thing literally everyone in the game was magically carrying a parachute, then. 




 I'm noticing a complete and utter lack of hard numbers, or even soft numbers. 




 Does the id "21st_Panzer" ring any bells?  That was our clan name.  We played all day, every day, or at least we did on weekends, and then we moved on to BF2.  Our preference was for the WOLF servers, which are apparently still running. 




 I've read two of them - *Night of Knives* was decent, because it was minimal.  It didn't try to be epic, it just told an interesting background story in a sparse, action-laden fashion.  *Return of the Crimson Guard* tried way too hard to be epic, and failed.  

ICE has a tendency towards bad prose, and just throwing a bunch of things into the story without really blending them.  He covers all the plot elements required, but not smoothly. Very choppy, jumps-around type of work.  And he frequently underwhelms with his revelations of big mysteries.  Something will get hugely built up, and then when you find out the secret, it's like ... "That's it?  Seriously?" 




 Get elected President first, and we will.

One of the perks of the job. 




 [citation needed] 




 Unfortunately, it's ICE that's going to be writing the prequels about Dancer and Kellanvad. 




 One of my best gaming moments was shooting down a MiG-29 with the howitzer on an AC-130, while it was passing by in the opposite direction, in a BF1942 mod called "Desert Combat."  

The other guy was both pissed and admiring at the same time. 




 "The Pentagon Wars" is satire, designed to make the anti-Bradley bureaucrats look silly.  Too many people don't get this, and think it's the generals that look like fools. 




 It would've been useful as a target, not much else - it was poorly designed, and the Germans had *zero* carrier experience.  They would've had to learn on the fly in a shooting war against a vastly superior navy. 




 Seeing my bank account balance. 




 Such a huge part of my childhood, and in a picture format that I remember from and associate with that time.  Thanks. 




 Like the X-29, but less polite. 




  Makes it sound like a different planet.

Well, that's not entirely inaccurate. 




 Lots and lots of snow, like there should be this time of year. 




 @JesusNazareth: They said I was hung, and they was right. 




 I didn't know her name, just respected her for her ability to escape from a bear trap. 




 I've never eaten macaroni and cheese that didn't have a shape. 




 A bit touchy about being called out on being completely wrong, now aren't you?  I directly quoted how wrong you are. 




 You said, direct quote: "Republicans got more votes."

They empirically didn't. 




 You have very poor reading comprehension.  I'm pointing out that, contrary to recent Republican claims, capturing a simple majority in Congress does not mean that the party that does so represents the will of a majority of the country.

Also, you might want to drag yourself out of 1983, because currently a majority of Americans favor gay marriage.

 I can buy whiskey, porn, and guns at the same store.

 There was a much larger population of girls that wouldn't sleep with me in college. 




 Get drunk, masturbate, weep bitterly. 




 I spent a couple summers working at a marina, and let me tell you ... the girls that vacationed there were not in the least bit modest. 




  Oh, so you're saying Democrats lost because Republicans got more votes.

Actually, they didn't.

http://www.vox.com/2015/1/3/7482635/senate-small-states/in/5654656

"the 46 Democratic caucus members in the 114th Congress received a total of 67.8 million votes in winning their seats, while the 54 Republican caucus members received 47.1 million votes."

But you just keep on telling everyone how the current Congress represents the will of the people, and has some kind of mandate. 




  Gerrymandering by race is against the law

Oh, well, gosh, guess that means it doesn't happen.  It's *against the law*, after all. 




 Were any of them from an Axis country? 




 Or even at least once. 




  India? Sure you can have nukes! We'll even sell you the stuff you need..

India has had nukes for nearly 50 years, without US help. 




 Believing things that are at direct odds with provable physical reality is pretty much guaranteed to cause you problems in an academic setting. 




 I can only imagine what would happen if Anomander Rake showed up in the Wheel of Time universe.

So.  Much.  Pain.

 A lot more.  Oh, God, so many more, it's such a pain to clean them all up. 




 Subject to change. 




 In the late Sixties, Milton Bradley created the game Battleship, which introduced the catch phrase You sank my battleship to the general public.

It is still the shortest and most accurate history of the battleship to date.

Perfect. 




  I actually think that its the Maer.

The Maer Alveron is very likely King at the time of the framing in Newerre - the King's soldiers are wearing Alveron's colors (white and blue), and it's doubtful that there's been enough time for him to have sired an heir, and that heir to have grown up and taken the throne. 




 In the category of *very* minor characters, I still think Geoffrey completely scammed Denna.  Maybe Devi's in on it and gets a cut, I don't know. 




 No, I'm saying that doesn't particularly make them any better or worse than many other countries of equal strength and regional involvement.

But some people talk like they're the next coming of Nazi Germany, which is a really stupid, counterproductive mindset. 




 Remember that guy who called Iran a member of the "Axis of Evil"?  He spent eight years representing the entire Republican Party. 




  Poor Iran, such a bullied victim.

Feel free to name all the countries that Iran's invaded in its modern existence.

Hint:  None. 




 These are the only two pictures I could dig up - I've sold a bunch more, but have a bad habit of not taking pictures of them when I do.  If I can get some customers to send me photos, I'll add them to the album.

I tend to focus on more rural, casual scenes.  Very reasonable prices, especially right now. 









  He's just too far back in the peerage for it to ever happen. 

While this is possibly true, that peerage is getting thinned out.

And I thinks it's a bit of foreshadowing that the birds Kvothe chose to get killed by Caudicus' poison have the same name as the royal line of Vintas. 




 Noted and done. 




 Plumas. 




 In fact, my very patient landlord waited way past 60 days, I'm more like 90 behind, and he finally sent the 30-day notice.  Currently unemployed and worked a cash job over the summer/fall, so no UI. I've scraped up one month's rent ($350), but live in a rural area where there's just no day-work, almost no social services (I have no kids, so don't qualify for any county or state - California - help), and very very few jobs available.  If I had anything valuable to sell, I would, but I never really have.

The usual work I do in the winter is dependent upon getting snow, and we (rural NE California), well, *haven't*.  I'm not looking to raise $1000 from redditors, but literally anything would help at this point.

So I'm just sort of tossing this out there with a little more than a week left.  I just wish I was a cat who needed surgery or something - I'm not a huge sob story, just financially desperate over a bad winter.

EDIT:  PM me for Paypal details. 




  in Skarpi's story, Lanre and the Creation War, it's said that the "the enemy was set beyond the doors of stone".

Felurian says the same thing, which to my mind is a bit more credible. 




 Because they don't get along with the 51st state. 




  Sorry if this is a dead subject.

It has been for about 150 years. 




 I think Clancy went a little crazy after Clinton got elected. 




 Probably because it's a technical field demanding highly trained workers. 




 Look, we take our bacon seriously.

And we don't mean that Canadian shit either. 




 If Ticonderogas were ice cream, they'd taste like Praline and dick. 




 Woohoo!

I'm still four months behind on rent, but I have Gold, so I can at least be entertained in the meantime before eviction.

Which, completely and utterly honestly, is nice.  Like the song says, it's the simple things that make me smile. 




 No, it isn't.  It's never my fucking lucky day. 




  Chlorine Triflouride

That must be Patrick Rothfuss' inspiration for bone-tar. 




 That's like complaining about the visitor's lockers not having hot water for the showers - in the '80s, you should have just expected it as routine fuckery. 




 My birthday is July 21st - all that neat, new information coming back from Pluto is going to make a nice early present. 




 Not behind that line, you don't. 




 I prefer to believe this. 




 The *Kentucky* chipping in, to be precise.  They should've brought *USS* *Camden* in just to complete the picture. 




  But for whatever reason, that shitty pre-sliced bread is really popular in the US. 

You know ... that stuff is really, really good for a couple of things.  First:  well-buttered toast.  Generic American sliced white bread just makes really good toast.  Because I don't want an overly-strong flavor like sourdough or whatever first thing in the morning.

And second, grilled-cheese sandwiches, with the equally-derided Kraft American cheese slices on them.  Two over-priced, over-processed piles of chemicals that only vaguely resemble their namesakes, but when you put them together are so goddamn delicious.

EDIT:  I'll toss in a third thing:  Cheap grade-school sandwiches with lots of mayo.  Namely, ham-and-cheese using cheap, tangy, fatty mayo and mass-produced deli sliced ham.  Or with Oscar Meyer bologna, which probably isn't even a real meat, but with enough mayo and mustard on Wonderbread is really, really tasty. 




  My girlfriend and I live in Sacramento where the water is pretty good.

I lived in Davis for quite a while - the water is far worse than Sacramento.  The water towers look neat, but what comes out of them is awful. 




 Nice of them to specify ice glaciers, so we don't get them confused with some other kind. 




 Source?  Because I'm currently living in a 90%+ white county (Plumas), that's not on the map.  In fact, there's at least one other (Sierra) just in California that aren't listed. 




 I'm especially talking about things with complex recipes, where the store-bought version has a long shelf-life but the home-made version has to be used fairly fast.

In my case, it's Caeser dressing - started doing so a week ago, and I'll never go back to the bottled stuff, though there are plenty of decent brands out there.  I still haven't done ranch because of the short fridge-life of buttermilk, but that's probably up next. 




 Woohoo!  Four months behind on rent, this is just the ticket to get out of a bad situation!  And not get evicted in a few weeks. 




 I believe those are called "Hot House" cucumbers here, usually from Mexico. 




  I have not heard of any place in the US that you can't drink the water.

You've clearly never been to the California Central Valley - it won't kill, it'll just make you swear off water.  Like drinking from a pool. 




 5. American bread is sooo sweet. The crust is also really weird. It's not crispy. It's soft. Like not crust, but still crust.

That's common, mass-produced, generic store-bought sliced bread.  Any decent grocery store will also have a bakery making *much* better stuff.

 The "MLK / Lee" Day on the front page of /r/pics is turning into a Lost Cause-athon for the Confederacy, in case no one noticed, or didn't feel like staying sober anyways.

For preparedness reasons?  Because California != L.A. 90% of the state doesn't resemble L.A. even remotely.

  Washing slowly destroys clothes.

Yeah, but not nearly as fast as *not* washing them. 




 So what's a good stream for those of us with bad connections?  Because every post seems focused on the streams with the highest bandwidth and resolution.  If I could afford that kind of connection ... I wouldn't need a stream.
