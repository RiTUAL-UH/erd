 I see a redditor. How many days til someone leaves and how many people leave? 




 Oh you mean that girl over there showing half her ass? Yeah she's just with friends 




 My cat's name is Miles davis cuz I love jazz 









 what.... I almost don't believe that 




 Just because he doesn't remember the conversation doesn't mean it didnt happen. We need answers man! 




 Blond hair 




 Oh right ok. At the moment I'm nervous about a lot of stuff ha 




 What year in med school are you? I'm hopefully going to pharmacy school next year. Just waitin on that email to come 




 I just hate how throughout the series we're led to believe that the whole gang is always together. Uncle barney and Aunt Robin are always prevalent. But no turns out they all pretty much go their separate ways.

Barney's part too. He just becomes a total loser at the end. Perfect month? I'm sorry but no. And then he has a kid with a random ho whom we know nothing about and everything is fine and dandy. Why have we never heard about this kid before. Wouldn't that kid be Ted's kid's friend? Total shortcut in writing 




 I thought the way it was written was classic himym, definitely not the top 5 worst episodes 




 Anything autism related. I don't even know why that gets discussed on Reddit 




 You may need to explain this further 









 Since when is all of france the size of NYC? 




 That's how I got here. I remember back in 8th grade I had a Coach Z shirt. So awesome 




 I have an actual cat, is that cool? Anyone? 




 That's true but at least Barney doesn't introduce the girls to them. I mean I don't break up with someone then show off the latest person I'm seeing to my ex 




 Ok, thank you for actually coming up with a reason. Of course I wouldn't discriminate against other races. I don't think there's a country in the world where every single person is unattractive  




 Are you trying to make me sad? 




 /r/subredditsarehashbrowns 




 I don't get your logic why is it necessary to be attracted to every single Asian group? I mean if you think Italian girls are hot does that mean you have to love Polish girls too just because they're all European? 




 My parents are putting me through college and I thank them all the time. I mean it literally wouldn't be possible otherwise. Working full time at the same time as college wouldn't be enough, and that would be darn near impossible anyways 




 As a college student I can say there's a direct correlation between time spent studying and grades on tests. However I don't really get hw I just have to memorize tons of stuff 




 How is thinking chinese girls are cute racist? And no one asked you to reply to my post 




 Salmobrolas cousin 




 I think it's stupid in most cases. Like at a bar when they pour a beer and hand it to me. I mean really what effort didd that take?

Now for a barber I'm all for it cuz they could totally ruin your life. 




 Peppermint Schnapps. No bueno for drinking games 




 Mandarin and Spanish for usefulness.

Russian and German for fun 




 3. 2 white girls and a chinese girl. I'm 22 now and a guy. I'm white but I seem to be really attracted to Chinese girls for some reason  




 Nyan cat 




 Sports. Skipping class to go on a bus ride for cross country was the best 




 Good thing I'm lipid soluble 




 "Look is this gonna happen or what?" 









 The last episode just really made me bitter towards Robin. I feel like she was the reason the divorce happened. Sounded like she only cared about her career and never spent time with Barney 




 I asked this too awhile back. General consensus was that was just Barney joking 




 And now you're into human sandwhiches 20 years later? 




 Very center of my College's football field. I'll never watch a game the same way now.. 




 Ahh yes, the 500 point turn 




 [Delicious new GIFV format](http://imgur.com/AEUVRrG) 




 I always wanted Ted or Barney (either one really) to marry Wendy the Waitress. She's one of the best looking girls on the show and looks fun. Maybe I just want to marry her :( 




 This may sound weird but I've always thought smoking in old movies or like this picture looked cool. I don't smoke but damn OP's dad just makes it look awesome. Just that relaxed look 




 Hello Dr. Fielder, What is the flu season going to look like this year in response to the Ebola craze right now?  Will people be overly diagnosed?  




 Half of them are of hot girls

Pic I took from the top looking down as he described. Very terrifying!  




 I thought the name of the dog was the best part 




 I toook History of Jazz. Also awesome 




 And is now stalking OP  




 Did she have to be naked for this? 




 I had this as a kid. So amazing 




 $15 of.... in store credit 




 If you think about it most of the crime in those places isn't even reported in the news. So more than likely they're worse 




 You gotta love crab 




 Well I'm glad someone did 




 It's pronounced thermometer 




 Yes in fact these 2 motions are analogous to said fingerbanging 




 Did anything cool happen or did you just mail them back? 




 I can just hear those ribs cracking 




 Chucks/vansheels. always 




 My cross country team was an absolute joke. We did far worse stuff than wave, like skipping across the finish line. It was fun though 




 Yep, had this happen to me once. The dude came to my car, opened my door, and yelled at me.  To OP, that is a horrible situation and I hope the guy gets thrown in jail for a good long while 




 Chad's bad 




 I definitely agree. Although I did love Archer Vice. Glad it's goin back to the original format tho 




 I thought it went well. They were pretty casual and only asked about 5 or so questions that were all what I'm sure any pre-pharm person would have answers to.  Then they let me ask questions; I had a notebook of them written down so I just asked away. And they were all super nice 




 Did everyone back then just have thick black hair with perfect hairlines? 




 MC Escher that's actuallly a genius title for this. I'm still confused.. 




 Plus the timeline seems all screwed up. I watched Death Note in like 36 hours and I couldn't believe the plot of the sho was over the span of like 6 years 




 All mine was accurate except math. It went from 73 to like a 63. I was not happy 




 Thanks for the advice everyone. If anyone else has questions about the interview process I could probably answer them after today 




 This dude I work with said he only ate ramen for a whole month. He said he didn't go to the bathroom once the whole time and by the end his gums were bleeding. He's pretty sure he got scurvy 




 This gave me call of duty war flashbacks 




 Pirate skulls were so 1600's 




 Then get rid of the parking ticket I got 




 My collar is baby blue not purple you jerks 




 Drinking coffee now

Straight black cuz creams for bitches

And teas for snitches 




 But microbio  bio 









 Why can't he write it? 




 This would be awesome framed 




 I can't believe I even finished Face/Off 




 It's been awhile since a good Reddit safe heist.

*prepares popcorn* 




 I need that song in my life. Anyone? 




 Why does KISS look the way they do yet sound the way they do? 




 Seriously, I've asked a few questions that have gotten like 20 replies with only a couple upvotes. Only to be buried with the rest of them 




 For some they actually paid attention and learned a thing or two and enjoyed going to class 




 Watch all the cartoons my parents wouldn't let me watch. All those missed Pokemon episodes.. 














 Don't worry you'll be caught up on everything that's happened in the last years within a week or two 




 That is terrifying. I think it's the eyes. And the antlers obviously 




 I love how the buildings are so huge but scattered about enough to not just see one gigantic block 




 I'm in a college town and my friend has met up with a lot of girls from it. Some are cool, some aren't, either way an easy way to meet up though 




 I feel the same way about North Face. At this point tons of people wear the jackets just for fashion, yet NF still makes the jackets for their intended purpose 




 This is an ideology I can get behind 




 From what I heard he also sold thousands of dollars of diamonds though 




 Yes. 




 I'll have the matzoball soup 









 How could I change my channel? 




 I'd love to wear a button up and tie on occasion. I feel like I'd look weird though 




 Sorry you have had bad professors. 

I myself am a Senior here at WSU and have mostly taken classes in the Bio/chem departments. I have to say with the exception of my Engl 101 TA every professor I've had has been great. They are all experts in their fields, have been very good with explanations and keeping the class interested, and all their tests have been fair in accordance with the syllabus. Even the difficult classes I wouldn't complain about because they just require more studying.

If you are thinking of coming here, please do.  This is an awesome college with great programs (especially engineering).  Go Cougs! 




 Funny you should mention that. I just failed my first Immunology exam, and I too would agree it's been my hardest class to date 




 Rough wasn't it? Feels great to take that last chemistry class though 




 Could be high school, college, grad school etc. 




 I live where it gets sub freezing for the whole winter. Got one of those 3 in 1 Northface ski jackets and it's one of my best investments. Totally worth it if you plan on using one for years 









 How are there 2 of these comments with the exact same replies with different upvotes?? What is this sorcery? 




 It's awesome but looks so out of place 




 Have 5 infants grow up in a room with nothing but 5 instruments, have them learn the instruments but with no outside music knowledge, and see what they play
