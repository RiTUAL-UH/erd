 Yes, there are hardly any IDE interface ssd's and at that, it does not utilize the full speed of an ssd. You will have to buy another sata3 cable. 




 Just search on google for windows 8.1 ISO. You can download it straight from the Microsoft website and load the ISO file into bootcamp. This is good until January. 




 Windows 8.1 is free right now. 




 As an AT T customer, i get a constant 20mbps down speed on my uverse line. Also with wireless, i enjoy having the ability to use data while talking on the phone simultaneously. Something other carriers can not provide. (try to call somebody and then go to google if you are on verizon and make sure your wifi is off).  I live almost right under an at t tower and get 35-40mbps lte data :).

 You can say all you want but it is inconsiderate of people around you that have to get up and go to work in the morning with less than 5 hours of sleep. The mother and the person that used ignorant words like "fuck and hell" in his story length paragraph is unacceptable. If you have a child with mental disabilities, you should think about people around you. 




 It's called boot camp. And you get windows 8.1 for free until January.

 The pentium being a dual core, yes it would put a good limit on the 760s capabilities. I would go with at least a 3220 (it's a dual core with hyperthreading) if you are on a tight budget.
