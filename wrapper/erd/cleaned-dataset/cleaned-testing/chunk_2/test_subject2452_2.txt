 holy fuck! Wait, what's hexadecimal? Is that a math thing? Anyway, thanks for looking that stuff up because I was having a hard time deciphering it. What weirds me out is why would the hacker/author change the name from satan to the one that sleeps below and when did he do it? I've made a few grammatical edits already so he must have managed to slip it in at some point. but yeah, if he/she's trying to freak me out, there's no reason to change it because I get the idea and I've been freaking out this whole fucking time. You mentioned the confusion of tongues, maybe he's having trouble finding the right words? Fuck, I don't know enough about this stuff. also I don't mean to burden you but do you think you could decipher my name? Every time I type it (and I'm assuming this time will be the same) it comes out as [666f756e6420796f75] 




 and that was my name. I tried editing it and writing it a few different ways but it always comes out as a different combination than any other name I write. This is messed up. 




 Okay, I was just testing it, any time I  try to write a name I get the same thing...[666f756e6420796f75] 




 [61206c6f737420736f756c] [61206c6f737420736f756c] [61206c6f737420736f756c] [61206c6f737420736f756c] [61206c6f737420736f756c] 




 What the hell! I'm pegging this on a hacked account. Maybe it's a weird ad-bot thing that's replacing my text on submitting it? I don't really get why the text is so weird though. If anybody has some feedback, please post in the comments. I'll be doing some research on my end as well.
