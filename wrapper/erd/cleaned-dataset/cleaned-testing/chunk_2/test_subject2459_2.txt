 I know a lot of people like that, me not so much I don't spend that much time on them. 




 Oh that's too bad, a pretty young age to start, you should ask your doctor about ways to quit. 




 I think a lot of people have that :) 




 Me too :) 




 That's not so great, maybe you should talk to her about it or get some kind of help. If you don't she might leave you and you'll regret it. Hope everything turns out ok. 




 I love gaming, I don't really exercise but I game a lot!!  




 That's not so bad, I love music too :) 




 Ha, ha okaaaay. 




 Not drugs or alcohol etc 




 Yeah, I mean you don't have to do it for ***everything*** I know I don't but it helps with quite a lot. It actually wasn't my idea, I saw it on another post and used it from there :) 




 I've always wondered about this, if it is Earth where are other planets and/or stars. Why is only Earth visible? 




 No, I think you're thinking about call of duty. Halo doesn't get all those 13 year olds spamming the chat. 




 Oh my god!! That's awesome as a huge halo fan that ring makes me want to kill someone for it but that's great for both of them. 




 Hey welcome to nofap. You're in a good position that you have college to keep you occupied and a girlfriend who you have sex with. Anyway it won't be easy but good luck, here are some [tips](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2vrsoe/wow_times_flown_by_nine_day_report_and_some_tips/)
 




 No, the guy in the picture is from an episode of south park and he says:

"... your gonna have a bad time" 

Throughout the whole episode. So I made it for south park fans. 




 Okaydokay 




 Thanks :D 




 Okay, the guy in the picture is only in one episode and he constantly says your gonna have a bad time. 




 Thanks for all the tips, 15 here, never been addicted to PMO but wanted to quit cause I don't like what it does to people in the long run.

Here are some tips to help you through, good luck!! :) 




 No matter what don't have an affair. Either leave yiur wife if you're un happy or stay with her and her alone. 




 Cbc? (Conspiracy?!!) 




 True. Do you like south park? 




 Okay. 




 I'm 15, almost 16, hang in there. Just think if you do it right you can lead a virtually porn free life!! :D here are some tips I poste  yesterday, hopefully they'll help.

 Ha, ha I'm sorry but that's funny. I saw the post that inspired this sub, I highly doubt we would all lose the ability to sneeze. 




 I think it would just be another forgotten website. 




 So it's some kind of joke?  




 Sure...

* Less anxiety

* more do less talk

* more motivated

* less procrastination

* Better view of women

* more confidence

* better self image

* control of your body

* deeper voice

* more time

* less embarrassment

* not having to worry about clearing search history

* and tons more! :D 




 I mean I get /r/nofap (I'm a part of it) but why /r/nosneeze? 




 I love it on christmas day when I look around at my family, just for a few seconds, and I look at their huge smiles.  




 Dying light. It has really fun co op with friends and a huge map you'll likely have way more fun on that than on evolve.

 Hey welcome to /r/nofap!! Good luck I hope this sub helps you out I leave a link to some tips I posted yesterday that might help you out.

Good luck!! :D 




 Good luck! We can both make it there!! :D 




 Me too :) good luck!! 




 Good luck! 




 I'm at ten days too! :D great job and good luck. I'm having all these benefits too. I'm more of an indoor/gamer type person but I'm going out more, seeing friends that I normally only see at school and the dreams have been great, a lot more vivid but of course Istill play a ton of xbox :) 




 Happy single awareness day!! :D

Good luck :) 




 Nice picture (I like how you added the fapstronaught :) ) 




 That's not what anyone here thinks. We decide not to fap for a ton of reasons:

* More time

* Better sex (actually able to finish unlike a lot of people who watch porn)

* more energetic

* more confidence

* better outlook on life

* in control of our bodies

* and a million more!

Research this sub before you talk crap about it! 




 Great job so far! So close! :D 




 Sorry, what? 




 Wow great job making the ring! And congratulations on your engagement I hope you two have a great wedding, a wonderful honeymoon and a fantastic life together :) 




 Nah don't reset I mean that's different when you're awake it's different but it was still just a dream. 




 Hey I'm 15 so I don't think it makes it mored difficult. In fact we're lucky because we can actually live a porn free life, good luck! :) 




 Ha, ha :) 




 Ha, ha :)


"By this point she'd been dead longer than I knew her"

I guess him and Mona got kinda close. 




 Ha, ha Randy is great I loved it in season 18 when he was Lorde :D 




 Do you mean in ways of an affair? If you do, don't it's wrong. If you mean you want to move on then just go out meet people, ask friends to set you up, try online dating. 




 Final fantasy has some great love stories. 




 I know right! I love it, what's your favourite episode? 









 I know right! :) 




 I hate uncharted, more of a TR guy but I get why people like it :) 




 Nice choice, I loved them together :) 









 I liked it, it was exciting... I just realised how sad I am. 




 I know!! :D 




 I'm 15 so I really don't want to... yet. 




 Were I was attacked by Freddy Krueger. You all know the movie right? Well I've watched it a million times and it's still never scared me (lets be honest who has it scarred?) and to be honest this dream was awesome!

So I was in the dream and he was in my kitchen, I grabbed a knife and tried to stab him, knowing it wouldn't work, I ran outside with him still chasing me. I met a girl I knew and he had been tormenting her too so I gave her the knife and said:

"Hurt yourself! Cut your arm, feet something!"

She said 

"Why?!"

And I replied

"If you can hurt yourself in the dream you'll wake up but just don't make it something that can kill you!"

So she did and all of a sudden she vanished so I picked up the knife and tried to hurt myself, Freddy still getting closer, but it wouldn't work no matter what I tried, the knife was like plastic now. Eventually he caught up and started suffocating me while laughing. I managed to get him off and ran for the hills. I don't remember much else but it was amazing!! (Because you know I love movies and the first nightmare and elm street is one i have a soft spot for). 




 I made it to get /r/freedonuts for the simpsons tapped out and then I realised there were a billion and one other things to do here so I decided that I would check it out and use it, now I love it! :)

My username is xbog4mer because I'm a gamer that plays xbox also I like the number 4. 




 I'm 15 but I turn 16 next month :) 




 Ha, ha nice question.

Searching amazon for masquerade masks and ball gowns.

Their porn would be a woman undoing her hundred button boots

Searching for the nearest carriage number.

Checking how much it costs to travel to the new world :) 




 Ha, ha thanks :) 




 Nah, I prefer xbox but you can't deny how awesome they'd be. Sure they copied her, then she copied them but still it would be nice. 




 Oh by the way I'm a HUGE xbox fanboy and prefer Lara but I hope everyone can appreciate how cool they'd be together. 




 That's why I want to stop, it's not a problem so this has been relatively easy for me but I want to stop before it becomes a problem.

I wrote that earlier, there's some tips if you want them. I love dragon age. Bioware are great I can't wait for ME4 




 A slug! Or a snail! 




 Yeah I feel great and yeah gaming I'm doing it now while I'm talking to you :) How's your nofap going? 




 No but it brings you closer to orgasm which is basically setting yourself up to fail. 




 Yeah. If I don't thay stay in my trousers and it's kinda painful. 




 Bill Gates 




 If you want. I wasn't addicted or anytbing either but I decided to try it and it's going great! You seem like you have it under control so if you don't want to that's cool but it will only work if you really want to stop. 




 Awesome, I love playing classical, romantic and modern (I like everything really but they're my favourites). 




 Good luck to you! :D 




 Thank you, good luck! :D 




 No cause then I wouldn't have learned from it but I think this sort of stuff should be taught in schools so that people don't fall into it. 




 Thanks for that :) 




 Ah well, you're taking it very well it's her loss. Keep going man

Anyway good luck to you! :D 




 Thanks! I've never been addicted or anything but it was making me lazy and I was thinking things like all women fake orgasms. I know that's not true but when I do have sex it'll be with a girl I care about (at least 3-5 years from now, I don't want to have it too young). It will be much better than fapping. Anyway good luck to you :) 




 That's great! What's your favourite song to play? 




 This shouldn't be in /r/gaming it should be in /r/gambling 




 Do the small things. Volunteer for a charity. Donate old things. Give a homeless person a nice hot drink and a sandwich. 




 Don't give up you can do it! Here I wrote a report an  some hints earlier, hopefully they'll help...

http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2vrsoe/wow_times_flown_by_nine_day_report_and_some_tips/

Good luck!
 




 I know most people do these on their tenth day but hell I'm in a great mood.

I've been studying more, playing less xbox but still enough for fun and of course I don't waste time fapping. I'm only 15 so obviously I'm a virgin which made me think:

"I don't know if I want to quit cause I won't have sex for years"

But it's worth it. It feels like I stopped yesterday and sure I've had alot of urges but this is fun and I'm already seeing some benefits!

Good luck to all of you out there. I'll leave some tips for those of you that feel like you can't make it.

* Say "YES" or "NO" to everything. Am I going to fap? NO! Am I going to study now instead of procrastinating? YES use this and it really helps.

* Use the 10-10-10 rule. If you fap now how will you feel in 10 minutes? In 10 hours? And if you quit nofap how will you feel in 10 years?

* A lot of men on here say they have trouble "finishing" during sex because of how much they've fapped, I'm only 15, like I said, but I don't want that to happen when I do have sex. Do you?

* Think of the fact that porn is just filmed prostitution. No one wanted to be a porn star as a kid. 

* If you want you can meditate, I do and it helps.

* I'm religious so that's a motivation for me.

* Think of the regret you'll feel later.

* don't try and stop urges just acknowledge them and then say ah well now I'm going to go and... (do something else, basically acknowledge it and move on)

Good luck guys/girls!! :D
 




 So true but many people in porn actually enjoy it I remember a few pornstars doing AMA's a while back. Of course most of the time what you said is the truth. 




 I'm 15, porn got me when I was 11/12. I was never addicted but I have a few ways to stop fapping when I think about it.

1. Think that porn is just filmed prostitution and that it is wrong 

2. Break questions down into yes or no. Should I fap, no. Should I do my homework now, yes. Should I...

3. Think about all the guys on here that say they can't cum when they have sex due to PMO. How horrible it would it be if you lose your virginity (if you haven't yet, I haven't and I don't want to for a few more years yet) and you can't "finish". 

4. Think about the 10-10-10 rule (yes I got that from another post). How will you feel in 10 minutes if you fap now? How will you feel in 10 hours? And how will you feel in 10 years if you quit nofap now?

Good luck :) oh and try not to thibk about porn or sex so much, I never really have but who knows everyone is different. When porn/fapping/sex comes to mind acknowledge it and then send it away and think about something else. (Meditation helps too, I've been doing it for a bit now and it's really nice). 




 I know right, hopefully this will stop at least one relapse. 




 No don't reset it but learn from it and try not to do it again, good luck. 




 ...Filmed prostitution. Would you have sex with a prostitute? Would you watch someone else? That's all porn really is. It's disgusting (even if it doesn't seem like it when you watch). Think of this if you consider relapsing, you're about to be part of the reason that there is a demand for "filmed prostitution". Instead don't be, even if you, yes you, alone don't take part in it then you will know that. It might not make a difference, it won't make porn go away but at least you won't be part of the problem. 




 I'm 15, I started when I was 11/12. I've never been addicted but I just don't want to be a part of filmed prostitution, cause that's all porn is. 




 Okaaay  




 Ha, ha mine too (next to milk, not together... obviously) 




 Hey no problem :) good luck. 




 Hopefully not too long. 




 Ha, ha never :) 




 Ha, ha my sister and her bf of 6 years recently had a kid, she's almost two. Anyway she asked "what's that?" Talking about her vagina when she was getting changed so my sister told her "that's your wee lady" (we're Scottish so imagine the accent). Then the next day she's naming and pointing at my body parts when she's visiting me. Eyes, nose, ears, mouth, hair, wee lady. I'm so happy I wasn't in public but I burst out laughing! :D 




 I like your thinking! :D 




 Oh god, that wasn't even funny embarassing, I hooe your husband was ok :) 




 I don't know I'm not god. I can't answer this but I still have faith. I'm going to stop here cause I don't want these comments to turn into a religious battle (ha, ha battle with swords and stuff) but if you want to talk feel free to pm me. It's up to you :) 




 Ha, ha that must've been bad :) I mean do you laugh at it now (even though it was likely embarassing at the time) or do you still try and forget about it?
