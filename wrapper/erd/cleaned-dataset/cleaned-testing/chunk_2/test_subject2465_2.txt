Halfway through, the cops come in and tell them what happened and they move to another room 




 Again, why does that mean you have to kill people? 




 Lets not ignore RACISM AND WHITE SUPREMACY as well 




 we have video from inside the event that was live-streamed and you're saying its staged? Hilarious.  




 is not stoning people for eating shrimp not against the bible? 



















 Yeah they are. LOL
 














 
Why can't muslims respect western values of freedom of speech? 









 Well, they are geographically closer to islamic countries 




 they just hate being held accountable for their voluntarily held beliefs.  




 Something I wrote a while back when someone said I couldn't "prove" barack is an atheist, or at least really someone who is privately very liberally religious.

***About his mother*** *"This isn't to say that she provided me with no religious instruction. In her mind, a working knowledge of the world's great religions was a necessary part of any well-rounded education. In our household the Bible, the Koran, and the Bhagavad Gita sat on the shelf alongside books of Greek and Norse and African mythology. On Easter or Christmas Day my mother might drag me to church, just as she dragged me to the Buddhist temple, the chinese New Year celebration, the Shinto shrine, and ancient Hawaiian burial sites. But I was made to understand that such religious samplings required no sustained commitment on my part. Religion was an expression of human culture, she would explain, not its wellspring, just one of the many ways and not necessarily the best way  that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives."*


His biological [father](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama,_Sr.)? Atheist.

His [mother](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/obama/chi-0703270151mar27-archive,0,2623808.story)? Atheist AND anthropologist (understanding human society and behavior)

His [grandfather](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Armour_Dunham) and [grandmother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madelyn_Lee_Payne_Dunham) that raised him? Both vocal atheists (talks about this a lot in his books)


Simply put: Black people aren't getting elected if they're not religious.

Visit [**/r/BlackAtheism**](/r/BlackAtheism) more and we discuss this in detail.

Quotes like this and that [speech from 2006](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvKX16Eygs0) he did where he espouses his problems with referring to the bible show me that hes a closet atheist/very agnostic person that is playing the game of political musical chairs.

Don't forget this: http://i.imgur.com/BVt0i.jpg


He "found" god @ 26 as a community organizer in Chicago and if you know chicago, theres a lot of black people there and you're not going to get famous there, as black man, without the black vote which comes from black churches. He had to play the game.

Grew up in extremely diverse settings, i'm sure having memories of madrasas allowed him to contrast that with the radical christianity in america....

Hes one of the smartest presidents, *on paper*, that we've ever had. Remember, they tried to make fun of him because he went to the best schools in the country? I mean come on as if being a biracial kid raised by a single mother (even though she used to work for the Ford Foundation...LOL) isn't a massive hurdle in life.

Every chance he gets hes always promoting STEM fields and human achievement. Not willy nilly passive goals. 

He rarely says that prayer influences his decisions a-la Bush 1 or 2, or even the possibly closet atheist that clinton was said to be. Faith is never a member of his team of decision makers.

When he forgets to pray people blow their lids off and call him unamerican. He left god out of the verbatim recitation of various historical [documents](http://theydontfoolme.com/118/three-years-in-a-row-obama-fails-to-thank-god-at-thanksgiving/) and [speeches](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/25/obama-god-thanksgiving-speech_n_1113295.html) and [9/11](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/09/11/fox-omits-the-facts-to-politicize-9-11/189827)

Hes not religious **At all.**

Every time he opens his mouth about christianity it sounds [forced as hell](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/21/obama-religious-quotes_n_1292116.html).
I'm not going to go into his politics or anything...but I think to call him a closet atheist, is not a far stretch at all. I know /r/atheism loves the "wheres the evidence" claim, but to be honest here. [Obama has had more secular groups at the white house than any other president](http://content.usatoday.com/communities/Religion/post/2010/02/atheists-meet-with-white-house-officials/1) , a point verified by many fundie-right wingers; so i'm sure they'd be honest about feeling threatened. He only refers to religion during times of [tragedy](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/02/obama-on-faith-praying-for-egypt-gabby-giffordsand-for-patience-as-malia-goes-to-her-first-dance-wit/), mandatory events like [prayer breakfasts](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/obama-hosts-easter-prayer-breakfast-with-meditation-on-suffering/2012/04/04/gIQAhW7lvS_story.html)...or when hes [trolling the GOP like he recently basically said "this is what jesus would do,"](http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/02/news/economy/obama_tax_rich_jesus/index.htm) to try and convince them to adopt his politics.

He trolls religion regularly. Its obvious. Why else do you think all the fundies are scared they would lose their privileges under him? [He even campaigned on eliminating faith-based initiatives](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/05/obama.faith.based/) but after the backlash following his election he was forced to backtrack and reinforce the initiative with a "faith office". On top of that, don't forget him trying to get catholics to pay for birth control...  [hes trolling catholic church hospitals these days](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/health/policy/obama-administration-says-birth-control-mandate-applies-to-religious-groups-that-insure-themselves.html). I'm certain that even slightly religious people would have more "respect" for people of faith and their autonomy. 

Obama has supported gay-rights [WHOLEHEARTEDLY](http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2007/12/11/the_obama_questionnaire/
) since 1996 AT LEAST

No one in politics or academia believes him; Even people with different views don't believe him:

[Chris Hitchens](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITsYUjv_aEA), [Richard Dawkins](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/richard-dawkins-barack-obama-probably-is-an-atheist-lincoln-kennedy-clinton-too/), [Ann Coulter](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ann-coulter-on-the-other-obama-rumor-hes-not-muslim-hes-an-atheist/), [Lawrence Krauss](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-Lk7gHEfK4), [Pat Buchanan](http://townhall.com/columnists/patbuchanan/2012/02/21/creators_oped/page/full/), [Franklin Graham](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/21/franklin-graham-questions-obama-romney-on-christian-faith/), [Pat Roberson](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/robertson-warns-of-looming-secular-atheist-dictatorship), [Bill Maher](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/01/13/bill_mahers_campaign_prediction_obama_will_come_out_as_an_atheist.html), [Penn Jillette](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJGxVeQw3SE feature=player_embedded) etc. All of them think hes faking it. Hardcore christians and hardcore atheists.

He also campaigned on getting religion out of hiring practices: http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20082217-503544.html

He's the first president to acknowledge non-believers: http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-01-20-obama-non-believers_N.htm
 
Now you want info on Jeremiah Wright? Obama probably only distantly knew the guy. He had to more than likely only show up for appearances to make him seem like he was in touch with the community. 

Here is a point we need to talk about... Jeremiah Wright was caught saying "god damn america"...[but you really don't understand what he was getting at.](http://www.timwise.org/2008/03/of-national-lies-and-racial-amnesia-jeremiah-wright-barack-obama-and-the-audacity-of-truth/) He was saying how utterly fucked up this country has been to minorities. Its true. You can deny it all you want, but he was highlighting a truth, albeit emotionally. He just wanted to say that America should really recognize their ways if they want to embrace Obama. Its kinda that "hey, they don't like me? well damn them!" Jeremiah Wright is not racist. Not at all. But you have to remember the bias white/right-wing america feels to anyone who talks about [white priviledge](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3812249801848706206) or exposes their messed up of institutionalized racism, so of course the clip was crazy. [Obama had to throw him under the bus to move on](http://articles.cnn.com/2008-03-18/politics/obama.transcript_1_perfect-union-constitution-slavery?_s=PM:POLITICS).

Black churches are the greatest source of networking in most urban communities, especially if black leaders are known to attend. Its all a game. I know in ~~Atlanta~~ every major city with a sizable minority population that many times, elected black officials only show up to church in times of election or when they need community support. They adopt a church home only to show their relation to the community. Its all for show. They have to connect with the people some how. Thats what a "representative" (in his case Senator) does.


Name a president who says this in his inaugural speech: 

    *"We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and* ***nonbelievers.*** *We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth."*

He's already the negro, kenyan, socialist, communist, anti christ, who hates America.


Why throw people another bone to hate him for?

Few links outlining many inconsistencies in his "faith":

3. http://johntreed.com/Obamaatheist.html

Here he is making fun clinging to guns and religion: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTxXUufI3jA


There is even a new biography that tackles his introduction to christianity and it sounds...[forced at best](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2018326327_apusobamabook.html): 

**And to cap it off, here is a section from "The Audacity of Hope". Start in the middle of p.198p.206 http://lnk.co/KPZUD . If that doesn't scream "faking it" to you, I don't know what will.**  




 This is basically a recruiting tool for next year's event 




 The wrong country, really 




 False. His grandfather was a staunch atheist. His grandma was a UU 




 Islam isn't a race. Its a voluntary behavior. 

Downvote. 














 The Chinese medicine bullshit part definitely went WAY too left. 

This ain't the old joe   




 LOL at this Chinese doctor.  




 No, but they do have an appearance from a descendant of the Romanov's 









 The NSA isn't going anywhere. Its just too important and the average American doesn't even understand what it does. 




  The Wahabist in Saudi Arabia have been arming every other Sunni group in the ~~Middle-East~~ World

Fixed

 




 its...time.  




 COMPLETE guilty pleasure 




 MORE. RAIL. NOW 









 EVERYONE just forgot about this. Its hilarious.

like 18 hours ago, everyone thought Freddie Gray became the first man to commit suicide in a police van with his hands behind his back 



















 47-0.

I mean, really? 









 or remove the pixelation... #3232;_ #3232; 





























 Jews are by and large "white" 




 He's a white supremacist.  




 Are you stupid?

Asian people got aid from the government to immigrate and build businesses. 

Japanese immigrants got reparations from WWII

Black people get told to "get over" hundreds of years of slavery, jim crow, red-lining, and institutionalized discrimination 

Are you SERIOUS right now?  




 Toxins breh 














 Why would you even want this? 




 South Korea is easily the most racist country in the region 




 Fun Fact: Korea is one of the most racist places on earth. North and South 




 Abu ***Broken*** Al-Baghdadi  














 how about MAKING MORE RAIL LINES? 









 Thats not how genes work 




 I don't mind controversy...but at least CHALLENGE these dudes. Don't let them just spew this crap and stop laughing along with them 




 The "obama" phone thing is a result of a policy Reagan passed ensuring all poor people had access to a phone.  




 This is actually wrong. I have a graduate education in a field in which I'm familiar with how MOA works and what it does.

You...do not.

In fact, you're not even remotely familiar with ANY form of advance biology besides reading pseudoscience from racists.  









 *sigh* 




 First of all theres no indication...NONE it causes you to be "violent"

I'm sure the 400+ years of slavery and essentially reluctance from the government to stop terrorizing black people barely 50 years ago which is barely 2 generations MIGHT have something to do with it.  




 Its too late.

Joe is realizing what he did by letting this monster on:

http://i.imgur.com/LBC8F1P.jpg 









 The hate on SJW is so flawed to me. 

I mean they're annoying but holy hell, complaining that colleges aren't conservative enough? I mean you wanna go back to a time when black people weren't allowed in or students weren't taught to be tolerant? 









 Huh? He's a moderate. Pro weed. Ex military and essentially a rational dude.  




 Does Joe really not understand that Eliot Rodger WAS males rights activist who was frustrated with women. 


He SAID so. Just cause he killed dudes doesn't matter.  




 Well said.

This guy makes Cumia seem like a poor redneck compared to this high-level almost academic type of racism
 




 Do you TRULY not know?

I mean, how insensitive to fellow humans do you have to be? 




 Might as well schedule David Duke.  




 Monoamine oxidase doesn't even do that. 

It's an enzyme to reduce oxygen species. It's a complete misreading of biochemistry. 

You don't even know enough to know that this is bullshit 




 The problem is that he does NOT push back
 




 He's like the insulated libertarian who lacks any legit criticism or insight.  




 Seems tacky. If you're gonna spend that much, just plan your own trip 




 Did you miss the part where GAY MARRIAGE IS NOT THE SAME AS INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE IN A HISTORICAL CONCEPT?!

Goddamn. 

Learn to accept where you're wrong sometimes. 

You can criticize a movement without feeling like you're being attacked.

Grow the hell up son.  




 Bigots like me?

LOL

I asked you to not compare the right to live, with the right to get married. 

Thats all I asked you to do.

I can't be a bigot for supporting gay marriage in all of its forms.

But you need to understand that these are completely separate issues. 




 I'm not a homophobe.

But if you can't understand how FIGHTING BEING LYNCHED and FIREBOMBED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR BREATHING AIR is different from gays wanting to get married...then you're lost. 

I'm an agnostic-atheist and I support the rights of gays getting married.

But don't expect me to compare the two.

let gay marriage stand on its own two feet.

There are tons of non-religious people who are against the idea as well.  




 Money has nothing to do with this?

Are you serious?

You think Freddie Gray WANTED to be selling crack? 




 Why do you assume they are? I didn't say so. 




 What hypocrisy am I exhibiting when I said i'm

1. An atheist

2. Support gay rights 




 I'm. Not. Religious. 

What the hell is your problem? 

And gay marriage is NOT the same as an interracial marriage from the 1960s. 

You can't keep ignoring the whole heterosexual thing then say "its the same"

Its LITERALLY different. 

I support gays getting married, but do NOT compare what black people in the USA fought and died for with gay marriage.e

Do NOT do it.  




 They're different because interracial marriage still presumed heterosexual interaction.  


































 A running total anywhere or social media? 

It would be interesting to compare the impacts 







































 I'm legitimately serious.

I don't see any other politician right now with his track record of success or national appeal who might be able to come close within the state. 

Or Governor? 









 We can argue that he has had some questionable policies and decisions, but his personal life is pretty much as clean as you can ever ask a politician's to be.

I mean, if Obama had ever done so much as taken an extra candy bar, he'd be on the front page and barred from running for POTUS. 

Its just weird seeing the Clintons back in the ring knowing how much dirt they have on themselves.
