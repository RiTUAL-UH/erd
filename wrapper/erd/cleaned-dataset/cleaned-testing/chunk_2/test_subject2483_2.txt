 What do the value investors here think about this? I see it too high, but there are some valid arguments. What do you think? 









 Due to the popularity of my post in another subreddit (which I feel is very useful to anyone who invests), I felt like I should share it with r/investing:
http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/2wvd06/the_intelligent_investor_handbook/ 




 Top two in this subreddit! :D 




 It did not, but neither do I. I just tried to find some sort of proxy indicators that try to measure (quantify) the advice Mr. Graham gives.  




 Your welcome!  




 Thanks for the help! Was actually using that, but now I am certain in what I'm doing. Thanks! 




 Great post deserves more than my upvote! 




 Thanks so much for all the comments. I felt like I wanted to add several things. 

1) The sections are not necessarily the most important.
2) The formulaes are there for those who know them, but can be easily researched.

But most importantly:

3) This is meant to be edited and improved by this great community, so that the I.I. handbook becomes even better. If you feel something is wrong, post an edited/improved version. 




 Explain what ORI does as a business please, apart from a one liner from wikipedia. How is it organised, what are its departments, products, services. By doing so, it will help any ORI investors by being more clear. 




 Hey r/investing! 
I was just very curious if you could answer this question. I'm sure many others will be interested. How do you measure/understand a company's "competitive moat"? Would really wish to know.
Thanks in advance! 




 Time will tell ;) 




 Where do you get your stock market news?
Just read news. In the business sections (also economy/finance/etc.) you will see companies performing good/bad. What news should you read? NYT, Economist,WSJ (for high quality), Business Insider, CNN Money (for more casual).
Do you come up with your investing ideas, or do you find inspiration or advice from some place?
Completely depends on different people. 




 Thanks! 
Sure is a moronic question :D 




 Your welcome! :)
I would be very interested! 




 Hey r/investing! :)
A quick one. When are annual reports published in the US? What about europe/asia? Thank you in advance :) 




 Hey there investors.
During my reading of the book (2003 edit), I highlighted some of the main points I felt that were important for me. I then wrote this handbook, which is effectively a list of these quotations ordered to make a bit more sense. I then added my own notes to add/clarify the notes. 

First of all I just felt like sharing it so that it could help any of you. However, I would also love it if you could add upon it (maybe I omissed some importnat things?). Thank you in advance, and hope this helps you! :)

PS. If you didn't read the book, I strongly suggest you do.

Thanks for the upvotes! First time in my life I'm on top of a subreddit. Im very glad its on this one, I really think its the best subreddit out there! 




 Money weekly YouTube channel. You cannot hate it. 




 ESTJ terran.
But what does the "variant" mean? How many are there? Tried looking, couldn't find (I got assertive).
Same thing to what is a sentinel? (Explorer etc) 




 Countries that have defeated an aggressor in war have the right to claim parts of its land, an unwritten rule in war. Germany tried, and failed, to expand its land. The surrounding nations had the right to take their land. Besides, Nazi Germany deserved the punishment it got, and present day Germany, without all this land, is far better off than at any other period. 




 Best country in the africa! 




 Being Russian, I can tell you: Russians drive similar to many other countries (which are similar). Its just Russians have the cameras (they have more footage). 




 For every gif of an epic widow mine shot you see, there's at least 50 fail shots you don't see done by guys like me. :'(
Widow mines are just awesome to watch, that's why they are posted to often.  




 If thats a school, im not. I live in Paris. 




 Wow, thanks. Will ask if the school has a 3D printer.
