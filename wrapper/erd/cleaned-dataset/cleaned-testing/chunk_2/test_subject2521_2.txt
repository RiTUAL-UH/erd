 The OP has a point. 

Take this for instance: the Dolphin Illusion - a child will see dolphins on the bottle where as, adults see a intimate pose (or most do). Research has shown that young children cannot identify the intimate couple because they do not have prior memory associated with such a scenario.

 It has the consistency of guacamole. Don't be fooled, it's delicious!  




 Yeah I wasn't sure if it fit. It seemed funny at the time. The deal was my boyfriend made her mad and went over to the books and started rolling around. I then said that she was doing this b/c she was mad and was marking the books to say, "This is mine, stay away!". He, on the other hand, thought it meant she wanted to play.  














 We've found a culprit for the bacon shortage..... 




 Decided to purchase a percolator bong - can't wait to try it out, once it arrives! Thanks for the tips! It makes since what you both said, just wanted to make sure by asking the /r/trees community.  




 Our current selection is Super Lemon Haze. We usually use a vape, but decided to try something different since I'd never rolled one before.

 It's worth at least checking out, but the actual game play isn't too great. She's a pain to move around and can't jump worth cr@p.  




 I thought that too, but hadn't played Far Cry 3 in a while.... 




 Using a ruler I found the silver coin to have a diameter of 4cm and the gold ring with a diameter of 4.5cm. 4cm does not equal 4.5cm. 

It still might be a true thing, but the numbers don't add up.

That requires some balls. Of which I do not have. Now I can't complain about poor service. Geez...

 




 Majestic until you get lost. Either way it's creepy, especially when you're not from a huge metropolis like D.C.

 It has the consistency of egg salad and a nice flavor with the smoked tofu. It's a great dish if you can handle the fact it isn't a 'true' Pad Thai! :-) 




 We agree, but it still works. 









 Relying on Toyota for being a cheap car and adhering to the idea that 'chiristians' lead the majority, are not the same thing. 

The first actually brings the idea that other countries control more of what we do than our own industries, advancements, etc. I don't see how that has any relation to removing something from US currency that does not apply to every citizen.  




 The inclusions of such words would imply that those using the currency abide by the idea. Imagine if another deity were represented or something completely against Christian morals. I'm pretty sure hell would freeze over and people would b*tch and complain nonstop.
 




 The US 1st Amendment states that we are to exercise the FREEDOM OF AND FROM RELIGION. Including 'In God we Trust' goes against this, in every way. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_the_United_States 




 Then what's the solution?  




 I know it crossed my mind a time or two, but I rarely took it in to consideration. After meeting Dan Barker a few years back, I began to realize just how much of a problem this was. First off, we (the US) are not solely a 'Christian Nation' and symbolizing such a thing on US Currency only provides more problems. I'm not sure where to go from there because that should make it rather clear, but I would like to point out the fact that (former motto) 'E pluribus unum': One out of many - seemed just fine. 




 **Let me just state that I posted this out of curiosity to see if it remains a problem in other parts of the world. I do not care if you are for or against, I only want to know if the problem actually exists outside of the US. I posted the FFRF url and Wikipedia to show the foundation of the problem...


Here's the link:

"In God we trust " was adopted as the official motto of the United States in **1956** as an alternative or replacement to the unofficial motto of E pluribus unum, adopted when the Great Seal of the United States was created and adopted in 1782.[1][2]
"In God we trust" has appeared **on most** (not all) U.S. coins since 1864[3] and on paper currency since 1957

 Recipes in order: Quick-Cooked Tomatillo Sauce (Salsa Verde), Thick Cream (Crema Espesa), and Layered Tortilla Casserole  (Budn de Tortillas) 

**Quick-Cooked Tomatillo Sauce** (Salsa Verde)

Ingredients: (Yield 2 to 3 cups)

-	1 lb (11 medium) fresh tomatillos, husked and washed OR two 13-ounce cans tomatillos, drained.

-	Fresh hot green chiles to taste (roughly 3 chiles seranos or 2 chiles jalapenos), stemmed

-	5 or 6 sprigs fresh coriander (cilantro), roughly chopped

-	1 small onion, chopped

-	1 large clove garlic, peeled and roughly chopped

-	1 tablespoon lard or vegetable oil

-	2 cups any poultry or meat broth (depending on how the sauce is to be used)

-	Salt, about  teaspoon (depending on the saltiness of the broth)

1.	*The tomatillos*. Boil the fresh tomatillos and chiles in salted water to cover until tender, 10 to 15 minutes; drain. Simply drain canned tomatillos.
2.	*The puree*. Place the tomatillos and chiles (raw ones if using canned tomatillos) in a blender or food processor, along with the coriander, onion and garlic; if using a blender, stir well. Process until smooth, but still retaining a *little* texture.
3.	*The Sauce*. Heat the lard or vegetable oil in a medium-large skillet set over medium-high. When hot enough to make a drop of the puree sizzle sharply, pour it in all at once and stir constantly for 4-5 minutes, until darker and thicker. Add the broth, let return to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer until thick enough to coat a spoon, about 10 minutes. Season with salt.

**Thick Cream** (Crema Espesa) 

***Instead of this recipe, we just mixed heavy whipping cream and sour cream. But, this is the more traditional approach to preparing thick cream. If preparing this, start a full day ahead (or longer, if the incubating spot is cool). The cream will keep for 1 weeks or more, covered and refrigerated. 

Ingredients:

-	1 cup whipping cream

-	2 tablespoons buttermilk

1.	*Preparing the cream*. Pour the cream into a small sauce-pan, set over low heat and stir just until the chill is off, *do not* heat above 100 (lukewarm). Stir in the buttermilk and pour into a glass jar
2.	*Ripening the cream*. Set the lid on the jar (but dont tighten it) and place in a warm (80-90) spot. Let the cream culture and set for 12 to 24 hours, until noticeably thicker (perhaps almost set like yogurt or sour cream). Stir gently, screw on the lid and refrigerate at least 4 hours to chill and complete the thickening. 

**Layered Tortilla Casserole**  (Budn de Tortillas)

Ingredients:

-	Vegetable Oil

-	12 corn tortillas (we used soft corn tortillas)

-	2 cups Quick-Cooked Tomatillo Sauce (Salsa Verde)  *recipe above*

-	3 large chile poblanos (we used 5 Anaheim peppers) -- Roasted, peeled, seeded and sliced

-	1 cups Thick Cream, or thinned commercial sour cream  *recipe above*

-	1 cups (6 ounces) grated melting cheese like mild cheddar of Monterey Jack.

1.	Quick-fry 12 corn tortillas in vegetable oil, 2 or 3 seconds per side, then drain well.
2.	Line the bottom of a 9-inch-square baking dish with 3 tortillas (slightly overlapping).
3.	Top with  of the sauce, cream and cheese, and 1/3 of the chiles; repeat with three more layers (the top will have no chiles).
4.	Cover and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Strew with onion rings, (and radish rounds), then serve.
5.	Optional: 1 cups shredded cooked chicken, pork or fish can be layered with the chiles. 
 









 How well does he get around? I've never met a cross-eyed cat, so I'm curious as to how well they get around. Also, congrats (and thank you) on taking this lil'guy in!  









 I did, but it freaked me out and I wasn't sure if it was a ring or the IUD had moved. Hints why it came as a surprise that the ring wasn't removed.  




 Sadly, no.

 Right on, man!  




 Since it was a ring, it might not be treated the same and can be left in. I just did what I was told, but forgot to take it out.  




 What MILF represents in English and in the US has no assocation to its use in other languages and countries. I understand people found this to be amusing but we can't infer they had any idea what this was showing. 

 




 Damn, I saw this post when it was new and didn't think to post who it was. Just thought it to be common sense. Lame. Should have posted something.  




 Why do people insist on using the animals as a clear mode of entertainment? Recall the story a few months ago, of people stoning animals at a Chinese zoo? It's just as bad. Either way you're using the animal instead of seeing it in its 'natural' habitat.  




 Reminds me of the Admirals Club - but of course, mid-flight. That's a luxury I'd give into if I had to travel.  




 We're looking for sources of milk. It's not a common thing here.  




 We eat a lot of homemade pizza and decided to make mozzarella this time around. There was a clear difference in quality - especially texture - by choosing homemade over store bought. We were giving it a try since it costs about the same. I won't know until we do it again whether or not it's worth doing it from scratch. In hindsight, by preparing it, you know exactly what your eating - so that pays off.

 It's an authentic dish to a region of Mexico.  




 Same information is featured in the cookbook - *Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Recipe
(Arroz con Leche)*

This dessert is softer and more cinnamony than our baked rice pudding. The flavors are simple and close to home, but its easy to develop a thoroughgoing love for it, spoonful after spoonful. Mexican people everywhere serve it as regularly as they do flan; its creamy and, in its own way, light and soothing.

This is an especially pretty and tasty recipe, based on one from Zelayarans Las 500 mejores recetas de la cocina mexicana.

Yield : 8 to 10 servings

**Ingredients**

2 inches cinnamon stick
A 2-inch strip of lime zest (colored rind only),  inch wide
1 cup rice
1 quart milk
 cup sugar
 teaspoon salt
4 large egg yolks
 teaspoon vanilla extract
 cup raisins
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into bits
Ground cinnamon, for garnish

Directions:

1. **The rice:** Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium-size saucepan, add the cinnamon stick and lime zest, then cover and simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes. Pour in the rice, let the mixture return to a boil, stir once, then cover and cook over medium-low heat for 20 minutes, until all the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.

2. **The pudding:** Stir in the milk, sugar and salt, and simmer over medium to medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the liquid shows the first signs of thickening, 20 to 25 minutes. Take from the heat and remove the cinnamon stick and zest. Beat the egg yolks until runny, stir in the vanilla and a few tablespoons of the hot rice, then stir the yolk concoction back into the rice mixture. Mix in half the raisins, then spoon the rice pudding into a decorative 8-inch-square baking dish.

3. **Browning and finishing the pudding:** Preheat the broiler and dot the rice pudding with butter. Set the dish under the heat long enough to brown the top, 3 or 4 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining raisins and the ground cinnamon, and serve warm or at room temperature.


*Techniques*

**Thickening the Rice:** In Step 2, the mixture should be simmered only until the milk takes on a slight creaminess (it will still look soupy). Overcooking will give you something dense and unapproachable. Should the latter be your fate, stir in a few tablespoons of milk just al youre about to serve, dot with butter and brown again.


*Timing and Advance Preparation*

The rice pudding can be ready in an hour, much of which wont involve your direct participation. It may be prepared through Step 2 a day or two ahead, then buttered and broiled shortly before serving.

*Regional Explorations*

Rice pudding brings to my mind the volatile, chancy crowd of Mexico Citys Garibaldi Square, where this dessert, only one of the attractions, sits in huge, milky masses stuck with a raisin or two for decoration. Or sometimes Im reminded of the well-used walkways around the Oaxacan market, where ladies sell it in paper cups at sundown. Or I picture any of a dozen other typical scenes: from rude, makeshift street stands to well-appointed traditional restaurantswhere arroz con lecbe is the thing you have.

 That has to be a pretty rare occurrence, right? Snow in Phoenix.  









 Still working out the kinks while using Imgur sharing features. The pic shown isn't the cover photo for the collection. 

Oh and this was taken in NE Kansas.  




 For those viewing, do you like the inclusion of information or was it too much? I wanted to make this a 'learning experience' of sorts and thought adding information about the dinosaurs and whatever else would be a great thing. 




 The ring was inserted instead of using oral birth control. No matter the type - even low dose - I would always feel sick throughout the day. As so, I used the sample packs to prepare my body for the IUD. I understand the purpose for most women is due to hormonal problems. This just happened to be the approach chosen by my doctor.  




 EXACTLY! Thanks for the reply! ^

Most (if not all) grocery stores (unless privately owned Co-Ops) receive all their produce from the same location. Hints why the UPC codes for produce do not change upon location! This makes express checkouts (self-checkouts) a great thing to use! (Also worked at Dillons in high school so I recall most of the codes....)

Meat providers possibly stay the same, that I do not know. In regards to dairy, well clearly Dillons/Kroger has a different private provider than WalMart - aside from the name-brands that appear in every store: i.e. Silk, Roberts, etc.  




 Care to share the recipe you used?

Sorry for the long reply! The recipe can be found here: http://imgur.com/a/6bnoI. Enjoy! :-) 




 That is the recipe, to some extent. In another reply, I included pages from the cookbook *Fresh Food Fast: Delicious, Seasonal Vegetarian Meals in Under an Hour*. This includes the 'menu page' showing what is needed and then each recipe follows (3 in total). Basically the recipe is more organized in the post I submitted. Sorry again for not responding to you in a timely manner.  




 Hold your horses! I've spent the past hour putting together a reply! (AND sorry for forgetting to recheck this last night!)

 I have hormonal problems and she wanted to wheen me on something before going straight to the IUD.  




 Damn stop with the harsh criticism. I asked nothing of this. Thanks for making me see posting on this subreddit is useless. Might actually stick to receiving advice over Facebook (sadly).  




 No worries, just wanted it to be known that I wasn't that clueless and ill-informed!  




 What's with all the criticism? 

Know what happened on the day I went in to get the IUD? I was sick. Felt like complete sh*t. So know what I did in spite of all of this? I forgot to remove the ring. Hints why I had informed her that I forgot to remove it. 

 




 Whoa there, being educated wasn't an issue. Before getting the IUD, I had read through a lot before deciding to get it. I know how the ring works, where it is placed, etc. It just surprises me that, even when feeling around, she still missed the ring - when I went in for the month check-up, last Friday! I recall stating to her that I had forgotten to take it out and she said she would before inserting the IUD. Clearly she forgot. 

In response to how long to use it, I was (at the time) wearing the 2nd of a sample pack - and yes it was in the span of 3-weeks. Of course now it has been over a month, with the same ring. Of which I did not know was there to begin with. 
 




 Oddly enough they did an ultrasound after inserting the IUD and still missed the NuvaRing. Also, I had the ring in a few weeks before getting the IUD, but I figured she removed it before inserting the IUD. Guess I was wrong. :-/ 









 Why'd you have to do this? You create a troll post about the BEST MUSEUM I HAVE EVER BEEN TO (sucks to live in KS...) and turn it in to this. 

I might post pictures from my trip to the museum. It was quite an adventure and worth sharing! (r/pics?) 




 I like how they automatically assume the child won't be raised properly. Isn't it up to the child on their culture, belief, etc? Say, for instance, a Turkish child was adopted by a non-Turkish family. If they were old enough to comprehend the true ideals of the culture, shouldn't the decision be left to them? 




 Meh 




 That's not until the second paragraph. How it starts out doesn't make you care much for his sake:

THE MODEL girlfriend of Olympic hero Oscar Pistorius spent her final minutes cowering behind a bathroom door after a late-night fight with her gun-loving boyfriend.

They sure do put a lot of emphasis on model. Maybe it's just me and the fact I hate models, Hollywood and the like or maybe I see that tabloids, stories, etc aren't written in an attempt for people to understand the true impact of the situation.  




 Tabloids are trash - that's a known fact. Perhaps this was just a bad article and that's unfortunate. 

I'm not saying it's objectifying in any manner, the fact they used that as a key word in the title makes you wonder if anyone cares about his mental state or more of the fact, who he killed. Why not just refer to her as  Reeva Steenkamp - in the same way why isn't 'athlete' in front of Oscar Pistorius? Model seems to be overused....like it's supposed to hold some significance.  




 I just fail to understand the fuss about it, as long as you're in the comforts of your own home. Since it asked about 'married couples', I wanted to point out the fact you don't have to be married to feel comfortable around each other. I do my best not to 'toot' around him, but it's a natural process the body experiences. And hey, we've grown to laugh at the cost of what others would find grotesque and unappealing - in order to not take everything so seriously and to just relax and understand it's a part of life. 

Taking a shit on your from lawn isn't the same. That clearly includes the public and violation of law.  




 Hell we do that and we're not yet married! Been together almost 2 years and we understand it's a normal bodily function. Not quite sure when we were officially "ok with it', but since we've lived together, it hasn't been a problem. Actually laugh at times b/c he'll choose to fart at the most awkwardly, hilarious times!  




 I'm an overly opinionated, well-educated, secular humanist. Not to mention, I'm a woman, in my mid-twenties and the height (and overall size) of a teenager (13/14 years of age - statistically speaking) No matter when I live, I'm not in the majority. BUT If I had to choose, it would be during the hippie generation (1960s) with a mix of the disco generation (1970s).  




 Steal all their toilet paper, wait about a week, go back, and TP their house with the evidence.


I wouldn't actually do that, but it sounds rather amusing... 




 My mom's bichon frise will react to names - depending upon who it is. If she says my name or one of my brother's she'll get really excited and dart through the house. If we're actually home at the time, she'll go find us. Whether or not it's considered smart, it sure in the hell is adorable! 

She didn't get the dog until we all moved out. At most we're only home a few times a year. The fact she still makes that association is quite remarkable.  




 Thanks! :-) 




 Can't believe I waited until last year to start watching 'Good Eats'. It's a great start for those learning to cook, by demonstrating just how easy of a process it really is! 

All thanks go out to Alton Brown ('Good Eats') and Julia Child ('The French Chef') :-) 




 Sauce was a last minute thing. First we tried melting the fresco queso  (with heavy cream) over a double-broiler, but the consistency was still lumpy, grainy, and the sauce had little taste. We decided to add hand-grated swiss cheese and some of the 4-cheese package varieties from Sargento. Even after using a submersion blender, we couldn't get past the graininess. By then we were too hungry to care (well past 8:30 pm central time). Also sprinkled in cumin, red pepper flakes and whatever else my boyfriend happened to slip it. It added a great flavor, but we will be sure to check out a good recipe next time (instead of just winging it). 




 That does not surprise me. I was (at times) absolutely furious b/c it was taking so long, but I wanted to prove to myself I could do it. My boyfriend typically makes dinner, so this was a chance to both thank him (valentine's day present) and to see if I could make the recipe w/o ending with (as he likes to say) 'f*ck it empanadas!'.

 Choose something you've always wanted to learn/do.

I'm on the same boat and decided to learn to knit, relearn to play the piano and read (about topics that interest me). All require the willingness to learn and excel - but will be well worth the effort in the future!  




 To get my health under control and to focus on researching music and cognitive psychology. Until the first one gets under wraps, I'm pretty much screwed.  




 Basic anatomy of the eye. We clearly evolved to a suitable point, but in retrospect, it's all backwards in how the eye operates.

I have horrible eye-sight and feel this would make a tremendous difference.

Then again, that would require mutations none of us could possibly live to see.  




 It took 25 years until I found out I was a bit of a b*tch. No one ever mentioned it. This finally came to light when my boyfriend brought it up. Don't take that as a bad thing, it has actually reshaped my life - in a remarkably good way.  




 Welcome to my hipster side....know what I do? I walk. I know that sounds lame, but if you live in a city that has a lot of hills and views, you're bound to discover things you never imagined. 

You would also be surprised of the artwork often spread throughout cities. While on one of my leisurely strolls last year, I made frequent stops along the way to find hidden graffiti, and other artwork, down the main street in town.

***This though, would require a lot of walking, and that might not be your thing. 

 




 A lot of college towns do not hire college students and, instead, only hire high school aged students within the city - my story for the past 5 years.  




 I could do without catching the cold, flu, or any virus/disease - period. Eradicating that problem would be superb.
