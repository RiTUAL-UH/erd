 And a Sci fy TV show! 




 The first E-reader I ever saw was a SONY. If they would have had their own online store like amazon theyd be king right now, 




 I read the first one and I liked it a lot. Gonna spread this series out for the next couple years. Great story. 




 Adam Sandlers a great dramatic actor. Reign over me was great too. 




 Yea I see everyone posting dudes, why not party with some hot chick?  




 That movie was way too stylized. I like Fincher more than Stone 




 Paul T Anderson: Stalker movie. All his films are about obsessive men, I would like to see him try a film with an obsessive female lead. 




 Quentin Tarantino with some space pirates and space cowboys? 
dooowwwnnnn 




 Two serial killers fall in love? 




 It's fantastic. Especially if you usually don't read. Most people don't have experience with multiple narrarators, and this book does it great
 




 I just got HBO GO. Don't think I'll watch any new tv series until I watch all of these.. 




 All my friends have tattoos. I'm the only one without one. How often do I have to hear " Bro when you gonna get some ink" . 


never. I don't care for writing on my skin.  




 Visceral? Are you a video game industry journalist? 




 As someone who was running errands all over Miami this morning, why?



Miami fucking sucks 




 Is there any system in place that forces a state to change its laws? Lets say all 49 other states make motorcycles illegal, but there's one state that allows motorcycles. Would the federal government step in and force that state to change its laws? Is there some sort of majority rule?  




 I live in Florida and we are behind the curve on many things, sometimes this state doesn't feel like America. Why cant all states be equal. 




 Would anyone on reddit know which, if any, branch is starving for recruits? 




 I have a marijuana possession misdemeanor back in 2012 that was nolle pros. I also have a couple traffic violations. I'm in college right now and have not gotten in trouble since the 2012 incident. Would any US branch grant me the necessary waiver? I really want to serve, any branch, any position.

I am 22 and in great physical and mental shape. No weed since I was busted. 
 









 While doing all this do I just block out everyone I know? I seriously don't enjoy anyone in life right now except maybe my sister and my dad. My mom is a huge factor in me wanting to leave. 


The military isnt an option because I am disqualified from enrolling because of a marijuana conviction. Right now they don't really need too many recruits so what could have easily been solved with a waiver in the past, now leads to a permanent DQ. 




 I'm tired of my friends, we don't really have the same interests anymore. I hate my mother. I'm bored of everything. I don't want to get a job, I don't ever want to have a boss again. I want to completely leave my life to start a new one. I have no money though. Are there any programs besides the military that allow me to leave home and have a purpose?

 




 Good site, very little matches in my city tho. I'll check it periodically though thank you. 




 Thank you 




 Unlikely or impossible? 




 Three years ago I made the mistake of getting caught with marijuana. I have a misdemeanor charge on my record, I can expunge it. I dream of being an Air Force Loadmaster. By next April I will have an Associates degree. What are my chances of getting a waiver? Does the Air Force need Loadmasters right now?  




 Because I have a misdemeanor drug charge the US military is not an option for me, but I really want to enlist into something and serve somehow. I was looking at the PeaceCorps, and I've read that getting in is a little hard. I'm currently working on getting my degree, so Ill have that requirement met, but one thing i have little to none is Volunteer service. How do I start? Does any one here volunteer? 




 Do you do the same psychedelics or do you experiment with different kinds? For a while, about a year ago, I would try anything I could get my hands on, and I dont recommend that. 




 There's no dependency, but its very hard to say no to drugs or alcohol when I'm bored. 




 Anyone gone fully sober after having experienced drugs and alcohol? Was it hard? Was it worth it? 




 FAVORITE: Open roads at some times, very peaceful driving.
Least favorite: Every thing is far, so walking is never an option. 




 If you already live an active lifestyle it would be beneficial to your activities to attain more strength. Being out there and being and feeling stronger is very fun. 




 At my old job people a brave soul made it known to everyone that they smoked weed, and then since everybody fucking smoked weed anyways, people started meeting up to get high. I already have a group of friends i do that with, so I only smoked with the  coworkers a handful of times. All those people ended up becoming like best buddies. 




 Working out is the best thing for the body. Unless science advances exponentially in the coming years, you're going to be stuck inside your body for the rest of your life. Might as well make it the best body possible. Join a gym or workout at home its all up to you. I started just doing body weight exercise, just to have some strength, and eventually I wanted more strength and joined a gym. Amazing decision that has left me feeling and looking great. 




 I am single right now and it doesnt bother me at all. I was in a relationship for 13 months after having been single for a longtime, and that relationship taught me a lot of things. Lesson one: date someone better than yourself. I dated a girl that had all the same issues in life i had and then some. We constantly were having issues because neither of us had our shit together. Just fucking kids being kids. I plan on being single until i have my shit together. ETA for having my shit together, at least 10 months.  




 Oh wow, thank you! 




 Thank you that's exactly what I was looking for. Best subreddit for that type of trading? 




 Not exactly day trading, but buying some and selling within a week or two, is there a name for that? 




 I guess its called a film producer, but I want to be the guy that reads scripts and decides what gets made, and how large of a budget the film needs.  




 I'm going to another city next weekend, don't want to spend money until I'm there. 




 I'm anti-people, not anti-person. I would be able to feel well in a crowded room only if I got one on one time with every single person there. But when its not one on one, the persons become people. 




 Cookies and cream of course! Just hearing the words ice and cream makes me think of cold pieces of Oreo. 




 Thank you so much for this reply. I really do want to get my degree. 




 Man of Steel had the best action sequences ever in a superhero film.  




 I was for three weeks, until last week when my small set of funds became  $100. I haven't been looking for work because I really want to focus on school, but my parents are making it difficult on me to just focus on school. I already set my school schedule for fall and I'm not really going to have much free time for a job. But my parents keep asking me about my job situation. Ahhh, I'm going to attempt to get a student loan in the fall for some funds. To answer your question, right now at this moment I am happy. But when I leave this moment and place myself  in my near future I get slightly depressed, I fear that I might have to drop a class or two and het a job. 


Not one semester of college have I gone through where I could focus just on school. 




 Homestead FL. The most "southern" town in south fl. What do I like to do here? Drive north. 




 I was thinking about being a server, I did food industry for a year so I thought I had kind of graduated from that, but tips are just so gratifying. Hmmm 




 I'm in college, age 21. 




 I'm going to give the short version of the story: I was a cashier at a sporting goods store for two years and it was really fun, but in the last of month of my employment, work just started becoming a chore. The store manager was getting on my nerves, and a lot of the new employees were boring. The day before I quit I put in a request to get a weekend off, two months in advance, and then I get a text from a coworker that my store manager looked at the request and then in huge letters wrote denied. Her reason was that we had inventory that week. I confronted her about this because it was bullshit. Inventory was on a Tuesday or Wednesday and I was requesting the fri-sun off. She gave me a lot of bullshit and said "well see what we can do". The whole time I tried having this conversation with her she paid me about three percent attention. The next day I accidentally, or maybe subconsciously, woke up 5 minutes into my shift. I felt relief. My mind literally had no urge to go into work. I went to the gym, ate something and then drove to the job, looked for my manager and I told her I quit.


problem is I don't have any income anymore. But at least I don't have to deal with my manager anymore. 




 Guessing the requirements are being white and rich. 




 A drama about high school football in texas/the south. Down there footballs serious business. I lasted two seasons, felt too dramatic. But the first season is worth watching. 




 Just have a Monster hunter be the protagonist for all the films. He has a zany twisted mad scientist friend who's not good with women as his best friend, this friend allows them to travel in time finding monsters.  




 I just hope the opening scene is the same from the first Uncharted game.  




 Nothing was the same, literally 




 Smiles, I would shoot myself in the face with it, and everyone else I meet. 




 Need to watch this one again. 




 Oh yes, love Collateral. 




 Wonderful film, felt like if I was in NYC. Would like to watch more like this. 




 "Barrel of the Planet of the Apes" 




 The correct nomenclature is "apes" 




 I don't agree with your predictions at all. No way is the sequel to a movie that had long legs and great word of mouth going to open less than the first. 




 Sequel to be titled "War of the Planet of the Apes" 




 For a non superhero movie with a mostly CG cast?
