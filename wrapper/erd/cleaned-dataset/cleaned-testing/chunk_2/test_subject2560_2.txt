 Researchers at QMUL have successfully created electricity-generating solar-cells with chemicals found in the shells of shrimps and other crustaceans for the first time. 



















 If your client doesn't currently have any profile and you don't know the outlets you're trying out reach. I'd suggest targeting one or two developing the story specifically for them and pitching over the phone. As other people have said journalists get hundreds of releases a day and if they don't recognise who a release is from they'll probably not even open it unless the headline suggests it's huge news. If you get picked up in one place and send a release to others it stands a much better chance of the story being repeated elsewhere.  




 I'm pretty sure you don't have to eat them or otherwise ingest them so we should be ok.
