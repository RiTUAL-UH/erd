 I'm considering getting a snake or a bearded dragon, but I have no idea where to start. I already have a cat and a small dog (who probably wouldn't care that much), and my cat will try to attack everything that moves. I'm surprised she hasn't gotten any of my fish yet, so my cat is a concern. I don't want to get anything that my cat could potentially harm. I'm sure I could find a weight or something to put on the cage, but I'd still worry. Anyhow, I live in a condo and I am gone for school everyday during the school year and my mom works. Our family also goes upstate a lot, sometimes for about a week at a time, so I would need something that would either be able to travel or that would be able to be alone for a few days. So I suppose my question is, what would be better for my situation: a snake or a bearded dragon? Also, if anyone recommends a snake, what kind? Any information at all would be appreciated, because I have no idea where to start. Thanks!3   




 Hell yeah3 




 I can't pick just one, but Knockin' on Heaven's door by Bob Dylan is in my top 3. It was played at my father's funeral, who was a huge Bob Dylan fan, and that makes it even sadder for me. 




 Thanks!

 I actually found a license plate the other day that said "GODSTD" and I was considering posting it here 




 50% Scottish
25% Irish
25% English

Woo 




 This is why my mother refused to talk "baby talk" to me as a baby. I was also talking in full sentences substantially faster than most babies, whether or not that has anything to do with it. 




 I absolutely love McCrae and have a giant obsession/crush on him tbh. I actually got really jealous about he and Amanda and I realized I needed to take a step back and reevaluate the fact that I'm getting jealous about a man I will never meet and has no idea who I am. Oh my god. 




 God this is gorgeous. I love living in Michigan. I never want to leave. 




 Yeah at this point it should pretty much be underwater-ford 




 Waterford. Represent! 




 Just finished that book, my immediate thought as well 




 You're welcome(: 




 D'aww you're a cutie :3 




 Woo! Message me!(: 




 Hell yeah! 




 Trombone!3 




 You get me. 




 I have been playing guitar for about 3 years, since I was 12. I started trombone in October, and I've played euphonium/baritone since I was 11. I love music, I swear sometimes it's the thing that keeps me sane. 









 As weird as it sounds, I LOVE your eyebrows.

The top one was from when I was two, circa 2000, and the other two are from now, 10th grade. I was a cutie :3 (btw excuse the no makeup but yeah) 




 Ouch. I take it you guys are competitive. We don't technically compete, except for at certain parades and invitationals. 




 Depending on how much we need to work on, usually 2-5 hours. Most of the time it's about 3. 5 hour practices only happen about once or twice a season. 




 True that. 




 Before camp it's at 10 am, after camp it's 1 pm, during the school year it's 6:30 pm 




 I still have school tomorrow :( my internal clock wakes me up at 6, then right when I can start sleeping in, marching band starts. The struggle. 




 That is a good point. I guess I'm just really bitter about them considering selling it. 




 If the city does end up selling that art, I'm going to be so pissed off you have no idea. We all know that if they were to end up getting the money from selling the paintings, then in five years they're going to end up exactly where they are now, unless drastic changes occur  within the city council. 




 You could actually almost put this on r/creepy 




 I love the acoustic version so damn much.

Jiffy! 1:16-1:19 




 Yup, this is it 









 This is it, thanks! 




 I'm late, but I got a rather amazing boyfriend ;3 




 I watched a movie on Netflix a while back, and I just thought about it today. I can't remember for the life of me what it was called. It was about a guy who was a high school teacher or coach or something (if I'm not mistaken) and he has a very sarcastic son. I can't remember why, but the son ends up killing himself and his dad starts going crazy, and I remember at the end he saw his son hanging in the hallway. Sorry for the convoluted description, that's all I remember of it. Thanks!  




 http://imgur.com/vOq5BSr I'm the one on the right, I promise my teeth aren't really that yellow, just the lighting ;-; 




 You're adorable awwh 




 Same problem. I haven't had mine since around November or December. No one seems concerned and say that it's normal. THAT IS NOT FUCKING NORMAL. 




 Well he's really mean in a funny way, and he said that I should STOP breathing. Like all together. XD 




 I'm in segment 1. In Michigan you can start it at 14 and 9 months. 









 Check this website: http://zenpencils.com/ It's very possible, because the art style and context sounds similar to these. 




 Oh my gosh. The other day my high school had a girls lacrosse game against a school in Detroit, we encountered so many girls like this. They pretty much beat us with their sticks too. 




 I do water then paste, and no water on top. Maybe I'm too stupid to brush my teeth but when I do it the other way, the toothpaste all globs off. 




 I'm from Michigan and I definitely suggest filming in Alpena, especially on Long Lake. Parts of the town are gorgeous. 




 And then that cover is the only one you can find at wherever you buy it from and you look like an asswagon carrying it around? Yeah. The Hobbit and The Perks of Being a Wallflower. 




 I still wear acid wash jeans. I love them. 




 It's Franklin Press, not worth a whole lot. Oh well. 




 Ah, that's mildly disappointing. I'll check when I get home tomorrow. 




 I'll check tomorrow when I get home. :) 




 Will do tomorrow 




 Oh my gosh. Will do tomorrow when I get home. 









 Yup .-. 




 And there's the time she referred to my cousin's year-old brother to her "boyfriend" for months 




 Not super exciting, but I was walking with my friend who had bright orange shoelaces, and Charquise stalks up behind us and screams "GIRL DEM SHOELACES ARE CUUUUTE!" and did this snapping thing with her hands and her posse high-fives her 




 It's like "Shar-queece" and she used to put liquid lip gloss on as eye shadow and tried way too hard with everything she did oh my god 




 OH MY GOD THIS IS CHARQUISE I AM CRYING HOW DO YOU KNOW HER. She dated my cousin and was talking about how much she hated white girls right in front of me and was like, "Oh gurl you black in my eyes" I have so many Charquise stories who are you oh my god 




 Agh, I don't think this was it, thank you though! 




 I don't remember what site it was on. I played it maybe 4 or 5 years ago and I still remember it for some reason and would love to play it again. If I remember correctly, you were a guy who was trying to stop these guys from robbing a bank. It was a really silly point and click adventure type game. I don't think the art was very good either, it was a bit ms paint-ish. I remember a gas station and the cashier was a hispanic woman I think. The town was a bit ghetto. I don't remember much about it at all. If anyone has any clue what it is, let me know please. 




 I'm pretty sure this is supposed to be making fun of Ketan Vora 




 Ahah, no he's my friend's younger brother 









 Just out of curiosity, is this guy's name Taylor? He reminds me a LOT of someone I know. 




 I've been listening to this album quite a bit. DAE find it kind of cool how the end of World at Large kind of spills into Float On? 




 There's a hill behind Durant High School in Waterford that's pretty good. I'm sure there are better but I sled there a lot.
