 Throw in a couple house chores, and you're hired! 




 Nonsense: I'm Canadian. Everything about me smells like maple syrup. And I mean *everything*. 




 Aaaaaaaaaaand I'm going to stay away from the washroom for the rest of the year. Thanks a lot. 




 Three years ago, I had a near-death experience. I dont like talking about it, because I cant remember much about the accident itself. That doesn't stop people from pressing me for details, though. *What did it feel like? Did you see the driver? What kind of car was it? Did it hurt? Did you shit yourself?* (Yes, someone actually asked me that.) I understand that we humans are curious by nature, but I get tired of being asked the same questions and not being able to answer. What I do remember are the boring details: spending a tediously long shift at work dealing with unruly costumers, heading outside in the torrential rain without an umbrella, and walking home for what felt like hours. One second, I was being pelted by cloud vomit, and the next, I heard a loud shriek of tires and saw a lifetime flash by in my head. Only thing isit wasn't *my* life I saw. A strangers memories flooded into me in their entirety, and I saw everything from this persons childhood, to her first kiss, to the monotonous days spent sitting at her high school desk. I saw it all.

 nbsp;

Recovery was a bitch. I woke up in a hospital bed pretty doped-up, but still in a lot of pain. The doctors told me I was involved in a hit-and-run incident, and that the police wanted to talk to me as soon as possible. I wasn't able to offer much information, since I had no recollection of the accident. It took an entire year of intense physiotherapy for me to be able to walk unassisted. My hatred for the unknown driver fuelled me every step of the way. As the anger burrowed deeper and deeper inside of me, my family began to notice a change in my demeanor. They eventually staged an*anger-vention*, if you will. Given time and several counselling sessions, I eventually forgave my attacker, so that I could move on and complete the emotional healing process.

 nbsp;

During my lunch break today, I took a walk along the canal and spotted a young lady in a bright pink sport jacket, merrily jogging on the other side. I recognized her immediately: it was the woman from my visions. Her name was Sarah. I gathered that much from a memory of the bear-shaped birthday cake shed gotten when she turned seven. Her name had been scribbled on its stomach in purple lettering. I felt a mix of excitement and dread: that very same feeling you get when you think someones waving at you, but then you realize you were mistaken. Sarah was a stranger, yet I knew everything about her. I ran across the nearest pedestrian bridge, and started following her. Not in a creepy or stalkery way, mind you. I had no ill intentions. I was justcurious. I felt compelled to meet her. Up until then, I had always thought the images that had flashed through my mind were purely fictitious. Now, I had proof of the contrary.

 nbsp;


As I ran towards Sarah, a knot formed my stomach. Part of me felt like a huge creep, like I had invaded her privacy by seeing all of her intimate moments, but the rest of me yearned to appease my curiosity. Had she ever seen *my* life? This girl was real, and I was looking at her, desperately trying to catch up with her rapid pace. I recalled the memory of her parents reading her bedtime stories. I remembered the time her brother had accidentally kicked her in the jaw while they were play-fighting. Shed lost her first tooth then, and she was so proud of it. I also remembered her sitting on Uncle Toms lap as they watched cartoons, and what that monster did to her when her parents were away. I slowed down, feeling a twinge of guilt. Even though I had never asked to know so much about her, it wasn't fair for me to disrupt her life like this.

 nbsp;


Just as I was about to give up and leave, Sarah stopped running. Maybe fate was telling me to go for it. What if I never got this opportunity again? It could very well have been my only chance to talk to her, if only for a moment. I didn't know what I would say exactly. I wasn't even sure if I would tell her about what I knew. Nervously, I went for it.

 nbsp;


"Hey, Sarah!", I called out from a short distance, trying to catch my breath as I jogged towards her. "T-this is going to sound insane, but I-", I began.

 nbsp;

Upon hearing her name being called, Sarah turned around. As soon as she saw me, her face became pale. She looked at me with a mix of fear and disgust, as though I was a rodent shed just found scurrying across her bed. As I bridged the distance between us, she gasped and recoiled, looking at me in shock. I was perplexed: I had no idea what I had done to upset her. Did she think I was some sort of pervert? I remembered that look on her face. She had the same look the night her father had slapped her across the face and called her a whore when hed found her sleeping with some random guy, because she had never learned to value herself. He had kicked her to the curb that night.

 nbsp;


"T-thats impossible. Y-you weren't breathing", she managed to say.

 nbsp;


Suddenly, I realized something: I had seen her face before. Not just in *her* memories, but in *mine*. I had seen her for a split second before I heard the tires screeching. I felt bad for Sarah, knowing what shed been through. I wanted to tell her that I didn't hate her, and that I forgave her long agobut then, she did what she had done the first day our eyes met: she fled the scene. The only difference is that, this time, she wasn't laughing.

 nbsp;

**Update 1 (January 21rst 2015 - 9:00 p.m.)**

 nbsp;

Since I now know that Sarah is real, I looked her up on Facebook. She accepted my friend request before even realizing who I was (my profile pic is of my dog, not of me). I entered into a chat session with her.

 nbsp;

**Me**: Hey Sarah. Listen, dont freak out, okay? I was the guy on the bike path today. I just want you to know that I forgive you for hitting me with your car. Im not going to press charges. I just need you to know that Im not holding on to a grudge.

 nbsp;

**Sarah**: Im sorry.

 nbsp;

**Me**: Theres something else.

 nbsp;

**Sarah**: Wut?

 nbsp;

**Me**: This is going to sound completely insanebut II saw your life.

 nbsp;

A couple minutes go by.

 nbsp;

**Me**: Hey, you still there?

 nbsp;

**Sarah**: Ya.

 nbsp;

**Me**: I know it seems impossible. Butyou know how peoples lives flash before their very eyes when theyre about to die? I got that, but with your life. You probably dont believe me.

 nbsp;

**Sarah**: Got proof?

 nbsp;

**Me**: Your locker combination is 87-15-57. You thought Ryans lips tasted like cinnamon. Uhmyou pretend you hate Katy Perry but you secretly love her songs.

 nbsp;

**Sarah**: How do u kno that?

 nbsp;

**Me**: I told you. I saw your life. All of it. I dont know howbutI was wondering if the same thing might have happened to you? Have you seen my life? Aside from that one night, have you ever seen me before?

 nbsp;

**Sarah**: No.

 nbsp;

**Sarah**: I gotta go. Im really sorry.

 nbsp;

**Me**: I just need to know one last thing.

 nbsp;

Sarah: Ya?

 nbsp;

**Me**: Why were you laughing when you hit me?

 nbsp;

**Sarah**: U looked liek my cheatin ex. Thought u were him. Had 2 get him later.

 nbsp;

Sarah: Bye.

 nbsp;

And then she logged out, and unfriended me.

 nbsp;

**Update 2 (January 21rst 2015 - 11:33 p.m.)**

 nbsp;

I can't sleep...can't stop thinking about her. I'm going to try and find her tomorrow. I'll update you guys as soon as I find her.

 nbsp;

***
**Update 3 (January 22nd 2015  7:45 a.m.)**

 nbsp;

Guys, I'm in trouble.

 nbsp;

I tried to be the bigger man, really I did, but that searing anger inside came back. I promised myself never to feel that hatred again, but I couldnt stop it. I couldn't stop myself.

 nbsp;

As I was walking to work this morning, I kept my eyes peeled for Sarah. I had a hunch Id be seeing her again. Sure enough, I spotted her bright pink jacket from a mile away. My leg was killing me, so I had trouble catching up to her this time. I finally managed to reach her when a passing bus cut her off.

 nbsp;

"Sarah!", I shouted, waving to her.

 nbsp;

She looked a little freaked out, and I cant blame her. I lifted my hands in the air to show her I meant no harm, which seemed to put her at ease. I explained to her that I needed closure, and that I just wanted to talk. I invited her back to my place, and, much to my surprise, she agreed to come.

 nbsp;

The walk to my apartment was awkwardly silent, and more awkward still when she walked through the threshold. How do you host someone that nearly killed you---on *purpose*? I motioned for her to sit down on the table, while I prepared coffee and got some stale croissants from the pantry. I should have done the groceries last night. Once the coffee was ready, I handed her a cup, and sat down in front of her.

 nbsp;

"What I really want to know ishave you ever seen MY life or not?", I asked her again.

 nbsp;

She was quiet, sipping her coffee while keeping her eyes downcast. Why was she avoiding my question? She owed me the truth, so I asked again.

 nbsp;

"Listen, y'know. Whatever the answer is, I wont be mad. I just want to know, thats all. It's all good if you didnt.", I reassured.

 nbsp;

Sarah frowned and shuffled uncomfortably in her chair. I couldn't imagine what this meeting must have been like for her. Then, she shook her head and said no. As soon as that word escaped her lips, I feltintense anger. I hadn't felt like that in a long time.

 nbsp;

"That's not possible!!", I howled, slamming my palm against the table.

 nbsp;

My dog ran into the room and started barking at me, like he had never done before. He'd never shown ANY kind of aggression towards me in the past. His constant nagging growls and barks made my head spin. Before I even knew what had happened, I was on my feet and reaching for Sarah, my hands gripping around her throat. I could feel her pulse through my fingertips.

 nbsp;

"DO YOU SEE IT NOW!? Do you see my life flashing before YOUR eyes now!?!?!? DO YOU SEE THE PAIN YOU CAUSED ME!?", I screamed at her.

 nbsp;

In that moment, something weird occured. I felt as though this had happened to her before. The first time her life flashed before my eyes, I hadnt seen her boyfriend chocking her like this, yet I was seeing it now. I was both myself, holding her tiny twig-like neck between my fingers, and her, being chocked while her boyfriend stood over her in a fit of rage. I was having trouble breathing, just like she was. Blood started dripping on her face, and I realized it was coming from my nose. Sarah stopped moving.

 nbsp;

She stopped moving.

 nbsp;

**Update 4 (January 22nd, 2015  8:30 a.m.)**

 nbsp;

I didnt know what to do, so I went to work, acting like everything was normal. I don't know what to do. It's like the floodgates are open now. Every stranger I bump intoit'sit's overwhelming. I can see all of them...My head hurts so bad

 nbsp;

***

**Update 5 (January 22nd, 2015  9:45 a.m.)**

 nbsp;

She's buried in the garden. I'm sorry. Oh god, I'm sorry. 




 Yes! I think that was it. I remember it had "Deep" in it. Every time I tried Googling it, all I got back was Deep Impact. 




 The Disappearance of Ashley, Kansas. *Shivers* 




 Horror movies don't typically scare me or make me lose any sleep, but there were two scenes in one movie I saw when I was a kid that absolutely terrified me.

I don't remember the titlebut it was a bunch of people on a cruise ship getting attacked by giant slugs. At some point, a dude gets acid slime on him and looks in shock at his hand that has this huuuge gaping hole through which you could see his bones, then the camera shifts to his faceand you see half of it has been melted off.

Worst than that, though was the bathroom scene. Oh, man. This poor woman needed to go, and when she sat down one of the slugs sucked her in through the toilet. I avoided the bathroom at night for YEARS after watching that. 




 That artworkwow. It gets my stamp of approval. 




 That's beautiful. I'm sorry for your loss, but I'm glad you got to spend time with your father. I'll be sending good thoughts you way. 




 You don't need to join me. *I'm already there with you.* 




 Waityou meanHuman Gravy ISN'T your real name?! 




 I name all my pens, and stick googly-eyes on them. There's Robert, Jacob, Felix, Captain Mc.Flufferpants, and Sammy. 




 My characters tend to spastically slap themselves in the face repeatedly whenever they meet someone new, which is exactly what I do IRL. 




 I am not a social man, and I have had few friends in my life. Sal, the bartender at my favorite pub, was one the select few in my inner-circle. I know what youre thinking: hes a bartender, he HAS to be friendly to get a good tip. Youre wrong, it goes beyond that. Id known Sal for over 25 years, and sat across from him at the bar almost every day since we met. When I got married, Sal was my best man. When my wife threw me out, its at Sals home that I stayed. When she took full custody of my daughter, it was Sal who consoled me. He was a good friend, always willing to listen to me and give me advice, like any bartender would. Unlike the other tenders; however, Sal actually cared.

 nbsp;

Now, Sal was a very private man with a rather quiet demeanor. That said, on the few occasions where he chose to let loose, he talked a LOT. Sal had a way of capturing the attention of everyone in the room. This might sound a bit clichd, but hed regale us with stories of his youth. He told us about his cross-country trips, his overseas adventures, his mishaps, and his entertaining anecdotes. When he spoke, his audience sat on the edges of their seats, hanging on his every word as he gave them the juicy details of his endless tales. He was old now, and couldn't travel quite as often. He didn't seem to mind: he always had a smile on his face and a cheerful attitude that brightened the mood of everyone he came across.

 nbsp;

One evening, as I was enjoying a drink, I noticed a man in a booth staring at Sal from across the room. At my angle, I could barely make out his short and spiky raven hair. I pointed him out to Sal, and he told me hed been coming in every night that week, never ordering anything. Sal, being the big softie that he was, couldn't bring himself to kick the guy out. Considering I went to the pub every night, I was surprised I hadn't seen the stranger until that evening. I was probably too drunk to notice.

 nbsp;

Later that night, after drinking one too many drinks---as I tended to do all too often, according to my ex-wife--- I passed out across a row of chairs. Sal trusted me enough to leave me there, even after closing time. I woke up long before dawn, and made my way through the dimly-lit bar to the backdoor, which could only be opened from the inside. This wasn't my first time taking a snooze alone in the bar, so I knew my way around well enough not to run into any of the tables on my way out.

 nbsp;

As I opened the door to the back alley, I heard what sounded like applause, but it turned out to be the sound of three dozen crows taking flight. They hovered above the cold alleyway for a few moments, and then landed on and around the leaky dumpster in the front. I jumped when I saw the damned birds. I'm not afraid of crows, mind you. I even feed the ones at work during lunch. They startled me, is all. A hunters moon peeked through the clouds and illuminated the scene: there was someone standing on the other side of the dumpster, in the forest of crows. It was the man I had seen earlier that night. He had his back turned to me, wearing a black trench coat and boots laced with multiple buckles. There was a large crow perched on his shoulder. Something was odd about his back: a bulky mass moved under his coat, causing it to shift around like curtains in the breeze.

 nbsp;

The dumpster smelled particularly putrid tonight, I thought. I glanced at the stranger, who stood between me and the street. I moved towards him and saw that his crow was chewing on something. At first, I thought it was a gummi worm, but as I approached, I realized it was much darker and oozed crimson blood onto the cold, wet pavement. Then, I saw Sal. He lay on the ground, his body ripped open, serving as a buffet for the hungry crows to feast on. They pecked at his innards, taking turns chewing on his softer organs. I could hear the crunching sounds as they broke apart his bones with their abnormally strong beaks. Bringing a hand to my mouth, I emitted an audible gasp. The sound caught the strangers attention, and he slowly turned to face me. His golden, serpentine eyes reminded me of headlights. Something in his left hand gleamed in the moonlight: it was a short silver dagger, the edge covered in liquid that belonged in my friend's veins.

 nbsp;

I should have been terrifiedangrysadbutI felt strangely calm. My eyes were transfixed on the surreal scene and the man at the center of it all. Though he held a weapon, and though he had used that weapon to murder my friend, I did not feel as though I was in any danger. The man gave me the quiet smile of a Grecian statue, projecting calmness despite the feeding frenzy at his feet. His footsteps echoed down the narrow alley as he made his way towards me. My heart thumped hard in my chest. Paralysed with fear or disbelief, I watched him outstretch a hand to my face, with a gentle elegance seldom attributed to the male gender. The crow on his shoulder tilted its head as its master scraped his long black nails against my cheek. I felt a faint stinging sensation, no worse than that of a paper cut. The man gave me an amused hum as he brought his fingers to his mouth and tasted a few drops of my blood.

 nbsp;

I'm not sure how long it took me to snap out of the shock, but when I finally did, I looked towards Sals final resting place, and saw that there was nothing left of my old friend, not even a drop of blood. The stranger turned his back to me, and a sudden flood of adrenaline compelled me to grab a wooden plank from the floor. I threw myself towards the man, but stopped all of a sudden, when his trench coat slid off. Two massive black wings clutched to his back like climbing vines. Black veins lead to and from the appendages, which flared out with a sound similar to that of an unfurling sail. The man gave me one final look, and spoke to me in a deep, booming voice. "Youll thank me one day.", he said. With that, the crows took flight, and the man disappeared. I was left alone in the alleyway as the sun rose: no evidence of the man, his crows, or my dead friend.

 nbsp;

I tried going to the cops, but what could I tell them? I sat in front of the police station, going over the facts in my mind. Theyd never believe that some sort ofcrow-demon and his army of minions ate Sal. I ultimately chose inaction, hoping Id merely suffered a booze-induced nightmare. It was no nightmare: Sal was reported missing by the pubs owner a few days later. An investigation began, and what the police uncovered shocked even me, who had seen a guy get eaten by a flock of crows. They found evidence linking Sal to no less than 15 cases of missing children. He had kept trophies of their remains hidden in a safe under his bed. Then it hit me: the reason for Sals frequent trips in his youth. Hed been doing the wretched deed far from home so he wouldn't get caught.

 nbsp;

This may sound weird, but I am still grateful for Sals friendship. As I explained earlier, I'm not a very social man. When you get to be over 20, it becomes a lot harder to meet people outside of work, and the friends you do have tend to drift away. Sal helped me through tough times, and Ill always be thankful for his friendship. I still mourn himnotthe bad parts. I mourn the loss of the man I thought he was. It may seem strange to youbut thats how I feel. These days, I've stopped drinking. I havent set foot in that pub since the day Sal died. My ex and I even got back together. I get to see my kid every day, and that is the greatest gift of all. I guess in a way, losing Sal was one of the best things that ever happened to me.

 nbsp;

On my way home from work yesterday, I saw a crow with familiar snake eyes gleaming like headlights. He gave me a knowing nod, and I knew we understood one another. Among the horrific things found in Sals home, they had retrieved a fully-packed duffel bag, a single one-way ticket to Mexico for the day after he was killed, and hundreds of photos of my wife and daughter. The crow man saved them. And that, my friends, is why I smiled to that crow and uttered two simple words: "Thank you." 




 Holy cow, man. I hope you'll find a way to cope with the loss. 




 *Hands the Datha-nathor a feather boa, a top hat, and a flute.* 




 I couldn't take the calls any more. I just couldn't take *knowing*. There was nothing I could do to stop them from coming through; I had to put an end to it.

 nbsp;

It all started this summer, when I was playing with my oldest daughter, Chrissie. My kid absolutely loved toy cars, so I had given her my Matchbox collection, which Id kept in the attic since my childhood. She was driving some farm animal around on the hood of my most prized possession: a classic fire truck with all its original parts and an unblemished paint job, when she suddenly stopped our caravan halfway to Mount Marshmallow Snowflakes, also known as the white leather sofa in the corner.

 nbsp;

"Daddy.", she said, her voice sweet and innocent.

 nbsp;

"Yes, honey?", I replied.

 nbsp;

"Daddy, dont answer the phone.", she told me.

 nbsp;

Having not heard my phone ringing, I wasn't sure what she meant by that. She had probably seen the screen on my Smartphone lighting up from an incoming call. I had a tendency to forget to un-mute the thing after meetings at the office. I guessed that Chrissie didn't want our playtime to end, so I assured her daddy wasn't going anywhere, and left the phone alone. She smiled, and we continued our game. Later, I checked my call history, but discovered that there hadn't been any incoming calls. I didn't really give it much thought, to be honest.

 nbsp;

A few weeks later, the same thing happened while we were playing doctor and giving Mr. Fuzzy Wuzzy his annual check-up. Chrissie looked up towards the kitchen and dropped her stuffed bear.

 nbsp;

"Daddy, dont answer the phone.", whispered Chrissie, in a frightened tone.

 nbsp;

This time, I chose not to heed her warning. I got up to check my Smartphone right away: no incoming calls. Following Chrissies gaze, I realized that she was actually looking at the old telephone on the kitchen wall. We had disconnected the landline and unplugged it years ago. My wife had been asking me to take it down since the day Id cancelled our residential phone services. We had both gotten cellphones and wanted to put the money towards something more useful. The bulky white device was screwed into the wall. I kept forgetting to dismount it whenever I had my tools out, and I was too lazy to get them from the garage for such a menial task. I'm shocked my wife didn't wind up removing it herself, since it bothered her so much.

 nbsp;

"Honey, thats not a real phone. No ones calling.", I told Chrissie, ruffling her hair.

 nbsp;

It took Chrissie a few moments, but she eventually went back to playing as though nothing had happened. It was probably some kind of new game she had learned in school or something. She was seven, and had a bunch of imaginary friends. Maybe shed gotten into an argument with Princess Pufflecakes, and she didn't want to take her call. I didn't worry about it too much.

 nbsp;

It wasnt until the third imaginary call that I started to get concerned. Chrissie and I were having a Ninja Turtles Tea Party. I was dressed in a pink tutu with Michelangelos bandana and a crown on my head ---*never* underestimate what a father would do to put a smile on his kids face--- and got up to get more juice. Chrissie grabbed me by my frilly skirt, looking absolutely terrified.

 nbsp;

"Daddy, dont answer the phone.", she pleaded.

 nbsp;

There was something in her eyes that compelled me to put an end to her weird game. She really looked freaked out: I no longer thought she was playing some kind of reverse-psychology Simon Says. If she was making it up, why did she look genuinely worried?

 nbsp;

"It might be important, squirt. Dont worry. Daddy will tell those evil telemarketers to leave you alone.", I playfully replied as I snuck out of her grasp.

 nbsp;

I made my way to the kitchen, where I picked up the receiver, and turned towards my daughter to give her a reassuring thumbs-up. Bringing the receiver to my ear, I fully expected to hear silence. Silence, however, was not what I heard. There was static on the line, which surprised me enough that I pulled the phone away for a moment to look at it in disbelief. When I brought it back to my ear, I heard a voice on the other end.

 nbsp;

"232 Jeanne DArc Road, fire, 12.", whispered a man tonelessly.

 nbsp;

"What the fu---fudgesicles?", I answered, perplexed.

 nbsp;

My wife must have been playing a trick on me. She had probably convinced Chrissie to help her out so Id do my job and get rid of the phone. I immediately yanked the cord, and it came flying towards me, hitting me square in the face. I was stunned: it was far too loose to have been in the jack. When I asked my wife about it, she had no idea what I was talking about.

 nbsp;

The next morning, I absent-mindedly checked my emails while the news played in the background. There was a segment about a fire in an apartment complex. At first, I didn't pay it much attention, but then I heard the address: 232 Jeanne DArc Road. Twelve residents had perished in the inferno. I nearly dropped my #1 DAD coffee mug on the floor. I didnt know what to do. It was too late to call the police and tell them Id gotten a creepy warning call about the fire. Theyd think I was a nutter, or an attention-seeker. I took a moment to calm down and rationalize what had happened. It was just a very weird and very scary coincidence.

 nbsp;
 
Days later, I was playing Sudoku on the couch when Chrissie walked over, wearing a worried expression on her face.

 nbsp;

"Daddy, dont answer the phone.", she whimpered, tears in her eyes.

 nbsp;

Something in the pit of my stomach told me not to go, but I had to know. I made my way to the kitchen and picked up the receiver. This time, a British-sounding woman spoke to me through the disconnected phone.

 nbsp;

"15 Vanier Street, fire, 3.", she announced.

 nbsp;

Logically, youd think Id go to the police or fire station to tell them what was going to happenbut heres the thingI've watched the shows, so I know how these things pan out. You've got an attractive male protagonist who gets a forewarning, which is accurate: I won the most handsome daddy of the year award, as decided on by my very unbiased daughters on fathers day last year (I even have a trophy to prove it). The protagonist then tells the cops about his predictions. Naturally, the cops accuse *him* of being the perpetrator. They lock him up, but he gets out on some technicality, then rushes to the scene of the would-be crime and saves the day. He becomes a true hero in the eyes of everyone. Close curtains. Yeah, I'm not *that* guy. I'm not saying I'm a cowardbut, lookI've got two daughters to care for. I cant go putting myself in dangerous situations where I could realistically wind up dead. Instead, I bought a disposable phone and used it to call the police.

 nbsp;

In the past ten years, there have been a lot of suspicious fires in our city, leading police to suspect theres a pyromaniac on the loose. Thus far, he or she has burned down: a church, a postal office, an outdoor mall, and a smaller post office inside a mall. I'm going to let you take a wild guess as to what the police officer had to say when I warned him about the potential fire at 15 Vanier Street. If you guessed, "He accused you of being the pyromaniac and asked that you turn yourself in.", then you deserve a cookie, because thats exactly what happened. I hung up and tossed the phone in a trashcan across town. The next day, I watched as a news crew covered the story. The authorities had sent police officers to investigate what turned out to be an abandoned building. Three officers had gotten locked in the basement. A fire broke out, and none of them made it out. I felt guilty and powerless. If I hadn't warned them, the cops wouldn't have been in there, and no one would have died. It was my fault. I couldn't sleep a wink that night, the horrid feeling in my gut eating away at me.

 nbsp;

The process repeated over the course of the next few months. Chrissie would ask me not to answer the phone, Id pick it up, and Id hear a different voice speaking. Id be given an address, method of death, and amount of people killed. 89 Oosgrove Avenue, knife, 1. Mrs. Larkin had been stabbed to death during a home invasion. 60 Star Circle, gas leak, 10. The Campbells were enjoying a family reunion, and failed to notice the smell of rotten eggs. 79 Jean-Jacques Lussier, gun, 3. Maria, Jamie, and Alison were shot dead while walking home in the early hours of the morning, and so on and so forth, until I just couldn't take it any more. I remember all their names and faces: I saw them on the news reports. I think about them when I go to bed, knowing that there was nothing I could do to save them, but tormented by the fact that I didn't even try. Depression started to creep over me, and I could barely eat or sleep. My wife started to get worried, but I couldn't tell her: I was afraid shed be disappointed in me for my inaction, so I lied. I told her I was stressed out because of work.

 nbsp;
 
A few weeks ago, I had finally had enough. Unable to keep myself from answering these phantom calls, I decided there was no other option. I stormed into my garage, grabbed my tools, and desperately unscrewed the phone from the wall. As I held the device, I felt a wave of anger rush over me. This thingthis damned telephoneit had caused me so much grief. I took it to the driveway, and furiously smashed it into the concrete with a hammer until there was nothing left but dust and debris. When it was over, I cleaned the mess. The sensation of freedom was euphoric. My whole body tingled as my heavy burden lifted from my shoulders. That night, I made our favourite family meal and dessert to celebrate. My wife was relieved that I had gotten over what ever it was that had been bothering me, and overjoyed that the eyesore in the kitchen had finally been removed.

 nbsp;

I have a piece of advice for you. If you have a disconnected landline and havent gotten around to removing it, please take a lesson from me: get rid of it immediately and, above all else, do NOT pick up the receiver.

 nbsp;

My life has returned to normal since I got rid of the wretched phone. As I am typing this, my wife is giving our youngest daughter a bath. I can hear them singing the bubble bath song and giggling. Chrissie is in the living room with me. Shes playing with this silly pink Disney phone. Its one of those fancy schmancy glittery toys: a pimped out version of the Fisher Price rotary phone I used to have when I was a kid. Every dial projects a message from one of the Disney Princesses. Its weird, shes never shown any interest in it before. Its not a real phone: it doesn't even have a cordbuttheres that look in her eyes again. Shes worriedI know what she wants to say. No: its just a toy. Its just a toy. Its just a toy, butIm going to check. I need to know





Shit. Shit. Shit. I can hear static on the other end.





I-its a mans voice...Hes sayingits my addressp-propane explosion4





I need to get my girls out of here. Pleaseplease dont let it be too late 




 The tip of one of my fingers is slightly crooked (thanks a lot, dad's genes). So, naturally, people IRL call me a heathen and a monster, and it's only normal for me to go out and try to eat them at night. I would therefore not mind it if my kind are portrayed that way.

In all seriousness, though. If the reader can't tell the difference between the opinions of your CHARACTERS versus YOUR opinions, then there's something wrong with THEM. 




 Good job, Ben! 




 It hasn't happened to me, but if it ever didit wouldn't bother me if the artist didn't ask permission. I would just hope that a. They link back to my story, and b. They tell me about it so I can gawk at the artwork and scream with joy. Unless said fan art was made using the real blood of the artist's victim. Then, I'd be screaming for a whole different reason. 




 Welp, I'm going to go curl up in the fetal position and cry myself to sleep now. 




 I love this story so much, I've actually listened to both the NoSleep Podcast version and the Chilling Tales for Dark Nights version.

...when you say "brought it to life", you mean the story...or the scarecrow corpse? DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN.

 Happy day of womb-expulsion! My two all-time favorites are:

and 


 [Grow Up](http://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/t94dh/grow_up/)

It's from Library of Shadows instead of NoSleep, but it is so awesome. Words cannot describe the love I have for this one. 




 That's some pretty solid advice, o wise one. I think I, myself, will follow it, too. I tend to feel like an evil creative genius when I start to write. By the time I get to revisions, my confidence has gone down a few pegs but I typically still like the story. When I post it; however, I suddenly hate everything I write and feel like a complete fraud. And then I panic.

You're absolutely right: we write because we love to write. Sure, some stories are going to be hits and some will be misses, but that's life and those hours spent working on writing the stories were good, enjoyable hours. 




 Yeah. In hindsight, that tattoo of the green power ranger I got on my cheek was such a bad decision. I *knew* I should have gone with the blue one. 




 Of course. Was I not supposed to? I also promised him yours. Figured you wouldn't mind. You're all about the knees anyways, yeh? 




 My cat Dash got his name for typing a dash symbol on my keyboard a half dozen times.

Also: that screen name! Holy cow. Creepy!

 That's an awesome idea. I would definitely buy it. 




 I can never get enough of horror podcasts. I will definitely be tuning in from now on.

I very shyly wonder if you'd be interested in [Do You Think It's Still Alive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2lpxo6/do_you_think_its_still_alive/)? 




 I wake face-first on the living room floor, my eyes greeting an unusual sight: an empty bottle of booze and a splatter of blood. It's morning, and I can smell alcohol on my breath. I jolt to my unsteady feet and wipe my drool-coated face on my sleeve. Hung-over, I check myself quickly for any obvious physical injuries that would explain the blood, but everything looks fine. I stagger to the bathroom and reach for a tissue, clearing my congested nose. No blood: the splatter wasnt from a nosebleed, thats for sure. Where did it come from? As I inhale, I notice a pleasant citrusy scent in the air. Does the house usually smell like lime?

 nbsp;

My head is throbbing with pain. Feels like a thousand sweaty construction men are jackhammering my skull. It hurts so bad that I use the wall for support as I head towards the kitchen. I know the key to nursing a hangover is to drink plenty of water. I reach for the fridge, but stop when I think to check my phone. Avoiding the blood splatter near the sofa, I extend a hand towards my cell, fully expecting a message from one of my drinking buddies calling me a motherfucker for getting into a brawl with him last night. Im sure thats how the splatter got there. Jimmy or Ramirez and I probably got into an argument about the fucking hockey game again, and I must have socked one of them in the face in my drunken stupor. To my surprise, I dont have any missed calls or text messages complaining about it. Huh.

 nbsp;

I take on the painstaking task of going to the kitchen again. My parched throat is begging for some hydration, but I hear a knock on the door before I can even reach my destination. I approach the window and peer outside. OH SHIT! OH SHIT! OH SHIT! Its the cops. Holy fucking shit. Was it Ramirez!? Is that Habs-loving asshole pressing charges!? I look at the blood splatter, and then and at the squad car. Shit. This doesnt look good at all. My pulse, as they say on ER shows, feels thready, like I ate one too many cheeseburgers. I cant think. Theres so much noise in my head. Feels like my brains about to implode. How could he call the cops over a stupid drunken argument? Sleezeball. Ever since he graduated from law school, hes been such a stickler for the rules.

 nbsp;

The doorbell rings.

 nbsp;

Theres no time to clean up the mess. Im just going to have to deal with it. If they book me, they book me. I open the door.

 nbsp;

"Good morning, sir.", says the officer in a chipper tone.

 nbsp;

Who the fuck gave this guy the right to be so cheerful at this ungodly hour? Its barely 8:30, for crying out loud! I keep telling myself to be polite. I force a smile and step aside to let him enter when he asks to come in. At first, neither he nor his partner seem to notice the blood.

 nbsp;

"Were looking for a boy. About 12 years old.", he tells me.

 nbsp;

That cant be right. II would never hurt a kid. Panic starts to set in, and I frantically step towards the living room, hoping the cops are going to leave. The partner seems to notice my movement, and nods towards the living room. Both cops look at the blood. I start babbling incoherently about being innocent, begging them to believe that I would never kidnap or hurt a child. I loosely explain that I smacked a friend in the face the night before and that its his blood. Its not a complete lie, since even I dont know the truth. The expressions on their faces shift from serious, to confused, and back to serious.

 nbsp;

"Sir, Im afraid you misunderstoodwere not accusing you of kidnapping. The boy is a suspect. Were just questioning the neighbors to see if anyone witnessed something last night.", he reassured.

 nbsp;

"A suspect? What, did he TP someones yard?", I ask curiously, while a sense of relief washes over me.

 nbsp;

The cops explain that the boy flew off the handle and decapitated his parents. Daaaamn, remind me never to take a kids cellphone away from him. With morbid fascination, I ask about their heads, as I walk towards the kitchen for that bottle of water Id been planning to drink all morning. The officers give my living room a quick glance, and then follow slowly behind.

 nbsp;

"We found the dads head in their garage freezer. The momswellno luck yet.", one of them tells me.

 nbsp;

I open the fridge door and I throw up at my feet almost immediately. All things considered, my body feels a lot better now that Ive vomited, though I cant say the same for my psychological well-being.

 nbsp;
 
"I found the mom.", I say.

 nbsp;

Her lifeless head is on the top shelf, on a nest of blood-soaked rags, sitting between a carton of expired OJ and my cleaning products. There's a post-it note on her forehead that says:

 nbsp;

"U were waking up. Couldn't finish cleaning. Lol. BBL"

 nbsp;

I hope my insurance covers therapy, because when the shock wears off, I think I'm going to need it. 




 Just a friendly head's up: the hyperlink to "There's something inhumane south of Seattle if you want to go looking for it" incorrectly brings you to "The Girl in the Log" instead. 




 gWhen I was around seven years old, I had a hamster called Creamie. Did you pick up on the very subtle hint in her name? Yes, the noisy rodent was cream-colored. Every night, my mom brought her cage down to the basement to keep her midnight antics (Creamie's, not my mom's) from waking us. Creamie had been my companion for the better part of three months before she croaked, like hamsters are wont to do. Most parents are careful about how they announce the death of a beloved pet: they explain that it has gone to heaven, lie about it running away to join the circus, say it moved on to greener pastures, buy a replacement and hope their child doesn't notice the patch of black fur on its face that wasn't there before, etc. Not my mother, no. Mom liked to do things a little differently.

 nbsp;

"Honey, I need to talk to you.", mom said, as I ate my sugar-coated cereal.

 nbsp;

"Mmhmm?", I replied, unwilling to draw my eyes away from the cartoon playing on TV.

 nbsp;

"Its about Mrs. Cream.", she continued, getting Creamie's name wrong for the millionth time.

 nbsp;

Mom reached for the remote control and turned off the TV to get my full attention. It always annoyed me how she interrupted my shows with no regards for my feelings. I had learned from experience not to do the same to her when I wanted attention. Id once turned off Quantum Leap during the season finale, and she flipped out. As punishment, she took away my Polly Pocket toys for a week.

 nbsp;

"Yeah?", I asked, trying not to sound annoyed, so I wouldn't get scolded for giving her attitude.

 nbsp;

"Im sorry dear, but Mrs. Cream got eaten by the monster in the furnace.", she announced, without hesitation.

 nbsp;

Mom knew exactly how frightened I was of the large metallic furnace in the basement. Every time it shifted on, it released an intimidating and demonic gurgle. To make matters worse, it continually emitted a sinister red light, like some kind of a Disney movie villain. I swear, even now that I'm older, Im afraid of going anywhere near it. If I wasn't sufficiently scared of the furnace before she told me about the monster, I sure as heck wanted to steer clear of it afterwards.

 nbsp;

Reading the fear on my little face, my mother smiled and continued:

 nbsp;

"Oh, didnt I tell you about the monster in the furnace? Its a dreadful beast. When it gets loose, it grabs sleeping little girls that dont cover their feet and drags them under the bed, where it eats them in a single mouthful. We moms have to keep our kids safe by feeding it your pets from time to time instead.", she explained.

 nbsp;

Needless to say, I was unable to take another bite of cereal, and dropped my spoon into the bowl. While I gazed at my mom wide-eyed, I could feel myself trembling with fear. She was an adult; there was no reason for her to lie to me. I knew I was going to have nightmares. Through a flurry of terrified thoughts, I wondered what would happen now that I no longer had a pet to sacrifice to the creature. Would it come after me tonight? I rarely tucked my feet under my blanket: I liked to let them dangle off the edge of my bed. Was I going to have to use a sleeping bag to stay safe? A question popped out of my mouth before I even had a chance to process the thought:

 nbsp;

"W-what ddoes it look like?", I asked my mom, not really wanting to hear the answer.

 nbsp;

She smirked wickedly, and abandoned me to retrieve a box of animal index cards shed bought to help me learn French. I was left alone with my imagination, which filled in the gaps and made the monster even more terrifying. I kept looking at the floor, expecting to see the unknown creature scurrying about the black-and-white linoleum kitchen tiles. Mom returned, and began flipping through the index cards until she found the ones she was looking for. She turned two of them towards me: a scorpion, and an anglerfish.

 nbsp;

"It looks like a combination of these.", she told me. "Its about the size of a cat. Its body is similar to this scorpion here, but longer and with more feet, and it has a head like this, but with three rows of fangsand eight eyes."

 nbsp;

The creature sounded more and more horrific by the minute. I could picture it skittering about the basement and trying to grab me while I played alone down there. Blood drained from my face and hands. I felt like crying, but somehow the fear kept my body paralyzed, and tears did not flow.

 nbsp;

"Whawhat are we going toto do? I-I dontI dont wanna be eaten", I stuttered, on the brink of despair.

 nbsp;

My mother gave me a small, reassuring smile.

 nbsp;

"Dont worry, honey, Ill go buy a guinea pig later today in case it gets hungry again.", she answered, sounding quite satisfied with herself.

 nbsp;

And that, my friends, is how my mother kept me from feeling sad about the death of my hamster, and the many pets that came after it. Though there is one thing that always bothered me: I still dont know how she managed to get rid of all their bodies so fast. 




 Saw your post in the OOC. Sounds like you're talking about Gurgles   Bugman:

http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/othwh/gurgles_bugman/ 




 I'd say maybe 5 solid deaths and about 5-6 mushier ones. I meaninsinuated deaths. 




 A poor, innocent cat!? You *monster*. 




 I get up at 6:00 a.m. Eastern time and start working between 7:00-7:15 a.m. by choice. I prefer working earlier (while no one is around) and getting to leave earlier than facing traffic.

I was kind of wondering if everyone up in the morning here were from other time zones. 




 Thank you bot! : } 




 *Steps away from Kneeod slowly* 




 Well, someone came in on a load of turnips, huh?

I'm no psycho-analyst, but one would argue that if horror scares you, it's because you're able to identify with the protagonist and, y'know, EMPATHIZE with him/her. (Jump scares aside, that is.)

Thanks for the link. I had a good laugh. 




 Maybe she meant the Avatar: The Last Airbender movie, which was horrifically bad. 




 Note to self: bring padding. 




 I think I will! I'll learn as I go.

Quick question: does anyone bite? 




 Sadly, I have no idea what this is. When ya'll posted about it a few weeks ago, I tried to find the original post explaining it, but failed. Then food distracted me. 




 "Pay no attention to the corpse in the back.", said the professor, as we entered his classroom.

 nbsp;

Thats how my second term Biology class started. I was in University, fresh off my winter break and mourning end of a good holiday season. I had stayed on campus and spent my time getting drunk with my buddies. The fun was over, and it was time to get back to studying. I had looked up my bio teacher, Mr. Blackburn, on Rate My Professor the night before, yknow, to know what to expect. His reviews were underwhelming: the guy was apparently a total bore. Students said he was monotone, never joked, and never cracked a smile. Thats why I was surprised at the state of the corpse in the back of the room. Mr. Blackburn didn't strike me as a funny man, but I guessed he must have had a bit of a devious streak in him.

 nbsp;

The body had been placed behind a row of discarded tables and broken chairs. It sat on a sturdy wooden crate, wearing a civil-era uniform. There was a sombrero on its head and a pine air freshener dangled around its neck like a lame gangsta medallion. Again, I didn't peg Mr. Blackburn to be the kind to joke around. Maybe the old coot had grown a sense of humor, or maybe hed lost his marbles overnight. Either way, this being Biology class and all, I figured the body was there for a reason other than giving us a good laugh. I squinted and examined the corpse. It looked old. I dont mean it was decomposing, mind you. Heck, it was so well-preserved that it didn't even emit an odor. I mean the person it used to be was an old man. Its skin was shrivelled up and mummified-looking. Its arthritis-ridden arms stretched out at sinister angles that reminded me of tree branches in the dark. I looked at its face and saw its mouth and eyes were wide open, giving it an appearance of shock and terror. Man, must have been a rough death.

 nbsp;

Mr. Blackburn started the lecture. He certainly lived up to his reputationand by that, I mean, I fell asleep after ten minutes of hearing him drone on and on. In fact, I cant recall a single lecture that didn't end with me dozing off.

 nbsp;

After class, the other students and I exchanged theories about the corpse and why it was there. Over the next few weeks, we started to notice that someone, presumably Mr. Blackburn himself, changed the body slightly between classes. Trying to figure out what the prof had done to it became our new pastime. Sometimes, its arm had been repositioned, other times, it was several feet away from its starting position. Even its eyes could, at times, be spotted looking in a different direction. The corpse became our creepily awesome mascot. Whenever Mr. Blackburn caught us looking at it; however, he would clear his throat to draw our attention to the front, and repeat what he had told us on the first day:

 nbsp;

"Pay no attention to the corpse in the back.", hed say slowly, his voice colder and harsher.

 nbsp;

It was weird, because he had this gleam in his eyes whenever he told us not to look at it. I swear, it was like he was taking pleasure out of knowing we were peeking. He had the exact same look a toddler has when he drops his trousers in front of a group and lets loose on the carpet, knowing hes doing something wrong but relishing the moment anyways. There was something off about Mr. Blackburn.

 nbsp;
 
One snowy afternoon, Cynthia, a really hot chick that sat across from me, dropped her pen. It rolled to the back of the class and stopped right between the corpses feet. She sighed loudly, looking more annoyed about having to get up than frightened to approach the body. Now, Id been pining over Cynthia since the start of the semester, so it was only natural that I turned my head to check out her fine behind as she bent down to pick up her pen. She suddenly shrieked like a harpy, and I knew exactly why.

 nbsp;

"HES STILL ALIVE!!", she yelled, confirming my suspicions.

 nbsp;

The class erupted in laugher, assuming she was playing some sort of trick. I knew better: I had seen it move, too. Its foot had twitched ever so slightly when she reached for the pen. I even saw its contorted fingers barely outstretch, as if trying to grab her but not having enough strength to do so. I overheard someone making a joke about the stiff trying to check out her rack. I was too freaked out to respond. Cynthia threw the pen at the body and ran out of the classroom, frantically dusting herself as though there were bugs all over her. The class erupted in indiscernible chatter. Upon hearing all the commotion, the teacher stopped his lecture. He calmly turned his attention to the corpse, and then to the rest of us.

 nbsp;

"Class dismissed.", he said, in a calm and unaffected tone.

 nbsp;

Mr. Blackburn straightened his papers, collected his things, and calmly exited the classroom without another word. His nonchalance seemed to put the room at ease. Had the other students seen what Cynthia and I had seen, I'm not sure they would have left the room cheering about their good fortune. I overheard someone say the teacher had probably rigged the body with electrodes or something to cause it to jerk. I wanted to check, because I wanted it to be true. Still, as the mass of students barrelled towards the door, I felt compelled to follow and leave with them, like a mindless lemming. In hindsight, I regret not examining the body before I left.

 nbsp;

The next day, the corpse was gone, and it wasn't the only thing missing: Mr. Blackburn didn't show up for class. The old man never returned to school. No letter of resignation, nothing. The police was eventually called to investigate, but found no traces of him. After an internal investigation, the school discovered that massive amounts of powerful anaesthetic and embalming fluids were missing from the storage room.

 nbsp;

As I passed through the hallway near the Deans office a few days later, I saw a plaque with the pictures of all the schools faculty members. Whoever it was that had been teaching our Biology class for weeks wasn't Mr. Blackburn. No, wrinkly old Mr. Blackburn looked a lot more like what we thought was just a corpse in the back. 




 Well, I'm never listening to the radio again without headphones. 




 Human souls? I have a few of those around. 




 In accordance with the prophecy, I am glad this suggestion pleases you. 




 I never noticed it in my own writing until someone pointed it out. It was then that I began making a conscious effort to eliminate the problem.


You could always do something I read somewhere a long time ago: preface every single sentence with "In accordance with the prophecy.", both in your writing and in real life.


"Hey, Suspense304, what's for dinner?"


"In accordance with the prophecy, baked beans and the tears of lambs." 




 My heart is a flutter with dreams of the butler,

He makes my soul utter words of desire,

Oh how I shutter when I sense him nearer,

The way he helps others, makes me stutter,

I l-l-lo-love y-you, y-you handsome b-butler.


Whats that? N-no. I don-I dont have a massive man-crush on the butler. S-shut up. Its PERFECTLY NORMAL for a man to write a romantic poem for someone else. Shhh. Nothing weird here. Nope. 




 How about getting paid in Timbits? 




 Zoom and enhance!

Wait...there's no need to zoom.

Good god, that is freaky.

The Scarecrow Corpse. It was a good one. Really gave me the chills. 




 The Petitcodiac River, which passes through Moncton New Brunswick, is said to be haunted. The locals refer to it as the Chocolate River, not because of the fancy chocolatier shop on its south bank, but because heavy sediments in the water have turned it a permanent shade of brown. In 1968, a causeway was built in an attempt at controlling the flow of water to prevent flooding in agricultural areas, and to connect Moncton to its neighboring town, Riverview. Up until then, the Chocolate River was home to one of the largest tidal bores on earth, and had an ecosystem rich in marine life. After construction, the river died down to a trickle, and 85% of the creatures died. The locals urged the government to open the causeway doors in order to restore the river to its former glory. It was not until 2010 that the doors were finally open for good. The river began a slow healing process, and marine life gradually returned. Unfortunately, the restoration project came with a little something extra: something sinister joined the wildlife of the chocolate-colored river.

 nbsp;
 
In Fall of 2013, I flew to Moncton to visit my sister for a week. She and I had been best friends since childhood, but our lives had taken us on different paths, and, a few years prior, she moved for work. We kept in touch through video calls and weekly chat sessions. She told me how friendly the people of Moncton were. It was the kind of town where everyone knew you and your relatives by name, even if you had never met. Everyone was polite and lived a nice, quiet life. From my sisters descriptions, an image of a quaint little village formed in my mind. Imagine my surprise when, upon arriving in Moncton, I found a full-blown city. Though un-obscured by skyscrapers, Moncton was full of grocery stores, highways, malls, government and university buildings, etc. It was nothing like what I imaged. I was shocked to see how big Moncton was. My sister picked me up from the airport, and we drove back to her apartment just in time for supper. We spent the evening catching up and geeking out in true sibling fashion.

 nbsp;
 
The next morning, my sister and I headed to her workplace. On the drive there, I spotted the Chocolate River. I expressed interest in checking out the tidal bore: a wave that climbed up a river against its current during high tide. My sister promised we could go the next morning. Having checked out the schedule the previous night, I knew the morning tide was going to come in at around 4:00 am, and had no desire to get up that early. We had no plans for the afternoon, so I asked if we could go watch the evening tidal bore instead, which came in at around 3:00 pm on that particular day. I remember her answer quite vividly, since it took me by surprise. She raised her eyebrows and shook her head quickly: Oh, no. Thats dangerous., she said. I pressed her on the issue, and she explained that there had been a lot of accidents where people had fallen in and drowned. I could not wrap my head around why the city had not built guardrails, or why the morning tide was supposedly safer than the evening tide.

 nbsp;
 
We arrived at my sisters place of employment with two boxes of donuts for her coworkers. After using the sweets to assemble the team, my sister paraded me around and introduced me to everyone. She had not exaggerated when she told me about their hospitality: they were extremely friendly and downright delightful. My sister left me with the group while she took care of some last-minute business. Her coworkers and I got to talking about the tidal bore. An older gentleman with greying hair and a bushy mustache warned me that the river was damned, and that those who watch the tidal bore three nights in a row get dragged under by the living dead, never to be seen or heard from again. He claimed their blood had turned the river brown over the years. At first, I laughed and dismissed it as playful folklore to scare an out-of-towner like me. He had probably told my sister another variation of the story. It was not like her to fall for silly tales, so I was kind enough not to tease her too much for believing in that superstitious nonsense. I banished thoughts of the Chocolate River from my mind and headed back home to play videogames my sister.

 nbsp;
 
By late afternoon on the following day, I asked my sister come with me to see the tidal bore, which took place at around 4:45 pm. She reluctantly agreed to take me, but abandoned me to buy treats at the chocolatier shop not far from where we parked. Careful not to slip on the rocks, I approached the muddy river and took a seat on a stable concrete slab protruding from the landscape. The cool autumn air and the strong breeze made me thankful that I had grabbed my leather jacket on the way out. My hands searched through its pockets until my fingers caught my cellphone. I checked the schedule, and smiled in anticipation: the tidal bore was going to come in any minute now. I waited patiently, head arched towards the end of the river, until I saw a wave on the horizon. As the water approached, I began hearing a dreadful sound. Some person or creature was groaning. I averted my gaze from the water for just a second to see what was making the noise. By the time I turned my head back, I felt a splash of cold, mucky water flooding my shoes. An audible yelp escaped my lips and I jumped to higher ground. I did not expect the river to swell quite that much. The wave continued its journey up the stream, taking the moaning sound away with it, and the water eventually evened out.

 nbsp;

That night, I did a bit of research on the Chocolate River. There had been no less than 9 cases of mysterious deaths and disappearances since the causeway doors had opened three years prior. Two of the victims were part of a camera crew getting preliminary shots for a documentary on the restoration of the Chocolate River. Their equipment washed up on shore several weeks later, so it was assumed they had drowned and that the river had fed their bodies into the Atlantic Ocean. Another case talked about a young photographer. A piece of his shirt, clinging to a boulder on the banks of the river, was all they ever found of him. Authorities speculated that the man, trying to get a nice photo, had slipped and fallen in. I remembered being taken by surprise by the volume of water that suddenly reached me when the tide came in, so I could understand how a couple of accidents might have happened. As I read through the articles, I began to paint an entirely different picture in my mind. There were only so many alleged suicides and accidents that could happen before it raised a couple questions, and I was shocked the authorities had done nothing about it.

 nbsp;

The next day, we drove to Hopewell Rocks, which was the meeting point between the Atlantic Ocean and the Chocolate River. Hopewell Rocks had almost made it on the list of 7 Natural Wonders of the World. I was enthralled by the beautiful landscape of massive water-eroded boulders. It was impressive to see the natural marks that perfectly outlined just how high the water could go. You could see sediments and rows of kelp clinging to the stones. I was standing under one of the boulders for a photo, and looked up to see that the water reached at least 5 feet over me during high tide. That was probably how the handprints had gotten up there. I noticed them around the highest edges of some of the larger boulders. They resembled ancient cave paintings, in that they were simple and lacked the kind of profanity you would expect from regular graffiti. I explored the beach in complete awe, examining every cavernous nook and cranny along the way.

 nbsp;

We got back in time for the next evening tide, which took place around 6:00 pm. This time, my sister joined me. I had packed us a couple sandwiches, which we ate while waiting for the show. I had chosen a spot on higher ground to avoid my running shoes getting flooded again. The first time was unpleasant enough. As time went on, the streets around us emptied and the sounds of the city faded away. It was not long before we began hearing strange noises. A chorus of agonized screams, howls, and groans erupted from every direction as the tide approached. I could see fear in my sisters eyes as she pointed towards the river. I followed her gaze, spotting dark shapes underneath the surface. Just like the ocean flooded the river, fear flooded every inch of me. I would have stayed frozen there, had my sister not grabbed me by the arm and pulled me to the car. I could still see something under the water as we drove over the causeway.

 nbsp;

On the third night, I returned to the Chocolate River alone: my sister was still freaked out about what we had seen and heard the night before. I got to the river early, and watched the sun slowly crawl towards the horizon, giving me very little light to observe the tide. It was due to come around 7:00 pm, but I did not let the lack of light deter me. I cautiously approached the river, sat down, and waited until I saw the vague outline of a wave in the distance. Again, moans and screams filled the air, this time louder than ever. I could see something sticking out of the wave as it rolled towards me. One by one, hundreds of muddied fingers reached through the waters surface. I only had time to see the fingers turning into hands before I remembered what that man had told me: the undead would drag me under if I watched the tidal bore three nights in a row. I pounced to my feet and staggered towards the car as quickly as my legs could take me. My foot hit a crack in the concrete and my ankle twisted harshly. The pain brought me to my knees, but when I turned around, I could see fingers reaching over the riverbank, and I forced myself back to my injured feet. I ran to the car, throwing the door open and slamming it shut in one rapid motion. I turned the car on and the headlights illuminated the river: I could see arms reaching over the edge. Tires shrieking, I high-tailed it out of there.

I did not go back to the Chocolate River after that night. I spent what was left of the week in sisters apartment, trying hard to forget what I saw. On the plane home, I looked outside the window and saw the Chocolate River below. I swear, even from a distance I could see shadows under the surface. I cant help wondering: did the dead start inhabiting the river after the causeway doors opened, or was the causeway built to keep them out? 




 Too busy laughing about the beaver comment to come up with a good comeback. 




 The only pointy branches are the ones around my heart whenever you're away. ; D 




 *Sigh* How am I supposed to compete with that? You win, good sir. May your serious and meaningful long-term relationships with consensual ladyfolk be most fruitful. I can only hope that I will be as virile as you one day. 




 Can't say that I have, alcohol's not my thing.

But for you ladies out there: I have chugged an entire bottle of water once, without taking a breath. That's right, badass alert. 




 My Canadar alarms are blaring. Let us do a celebratory shot of maple syrup, my faithful companion. 




 I'd try replacing the photos with people you really don't like and see what happens. Maybe you can save your loved ones that way? 




 Have a happy and spooky New Year everyone! 




 You could switch to the lighter color scheme so that, on your next visit, you won't immediately know where you are. 




 The one about my car. 




 Read Roman numerals and read analogue clocks. It's ironic, because I have a beautiful grandfather clock with Roman numerals on it. I have no idea whether or not the time on it is accurate. 




 I agree: I got a 100$ bill once. Took me forever to get rid of it. 




 Everything is so black and white with this guy. 




 There's nothing wrong with implementing chunks of yourself in your stories: it helps breathe life into them. You shouldn't shy away from it. Besides, no one's going to know that you're using yourself in your story...unless it's someone who knows you out there in the 'real' world. 




 I half agree with you. I don't have a problem with people playing along per se, and I find some of the comments really entertaining, but I think two of the rules come into conflict with one another in such a way as to be really detrimental.

People have to **assume everything is real** and play along, but **people can't ask for proof**. If everything is real, then of course they're going to want proof. I wrote a story a few days ago about something caught on camera and a bunch of people asked for the video, which is only natural because the story is supposed to be real. I know they're not -supposed- to ask for the video, but they did, and I'm not a video-y person, so I provided no video footage.

I think it would be a step in the right direction to let people play around if they want to, but not FORCE them to assume everything is real if they don't. 




 I'm glad the story scared you! In the interest of being mysterious...ONE of the stories I have posted is 100% true. The rest are works of fiction.

The reader in me says: Heck yeah, the writers here impress me tremendously.

 Last year, on Boxing Day, I found a really cool ornament in a clearance box. It had a built-in camera to record a unique perspective on your holiday celebrations. I grabbed the last one from the stores dusty shelf and brought it home for less than 10 bucks. I forgot about it until my wife, my two daughters, and I decorated the house earlier this month. I told my daughters about the camera and said wed secretly catch Santa in the act. I had an old costume in the attic and intended to deliver some gifts in full view of the camera on Christmas night. My girls were overjoyed, and went back-and-forth trying to find the best place to put the ornament on the tree. They had no idea daddy re-positioned it later so it could actually catch the living room and a good angle.

 nbsp;

In the nights leading up to Christmas, I turned the camera on to make sure everything was working properly. In the morning, I previewed the footage---just long enough to confirm the thing was working. Satisfied, I inserted the Micro SD card back into the ornament, and slipped in a new battery in anticipation for the big night. Daddy didn't want to disappoint his girls with a failed recording.

 nbsp;

We enjoyed Christmas Eve as a family, playing board games and eating way more junk food than there was room in our stomachs. Like we do every year, we let our daughters open one gift from mommy and daddy before going to bed. The girls, still riding their sugar-high, could be heard giggling in their bedrooms from all the way up the stairs. From time to time, my wife and I could hear one of them shush the other, claiming shed heard hoofs on the roof or bells jingling. Eventually, our kiddos dosed off. My wife kissed me on the cheek and headed to bed while I turned off all the lights. I retrieved the costume and tiptoed to the living room, getting ready for my big feature film debut.

 nbsp;

I did everything you would expect Santa to do: I ate most of the cookies, I drank the milk, I pet my large stomach and said my HO HO HOs, and I dropped a few presents by the fireplace, all in full-view of the camera. A pretty good acting job, if I do say so myself.

 nbsp;

On Christmas morning, the girls came running into our bedroom to wake us up. They excitedly insisted we watch the video before opening the presents. I transferred the footage to my laptop, forwarded to where Santa showed up, and pressed play. My girls squealed with delight and jumped in front of the screen, frantically waving at Santa while obscuring the video from my view. It brought me so much joy to see how happy the girls were. I was too lazy to stop the video, so it continued to play in the background while we unwrapped out gifts. I spotted a box I had not seen the night before: it was a small and wrapped in a blue foil paper I did not recognize. My name was on it, but my wife seemed as surprised as I was to see it there. Noticing my confusion, my youngest daughter spoke:

 nbsp;

Daddy! Thats gotta be from Mr. Elf!, she said, her voice cheerful and bright.

 nbsp;

I was ready to dismiss her elf comment as just another weird thing kids say, but my wife wasn't so quick to ignore it.

 nbsp;

Honey, what elf?, she asked.

 nbsp;

My daughter pointed to the laptop. By then, the video had ended and all that was left on the screen was a preview of the first frame.

 nbsp;

The one that came with Santa!, she answered.

 nbsp;

Panic struck me like a bird in a jet propeller. I know my wife didnt dress up as an elf. I scanned the video, clicking forward and back until I saw what my daughter had seen: there was someone in the living room. He walked into the corner after I had turned the lights off. He stood there watching me parading around as Santa. The video went completely quiet after that. It was as though the camera failed to record a single sound. The strange, tall man in an elf costume stood perfectly still for over an hour, watching the camera from a distance. After a while, he walked over to the plate of cookies and bit the head off a gingerbread man. I glanced at the plate and saw his teeth mark on the decapitated cookie. The man then quietly approached the Christmas tree. I thought the audio wasn't working, but as he reached the tree, I began hearing his slow and steady breaths. He reached towards the ornament, and the video stopped.

 nbsp;

In a terrified frenzy, I grabbed the blue box hed left behind. I ripped the bow off of it and tossed the frilly thing away. I frantically removed the wrapping paper, opened the box, and looked inside. There, on a bed of bubble wrap, was the battery Id put in the camera the night before. My wife took the ornament and opened the back: the battery was missing. I dont know what scares me more: what the camera caught, or what the elf might have done after he turned off the camera. 




 As someone who has a 3DS, I find this unsettling. I think I'm going to keep a closer eye on who walks into my plaza from now on. 




 That chameleon is great, and that stamp is awesome!

My sister got me an alarm clock that imitates the sunrise. It's pretty dark in my room, so this'll make mornings a lot more cheerful. My current alarm clock is so old it actually has a cassette tape player integrated into it.

My parental units got me a bunch of cool stuff for my kitchen (including a potato ricer) and some DCU movies. Can't wait to watch Justice League: War with my sister. Never too old for Justice League! 




 Happy insert holiday here to you, too! :)
