 Some films or TV shows. I remember watching Juno a few years back and crying at the end; I don't even remember why. The worst part was I'd already been laughed at by my mum for crying at the end of Breakfast at Tiffanys (who leaves a cat out in the rain like that?). 




 Community.  




 Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons for the daily reminders now about payment but want to make sure we can all get along to Newcastle in one piece of paper and I have been together just over a year ago. 




 How have I never noticed that?? I really need to hit up IMDB more often.  




 My NSis and NMum do the same. They keep calling FH by his university nickname - he graduated in 2012. He's told them before he'd rather go by his actual name but "That's what he was introduced as so that's what he's getting called."  




 They're the worst, at least bees have a purpose. I actually passed that exam which was amazing considering the panic attack I had following Waspgate.
