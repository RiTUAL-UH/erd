 Your username leads me to believe this story might not be truthful...

 Was it an archeology class by chance?  




 Did your parents not hug you enough growing up? 




 That most of the people in the Reddit community were intelligent, contributing members of society. Some of you should never procreate. This topic has me in stitches...(just to clarify- that means I am laughing uncontrollably haha) 




 I always thought it would be really cool if they rebooted the series with a new Entourage. It could center around a young, upcoming rapper and his entourage. It could have some of the same players (Ari Gold, Billy Walsh, etc) but have a fresh new feeling to it with an all-new cast of characters. I would have loved to see something like that. 




 Maybe a 5 or a 6, I just have seen every episode and picked up on it part of the way through reading your well-written post. Funny stuff.

 Even before reading this article, I found this ass clown to be one of the most despicable, entitled losers in Hollywood. This just confirms his douchiness for me. Suck it LaDouche.

 A dolphin. No known predators, extremely smart, fast and are one of the only other mammals that have sex for fun. 




 Your son has a fiery temper! 




 Led Zeppelin's "Rock and Roll" was used in a Cadillac commercial and it's just not the same anymore. 




 There would be nothing funny about me seeing those clowns, because I would be sitting in a pile of crap. The poop would definitely be of the nervous variety. 




 Haha I was only kidding. No hard feelings. 




 That is tragic. Sorry for your loss. 




 Sorry for your loss 




 I just threw up in my mouth 




 I was at a party in college drinking and having a good time when a few kids came over that were looking for some trouble. We were out on the front lawn asking their group to move onto the next party and stop causing trouble and they were getting more and more riled up. My buddy put his hand onto one of them to ask them to move down the block when another kid suckerpunched my friend and knocked him out. He immediately took off running, as we gave chase, and he started to run across the street. Right as my buddy grabbed the back of his shirt, the kid got plowed into by a car.

It was a grisly scene. The kid was hit so hard that he went through the car window. He was slumped over the steering wheel of the car and the driver was sitting there motionless with a look I will never forget. The kid's leg was backward and his bone was sticking out of his leg. He was unconscious for a while and we called the cops to send an ambulance as quickly as possible. He woke up after a while and started screaming in pain and trying to pull himself out of the windshield. He was cutting his hands up real bad and a few of us had to restrain him from hurting himself any further.

Several cops, ambulances, and firetrucks showed up and eventually he was removed from the windshield and taken to the hospital. The car was going 32 MPH according to the police after they measured the skid marks from the car's brakes. The dean of student affairs interviewed me a few times about what happened and told me that the kid had numerous broken bones including the compound fracture of his leg, internal bleeding, a major concussion and needed over 400 stitches. My buddy that grabbed his shirt had to get glass removed from his hand and needed several stitches. The good news is that the kid recovered and returned to school after a few months. I will never forget the whole experience, it was such an intense situation. In a flash of time, a kid's life could have ended, but he luckily was spared. We were obviously pissed at the kid for hitting my friend, but I would never wish that on anyone.

TL;DR: A kid suckerpunched my friend, ran into the street and got hit by a car and ended up halfway through a windshield of a car with terrible injuries.
 




 You laughed? I literally would have shit my pants...
