 Perhaps I just had a shitty therapist, but all I ever got from it was "you have a chemical imbalance in your brain, sucks, don't it?" Therapy just made me focus more on the stupid things, trying to figure out why they bother me. It ended up making me feel super self-absorbed, to the point that my very best friend told me to either change or get out of her life.

I worry less about what other people currently think, but rather what they may do if I pursue a certain want. 

I suppose my biggest concern with this philosophy is that it seems like it just makes us all into selfish little twats. All I want to do is help people less fortunate than I, but I get so caught up in how I might be hurting them that I just assume that everyone is better off without me. I know it's not true, but that little voice is constantly telling me I'm a burden or a bother. I've been getting better at pushing it aside, but sometimes I just can't see the point, if it's just going to come back.

Tl;dr: maybe I just can't not give fucks, when my ultimate goal is to help others. 




 I've been lurking on this sub for a while now. Every post is full of "your problems don't matter" or "just do it" or "be confident."

It isn't that easy. Anxiety is part of my identity. It's like telling someone with clinical depression to "just be happy." It's pointless, and a little bit offensive. I checked the sidebar, and in the "how to start not giving a fuck" post, literally all of them seem like completely insurmountable goals. How do you go from not knowing what self-confidence feels like to being super confident all the time?

I'd love to take your advice. But it's like telling rabbits to stop fucking and pooping. 




 That is my issue with this whole sub. I know I shouldn't give a fuck, but then I just get hung up on doing that. At least for me, not worrying about things takes away one of the only constants of my identity.  




 And if you can't control your own basic bodily functions, there's no way in hell you can consent, no matter how much you want it. 




 So you might fit into a 32" and a 34", depending on the store. That still seems more reasonable than fitting into a 2 one place and a 9 somewhere else. 




 I can see where they're coming from. I live in Southern Indiana, aka meth land, and knew a handful of kids who cooked in high school. It's an awful drug, and those hooked on it will do anything to get/make more.

That being said, I think this is a little extreme. You can still go buy Sudophed (sp?), just not boxes and boxes. Maybe putting a cap on the amount you can buy at a time would work better. 




 Dissociatives are not fun (in my opinion). Instead of passing out, expect to be having conversations with the giant spider on the wall or freaking out cuz you can't find your bread.

Edit: also, a benadryl overdose is serious business. Seizures, vomiting, coma, etc. Source: I took an od of it on purpose and am literally the only person who's been in my hospital for one, had seizures, and didn't die. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but don't fuck with this stuff. 




 They may be driven to have it cuz it feels good, but that isn't the reason. It's a biological imperative that happens to feel good. If it didn't, horses would go extinct pretty quick. 




 Yes, it does. When I make potent cookies, it makes the place smell like grandma and dank. Not safe to do until you've got your own place. 




 I had a buddy who turned it into a game: take a standard drink each time they say standard drink. Have fun ;-) 














 I'm not sure about him, but I (also from the midwest) could find a zip anywhere between $275-$315. 




 I decide what I want to make beforehand, and then get so excited at the prospect of fresh pastries. It's also been a bit of a zen activity for me for years.

The dough for these takes about six hours, so there's a lot of down time to get more stoned or watch some Netflix.  




 For the dough I just used Julia Child's croissant recipe. For the filling, I put some berries, sugar, flour, and lemon juice in a saucepan and let it cook and thicken over low heat while I rolled out and cut the dough. Use water around the edged to seal. Sorry I couldn't give a legit recipe, I usually just wing it.

 Madame. Madam is the head of a brothel.  









 Julia Child. I'm not sure which one has the most pastries, but french pastries are my schtick. 









 This is the best advice on this topic I've ever heard.

OP, everyone has to deal with relationships that just aren't right. And it hurts, because unless you're a sociopath, it really sucks to hurt someone else. I had a terrible, controlling, legitimately insane SO for a while. I loved him more than I could possibly say. I still do, even just for the good memories we made together. But we just weren't good together. "test_subject2886, shut up, you're about to say something you know nothing about" was a common thread. When I finally realized it wasn't working out, I agonized over the decision for weeks. I felt guilty for months afterward.

I've now been away from him for a year, and it was the best decision I've ever made. No one deserves a shitty relationship, but they help us figure out better what we need for a healthy, thriving one. So buy yourself some Ben Jerry's and remember that you've gotten through this frog, so you know you can do it again if you have to.

Tl;dr: we all have to deal with bad relationships so we can figure out what we need. 




 Sounds similar to my best Goodwill find: a vintage suede fringe jacket for $10. Looked up the tags online, turns out it's worth at least $300. I live for deals like this. 




 If you work it, as you clearly have been. Congrats!

Apparently. 




 The other discussion is more relevant and informative, but from my experience this isn't necessary. I've never had a UTI, and I never make it a priority to pee right after sex. 




 Make sure to eat a lot of yogurt or other things with probiotics to prevent a yeast infection. The antibiotics for the UTI can mess with the levels of bacteria and yeast in the vagina, which can in turn create a yeast infection. Vagina problems are the worst. 









 That pretty perfectly describes how I am when I don't smoke weed. Clearly ymmv. 




 I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and panic attacks on the regular. I am generally worried about something all the time. I smoke a spliff every morning when I wake up to calm myself down. Sometimes I get paranoid, but it only ever has to do with avoiding getting arrested. I have never had a panic attack while stoned. Just my two cents. 




 And a decent amount of them probably do, too. 




 That's my protocol as well. Also I don't ever seriously consider stupid tattoos. 




 Some places just don't have schwag. I can't even find mids in my town, and I've got several dealer friends. 




 My buddy once said "Look what the cat blew in." Now we use that regularly. 




 I think they're beautiful, but I just filed mine into a similar shape, but much shorter. I remember I posted them on here and someone told me "black always looks good," I'm guessing because they thought the shape looked bad. I say do whatever you like! I always feel ten times classier with my nails not square. 




 A good friend of mine started taekwondo this year and loved it. I got my lifeguard certification renewed last semester, too. 














 I always have the problem of the polish sliding right off my nail after I take it out of the water. I don't understand the magic. 




 It's called the Little Five-Hundred 




 We just girling out after quite a few whiskey shots nights. 









 Holy shit, I know you! 




 Trevor, Sam, and Darren had some shows this weekend, so a friend and I went. We wanted to smoke with them but  couldn't work up the nerve to ask. 




 Or it didn't. Looked like it did. 









 Sponge, just got a giant bag of makeup sponges at Walmart for less than 2 bucks.

 I think it's actually a puke joke. Even worse. But it's my personal favorite polish, too bad I can't find any place to buy it.

 Where do I apply? 




 So, long story short, I make really idiotic decisions when it comes to boys.

I got played like a card by this guy for six months and all I have to show for it is a diagnosis of major depressive disorder and a short hospital stay. I decided it was a great idea to Facebook stalk him for a little bit tonight, and I ended up bawling my eyes out, just like every time I see or think about him too much.

I know that drinking my problems away will be bad in the long run, but tonight I'm killing what's left of a fifth of Captain and realizing that his new girlfriend is probably smart and funny and everything I'm not, but still holding onto the fact that she makes Sarah Jessica Parker look like she doesn't have a horsr face.

Tl;dr: fuck boys, fuck Facebook, and fuck ugly bitches. 




 AKA a terrible movie with hardly any plot glamorizing the very very young woman who fucked over most of the French population of the late 18th century. 




 I have to separate them, they curl in on each other and I end up with polish all over the place otherwise. 




 What is that green, I love it! 




 AKA I didn't have anything to separate my toes, so I used a pen, a nail file, and a lip balm. Color is CG Ingrid. 














 Classin' it up! I'm right there with you. 




 Juice of any kind, but I love Apple or Orange. 









 I'm going to give an opinion right now that I know is incredibly unpopular in this subreddit, because it's worked for me many a time.

I enjoy faking orgasms. I am a fairly orgasmic person, though. Usually what happens is that I'll be able to tell that a guy is about to come, and I start contracting my muscles. Doing that (depending on the position) also forces my hips into a position where my clit is getting stimulation, and seeing the guy feeling me get close usually sends me over into a real orgasm.

I have completely faked them during random hookups when I just knew that it wasn't going to go anywhere, and I don't find a problem with that. If you don't care for the person, an you know he won't be inside you again, you can do whatever you want, because the next person he sleeps with will be different from you and he'll have to learn how to please her specifically. 




 Hello all!

Today I splurged a finally got myself a bottle of Seche Vite. I used it straightaway but have a few questions. I searched and a few questions were resolved, but these ones I couldn't find answers to.

I didn't run into this today, but if I need two coats of a polish to get it opaque, do I need to let the separate layers dry before putting on the next coat, or should I do them all quickly and then seche on top while they're all still tacky? I don't mean between base color and art, that question has been resolved time and time again, I mean with light colors that require more than one coat to be opaque.

Secondly, how thick is a "thick coat" of SV? I figured it meant pretty think, but I got bubbles in it today. I know it isn't from the polish underneath, because I didn't see the bubbles while I was waiting for the polish to go from really wet to slightly tacky.

Thank you all so much! This stuff really is magical. 




 Maybe something to do with Doc Counsilman, the IU swimming coach back in the day who practically invented kinesiology as it relates to sport training? Only thing I can think of, considering we're practically landlocked (being from the Southern half of the state, I sometimes forget that Lake Michigan even exists).

 My friend just got Razzle Me Dazzle Me and Bling it On, both of which are amazing. She let me borrow Razzle Me Dazzle Me, and let me tell you it looks amazing over a dark grey, and even better matte. 




 Now, I may be misreading the signals, but they have feelings for each other right? 




 I go to the comments to see an explanation of why it works. Then I feel worse because it loses the magic. 




 Bitch, you can see the label. Oliver Soft Red, representing Southern Indiana!

 Beautiful. Want. 




 I'm not vegan, but that sounds fantastic! Applesauce is a really good egg substitute. So are bananas  




 Aw, man. Syllabus week was last week for me, and I am still drunk as fuck on a Wednesday. Clearly your schedule isn't made right. I don't have class until 1 tomorrow, and that's the earliest I start. 




 My first mistake after I turned 19 was having sex with a sociopath who shared the birthday. I mean, neither of us would have had birthday sex otherwise, but it was a bad move on my part. So trust me, it could have been way worse. I had to make eye contact with the kid in order to pass him bowls after that. 




 At a store just off campus from my (dry) campus has a shirt that says "Dry Campus My A**" I plan on buying one as soon as I have enough money for my booze and some left over. Because it's so so true. 




 I won't downvote you for going to Purdue, even though it may be my duty as an IU student. But all those points are good, especially if you're an attractive female. However, since you're 21 in time, I highly suggest you make the 2.5 hour trek down here for Little 5. I can't fucking wait for my first Little 5 once I turn 21. 




 Also, I definitely turned this over for the picture and poured a little bit of vodka that hadn't evaporated from my last shot on my keyboard. Still seems to work fine. 









 Thanks. Although, your username makes me a little nervous, considering I am far from a furry. But, I do't judge, whatever you like is cool by me, as long as you don't try to force me to comply. 




 As someone who goes to college in their hometown (townies FTW!), I just ask my parents to let me have the car for a few hours as I load all my shit into four loads max in order to move back after the breaks. My roommate is totally cool with the level of messiness I deal with, for her half to the room is almost as bad. 




 We're working on it, don't worry. 




 They are always wonderful. My roommate let me take some of hers in return for a few shots of my vodka. 




 I'm not sure how to take this comment. A compliment? A thing to worry about in case my parents Reddit? I don't even know. 




 It looks wonderful! And your nails are beautiful! I could never get mine to grow that long without breaking them. 









 Not OP, but I tend to do a much better job on my legs if I'm a little tipsy. Forces you to concentrate more and go slower. 




 Caramel Apple drinks. One shot green apple schnapps, one shot butterscotch schnapps, two or three shots Maker's Mark. They taste so fantastic that you forget that you'll get wasted. I usually forget after three of these, because I also will just take whiskey shots, too. 




 Or putting tampons right next to the ice cream. Gets me every time. 




 To me that looks like a bad time in a bottle. But good on you for being able to handle it.

 Also, I'm saving the fuck out of this post. Also also, each of my presidential cocktail nights must be accompanied with music from the particular period of time when each one served. 




 As a political science major, it bothered me a little bit that the article says "George H. Bush," not "George H. W. Bush." But also as a political science major, I'm really happy that this article even exists. I need to drink my way through the presidents as soon as possible. 




 Hair of the dog that bit you.

 Totally random, but fuck beer pong: flippy cup is my shit! I'm terrible at beer pong, but everyone I know wants me on their flippy cup team. 




 Looks like my fridge, only it's soup I've got surrounded. 




 After more than 5 really long sob-story drunk texts to the same person, I just took his number out of my phone. Pretty much the best decision I ever made. 




 Even as a lady who was born as such, I love getting baked and doing housework in a dress and heels. I think (at least for me) it's the 50's housewife aesthetic. 




 Any one of my multitude of cute sweaters and a hot cup of coffee or tea. 




 Can you feel the cornstarch, or does it just thicken? I'm weird and can't stand the way cornstarch feels on my skin. 




 Not a lot with the lips. I'd just go for maybe a slightly pink tinted gloss. 




 I'm a big fan of waking up, checking my phone, and sending "Sorry about that, man. I was really drunk." Because calling someone man means it's just friends, right? Or maybe that's just cuz I'm a chick. 




 As a Packers fan who hails from Indiana, I am very jealous that you got to be there at all. Upvote for winning dat game, though.

EDIT: Also, since my whole family is from Wisconsin, I understand the special kind of drunk y'all get up there. I hope to be able to drink beer in Milwaukee with everyone there sometime fairly soon. I feel as though this crazy alcohol tolerance is in my Wisconsin blood. 




 I know that feel, boy. I've had 8 shots of whiskey in the last 5 hours and should have been so fucked up that I'd pass out at 3pm. Alcohol tolerances fucking suck. Take a shot to that, I guess.
