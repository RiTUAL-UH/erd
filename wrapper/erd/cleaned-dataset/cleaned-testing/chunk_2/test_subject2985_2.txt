 I really hate when people give these insignificant morons the attention that they seek by doing and saying awful things. If you detest them, don't give them what they want. Ignore them. 




 This is why I question Blizzard's explanation of poor matchmaking being due to a small player base. Everyone I know that wants to play, can play. The game has pretty much been semi-launched for a while now, and I don't see much changing with launch.

I hope I'm wrong. 




 Contact your representatives and voice support for the measure. Be prepared to say why, as they will most likely ask.

And spread the word. 




 What's next? Handing out seat belts in schools!? 




 Working as intended. 




  They absolutely are not "against" bc.

Not sure about that. They frequently promote "abstinence only" policies.

 They're against public funding for it.

That's true enough, though why it's preferable to pay significantly more for the costs of unwanted pregnancies, rather than paying much less to prevent them, is beyond me.

I'm pretty liberal, though, so paying $X for social policies to prevent $6X in long-term costs is right up my alley. 




  abortions were down 40%

The "pro-life" party in action. 




 I think Jaina is the hero that has the most variability. I feel I'm making a choice at every level, which is fantastic. For most heroes, I have a set build that doesn't change, or if it's only one or two talents that might change situationally. Some heroes I have two builds that are like that.

Jaina is the only one that I play where everything is in flux at almost every level, and I love that about her. Almost all of her talents feel viable and useful, and very few of them stand out as the "correct" choice for every situation. 




 Yeah, probably. But likely lower than if we fail to adequately address climate change. 




 I guess is that they'll be closer to actual prices, given that we subsidize fossil fuels rather heavily. 




 Oh, ha. I never take that talent. Thanks for pointing that out. 




 I might care, if I didn't buy my current Moto X on the promise that it would get fast updates, and am approaching 6 months of waiting for the last update.

Probably going Samsung on my next phone. 




 Here are the ones that I've come up with off the top of my head:

* A Starcraft non-combat support unit like an overlord, raven, arbiter, etc., that has no actual combat abilities, just provides information, buffs, and infrastructure.
* A starcraft builder, like a probe that literally just builds things.
* Ragnaros - literally can't leave the base as he has to inhabit a building at all times. 




  Well, my advice for every gaming site is to copy Rock Paper Shotgun to the letter. They are the only ones I know that are doing it right.

What are you referencing here? What is it that they do that you like? I'm not familiar with them and nothing really stood out as I dug around a bit. 




 Yup. Me too.

TL;DR - Me too. 




 Kinda defeats the point... 




 Grats!

How do you deal with really bad teams? 




 Agreed. Very sad to see that his trait is still not being addressed. 




  He needs a trait

FTFY 




  Leave it to PolitiFact to find a way to rate a completely true statement "mostly false".

It's technically true, but certainly not actually true. You really don't see the distinction? 




 [Wouldn't it be great if you had more than two choices?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w) 




 You'd hardly be the first, but by all means. 




 What have they distorted? 




 You eat all the cookies. Your mom asks if you ate all the cookies. You say no, because there are billions of cookies still in the world that you did not eat.

Just because what you said was technically true does not mean that you did not lie. 




 You really don't see a problem with distortions of the truth? 




 Don't forget religious freedom. 




 Sgt.Hammer decides to go mines alone.

Hammer's wrong.

Sgt Hammer entered siege mode and died almost instantly.

Hammer's wrong.

she rages

Hammer's wrong. 




 Fair enough, though I wouldn't really call confirming something that he said an attack. 




 Not sure anything is worse than free Hammer week. "Don't worry, guys. I'm sieged!" 




 I feel sorry for people who feel the need to rub it in whenever they have a good move or victory. Why isn't winning enough? 




  Sure, you will get some buildings down before you die but I doubt you will reach a fort this way.

I do it all the time.

Don't get me wrong, I think the team should be there to support the terror, but even if they aren't, I think it can still be very effective. 




 You can do a lot of damage with the terror, even if the enemy is responding. You just need to bounce between forts and try and maximize your W. You might not get a fort, especially if *your* team is ignoring you (which is a pretty big mistake), but you'll still make them feel it. And if your team does show up, you'll really do some significant damage. A fort at least. 




 You mean checking the facts of politicians? I agree. 




 I'm not sure I agree. A well-used terror can easily get 2-3 forts. That's massive. If the other team is ignoring my terror and it results in a 4v5, I think it's on my team to simply play safely while I absolutely wreck the opposing team.

The only times that I think it's all that appropriate to fight as the terror are:

1. If you're near enough to a kill/fight that you can secure it without sinking too much time into it.
2. If you're in desperate need of defense.

Perhaps I'm wrong, but in my experience, you want the terror pushing, especially if the other team is letting you do it. 




 inform themselves of optimal strategies

Agreed, but I think it's worth pointing out that this is not a case of a "non-optimal strategy" so much as it's a "rather significant mistake". 




 Hearthstone crawls. It goes months, often many months, without an update. 




  Also dislike having it select according to team composition, though i can understand and respect that change

I feel the same way. It's pretty much just a "random support" button. But it's better than the alternative. 




 I'd really like to see Mephisto, Baal, Maltheal, or any of the members of the Angiris council. 




 I've updated them many times over the last year. I try and stay current. 




 Zagara is incredibly strong. She dishes out insane amounts of damage from far away and has the ability to zone enemies out very effectively. She almost always dominates her lane, can hold her own in many 1v1 situations (though it's usually a game of chicken), and she's awesome to have in a team fight, especially, though not exclusively, thanks to the incredible power of maw.

Her only serious weakness is her lack of an escape before 20, and you can compensate for that with creep by keeping your route to safety covered and using it to see threats early enough to run.

TL;DR - Zagara is always awesome, just be prepared and informed well enough to run in time, while murdering anything and everything that you don't like (for the swarm, of course). 




  Lv7 Death Touch: A noob trap talent, you should never take this. Frozen Tempest already provides enough damage to kill minions. 

Reminds me of Possession. 




 This is a good idea for Blizzard, because personally speaking, I would never, ever buy anything requiring a timed commitment like that. It would seriously piss me off if I bought a stimpack and then got slammed with work and couldn't use it or something.

If it was based on actual game time or game count, I'd actually consider buying one, but the current form is definitely not an option. 




 Something I ask myself every time I see things like one team having two tanks and no supports, and the other team having two supports and no tanks. Could ya maybe have just... 




 Do many vikings players really soak 3 lanes? Unless it's during an objective, I don't see much purpose to this. I typically put Olaf in a solo lane and keep Baelog and Erik together. As long as you have at least one other person soaking the third lane, you're not gaining anything by putting a viking in it, and you're giving up attention, viking safety, and some pushing ability.

What's the point of having vikings in all 3 lanes? 




 Great save! 




 He's referring to sites like politifact, that attempt to confirm or disprove what politicans say. 




 I disagree. AC could be a 4/3 today and still wouldn't see much play, if any.

OP didn't ask about today. He asked about when I started playing. 




 8-mana mind control.

 You're not considering the fact that because self driving cars will be much safer, they'll be able to drive a lot faster. So if it's truly a matter of time and patience, you're a lot better off taking those 2 minutes to set up your destination, because you're probably going to get there 30% sooner if you let the car drive.

Also, as has been stated, the state of technology is such that your phone likely knows where you're about to go before you do. So 2 minutes is likely over estimated by about 2 minutes. 




 Looks slick. Wish the gif were a little larger so I could see it better.

Great work! 




  tl;dr: the driver must pay attention at all times to avoid anything the car can't.

Maybe, but not necessarily. Google has recently adopted the stance that a human driver is not a reliable backup for an automated car. A person trying to correct the car's decision making would likely cause more issues than they would prevent.

Of course, we're in very uncharted territory, so we'll see if that pans out or not. 




 It's not a stupid question at all. It's one that is frequently asked, as a matter of fact.

The short answer is yes, it's very possible, and it's something the industry is going to have to account for. 




 I mean after this guy has called for a recorded vote. For example:

17 representatives in the room, Boehner says it's 218, guy runs in and asks for a recorded vote, they count and record a vote, and it's now very clear that there were nowhere near 218. Why hasn't Boehner committed a crime by saying there was? That rule exists for a reason, and he has very obviously broken it. 




 If this angers you, why give them free publicity? They publish outrageous and crazy things to get people's attention, and clearly it's worked on you. 




 Serious question: when Boehner declares a quorum of 218 congressmen, and then the actual count commences and then it is proved that there are like 30 congressmen there, why doesn't Boehner go to jail? Is that not a blatant and undeniable example of fraud and abuse?

And are the records of these obviously false quorums publicly available? I'd love to see what he's tried to get away with. 




  The people in power are afraid it could actually pass

Just the republicans. The democrats voted in favor of legalization. 




 List them? 




  I always thought they were FOR personal freedoms, am I just mistaken?

You are mistaken. 




 The "party of small government" strikes again. 




 The "party of small government" strikes again. 




 That's a lot of black arrows.

 Beats me. I just play the game. 




 He's super fun and very effective. I don't think he's considered a top-tier hero, but I certainly enjoy playing him. 




 I've had to forfeit several winning games because of this, now that the game is available on mobile. It's my own fault for trying to squeeze in very fast games, but it still sucks. 




 Impressive. Great work! 




 Clever. I like it. 




 Many, even those of us with relatively high end machines, suffer from periods of lower frame rates (30), stutters, etc.. The hope has always been that the game hasn't been optimized yet, and that it would be before launch. 




 What do we think the difference between "open beta" and "launched" will be? 




 As long as you're actually going to monetize it. If it's just going to sit in a repo and die, you might as well let open source it. Otherwise your work is just going to waste.

Looks fantastic, BTW. Would love to hear how you did it. 




 Looks great! Nice job.  




 Thank you. Is totally confused.  




 Sure, here are several key points.

1. Prohibition doesn't work. People that want pot can get pot, and all we're doing is denying ourselves the opportunity to tax and regulate it. It's the exact same thing that happened during alcohol prohibition. In fact, many kids choose pot over beer because it's easier to get.
2. We're taking money and jobs out of the legitimate economy, and giving it directly to gangs, drug dealers, and ultra violent cartels, who, along with marijuana, deal in harder drugs, weapons, and slaves (and who knows what else). To say nothing of the massive tax revenue, and the fact that we're packing for-profit prisons
3. Marijuana is very likely a gateway drug, not because people that use it are inspired on to harder drugs, but because anyone that wants pot has to know a drug dealer. CVS is not going to push meth while it's selling you pot, but your normal weed hook
4. Weed is, by virtually all accounts, harmless. In a free society, you don't need a reason to make something legal, you need one to make it illegal.
5. We're packing for-profit prisons and destroying the lives of many law-abiding citizens. We lock them up, ruining their jobs/careers, and when we do release them, they're now in a harder situation and with many more criminal contacts.
6. We're arbitrarily denying people medicine and treatments that could really help them. Medical marijuana is often the only thing that can relieve pain and siezures for many people, and is now even being shown to be an effective treatment to some types of cancer. People are suffering, and in some cases dying, all in the name of (not really) inhibiting the use of recreational substance far less harmful (if harmful at all) than alcohol.
7. The only people who have something to lose by legalization are drug dealers, cartels, for-profit prisons (and the industry built around the monetization of incarceration), and beer companies. The rest of society, even non-smokers (like myself, don't plan on ever even trying it) will benefit almost immeasurably.

Oh, you said arguments *against* legalization! Yeah, I've got nothing there... 




 Well, if you lock them out for a period of time, those players will simply be in (and thus leave) fewer games. 




 Legitimate disconnects and reasons to leave the game exist, sure. I'm talking about the ones that do it frequently. The first one each week should be free. If you're quitting more than that, it's almost surely not due to emergencies. 




 It's entirely redundant with her kit, it serves absolutely no purpose in a team fight, and Wailing Arrow is insanely good.

Honestly, if you removed the increased CD for mercs, I'd still take Wailing Arrow. 




 Sounds good to me. 




 I think so. 




 Yeah. Maybe the first game you quit you can't queue until it's over, but the second in a week gets you a 24 hour suspension, with higher and higher times.

Clearly these people aren't that interested in playing the game anyway, and the rest of us sure won't miss them. 




  I still don't see what the benefits are of legalizing it other than some hypothetical talk about how much money it'll bring in from taxes.

It's far from hypothetical. Look how much Colorado has already brought in.

I don't want people getting stoned and then possibly getting behind the wheel or doing something that ends up hurting or killing someone else.

Here's the core thing to focus on: prohibition isn't prevent people from using pot. They already are. Tons and tons of them. Many kids choose weed over beer because it's a lot easier to get. The only things we're doing by making it illegal is giving up the opportunity to regulate it, and funding criminal enterprises. 

If they go making it legal for cancer patients as a pain management drug, do they really believe those patients are going to be the only ones using it?

This is a particularly disturbing comment. If you'd let people suffer in an attempt to keep other people from using marijuana recreationally, I think you really need to re-examine your priorities.

Sure it might slow down the black market for pot

When is legal all across the country, there will be no black market. If you want proof, try and find a liquor bootlegger.

the bigger problem is what pot does to you when you smoke it.

Alcohol is far more harmful than pot. Do you support a return to alcohol prohibition as well?

TL;DR - Prohibition doesn't keep people from using marijuana, and it does far more damage than it prevents (if it prevents any at all). 




 Didn't mean to. Thanks for letting me know. 




 The problem is that in almost all cases, you're better off closing the distance and doing something else.

Much of the time, yes, but not almost all of the time. Knowing the difference is what makes it good.

It's not that the long-range banelings are a hard-to-land skillshot on the Zagara players' part

It's not always about landing the banelings. Often it's about zoning your opponent out.

Anyway, feel free to disagree. I think it's a good talent. 




 The only thing I disagree with is that Baneling Range isn't good. I find it very useful. When you get good enough with it, you can put it to some really great effects, such as cutting enemies off from a route of escape, splitting them up, dissuading a chase you want to avoid, disrupting objectives, adding presence to a fight from afar, etc.

I'm not saying that it's better than the regeneration, but it's definitely a worthwhile talent, once you've gotten good with it. 




 That number, and the ones in the comments, are way, way lower than I would have thought them to be.

Reddit has a maximum population of Ohio... 




 True. It's not a bad pick. I just prefer Hardened Shield. 




 Really clever. Nicely done.

I build a little differently, though:

4: Amplified Healing if we have a healer, if not deadly strike if their team is especially squishy, Swift Reflexes otherwise. SR is nice, but Chen is unbelievably tanky as is, and chances are SR is going to proc during a shield.

13: Enough To Share - most enemies are smart enough to not attack Chen, so extending your shield to allies while you drink is quite valuable in a team fight.

16: Bolder Flavor - You can survive just about anything with this.

20: Hardened Shield - Makes you truly unkillable. I really just take this, though, because the other options aren't fantastic. Bolt of the Storm is redundant with Flying Kick, and the barrel is plenty strong as is. Kind of a lackluster level 20 for Chen. 




 Good for you. Never give up! 




 I agree, but I do really like that there are hybrid heroes like Tassadar, Sonya, Sylvanas, etc., so if there is a change made in this direction, I'd like it to be a small one. 




 This deck was great a couple of weeks ago, but now I can't win with it to save my life. It's just far too slow. Unless I draw early innervates and wild growths (which I mulligan for aggressively), by the time I have enough mana to play anything of value I'm instead spending my turn on healbots to prevent my inevitable demise. Even with the early mana cards, face hunters burn me down too quickly, and I often don't have a way to play around mirror entity. As mages and hunters make up 90% of play right now, those are two very big problems.

Suggestions? 




 What he said:

Despite what Republicans may want you to think, unrestricted free trade is not a Constitutional right.

Your response:

Republicans aren't out to wreck the country just because you don't agree with them on everything.

Quite a leap you took there. 




 As much as I'd like to see poor neglected Diablo get a 7th hero, Fenix would be my first choice as well. I think they could make a really interesting hero out of a zealot, Starcraft needs a warrior, and while they're certainly in better shape than Diablo, they could definitely use a little loving to help balance out Warcraft's dominance of the roster.

And Protoss are cool. 




 That would put it about 3 weeks away, which would really suck. 




 I really hope it's a Diablo or Starcraft hero, especially if it fills a role gap for those franchises (support and warrior respectively). 




 I really want to see Mephisto, Baal, Izzul, Malthael, or one of the other members of the Angiris Council. 




 Making him slightly weaker than the Hearthstone version. 




  Get your shit together republicans.

FTFY 




 Is this a quote from something awesome? 




 Write an op ed.  




 Did it eat the freezing trap? 




 Are you under the impression that people can't get weed now?

Let see how the younger generation is effected, as teens become more frequent users.

Many kids choose pot because it's easier to get than beer. I'd be amazed if actually regulating marijuana, instead of effectively ignoring it, doesn't decrease teen use. 




 Instructions unclear. Punched friend in genitals. Did not hurt. 




 Constance Justice 




 Tyrael. Total bad ass and bully. If only he had a trait.  




 My favorites are Master Tyrael (both white, which I run, and black), and the green Hellscream Thrall.  




 Black master Tyrael is great, but I like the white one better. Fits his character better, and as a tank I want to have a big, bright presence.  




 It's gotten a lot worse lately, too. Never used to be much of a problem but now I see it somewhat frequently. I wonder if I've just dropped in MMR to a place where these immature players are more frequently seen.  




 Suggestion: buy a hero. 




 Or the state could just stop murdering people. That sounds like a pretty good plan. 




 And how will we deal with all of the glaciers!? 




 Majordomo, a legendary so bad that you're better off giving him to your opponent. 




 "These games wouldn't be as good if it wasn't for the opponent across from me".

Classy guy. Wins handily, but he's still gracious enough to compliment his opponent. That's the demeanor of a true champion. 




 "Even though some might say this is just a teenage prank, who knows what this teenager might have done," Nocco said.

Based on that logic, you could charge somebody with murder for picking up a knife. "Who knows how many people he might have stabbed!" 




 There are a number of issues with it, but the primary one, at least as far as I'm concerned, is that it actually makes you *more likely* to die, as it's factored into his kit's balance. In other words, if it didn't exist, they would have to buff him in some other way to keep him balanced. The more they buff his death, the weaker he is while alive, and thus, less likely to remain so. 




 Cool concept, but having faced him in Hearthstone, I don't know that I could take that much of the voice actor. 




 Tyrael just needs a better trait and he'd be fine. He's really fun, and very effective, but his trait pretty much doesn't exist.

A minor stat buff might not be untoward, either, as his stats are very low across the board, but the trait is the bigger issue. 




 Do we think this is for real?

I, for one, would love to see faster hero releases. One of the best things about this game is the variety of the heroes and their playstyles, and I can't wait to get my hands on more. 




 Tyrael is a full tank, he is designed to soak damage, not die.

I main Tyrael, and I build him very tanky, but I disagree with this. I think he does a better job initiating and bullying than soaking damage. He's not squishy by any means, but I would consider him an off-tank, not a full tank.

I think that would change if he had a worthwhile trait that contributed to his survivability, though. 




 The big problem with death traits is that they're factored into a hero's balance, meaning not only does Tyrael's trait do nothing to keep him alive, it actually makes him *more likely* to die, as the rest of his kit pays some price for his death explosion. 




 Disrupting the enemy's positioning momentarily is *very* little recompense for losing your tank. 




 The problem is that death traits suck. They're basically a small reward for being bad, and they do absolutely nothing for you while you're alive.

You could buff his trait to oblivion and it would still suck. 




 Agreed. His trait is practically non-existent. It does nothing while he's alive, and hardly anything when he dies as it's both easily avoided, it's almost never enough damage to get a kill, and even if you do get a kill, your team is now missing a tank.

The big problem with death traits is that they're factored into a hero's balance, meaning not only does Tyrael's trait do nothing to keep him alive, it actually makes him more likely to die, as the rest of his kit pays some price for his death explosion.

It'd be much better if he had something that helped *avoid* his death, rather than making his death slightly inconvenient for the enemy team.

Here's my idea:

 **Archangel's Watch**
 
 Every time a hero deals damage to Tyrael, that hero gains a stack of guilt which decreases damage done to Tyrael by 0.5% per stack. Upon reaching a maximum of 10 stacks, the hero is deemed guilty and one of Tyrael's wings reaches out and grasps the hero. Guilty heroes are always revealed and have an additional 5% of the damage they deal to Tyrael reflected back at them.
 
 If a hero leaves Tyrael's area of influence, all of that hero's guilt is forgiven, and if Tyrael or any of his enemy heroes dies, all enemy guilt is forgiven.

This gives Tyrael some additional survivability (after a while he's taking up to 10% less damage from heroes focusing him), and it's very thematic. You shall pay for your sins, but an enemy's sacrifice can absolve you of your guilt. And Tyrael does use his wings when he fights, because he's a bad ass. 




 Thanks! 




 Good advice. I almost didn't ask for this reason, though I'm still curious. 




 How can you see their rank if they talk? 




 Welcome! Glad you're having fun :) 




 It could even be a boat! 




 If they bring the cast back together and make the show snappy once more, then I'm excited. Season 4 was just a terrible, confusing, poorly paced, unfunny mess, and if it's more of that, then I'm not even going to bother watching. 




 What's wrong with that song? 




 This is huge. I was really disappointed when they removed the AWD option from the 60. Not that I could afford $70k, let alone $75k, but it's nice to know that if I could, that I again would. 




 Agreed. The Kerrigan text is on screen for literally less than 2 seconds.

I would pull this down and put some more time into it. 




 Why Overload? I get your point about not being able to take advantage of Conjurer's Pursuit, but what does the extra range get you that's worth losing the mana that comes from Psi-Infusion? 




 This is why I'm really glad that there's no surrender option. I've been down like this and come back. I know it's rare, but I'm glad that I always have the option to try. 




 Life finds a way. 




 Do you keep inane amounts if glitter on hand for such an occurrence? Or would you have to go (hopefully) buy some? 




 Diversity is healthy for the party. Also, I consider myself a liberal, not a democrat. 




 What does "Basalisk" refer to in this instance? Is that the name given to the theoretical killer robot? 




 Bad form. 




 It is awkward, but play him enough and you'll get surgical with positioning it. It's a feel thing, and it comes in time.

And yeah, I generally ignore the speed boost. It's nice, and on some occasions I factor it in, like if I'm not in any danger but an ally is, I'll use it along with my Q and W to help them escape. But largely I just use it for the damage.

 When I went to WWDTM a couple weeks ago (with Richard Price), I had *so* much fun

You snuck the body of [an 18th century Welsh moral philosopher and nonconformist peacher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Price) into a taping of WWDTM?

Impressive. 




 Agreed. I've come back from some pretty staggering deficits, as well as been on the other end of that stick. The fact that you can be way down, but win a crucial team fight that positions you for the win means that every single fight matters.

One of my favorite things about this game is that it's not over until it's truly over. Players that understand this will have an edge over those that don't, and that's a good thing. 




 Cool!!! Eventually! Someday. Maybe... 




 Awesome! Thanks for posting this.

  Finally, Motorola has yet to release Lollipop for the 2013 version. At least for the US AT T version. I know that they mentioned having problems with the chipset, but if fast updates where part of the phones promotion, and it's been this long and we still don't have the latest update, then it's going to make me not want to do business with that company in the future.

This is the big dissuading factor for me, as well. It took 2 months to get 4.4.4, too, and we never even got 4.4.3. 




 Hence the fact checking...

 What is "this"? 




 Awesome! 




 I agree. Any time I've used Possession, I've thought wondered what picking up an extra minion per wave was really doing for me, considering how hard I could push lanes anyway.

More importantly, though, was during team fights, I was really wishing I had something that was useful in a team fight...

I like the charge idea a lot.

 Glad to see both shaman cards are good. Almost as glad I was to see that both mage cards are weak. 




 He's probably referring to the arena where warrior is extremely weak. 




 How did you check your average game length? Time a few? 




 How does one keep game times down? Really fast decks and forfeiting a lot? 




 Pre-grats!

What's your secret? Incredible patience? Do you forfeit a lot to stay at lower ranks and get better opens? 




 'Cause of the metric system? 




 Quartermaster with cheese? 




 Great site. Just need something to deal with the trolls. Auto-hide functionality based on downvotes is probably ideal, but in the meantime you might want to delete some of the more egregious ones.

Also the ability to un-vote would be nice. So clicking downvote twice would bring you back to having not-voted, like reddit does.

Thanks for the effort! 




 How can you see the ranks of your teammates? 




 Though probably not the one he intended to make :P. 




 Great idea. That works be super cool. 

I love the interactions between the heroes. I wish their were more of them.  




 For #2, I generally find the reverse to be true. The more pushed our lanes are, the farther we are from our towers. That's why I try not to push without a good reason (e.g. upcoming objectives). 

Is my thinking flawed? 




 Around $80USD.  




 How did you play it? Straight push? Run from fights and ignore objectives? 




 It's not correct, but it's accepted. "He" and "she" are singular, "their" is plural.

Many of us use "their", though, because "he or she" is very cumbersome, and there just isn't a better alternative (yet). 




 Done. Thanks for the suggestion. 




 My first thought as well. The immortal's shield doesn't proc on lethal damage, but I think it's close enough. 




 Who said anything about the immortal being Fenix? 




 If it's early September it will only come out approximately 2 years before the 2013 gets 5.0.2.

I wonder if the Moto X 2019 will be released before we get 5.1.

Bitter. 




 Similarly, don't pee *into* the hot tub, either. 




 The music was depressing. Kind of killed it for me. 




 Makes sense. I'm just surprised that he uses it for fine work, too. That has to take some serious mastery. 




 Great tips! Would love to hear more.

Thanks for sharing! 




 Got it. Thanks. 




 Makes sense. Really I just want to know if 90 is low or high, and what that number being lower or higher means. 




 Poor Tyrael really needs some love. 




 Fantastic!

One suggestion: lose Title, Role, and Franchise. They don't really provide much (especially title), and they take up valuable horizontal real-estate.

Thanks for putting this together! 




 Before this current free hero rotation, I swear I hadn't seen him within my last 100 games. Not once, on either side. 




 Nice shot. That had to feel good. 




 Which episode is it from? 




 What is this referencing? Sunny? 




 And Ainsley gets to pee in Leo's closet? 




 I say pack token, and if we're going down that road anyway, also implement golden card tokens as arena (but not pack) prizes. These let you change a card of an appropriate rarity golden (e.g.an epic token can make a common, rare, and epic token).
