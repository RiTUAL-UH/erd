 I love that store. I always go there when I'm at the mall. I love cookies. Makes me happy to eat cookies. 




 Congratulations! Merry Christmas. Good luck with the new house. 




 I want mine to get pregnant too. It's also been difficult. 




 Wow I got all misty eyed. That's sad. I'm glad she was able to see you really enjoy your gift first though. Wow. 




 My wife experienced something similar around that age. Her and her younger sister both woke up around 3 or 4 am and cried because no presents. Their parents had been waiting for the kids to fall asleep and ended up falling asleep themselves. When the girls ran to their parents and were sobbing, they were convinced Santa was just late. After the girls went to bed, both the parents rushed to the hiding spot for the presents and rushed around wrapping them. 




 Same for me. Got married on Halloween. 




 It was 2004. I was walking with my brother "C", his girlfriend at the time "M" and her best friend at the time "B". I was about 16, C, M and B were all about 14/15. A beat up old blue/rusty car full of ghetto looking 30 something guys pulls up next to us, I was on the outside of the group closer to the road. I told everyone to go ahead, these guys looked aggressive. The guy in the passenger seat told me to move and let him get a better look at "her" gesturing at M. I told him fuck off and bring his old ugly car to the junk yard where it belonged. He pulls out a very large pistol and waves it sound and then aims it sideways at me threatening to shoot, the rest of the group had already made it to M's house. I ran and he fired one round and missed then they peeled out in a cloud of smoke. I told my dad about it immediately and we got into his big truck and chased them down. Dad shot at them and they ran off the road. Btw we lived out in a very rural area and the entire police department was friends of my dad. I never saw that little blue car again.

TL;DR: Perverted "gangstas" in old car tried to get to my brother's girlfriend and they ended up getting shot at. 




 Glass bottles full of habanero hot sauce. Bottle brakes and cuts the target. Hot sauce burns open wounds. Win! 




 I had a job as a correctional officer at the local state penitentiary. Loved going to work. I had two regular days off but I would have worked those too if they'd let me. I never took personal time off so it just kept accumulating. It paid pretty poorly for that field of work but I didn't care. I absolutely loved that job. I made a minor mistake in paperwork and was fired. It really sucked because that job had potential.  




 TL;DR: born, lived, expects to die one day. 




 Each episode is exactly one hour and four minutes apart. 11:00, 12:04, 1:08 etc. This is only relevant for the episodes I scrolled through. I'm certain it's relevant to at least the 7th or 8th episode. 




 Another one: breaking bad and Malcolm in the middle. 




 Scrubs and Ground Floor. I know scrubs is over but a guy can dream, can't he? 




 Christmas isn't Christmas without a real Christmas tree because of the smell. I don't care for the artificial crap either. There has never been a more Christmas smell for me. 




 I've tried this twice and the first one it did not guess after asking 60 questions. The first was Greg from Hay Day. It guessed Johnny bravo 




 I hate mountain dew. That crap is horrible. 




 Not do the stupid shit that caused me to lose my job. I probably would have continued to pay off my debt with my dad. Oh the good ole fantasies of paying off debt. 




 "Wait... if this is Mr. Goldman, then why does he still have his foreskin? Then he's not the Jew. Damn he almost lost his left nut." 




 Most of the stuff I read on this thread doesn't bother me but when I got to the sleep paralysis thing, I say nay nay. I suffer it enough on my own along with some PTSD sleep dysfunctions. I don't need any help making it worse. Goodbye to this thread. 




 Just realized most everyone here is mentioning age. I'm 25 btw. 




 Avoiding the lava floor by hopping from couch cushion to couch cushion. 




 We must be related... 




 Commercials: Not ALL commercials, just some. If your product is actually worth anything, if it does what it should, great. Advertise the Hell out of it. I could rant about poorly advertised products all week. I'll list an example or two but there are many commercial styles that bug me. Amazon kindle paper white. The commercial where everyone is using it and one person compares the brightness of it to the brightness of the iPad (whichever version). I'm not a fan of Apple products but I can't stand complete and total lying in advertisements. They show both tablets screens and the iPad screen is really dim and the kindle screen is really bright. Words pop up near the iPad the read something to the effect of "The iPad is on". They are insulting the intelligence of the potential consumer. As though we wouldn't realize the iPad's brightness setting is all the way down. The kindle is a great product and can hold its own, in the market. No need to blatantly insult my intelligence and lie about the competition's product. If I had to choose one of the two products I'd go for the kindle if they hadn't produced that commercial. Now I would choose neither because I still don't care for Apple. Now example 2: The wax vac commercial. This style commercial is moronic in its own way. Sticking a q tip in one's ear canal might hurt a bit but I've never experienced or witnessed someone experience pain enough to cause me or anyone else to scream as loudly as he had. "OUCH!" really? Tone it down a bit. If your product is as great as you say, don't make alternate methods look terrible, just make it known your product is better. Be factual about your product vs the other one. Like the viewers have never used a Q Tip.- I'll end this here. 




 Or: keep running all the way. Stay in the Army, you miss it like crazy. You'll regret ruining that opportunity. Everyday, wasted on regret. Every moment, hating yourself. If you stay college is still in your future. 




 Don't get involved with her, just stay in college. Avoid serious relationships until you graduate and find an appropriate career. This way you won't end up unable to be qualified for federal student aid until you pay off that fucking Sallie Mae loan. Then you won't be broke and on Reddit because you have nothing better to entertain yourself with. Also, you won't end up owing your dad and step mom 3 grand and they don't show up at your wedding because you owe them money.... got off track a bit but y'all get the point. 




 I used to stripe parking lots and parking garages in New Orleans. I took home $200 a day (18 hours a day minimum). Katrina hit and bam! I'm here in north Mississippi. 




 I don't know how others feel about him, but uncle grandpa. I hate the idea of this show. 




 Taylor swift... she's fictional right? I mean there couldn't truly be such a talentless dumbass, could there? 




 Laughed...too...much 




 No network connection. Or some form of "Reddit is experiencing heavy traffic. Please try again at a later time."- I've paraphrased. 




 Let's try my name. John, who's the lucky hooker? Hur dur. John, you should be in the bathroom so I can take a shit. Real funny people, after about 25 years, it gets old. 




 I guess I'll hop on the greetings train. Greetings from Cleveland, Mississippi, United states.  




 The season after season 8 of Scrubs. They call it season 9, I call it a pitiful excuse for a sad attempt at a spin off. 




 Would be funnier to do this to the cable/satellite set top boxes because then they'd have to boot up. 




 I've got a better one than my last. I'd be wearing nothing but a tattoo and a smile. Drive like 50 mph over the limit and when a cop pulls me over, just sit completely still and quiet. When he goes to his car to call for backup just climb to the back seat and lay in the floor incase he comes back and tries to reach in the driver's seat. When backup arrives, if they open the doors to search, just slowly climb out of the vehicle like nothing's going on. FUCK THE POLICE!  




 Gotta love hooch. 




 Or switch items out like Pillsbury biscuits for store brand or vice versa. Margarine for butter. 2% for whole or skim. Splenda for regular sugar. Tea for coffee. Etc. 




 I'd hold a hundred dollar bill down on the sidewalk and move it when someone reached for it. Like really far and fast. If they got it, they could keep it.  




 Yo momma so fat she walked past my tv when I started a Lord of the rings trilogy and missed all of it..... twice 




 I'm a guy and I can do that. It's all about memory. I remember numbers very well but I suck at math. 




 I have this same problem. It really brings me down because I'm as harmful as a light breeze. You can't tell them anything like "I'm harmless don't worry about me" because it only makes things worse. They'll never know you're harmless. I'm a white guy and this is tough. I couldn't imagine being a black guy built the way I am, I'm sure that'd be harder what with the way society had deemed black guys as bad news. 




 A supreme pizza topped with another supreme pizza but the second one is topping side down. 




 Drinking rum does it for me. 




 It may not interest you, but my wife carries a diaper bag that doesn't look like a diaper bag. We don't have any kids. Lis of pockets of various sizes. She loves it. 




 I have three brothers. In order of males, it's me, Chris , Paul, then Brian. As the oldest male, I always expected certain things. Like I figured when the time came, my dad would teach me to drive a car with a manual transmission, but no he only taught Chris. There have been other things in life such as this which have caused me to resent Chris but this one caused me the most because it's one of those father son bonding things. I'm also named after my father which one might think there'd be a stronger connection with father and son, but no. So in response to the original question, driving a manual transmission personal vehicle. 




 I just want cellphone signal bars with a triangle next to them. (Roaming symbol) and the words "the after life".  




 Shoplifting and torrenting. I've got about 20TBs of torrented data most of which I seeded to a 20+ seed ratio (good guy torrenter). I have about $1800 in merchandise from various stores in my house. Things included are countertop appliances, such as juicers, electric skillet, steamer, etc. Blu-ray player, a stack of Blu-ray discs and dvds. 20 1 TB  hdd. I'll stop right here. Let it be known I've stopped and don't plan on continuing the shoplifting. It's boring. 




 Go to sonic drive in. Order the bacon double cheese burger (number 3 here) add bbq sauce chilli and slaw. I order without mayo because I don't like mayo. This burger is the messiest burger I've ever sunk my teeth into and so very tasty. I'm slobbering on my pillow thinking about it. 




 This entire town. Fuck the not hiring my broke ass. Fuck their not having a movie theater, or decent mall. Fuck off Cleveland, MS. Fuck off Bolivar county. Fuck off 38732.  




 Raviolis and a nap. (Not exactly healthy but....) I'm Starvin'! Anyone? 




 A Pok'edex for people.(I can't do the accented "e" on my phone's keyboard). 




 To a fat trainee: "a few less donuts and a few more laps and your tubby ass wouldn't be running in the back of formation, would you Grimace?" The DS called the fat trainee Grimace like the purple thing on the old school McDonald's commercials. 




 When people blow their noses or similar things at a restaurant instead of going to the restroom. It makes me cringe. 




 A thousand upvotes to you.
