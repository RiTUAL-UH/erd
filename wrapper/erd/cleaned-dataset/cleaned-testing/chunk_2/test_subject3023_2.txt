 Immediately after the announcement, I tried to feel sad that I didn't win. And I tried. But I couldn't feel sad. There was no reason to (aside from the lack of communication between the hosts and participants). I would have made Running Red anyway, I'd had the idea for a while, but this competition just gave me a reason not to procrastinate. It wasn't about winning. It was about making a good pack. And I feel I have done that. I've made a pack that sends a message, and is unique, which is something that rarely happens these days. I've accomplished my goal, and gone far above it. Running Red got listed, which is something I've only dreamed of. @PurpleMentat , who has always been one of my favorite Youtubers, did a series on my pack. Plus, I tied what is currently the most popular modpack. I consider that to be a huge achievement. I'm happy to have been part of this competition. It wasn't about winning. It was about sending a message. And you know what, I accomplished my goal.

Thank you for all that you've done, and congratulations to Parcel. 




 It (once I finish the story) will have a great impact if you choose to kill the cows and chickens. 




 I'll look into that 




 Forge version 1217 




 The biggest similarity is that is uses HQM.
Public Pack Code. 




 Sometime in the next 72 hours, and playing the first will not affect the second. Completely different experiences. 




 Yes. 




 The pack team hasn't put it on the launcher quite yet. There's a download available here:

Amazing. 




 I had this dream that the results were leaked to Panda and then we grilled him for information. He didn't say anything, and then the results were released.

You won, because you had a Mini-Me of Slowpoke101. Slowpoke said in the dream post that there was no other reason.

It was the worst nightmare ever. 




 You wish. 




 It's LOL. Apparantly it originated on 4chan. I blame ThatOneSlowking for it.

 I like parties. 




 You need slabs on all the sides, and then you can water them with a Watering Can to speed up the growth drastically. 




 I make Running Red. I just want to be First ^ ^
