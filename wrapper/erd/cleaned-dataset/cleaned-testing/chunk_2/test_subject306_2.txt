 I'll be happy if he's Darren Sproles part 2 




 Are people stupid drunk in the draft?  Does it get kinda boring in between?   




 Concerned for your safety?  Oh so when officer Bologna's pepper sprayed those people b.c he was in danger.   




 its all about the chili cheese fries, and they're spicy chicken soft taco 




 If you choose not to attend the wedding, don't tell the fiance either.  My reasoning, is that you're choosing to cut him out of your life completely.  You're acknowledging that he is not your brother.  However by informing the fiance, you're now taking a step back into his life.  Furthermore you're potentially opening up old wounds.  

If you're going to tell the fiance, send a letter, no return address so they don't know who it's from.  At least this way you're not getting caught up in the BS 




 If you're looking for re sale value, I wouldn't go with the studio.  Most young professionals come to NY for X number of years, and by the time they're wanting to settle down a studio is not what they have in mind.  If you can, go with a 1BR.  




 Jelly=Jealous..."I'm so Jelly!!" 




 Go to La Quinta Hotel on W 32nd st in K-Town.  Take the elevator to the top, you get an amazing view of the Empire Building plus great Korean food after you get blitzed.  Plus it's not a stuffy area like midtown/meatpacking.   




 Happy World Hemophilia Day! 




 Never underestimate the "power of the pussy."  Now this is not the same as putting the pussy on a pedestal, it means that in a blink of an eye a woman can get what she wants easily more than a man can.   




 Fish sauce, lemon/lime juice, ginger, brown sugar or honey, scallions, pepper.  Marinade on thin pork chops, grill or broil.   




 Just curious, did this happen in the bayarea a few years back?   




 While you're at it, there's a awesome place called TGI Friday's in Times Square.  Great Value, awesome food.  Just like Subway

 C'mon Man! 




 Is this guy a Redditor?
 




 Is it your 1st time busted in NY?  Courts will usually grant your a A.C.D (Adjournment for Court Dismissal) meaning don't get in trouble for a year after the incident and your case will be sealed.   




 Saute with oyster sauce, water or chicken stock, grated ginger, and splash of seasame oil at the end.   




 Smoking a bowl and stretching while listening to music 




 Let's not forget James Brown  




 Always curious where/who the source is.  For instance, you get your "stuff" from a guy I presume.  Does "that" guy have a higher up he reports to and etc?  How deep does the food chain go?  Are you close to your source?  


 




 After reading this post, you made my Monday a bit more bearable.   




 After reading a bunch of these, I've concluded old people love weed and porn!  Kudos, good to know the youth are still keeping it alive 




 there's a bar i go where they have pickle juice chasers with their jameson.  goes down real smooth

 Spam n Eggs, spam n rice 




 Exactly this.  I'd like to know the backstory to this.  Was there hardcore texts being passed back n forth?  Were they drunk as hell?  It was their first time hooking up, and they went dominant rough right from the start.  That's an open invitation right there.  I'm not saying what the guy did was right, but there's many variables that come into play here.   




 What kind of messages were said back and forth leading up to this?    Clearly this guy took it overboard and violated you, but if you showed signs of wanting to be dominated and taken, this goes both ways.  This was your first time hooking up, you're gonna be going 100 m.p.h with excitement and such.

You've got to pony up a little bit and think what drove this guy to lose it.  Was there booze involved, how many texts back and forth were there, nature of conversation, etc.  Cops are gonna be all over this asking you how you even allowed him to enter your house and hook up?  As much as you are the victim here, when the cops question you and the incident, you need to make sure everything adds up.  There is a huge grey area when it comes to this unfortunately.  
 




 Randy Moss..Oops already signed him!  For Defense, Mario Williams.  Our front line would J. Smith, A. Smith, and Williams.   




 Hopefully this signing will attract other FA's to sign with us as well.   




 Here's a simple one.  Buy a 4 pack of Guinness, pour 2 cans into pot with beef along with some water and simmer for at least 4 hours.  For the cabbage, slice thinly. Saute with garlic and pepper, boil some balsamic vinegar and reduce till thick.  Drizzle over cabbage and drink the remaining 2 cans of Guinness.   




 the "warrant line" won't do shit when you're up against cops that want swift action/justice.  that's gonna provoke them even further.  as a minority that's been in similar situations, i've learned to keep my mouth shut and let them do their thing

 Man she grilled you pretty hard  




 who else thought for a second that the us dallas (red october)was going to pop up from nowhere when the opera came on?   




 Yes.  I can only imagine how tough it is to maneuver a big ass bus around the city with traffic and cars cutting you off 




 Same thing with James Brown, multiple domestic beatings, rape allegations, etc.  It def helps being a better musician, but it's awareness these days.  There's no tolerance anymore when it comes to putting your hand on a woman, as to 30 years ago it was much more common 




 Down some coffee along with that asparagus.  Coffe+Asparagus piss=foul 




 Kobe who? 




 A few years ago i took my then GF on a trip to Hawaii for a friends wedding.  Worst mistake ever, basically acted like a immature bitch the entire time not wanting to do anything except sleep in the room.  Even worse, she forgot her makeup bag in my friends car, and refused to go to the wedding even though my friend was going to bring the bag on the day of the wedding.  Long story short, the moment we landed we broke up which was Valentines Day.   




 We don't throw the long ball which is primarily Moss game.  Big fat NO

 Japanese fella here.  Although the dad is clearly being abusive, it's sorta common for the men to just yell at their wives.  It's Old School mentality.  Is it right?  Absolutely not, but the mom doesn't have alot of options. It's not like here in the states where there's support groups, organizations etc.  Sadly, psycho social support in Japan is not on top of the list.  

And unless there is complete followthru, I actually disagree and she shouldn't inform the organization.  She's only staying for a year or two tops, it's a different dynamic she's witnessing than if she were there for 5 years.   




 A man is running home.  He makes 3 lefts and is met at home with a man in a mask.  What is happening?

 When smoking, what's your preferred apparatus?  vape, pipe, good ole j? 




 This is better than Xmas!  Blow all of the cash and cards tnt, along with the condom.  Here's hoping to a epic night and a story you can post on Reddit.   




 Was waiting for a reply like this.  Dont'  need to try it, I know these ingredients.  It's not guac, its a dip, and even then why attempt to change the natural flavor of an avocado?

 This might not be the best advice, but at one point or another he's gonna have to swing.  Whether or not he wins, isn't the issue, because he'll always look back and know he stood up to something.  Chances are after that encounter, his bully will leave him alone.  And years from now, you guys can all laugh at this   




 what do u guys have in common?  keep it light, n fun.  post this in r/dating 




 Take the time out to heal on this before jumping into another relationship.  Like you said, you're gonna feel crushed, but use this to better yourself out.  Sorry this happened

 How many people come to the park on drugs?  Artist buddies of mine used to like going to the park on acid and then do sketches while they tripped.  Some of it was fantastic, others not so  




 Pretty much yeah 




 In this order.  

1. Make love to my wife
2. Smoke a blunt with my best friends
3. Drink 3 Belgian Ales
4. Dance my ass off  




 Do we draft a big WR?  I'd like to see us get a jump ball type, ala AJ Green, Plax type size.   




 I think it's partly due to self-reflection and realization of who they are while they are in the relationship.  Once they're out, there's a plan set in motion and you go forth.  I know because I did the same 




 Chef friend of mind in CA recently got married.  During his break, the dishwashers asked him when he's gonna have kids.  He said he was gonna wait until he had a little more money on hand and be responsible.  The dishwashers response, "Have as many as you want, the government will pay for it!"   




 Not sure how much football you've watched or understand, but it takes all 11 players to do their job in order for the play to happen.  Not the 3 out of 11 being a meat shield.  

And from a different perspective, when a play goes right, whether it's a 60 yd run TD, or a 45 yd pass, sometimes it's [poetry in motion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1SFA2UDOc feature=related)

 Yeah man, "curiously"  is a great way to describe her.  The more and more I watch I get attracted.

 I thought Cielo had the best sound system, but the Jersey Shore crowd makes it unbearable.  Wed nights are awesome however since its usually free till 11, and room to dance.   




 I slipped a hostess cupcake on the seat of this kid while he wasn't looking.  Of course afterwards it looked like shit stains combined with cum, and for the rest of the day he had to walk around with that stain.  I know, I'm a jerk 




 My friend was hiring at a bank, asked for the applicant's email address.  Her response, "littlelatinkitty@yahoo"  There should be a askreddit for worst email address

 I don't know your family background, but just be prepared that your family will not change.  Issues like this are ingrained in some folks.  Ultimately, this decision will come down to you, whether you want to stay beside him or find someone else to make your folks happy.  It's a shitty situation to be in, I hope there will be a good ending to this.

 More of an observation than a stereo type, but I see self entitlement as a common factor especially amongst white men.  That and no rhythm

 Grab hold of destiny, make it happen.  There's no reason not to be alone tnt

 Live thru them, keep them in your thoughts, and remind yourself how blessed you are that they were in your lives.  I've lost a good deal of friends, what puts me at ease is knowing they played an integral part in my life and that I am who I am because of them   




 Been saying this for awhile too.  These days Kanye should only stick to producing, his flow is getting very 1 dimensional, nursery rhyme style.   




 My coworker in the cubicle next to me constantly clears her throat.  Now I know it's a habit, and she's not doing it to piss me off.  But that sound has been embedded in my brain to the point where anytime somebody clears their throat constantly it gets annoying.   




 I'd go rock, paper, scissors.  I believe in Nirvana, so it's a win/win either way.  I too like to live dangerously.

 Dude you're 20, it's perfectly normal to be single.  You're still in discovery phase, learning about yourself and the world out there.  The fact you're posting this question asking for input says alot.  This stuff will click together, but not overnight, or with 1 chick.   




 My first guess is this has to be a summer camp skit 




 I'm simply calling you out on your "I'm from Texas" statement.  Your references of beef, eggs, and music are all 1 dimensional.  If Texas was even remotely as diverse as SF, I wouldn't even trip.  
 
For example, what's Texas eggs? Drenched in oil, butter, add tons bacon, potatoes.  I don't have an issue if you don't like Japanese eggs, but again I wouldn't bet the house on anything culinary from Texas.  Who is your famous chef?  Tim Love, cmon now.    

Texas Music, first that comes to mind, twangy whack ass country music.  Again how many dimensons?  I can say legitimately that SF is diverse and we can back up our arguments across the board from music to food.  And yes I'm also Japanese so I do know the culture and the gentle complex flavors that are associated with our food.  

Finally fuck the Cowboys!  




 Your explanation was invalid the moment you said you're from Texas
