 Yes. That was surprising but in an amazingly good way. 




 Toronto FC is actually doing extremely well this season... 




 As a Netherlands fan who is not Dutch, I cannot imagine what they are going through. As for me, six contractors have approached me requesting to use the bricks I have shat to build a new apartment complex. Stay strong Oranje! 




 I think the Dutch will finally get that star :) 




 I worry people will lose respect for Julio Cesar who is a fantastic goalie and really has been Toronto FC's saving grace this season. 




 Thanks for the advice, I'll have a look :) 




 Try C and Am :) 




 It helps to just look up the guitar chords and play around with those. Most of the time you only need to make minor changes to make it sound good on a uke. Good luck! 




 Alright that makes sense. Good luck :)
