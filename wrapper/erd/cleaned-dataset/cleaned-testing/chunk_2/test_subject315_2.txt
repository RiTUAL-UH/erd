 She was a coward who killed herself. Learn from it and move on, she no longer exists, you do. 









 How do you sleep at night knowing that your profession revolves around the carnal sins of humanity? What do you contribute to the world other than pain?  I would not be surprised if people have been driven to suicide or worse due to your meddling for profit. Shame on you,  you miserable person.

 Boob ruiners and booger-covered face jewelry. I'll pass. 




 Maybe one day you'll look back and realize what you earned from such unabashed exhibitionism. I hope you find love, truly.

 I think you have deep-rooted emotional issues and need to seek help.  




 Not to worry, you don't have long. 




 You vomiting rhetoric is what made me call you a pretentious windbag in the first place. The circle is closed! Good show. 









 Hey it's been fun. I hope I make it to 77. Hopefully by that age I have my shit figured out.

 Personally I feel like some of the things posted to /r/gaming that are labeled "No Spoiler" are in fact spoilers. They are not spoilers because they give away story, they are spoilers because they give away crucial gameplay elements that would have been fun to discover on my own. Now, if it was a movie, any talk about the movie before you have seen it is a spoiler because a movie is a linear thing, it goes from point A to point B and if you give up something in between that line it's a spoiler. A video game on the other hand, or any video game worth its salt, is a non-linear dynamic media that somebody interacts with. I get pleasure out of discovering things about a game, about the little nuances and side-routes. I make it a point to never read a walkthrough guide until after I have beaten the game by my own wits. For example, I saw a "Last of Us" post about how it is a survival horror game with no scare jumps. Well great, that takes away some of the suspense I might be feeling when I finally play it. Or, on a post I have made a while back I labeled as a "Minor Spoiler" because I told people the best way to kill a Cazador in New Vegas. But people complained, said that it wasn't a spoiler. But to me, it definitely was because when I found out how to do that on my own a whole new world of gameplay elements opened up to me in New Vegas. So...I leave it to you...should we modify the spoiler policy or am I just bitching to the wind?

TL;DR I think that certain things labeled "No Spoiler" are in fact spoilers because they give away gameplay elements.
