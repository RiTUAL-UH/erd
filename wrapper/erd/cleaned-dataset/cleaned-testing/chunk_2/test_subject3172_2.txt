 I read in a book once about an idea for a machine that could take your brain out of your body and fit both it and your body with transceivers so you'd keep functioning as your brain communicated with your body. 

So your body is outside the glass container holding your brain, and you think, "Here I am looking at my brain. Wow." Then you realize, "Wait, shouldn't I be thinking 'Here I am with my body looking at me'?"

I think the book was by Raymond Smullyan. 




 I did that one all the time when I was a kid and had never heard of yoga; can barely do it at all now, and only for a couple of seconds. 




 Maybe because they're dressing for their own comfort instead of your gratification?  




 Some people consider that capability in the language a bug. I say it's a feature. 




 The nice thing about English is how adaptable it is. In the informal register that permeates Reddit post headlines, "AM" meaning "morning" is perfectly legit and easily understood. 




 Damn, you punctuation! 




 The irony (if that's what it is) is Jason isn't my friend's birth name; he adopted it when he wanted to make some life changes including moving to a different city. Not sure how he chose it. So I guess it doesn't matter if your "real" name isn't Jason, you're still in the spirit. 




 I love this. 




 My friend Jason always looks puzzled when I call him July-to-November. 




 Your order should be ready next week. 




 Not to mention, some people who like both X and Y only have the money or skill to make one costume, and if it's for X they'll still wear it to Y-Con, and more power to 'em.

(I have neither money nor skill, but I love seeing other people's costumes.) 




 The God of Thunder went to ride

Upon a pure white filly.

"I'm Thor!" he cried.

His horse replied,

"You forgot your thaddle, thilly."

 When I go to Dallas I try to have lunch or dinner at Cosmic Cafe near the arts district/downtown, it's a funky vegetarian Indian-inspired place. Good coffee. 




 I agree with the commenter above. Owning a plane means you don't spend hours in departure lounges every time you travel for business, or have to take an inefficient route through a commercial hub. When your job is basically to be in charge of billions of dollars, the time you save is more valuable than the cost of the plane. 




 The problem that this county wants to address isn't "some people are homeless," it's "some people are bad." Check out [this article in the conservative opinion magazine Commentary](http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/be-open-handed-toward-your-brothers-1/) that starts out saying we should try to improve the lot of the poor, but Step 1 is "personal moral transformation." Many people in power view prison as a tool for moral transformation -- be righteous or be punished. This is part and parcel of that worldview. 




 A lot of students work on campus, and a good number of them have probably joined the state employees union. I did when I worked there. 




 "effect" as a verb means "bring about," so privatization would actually de-effect those jobs, so to speak. (Yeah, it's a stretch, but I can never resist a bad wordplay.)

[Obligatory relevant xkcd.](http://xkcd.com/326/) 




 This may be in response to the university's plan to privatize a bunch of campus services, which would affect a lot of state employees.

EDIT: /u/robertrulez [says](http://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1xadtq/wtf_is_going_on_campus_loud_chanting_and_marching/cfaes2g) that's what it was. 




 The "Tits or GTFO" sign reminds me of a guy in Wichita during the big abortion protests there in the '90s, he made a sign that said "Show Me Your Tits" and joined the protesters; IIRC he said he was right next to them waving his sign for an hour before they noticed. 




 There's a dog across the street whose entire vocabulary of barks translates to "Hey, scratch my butt. No, don't stop." His tolerance limit has not been found; one neighbor spent about five minutes scratching this dog just to see if he'd get tired of it, and he didn't.

 Coincidentally, it's also Portsmouth time in the streets of Bath.  




 Thanks for the information. (They say the best way to find something out isn't to ask but to make a wrong assertion. :-) ) 




 Skywriting has been around much longer than GPS (nearly 100 years), so it's a skill thing. I don't know, but I suspect that in addition to detailed planning, they watch shadows on the ground for orientation.

 Aw, he loves you! Why the long face? 




 A friend of mine moved to Central Texas from Iowa years ago. She said that on her first visit she was surprised to see the reflective lane markers sticking out of the road. "Don't those interfere with the snow plows?" The ... what now? 




 Are you going to believe what you read, or are you going to believe what you see? 




 This particular plan may or may not work, but administrative bloat is one of academia's biggest problems, and it's rare to see it actually get addressed. 




 I lived a couple of blocks north of there for two years, and the distance was rarely a problem. Of course most of my classes were in the northwest corner of campus, so I didn't have far to go anyway.

If you can walk to 29th and Lamar, the 338 bus goes to the HEB at Hancock Center. (It may be shorter to walk to 24th and Lamar from where you'll be.) Also the 21 bus goes from the campus area to the Fiesta Mart at 38th and I-35, which is also a short walk under the highway from that same HEB. And Wheatsville Co-op is on Guad at 31st; it's a bit pricey on most items, but you can get some basics there without spending too much.

EDIT: Also, The 338, the 3, and the 22 (the same as the 21 only going the other way) also go to or near Central Market on North Lamar, which is basically an upscale HEB.  




   "... that company blends in the flavor of whatever company is asking for it."

I can't help noting the implication here: That Tropicana, Simply Orange and other brands' juice all come from the same place, they just get slightly different flavor profiles when the shipment is split up between them.

Not that OJ is unique in this regard ... 




 I thought trees made the wind blow. The trees would start moving and the wind would start blowing ... I had to be told that it happened in the other order.

Similarly, I thought when it rained somewhere, it rained everywhere.  




 Houston has 6 of the top 10 and 12 of the top 20. IMHO they shouldn't bother posting such incomplete data.  




 This is somewhere between incomplete and totally bogus. A 49-story building in Odessa? Really? And it's a Best Western? 




 Fred Phelps the head of the clan was a respected civil-rights lawyer before the nuttiness began. He had a lot of friends in the local legal community for a long time after he went all holy war; don't forget that anti-gay sentiment has always run deep among blacks in this country. If he had been Fred Phelps the Actuary he probably wouldn't have lasted long. 




 The bandwagon effect [is real](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6146/647.abstract). Saying you're not subject to it is the same as saying you're a freak of nature, like those people who claim that *they* can text and talk on the cellphone while driving and be perfectly safe. Nope. 




 How about that! 




 A little no-name sixplex near the north end of the Red River shuttle route. It's nothing special, and all the units are occupied ATM. The management company is Beck   Co., and I know they have other similar properties, so you could check with them. But I think a locator service is your best bet, since they deal with multiple landlords. 




 You're gonna need roommates. I'm 2 miles from campus in a tiny $500 studio; even other places in my neighborhood are going for a lot more.

Your best bet may be to use one of the apartment locator places you see on the outskirts of campus; you tell them what you want to pay, they'll show you some in that range. That's how I found this one.  




 Flash Motorbikes on Burnet Lane is my go-to service place. When I need a tow the guy gives me a discount because he can stop by after dropping his kid off at preschool two blocks away. He's had several chances to overcharge me and not done it. 




 In general, if the original increase was keeping pace with inflation, then it wasn't a *real* increase, only a *nominal* one -- it looked like it was going up, but it was only because the counting system in use was being degraded by inflation. It's confusing the measuring stick (dollars) with the thing it represents (purchasing power).

(This is not a comment on the policy in the OP, just on how these discussions often go in general.) 




 So it's a reduction relative to inflation, which does count. 




 Someone said economics is "quantitative psychology." Strewth. 




 Pornography is objectifying -- we don't see the participants as fully realized people. If there's a story involving the participants, it's basically just a frame to get their bodies together. Erotica engages more of our brain, shows us the characters as people with a full set of desires.

It's not a clear dividing line; some porn does some humanizing, for instance. It's a spectrum. 




 "I can't hear when you all talk at once" is one I've heard for that occasion. 




 "Why don't I go to bed so you can go home." 




 If you do the arresting part right, the court part will go much more smoothly. Officers take the longer view.
