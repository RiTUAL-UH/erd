 Hey internet providers and cell phone companies; I get it, you have a board you need to appease, you gotta make money somehow or you're going to get fired.  You've tried *everything*, from upping the rates to imposing data caps. 

But have you tried providing an excellent service, at a reasonable price, without being evil?  I think that may help you get an edge on the market, and get more and more people to sign up for your service.

I'm no economist, but I *think* that may help you beat your opponents into the ground.

 Does this require special equipment ? Sounds like a way for individuals to annoy people and entities that they do not like and sounds hard to detect for the non-specialist. 



















 This is still a very bad move on Marriot's part. Unlike ISPs, they do not have a monopoly for overpriced short term lease agreements in almost all of the markets they're in.

For  executives who travel on business, I know connectivity is VITALLY important to them. If they know that they will be unable to get internet without paying $20/night, their administrative assistants or travel coordinator will have a sticky note on her monitor that says "NO MARRIOT."

I bet Marriot's going to learn this one the hard way....

Want to make a difference in local government?  You want broadband included as a priority in your municipality?  If you live in a municipality that has any sort formal planning processes, you need to get it on the radar of your Planning Commission, and included in your Comprehensive or Master Plan.  The bad news is that if you live in a place where no formal planning takes place at all (e.g. all counties in Texas, as far as I know) you likely live in a place so red and "freedom loving" that the idea of "municipal" mostly doesn't exist.  Texas counties, for example, don't do any planning at all.  Many cities in Texas do plan, however.  Some even have massive budgets to do it with.

------------

**tl;dr:**  1)  Form a local interest group with focus, goals, and consistency.  2)  SHOW UP.  Get noticed.  3)  Find out who the decision makers are in your municipality.  Find out what they do, what they are required to do, where they get their authority.  YOUR OVERALL GOAL:  Get municipal broadband included in your municipalitys Comprehensive Plan as a defined community goal.

----------------

Step 1:  Form a *local* interest group.  Local is defined as people who live close enough together to meet time and again.  To get attention, your interest group doesn't have to be sane, rational or even right (half of regulars at your local Council/Commission meetings aren't).  I would recommend you be all three if you want to really be effective, though.  Your goal is not to lobby Washington D.C.; it is to lobby City Council Members/County Commissioners and Planning Commissioners.  You'll need:

-Leadership (not this "everybody-is-in-charge" OWS crap).  
-Goals (not this "we-want-everything" OWS crap).   
-Focus.  This goes along with Goals.  You must know what don't want, or are willing to give up (again, none of this "we-want-everything" OWS crap).  You are not Wage-Equality group.  You are not an Anti-Poverty group.  You are sure as hell not OWS or an offshoot.  You are the Municipal-Broadband Group.  This is what you are, this is who are.  You are an organization with clear, distinct goals and focus.  YOU ARE NOT OCCUPY WALL STREET.   
-Committed membership.  Commitment equal that of the retired, pissed-off old people who show up angry and pissed off at every meeting.  Commitment equal to those oldsters who will be dismissing you, belittling you, ignoring you, and trying to push you aside so they can talk about what *really* matters (like a new subdivision ordinance to let them up-zone their land and sell it for massive profit, for example).  This is where Step 2 comes into play.  SHOW UP.  
-Consistency.  You are nothing until every member of the City Council, every member of the Planning Commission, every County Commissioner, the Planning Director, the Public Works Director, and all of the Long-Range-tasked Planners in your muni know the names of every single one of your group's principles.  They should be on a first-name basis with you.  Until this happens, you don't matter.


Step 2:  SHOW UP.  Show up at meetings of your City Council/County Commissioners and show up at Planning Commission Meetings.  The only people who show up for these things regularly are the same 5-12 pissed-off old people, *every single time.*  This is because the meetings are boring, and no young person in their right mind wants to be there, not even me (If I'm there, it is because I am getting paid).  SHOW UP ANYWAY.  Your group should never let a meeting pass without at least one of your principles being present and accounted for.

Though I would recommend you come prepared to be all three; remember that you don't have to be have to be smart, informed, or even rational to get heard.  Half of the regulars there aren't, I guarantee it.  Don't let them intimidate you; half of them are suffering from dementia.  If you are smart enough to know what "Municipal Broadband" even is, and why it is good, you are probably smarter and better informed that anyone else in the room on your topic of choice.

Step 2a:  Remember what I said about the same pissed-off old people showing up time and again at local government and planning meetings?  Yeah, as an intermediate step you may find you have to first campaign for evening meetings in your municipality.  Seriously, a substantial number of "public" meetings are held when most of the productive working public is at work, which means you can't attend and no one in power has ever considered that this might even be a problem.  If you want a good indicator as to how much of your local policy is set by old people (e.g. retired people) just look up the meeting times in your muni for Council and Commission meetings.  That alone will tell you all you need to know about who really matters in your community.  If every Council and Commission meeting happens between the hours of 8-5, and you happen to be under 55, I've got a news flash for you:  YOU DON'T MATTER TO ANY OF YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS, AND NEITHER TO ANY OF YOUR PEERS.  You don't matter because none of them have ever seen you before.

Step 3:  Research the following people and things:

All members of your City Council/County Commissioners.  
All members of your local Planning Commission (if you have one).
The Planning Director for your municipality (if you have one).
The Planners for your municipality (if they exist).
The Long-Range Planners for your municipality.  Each muni is different.  Some split Long- and Short-Range Planners into departments or sub-departments.  Some munis task only one Planner with everything.

Find out if you are in a GMA (Growth Management Act) state.  If you are, then your munis are partly governed by things called Comprehensive Plans.  These are mostly written by Planners tasked with Long-Range Planning, with input from the Planning Commission and the Public (that's you!).  *These things matter, in a GMA state they are supposed to have force of law.*  In a non-GMA state, they kind-of have force-of-law (it varies from state to state, and how much they matter really depends on who is in office at the time).  If you are in a GMA state and want municipal broadband, I don't see how it happens without this being worked into your muni's Comp Plan.  If you are not in a GMA state, you may still have a Comp Plan for your muni.  Find out if you have one, and when the next update is scheduled, and how you get involved.  If you live in a muni where Comp Plans exist and have force-of-law, getting Municipal Broadband included as Comp Plan goal is a HUGE step to making it a reality.  In a GMA state, you can potentially drag a muni before a State Hearings Board if the muni has a defined goal in their Comp Plan but take no steps to implement it.  Hearings Boards can sanction munis that violate their own Comp Plans. State funds can be withheld.

Step 3a:  GMA vs. non-GMA:  Find out how Plans are created in your state and in your muni.  Do you have a Growth Management Act (a state law) or equivalent that requires Planning?  Alternatively, do you live in a state where Planning is legal, but not required (e.g. Texas)?  

Examples:  Washington is a GMA state.  Planning is enabled and Comp Plans are required by law (RCW 36.70).  Most munis do not have an option about creating one, they must make one.  They must have certain required components.  Munis don't get to opt out.  Most Comp Plans end up with mostly the same structure, because the GMA says so.  If a WA State muni doesn't Plan correctly, they can be punished by the State for not doing so; by the Growth Management Hearings Board or the state legislature.  Idaho is a non-GMA state.  Comp Plans are required, but Idaho does not have GMHB equal to WA state.  There is basically no enforcement on Comp Plan creation in ID, and some of the Plans are really bad as a result.  Planning in Idaho is allowed to be done by munis through the Planning Enabling Act (Idaho Code Title 67, Chapter 65).  Munis are given almost complete freedom in the creation of their Comp Plans.  Comp Plans are still supposed to have the force of law.

Find out how your state and your muni do planning.  Get involved.

In general, remember that political will to enforce Comp Plan goals and policies is generally less in Redder states, and generally less in non-GMA states.

 I think people forget that the independent agencies like the FCC really aren't supposed to obey the will of the people - that's not their job. Their job is to regulate in the way they best see fit (whether or not the way they see fit is good is another argument). The premise of this (which is, as you said, technocratic) is that the will of the people isn't necessarily the best choice, and often *isn't* the best choice. People are very easily led astray or misguided.

Gotta also remember that Verizon sued the FCC about net-neutrality... *and won*. The FCC really cannot do *anything* at this point without doing a ridiculous amount of research, otherwise they risk being sued and losing again.

If you want what is supposed to be the will of the people involved, Congress needs to act. Organizations like the FCC were created so that they would be apolitical and unbiased (whether they are or not is questionable). It's also the reason that it's rather difficult for presidents to *remove* heads of independent agencies - it promotes them being apolitical, since they don't have to bend to the will of leadership. 




 FCC in February:  "It was a really close decision, but we've decided to ignore the entire nation's population and do what a handful of rich guys are telling us to do: destroy the internet." 




 I have good empathy but I'd be less tolerant of others' flaws if I won the lotto -- I'd tell a lot of people to sod off. 




 * "Don't tense up with the cold wind - relax, no really, relax, let it pass through you."
It was very Jedi, and it works... I just have to remember it, because it's a reflex to tense up in the cold.


* For the sake of the environment/your wallet, you DON'T need to leave the heat on all the way when you leave the house. DO leave it on a little bit, though. I generally turn it to about 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit). When you come home, turn it back up, put some new warm socks on and keep your sweater and hat on until it's warm again.

* When it's very cold outside, or you are leaving the house for a few days, you may need to leave the faucets running a little bit so they don't freeze up.

* Get plastic sheeting to insulate your windows, you essentially shrink-wrap it with a hairdryer and it creates a bubble of air that will block any drafts.

* Use thick curtains, but open them while the sun is out to let the heat in.

* Keep your doors closed inside the house.

* Make or buy draft stoppers from fabric and dense filling and put them at the base of your doors and windows.

* Cook a lot! Make sure you have proper ventilation for boiling, sauteing, etc. because the steam will cool down and it will actually be counterproductive. Baking is best, and after you bake leave the oven door open to let the heat escape into the room. 




 The question  would be 'listen to the following story and tell me what you think?' 

                   

There's a priest, a minister

and a rabbi.



    

                   

They're out playing golf and

they're trying to decide...



    

                   

how much to give to charity.



    

                   

So the priest says, we'll

draw a circle on the ground...



    

                   

...we'll throw the money way up

in the air and whatever lands...



    

                   

inside the circle,

we give to charity.



    

                   

The minister says "no", we'll

draw a circle on the ground...



    

                   

throw the money way up in the air

and whatever lands outside...



    

                   

...that's what we give to charity.

The rabbi says "no, no, no"...



    

                   

we'll throw the money way

up in the air...



    

                   

and whatever God wants,

He keeps.
