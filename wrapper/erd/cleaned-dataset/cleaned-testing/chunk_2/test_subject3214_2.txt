 Actually, if there are 10 great tasting calories per 8 fl oz and there are 20 fl oz in a bottle, there should be 25 great tasting calories per bottle. OP is actually getting a free 5 calories of great taste. Way to shop smart OP. 




 What do people think of "Recorded on: _____ " time stamps for future Let's Plays? Personally I think it would make tracking the near-countless inside jokes we hear easier among other things.

In the beginning of the Cannon Ball Run GTA IV Let's Play, for example, Gavin says, "What if this video comes out before the other one?" To which Michael responds, "Well then people will be confused." I think time stamps like that might be a bit more helpful to us, the viewers. Just spitballin' here.
