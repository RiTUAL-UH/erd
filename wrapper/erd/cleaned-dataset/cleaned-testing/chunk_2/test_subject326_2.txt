 It sounds like you guys may have an entity in your house. It can be attached to the house, land, or one of you. I agree with alot of the other posters about trying a night or two away from home. If it follows you, then its not the house. Might I suggest those shake-battery flashlights. If power fails, kinetic energy will likely prevail at least. Here's a question for Shauna: Have you ever dabbled in the supernatural? Playing with Ouija boards or trying to talk to spirits in graveyards, or the like? Sometimes it can cause something to pay attention to you. I know OP said he had toyed with one before. They have been known to bring about bad entities, and it may not show itself right away either. Sorry if it doesnt ease your worries any, but I'm trying to throw up any possibilites at this point. 




 oh wow! I've never thought of using quartz for grounding. I know it can hold energy though. I usually use my bare feet on the ground for grounding. I do get the whole feeling a spirit but not communicating with it thing. I am sensitive to the energy they emit, but the stronger ones can make contact with me, most often when I'm half asleep... (normally just their voice, but sometimes they will show themselves) which is why I sleep cocooned in my blanket for the most part. I pick up on people's moods so easy, though it doesnt really work unless I'm on the phone or in person. I have walls in place to block most of it, but its really hard to tune it out if I make eye contact, which is why I very rarely do. Makes job interviews difficult, but otherwise it's bearable. The only odd upside I've found is I'll get a song in my head, instantly turn on the radio, and there it is :)
