 i've put up a logcat long back on the page.
What more info is needed? i'll try to provide max details :) 




 i've tried all, beta, stable and nightly...but its still present. Hoping it gets resolved soon :) 




 i did try it out, still a major WIP but a real good effort :D 




 ah yes, very true that opera handles much of the processing on the server side.  

But i've had extremely good browsing experience on both dolphin and the stock android browser. I feel they dont disapper off because they are very lightweight in nature.   

If Firefox has just a bare browser thing on android, it would be awesome.

4.1.1 device here :)   




 it actually doesnt involve particular pages.
For eg. scrolling through general sites like Facebook, Complex just close the browser down. (i did file a bugreport on this issue - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1041968)  

Heavily noticed this happening while scrolling when the page is loading. 




 I've noticed a lot on low RAM devices(=512), the browser just disappears after a light usage run. I mostly suspect an Out of memory situation is the cause of it.  

But if a really light version like the something in the likes of a opera mini version happens then firefox can surely run stable on low end mobile hardware. 




 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1056875 




 i think its the problem with this new switching graphics tech.  
Hopefully someone will give a solution :) 




 Song to Siren - Candy soundtrack 




 ah nope
only H-title, video downloadhelper and downthemall 




 i've tried chrome, and things remain almost constant.  
I've tried on fresh profile, and all addons and plugins disabled.  
Guess ill open a bug report.   




 i really have a strange GPU issue while using firefox.  
My system dell n5110 has an Intel i3 and nvidia 525M optimus(Hybrid) running with bumblebee(Proprietary drivers) on Fedora Linux 20  
Every time i use Firefox, the GPU fan goes on and off over and over after a certain time of operation.  
My normal laptop temp is around 48-54C but when i use the browser its slowly rises above 60.  
The Processor clock jumps from 101MHz-1200MHz  
The Graphics clock jumps from 50MHz-600Mhz  

I've tried switching off Hardware Acceleration but this still happens.   









 thanks a lot for your time :) _/\_ 




 there's a lot of speculation that it could be Shirley Mansion of garbage 




 ah its not, song to the siren is a different one :/ 




 The song appears in the candy trailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrudC0STJ0U  
The songs appears at 1:15  
Most believe its some unknown Australian Song.  
It's not present on the OST.  

Few of the words in the songs are:  
don't you worry  
about the flight yeah  
careful and true... we've flown  
sing for the way we've grown... we grown  
 




 thanks a ton, _/\_ it sounded so familiar!
i've listened a lot to this and yet it slipped away from my head  




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtIzADkd504

Could anyone let me know the song playing in the background? 




 This post should be stickied 




 lib-ray-off-is 









 Instabug, you guys should get intouch with Facebook, their android app kinda seems like hopeless now. 




 your issue is strange, try browser reset or new profiles (proceed with caution to back up data first).  
And check for updated sound card drivers.  
Incase its still faulty, then please do file a bug report.  

EDIT- webm and vp9 are implemented in Firefox but still needs smoothing out. So if youtube is serving you in these formats, then thats most likely the problem. 




  che, the issue disappears. But it appears again in a while.
 
 I should mention that I am usi

do you have mediasource enabled in about:config? 




 if you're on the stable release, try reinstalling flash and see.  
it looks more of a connection problem.  

If you feel its a browser problem, then try clearing cache.  
Still plauged with the problem, try a browser reset or a new profile.   




 your issue on linux? 




  #tabbrowser-tabs tab:not([selected="true"]) .tab-close-button {
  display: none !important;}

Hey thanks @shortkey :D :D :D
i just needed to change display: inline :D 




 try clear cache? 




 but i guess voting can bring about a perspective on the yays and nays of new features(mainly UI changes).  
Core technologies should be done as per firefox devs, which is much better in their hands.

 




 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856427 




 Why does the close button have to disappear just after 8 tabs?  
Its kinda annoying. Chrome allows upto 18 tabs with the close button present.  

Im kinda sure people have more than 8 tabs opens in a normal browsing session.  
Pic - http://imgur.com/01Eop1T  

Anybody know of a permanent way on keeping them on? 




 All the best to the new man!  
Hope we sail strong through the internet! 




 i guess a simple webpage where people vote yes/no on a new ui change or so could be an easy task for Mozilla, and better for Firefox progress as well. 




 Browser - firefox  
Arts - blender, Inkscape and GIMP  
Audio video - audacious, VLC, Winamp  




 Honestly changes are great as it happens.  
But then there are certain ones which are kinda very different, and need a lot of talking back and forth and agreeing to.  
For eg. the tab screen is really starting to look weird in nightly :/  
Is there any such forum or place where normal people can interact with the firefox development community? 




 also the rounding
 









 Lots of unticks on Chrome and Firefox even when they do support different things. 
 




 search for this 'media.mediasource.enabled' and enable it in about:config.  
its still a bit buggy when playing vp9 encoded videos - plays fine thought -test it out. you might like it.   

edit - To check if its on visit http://www.youtube.com/html5 




 if you really want to take some extreme steps delete the .mozilla folder in your home directory.  
Im also a fellow Fedora user with 2 Firefox versions, stable and nightly, and both are working fine for me.   




  d the Google Talk Plugin, and I've installed NoScript consistently with each new profile.
 
 Fair point though, a bit of digging says SIGABRT is triggered by angry libraries? I'll tinker with profiles (add-ons) in mind. Thanks. 

ill suggest a totally non-addon approach first on new profiles. check if that helps.
Or else remove it via yum and reinstall and see if that helps 




 Thats true. But I've faced similar playback issues on Vimeo as well.
The content would have already streamed ahead by the player will start playing for a few seconds, stop and if it wish continue playing more or until i click the play button again.  

Also the loading(buffering) bar keeps going out of its limits into infinity and beyond.
 









 sadly chrome is much smoother in video playback on linux 




 Try a complete system update and reboot or Try reset the browser.
If thats not helping create a new profile. 




 i would include all video sites in general. 




 codec for playing most web content - http://www.openh264.org/ 




 its happening on both Youtube and vimeo for me. Can't make a switch.  
HTML5 here we come! 




 ah the kernel 3.15.4-200.fc20.x86_64  
and Fedora 21 is still away

EDIT- GNOME yes they havnt updated, they'll be pushing it out on the next version with wayland support 




 oh okay, not much familiar. i'll just shut my mind :| 




 But pretty much everyone installs them anyway, because otherwise your video players don't work.

thats true, but i guess mozilla is trying for an out of box working option.  


and also, i think might be better if a software runs with its own set of stuff, than pulling stuff from the OS every now and then 




 i guess most distro's don't ship the bad and ugly versions of gstreamer.  
Also Windows tech is proprietary  




 i saw this after the latest update 




 Thanks for the link! :) 




 Fedora 20  
Gnome 3.10.2 




 Seriously wish it had a fill background option too. 




 and thank you guys for making a great browser! :D    
i wish i knew how to code properly and contribute. i only know bits and pieces of C++ 









 Is it possible to extend a persona theme as a complete background onto the speed dial area? Im not wanting a background addon that allows me to choose a background image, but something that just utilizes the persona theme itself or the colors in it to give a good back ground 



















 You just need this and all's good https://www.google.com/tools/dlpage/hangoutplugin

 




 Do try out the beta or nightly version. They kinda work better than the stable version for me.File bugs too when crashes happen. 




 It has performed much better in recent times but things like chrome displaying the page as soon as it loads, kind of create a better illusion of speed.
Things need to feel very smooth for the users.
Even the tab movement area is much smoother and of larger area in chrome that in Firefox. Miss the area and you create a new window while reordering the tab. 




 maybe chrome might use google dns built in(not sure).

But since the android app is also not working, it needs to be a DNS issue. Bombard BSNL! xD 




 the instances ive got crash reports, ive submitted, but this as you found out was different  




 thank you for the link! :D 




 yes...you too? 




 Sad state :/  
something good needs to be done to thwart that drm cancer. 




 hmm probably true, i use like a normal user, i'll have apps that maybe running in the background without me knowing also.

ill shall try find the log file and submit soon 




 I don't see how Shumway will allow Firefox to get users back. Most people don't exactly use Flash voluntarily. They need it because video sites require use of patented codecs (H264) and DRM.

Linux users are fed up with Adobe flash(no new versions-except security updates), and most crashes happen due to flash or some flash based content on webpages. Plus lots of people use YouTube and other video based sites a good part of usage, having something inbuilt and stable like shumway like the way Google does with Pepper, it should probably improve the reliability of the browser. 




  Can you please file bugs about these issues? This sounds really strange, should absolutely not happen, and we don't know of any current issues like that. Do you have some task killer or anything installed that's nuking Firefox while it runs?

Sure i shall file a bug, but i just have no content to attach to a report sadly :/
It'll just close down without any message while browsing. And i dont use any task killer.
 
 It already uses very little memory, and will work well on any Android phone with as little as 384M RAM (Firefox uses FAR FAR less, but your other apps will eat up most of that!).

i do know it does uses very less, but when other apps are also present, then things get slow, like using swiftkey, whatsapp, facebook and firefox one after the other :/
  




 i think some DNS server is at fault.  
Unless someone fixes it, it'll be the same situation for people who are routed through that server or ISP.  

The bigger problem is that YouTube is not aware of this issue. Some thing similar happened to WhatApp users in india connected to a particular ISP. Only after the social media and news exploded was the service fixed.  

People need to inform YouTube about the issue! Attack Social Media! 




 Hats off to the developer community for all the work they've done all these years. Truly, its been a great product. And i keep hoping for more good stuff from you guys! _/\_ MASSIVE RESPECT    

A little focus on more important things will probably show a positive change eventually. It will take time to fight back whats lost to chrome, but im sure a good number of them will be Firefox users who are wanting to come back to where they felt at home before.   

I guess Firefox also needs to increase its social media presence, Google can do it for Chrome through their ads system, but Firefox has to fight it out without spending much on Facebook, Twitter etc.

Once Firefox fixes up electrolysis and Shumway, that coupled with the privacy, peace of mind and the add on ecosystem, it will be a great combo to make some groundbreaking ad to get back whats lost, and add more new users.  

it will take time, but these should be worked on with a great pace now, coz time costs everything these days.   




 i agree the attitude of the common man is hopeless.  

only few of us try to make a valid change. I try a lot to convince people to shift to Firefox. Some do but others just stick it to the other competition because it works out of the box and without any trouble.  

I still feel Firefox has every chance to grab back the market it lost, if it starts focusing on the current basic essentials to web browsing.  

Back to square one is the need of the hour. 




 i feel the browser should focus on delivering speed, lower memory usage, per Tab process and shumway.  

Honestly i don't think normal people do care if a browser is super developer friendly with all the features it provides; The general crowd wants the content or webpage to load super fast and with very little to no problems.  

I've tired Firefox Beta on Android and the Nightly versions too, but there are lots of performance issues, when compared to others in the market. Ive got lots of instances when the browser will just close without even a Crash Pop-up to send an error report.  
Plus Firefox Mobile needs to make use of less resources(RAM etc.) of low end phones, since most of them are 512 MB RAM mediatek chipsets.

Its been a really long wait from the browser that was a game changer back then :( 




 i think its a DNS issue, lots of people are facing this, but in certain locations, or based on the browser.  

Cause chrome is able to go through. But the YouTube android app is totally failing to play and same with Firefox.  

Using google dns solves this problem :D
YouTube or your ISP(im not sure whom) has to fix this problem.  

https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/

 




 enabled as default. still no change on Firefox PC version.  

i've also noticed that the android YouTube is also failing to play videos.  
This is totally weird, since its working perfectly on chrome(desktop).   




 same issue, works on chrome.
latest nightly build. FF33.0a1 Linux 




 same state unfortunately :/  
But please do spread the news if you can to others who could help out. :)    

Lots of apps have language support problems because there not enough user contribution   




 i also have a horrible problem on vimeo, where the video stars playing, streams ahead but the player automatically stop and ive got to hit the play button again. Very annoying!
Linux Build.  




 Since the keyboard is now free and everyone can download from the Google Play Store, it would be great to have Malayalam language support for those like typing in Malayalam on their smartphones.

Kindly contribute to testing if you could. Or spread the message!

http://vip.swiftkey.net/index.php?/forum/531-malayalam-feedback/ 









 same, i was deeply interested in the Gary McKinnon case but everything seems to have disappeared.  
I also feel that's there a lot of classified technology that could be used for the greater good but haven't been made public for political or monetary reasons. 




 Hello 

UFO, aliens and any other cover ups, Still speculation or is such info being suppressed?  




 yea, plus the 400 word message after the limit is just a fantastic move to communicate if all goes well.

Its about as poetic as apps come. It should feel like postcards rather than letters,

 Give This Man(Elon Musk) A MEDAL! 




 so many low cost devices suffer due to thier old policies 




 its sad if its a flash issue :|  
i hope Shumway comes through fast.  
But then all sites have this problem to a varying extent, leaving me totally clueless on what/why its happening :( 




 yeah, they had been horrible with kernel support.  
hope that will change soon for the better 









 I've been noticing this for quite some time now, video's even though fully loaded tend to stutter a lot during playback.
It was more profound on vimeo, when the playback stop and the video  button changes from the pause button to play button. The video was fully loaded though - http://vimeo.com/48043470 - this was the video, while this thing was happening.  

Its also present on facebook videos, though to a lesser extent, and least on YouTube.  


I played the same vimeo video in another browser(chrome) and it was playing very well, even while streaming without any stutters.

Fedora 20 Linux, Latest Updated Nightly. 




 Well, it's like an iTunes clones visually, with support for themes and add-ons. It's good for managing music when you have a large library. It's got SoundCloud, last.fm integration among others. Auto scrolling lyrics support. And the most important of all, it still works as a browser.  
I use it and am definitely happy. Of course there are minor bugs here and there bug for a normal user I don't think it'll be a problem.   
It's the open source version of the now abandoned Songbird media player.  




 its more of an annoyance when people are trying to get work done fast.  
Something like ad pop-up windows ruins your internet browsing flow 




 maybe a few millisecond time delay if you hover over the bookmarks icon, to add to bookmarks, can fix that issue i guess 




  't been fixed yet, along with some tab-tearing and tab-pinning visualization, when Australis is all about "beauty" and "sleek-ness". I guess it's because Firefox ships with tabs on top by default, which makes the lack of this "tab sliding movement" almost unnoticeable (or less painful) in maximized state, because you can just press your pointer against the top of your monitor and when moving the tab (that is

It is however a pain on Gnome shell, because on the main panel on the top, so even if you move up a bit, your off the main firefox window, and eventually create a new Firefox window.  
This exists on the latest Nightly too. 32.0a1  
Opera is simply sweet in that gif you've uploaded!
