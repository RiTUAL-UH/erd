 Yeah my garage has been duplicating my cars too... weird.  




 From what I've heard the Surface 2 is only a few hundredths of an inch thinner than the Surface RT, so thinness isn't really that big of a difference. Apparently the weight difference is quite nice, though I haven't had any problems with the weight of my RT. I got my 64 GB RT for $200 and I feel no incentive to upgrade to the 2 except for the better screen. I think $250-$200 is the perfect price point for the Surface RT 




 I have the AMD Radeon HD 6630M and I can run at at 40-50 fps. Just run it and play around with the settings a bit.  




 Surface RT runs on flash memory, not a hard drive, so the slowdown shouldn't be from there. Did you run Windows Update multiple times? The updates fix a lot of the lag/slowness issues.  




 Those floors are only accessible by CS students. If you have a friend in the CS department, just have them open the door for you. The elevators work the same way too. 

Or you could get lucky and "conveniently" walk in after someone opens the door.

 I can do Half Life 2.  




 In order of interest: 

* Chivalry: Medieval Warfare
* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
* Max Payne Bundle
* F.E.A.R. 3

Willing to trade any or all my keys for any of these games 1:1. Or counteroffers I'm not particularly picky.  




 I have three copies of Killing Floor as Steam Gifts, includes the game and Defence Alliance 2. Looking for any offers.  




 Just give IE a try. I was skeptical at first too but it really is a great touch experience in tablet mode.  




 Realistically, what do you use NFC for? And why is it so important that if it doesn't have it it's a deal breaker?

Not bashing, just curious. I think NFC is a great tool but I haven't found any practical applications of it that would make it a deciding factor in purchasing a tablet or phone.  




 MathXL puts the CORRECT answer in the box after you get it wrong, so the answer in the blue box is NOT what you input. If you mouse over the box a window will pop up saying "Your answer: _______." I'm sorry but I'm 100% certain you input the y = which is technically an incorrect answer.  




 Well the y = is already given... so technically you DID input the wrong answer. 

I know, I hate MathXL as much as anyone else, but you just gotta learn how to deal with the annoyances.  




 Bought one of these and it did come in original packaging. It arrived packaged and presented as if I had bought it direct from Microsoft.  




 TI calculators, like the TI-83. They were invented 14 years ago and they still cost $100.  




 Really? Send me a link for a flashable rom? 




 Can't believe Sense 5 is on a Samsung Galaxy product before the HTC Evo 4G LTE and the HTC One X.... 




 I will be in an efficiency.  




 Sounds awesome, thanks! 




 Yeah I realized that as I was going about my business today. TJ Maxx also sells pans and dishes, too. 




 Refunded the whopping 1 cent they paid.  




 Well I'm still going to be going to Target anyways, no way I can bring all that stuff in one carry-on :P 




 Thank you! Did they really give you a dining table and a couch?? 




 Yup, I know that. I wouldn't expect them to give that to us. 




 What appliances are included in the Fairfax kitchens? Fullsize fridge, oven, stove, microwave, sink? There's no information on the housing page.   




 New Facebook cover photo right here. 




 Stark didn't say it was vibration proof, he said it *absorbed* all vibrations, meaning the shield can still vibrate but none of that energy is transferred to the wearer. Big difference.  




 I see. In which case decide whether a college degree is really worth it to you. If you foresee yourself getting a better job/being happier once you get a degree then go for it. I don't want you to be like "well what do I do now?" after you graduate.  




 You should go only because of the fact that it's a unique and rewarding experience. College is a unique experience because everyone there is living together and striving to achieve the same objective - the only other place like that is the military. The lessons, skills, and friends that you have there makes it well worth your time.  




 There was an incident that happened during Orientation Week at my school... it is now known as the "Brown Leg Incident."

During the first night of school a guy invited a girl to his room, and they began to get down and dirty. His roommate was trying to sleep on the top bunk and got so fed up that he left to sleep in the lounge. One of the RA's walked by and asked him what was going on, and together they went to investigate the room. 

While the two lovebirds were alone they had switched to anal sex, and were going at it full force when his roommate opened the door. The shock from the door opening and the ongoing sex caused her to unleash her bowels in full force all over the guy's leg, and due to crappy school food it was runny and full-on disgusting. We all ran out of our rooms from the sound and saw the couple covered in shit and fully embarrassed. 

Both students switched dorms after that.  




 On the thumbnail it looks like his nose is made of a dirt block. 




 Looks like Frogger couldn't handle this challenge, either. 




 I've always felt it was the other way around... Name a few games where you think this happens? 




 DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAAAAAAAAY 




 Sounds like your girlfriend's a keeper. 




 Just because someone uses those services doesn't mean they don't like face-to-face conversations. 




 AWWW HAAAAAAIILLLL NO 




 .... How did this happen?? 




 Insidious. The most terrifying thing I have ever watched in my life.  




 Lifeguards will give you so much hell if you bring those to a public pool. 




 It's pretty obvious how to use this machine correctly, too.... wow.  




 I think you should stop replying to his texts outright... To a guy, any response means that there is hope that you will actually get with him.  




 Pikachu doesn't even know what's coming... 




 DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAAAAAAY 




 stoopid hooman... 




 Could have put the rupee ocarina in a pot and had him smash it, too. 




 Typical rich, preppy white girls with Macbooks and Coach bags. Doesn't even look like it's raining that hard.
