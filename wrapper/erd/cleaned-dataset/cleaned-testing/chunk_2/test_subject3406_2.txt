 As someone who was born 100% deaf and had surgeries as an infant that restored my hearing to relatively "normal" range, I am baffled, putting it mildly, that there is a segment of the Deaf community that attacks cochlear implants for treating deafness as a disability and not a cultural identity. Have you encountered any hostility for having the implants, and how have you dealt with it? 




 Bench trial. No jury, so verdicts can be a heck of a lot faster. 




 Didn't mean to criticize-I was just confused. It was an interesting (and I'm  sure, frustrating for you) story, and I'm glad you shared it! 




 Note: I am not your attorney, I'm not giving you legal advice other than to tell you to seek counsel in your area, I am not advising you on courses of action to take or when things have to be done.

Disclaimer out the way, if you're in Montgomery or PG county, I might be able to give you some names of attorneys in the area.

It's a misdemeanor-a crime that carries a potential fine and/or potential jailtime as well as MVA points. It's probably a decent idea to consult with an attorney in your county-this isn't a mere parking ticket. 




 I strongly urge you to consult a lawyer to advise you how to handle the charges. For one thing, you'll want to investigate if being found guilty or pleading to the Utah charges could affect your current probation. 




 I am not licensed in Minnesota. I cannot give you legal advice. 

I'd continue to keep an eye on the MN case records, but I'm not sure what you could gain by contacting the court or DA's office yourself. If you are concerned, you could/should contact a local defense attorney. He or she can advise you what to do next, if anything, and if it becomes necessary to speak to the court or the DA's office, he/she can do so on your behalf. Remember-anything you say can and will be used against you. That's not just a TV line. 




 Unfortunately, this sort of thing is a common scam as others have noted. It sucks, not just because you're out $50, but also because it means that when folks are in situations where they legitimately need emergency cab fare etc., it's impossible to differentiate oneself from a scammer.

You could contact the local police, since you have their phone number and it actually goes to them, but if it goes to a burner phone, or if your local police are a busy bunch, you're sadly out of luck. :( Sorry. 




 Thank you. :-) 




 That saidI'm not convincing you, you're not convincing me, and nobody else is participating or paying attention. We might as well agree to disagree and leave it at that. 




 Depends who you ask.

 Your hypothetical: "if a Senator proposed a sweeping ban on "obscenity". There's already a sweeping ban of obscenity, as you seem well aware. 




 You proposed a faulty hypothetical for a law and actions that already exist, and I'm splitting hairs for pointing out your hypothetical is pretty much already in place?

Senator Feinstein didn't claim that she was qualified to write a law because of her experience with the shooting, she pointed to her 20 years on that Senate Committee and 9 years of experience as a mayor, too.

Yes. There is no exactly analogous ban on obscenity. What this has to do with the price of tea in China, however, escapes me. Getting back to the original argument, that we have plenty of limitations and exceptions to other Constitutional protections like the 1st and 4th Amendments, not specifically enumerating what is and is not obscene is not something that makes it less of a limitation on First Amendment protections. I'd argue that it is a greater limitation because of the chilling effect and, I'd argue (and lose in court, but I'd argue it anyway), that the nebulous definition of obscenity violates the void for vagueness doctrine. 




 Ah! That would make sense. 




 Is there context that we're (or at least I'm) missing, or did this woman randomly decide she won a prize? 














 And if you insist on a Senator arguing for prosecution of obscenity, instead of merely the Romney campaign and GOP '12 party platform, how about a letter signed by 42 Senators (the vast bulk of them Republicans but some Democrats, including Senator Feinstein), calling for prosecuting all major producers and distributors of adult obscenity, with a focus on internet porn. http://www.politico.com/static/PPM153_obsc.html 




 Here's how I can claim obscenity prosecution was a top priority of the Bush Justice Department: http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1125318960389 slreturn=20130216131119

As for your complaint we've moved from your original point, let's recap. Your original point was that if a Senator proposed a sweeping ban on obscenity, you'd hope other Senators would be as zealous (your word, I'd choose others) as Cruz was the other day with the 2nd Amendment.

When I pointed out we already had a sweeping ban on obscenity, you complained I pointed to caselaw and not a statute. When I pointed out the statute, you complained it was little used. When I pointed out that it was a major priority of the George W. Bush Justice Department, you complained that the small percentage of convictions was negligible. When I pointed out that the Republican party and Mitt Romney stated their intent to do exactly what you claimed would be outrageous (going after a wide range of porn on the web and elsewhere), you ignored it.

Which one of us is moving the conversation away from its original point, hmm? 




 Wouldn't the wiser course be to contact the cops and ask them to deal with it? If there are drugs, guns, etc. inside, do you really want any level of responsibility for it? 




 Peter David's "Q-In-Law" is a classic.... 




 I agree entirely-two years as a sample size is not enough to determine whether global climate change IS affecting tornado season. I was more interested in the bottom third of the article where it discusses the competing forces on how global climate change COULD affect tornado season. 




 This is a bit of an odd role reversal given my original comment, but it appears you are arguing based on passion and I am using facts.

How many people are currently prosecuted under the federal obscenity statute? Not many, perhaps, but during the GWB Administration, the DOJ taskforce targeted some big fish, and all it takes is a few selective prosecutions to have a massive chilling effect. You didn't see the internet suddenly devoid of porn, but more fringe pornographers did close shop for fear of prosecution.

Big names that were targeted include Paul Little (AKA "Max Hardcore") sentenced to 4 years in prison(1), Ira Isaacs (who came to public attention for distributing the 2 Girls, 1 Cup video) was sentenced to 4 years in prison(2), the DOJ prosecuted John Stagliano for milk fetish porn(3), and a woman named Karen Fletcher was prosecuted for "fantasy stories...pedophilia, torture of children, and murder of children."(4) Fletcher's work was disgusting, but it was also purely text-no children harmed in the making of the work and all.

I can do better than naming a Senator-how about a major party's platform and a party nominee for President? Yes, that's right, the Republican Party platform in 2012 stated, "Current laws on all forms of pornography and obscenity need to be vigorously enforced," and the folks who pushed for this language made clear that they meant going after porn on the internet, on pay-per-view in hotels, in retail shops, and on pay-per-view on cable/satellite TV. (5) Mitt Romney himself called for strict obscenity prosecutions. (6)

**the tl;dr version is (1) that Bush made obscenity prosecution a major feature of his Justice Department; and (2) that the most recent Republican Platform and Mitt Romney made it clear they intended to use current obscenity law on the books to go after 100s of types of images and movies, and if Senators or others raised hell, we seem to have both missed it.**

Federal law prohibiting importation or transporting obscene material: http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1462

Note that during the GW Bush presidency, he instructed the Justice Department to form a task force to go after hardcore pornography. 




 I'm merely a consumer of weather-related information, but to my novice eyes, this seemed like an interesting look at how warming trends may increase convective available potential energy while decreasing wind shear. 









 There IS a sweeping ban on obscenity. Under Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment. 




 Good for you! That sort of mistreatment of employees is beyond unacceptable. 




 Ted Cruz's condescending treatment of a fellow Senator was disgraceful, and your link's describing Senator Feinstein as "lash[ing] out with emotion and hyperbole" continues the misogyny. (Taking a thesaurus to "hysterical" doesn't make the sentiment any better.)

Senator Feinstein wasn't a recalcitrant witness. She was not there to be cross-examined. Cruz was free to make his argument, as silly as it may seem. (There ARE limits to the First Amendment. Child porn is but one-material support to terrorists, fire in a crowded theater, fighting words, obscenity, time, place and manner restrictions, etc. There ARE limits to the Fourth Amendmentvehicles is certainly a huge one.) But Senator Feinstein was free to make her points, and was under no obligation to answer Cruz's haranguing questions. 

Senator Feinstein made her points based on her years of experience as a US Senator and politician, her experience with the previous assault weapons ban, and her experience putting her finger through a bullet hole on Harvey Milk's neck as she tried to see if he had a pulse. 




 Wired magazine has a decent writeup explaining the court's ruling and its significance. http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/03/nsl-found-unconstitutional 














 Um, story time? When was this? Do you know what happened next? 









 The only advice I can give you is a caution that "If anyone has experience with copyright law (particularly in Canada)" isn't the right inquiry. The only thing that matters to you (assuming that you're in Canada!) is Canadian copyright law. The copyright law in the US, UK, or the Federated States of Micronesia won't help you in an actual legal dispute (as opposed to an academic conversation).

Try finding a clinic, a public interest group (like the EFF in the US), or whatnot to help if you can. Otherwise, please do speak to a lawyer in your jurisdiction. 




 The kid on both teams wasn't Danny Alamonte. This wasn't a 13 or 14-year-old ringer on the 10-12 year-old team. I don't see how this team got an unfair advantage from the kid playing on two teams, and it seems really cruel to strip them of the opportunity to play this weekend. Surely this could be dealt with without the need for collective punishment of kids. 














 If the accident was indeed both of your faults, you might not be entitled to anything from the insurance company. Or what you're entitled to may be reduced. Or you might be able to recover in full with pain and suffering damages. It depends on the state, and a lawyer can help ensure you don't screw yourself over. Proceed without a lawyer and you're likely to eff yourself over. 




 That's adorable! What is the kitten's name? 




 Where in the county? I've had good luck with Medstar Health. I go to their location in Spring Valley, about 3 blocks past the Bethesda/DC border on the DC side, but they have lots of locations throughout the metro area.

Since they're associated with Georgetown Hospital, I'm pretty sure Medstar Health takes most insurances. 




 But there was no evidence, to my knowledge. 




 Incredibly misleading way of phrasing it. Your phrasing suggests that an Israeli film crew actually did hand out candy to get people to dance. 




 Not a huge fan, but I supposed given the conservative nature of the present cardinals, there are few options I would have been a fan of. His position and his past statements on same-sex adoption are particularly disappointing.

 The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a non-partisan office, scored the Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare") as reducing the deficit. Republicans such as Paul Ryan continue to make false claims that repealing Obamacare would aid with deficit reductions when in reality, it would increase the national debt.

Why isn't the President, and the White House, being more forceful in rebutting these false claims? I understand that the President is trying to reach a "grand bargain," and to do so, he is trying to court Republican votes (or at least stop obstructionism), but by not going on television and repeatedly demonstrating that these claims about Obamacare are not true, it allows conventional wisdom to form that Obamacare does raise the debt. That's not helpful for an eventual grand bargain. That undermines national support for the President and for his policies and continues to ossify public perception that the GOP's plans would lower the debt and not merely shift the tax burden from the wealthy to the poor and middle class. 




 This doesn't make a great deal of sense. Yes, he was on sick leave for an extended period of time, but if this was cause to fire him, why wait until now to sack him? The vast majority of the comments have focused on how long he was on sick leave, but that is irrelevant to why he was sacked.

Looking at the stated reason to why he was sacked, according to the Independent, is that if he was well enough to travel to Australia, and well enough to grapple the shark, he should be well enough to work. This does not seem logical. For the sake of argument, let's view things in the light most favorable to Mr. Marshallsea. Being on leave for stress shouldn't mean he is on bed rest, going on vacation seems like a reasonable response. Whether it is in Australia or London shouldn't make a difference. That he was capable of grappling with a shark is not particularly of import because he was not on leave with a physical disability like a bad back, injured shoulder, or what not.

Given that going on a vacation is a decent way of dealing with stress, and that his reason for being on leave was psychological and not physical, what difference does it make that he went to Australia or grappled with a shark? 




 Hmm-perhaps that's what she was going for, but even then, as a former ANC Chairperson, I'd think she'd constitute a public official, and her statements were certainly an issue of public concern, namely alleged corruption and theft of public funds. 




 Good question, and I'm not sure what the best move is. One of the risks of truth serum is not just that one might be found sane, but that one might say something damaging in response to a question that might have led to pleading the Fifth had one been in one's right mind. 




 There's a surprising dearth of articles on the subject, but there are some, and they support what the Guardian reported.

 I agree-it sounds like bad science and like something that should not be admissible, but it also sounds like something that should not even be permitted to be attempted.

You and I are in agreement that this should not be admissible, but I respectfully disagree with your assessment of this as bad reporting. Sounds like the Guardian got the events right, and the judge may have (I hope) gotten the law wrong. 




 I hope it's only bad reporting-if it is as described, it seems rather horrifying. What part of the report are you disputing? 














 I'm not a DC licensed attorney. My understand of DC civil procedure is that the DC courts give a more generous view of pleading than other jurisdictions, but even then, to my eyes, the complaint embedded in the linked article seems incredibly flimsy.

1: The statute Ms. Seegars cites does not state what I think she thinks it does. She cites 23-542 which discusses wire interceptions and interception of oral communications, and yes, certain conduct is prohibited by this section. Unfortunately for Ms. Seegars, 23-542(b)(3) states that "it is not unlawful under this section for...a person not acting under color of law to intercept a wire or oral communication, where such person is a party to the communication." Joshua Johnson was a party to the conversation, he recorded the conversation, and unless he recorded it with the intent of using it to commit a crime or other injurious act, it's okay under the statute. In other words, DC is a one-party-consent jurisdiction, both parties were in DC, are DC residents, Ms. Seegars is suing in DC court, and the statute she cites is one of the defendant's best defenses. Bwah?

2: The statute she cites is not related to libel and slander. It's a wire/oral communications interception statute. Bwah?

3. She does not specify in her complaint what exactly she is claiming to be libel and slander. As far as I know, and if I recall correctly, DC does not share the same heightened pleading requirements for defamation that other jurisdictions have in place, but even then, the allegations need to be specific enough to allow a defendant to form a responsive pleading. Merely saying "libel and slander", without specifying what the defamatory remarks are, is not sufficient to my knowledge.

4. Unless there are remarks the article is not referencing, it would appear the defamatory statements are things she herself said. In which case, bwah?

Is there a logic or merit that anyone sees to this pleading, or is it the rantings of a pro se plaintiff abusing the legal system?

 Indiscriminate? Hypothetically speaking, if the strike that killed the infant in question WAS an Israeli, would it have been indiscriminate, or would the determination that "Palestinian militants were firing rockets at Israel not far from the al-Masharawi home" persuade you that an errant strike, while awful, happens in wartime? Collateral damage is not avoidable-mistakes happen. 




 She was thinking about buying flowers and therefore she should still get the promotion? By that logic, a guy who was thinking about going to medical school until he flunked organic chemistry and switched his major to film should still get to practice medicine. 




 There are sites where you can do research for free. If you're having trouble using them, well, as I said. Law is hard for the layperson. 




 Law is hard. You can't just google symptoms and get a sense of what the range of options is. Every case is different. Your options, how much you can recover, statutes of limitations, etc., all turn on the individual facts of your case, and moreover, it's not just what the facts are, but what facts you can prove and how you can prove them.

There are real reasons why lawyers licensed in jurisdiction A can't practice in jurisdiction B without getting admitted to the bar or being allowed to hire local counsel. The cynical, and partially accurate reason, is a monopolistic attempt by each state bar to protect local attorneys, but the other reason is that every state's laws and rules differ, and even in areas of law with a lot of similarities between states, it's easy to screw things up.

Saving yourself the legal equivalent of a callout and labor can quickly lead to completely screwing yourself and leaving you with no remedy or no defense (depending on which side you're on). 




 The customer isn't always right, but the customer is sometimes right. Had the exception been printed on the receipt as it was supposed to be, fine, but it wasn't. That's not on the customer. That's on the store. Shifting explanations to vague "health and safety" concerns would likely only make one more suspicious/angry.

You wrote "I'm getting a bit tired of her, and she's clearly just lying at this point", but it would have been perfectly reasonable for the customer to have been getting tired of you and thinking you were lying, given you claimed something could not be returned due to a clear policy on the receipt, that turned out to not be on the receipt.

Not your fault it wasn't on the receipt, not okay for her to yell at you, but even leaving aside your later comments/actions, the customer wasn't wrong to expect a return if the policy wasn't given to her.

 I don't understand how there hasn't been an immediate response from Congress to place compounding pharmacies under the auspices of the FDA, given the amount of harm NECC caused and the high possibility that it could happen with other compounding pharmacies.

This isn't to say that compounding pharmacies should have to follow all of the same requirements of manufacturingmanufacturing in large quantities poses much higher risks that what compounding pharmacies are supposed to be doing, namely creating 1 medication for 1 patient. But placing them under the umbrella of the FDA's regulation and giving the FDA the authority to inspect them, demand compounding pharmacies follow Good Manufacturing Practices, and the like should not be overly burdensome for small businesses. 









 We don't have the fraud problem of Russia, at least nowhere near the level found there, but a dash cam can still help prove one isn't at fault in an accident. 

I was at a T-intersection, where the road becomes two-lanes a few feet further on the right of the intersection, but traffic coming from the left is still one lane. A car to the left stopped and waved for me to go (since the traffic light a block up on the right was red). After checking for traffic coming from the right, I started to make my left turn at the T intersection, only to have a bumper-to-bumper strike on a car that went around the car that stopped for me on the left (slightly going over the double-yellow to pass). Neither of us could see the other based on lines of sight until getting past the stopped car where we collided.

Unfortunately, the only car that stopped was the one that hit me, not the person who stopped to let me in, and the driver of that car claimed to not have noticed passing a car.

Since I couldn't prove the other car was there and the other driver couldn't prove it wasn't, and since we had the same insurance company, the insurance co. said it was assigning fault equally. Not much damage to either car, scratches to the paint, really, but I'm still ticked off about this one.

Had I had a dash cam, I could have proven I was not at fault.

In the event of more serious incident, a dash cam can definitely be useful. 




 You have GOT to be kidding. Palestinians are NOT Israeli Muslims. One can argue about whether there is a distinct Palestinian identity or whether Palestinians are displaced Jordanians, but nobody credible on any side of the argument defines Palestinians as Israeli Muslims. 




 Employers can generally monitor company email at all times, but there ARE exceptions. If there is a published policy in place stating that the employer will not snoop in email except in certain circumstances, said employer cannot snoop in email except in certain circumstances.

All the comments here saying variants of "it's their server, they can do as they please" misses the issue. The issue is whether or not the deans in question fall into the category of faculty or not. If they are not faculty, then yes, the general staff policy allows Harvard to do as it pleases. If they are faculty, however, and there seems to be a strong case to be made that they are, the faculty policy seems to prohibits Harvard from taking the actions it did. 




 Um, it's almost certainly not the IT Department's policy, it's likely the law. 




 Dawww.... Very sweet looking. 




 Good grief-in my jurisdiction, removing a shopping cart from a store's property is a crime carrying a $25 fine, and there's legislation pending that would raise the fine to $100. 

I'm amazed the EC was stupid enough to complain that the carts she swiped were accumulating, and for that matter, I'd even be appalled if she was complaining that other people caused the accumulation. 




 Wow. I am impressed! (And my apologies for suggesting you erred.)

On the other hand, according to a 2008 article in the British Medical Journal, many "allergies" are actually a manifestation of mass psychogenic illness (AKA epidemic hysteria). http://christakis.med.harvard.edu/pdf/publications/misc/023.pdf If this article is accurate, it makes sense for food allergies to come in waves. 




 What is the process for writing the Rachel Maddow Show? What is the blend of direction from you versus from producers versus what your staff comes up with? What is the process for becoming a staff member? 




 It's state specific. In Massachusetts, some vehicle-related offenses are criminal, and some are Civil Motor Vehicle Infractions. See http://www.mass.gov/courts/courtsandjudges/courts/districtcourt/faq/faqs-cmvi.html#1 . 




 I disagree. The difference might be meaningful if judicial review down the line gave further process, such as a right to a de novo hearing somwhere along the way. It didn't. And so it creates a fiscal balance for due process in the civil arena, and not just in the administrative law arena. 




 Many, even most of the characteristics of a criminal charge? Sure. But it is still a civil violation, and therein lies all the difference in the world.

It's a civil matter, and just as in other civil contexts, there can be a filing fee. The state never pays a filing fee, but it's not exactly the initiator. (Not that it would matter if they were. To quote Mel Brooks, "It's good to be the King." The State doesn't pay filing fees. And why would it? Who would collect it? The State!) Anyhow, the initiating party, when it comes to this review process, is the person with a ticketit's an appeal.

How is Matthews on point? Because of the language I cited. The Massachusetts judicial system was (and is) underfunded, and the courts responded by putting a fee in place, both to raise revenue and cut down the amount of appeals. Unfair? Absolutely. Contrary to due process? I'd say so, but the Supreme Court doesn'tTHAT is the point of Matthews. Conserving scarce fiscal and administrative resources and balancing harm suffered to individuals versus the cost of providing due process.  




 Almost certainly not. Woman who received the package did not realize the package was misdelivered until after she opened it. Moreover, she did not lie about possessing it. She said she didn't have the package and she no longer had the package, both true statementsthe police had already come and taken it. 




 Violates ABA standards and the school could theoretically be penalized if it fails to penalize Cody Wilson. I doubt anything will come of it, but it was pretty stupid of Mr. Wilson to admit his skipping classes on the record. 




 I agree that it seems remarkedly unfair. Hell, it IS remarkedly unfair. But it's constitutional.

Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), is a Supreme Court case that discusses the impact of finances in due process. The Court essentially comes out and admits that fairness and process can have a price tag attached. 

The Court says, "Financial cost alone is not a controlling weight in determining whether due process requires a particular procedural safeguard prior to some administrative decision. But the Government's interest, and hence that of the public, in conserving scarce fiscal and administrative resources is a factor that must be weighed. At some point, the benefit of an additional safeguard to the individual affected by the administrative action and to society in terms of increased assurance that the action is just may be outweighed by the cost."

(Before I get blasted or downvoted for laying this out, please note that I disagree with Matthews v. Eldridge, and I disagree that entry-level appeals of tickets to a clerk-magistrate should involve a non-refundable fee, but sadly, nobody in power asked me. :P) 




 Even if someone legitimately has a seizure-how does that translate to free food? You call 911, they check him out, take him to the hospital if need be, etc., where does free food come into the picture?

 Not necessarily. It really is a state-specific analysis. 




 Board of Education v. Earls (2002). Reading the majority opinion alone, it may not seem terrible, but compare the reasoning with that of its predecessor, Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton, which the majority supposedly relied on as precedent, and you'll see how the Court completely ignores all the key factors that made warrantless, suspicionless drug testing okay in Vernonia.

In Vernonia, the school had a real problem with drugs, limited the testing to student athletes who had unique safety concerns given the potential harm drugs could do to students with that level of exertion, involved a population that already was used to a lesser degree of privacy due to situations involving communal nudity (i.e. locker rooms) (and yes, this is a dumb argument in my view but still, not mere dicta to be ignored in future rulings the way the Court did in Earls!), etc.

Compare that reasoning, which the Court claims to rely to Earls, with the situation in Earls. In Earls, the school did NOT have a serious drug problem, it involved students involved in any extracurricular (and it's hard making a plausible argument that students in show choir or on a chess team present an elevated safety risk), and the unique lesser expectations of privacy of people used to locker room situations did not exist.

Instead, the Court took a South Park's Mr. Mackayian view of the situation, said "Drugs are bad, mmkay", and handwaved their way past precedent. O'Connor said as much in her dissent in Earls. (Well, minus the South Park reference.) 




 Yeesh. Glad to hear things worked out for you! I admire your restraint.

 What's really scary is that the way you were treated is pretty much standard operating procedure, and its why false confessions can be such a big problem for the criminal justice system.

Put teens, or those with some form of mental issues, or even just scared adults in an interrogation room for many, many hours (sometimes double-digits), with police officers lying about what they know, intentionally or unintentionally coaching suspects with what the "right" answer, saying "just admit ____ and we can all go home", etc., and you end up with people falsely confessing to homicides, rapes, pretty much you name it. 




 I have the same set and I really like them. Cook's Illustrated rated them highly-it's why I bought them.

When I was a JD student between '05-'08, the school was still majority PC but barely. Now that I'm back as an LL.M. student, I was surprised that the vast majority of laptops are macs. At least 70%ish. 




 A Restaurant Opportunities Centers United Report, admittedly a biased source but most sources are, claims that employers frequently fail to actually pay out more than $2.13 when tips are not high enough to bring an hourly wage to at least $7.25. (ROC-United, Behind the Kitchen Door: A Multi-Site Study of the Nations Restaurant Industry (BKD), 2011.) http://rocunited.org/2011-behind-the-kitchen-door-multi-site-study/ ) 




 Ad hominem attacks are not helpful, and your assumption that people tip at a constant 15% is a rather large assumption. Plenty of people don't tip-see http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/tipped-workers-left-out-as-minimum-wage-rises/ where a bartender talks about foreign tourists unaware of the custom.

Many servers DO make more than the $7.25 minimum wage. Many make at least around the $7.25 minimum wage. And a more useful point to make, which I should have conceded in my first post, is that the $2.13 wage is allowed only if tips bring up the total wage to at least the $7.25 minimum wage. BUT-reports claim that employers frequently fail to actually pay out more than $2.13 when tips are not high enough to bring an hourly wage to at least $7.25. (see ROC-United, Behind the Kitchen Door: A Multi-Site Study of the Nations Restaurant Industry (BKD), 2011.) http://rocunited.org/2011-behind-the-kitchen-door-multi-site-study/

Tipped workers are often forced to participate in a shared-tip pool, bringing down their total earnings, sometimes below $7.25 an hour. 

Restaurants with policies that make servers responsible for dine and dashers or for meals sent back can also reduce wages below $7.25 an hour.

The low minimum wage for tipped workers is one more reason for a gender pay gap. According to http://www.nelp.org/page/-/rtmw/ROC_GenderInequity_F1.pdf?nocdn=1 , non-tipped workers (minimum wage of $7.25) are 52% mage, while tipped workers are 66% female (with sub-minimum wage of $2.13). 




 This is unconscionable. The cost of bread, milk, public transportation, gas, etc., between 1991 and 2013? Heck, I was in second grade the last time the minimum wage for tipped workers was raised. I'm now an attorney. WTF? 









 The minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13. It has stayed at $2.13 since 1991! (Since 1991, for non-tipped workers, the federal minimum wage has been raised five times and has gone from $4.25 in 1991 to $7.25.)

Think of how much bread, milk, gas, public transportation, etc. cost in 1991 versus now.

You don't have to tip for crappy service, but sequestration is NOT an excuse for not tipping. 




 Sometimes Reddit confuses me. Collective outrage at prosecuting Aaron Schwartz and cries for more exercise of prosecutorial discretion, but then in a thread like this, many suggestions that the authorities should intervene when a neighbor puts a note in another neighbor's mailbox. 




 I can't offer you legal advice, but you may want to consult with a lawyer in your jurisdiction. Generally, a false accusation of stealing is slander. 




 As _yours_truly_said, I would take a big grain of salt from the pessimistic attitude towards classmates and professors. The method can be worthwhile, as far as getting certain books and reading ahead to know the black letter bedrocks of subjects before the classes start. 




 Um, no? But if they are aware of a patron that is intoxicated to that extent, in many states, they may have certain legal duties to summon or render aid beyond placing a guy in the passenger seat of his car. 




 Fair enough. :-) 




 I can also imagine the liability if a bar did not do this and it had tragic consequences... 




 I'm a fan of personal responsibility and most of the blame falls on the dude who vomited everywhere and passed out. But. Doesn't some of the responsibility fall on the bar for overserving? (At least it would in some states.)

Also, if someone is that intoxicated, isn't a call to 911 more appropriate than dumping him in the passenger seat of his car? Alcohol poisoning can be fatal. 




 It's worth noting that according to USA Today, McMillan was indeed murdered and a person of interest is in custody. http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/02/28/gay-murder-mississippi-politics/1953187/

*edited to change word "suspect" to "person of interest"
