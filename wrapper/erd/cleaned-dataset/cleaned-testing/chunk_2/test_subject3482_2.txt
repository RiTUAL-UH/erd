 For someone of your experience, your base salary sounds about right but the bonus seems like there should be upside to that number, especially in a city like NY. Without knowing your detailed background, three potential career choices come to mind:

1. Move from a software lead to more of a technical manager / project manager role, either at a large corporation - this may not be much of a premium to your current pay but can offer you better career advancement opportunities

2. Look for a similar technical manager role at a startup (a large startup if needed to avoid overt risk). This might be at or around your base but ideally gets you meaningful stock upside, and there is the chance to handle real responsibilities and grow with the company

3. If you are ready for a bigger leap and do have some business experience / interest to go with it, try your hand at product management jobs. These take you further away from the code but give you a better chance at building a management career if you are so inclined, and therefore the long term compensation potential is better

I have curated three collections of each of these types of jobs here:

http://tapwage.com/channel/big-tech-product-manager

Good luck and if you have something else in mind, or something more specific, ping me and I can try and craft a more custom collection to give you an idea of what some of the options are.  




 yeah, it might be something like your transferable skill set isn't coming across clearly in the interviews which you can then refine with practice. Good luck.  




 Thats really odd. Do you generally send a thank you email to your interviewer (not the recruiter)? It might be worth sending them an email after the interview with a simple "I really enjoyed meeting with you. I understand that I was not the right fit for the role. Can I trouble you for 15 minutes of your time over the phone to better understand how I could prepare myself better for this role since its one that I am really keen on". Try that with a few of your interviewers and you might get some candid feedback that the recruiter is not sharing with you.  









 what types of corporate careers are you applying to?

There are a few types of careers you could consider given that you have a) people skills b) managerial skills and a history in finance

1. Get a customer experience job at a startup. 
These roles can be fascinating ways for graduates of a range of majors and backgrounds to build a career at a startup and be a part of a fast growing environment. Compared to customer service roles at more mature corporates, these are often critical roles at a startup for introducing the innovative product to a new customer base and helping customers navigate a disruptive and novel experience. These roles can be stepping stones to sales and business development careers as well as other leadership roles
Examples of such jobs are here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/hello-customer-meet-startup

2. Try and get a junior sales job at a larger corporate. Examples of such jobs are here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/rainmakers-with-benefits

3. Try and get into HR / recruiting. You probably have good people skills and these can be great roles to build a career in. A few examples of such roles are here:

Good luck and reach out if you have more specific questions 


































 Without a ton of facts, on the face of it, 45k seems reasonable at this stage. Its lower than what you would make in a bigger city but its not dramatically lower.

One easy way to check - go on a freelance site like upwork, show your portfolio and see if you are able to command  $30 / hour. (alternatively, try their HTML and CSS tests and see how you score relative to other developers there that do command  $30 / hr). That will give you a sense of whether you are underpaid or not based on your relative skills.   




 You have been here a while. First - get the offer. No point counting unhatched chickens. If you get the offer and you like the offer (better money / responsibility), take it. Try and negotiate some time before you start so you can give your current employer some notice and transition the project. But you do not owe your employer that you will stay till the end of the project.  




 If you are good at sales, stick with it, and build a bigger specialty. Ideally, find a way to navigate into enterprise sales roles (selling to large companies) because those tend to be the most lucrative. Here is a collection of such jobs so you can see the types of jobs these are and the types of skills you need to get.

Good luck! 




 One idea that you may not have thought of is looking at startups in "customer experience" roles. These are (perhaps unfortunately) customer centric roles, which I know might be a problem since you describe yourself as not a people person. However, they are really interesting because you are effectively evangelizing and helping the customer experience with a new technology, so unlike retail, its a more promising role.

Moreover, at a startup, you can break barriers, spend time learning and potentially honing your technology and design skills, and have a career path as the startup grows. Moreover, the positive can-do vibe at a startup might be a good change of pace. 

I have compiled a list of such jobs here so you can take a look and see what these jobs are like:

 It really does sound like you have had a really rough spell. If you like your job, I would stick it out. Cities grow on you, even pedestrian unfriendly ones, and it takes time to build a network of friends and a support system. There is no guarantee that if you did move, you'd love that city either (unless you find a job in a city that you think is 'home' in some sense). Moreover, finding a job is often stressful and frustrating. 

I agree that a downward move will look bad. I think moving after a few months will look bad too, and especially without a great portfolio of work to show. 

Maybe instead of spending 10 hrs a week looking for a job (which is candidly the least amount of time it typically takes), spend 10 hrs a week signing up for a class, or volunteering, or trying something new and fun that might give you the chance to meet some people and settle into the city. 

 




 Sorry I am late to this discussion.

Yours is an interesting background. A career in equity research is a good option and worth pursuing. That said, your easiest path of action is pursuing an MBA from a top 15 school. Big banks recruit at these places and you will get the finance training you need to do well at an equity research role. A CFA would be useful and you will likely need to sit for those tests anyway in an equity research capacity but I agree with the responses that say that MBA   CFA given what you are looking for. I would however, at least take CFA level 1 and 2 during your business school. 

Other finance areas you could consider where you can leverage your healthcare /  bio background is high yield research (like equity research but on bonds), and credit risk management (again a similar role but slightly easier to break into for career changers)

Pasted below is a collection of junior equity research jobs:

Take a look at these and the types of requirements that they entail and you will get a good idea of what you need for these jobs. If you have more questions - feel free to ping me on tapwage.com and we can try and be helpful. Good luck!

 









 1. I agree with TunaSandwich - better to have a job before you quit
2. I have found in my experience that sticking at your first job at least 2-3 years credentializes you. Also most jobs suck in the first year so its not unusual to not enjoy it
3. There are very few jobs out there that are going to pay 100k a year for your experience and background

Maybe look at other sales jobs: 
http://tapwage.com/channel/rainmakers-with-benefits (a collection of junior sales jobs at large companies)

http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs (collection of ad sales jobs)

Do you have an idea of what you enjoy, or are good at? Do you want to get out of sales?

If you are really smart and quantitatively driven, you could consider junior banking and finance jobs. Those pay well and are very intellectually challenging. Here is a collection of those:

Finally - I wrote an article on finding jobs you love that you might find useful:

Good luck. Reach back out if you have more specific questions.  




 There was this fantastic AskReddit from a few years ago (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l1tb5/who_actually_enjoys_their_job_what_do_you_do_what/) entitled "Who Actually Enjoys" their job. This continues to be a really popular topic and a topic that is top of mind for so many people. So we decided to summarize some of the answers there and tie them to jobs so people could easily start searching for jobs they might love too. We hope Reddit likes it.

 A few types of careers you could look at:
1. Become a recruiter. Your experience might be overlooked but its a career with advancement opportunities
A few collections of such jobs:
http://tapwage.com/channel/people-person-unicorn-edition
http://tapwage.com/channel/get-and-deliver-the-perks

2. Customer experience jobs at startups. Good place to start, and you can learn a lot and grow in your role as the company grows

3. Try to break into junior marketing roles like the ones below:
http://tapwage.com/channel/fight-night-marketers
http://tapwage.com/channel/pete-campbell-with-benefits

It will be tough but try and get an entry-level job at a large company and in general you will get the branding and the internal opportunities to grow a career. Good luck. Reach out (via the Tapwage.com site) if you have more questions  




 Try some environmental focused meet-ups or mixers. When you go to these events, try and avoid asking for a job. Just learn about what they do and bring up your experience and background. Then follow up with a linkedin message or connect after.

Have you tried connecting with people via linkedin? Even if you don't know people directly, I am guessing given your role as an ecologist, you have friends or colleagues who do and you can ask them for an introduction.

Identify the specific companies / departments you want to work for using the websites, and then find someone who know at the company (at any level and in any department) and try and have them submit it to the hiring manager/  HR from inside.  




 I forgot to add LPT pre-fix. Should I resubmit? 









 If you have an understanding of real estate and some finance experience as a loan officer, finding a role at a big real estate firm is a logical step. Look at a variety of companies like big real estate developers (rental and commercial), big data center companies that lease real estate (like digital realty), banks that do real estate financing, and also large corporations that have real estate arms.  Don't limit your choices

I run a career site (tapwage.com) focused on addressing such questions

Check out a few of these collections of jobs:
http://tapwage.com/channel/first-time-buyers (this is in real estate investing). May not be perfect for you depending on your background but gives you a flavor for some of the types of companies you can look at. 

We post new collections of jobs everyday. If you want one specific to your background, ping us on the site and we'll make a collection for you. You can also search our large database of jobs but if we make you a collection, it might be easier to find suitable stuff, especially if you aren't familiar with what types of jobs might be out there for you

 




 It will be hard. Unless you are going to get your degree at one of the top colleges like Harvard or Penn, chances are slim, and even then chances are difficult. There are other great jobs to look at. Maybe real estate finance at a local bank / financial institution. Either way - get moving while at college, try and do as many internships as you can over summers and through the school year and network hard. Good luck.

I run a career site - tapwage.com  We list a lot of banking, investing and real estate finance jobs. Check it out and see if those make sense for you

 Why are you panicking. There are a few different things you could do:

1. Look at startups. They are looking for smart people and are more open to diverse backgrounds. You could use your various skills to good use there. Maybe a data and analytics role given your programming skills, physics background and banking background:
Here is a collection of such jobs
http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-mbas-at-startups


2. Consider going to a bank looking for investment management jobs that involve programming. they re often open to physics backgrounds and great math skills. A collection of such jobs is here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/artificial-intelligence-meets-financial-intelligence

3. Consider going to a corporate and using your programming and analytical skill set. A collection of such jobs is here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-mbas-at-big-corporates

4. If nothing else, before you try for Walmart, consider going to  a startup in a customer experience role. These are interesting and your verbal and written communication skills are probably good enough for some of these roles:
http://tapwage.com/channel/hello-customer-meet-startup

Maybe do some C++ programming jobs on odesk and other sites?
