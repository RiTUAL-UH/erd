 Anything like fallout shelter to play till it comes to Android? 




 I mean ps4 has a touch pad, with possibly an unlimited possibility of buttons and functions.... Push to talk doesn't seem like that hard of thing to accomplish for the ps4, dunno about xbone. How about double tap and hold down on dpad . that could work on console 




 HORRY SHEEET , IM IN 




 It let me on earlier weird 




 But the game does work? Eu servers running smooth as butter for a lot of people.
