 Makes sense...Thanks! 




 It's not hard...I just like to leave the shirt untucked because it gets that way through the course of the day anyway. 




 I've recently tried to graduate from zippered sweatshirts to cardigans/sweaters. The problem is that I like to leave my shirts untucked.

If I do however, the part of the shirt below the sweater looks like a skirt. Is this conventionally acceptable, because I think it looks silly :-/

Should I stuff in the shirt under the sweater or something? If I tuck it in and then tuck it out later, it comes out all wrinkled. 

Any advice will be appreciated!

EDIT: Well, the internet seems to tell me that if my shirt is long enough to be looking like a skirt, it should be tucked in anyway! What do you guys think? 




 Yeah...exactly.

The last few years have taken away a lot from me. I'm prepared to spend many years getting it all back, even if I have to do it one step at a time.

Whenever you feel like you can't go on, just let a few days go by. The weather will change or a grocery store girl will smile at you...I never can tell when it begins and when it ends. When it ends, I exercise... 

Very glad to be of help... 




 I am new to this subreddit, but only because I didn't know it existed.

Reading through it gives me so much hope. 

To the people who post their problems here:

I am truly inspired today by your courage to lay your heart out on reddit and take advice. This gives me hope about me, and tells me that no matter what I'm feeling, there are always people who will care.

Thank you. 




 I tried again and again for 4 years before finally giving up on trying to be confident. After 8 months of soul-wrenching self-reflection and a reasonable amount of hurting myself, I decided the following:

I'll make a small change, and stick to it. I won't worry about any other problem. I can't work? It's okay. I can't sleep? It's okay. I am disappointing people who think the world of me? It's okay. The world sucks and the girl I love is fucking someone else? It's okay. I just turn the other cheek and let the world slap me there. I am a loser and by definition, losers don't win. That's okay too.

As long as I can exercise regularly, everything else doesn't matter. The hope is that once I'm able to exercise regularly, I can take the next step. And some days, I can't get out of my bed. That's fine too. I'll just let those days go by and wait for the day I get out and go to gym.

The point is the hope, of course. Exercise gives me endorphins and for all I know, the endorphins might be what's letting me live.

I post to r/Fitness and get encouragement from there. I see stories on reddit and I laugh. 

I'm not sure what I'm trying to say to you any more. But I went through all that you did. Maybe not or maybe my situation was worse, we can never be sure. But remember it does not matter that others think of you as a failure. 

I am afraid sometimes that my family will see me for what I am and their hopes will come crashing down. But these days, I have learned to accept that too. I am what I am. This acceptance sometimes make me smile and sometimes it makes me punch walls. 

But whatever I am, I will exercise regularly and then sleep well, and then dress well. And then we'll see. Fuck everything else.

I'm not sure I'm getting my point across at all, but I hope your understanding is better than my expression. 




 The hurting is in the front of the kneejoint, especially when I'm climbing stairs.

Thanks for your advice about the stretches. I was doing only general stretches, but will include these specific ones as well. 




 Relevant username? :D 

Okay...I guess I'll take you on your word and try! 




 I have two questions...I'm not exactly new to r/Fitness, but this seems to be the thread where I can ask basic questions freely!

1. I used to be a competitive runner about 6 years back in school (400 m, 800 m, 2000 m and 5000 m), but then I stopped. I started again a few weeks back. I run 3 times a week, 3-5 miles in each run, with an average pace of 7:30 per mile (8 mph). 

The problem is that my knees are hurting. I've just attributed it to not running for a long time, but the pain hasn't gone in 3 weeks. Is this normal or should I be worried?

2. I see squats being recommended over and over. But I don't have a partner and I am not confident of my squatting form. Will I get the same advantages if I use the squatting machine at the gym?

I'm a grad student in university, so have access to good equipment. 




 Thank you all who commented! I will be listening to all of these tomorrow.

I feel a certain finality to my actions when I listen to this. Like I'm an officer and a gentleman sitting on a chair with great poise thinking back over my life. 




 I don't have answers to any of those questions :) 




 I know...thanks :) 




 I would tend to agree with the general gist of your comment, especially the part where I'm putting in more effort than her. But changing that requires changing me, which is a lot of effort...

Well, I am going to take your advice to heart and we'll see how it goes! 




 Sort of..we're flatmates :) 




 I would like to say I don't have enough strength to do that. Circumstances too...but well! 




 No...Circumstances prevent the stopping of hanging out to this day. It's been six months now and I'm very tired now. Where are the other women?! 




 I physically proposed the act and she didn't talk to me for a day. I verbally proposed the act and she didn't talk to me for a week and even cited said physical proposal as a sign of my betrayal.

The friend zone is a lonely place. 




 "consider", not "considered", and Commic of course! 




 Also, I will be there. If you come in, and shout "Reddit!" in a loud voice, I will buy you (or the first person to do this) a beer. 




 Esquire in downtown Champaign has no cover and a live band. 




 Reading through the rest of the comments, I wish this was at the top. I believed strongly in the article till I read this comment. This goes with everything I've learned about nutrition as well. 

I wish they had done a more long term study with more gradual weight loss.
 




 "Put down the damn fork" believe me, is easier for some people than others.  




 No. I think the point is that what you call "lack of effort" is rooted in genetics. While some people use it an excuse, it is unfortunately very true for others.

I think of it in the same terms as depression. What you're doing is equating depression to a bad day. 




 Wow...Can't believe I searched the rest of reddit and missed Fitness...

*Palm sets off determined to have a few words with Face*

Thanks!! 




 ...for some people more than others, but I had no idea how wide the difference was. This article, while long, is very insightful IMO.

I see that this article has been submitted to r/science (http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/nuhrp/a_full_year_after_significant_weight_loss_these/) and health...but I subscribe more to this subreddit, and would like to see responses to this thread here. 




 I don't know...If the enemy is dropping pamphlets during a war, which government would want their people to read them?

How would it matter at all what the pamphlet said? 




 Thanks! It's (sort of) from a poem I wrote long back. Come to think of it, I think I submitted it to [/r/Poetry](/r/Poetry);

 Oh wow...I stand completely corrected!! An internet apology and thank you to you, kind sir/madam. 




 Thanks! You have now given me specific words to go find the meaning of...Off I go! 




 I did say "rest of the internet", didn't I? Google is it, and I asked.

While I showered in the torrent of information, I came out only wet, not cleaner.

It's more reliable to ask a forum where people seem to know what they're talking about. 

 




 I'm getting conflicting opinions both on this subreddit and on the rest of the internets. Some say they exercise only the arms and some say pushups are an awesome all-round bodyweight exercise.

Which is true? I have a feeling the truth lies somewhere in between...but well, I can't build my exercise routine only on feelings.

Thanks! 




 My mother is a yoga teacher, and I've heard her talk about this:

There are two different schools of Yoga (I'm not sure what either is called, so I won't take names):

1. Stretch as much as you can - This means go only to the extent you feel slight tension in and then hold that pose. Don't push yourself. You'll eventually get to the point where your heels are on the ground. 
2. Use "props" - This could be a something under your heels so that they are resting. Maybe a pillow. Anything.

I don't know for myself which is better. My mom teaches yoga the first way, so that's how I do it. You'll get better at Yoga the more you do it. 




 The study talked about cancer and heart disease. Is that all health is these days? 




 i know this is probably not the answer you're looking for, but it did work for me: Try to enjoy cooking. Look at it as part of your fitness routine. It is also a lot of fun and very interesting to try out various things.

Start with simple things and keep expanding. I used to cook once a week, and now I cook almost daily and keep trying new things. Of course, I don't make anything that takes longer than 20-30 minutes, but there's a whole world of cooking hidden in that time frame too. 




 To be fair, my mom went against her religious beliefs and out of her way to make sure we got protein through eggs in our diet. She'd never even touched eggs before in her life and still cooked it for us for breakfast.

 




 Came to say this. But then saw it said and realized I don't really like the joke. Sorry HighSorcerer!

The written word truly is different. 




 Ah..Shit! 




 I don't know. I like Sex better than Racing though. 




 That doesn't look half as bad as I thought it would. 




 How was your year? 
 




 About the reason for eating this way: I really have never considered health. My mother is a dietitian in India. She's strictly vegetarian for religious reasons, but allowed us (my brother and me) to eat eggs because she realized as sportsmen, we would not get enough protein otherwise. Come to think of it, she also used to give us Vitamin B-12 capsules regularly. She also did tell me recently that for the amount of lentils and beans we eat (approx 0.5 cups per day) plus the beans and the eggs, she was making sure that we got enough protein as kids. 

While I was not religious at all, vegetarianism stuck with me mainly out of inertia. 

When I went to Singapore once, I was out with friends and had steak and loved it. So I plunged headlong into meatland with gleeful abandon!

However, I am also a poor graduate student. So, I don't eat out very often (i.e. I cook at home) and I don't know enough about cooking meat. And meat is more expensive in grocery stores, so vegetarian it is. I started working out in earnest recently and hence this thread!

Though as I write this, I am having delicious prosciutto with fresh mozzarella and basil.

Sorry for the long reply...Am a little drunk and happy with  my cooking!

Also, thank you for the advice on supplements! I will buy some whey protein next time I visit a grocery store! 




 Thank you! This makes perfect sense! 




 Yes, I'm looking it up...

Look at this article: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/you-illuminated/201102/does-vegetarianism-make-you-dumber

Though this is about memory...Seems Creatine does not help memory in omnivores, but increases it in vegetarians! Crazy shit!

EDIT: And a similar trend for bodybuilding/exercise: http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2003issue4/vj2003issue4weight.htm

"Vegetarians have lower levels of creatine in their blood, urine, and red blood cells.21,18 This does not necessarily mean that they have lower levels in skeletal muscle, which is where it most matters during exercise. In one study, vegetarians and meat-eaters took 7 g of creatine three times a day for six days. The vegetarians' power output over three bouts of exercise improved significantly after the six days of supplementation, while it did not change for the meat-eaters.18 In another study of vegetarians, creatine supplementation did not improve power output.22

Generally, a daily total of 20-30 g of creatine, broken up in smaller doses over the course of a day and taken for five to six days, has been shown to increase performance.17 There appears to be no benefit of taking this dose for longer than six days.17 After the initial "loading" phase, 2 g/day maintains creatine levels for at least one month.17 Some researchers suggest taking creatine only every other month to maximize its effects.10" 




 I don't even know that word! But off I go to Google...Thanks! 




 I am mostly vegetarian. By mostly, I mean I eat meat only once in a while, maybe once a week and I was completely vegetarian till a year back.

I am also Indian, which for my diet means I eat a lot of vegetables, lentils and rice. I was always told my required protein comes from lentils and eggs. So I assumed I had everything required for a healthy life from a vegetarian diet.

Looking at some threads on this subreddit however, has given me the impression that I still might need supplements.

Vitamin B-12? I'd never even thought about that before, though someone said milk which I get enough of, I'm sure.

Is there anything else I should be worried about, especially since I started exercising regularly and reasonably intensely (mainly running 5 miles, rowing 2000 m and some dumbbell exercises 3-4 times a week)?
 




 Yeah, I don't want to read the logs either. I just want to have a way of knowing when I move from home to office if I've missed a message.

Chrome does that very well with the Google Talk extension.  









 I didn't realize the mistake there, and kept wondering how the first sentence and the rest were connected! 




 Yes, I have to agree...MFA is a great influence indeed! Thanks to this amazing subreddit, I'm now wearing clothes that fit, and thinking about what I'm going to wear depending on where I'm going! 




 Somehow, your amazingly weird analogy makes perfect sense! 




 In that first link, Beckham looks like he's wearing a towel :O That's supposed to look good? Even if it is, no way I have enough confidence to carry that off.

The second one's cool...

Thanks...that did help! 




 I need some guidelines on wearing a scarf. I've figured out the knots, etc. after watching a few youtube videos, and have on basic question:

Does the scarf go inside or outside the jacket?

Okay two: (How) Does the answer to the above depend on what I'm wearing? 




 Oh I had completely forgotten about the Google Talk Gadget...Thanks! 




 I really like empathy too, but I also like the ability of Google talk to automatically sync chat logs as I'm chatting between my laptop, home and office computer.

I used empathy for a few weeks before I realized that if I forget to sign off at home (which I always do), I miss everything that's said till the time I get to the office, unless I open up GMail and look in the Chats folder.

I know I'm griping about really small issues, but it would be cool if it all worked. And it seems like it should!  




 I recently switched back to Firefox because it looks and feels so much better on Gnome. 

The only thing missing is a Google Talk extension. I don't want to open up a page of GMail because I have thunderbird running all the time anyway. Chrome has a Google talk extension available that runs in the dev version with panels enabled. 

Are there any alternative solutions for Firefox? 




 Also, looking for deals on the Transformer always gets me more results on Transformer toys.  




 Oh shit, me too!  




 I did nothing all year. 




 The version on the album is more than 9 minutes long...and when listened to as part of the whole album, is a completely different listening experience. 




 This be very good advice. Going to class and doing homework not only lets you learn better, but also gives you good work ethic.

I took the easy road in undergrad, which has made my current road very thorny indeed. 




 I really can't get myself to do it. Was supposed to be coding, but here I am...I've lost my whole week :D I installed StayFocusd on Chrome and Leechblock on Firefox. The extensions lasted about two days before being disabled!

And I'm sure I'm not the only one. 

Part of the problem is that my work depends only on me and how much I can motivate myself. But I'm sure there are still solutions. 




 Yup...doing that right now! 




 That was unexpectedly pleasant! 









 So it happened again tonight as well? The power plant must be going full swing for the winter...  




 Yeah that's what I'm thinking too...But then it must be hell for the people close to there! 




 Does anyone else hear that loud continuous noise that's been on for the last hour or so? I thought it was the wind, but when I opened the balcony door, it sounded more like a big engine.

 Really? That's complicated Math? That's some of the most beautiful concepts you can find expressed in a cool, simple form...
 




 Well, Mint's numbers are higher on distrowatch, so it's a reasonably good rumor to believe.

Distrowatch numbers don't mean anything of course, so I would tend to agree with your statistics. 




 I posted this question when I was new to reddit, and didn't get any karma. It made me hate everyone. 




 I have light grey jeans...thanks! :) 




 I really thought for a moment I could pull them off! Guess it's going under shirts, then! 




 By pants, I mean jeans and Dockers Khakis... 














 Was talking to my friend in Miami who has a motorbike and complaining that I really wanted one. She said we should do a motorcycle trip. 

So in 3 days, I rented a motorcycle from Chicago, rode to the Smokies and back alone. I didn't have a jacket and I didn't have glasses (for the first seven hours before i finally gave up and bought a $5 pair at a gas station). She and friends rode from Miami and we met at the Smokies and did "The Tail of the Dragon".

My eyes were red, my skin first chilled to the bone and then burned and chapped. Best trip :D

 




 This is how I read this:

1. Oh nice, a guy got a homeless guy fried chicken.
2. What? The homeless guy was black? He got a black homeless guy fried chicken? So? 
3. Wait? *Reads the status again* He didn't say the homeless guy was black? 
 




 Are you currently a backpacker?

Yes. But never longer than 2-3 days.

 Do you know how to use your equipment well and repair it if needed?

I can use it, but can't repair it.

 Do you know basic first aid, especially for blisters?

Nope :) I guess my preparation has to point in a different way!  

Great advice on the rucksacks walks. I've done lots of hikes with heavy weights, but never trained. This is a good time to start, then.

 




 My goal is to stay healthy, and fit enough to do the Appalachian Trail in 4 months two years from now. However, I have very little knowledge of the Science of fitness and my regime is based only on personal experience of the following:

1. Playing sports all my life (Soccer mainly). I was a competitive swimmer as a kid and a member of my collegiate athletics team in India (long distance)
2. Yoga. My mother is a yoga teacher and I learnt the basics (only) from her.

This is my new fitness regime. Please criticize freely! I alternate days because I was told I should not do the same exercises on consecutive days.

** Days 1,3,5 : **
 
1/ Run 4-6 miles (It's been 6 years since I've run, so I run at the slow pace of about 8:30 per mile)

2/ Row 2000 m (in about 10 minutes) 

3/ If I feel like it, I swim a little and pay a visit to the sauna.

4/ Stretch. 

**Days 2,4,6 :** 

1/ Yoga for stretching (about 20 minutes). 

2/ Push ups (I am currently on 60 in sets of 12-15) 

3/ Sit-ups (On 70 in sets of 12-16).

Then I repeat. I use runkeeper and android apps for the pushups/situps. That's about it. Like I posted before, I have never really used gym or machines before, so any suggestions, help will be greatly appreciated!
 




 That makes perfect sense! I will try squats, deadlifts, etc.. and post again for more feedback.

Thank you! 




 I've grown up doing a variety of athletic activities and exercises, but I never really had access to a gym. 

Now I do, and what I want to know is this: 

What advantage the machines in the gym (and weights) offer over say push-ups, sit-ups and pull-ups, which I regularly do anyway. They do look like fun and I see that a lot of people are really into it, which must mean there's solid reasons for it!

 




 I'm going back now to see this girl you speak of! 




 I just saw the guy. He's pretty boring. 




 I will be dare

To be there!
 




 I am a graduate student. I live paycheck to paycheck and I currently owe my friends+brother about $6000. I make $900 or $1700 per month depending on the semester and what course I'm teaching.

Most of that money goes in rent. I have no car and don't eat out to save money, which means I've become one mean cook! 




 Ah...I see your point. So I came up with a clever line where it wasn't relevant...shit. 




 Well, independent story. I was the Instructor for an Engineering course and caught 6 Indians cheating. I am an Indian too and I cheated when I was an undergrad too. 

However, they still got zero credit for their assignments. 

**tl;dr**: Rules are rules when you have to enforce them. When you have to follow them, use your judgement! 




 I really can't believe someone's complaining that their girlfriend wants to have sex.

 I don't know why there's such a backlash against violence. You didn't mean any humiliation with your slap, only retribution. Violence, like everything else is good in moderation.

 I like ketchup on the side...not in things. 

Ketchup with fries = good

 This is only for rich people to say. 




 Okay that just made my day, night and week. Have been thinking similar things all of the last few months, but I guess Neil Gaiman just says it better.

 Just curious. I came to the first world from the third world and while I would laugh at all the silly problems "those guys" would have when I was there, I think they're all very real problems when I'm here!

Well, some of are funny, of course. But most of them seem like real first world problems to me. Is it just the fact that they're not problems in the "third" world that makes them funny? Because when I face the problem (like going to pee when I'm already asleep on a comfortable bed), I don't laugh at the fact that I didn't think this was a problem before, because it is one now!
