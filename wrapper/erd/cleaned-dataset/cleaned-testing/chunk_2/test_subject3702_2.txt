 the problem is... everyone would just assume you were homeless. Those guys are always doing zany things.  




 5? why not more? 




 why do you hate football? 




 this is very similar to me. I often just talked to myself as if I was talking to some of my friends, just imagining how they would respond. 




 yall need to see some of the veteran cooks I work with. Years and years of standing for 9+ hour shifts.... Legs turned into jelly. 




 so, it's like this. You're right in every way possible. But I still want to argue with you....





^^^^jagerbombs 




 ah, you absolutely **must** get a dog with some fune in him. 




 I thought this was a switcharoo. You failed me. 




 so true, so true. 




 hah, very close. a bit more south. 




 this. if someone is making fun of you for drinking water... I have nothing.  




 if it's freaking you out, just rinse the pasta afterwards. 




 any pharmacy, walmart or places like these. 




 okay, here's one:

I grew up in a small small town in Massachusetts and the house that my family was living in at the time had a lot  of forest behind it. I wish I could tell you how much acreage-wise, but up until I was probably 17 I used walk through the woods back there and I never hit the small road that was on the other side.

So, one of my favorite things to do was go out during January/February after a couple of good snows had fallen. All the brambles and undergrowth had died out and you could follow animal tracks forever. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a good at tracking animals or anything, it was just fun to see what animals were running around out there. I was always looking for Bobcat tracks... but anyway, I digress.

I was probably 15 at the time, I had just gotten out of school and it was this time of year and not too cold. I started out, and chose to go a way out that I had been in the summer, but it had gotten too think to move any further. So I'm walking. and walking. for probably 45mins or so, perhaps a bit longer. I stopped for a moment to get my bearings, realizing that I'd never come this far in this direction. I look around a bit, and then take few more steps forward. And then slowly, I start to hear this music. Not complex at all, it sounded like a pipe or flute. The melody was very simple, five notes total, repeating in two phrases. I was scared... mostly because encountering anybody this far out in the woods could go bad. 

So I stood there. The music just kept going, steady and not relenting. I was too afraid to go anywhere closer, but I still just wanted to listen, to see if anything happened. Finally, after about fifteen minutes of listening, my fear got the best of me and I went home. 

I was pretty upset with my self the second I got home, so I decided that the next day after school I'd go back, retrace my steps and go see what was going on. I did, and there was absolutely nothing. No footprints in the snow, no houses, nothing. Just fresh powder underneath a pine grove. 

That is the weirdest thing that's happened in my life by far. I always went back to that place to try and figure out if there was any little cabins or homeless shacks in the area. Never found anything... kind of spooky.

TLDR, I heard some weird music in the middle of the woods.   




 in watching the gif I thought they were falling to their deaths... I'm very happy they weren't.
 




 wow! that's funny! 




 interesting. Link to the study? 




 Brohonestly, you can't identify yourself on Reddit.  




 nonono, its to prevent the brim from getting oily when you touch it with your grubby hands.  




 I can verify this. 




 I actually don't mind this one so much... 




 ugh. Those shitty cheap Fedoras. Terrible, TERRIBLE I SAY! 




 damn, I'm sorry to hear that you have to drive a boat on wheels... you probably should have spent less time procrastinating in college.  




 being a 5'4" male and living anywhere, I've gotten used to this feeling. 




 nope. 




 I have seen this done on a FN show with making pancakes (or something similar) and I also once read the steps to do this in an old french cookbook:

where you separately mix egg yolks and flour together to get this yellowish paste. Then afterwards, add milk and other ingredients. Does this have a specific name? I've wanted to read about it for a while... how to do it right, what it does etc... 




 just out of curiosity, do you have any science to back up both this analogy and also the general premise that this is (a) harmful to the animal and (b) technically considered animal abuse.

If so, then shit, I've got egg on my face.
If not then

Science motherfucker, have you heard of it? 




 this comment of mine is going to get down voted. But that aside,

please just shut the fuck up. For the love of god.  




 me too man 




 you know, I agree with this. But before everyone starts to shit on me, I'd just like to explain.

All feelings are valid, in that they are phenomenally there. But some feelings/responses can be misguided. For example,

"When you go out with your friends without me, I feel like you are avoiding me and that makes me think you don't value our relationship. It would make my life better if you took me out with your friends ALL THE TIME."

now of course this is an unhealthy statement. I'm not arguing that it's not. But these are legitimate feelings that are completely off base. (Specifically I know this, because it happened to me once upon a time.)

 




 well that's funny 




 huh... I can't feel my hands today. Oh well, two Tylenol and it's off to work I go! 




 Im going to upvote you because you say wildly unpopular things on reddit. Good job. 




 I never thought of it that way. Have an upvote. 




 that might not be what he said. 




 I honestly think that it's more complicated than this. Namely, that min. wage earners are poor and need money to survive. People will do funny things to survive. 




 some people don't want to be helped. Not everyone solicits help with life decisions... This is what bothers me about smoking. There is so much literature and research that shows how harmful it is. 

I consciously don't give a shit. I smoke.  




 damn you family guy!! DAMN YOU!!! 




 you know.... I expected this. I expected it, and you delivered.  




 that is some of the most gnarly shit I've seen in a while 




 Ah, good sir, I've been had. Have some upvotes... even if people hate me in this thread. 




 Soo.. when do we get the video of this bug presented on a plate to be enjoyed for it's delicious, delicious meat dunked in butter? 




 my apologies, but what has been misspelled? 




 I think I love you 




 I am mad because you didn't draw realistic versions of people! rahrahrah! 




 oh my god get over it. have you never seen caricatures before? 




 He probably should've taken her out of there before they got to the funeral home. 




 I spit out my drink laughing so hard. I do the same shit bro 




 here, have an upboat 




 hmm... I'm fairly positive that's not chicken.  




 I'm sorry... but it is ridiculous enough to wager a guess at who might run in 2016. Four years is a political eternity. But 2024? Who the fuck knows what's going to be happening in the world, never mind who might be running for pres. 

...not that I really am that invested here. You're comment just made me giggle.   




 I wouldn't actually be that surprised. 




 agreed. My views are often pretty unpopular because of this line of thought.    




 hahaha, I can't believe you got downvoted for that. 




 dildochrist, absolve me of my sins! 




 oh you get um 




 calm down. you're on the internet. 




 It's crazy, I just watched a Google IO talk by Colt McAnlis that got me feeling really good about multiplayer html5 games. I come here, and find a course he's teaching. Today is going to be a good day. 




 agreed 




 You are fucking ridiculous! I never said that that's what I wanted to do. Stop being such a reactionary. 

I even began this whole thing with "I honestly don't **feel** so good about it." 




 It's strange, because I feel that you're the one trying to muddy the issue. I suppose it would be foolish to take this argument any further, because I can only see now that we will not reach a middle ground. 

just one thing:
it's about the fact that pornography is not a healthy basis for understanding sexuality from a biological angle and I think that 8 years old is to young to be taught about sexuality from an instructional angle.

You are upset, from what I've gathered, that he knew the distance between the holes. This seems strictly anatomical. But also remember that one hundred and fifty years ago, pinup girls would have been seen as hardcore porn, and a child seeing a girl's ankle would have been unhealthy. 

I'm not trying to muddy the issue, I'm trying to withdraw my feelings from a controversial subject in order to find some truth. It would appear that you cannot help but inject your feelings into it and conceal them as fact. 




 I mean, I honestly don't *feel* so good about it. But I'm not sure if there is really any inherent reason for this to be wrong.

For example, I would have no qualms about a 16 year old bringing an 8 year old to an art museum where there were nudes on display (painted, or otherwise). The line between what we deem as "smut" and tastefully done -- is in my mind -- nonexistent. 

Furthermore, and why I asked if you had a specific argument, is simply the question of how diegojones4 felt about the whole thing at the time. It seems like he was alright with it. And if that were the case, then quiet literally no one was harmed here.

 Is it that you feel sad because you had an innocence at that age that you would like to hold on to, and therefore it bothers you that someone else did not have that same innocence? If that's the case, then, yes spell it out. There's no reason to go on making moral arguments based on silly little feels.  




 Oh please. He was not suggesting that children have sex. Please stop using the internet. 




 is there a biological argument for your sadness? Or are you just sad for the sake of it? 




 logic! 




 A good Heineken product placement 




 wow, the water on those rocks looks great 




 My apologies mate, hope the best for you and you're kids. 




 As long as there were rules in place to prevent a pissing contest between candidate and fact-checker. It would have to be heavily moderated and have a clear format.

I would watch either way, really. The sad thing is that even with experts fact-checking in real time, people would still cling to partisan feelings and thus the debate would be spun based off of those inclinations. I have a feeling very little would be accomplished, it would just be a longer and more educational debate. But when it came down to it, people would hear what they wanted to hear and the experts would matter very little.

Actually, it would probably just prove to be a big shit show for the experts. Their careers would probably be under such scrutiny after trying to prove Mitt Romney or Barack Obama wrong that after the first one, no one would step up. 




 it must have something to do with the squirrels phone number 




 you're picture is too big and I hate it! 




 eh, you let a little affair ruin your whole marriage huh? 




 his is a common misconception. It's actually done with a long piece of string.
 




 who's that? 




 you just had that thought, eh? 




 blahblahblah wear your seatbelts.

Listen, everyone's going to get on their high horse about wearing a seatbelt. Personally, I wear one. But I dont give a godamn fuck about about what anyone else decides to do. 




 hah, I don't need a throwaway for that one. 




 innovators. 




 rawk  




 stop yar bitchn and dig in matey. 




 23 




 bout a pack a day. sometimes less. on a really ragin party night, I do mayhaps a pack in that night. But usually I want nothing to do with smoking that next day.

I am not proud of this. 




 I switch between camel filts and camel lights. 

I don't pick a lucky. My last one is always an emergency and I invariably will light it backwards.

You will look back on this post someday and think, "goddamn, why did I think smoking was so fun?" 




 go away, and never come back. 




 came here to say this.

You got to earn your red wings someday, son.
