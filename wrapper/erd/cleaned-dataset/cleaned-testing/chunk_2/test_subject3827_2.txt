 Play Monopoly 




 Nice try Plankton. 




 A long, long time ago...

There are two directions this one could take 




 Even still, we shouldn't make the assumption that this is actually what goes down in the movie. For all we know, none of it could be true. 




 Yes 




 So a crossover with two movies that involve cars and crazy stunts with lots of action would be crazy? I don't see how that couldn't work other than the time period difference... 




 Was it ever NOT gonna be a good movie? 




 Could someone please link me to the episode or clip where Rich says "mopies" instead of movies? 




 I dunno, I thought this season was a big improvement over the last few. Did you see the finale last week? It was actually pretty good! 




 I gave someone a link to something I found through an easy Google search 




 *Hello,* Newman 




 And Jewish, born in the Bronx. 




 Me too 









 Contaminated with Ebola 




 Already happened twice

 Haha 




 Space Cop

 He wasn't shoved out... 




 Well, we don't know yet if IX will be the end of the series... 




 Well, I would think Disney wants a change especially since those DVDs were made when Fox owned Lucasfilm 




 Oddjob! 




 Yeah, I'm secretly hoping the the SW7 DVD will have that same style of box art (even though it probably won't) 




 The haven't used a word like "rise" yet

I bet 

Star Wars Episode VIII: An Ancient Fear

And

Star Wars Episode IX: Dawn of the Republic or sumthin 




 "An Ancient Fear" 




 Single explosion =/= Michael Bay 




 What about Churchman: The Secret King? 




 The James Candle one? 




 It's a default sub 




 I doubt they'd call it that, they've already used the word "rogue" 




 What is this, 1857?

Did this quickly 




 I disagree, at least with them being bad. The visual effects in the prequels were ahead of their time and they hold up pretty well today. 




 What?? 




 So you ask for people's interpretations, but then you say that their arguments are invalid, despite the fact that they are based on logic? 




 My two favorites will always be Bootleg Pokemon and Takeshi's Challenge. On the other hand, I'd have to say that his earliest stuff isn't very good.

Hope that's good enough! 




 Sure - I'll get right on it 









 I would think they save it for D23 




 That's possible 




 ow my back 









 Well, he was sorta the key to all of it, he was a funnier character than they've ever had 




 I thought that was also in The Clone Wars from 2003 




 7 months from today, Star Wars The Force Awakens will be released in theaters.

When do you think we'll see another poster or teaser? 




 Haha! Women in a movie! I thought that was so hilarious!

/s 




 Oh it definitely matters how good it is. Would you rather have 1 bad movie about and influential figure or 2 movies, one of which will be excellent? 




 Yeah, but this'll be good. 




 Who cares? I think they're funny and entertaining, it doesn't make a difference to me if they aren't actually legitimate film critics. 




 Exactly! 




 So you've seen every film in existence and know for a fact that he is the only man who's ever slowed down the frame rate of a shot? 




 Source? 




 So? Seriously, what is so revolutionary about that? Did he invent some new technology? Is he the first person to ever do this? 




 So I would be praised for revolutionizing the art of film by putting a couple of slow motion shots in my movie? I know that's simplifying what Miller did by a lot, but the principle still applies. 




 But the ability to express the characters in terms of audio and visuals is unique to filmmaking. It gives you a clearer picture of who someone is and what their motivations are. 




 More so than a movie like Star Wars? Jurassic Park? Even something like Birdman? 




 For you. 




 Seriously dude?? 




 Not really 




 Some guy with a broken leg watches other people out of his window 




 Pretty good! 









 I'm on it. 




 I guess so 




 Yeah, but he said it was *a lot* deeper 




 Yeah, but don't feel intimidated by it or anything. 




 Don't generalize all of our food when you see places like McDonalds or KFC - try to find some nice, local restaurants, as a lot of them are very good. 




 I've got an amazing cable access show and I still know how to party! 




 Well, he's still aging every year  




 You mean movies that you've seen this year? 




 What's so special about the frame rate/editing compared to any of the other big budget action movies? 




 Well, no offense, but don't talk about it like its some low-budget spiritual piece of filmmaking. Don't get me wrong, it was great, but there really wasn't *that* much there in terms of story or character development. 




 Exactly - it's not about how it was made, it's about what you see on the screen. If that doesn't stand out in any way, then there's no point. 




 ok I'll be quiet 




 It made 100 million dollars this weekend. Not exactly tanking. 




 Saw **The Bridge on the River Kwai** for the first time. Loved it. 

It almost felt like the precursor to Lawrence of Arabia, such a large-scale story told beautifully. 




 Sarcasm, I hope. 




 Exactly 




 In the mud 




 What do you think a PC is? 




 Life, um, finds a way... 




 Did that comment take you 12 years to write? /s 




 Wayne's World 




 Nope. 




 http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/imitation-game/ 




 Did it take you 12 years to come up with that /s 




 Yup, that really bothered me 




 It just ends in such an anti climatic way 




 Boyhood  




 Yeah, it all felt very over dramatic 




 Oh my gosh! I was wrong 




 Sorry, got confused 




 I disagree - I really don't think anyone could've done as good of an Alec Guiness impression 




 No, I think it was shot on Arri Alexa digital cameras 




 Honestly I think James Franco could play that role pretty well 




 Seriously, why wouldn't it? It's a big budget Hollywood movie based off an already existing franchise with big names as stars. It had a decently large advertising campaign, and it's been doing incredibly well with critics. 




 I've been starvin' 'em, tazin' 'em, singing off key... 




 Can I play the piano anymore? 




 The movie will also spread through the massive ad campaign. Trust me, you guys are talking about this like its a low budget indie movie based on a completely original idea. 




 Yup 




 Sounds like it could be cool - more of a "Close Encounters" approach 




 For example, I've always wanted to see what Stanley Kubrick could've done with Lord of the Rings, or even 1984.

What movies do you wish a director had made? 




 That is all. 




 On a Thursday? Not really. Wait till the weekend is over. 




 Yeah, but that doesn't really make much sense
