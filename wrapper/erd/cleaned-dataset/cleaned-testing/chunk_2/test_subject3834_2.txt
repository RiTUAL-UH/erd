 ("My mother says conservatives only become more conservative as time goes on, because each year, they get a little further through Atlas Shrugged."*  :D

-One of the best Simpsons quotes ever, 




 You're welcome on the info thing.

Well, neither of those games play like bloodborne, and most games don't in either style, mechanics, or lore and story-telling, but they have their similarities and are quite different.  Dead Space 1 and 2 are solid survival horror games.  They follow mysterious plotlines that you have to fit together and are slowly revealed, yet even then mysterious, leaving you with many questions.  Also, the game-play is similar to Dark Souls in that it is a bit more slow and plodding and thoughtful, and it can be challenging, especially on higher difficulties, though it is standard load/save type method of doing things.


Darkest dungeon is a RNG party-based dungeon crawling game, where you recruit characters who die permanent deaths, focus on party comps and smart item usage and upgrades of your town hub, characters and armor, and it is pretty similar to the Cthulu mythos of crazed cults and mysterious dark portals and Eldritch truth.


A few others are Salt and Sanctuary - an upcoming 2d souls type game yet to be released, and Lords of The Fallen is a similar DaS style game (die and leavebloodstains, lose all your currency, focus on builds and weighty combat) was released last fall, and even though it isn't anywhere as good as DaS/BB, it is still one of the only directly DaS inspired games out there.  And of course, there are the Original Souls - Demon Souls, DaS and Das2, all worth playing, even though they are similar yet quite different from Bloodborne.


Edit:  Some other good 2D souls like games (death has consequences, risk vs reward, etc) are Rogue Legacy and Shovel Knight. 




 Right, but it depends on weapon scaling and stat investments as well, and the point remains, that there is only one in main game play through, and it sucks having to run hours of chalice dungeons or run to a whole new playthrough if you don't pick it up. 




 Takes a lot of patience - you can't get greedy or you will be killed in one shot.  I stayed at range, baiting out his charge attack (turns into a leap later on, so it changes the timing of when you have to dodge), which is easy to dodge once you know the tells and the timing, or his vomit (which he hardly ever did for me ). 


 If he vomits, and you can get to him quickly, whack his legs 3 times, and it will stun him for a moment, but make sure you don't get too greedy.


When he charges, dodge to the right and behind him, and either do one running or quick attack, and back away/dodge again, as he will quickly retaliate.  With the axe (what I think I was using), I could only get off one attack or risk being killed.


I've fought him in his weaker versions more head on which was easy, but that is the strategy I used to beat him, as I wasn't doing so hot facing him head on, as a lot of times he would charge at me even if I was close to him, and I hardly had the time or room to dodge, and it just complicated the fight too much for me, though in his last phase he hardly would want to charge me at all, so I did some very hesitant, scared shitless face-to-face combat, but I wasn't happy about it :D 




 Dude.  That shit totally reminds me of full-metal alechemist and the creation of a philosopher's stone.  All you need is a large number of hapless, terrifies souls to complete the ritual create it :D


Edit:  And the other ones who didn't get turned to stone were turned into giant lumpy, human flesh-ipedes! 




 Nope.  I don't like the blunderbuss or the cane, but the pistol is awesome and easy to parry with.  Maybe you should mix up your weapon useage and play style?  As much as I enjoy(ed) the plodding, strategic combat of DaS, I definitely think FROM did right with a change, and I find BB infinitely more fun, fluid, intense, and enjoyable when it comes to combat mechanics.  I love DaS, but BB has been a step in the right direction in terms of actual gameplay, though of course it could use more weapons and armor and etc. 




 I'm gonna be sure to leave notes in front of all the dolls and ladders now :D 




 I try to update my cloud save files like, every other day, especially if I make a lot of progress.  Don't know if PS4 automatically does this by default.  Can anyone confirm?  Either way, definately worth doing it manually every now and again to be sure, and also back it up on a USB drive maybe once every few weeks or once a month, that way, you're never totally screwed. 




 There is one blood rock you can get in the main game, and I suggest you get it before you kill gherman and get booted to NG+, as then you will miss out on it, and they are very hard to come by.  NG+ doubles everyone's hp, so a +10 weapon can definitely help you feel like you are fighting with something more than a limp bread stick :D 




 Cool, glad you took that as I intended it to be read, even though I perhaps sounded a bit dick-ish at parts.  Definately.  I liked how you bowed in the first match, even in the midst of his onslaught (also annoying that you can't cancel emotes as quickly in this game), and then you proceeded to beat him in a close match.  And cheers to older etiquete, I just find it amusing when people get mad that people don't act as they insist.  Wish this game had something more implied like red sign soap stones and arenas :/ 




 Ehh, Squid headed Cthulu-esque monsters are always a visiual cue, but often it involves eldritch (sinister/ghostly) type of truths that induce madness, and that somehow bring to light the limitations of humanity and our perceptions and understanding.  Two come readily to mind:


A newer game called Darkest Dungeon on Steam (awesome by the way, and brutal like souls/BB) is heavily influenced by Lovecraft.  Hell, even a game like deadspace (all about evolution, taking humanity to the next level based on this "alien" artifact that induces a madness that believers see as truth and growth) is very Lovecraftian, even though there aren't squid-headed monsters in it. 




 Dude, you don't even want to know it!  The Eldritch Truth will drive you mad!  MAD I SAY!!!!1! 




 Not passive aggressive, I just wanted to crush his moment of triumph and  give him a heads up that it only gets worse :) 




 Yeah - a lot of Lovecraft's focus was psychological, that is, fear of the unknown, and the limitations of human comprehension, hence so much of the focus of the game is about insight, and understanding the sinister truth and perception.  Ie., can you think of a five-sided triangle?  Or absolute zero, or nothingness?  Such things might exist, but they are truly beyond us being our comprehension. 




 You do know that's not the blood letting beast that everyone has the hardest time with, right?  :P


Nice work though! 




 Dude got wreckt, and that's cool, but why would yo ube so solipsistic in the first place?  Does everyone have to play by your rules or even the community's rules either in a game, or outside in the real world?  That shit can get you killed there too :D  Also, there's something to appreciate in how that dude just ran at you all aggressive as fuck, just like the hunter NPCs, no bull-shitting around.  None of the other hostile hunters in the game stop to bow and have tea and crumpets with you bdefore starting a fight, so why should he?


Have done lots of PvP in souls games, and honestly, who gives a shit about it in BB?  It's not like we placed down red or black soap stone signs to duel, and it's not like it's hard to inflict damage. Fighting is so fast-paced, and there are so many items and weapons to utilize for fun, that both people can use, why try and put the same honor code here?  With how long it can take to even get matches, I appreciate the longer and more drawn-out fights, so long as the invaders aren't hiding in a group of NPCs, or totally shitting on both of our time in one way or another.  Don't mean to sound like a dick, but I'm sick of people complaining about this shit or other arbitrary PvP rules, especially since BB is not the same as the Souls games, and it's the perfect game to play a sleaze ball, and use all the dirty tricks in the book, and to have fun with some intense fights, and I think putting restrictions on such a game are just limiting the full experience of the PvP  :D 




 Would it upset you if I told you I killed this guy on my level 4 beastbro run?  That poison is no joke with low vitality :D  Here are some tips.


You can parry him (when he extends his arm all the way back, pretty much as he is just shooting it forward, pow, parry+visceral.)


Save a firepaper, and your oil urns and molotov cocktails for the last phase so you can stay away from the poison, and kill him ASAP.


As others have said, if you stay to his right side, locked on, always ready to dodge, he will never hit you, but again, that poison can be brutal in that last phase.

 




 Don't they aren't definitely afraid of anything? 




 PSA:  You can use the beast claw to deflect objects, including fireballs, bullets, and even the giant rocks those fuckers throw.  You can thank me later :D 




 Plz make a bloodborne movie Disney!  PLZ! 




 Eh, but same thing goes for the rest of the souls games as well.  See Onebros :D 




 Was about to say, if you kill Rom before Amelia, it can bug out your game... 




 I know right?  Dude should get a room if he is gonna be spamming his bone, then he has the nerve to come at you before he even washes his hands?!  What an asshole! 




 Yeah, but the axe does group damage and crowd constrol so much better and easier, and somehow it's even quicker and more versatile.  You think they would have made the whip at least a bit quicker :/ 




 So what if you have deft little delicate hotdogs for fingers?  How do you have the strength to punch your hand trough a pig's ass and rip out its intestines?! 




 Can you confirm that guide/dlc thing? 




 That sounds like a fun fight.  I actually was sort of miffed by hemwick my first time through.  I mean, it was super easy, but it was sort of quiet and I didn't know what the fuck was goin on, in an anti-climactic sort of way.  Then I realized there was a little barnacle covered toad lady you had to whack, then another one, then she was dead and it was easy and I was like, how does this shit fit into the story?  0_o 




 Hahahaha.  Thanks for sharing. 




 I totally enjoy onebro runs or limited items/weapons and other challenge runs, but the tedium and insanity of barehanded and guitar hero controllers just sounds maddening!  I can already feel the frenzy meter rising just thinking about it, feeling a bit sick, but at least I can die human.... rooooAAARRr scREEEACH BLARRRRGHHHeeEeeeeRRRRRRRR RAOOOR! 




 And all those heavy trade-offs are why it's obnoxious that people even bitch and moan about in-game mechanics, items, and weapons that are clearly meant to be used, especially in PvP :D 




 Yeah, how dare people use in game items and weapons and intended mechanics.  From here on out, you are not allowed to use the rally system either!  Rally system is total CHEEZ mode!!1! 




 I'd defeat him with the sprint button :P

Last time I bothered to kill one of those assholes as a regular dungeon mob, he only dropped a bent paper-clip or something stupid like that :/ 




 Is there a cannon armed undead giant surrounded by dogs and undead with a bellmaiden nearby dropping spiders on your face?  That one has been, my, uh, favorite one so far... 




 I wear it with the crowfeather garb, as the black feathers on the bone ash set better matches the crowfeather jacket.  Looks pretty sick.  The whole vibe is a nice angel of death one :D 




 Also a heads up - make sure you run it blind with no spoilers/help/etc., as, yes, the level design is awesome, but it also hides how short and straight-forward the game truly is :/ 




 Goddammit lock ness monstah, I dun told you I aint givin you no tree'fiddy! 




 Eh, say what you will, but Dark Souls 2 was still the best game of 2014, and still gave FROM fans a bajillion hours of entertainment for both PvE and PvP, and still had the best fashion souls and PvP to date of the whole series.  BB would be closer, if not for the lousy match-making and load times and lack of multi-player options and covenants. 




 What you're describing is Dead Space, almost :D 




 U stoopid newb got reckt!

Just kidding :D

Yeah, if only we did something more useful with some of our spare time...man, the amount of souls knowledge and trivia up there is the reason I can't remember people's names anymore :) 




 That wasn't just you.  That was everyone.  DaS PvP was an economy of backstabs, and a lot of lag :D 




 There are covenants in this game?  :D 




 Being human itself allowed summons, bonfire kindling, etc, and also raised your resistances, and the humanity stat itself also increased your item discovery, aside the other affects of AR for certain weapons of ETC.


Point is, I had that thought as well (about insight doing more or being linked to idiscovery), but it would need a better balance.  In general, insight needs more of a purpose in game... 




 And then you join scientology, and they take all your echoes in tax-deductible donations, and the brain-sucker slurps out all your intelligence and free will!  Totally spot on! 




 dON'T GIVE UP SKELETON! 




 Well, I like the idea, and it would balance out since not everyone levels arcane (and honestly, the wizard stuff equivelant in this game is kinda lame anyhow, even for some extra utility and damage), but it would need to be balanced more though - like how in DaS1, your humanity raised your Idiscovery, but you risked losing it if you died... 




 Yeah, my level 4 beastbro is kickin ass and he's half way through the main game, and its pretty much like playing the whole game ond defiled cursed chalice dungeon mode, since a lot of late game enemies and most bosses kill you in one or two hits.  My main who I just like to derp around with is around level 200 or so, so who knows why the fuck he sounds so self-righteous and upset.  What else is my main supposed to do after easily aquiring all items?  Just sit on top of 2 million souls?  Nah, spend that shit.  


The most important part of a build is focus, and then the skill to use it, and a few extra levels (even 50 of them) hardly make a difference.  Anything past a level 100-120 specialized build doesn't necessarily make the game any easier anyhow, as most Bosses can still kill you in one or two hits, and the small damage bonuses are negligible, especially since an extra 10% damage doesn't mean much on a swing, when an enemy will still take two whole swings to kill anyhow. 




 Yeah, at depth 5 chalices and NG++, I find my main wandering around with a million souls fairly easily, so I've just been pumping his levels up.  Almost level 200 on him.


I have a level 4 beastbro who I will never level, and I'm also working on two separate builds I'll keep in co-op and pvp ranges.


Edit:  Also, with how wonky multiplayer is, and how tough certain chalices are, I can safely say I miss soul memory  :P 




 And the rent is too damn high!  Wait, what...? 




 Dude.  I tried the cane last night on a new character, and I got my ass handed to me over and over again at beginning of the game, and I'm in NG++ on other toons, have beaten all the lowest depth chalices, and I even am working on a Onebro challenge run.  Sure, I don't know how to play as effectively with the cane yet, but even then, the weapon just seems so lacking, namely in whip mode.  My level 4 beastbro kicks far more ass with a hunter's axe than my canebro, and onebro is in the forbidden forest, fighting much tougher enemies.  Cane just seems so whimpy, slow, and lacks damage on its whip attacks, as they have a ridiculously long wind up time, yet don't do as much damage as the kick-ass hunter's axe halberd version, nor do they stun as easily it seems.  Am I missing something here?  Or does the cane sort of suck, namely compared to other weapons that do both 1h and 2h modes better in general? 




 Right, and this is all the more reason why they need to focus and fix those issues sooner rather than later, and we know their is a match coming on the 23rd, though I don't know if that is the announced one to supposedly optimize multi-player.  I agree with a lot of your other ideas, but game balances like that can be tweaked later, after we're done yelling "Rabble rabble rabble!" about the critical-mass multi-player problems  :D


You made a good write up though.


Edit:  Also, 2nd most important, is we need covenants that matter, covenants that carry some fun interaction, risks, and rewards.  As it stands, covenants are lame as fuck and pointless in this game :( 




 I love this game, 9/10 rating from me, but there are a few huge problems in it at the moment, and they are brutally critical for a FROM game, and they definitely threaten the longevity and replayability of Bloodborne.  The biggest problems imo at the moment are the invasion system/mechanics, lack of covenants and covenant interactions/rewards, lack of even duels or an arena type system, and the wonky, undependable multi-player system in general.

Invasions - This game needs more invasions, in more areas, even if the boss is dead.  This game was not as exciting as previous titles, as there was far less risk due to a lack of player invaders.  I think bell maidens should spawn in pretty much almost every area of the game, and they should also still spawn after the boss is dead.  *I'm not even a fan of invading or invaders, but I still enjoy the mechanic, because it creates even more of a threat, and adds another delicious layer of fear, precaution, and excitement.*  I myself much prefer soapstones for dueling and arenas, and on that note:


There needs to be better, non-penalized dueling systems (ie, no -30% health penalty).  There should be bells for even-matched duels and fight clubs, as well as an arena system implemented.



Multi-player in general needs to be better, faster connections, less time-outs, and insight should not be consumed until a match is found and you are actually placed in another's player world.


There needs to be covenants in this game, along with all the risks and rewards of being in them.  Oh, there are covenants in this game?  You could have fooled me!  :D


Those are my biggest gripes for now, never mind any of the other critiques.  Still give the game a 9/10 because it is a fantastic game, but the issues that are there for the moment are very fucking glaring and unforgivable in a game like this.  I almost want to say, FROM could have or should have known and done better :(



Edit:  And yes I agree - frenzy is a goofy ass mechanic that needs some tweaking.  Bleed was cool and functional in DaS, negligble and useless in DaS2, and the equivelant in BB is just OP and WTF and kind of stupid...

 




 I don't know why a bunch of random assholes are downvoting you for no apparent reason, but you're right, it's definitely more fun than a heart attack, but not as fun as say, an aneurysm  :D 




 Create a level 4 beastbro for a challenge run?  Or some other type of chalice run?  That's the only other thing at the moment, other than what you mentioned and playing more NG cycles...  or, maybe trying new builds, or something besides quality/ludwig's.


That being said, hopefully they patch multiplayer soon...


other than what you mentionedLevel than what you mentioned and NG cycles and more chalice dungeons... 




 Yeah.  I think that's a pretty dumb way of calculating damage for viscerals... 




 How would you redo the character?  I mean, don't get me wrong. To really go for it ya really gotta use everything in your arsenal, and sometimes it's the environment, so no biggie there.  




 No summons for a true beastbro run for some, but the true deciding factor is not leveling. I managed to get Amelia on my second go, but I burned up my last 3 fire papers and used a few molotovs as well, as well as 10-15 blood vials. I'm currently getting destroyed in forbidden woods. The dogs just fart in my direction and my HP melts. Just lost 70k souls too, which is a lot. After amelia though, id recomend going to cainhurst ASAP to get blood chunks. You can at least get your weapon up to +7 or 8 if you're lucky. 


That being said, if you're around to night, I'd be willing to help u with Amelia in true Beastbro fashion, that way some higher level isn't doing the wimping for you. Let me know.  




 Yo dawg, I heard you like dreams, so we put dreams in a dream, so you could dream that your dreaming while you're dreaming about dreaming. 




 You cheesed him behind the graves and objects though :|


If we're bragging here, I beat him in one go on my first attempt with my level 4 Beastbro.  No, it was not gracious, as I had to do a lot of running and dodging in the last phase, but yes - most of his attacks will still kill you in a one to three hits with a level 4 at 10 vitality too, but don't worry, all enemies and bosses will be killing you with one shot later on in the game. 




 Welcome to Camera Souls, where the most difficult enemy you will ever fight is the camera, and he follows you into every boss battle!


(Seriously though, the camera has always been an issue in these games) 




 So this was right before he beat you to a bloody pulp with his sack of dead hookers, huh? 




 Uh, I thought Yharnam sprang up on top of the labrynth - as a result of blood healing and the further experiments with the splits in the school of thoughts from Byrgenwyrth?  Ie., Yharnam came to exist and thrive because of the blood, rather than being incidentally infected with it?
 




 Dude, after several playthroughs with a dozen other toons, for whatever reason, my mage could not make it up that one arch with the two silver archers shooting him for the life of me!  And the last time I tried, a fucking black vagrant spawned right in the middle of the arch, blocking the path, and it proceeded to 1-shot me!  Good times! 




 Well, I think the weapons they do have are pretty great, and I'd take one or two unique weapons over a whole table of 20 axes that are virtually the same (aside fashion, of course), but still, give us a few more chunks and/or rocks in each play through or whatever so we can at least play around more with the few weapons that are there :D 




 Dude.  She plays it like she's one tough crow, but really she is a super sensitive softy and she's super pissed that you didn't talk to her when she was leaning against that fence that one time... 




 Or just run straight through it all :D 




 Well. What about the 3 dozen or so baby great ones up near the upper ward and orphanage?  They all are drawn to where Ebriatis is - seemingly pining to get back to what is possibly their mother. 


Edit:  or are those Kin babies?  Like a precursor?  Because as a baby squid genuinr great one, we look muh different than the models used as ariannas baby. 


Also. By true ending they mean it is the only ending in which you truly transcend the hunt. The other two endings have u repeat it in some capacity. 
 




 Did you kill Ron the funky caterpillar?  It so, you are blocked temporarily from going back there.  




 Thanks. It's a bummer to hear they made experimentation harder in this game. Shit, I'd rather get blood stone chunks instead of mad men's knowledge :/ 




 You bet. I'm looking forward to it. Also, did you hear that they might be turning it into a movie? 




 For the chalice dungeons?  Yeah. I found a lot of the info on the spread sheets to be inaccurate or incomplete:  one dungeon had an extra rune in it, and another one said the blood rock is on level 2, but it was really on level 3. 


Or, do you mean you've found blood rocks in  each of the dungeons, and now when you try to go to a different glyph dungeon with a bloodrock supposedly inside, you find he madmen's knowledge in its stead? 




 Haha.  I'm sort of in the same boat.  I bought the PS4 as an Xmas present for myself, then played destiny for a few hours before I quit because it was a totally shit game, but then I got into the last of us, played it on and off for a few weeks, and I haven't picked it up since.  I was just thinking recently, *"I should go to youtube and finish up the rest of the story,"* as I tend to agree with you - shooters with controllers suck, and as fun as those sort of mechanics are in general, I tend to tire of them pretty quickly.  Sure, it's kinda fun to stealth around and bash peoples heads in and fight off zombies, for a bit, but then it just starts feeling redundant, and now that BB is out, I don't see myself going back to finish the game.  I'll definitely look up the rest of the story soon! 




 I took out the master race thing, and just put "PC gamer."  It's not about being better than, but if I can play a game on a machine that performs and displays the game better, I will at every chance I can get, which means I will always choose a PC unless the game is an exclusive like BB.  As for the achievements, again, I personally don't care or see the importance unless it's a challenge run (again, for the fun of the challenge, not the badge), or unless it unlocks more content or in-game items. 




 Have you played the last of us?  It's the only other game with it for PS4 (dice it's exclusive). Definitely a solid story game, a once in a generation type experience.  




 Are you a PC gamer?  If so, that is probably why :P


I'm a PC gamer myself, so I don't get the point of it either. The only reason I really see achievements mattering is when it actually unlocks more content or gives ou ingame rewards :D


Edit: I totally get challenge runs and stuff like that, but there aren't any Cheevos in BB for completing those. They're just little badges saying you completed parts of the main PvE game.  




 Do you need red jelly?  It unlocks as a purchasable item in the insight store, but I don't know the trigger for it. 

Edit - also, you should be able to find enough in the main game to open the chalice dungeon in the first place.  




 Really?  Fuckin aye!  I've been wanting to play that game so I am super happy to hear that!  Now I feel like the Bloodborne Player is starting to pull its own weight a bit more, and maybe I can stop calling it that :)


Edit:  But when will they make a new GoW game?  




 If you have the disposable income, sure it's worth it, but if not, I'd say don't do it if it's gonna stress your wallet.  There is The Last of Us remastered for PS4, which is definitely worth checking out and a great story of a game, but so far there are no other solid exclusives, or at least, games you can't play on other systems, and most games play better on PC anyhow.  Before BB, my PS4 was basically like a fancy paper-weight.  Maybe some more exclusives will come out (and next gen god of war plz?!) to make me think more highly of PS4 :D 




 In the pre-set dungeons?  No, there are no blood rocks in those, all the way down to the final boss :/ 




 Lots of people have already completed Level 4 Beastbro runs (onebro equivelant in this game:  lowest level you can be with no leveling, though any base starter class qualifies so long as you don't level for the most part).  


I'm working on one right now, and I'm just coming up on Shadows of Yharnam after clearing Cainhurst, and I can tell you that at 10 vitality for waste of skin starter class, most enemies and bosses kill you in one shot anyhow, so I don't see a vitality of 7 being all too different  :D 




 People need to shut the fuck up and mind their own business.  It's become way too common for people to interfere and be nosy with how other parents choose to raise their children.  There are far too many incidences of people misjudging a situation (which they have no business in, in the first place), say, seeing a kid being left in a car (on a perfectly cool day) for a minute, and calling the cops on the parent, even though the parent was just running in and out of the store for a quick minute.  Or god-forbid, you see a child playing outside, and someone calls the cops just because a parent isn't hovering over them.


The point is, all you pushy, needy, helicopter parents out there need to stop turning your children into pussies.  You're fucking ruining your kids.


 




 Statistics show that most children who are abducted are kidnapped by relatives and friends of the famly.  I'm more wary of the strangers I know than the strangers I don't knot.  Stranger-danger was bull-shit hype.  Of course, shit happens, but such is life. 




 Stranger danger is bull-shit anyhow.  The majority of children are abducted by family and friends of the children.  Don't worry so much about the strangers you don't know, worry more about the ones you do know.  Of course shit happens, but that's life, and more power to the parents, but I totally get the concerns.  Alls it takes is one nosy-ass shit-head who can't mind their own business, and bam, you have family services or cops called when your children are perfectly fine.


Fuck this generation of pushy, needy, over-emotional helicopter parents.  They're only serving to weaken the species, turn little boys into little girls, turn all children into total sissies, and hindering the future of the current generations and our country. 




 Clawmark.  I often use the +30% and +20% ones.  Nothing like killing Gherman on NG+ in 4 visceral attacks.  That, and the +15 and +20% stamina ones.  For the oath runes, imo, the hunter's oath rune is the only one that doesn't suck balls.  I'm totally bummed Eileen got killed by Henryk on my level 4 beastbro run, so now I'm gonna be stuck using the shitty executioner rune :/ 




 I agree.  I feel like Micolash was a wonky version of this.  It was so... anti-climactic. 




 Dude - you saying you don't like the Bag-Lady-Cultist look?  I rocked it for awhile until I put together Bone Ash and Crowfeather sets for a reaper vibe.  Though my level 4Bro is Lemmy fucking Kilmister, so he doesn't even need fashion to be awesome. 




 It's definitely not insight.  My level 4 Beastbro had over 10 insight before killing BSB, and they definitely don't spawn until after you kill the BSB. 




 I'm pretty sure you have to find her first before you kill Father G, as later, part of her dialogue is, "So you killed father G huh?" 




 So no one is sure if we are limited to one blood rock ever for each dungeon type?  Ie., I alrready collected 3 blood rocks from each of the loran, Isz, and Pthumerian dungeons.  Does that mean I will never find a blood rock in one of those types again, even if I use different glyphs?  (The three I found were using other people's glyphs, I have yet to explore the ones I originally created myself). 




 Yes, you can get blood rocks from the lowest depths chalice dungeons.  So far I have looted an additional three blood rocks from the lowest root loran, pthumeryn (sp), and isz chalice dungeon glyphs (two from the reddit spreadsheet, and one from fextralife), though I don't know if these are limited, ie., I don't know if you are limited to one bloodrock ever per chalice root type just like you are limited to one blood rock per play through for the main game, or if you can keep running different variations of a root chalice to farm blood rocks.  Can anyone confirm?  Thanks. 




 The level design in both games was awesome, and in bloodborne, the awesome design definitely hid how straight-forward and linear the game really is, though once you learn the maps in either DaS or BB, areas that once seemed sprawling and large really aren't sprawling or large at all.  Even if you have a few wider areas, most places are enclosed between walls and pits or fairly straight-forward paths.


That being said, I thought the variations within BB were pretty great, from gothic cities to the woods, to the nightmares, to the dungeons and so forth, but I'd rather them keep it focused, rather than trying to cram in a volcano world or any other number of cool environments that might not have fit, though hey probably could have implemented a marsh for sure, and maybe a snowy area (more so than the outside of Cainhurst castle which is very small).  Still, I'd rather see it focused like bloodborne, rather than overly ambitious and thus lacking in feeling and atmosphere.  Even then, Dark Souls design suffered a bit past Anor Londo due to time constraints, and DaS2 was definitely stitched and connected together the poorest out of all the games, though the areas (often small) were still fun to explore the first time around.  



The problem is imo, Dark Souls is just one hell of a game to live up to, and it was so new and fresh and unseen in the gaming world (not including DeS here), whereas BB in all its different glory, is still sort of more of the same.  I bet if BB had been released first, and DaS came years later, we would be saying BB was better, because it made such a large impression on us, and you just can't beat nostalgia and that virgin feeling for games like this. 




 I think the statues are statues in yharnam, as they have base stands, and are very repetitive and numerous, and they are also larger than hunan size. The statues in yahr'gul do indeed look like people who were turned to stone just like pompei as they were fleeig for their lives, and this all happened when the nightmare ritual was completed after Rom's death (there are many indicators and notes in game hinting that rom is blocking communication with the great ones, ie, the lake is mud, the byrgenwyrth spider keeps the master (great ones) from us (the cultists), the spider is hiding the rituals)  nd even his name vacuous somehow indicates he is absorbing/blocking the red moon and the rituals)The rest of the people in yahr'gul look like they were fused together into massive lumps of human-flehipedes. It sort of reminds me of the way philosopher stones were created in the series fullmetal alchemist - you had to sacrifice a lot of people for that shit, and it is possible it was the same in yahr'gul.  




 I would ignore them, as the depth 3 ones are lacking in challenges and rewards IMO. By the time I completed the standard dungeon progression, I had more than enough materials to make 3-4 depth 5 glyph dungeons, and plenty of insight to buy more materials, and I quickly obtained 3 blood rocks in one day as well as the top tier of all my favorite runes. 


Edit; as for the challenge, there's nothing like fightin a cannon armed undead giant as a regular enemy that is surrounded by dogs while a bell lady sends endless waves of red asshole spiders at you :D 




 I'm just glad iframes are no longer tied to stats :D


That being said, the worst thing to me about dodging while locked on isn't the movement, but some of the terrible camera angles, especially for large enemies. Staying locked on can be super handy, especially to take advantage of openings and to put yourself in favorable positions, but I've died more to the camera angles than the actual bosses themselves :/ 




 Thanks for the ideas and tips. Going to cainhurst ASAP is a great idea. Sad to hear viscrals are out the window, but I've still been using parry for the free attack window and to ease the pressure off, but the difficulty has definitely has ramped up after Amelia. I don't think I have the patience for this shit tonight (I just died 5 times in a row in the same spot, mostly in one hits from the big axe guys). I think I'll play my main and go spill some blood in the chalice dungeons to unwind -_- 




 Did you get the bloodrock to +10 your weapon?  There is one in the main game in each playthrough.  I missed it on my first no help/spoiler/solo/blind run through, and NG+ was a bit harsh at first, and having a +9 weapon for most of it definitely sucked :D 




 My pro-tip - dodge/roll/strafe to any bosses right side, just get the timing right for their attacks, and never get greedy, and you can pretty much kill every boss in this game that way (aside the ones you should shoot to parry)...especially this asshole.  He once gave me a lot of problems and had me against a wall for a minute, but now he is trivial and I have farmed him several times, including his funky ass...sick version.  (Same method for Parl/Loran Darkbeast by the way) 




 Eh, even then, not all 5's and 6s and 10-20s are created equal.  I forget the exact way they said it was calculated...but yeah, gems in this game are kind of obnoxious :/ 




 Dude.  I've gotten a bunch of rocks from various dungeons, but I have never seen a chunk to date, and that's with running all the lowest depth dungeons and root dungeons  




 Dude.  You say that now, but when you see the new saw cleaver soaps.... 




 No parries?!  Why would you do that to yourself?! 




 Dude.  Don't get me started.  Sinh's stupid fucking 20 mile-span wonky ass hit box that one-shots you while being a mile above your head is total bull-shit   




 Did you use +flat damage gems on your weapons like raw enchants from previous titles?  Or did you use +%physical damage?  Did you experiment?  If so, which gems come out to be more total damage towards end game for Bloodbros?  Also, what were some of the most useful rune setups you found?  I have a few in mind, but I'll have to see how they play out.  Also, how dare you speak unfavorably about the Great Axe of Cheese!  It served you well!  It loves you!  It wants to make mutant alien babies with you! 




 But I thought you can't use the burial blade cuz of stat deficiencies?



Also, I have a few questions for you if ya don't mind.  It is a post of mine yet to be published that I copied/pastrad in draft form that I plan on putting up soon, once reddit stops giving me it's bullshit "you can't do that message:"



So, I just killed Vicar last night (Reindeer dog bitch ruined my no-death kill streak, then Hynrick proceeded to kill Eileen, and then me repeatedly), so I'm not too far into the game, but I was curious for the OneBros who are further in the game or who have beaten it, what has been your best option to pump up your damage, especially for visceral attacks?  For example, Even with a +3 or 4 hunter's axe with the only gems I have at around +2 or 3% physical attack, my viscerals on Heynryk were only doing around 100 damage, and that dude has a few thousand health, so I set that fight aside for later, though I'm pissed I can't get the only Oath rune worth a damn in this run-through, but I digress.



Another question in line with this is - has anyone found a build (combo of runes and gems) to really maximize visceral damage, and make it more worthwhile?  I mean, either way, it is a valuable move anyhow to buy time and avoid direct combat/damage, but I'm wondering what the end game numbers can look.



That being said, anyway, how does the damage look later on in the game with more options?  Ie, the +flat damage blood gems are pointless on say, my main high level toon with pumped STR/SKL, but for those who have come across the +flat damage gems on their onebros, do they wind up being the equivelant of Raw type enchants for your higher level weapons, and thus are better for OneBros?  I mean, I don't have any yet to calculate it myself (and no clawmark runes to pump damage either), but does anyone have the stats or info on how a +9 or +10 weapon on a OneBro looks damage-wise, specifically whether or not +% runes or +flat damage runes wind up being better?  Thanks in advance for your input, and any other tips or tricks are welcome as well. 




 Ah, ok, that explains why it seemed so wonky, as i'd double tap share to start recording, and it would seemingly then not record my next actions (ie, killing father G and cleric beast on 4Bro first attempts ) 




 Dude.  BeastBro all the way.  FourBro just doesn't sound right :D
