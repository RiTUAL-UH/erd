 Bonus points for Spinning Attacks to the Body   the Head in WTF Taekwondo.  Bonus points for aerial strikes are awarded in ITF Taekwondo. 




 As a Taekwondo practitioner, winning a US Open Champion title isn't that huge of an accomplishment.  National-Level Tournaments where you have to qualify first before competing are where it's at and to my knowledge, Rogan has no record of competing at the National Level.  Not to say that he isn't a very experienced competitor.

 Thank you.

 That said though, I've found that WTF footwork gave me great ability to get in and other, but poor lateral movement. 

- It's a common beginner tactic to slide back and forward rather than use angles.  For the more experienced fighters at my Dojang, we emphasize angles.  Most Taekwondo kicks travel down a linear line in order to reach their target so angling out at the same time as someone is about to chamber off-sets their attack and gives you time to counter-attack while they have to re-orient or reposition themselves.  Angles are quite common in higher belts but just back and forth motion is very common amongst lower belts.  We definitely practice lateral movement with ladder drills.  Ladder Drills are a staple of Taekwondo footwork training.


 I've heard that this is less of a problem now because of electronic scoring being able to register the impact of a lead leg side kick and thus score it properly. Is that right?
 

- The Side Kick is one of the most powerful kicks in all of Taekwondo, in my opinion.  However, it's hard to score on someone's Hogu or eHogu (The Chest Guard) with a Side-Kick because of the side-on stance that Taekwondo Fighters adopt.  That said, we use front-leg side kicks very often at my Dojang as a "cut kick" or an attack that intercepts someone's forward movement and keeps them at range.  The Side Kick is the longest weapon in a TKD Fighter's arsenal.  Also, practicing proper technique for the Side Kick translates into the thrusting motion at the end of a Spinning Back Kick which is very often used to counter an opponent's Roundhouse Kick.  So to answer your question - it depends on the fighter and how they train.  I've sparred with opponents that consistently rely on their straight-line side kick and I've sparred with opponents that seldom use it or never use it at all.  Haven't seen a decreasing trend in it's usage though.  But, it's important to note that I've noticed a lot of fighters don't score on the Hogu with it.  Like I said, they use it to cram or push an opponent's ongoing attack or they'll score with a high side kick to the head.

EDIT: Hopefully I answered your question somewhat. 




 "Spinning Shit" is the epitome of Taekwondo and their destructive power is what defines the style, in my opinion. 




 "You are good enough to have submitted a BJJ black belt with guillotine and americana (Lyoto Machida, Vitor Belfort)  and everything, but that does not make you a black belt."

This is true. 




 Contra? 




 Hi, friend. Thanks for calling me over here.

I would like to share some thoughts of mine regarding the Taekwondo fighter, as I, myself, also come from an Olympic Sparring background and how he could've addressed some of these issues to sufficiently prepare himself in the Kickboxing match.

**1.  Boxing**

I'm just gonna point out the obvious here and say that Yong Soo Park did not work on his boxing enough or, seemingly, at all.  He would always keep his hands down in his fighting stance which is a huge no-no in kickboxing.  Also, his lack of experience with punches attributed to his weakness by lack of experience against punches.  As you've all noticed having watched the video - he had no response to any barrage of punches.  Every time he was overwhelmed, he would clinch up (WTF TKD style clinch) to avoid getting hit until the referee broke it up.  This is a habit learned in WTF Taekwondo.  In WTF Taekwondo, whenever someone is being flurried by kicks - they usually jam and clinch until the ref breaks it up, go for a high kick from close-clinch range (Think Crescent Kick - which can be done at very close range to the head), or move back while striking simultaneously. (Think Jumping Back Kick for the last one)  Because of his lack of boxing training, Park went in fighting Taekwondo-style instead of adapting and evolving his arsenal of attacks to fit in and survive in a Kickboxing or Muay Thai environment.

**2.  Checking the Leg Kicks**

As Lawrence Kenshin has pointed out, the classic side-on stance of Taekwondo makes the fighter a smaller target and allows them to move in and out quickly to find proper range for their kicks.  This could've worked to Park's advantage... had there been no leg kicks involved.  Again, like Kenshin said, the side-on stance makes it very difficult - almost impossible, imo, to properly check leg kicks and, therefore, Park was left taking the majority of all the leg kicks Kaoklai threw.  You could see how this affected him in later rounds - the guy looked like he was about to just give up.  Especially for a style of fighting that heavily relies on kicking to attack - leg kicks crippled him.

**3.  Lack of Diverse Kicking**

In my opinion, Park did not demonstrate his [full Taekwondo arsenal](http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/31joyw/taekwondo_v_kickboxing_good_example_of_how/) during the bout.  He stuck to Mid   High-Leveled Roundhouse Kicks to, respectively, the body or the head.  Few times he threw Axe Kicks or tried to make use of a Spinning Back Kick but every time he did, from what I saw, he either missed completely or barely grazed his opponent.  You would think a Taekwondo fighter would fight to his advantage against a Thai Boxer by trying to overwhelm them with unpredictable kicks at every opportunity they can find.

**4.  Lack of Strategical Footwork**

In my experience with Olympic-Sparring Taekwondo we put a lot of time on footwork.  In-and-Out movements along with checking and feints to help us control the distance and bait out our opponent in order to trap them with whatever we choose - usually a counter-kick such as a Spinning Hook Kick which can be devastating if landed properly.  From what I've seen with Park, he didn't use any good footwork in his match with Kaoklai.  He either just stepped in to attack or stood there for Kaoklai to attack him.  This is a big reason why he couldn't use his full arsenal of Taekwondo kicks as stated in reason #3 above.  Without proper footwork to lead into various kicks, he limited himself to just throwing Roundhouse Kicks off the line - which in my opinion, did nothing to Kaoklai.  

**5. NOT using his long reach to his advantage**

Kicks give more reach than punches do and in Olympic Sparring - taller fighters tend to ward off their opponents by using their reach to their advantage by keeping them at bay with long range kicks such as front leg Side Kicks whenever their opponent tries to step in to attack.  Park did no such thing against his much smaller opponent.  At [SIX FOOT SIX or 6'6''](http://k-1sport.de/en/database/show_fighter.php?id=1112), Park was by far one of the tallest Taekwondo fighters at the time and he could of easily used the strategy I mentioned in the last sentence to his advantage - yet he didn't.



**Additional Thoughts**


It's amusing see that a National Taekwondo Champion stripped himself of the best aspects of Taekwondo sparring when integrating into Kickboxing.  In my opinion, Kaoklai made him look like a White Belt - straight up.  Coming in with mid and high Roundhouse Kicks as his only attacks with predictable footwork only made himself an easy opponent for Kaoklai.

Wrote this on a short notice but these are the obvious issues that should be addressed.  May this video be of reference to any Taekwondo fighter looking into Kickboxing.  In my opinion, to be successful in Kickboxing or Muay Thai - you cannot be a Taekwondo Fighter that trains Muay Thai; you have to be a Thai Boxer that also, in addition to their Thai training, has had solid Taekwondo training as a plus.

Like /u/Carlos13th stated above regarding TKD techniques:


All the technqiues were valid technqiues and could work under the right circumstances but you need basic striking fundamentals to set them up and use them effectively in a full contact fight. They cannot be your entire game.

EDIT: Fixed formatting.

EDIT#3: Added in reference source material for Park's height.

 I've been training with the BoB (Body Opponent Bag) in my backyard without any mats for awhile now and I've been injured a couple times falling or rolling on my ankles on the hard concrete.

 Despite whatever his true intentions are, he's been such a great mentor and family, even, to Caitlin, Cisco, and especially, Barry. While Eobard Thawne may be a genius who can easily cover his tracks and manipulates other people to his advantage, I honestly want to say that he genuinely does care about everyone in Star Labs, at least to some degree.

I'm really going to miss him giving sage advice to Barry and being a mentor and a true friend to him - even, if it's mostly all an act to get what he wants.

 To train in the ''Blue Belt'' program (Gracie Combatives) at the Gracie Academy in Beverly Hills is $130 for 4x a month and $160 for 6x a month. Each combatives class is an hour long.

How can a student expect to improve very much with only four hours of training a month?

My BJJ school is $100/month for 5 days of training/week. I definitely would not be able to afford the GA training and I know for a fact that it would take me forever to reach Blue Belt had I been limited to training for only 4x a month (due to cost).

Imo, once again, Hollywood has changed the lead Asian character to "half-white" in order to appeal to major audiences.  

Same reason why David Carradine replaced Bruce Lee as the lead role in *Kung Fu* and the original Chinese character was changed to half-white - because Hollywood cannot have an oriental face playing the lead role.

My only problem with him is he doesn't look Asian at all: https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/rush-hour-pilot-cast.jpg?w=300 h=208 crop=1 




 It just seems like an illogical thing to do since they're just dehydrating themselves in an environment where water isn't as easily accessed.

I went on a field trip to an animal research facility for a Biology class and one of the caretakers were showing us a Desert Tortoise and explained that they release their fluids when nervous or scared (which it did a total of 4 times on the Caretaker while she was holding it).

 Knifehand strikes, deep stances, back fists, etc. are incorporated in various Taegeuk Poomses. However, they are never practiced in sparring. What is the purpose in learning these various blocks and strikes in forms if we cannot apply them in live combat? 



















 Does this quote really apply to BJJ? A lot of martial artists will say that a Black Belt only demonstrates mastery over the basics. This may be true in styles of Martial Arts where you can obtain a Black Belt in 2-3 years, but in BJJ, where it can take over a decade, I believe that congratulating a BJJ Practitioner on their Black Belt and saying, "Now you know the basics!," is an insult to their hard work and dedication.

I understand the meaning of the quote is humility but I, personally, would feel that if someone ever told me that upon being promoted to Black Belt, I would feel that they're undermining my training a bit.

 And is there a reason why we don't have fights the day of weigh-ins?

 In all of the Buu Saga, Gohan transformed into a Super Saiyan 2 only once to fight against Kibito.  However, after he was ambushed and had his power drained by Spovovitch   Yamu, we never see him ascend to this level ever again.  Even in his following match against Dabura, Gohan only ascended to his first Super Saiyan state.

In Battle of the Gods, before going Ultimate, Gohan only transformed into a Super Saiyan as well, no further.

Why has Gohan neglected his ability to transform into a Super Saiyan 2, or is it rather he no longer has access to that transformation?

From what we've seen in the trailer for *Revival of F*, it doesn't look like Gohan ascends to Super Saiyan 2 either.

It's rather disappointing to see him no longer use a transformation that was so hyped up from the moment his character was introduced.  The battles against Cell   Bojack as a Super Saiyan 2 were epic.

EDIT: Downvotes? I'm new to this subreddit   I just wanted to have a little discussion... 









 Blocks like this: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/EVD-kumite-042.jpg

I've practiced them all the time in Taekwondo, Shaolin Kempo,   Karate. Down Blocks, High Blocks, Inside Blocks, Outside Blocks, Out-To-In Block, In-To-Out, Knifehand Blocks etc. are mostly used in forms or traditional "One-Step" Sparring Drills. However, we never use them as a part of sparring (expect maybe Down   High Block for Roundhouse Kicks) and I have no idea what the practicality or application of these would be in a street self-defense scenario or any kind of fighting scenario.

Are these blocks just for show? Are they practical at all?

I found a video of a TKD Instructor explaining how to use an Inside Block against a Punch but I find just moving out the way or parrying to be much more practical: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKfimAcKL5w spfreload=10

 According to Saiky Jump's June 2014 interview with Akira Toriyama:

Goku endlessly keeps getting stronger, with Super Saiyan 3 in the manga and Super Saiyan 4 in the anime; does Super Saiyan keep getting limitlessly stronger too? Might we eventually see things such as a Super Saiyan 5?!
Super Saiyan 2 and 3 are nothing more than powered-up variations of Super Saiyan. After the fight with Beerus, Goku realized that mastering his normal state and Super Saiyan would raise his level more and sap less strength, so I think he probably wont become Super Saiyan 2 or 3 any more.

Super Saiyan 2 was already hyped down in the Buu Saga in favor of Super Saiyan 3,   now we won't even get to see Super Saiyan 3 anymore? I was really disappointed that Super Saiyan 3 didn't play a big role in BoTG. I thought it was amazing as a finisher in Wrath of the Dragon. Thoughts   opinions?

I've always wanted to see Frieza's personal reaction to Goku unlocking higher levels of the Super Saiyan transformation and I'd be disappointed if Goku doesn't demonstrate his new forms in Revival of F.  I may get a lot of hate for this but I thought the Super Saiyan God transformation's appearance looked ridiculous.

Also, does anyone want to see Gohan go Super Saiyan 2 again like in the Wolrd Tournament? We can tell by BoTG that he still has the option of going either Super Saiyan or "Ultimate/Mystic." By the trailer, it looks like he goes Super Saiyan but will he ascend to Super Saiyan 2?

 




 Hi everyone, I'm test_subject387.  I lurk around a lot in this sub   I've made some posts every now and then.  
In one of my threads many people went over an argument over a hypothetical situation regarding how well Bruce Lee would do in a fight versus a modern day fighter. I might get a lot of hate for this but there were a lot of misconceptions on both sides and I just wanted to express my opinion on them. I'd be grateful if you took the time to read before expressing your opinion.  And while I'm a HUGE Bruce Lee fan, this **is not** a "why Bruce Lee is the Greatest Martial Artist of All Time" post so I tried to keep everything closer to facts rather than opinion.

**Who is Bruce Lee?**


Bruce Lee is one of, if not *the*, most well-known martial artists of all time. He is famous for his short film career which left a global impact on the world, especially with *Enter the Dragon* being the first Hollywood produced Kung-Fu flick. 

**So, he's just an action star?**


Aside from being a kickass movie star, Bruce Lee was a father, a husband, a dancer, and a life-long martial artist - being the founder of his own hybrid-martial art, Jeet Kune Do.

Bruce's philosophy on the martial arts for his time were considered radical. The notion of breaking out of what he considered "set styles" in order to become a complete martial artist through means of cross-training by taking what is useful   rejecting what isn't was revolutionary.  As a side note, Dana White, the President of the UFC, credits Bruce as being the "Godfather of Mixed Martial Arts."

What was unique about Bruce was that he studied various styles of martial arts, starting with Wing Chun and expanding onto Western Boxing, Jiujitsu, Savate, Judo and more. He used his knowledge to create, in his own vision, the most practical   efficient method of self-defense for street-fighting scenarios.  The hybrid martial arts style   philosophy of *Jeet Kune Do* is his legacy.

His books, "The Tao of Jeet Kune Do," "The Art of Expressing the Human Body,"   "Bruce Lee's Fighting Method" illustrated his training methods and personal fitness routine.  Bruce's ideologies on weight training and exercise focused on making his body as functional as possible for fighting - keeping himself light, flexible,   strong in order to hit fast and hard.  His personal method of fighting focused on economy of movement, for example, he favors the lead leg, southpaw stance because, in his opinion, Bruce believed that the strongest side should be the side you put forward.  The Jab, whether it be in the form of a kick or punch, is the shortest distance between you   your opponent and therefore, it should be used with your strongest side forward.

Everything should be efficient, he believed. 

His his own words, the best definition of his own interpretation of efficiency in fighting would be a glass of water. 

*"Water is the softest substance in the world, yet it can penetrate the hardest rock.  Water is also insubstantial. By that I mean you cannot grasp hold of it, you cannot punch it and hurt it."*

*"Be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend."*

tl;dr: A fighter must be fluid, ready to adapt to any opponent. 

**So you're saying the guy was a fighter? Prove it. There's no professional record of him in existence.**


I want to make it clear.  It is *obvious* that Bruce Lee was no professional fighter.  Aside from winning a High School Boxing Tournament while in Hong Kong and various alleged streetfights, there is no existing fighting record regarding Bruce Lee.  Also, other than demonstration footage and low quality training footage, there is not very much visual evidence to cite his level of skill.  

However, the man trained his entire life to be the most efficient fighter he can possibly be - always reaching to surpass his limits.  As Linda Lee stated in the documentary, *"I Am Bruce Lee,"* Bruce would always play flipped footage of Muhammed Ali (because Lee is a Southpaw) and analyze his movements hoping to fight him one day.  While it sounds ridiculous to compare Lee to professional champions past   present, it just goes to show that Lee would have taken any challenge thrown at him.  The man was not afraid to prove himself.  So was he a professional fighter?  Not by any means but does this mean he wasn't a fighter?  I'll leave it up to you with this analogy: If you practice martial arts but never compete, are you still considered a fighter?

**How do you think Bruce Lee would do in the Modern MMA world?**

Bruce Lee was a complete martial artist.  He studied various styles of striking along with grappling as evidenced in his illustrations and notes printed in *"The Tao of Jeet Kune Do."* Bruce's philosophies of taking what is useful   rejecting what isn't when regarding cross-training is the underlying definition of what MMA is.  However, MMA is a sport that has evolved through hundreds of bouts.  In order to be a good MMA Fighter, one must train under the rulesets of the sport to maximize what they can do in the cage.

Simply put, while having trained in and mixed various styles of martial arts, Bruce Lee is not an "MMA" Fighter.  Modern Mixed Martial Arts is the epitome of how martial arts have evolved over time to the highest level suited for the cage and, as stated earlier, Bruce Lee wasn't training for that kind of environment.

It's still fun though to speculate how Bruce would've done against modern fighters in and out of his would-be weight division, but at the end of the day, Bruce wasn't training for a competition-style environment.


**You still haven't answered the question, would Bruce Lee do well in the UFC?**

In today's UFC roster with the skills   knowledge he had before his death? Probably not. The sport has evolved into a mix of striking and grappling suited for the rules of the cage.  However, it would've been interesting to see how he would've done in the early UFC Tournaments where it was still style v. style.  In my opinion, Bruce's diverse arsenal of techniques would've taken him far in those early tournaments. 

**In Conclusion?**


Bruce Lee isn't some sort of unbeatable God of a fighter or anything along those lines nor did he claim himself to be.  He was, however, a highly-respected martial artist that was ahead of his time, the founder of Jeet Kune Do, an international movie star, and a family man.

**Anything else?**

I wanted to repost an old comment of mine from /r/mma where there was a argument that Bruce was just an actor and nothing else.  While it repeats some of the things I've stated above, it also goes into detail on some of the topics I touched on.  It has to do a lot with Bruce's *actual fighting style* as opposed to what we've seen on-screen in the movies.  Regarding that subject here is my personal opinion on it:

A lot of people on /r/MMA will claim that Bruce Lee was an actor and nothing else, which is inaccurate. Bruce, before anything else, was a Martial Artist. The techniques and philosophies that he trained in and preached were definitely revolutionary for his time. The ideas of taking what is useful and rejecting what isn't, how styles are a crystallization, and to be a complete martial artist - one must cover all their bases were ingenious and are what Modern MMA Fighters apply today.
A lot of people will say Bruce was a flashy fighter, but what they don't realize is his on-screen style is completely different from what he preaches for fighting. He just knew what would look nice on camera, and obviously what looks nice on camera may be less than applicable in real, live fighting.
Bruce's fighting style emphasized economy of movement. His books, "The Tao of Jeet Kune Do" and "Bruce Lee's Fighting Method," which explains his ideas regarding fighting, are very scientific. His concepts were very unique, for example, he puts his strong side forward instead of back because he believes that the lead leg and the lead hand should be your strongest side for it covers the least amount of distance required to reach your opponent.
A "signature" move in a lot of his movies is the Spinning Heel Kick, AKA "Dragon Whips His Tail." However, in his book, "Bruce Lee's Fighting Method," he claims that the technique is too high risk in order to rely on and favors the Turning Back Kick when regarding kicks. The Turning Back Kick is now a common move taught in Muay Thai striking for MMA Fighters and many fighters have utilized it in their fighting career. It really shows how he favors realism, applicability, and practicality over flashy theatrics when it comes to real fighting. Not to say flashy moves do not work, we've seen plenty of instances where "spinning shit" ends in knockouts, but they're risky moves and Bruce favored what was more reliable.
What's ironic is Bruce actually preferred low kicks to high kicks because they're easier to land and you have more targets: the kneecap, the groin, the solar plexus, the liver, etc.
Also, regarding grappling which is a staple of MMA, Bruce's book shows that he had researched Judo and Jiu-Jitsu and the illustrations in the book portray various submissions such as chokeholds and armbars along with throws.

Had the urge to write this on a short notice, sorry if it's sloppy. 









 Aside from all these crazy memes, I've heard people say he's a World Karate Champion or something along those lines and that's how Bruce Lee came into contact with him but I've never seen anyone post any actual sparring footage or competition footage of him fighting. Is Chuck Norris legit? Anyone seen any good videos of him fighting? (No movies) 









 I noticed that my flexibility is compromised especially the day after the day I do squats (I try to go as deep as possible without compromising form). My legs are sore, I'm slower, I'm stiff and it takes a lot more effort to kick high and even when I try I don't think I can kick high as I can prior to leg day.

A lot of the guys at my gym have a rule that they don't lift any weights the week of competition to avoid any type of lagging soreness and I think I'm going to adopt that rule. 

How would you stop weightlifting from compromising your flexibility and freedom of movement?

I'm currently doing Stronglifts 5x5 for my weightlifting regime which focuses on full body workouts based on major compound exercises such as Squat, Deadlift,   Bench Press.

 Where he fights a guy who predominantly uses consecutive chains of punches, Chan just slaps or parries them out of the way until he can find an opening. 

What style of Martial Art practices that? I noticed it's used a lot in Chan's modern Kung Fu-oriented films as well as other martial arts genre movies.

I know boxers practice parries, but nothing to that level.

Also, is this a real technique or is it just for show?

I don't think it's Wing Chun, though the description sounds like it is.

He also uses various "Traditional" Martial Arts blocks against punches, the kind of blocks you see in a form.

I've always been impressed by how inventive Chan uses those blocks in the choreography of his movies and wondered if those blocks would actually work in a real fight.

On a short notice, I can't find an incredible sequence from him but I managed to pull this short scene out of Supercop. It demonstrates the traditional martial arts blocks I talked about earlier and the hand slap blocks early in the clip.

 I know there's many BJJ schools out there without Black Belt instructors. In those cases, the instructor may be a Brown Belt training for his Black.

Are Brown Belts allowed to promote their students? Is there a minimum belt ranking you have to be to have students and promote them?
