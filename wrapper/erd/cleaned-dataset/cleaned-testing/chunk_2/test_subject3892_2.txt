 Not many meals slipped free of Gerards sweaty palms. His sausage-like fingers barely grasped food long enough before his yellowed teeth ground down the substance that only further added to the padding surrounding his innards.
In laymans terms, Gerard was fat. Ghastly overweight. A bubbling heap of gastric swelling asterisked by jelly rolls for arms, vats of bacon grease for legs and a cherry on top that left one wondering where the neck ended and the head began.
Yes, Gerard was a sight for sore eyes  in life. Now in death  or the suspended state of animation hanging somewhere between the grips of life and death  Gerards presence was no worse for wares. 

It happened innocently enough. Two weeks ago Gerard, or G, as he was commonly known to those close to him, was working the night shift at the security desk of the Center for Disease control in Atlanta. On one hand it made perfect sense: the CDC was fortified to the hilt, yet still someone had to remain on hand in the event an elevator shut down, emergency services had to be called or, simply, just to keep an eye on the janitorial staff. G, never one to sit for long in public without snoring as if he were sound asleep or sweating like a suspect in an interrogation room, was the obvious first choice the night shift. Out of sight, out of mind. Thats was the best way to utilize a man who tipped the scales at close to 350 pounds.

On this particular night, G sat uncomfortably in his chair  after all, outside of beanbags and moo moos, its certainly hard for a man of his stature to get comfortable anywhere else  racking up heap after heap of chicken bones as he watched reruns of Golden Girls. Each soda only added another exclamation point to an already devastating health report filled with warnings of high triglyceride counts, diabetic concerns and an array of heart conditions.

Blanche always did it for Gerard, and his greasy chicken-covered hands began to move south of the equator as he twisted his neck from side to side as a precautionary glance for any oncoming threats. Seeing none, G chuckled to himself knowing full well only one thing would be coming tonight.

As his right hand rubbed the outside of his pants and gently stirred the sad excuse for a penis nestled deep, deep beneath his waist line, Gerards eyes remained locked on Blanche. Every cut to Sophia brought a hint of guilt, akin to that of a man with deeply-rooted grandma issues. But the slightest of jump cuts to Blanche got his genital neurons roaring again. Thank you for being a friend, Blanche. Thank you indeed.

All the while as Gs hand continues to awaken the overweight dragon below, Larry, the CDCs Master of Janitorial Arts waited for the perfect time to slip out of the shadows and walk his way past the front desk. In his pocket was the vile of Virus H1-93-D, his easy pay day and quick ticket out of the sordid South. From there all he would need to do was meet his buyer at the Greyhound station, make the exchange, and be well on his merry way. Hed played the scenario out in his head countless times, but now found himself playing and replaying to the soundtrack of a masturbating whale. 

Minutes later when Gerard was complete (Did he pull a muscle or orgasm?, thought Larry), the janitor waited for the security guard to make his way to the bathroom for a clean-up in aisle one. That time never came. In fact, G sat unfazed by his actions and merely returned to chomping on legs of greasy chicken and grunting in amusement at those wacky, seasoned southerners on the TV before him.

Shit, thought Larry. Shit. Shit. Shit.

It would have to be quick and casual.

Heyyyy G, Larry said with his long, drawn-out drawl. How you been man?

Unmoved by the janitors presence, G merely waved him off and said, You know, you cant surprise me Larry. You have more keys than a gatekeeper, and that gimpy leg only further blows your cover. If this were Dungeons and Dragons, youd have totally blown your D20 roll on Move Silently. Gerard laughed again, only to himself. No one else ever found Gerards jokes to be funny or, frankly, to make any sense.

Right man, Larry said, patting down his keys that up until moments ago were at the base of his wash bucket. Nothing gets past old G.

No way, no how, Gerard proclaimed.

Aight man, Larry said. Im done for the night. Gonna head home, squeeze one out and call it a night.

Gerard glanced eerily at Larry, wondering just how long it had been since erupting in his pants and having this conversation. Long enough, thought Gerard.

OK, he finally said, turning his attention back to the screen. Ill see ya.

Larry grabbed his bucket and headed toward the exit, adjacent to the storage closet where he kept his cleaning supplies. Already he could see the wads of cash, the cocktails on tropical beaches, surrounded by beautiful women in bikinis  no, topless!  reacting lavishly to his every beckon call. What he didnt see was the greasy puddle of bones and chicken sinew waiting in the center of the tiled floor like an unavoidable trap for a hungry animal in the wild.

Larry lost his balance on his good leg and, unable to adjust on his bad one (damn you high school football!), flopped straight onto his back losing all control and slamming hard onto the floor. As if in slow motion, the vile of H1-93-D flew from his pocket and landed in a smash of glass at the foot of Gerard. 

At first G failed to register the gravity of the situation, but by the time he reacted with his sloth-like reflexes, hitting the red quarantine button that would bring down the house, as he liked to say, Larry had already escaped through the front door. 

From the outside looking in, Larry watched as the heavy-plate steel curtains crashed in around the building, locking in G and anyone else unfortunate enough to be within the confines of the CDCs downtown offices. All of Larrys hopes and dreams were dashed right before his eyes. But given the power of the virus, he was lucky to escape with his life. That is, moments before he realized that in a fit of utter hysteria he had limped so far from the facilities that he was standing in the middle of the local truck route. To this day no one knows how he didnt hear the truck coming, but it was probably all for the better. When the authorities found him the virus had obviously taken hold, but the only part of his body still moving was a twitching finger and the toes at the end of his bum leg.

Gerard on the other hand was luckier. Or perhaps unluckier, as it may seem. He lived. Or maybe he died, only to live again. Whatever the case, his reaction to quarantine the building was the correct response in that sort of situation. On that front, his training had paid off, saving the lives of countless research scientists who proved to be more valuable to humanity than Gerard would ever be. On the other hand, G became the only specimen known to display the results of an H1-93-D infection, rendering him to the state of a circus animal amidst the crowd of bewildering analysts and doctors.

G, the man who was hardly a threat to anyone but himself, now remained no threat to those around him thanks to his own quick-thinking but slow-moving actions. Ever in a zombie-like state during the overnight shifts, it was now his absolute pleasure to no longer have to exert one more iota of energy. He merely sat in a pit surrounded by glass walls separating him from the scientists, merely existing on a diet of road kill and dog food. 
 




 Why is it people so easily forget about the serviceable aspect of technology when it inconveniences them? 









 Truthfully, I don't think they're even looking for money. It's a labor of love through and through. But they do have bins if you want to drop stuff off. 




 It's broken down by subject. When you first walk in its Sports, Sci Fi, and research books. Then there's a whole room for fiction and mysteries, along with a shelf of his personal picks. In the back section they have history, world history, tech books, and sciences. Don't hold me to that exact breakdown, but all in all it's about three rooms and probably 100-150 shelves full of free books. 




 Honestly outside of checking for hours and skimming the FAQs, I didn't go into the site much. However I heard someone walking the aisles telling her friend that it was started by a guy who ran a bar.

Just checked the website now that I'm back at my desk and came across this video. Didn't realize the guy stocking the shelves was the one who started it all:

(Also, guess I just answered my own question hah) 




 Cool. Good to hear. While I have your ear, do you have any idea about the back story to the place? How it started? How it functions? These are questions my girlfriend and I were wondering as we browsed the aisles.  




 Had the pleasure of spending Valentine's Day weekend in Baltimore and, per the usual, did a search for local bookstores. I came across this awesome place called "The Book Thing." I didn't realize why it was called that until I got there. You don't buy books. You don't even trade books. You literally just walk in, browse shelves and take whatever you want, as many as you want. I left with about 10 or so, ranging from Malcolm Gladwell, Stephen King, Le Carre and Michael Crichton.

Part of me felt obligated to at least hand some stuff over in exchange, so thankfully I had about a dozen books in the trunk I was looking to donate. It's not required, but as far as I'm concerned it's a small price to pay for what is essentially one of the coolest book THINGS I've ever seen.

Has anyone ever been?

 I love the simplicity of his voice, yet the complexity of his stories. I like feeling as if he's sitting there telling me the story every time he breaks off and puts things into layman's terms (for example, in Breakfast of Champions).

I sometimes wonder if authors like Vonnegut were successful because of the times they were writing in, not so much the topics they covered. Of course, he wrote his stuff in a post WWII world and took an anti-war stance on practically every subject, but I guess what I'm really asking is, would Vonnegut be as popular as he is if he released Slaughterhouse V today? I don't know if there's really an answer to that question. Just throwing it out there as a subtopic, I suppose. 

And as a side note, there's something that has ALWAYS bothered since Vonnegut passed away, starting with the exact day in which he passed. Quite possibly one of the greatest authors of the 20th century passed away two months after Anna Nicole Smith. While the courts were still going through the "who gets custody of her kids" story, Vonnegut was demoted to a mere side note in papers and news programs at the time. Meanwhile, a news story that was two months old remained above the fold.  




 As a Penguins fan it was actually my first impression as well. It can go either way I guess. As a teammate of Letang's, you have to see it as dirty though, hence the scuffle.  




 Can't be true...right? I mean, the dude was a monster and all but 22 pounds at birth?

 When's the next library sale? 




 100% agree with your statement about his fans. Probably the only thing worse than him. 




  Wasn't it intended for children?

Yup, I do believe so. Although writing for children in the 1930s/40s, if this book is any indication, seems to be a bit more cerebral.  




 Yeah, can't say I've heard of that one. Interesting.  




 As far as trilogies go, I really liked The Strain, although I was fairly disappointed with the last book. Anyone ever read em? 




 Funny you should say. I'm actually on the very first book of the series and can't wait to tackle the next (which consequently inspired this thread). 




 If "Women" and "Tales of Ordinary Madness" are any indication, then I'd have to go with a very firm "yes." It seems like he had a lot of self-confidence issues growing up, which has been mentioned in one of the previous comments in this thread. So in an effort to maybe cover up that universal truth, he masked it with degrading comments about women and fictitious sexual interactions with them. 

I often sometimes wonder if Bukowski would've been well-renowned in any other decade outside of the 70s.  




  What's your favorite trilogy or series of books? 




 Is this based purely off his works or for more personal reasons? 




 Well, that could explain why I couldn't find CS Lewis' comment then haha. Thank you 




 My favorite critic of Tolkien is CS Lewis. Apparently the two were friends, tied together in some way through Oxford I believe. Anyways, Lewis apparently once (jokingly?) bashed Tolkien when asked to read a passage from one of the LOTR books. I can't remember the exact quote, but it was somewhere along the lines of, "This isn't about singing dwarves again, is it?" I'm trying to dig it up on Google right now but I can't seem to find it. I always found some solace in the fact that even Tolkien's friend, and another famous writer in the genre, couldn't stand his works. 




 I've actually debated whether I should consider reading more than one at a time. At times I struggle with keeping interest in one that didn't exactly pique my interest, and find that I'd rather not read at all than subject myself to it. However, I've always maintained the one rule that no matter what I have to finish a book. So, the beat goes on, however long it may take to finish.
