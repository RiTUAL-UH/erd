 Oh, hey wrestlefan!

 Could i possibly have that cobra also PSN:test_subject3919 




 An combined w/ the bee its the better sniper for bosses 




 I Just need the slag hawk now. 




 your beards made my day. 




 I dont need heads but ill dupe my inv PSN: test_subject3919 




 I already have a homing quasar, i need a LOBBED quasar, that's why i specified.

I think i ahve a friend on psn giving it to me so I'm pretty sure im good on that front. 




 sweet thx! 




 I need those for a good Invincible killing set-up. Just ask if you want a gun and I will give it to you if I have it, hell; I'll even dupe my whole inventory. PSN: test_subject3919

Edit: even a singularity w/ a low fuse time instead of the quasar will work, but preferably the quasar. 




 Thanks so much I didn't think of making a new lvl 1, don't know why but whatever. I found out you cannot trade it or drop it though so i can't give it with a second pad from my other lvl 50 axton who dose have it. 




 I just finished a playthrough to try and get all the legendary solo and before the warrior fight I sold everything I thought was garbage... including my loot relic. Is there any way to get it back? 




 God damn it dude flag it NSFW! I'm at work! 




 Ha, ours is named lucy too! 




 The Oh Baby made me smile, the name, the people bursting like water balloons when you hit them made me smile too none the less. 




 Scoliosis Extremus! 




 ONce while I was in the hospital because my appendix ruptured and I had a terrible fever, I said to my mom "MOM, The boys are eating Christmas!" 




 FALCON PUNCH! 




 it's a cat.

ORLY! 




 Just finished this map earlier today with my buddy. 




 He's most probably referring to the [band](http://www.noahandthewhale.com/). (I've got your back ronry!) 




 I use dual turrets with sheilds ad a distraction so i can keep my bee up 














 Ummmm, just so you know if you drop the head, dashboard or turn off the xbox. You keep it and they get it too, but make sure they pick it up first if they are in your game. :D that's waht duping is. 




 this post contradicts itself 



















 Day After Tomorrow GIF? 




 If you pair stuff up correctly like the bee and the sandhawk you can deal massive damage. I highly reccomend doing reaserch on legendary guns if you're into the game. 









 I'm assuming you mean DLC, and yeah, kinda short tho so be sure to take your time and not use any OP guns if you want it to last. 




 My dad was sitting at the table and I asked him if he would like some peanut butter on his toast. He replied "Yeah, put some of that green stuff on there!" We went to the eye doctor after breakfast. 




 Don't worry. jackenstine isn't what you think it is. 




 Jackenstine drops it. It's a e-tech smg with the red flair text saying "by the people, for the people" when you shoot it the bullets kind of teleport. I got rid of it because i ended up in this weird dupe-fest with a couple of guys. I'm just wondering if i should farm for it if it's any good. 




 MMM! DAT SHIRT! 









 -"I thought your name was Frank"
-"That doesn't matter, call me Greg. I have a PHD; I tell you what to do." 




 Rick, I think it's because his wife was a total cunt and I was [like](http://8th-circuit.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/500x262/feels.jpg) 




 Metal storm for the Commando, then pair that up with the shredifier. 




 sweet, I will head to my playstation now! (don't know if I can get on it though, my friends might be using it) 




 Yep I don't want anything though, PSN test_subject3919 




 I don't need any of your stuff, But ill dupe you my inv. PSN: Jaetman 




 Amanda Todd. 




 Yeah, or you can add me and I can give it to you. PSN:test_subject3919 




 You need to specify what you're playing on, lol. 




 Last time I became lucid it was because i was having a totally normal conversation with a girl i kindof like, but she was naked and I was fingering her. 




 I usually take it up my nose. That's the best way to get the substance into your system. 




 OR MONEY! 




 No, could you still dupe me it though?
 




 **I CAN USE INUENDO TOO! TONIGHT IT'S THE VAULT HUNTER VERSUS FLY BOY!!!! BLOWJOBS!!** 




 DOSEN'T HE KNOW THAT IT'S UNHEALTHY TO REMOVE A FLASHDRIVE WITHOUT EJECTING IT PROPERLY! 




 sweet, thatnks so much PSN: test_subject3919 




 Jaetman 




 I can give them to you after I get them, add me PSN:test_subject3919 




 Dude, that's awesome im jelous! 




 all I have is a caustic infinity, shock infinity, rapid infinity, and purging infinity, and I have no heads. Is there any way you could just dupe them for me? (drop them on the ground and turn the PS3 off without saving so we both keep the guns). And even before that I could just dupe my entire inventory like I said. 




 I can just give them to you. 




 I can dupe you the siren, and do you have a sweet fibber or a sweet sandhawk? 




 I have quite a few legendarys, including all legendary class mods except gunzerker, and other random shit, just ask. 




 [I'm so mature!](http://rlv.zcache.ca/thats_what_she_said_print-r79acb1096c5a46319fa318817ec8fc1c_2sor_400.jpg)
 




 To be truthful I haven't gotten into multiplayer that much either so I'd be down to do that if I have time. 




 yeah just store stuff first. 




 I'm online now i just sent you a request
 




 Dude, I'll just dupe you everything lol! 




 I'm pretty sure this one's a mural, in Montreal they have tons of huge murals on roads and buildings. I've never seen this one before but i have seen lot's. I live in the neighboring province so I have taken a few trips over, but I really don't know. 




 I can dupe you my stuff too. 




 Add me, I can dupe you and you don't need to give me anything. 




 The Incredibles!!!!!! 




 After you get it, can you dupe it for me? 




 What are you on, if ps3 i can dupe you a electric infinity, and do you have a legendary commando class mod? 




 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand no one's gonna! 




 I don't think you fully understand how this meme works...... 




 [In regards to the 4th pic](http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/314/1/6/beautiful_squidward_by_archangel_twilight-d4fsfmm.jpg) 









 I thought even writers were considerd devs. Oh well! 




 Yeah, what trippySG said, and you'll want to have a good sheild like the bee or the Impaler

The bee is dropped from: Hunter Hellquest (easier to get, he's in the arid boneyards in that building up on posts right across from spawn, and you need to do a mission to unlock the ability to fight him)
The Impaler is dropped from: the warrior

Plus a good fire SMG will kick butt, if you do the maximum tip for moxie she'll give you one, I think. The damage is usually around 4000 and the fire rate is pretty high. 




 I'll Dupe you my hellfire or hornet, and maybe you could spot me a conference call? 
PSN: test_subject3919 




 I'll trade for; it I'm cool with trading: the bee, hellfire, hornet, longbow, rolling thunder, and the Impaler for that stupid gun I cannot get to fucking drop!

Im on PS3
User: test_subject3919 




 Can I trade a Hellfire or the longbow for a Conference call? 




 *slow clap 




 Did anyone get the the ad at the bottom with Stephen Harper giving a thumbs up that just fucking made the post 999999999299999% better! 




 yeah, I think that was the original intention for her character, but not everyone took the joke that way, and if you watch the YouTube channel "hey ash; whatch playin" Ashely Burch, voices that character and it makes it a lot more enjoyable because that is a damn good YouTube channel, also her brother on the channel was a borderlands dev!   




 I never play co-op on PS3 because I don't have any friends who also play on PS3, I just recently beat it and now I'm farming legendary weapons and i have like 6, so you don't need more that one, to have fun....... I'll just let myself out........

 MOTHER FUCKING BUBBLES!!!!

 I watched a video of streaming before a bomb hit; it was just plain terriying. 




 I check to see if I can see the rim of my glasses.

 Nice job, jackass; you broke the universe! 




 you glorious bastard. 




 Exercise first, like do as many push ups you can then do one more, take a break then do sit ups in the same manner. 




 YES THEY DO! GOHHD! 




 It was really just an accident, I kinda gave up on lucid dreaming because I had some real life stuff to deal with, then never picked it back up.
_____________________________________________________________

So I was talking to a friend of mine from 5 years ago, after the conversation I walked into a high rise and took an elevator to what I think was my floor (the top pent house) went into the bathroom and brushed my teeth not paying attention to anything in the room caught in  thought about the conversation. I recalled the events of conversation noticing it was a dream. I followed the events up to where I was standing. i looked in the mirror and my hair was orange and i had lots of freckles ( I have no freckles and blond hair) I walked out of the bathroom into a room with a grand window. The a lady with a terrifying face burst through the door and rammed me out the window I managed to start fly and it lasted for what felt like 15 mins. I'm definatly going to keep try to lucid dream now! 




 God, I'm racking my brain so hard to try and remember what game this is! 




 YES YES FUCKING YESSSSSSSS 




 *kissy kiss

 Have not played ac3 but, I have enjoyed dishonored immensely. I did play ac2 but that was like "meh" (sorry ac fans D:) but I totally into dishonored. 




 Doesn't matter had sex.

 BOLO patch is kind of like a bunch of mods that you can turn on and off and any mod that gives you all black market items and a mod that extends your grappling hook 




 Every fucking fiber in my body is screaming yes, I have so many hours on that game, and if you add mods its so beautiful! 




 you sir, deserve some candy for that one!

 I just laughed so hard I violently threw my body back and forth. 




 That gave me cancer. 




 I know it's run of the mill but I'm loving borderlands 2 so much right now or if your looking for something inexpensive, Borderlands 1 game of the year edition it comes with all dlc's and has tons of actual hours of gameplay then after you beat it, you can try to get all of the super awesome guns. Plus co-op and single player are perfectly balanced.
