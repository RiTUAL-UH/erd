 there's nothing more fun than looking back at the things you made in elementary school. if you're a parent, please save all your kids stuff.  




 this is my favorite thing i've seen all week. granted, it IS Monday, but i stand by what i said.  




 yes, i totally owned that.  




 what was this from? 




 I'm still mad at my brother for throwing mine down the stairs and breaking it. I told him this recently.  




 Great work! 




 you should be a tattoo artist!  




 I have the same TV. just thought you should know.  




 i love this. a lot.  




 I just let out a big ol' "awww" at work.  




 because he invented anti-cancer.  




 this made me laugh a lot, despite the fact that 32 people were most likely killed right after.  




 she actually did a few of those as well. and the Treehouse Times. a lot of those huge mega corp books hire out other people! bastards!
