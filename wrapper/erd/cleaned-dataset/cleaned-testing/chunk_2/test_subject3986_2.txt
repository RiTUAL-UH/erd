 Wow that color looks so good on you! My only recommendation is to make sure to either line your lips with pink liner or to use a concealed pen to outline your lips so the lipstick doesn't run, because its really noticeable when bright colored lipstick is getting a bit messy  




 Super late to ask, but do you find writing with a pencil/pen hard to do?  




 If you have an instagram check out cosplayer Chloe Dykstra's instagram (@chloedykstra)! She did this AWESOME makeup for Lisa Frank about a month ago, like it was spot on!

 Hopefully mermaid will be a good substitute for kitties 3 

And welcome fellow newbie! 




 Ooh hello there! :) I think all us girls had the dreaded raccoon phase... I went through the emo phase and thought "YES MORE EYELINER IT SHOULD BE AS BLACK AS MY SOUL" but now I deeply regret that decision  




 IT is well worth the price! Honestly it covers so well I dont need concealer, but you have to buff well so the foundation doesn't appear cakey.

And about Coldstone, its just the way they're run, but mine doesn't require you to sing unless someone asks :P we're lazy! 

I cant believe youre a cosplayer, its do rare to find them!!! I've done Taiga Aisaka from Toradora! Yin from Darker than Black, Harley Quinn, and im working on a Poison Ivy now that I got my awesome green lipstick from Melt Cosmetics 3 




 I know, but it helps boredom when youre at school

 Well I have some Revlon colorstay that fits my budget, but for Christmas I have asked for an Urban Decay palette. I really really really want Vice3 but I have also heard that Naked2 is way better. I'm open to any palettes, really. I just want something super fun! 




 Thanks for the welcome! Where did you used to live? I currently live in North Carolina. 




 I'm an IT Cosmetics ADDICT! seriously! I have oily, sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts and I find that it really helps with coverage and doesn't gunk up my pores. 

As for hobbies, I'm pretty boring. I work at Coldstone Creamery and I like to cosplay whenever there's a convention, but other than that High school keeps me busy :( 




 Hey ya'll! I'm a southern girl who loves nothing but lipstick and a fierce winged liner. I've just started to experiment with eyeshadow as I'm only 17, and I really hope to improve my makeup skills. I always been fascinated with makeup (even though my middle school makeup made me look like a raccoon *cringe*) and I'm so eager to learn more tricks of the trade :)  




 For Christmas I'm asking for an Urban Decay eyeshadow palette. I've had my eyes on Vice3 for a looooong time, but I'm not sure sure its worth it. So MU addicts.... Whats your favorite and why? 




 I'd recommend Benefit's mascara They're Real!

Not only is it long lasting, but it also volumizes and lengthens your lashes the more you wear it :) 




 Me! I live near Raleigh in the Apex area :) 














 This is amazing! 




 Good idea, thank you so much for the advice! I have a somewhat similar concealer pencil by IT cosmetics and when I get Blow ill try out your tip 




 I love love love Blow! I just purchased it, but now I have no clue what to use as a lip liner. Do you have any suggestions? 




 Is Urban Decays "Vice" palette worth the buy? 




 Good job on the first haul! And I need to say that your cheeckbones are perfect! 




 Thank you so much! I usually do red lips and plain eye or winged liner and natural lips. You rock!
