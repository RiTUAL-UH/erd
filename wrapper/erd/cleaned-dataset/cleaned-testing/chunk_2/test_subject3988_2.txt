 When you say you woke up and had to recall who the people in your house were, was it as extreme as having no memory of them at all or did you just feel strange and out of place, like it only just 'clicked' that each of them were members of your family? If you had memory loss and that still happens these days then you *need* to get it checked out. If its the latter though, I still occasionally feel like I'm half in my body and half out of it and everything seems out of place. You shouldn't worry about that too much.

Life can be pretty tough, believe me I've been through some shit. When you have real overwhelming depression the very concept of changing yourself and making your life better seems like an impossible task- I'm at college too and in darker times I've had days when I could barely make it out of bed and to the fridge to feed myself, as pathetic as that sounds, but the first step to recovering from a slump is to forgive yourself for any bad choices you have made and any time you felt too weak to make a change. You didn't gain any interests as a little kid, you never had a relationship, you feel like you are not in control of your life? That's ok! The past is the past, there's not a person alive who doesn't regret not doing a few things differently. 

As well as forgiving your past mistakes you need to be fully aware that there are some things you have control over. The very fact that somewhere deep down you would *like* to change is the biggest hurdle in many ways. Depending on your circumstances and how much motivation you can find you can alter your life more slowly or quickly, just try to do something rather than nothing. The 'no zero days' post on reddit really helped me (look it up!) I found that the biggest flaw with most motivational techniques is that they can pump you up and make you want to change the world but that feeling burns out pretty damn fast. The key is baby steps, make a little change each week and stick to it. This time next year you will have completely reshaped yourself.

So what can you do? Your mood is crap, you don't like the fact you are skinny and you'd like to find yourself a girl? Working out is a pretty decent remedy for all of these things. I'm not saying you should run out of the door now and sign up at your nearest gym. Just commit to doing some exercise. Whatever you are comfortable with- 10 push ups and crunches each morning before you shower, go out for a real short run after you get up. And slowly increase this. Think about your diet too, what you put into your body makes all the difference when it comes to your mood and appearance (again, baby steps, but stick with it). Take a full body picture before you start, take it today even, and then you can always look back on it and see how far you came.

You work six days each week, that leaves the occasional day off. Do *something* with it. Its important that you rest when you can but if you want more of a social life then go for it- call up old friends, join a club, ask people if they'd like to hang out that day. Find something to live for and look forward to that day. Similarly try to structure your daily routine so you have an hour or two each night to chill out, no excuses, you work extremely hard and you deserve that.

Thirdly, take some time to find direction. It doesn't matter what it is. A job you would like to do, a business you would like to start, a home you would like to have. Anything that you could aim for that would make your life a happier one. If you don't want to be a software engineer- fine. There are literally millions of people with degrees unrelated to the field they end up excelling in. The fact that you have a degree in a respected subject will help you, and the skills you learn may well become useful later down the road. Very few people know what they truly want to do in college, don't worry about that.

For anything you absolutely can't change, just keep in mind that everything will eventually pass. You have to struggle through college with no free time? In a couple of years college will be over. All you have to do is wait, your circumstances will change and you'll have a lot of free time to fill with any wild post-college plans you make now!

You have it rough, its understandable that you feel like you have a terrible life but I believe in you. I know you are going to get better, we don't know each other but I am counting on you to do something here. Plus, you may not realize it but you have a few really great weapons in your arsenal. You are nineteen for a start, you have barely begun. You could count the number of years in which you have actually had some major decision-making-control over your life on one hand. There is so much time for you to alter your course, just start now and you can absolutely do pretty much anything you set your mind to. You still have both of your parents- I'm 21 and have no real family around me, I know that you can use them somehow, even just for a shoulder to lean on now and then. You're in college, that puts you ahead of most people educationally. You have work experience that is going to look really good on your resume. It may seem like its all just a drag but take whatever you can from every shitty experience you have.

If there's one thing I've learnt from my years with depression its that no one's life is as good as it looks to the outside world, never compare yourself to others because its very rare that anyone is willing to reveal their dark side. Hey, if you looked me up on facebook you'd probably think I have a pretty awesome life. I'm at an ivy league university, have a few pictures of me hanging out drinking with friends and spent the last summer break travelling around the world with my girlfriend. Months later my depression was triggered badly and I couldn't leave my apartment, was self harming and came close to suicide. During that time I found out that a good buddy of mine was also self harming and extremely stressed from the workload. I recently took a psychology class where we did an anonymous test for depression and eating disorders. In our ivy league class of supposedly successful students over three quarters gave results that indicated moderate to severe depression and around fifteen per cent were classed as having an eating disorder. Don't sweat. I know that you are going to come out of this a great person. If you need anything at all feel free to PM me, I'm not on reddit as often as I'd like but I'll always get back to you. 




 I have started doing this recently. We just have to keep in mind that there is a difference between getting *drunk* and having a couple of beers after a hard day to help you keep pushing through. Set limits. 




 You are right, this is not ok at all. If they are being this unhelpful now they are probably not going to be reliable in the future- as a general rule I wouldn't keep a psychiatrist who didn't give me a means to contact them and receive a reply within twenty four hours, communication counts for a lot. 

If you only care about getting meds after one or two appointments this person may give you a repeat prescription (in which case it would not be particularly important to have regular meetings with them anyway) but a good psychiatrist should be more than just a guy who gives you access to drugs so I would keep reviewing your options and find out if there is any way you could see someone more accessible.

In any case, contact the office again and stress that it is extremely urgent and you need to be seen as soon as possible. No one should have to wait for months and months to be seen.
