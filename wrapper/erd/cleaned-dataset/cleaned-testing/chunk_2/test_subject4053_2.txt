 Completely unrelated, but he reminded me of what my grandpa used to say. He was born and raised out West. 

"On windy nights, listen to the wind, if you hear the door rattle more than twice in a row, don't get up, don't speak and whatever you do, don't check outside, because thems the dead, tryin' to trick you and once you let them in, they never leave, and not all of em is nice" 




 Yeah, this isn't as gruesome as the title says. 

I was talking to my sister earlier and we were remembering some of the stuff from when my grandma was alive. 

My grandma was born in 1936(she died two years ago) 

There was a story I remember her telling my sister and I once that goes something like this. 

When my grandma was a little girl, about 7 or so years old. Her dad found a scrawny little black dog. My grandmas dad according to her, was a big, tough guy that had a soft-spot for dogs, so he brought it home. 

My grandma said that this little dog was really weird, it just walked around looking at everything or sat there staring into space, didn't bark, didn't play, and it barely ate, so it always stayed skinny. She also said it stunk constantly, no matter how many times they bathed it. 

About a year after they found the dog, it got kicked by one of their horses (mind you she said this was a little terrier sized dog) Well, the dog simply got up, shrugged it off and walked away, when they checked the dog over, it had no broken bones at all. 

A couple of years later, her mom accidentally ran the dog over with her car and the dog "died" so her dad took the dog out into the woods and buried it in a shallow grave and put a couple heavy branches over the grave so nothing could dig the dog up. 

Two days later, they came home from church to find the dog sitting on their porch, covered in dirt but otherwise perfectly fine but after that, continued to stink like rotten meat, she said. 

It got so bad that they had to keep the dog tied up outside. 

The dog got attacked by a coyote and had it's eye punctured and one of it's ears ripped off. It acted like it didn't even phase it. 

My grandma said that this little dog lived well into her young adult years (from the time she was about 7 to the time she was 20 or 21

During that time,  she said the dog had been shot twice, ran over again, kicked by two more horses and quilled by a porcupine. 

It survived each event as if nothing happened. 

She said the dog ran off when she moved out of her parents house and she never saw it again. 

Edited for a couple spelling oopsies*** 




 I'm actually not entirely sure about that. I know Slenderymans started out as a croopypooster. But I can, to this day, remember having a dream when I was younger, It was one of those realistic dreams, of walking past the steps which led downstairs of my old house, at the bottom of the stairs, there was a bathroom to the right. In the dream, I remember looking down and seeing a tall, white skinned figure with no face staring up at me. It scared me so much that I woke up bawling. 

A friend of mine told me several years later, that he had had the exact same dream while staying over at the house one weekend. I had never told him about my dream.

and this was many, many years before Slenderman even became a thing.
