 Don't fret.

It'll all work out in the end.

Check your watch... it's almost time. 




 Sleep?

Don't go to sleep.

Come back to the pantry.

What's in the box?

It always feels weird to go home. Surreal, like somehow walking into someone else's life; it's not mine anymore. The scenery changes very little over the years in small towns, but the things that happen there no longer concern me. My stresses and routines exist somewhere else while these ones have gone cold like the still air in the empty bedroom in my parent's house.

Mom was happy to see me. It had been over a year since I'd visited her, and she'd aged years in that time. Her hair was shorter, and flatter, and she had new glasses whose thick, brown frames made her face seem even thinner.

I couldn't tell her everything. It was just too weird, and my thoughts were too disorganized. I told her that Mark was missing, and I was expecting the police or someone to come looking for me in the morning. I talked for a little while about the rest of my time in Thailand, and then shut myself in my room. I fell onto my old bed, and was asleep.

I'm having weird dreams every night now. In them, I'll go places and talk to people like I would if I were awake. There are usually just bits and pieces - tall shelves, faceless men in suits and a few times now I've dreamed of the red tree. They feel like dreams the next day... but sometimes while they're going on, I'm afraid that I might wake up, standing in the middle of that shop in Thailand, Alan smiling at me with broken teeth, and empty eyes like Mark's mask.

I woke up at midnight. After tossing and turning, I gave up the fight to keep my eyes closed. I checked reddit on my phone while laying draped over the edge of my old bed. Damn, some of you seem to have it even worse than I do. Others of your stories are eerily similar. Out of curiosity, I decided to search for the post I'd found before, "All In Good Time."

Everything was almost exactly the same except for two things: the score was much higher and it had more comments than it had the first time. The second thing that had changed was the address. Instead of Pattaya, Thailand, it now had the name of my home town in Oregon. Google Maps pointed to a place about a mile and a half from my house.

I was tempted to go there. *Drawn.* Something pulled at the strings inside my head, puppeting my hands as I got dressed and laced my shoes. Just before I reached the front door, I stopped and stood for a full minute in my mom's living room. Just to see if I could.

This wasn't a dream. I wasn't sleepwalking. I wasn't possessed. I just... needed to know.

Out the front door, I pulled my hoodie tighter around my shoulders against the cold and stuffed my hands deeper into my pockets. It was colder here than Thailand had been, especially in the middle of the night. In high school I used to walk like this all the time, just setting out without a place to go. I planned on going near the store, but not inside. I wanted to see it, but for now... I was just walking.

As I reached the more populated areas, I passed more people out on the street. I skirted the lights and hoped that no one would try to talk to me and kept up a pretty fast pace.

I reached the place on the map where it had said the store would be. It was in the middle of a strip of little shops - book stores, antiques, boutique clothes. At first glance, I wasn't sure it was the place. It was conspicuously empty and barren. A white sign with red lettering read "For Sale" on the largest window. On my toes, I was just able to see through the windows to the shadowy empty shelves inside.

"There you are," said a voice behind me. I spun and saw a man leaning out the window of an impeccable white convertible Mustang. The car hadn't made a sound before, but now the engine was chugging in a low growl. It was the shop owner from Thailand still wearing the same suit that I'd seen him in before. His crooked teeth were on display through a thin-lipped smile. He looked slightly deranged. "I was hoping I'd find you here. It seems to me like you've got something I want. Two somethings, actually." He licked his lips as he looked me up and down.

"Fuck off!" I screamed as I kicked his car with a muddy sneaker.

Faster than I could react, he was out of the car and coming toward me. With surprising strength, he shoved me against the window behind me.

"Listen, you little bitch. You made a deal," He growled like an animal. Every word was punctuated with pain. He seemed to be all elbows beneath his jacket. Insanely, my biggest fear in that moment was that he would bite or claw me. He was panting, and his hot breath smelled strongly of stale tobacco.

Then his smile returned. He released me from the wall and took a step back, straightening his tie and jacket.

"Tomorrow night, before the sun rises, I expect to have the watch delivered to me. I'll warn you though, I don't give extensions easily, miss."

So that was it. He was after the pocket watch.

He ducked back into the ghostly white Mustang and slowly rolled down the street and out of sight.

My heart was nearly beating a hole through my chest. I pulled myself up from where I'd collapsed on the sidewalk and ran until I saw perhaps the only place still open in town that late at night. With no one in sight, I leaned against the wall and caught my breath before turning the corner and entering Rustic Sports Bar.

"Hi, we close in an hour!" shouted the woman from the behind the bar.

I told her that was fine and ordered a drink, downed it and ordered another. The noise and movement of the games replaying on the televisions was calming, though I wished that more people were there. I was afraid to go back outside.

After another drink and a few more commercial breaks, someone came up behind me.

"Hey I know you, don't I?" said a male voice.

It was some guy who I recognized him from high school. His name was Ben. He was a couple years older than me and we'd hever hung out, but was really well-known for being the school's star basketball player. I'd heard a lot of rumors of teachers being forced to give him extra credit and turning D's to B's to keep him on the team. There was pressure to keep him playing, but there was more pressure from his wealthy and well-connected father.

I guess the rumors had been true, since after he'd gone to play at a Division 1 school on a scholarship, he'd failed out after the first semester because of his grades. He looked like he spent more time in the bar than on the basketball court these days.

He was obnoxious and drunk, but talking to someone eased my nerves. When the bar closed, I convinced him to give me a ride back home. I dodged his clumsy attempt to kiss me and tried to ignore his creeping hands. It took him a while for him to understand that he wasn't invited inside. The tires of his too-expensive car squealed as he took off down the street.

---

I was seven when my mom finally left my dad. The fight before the split dragged on all night. I guess that they'd each just had enough, and threw everything they had at each other. A few months later, he passed away and at his funeral, my uncle had said that it was because of a broken heart. Even at seven I'd known that he'd never had one to begin with.

Anyway, I remember packing my toys on the day that we left. I was a serious tomboy at that age, and didn't own even a single pink thing. All my toys were the cool boy toys of the 90's. I carefully appraised each one before putting it into the blue Jansport backpack I used for school. They wouldn't all fit, and I had to take apart my Legos to pack them down better. I worried that she'd make me leave them when I came out of my room, backpack full and carrying Stretch Armstrong and Buzz Lightyear in my arms. She didn't say anything though. She just packed some pictures and our clothes into a couple suitcases and then we got into her car and went to grandma's.

I stayed with grandma for a long time before mom came back. I don't think that she had a place to stay, so she left me there where I'd be safe. I hadn't really minded, since grandma's house was amazing. I missed the last month or so of school, and then it was summer. 

I played outside every minute of the day, and whenever I came inside with grass stains on my knees and scrapes on my elbows, grandma would tell me how that was "just the way it should be," then she'd make me open-faced peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that were somehow sweeter and more delicious than the kind anyone else made.

The forest behind her house seemed huge. There were a few miles of hiking trails that no one owned or ever used that fed down from the main road along the top of the hill to the big lake at the bottom. Gradually, like entropy, the toys I'd brought in my backpack got spread out to all my favorite spots in the woods. Stretch Armstrong died in a tree-climbing accident when his rubbery legs got caught on a broken branch. He bled sticky corn syrup all over the pine needles and my hands and he slowly deflated.

I knew that there was no way to bring him back, so instead I reasoned that a fitting memorial would be to tie him at the very highest point of the tree, where his plastic smiling face could look out over the woods and the lake forever. He'd be the one in the crow's nest whenever I played pirates on the ground.

The tree wobbled as I climbed it. I was a skinny kid, but the tree was thinner, and it bent precariously. I quickly tied his arms and legs in double granny knots and raised him into his final resting place, then I looked out where his blank eyes were looking.

Straight ahead, not far away, reflections of clouds were swimming in the still blue lake. Going west would take me back to grandma's house, and to the east was more forest, and fewer houses until you went all the way out to the Boy Scout camp. From our perch, Armstrong and I could see their dock poking out from the shore. Just past that, something red caught my eye.

I double checked Stretch - he looked happy in his final resting place - then climbed down, found my best stick-sword and headed off toward the lake. My imagination was always in overdrive then, but now there was something real to investigate. I thought about what I'd do if it were a hot air balloon whose pilot needed my help to get back into the air. I shuddered to think what if it were a UFO?

I hugged the shoreline, moving quick to keep my feet from sinking in the soft sand. I passed a forked tree, the base of which held three of my power rangers, waiting for Zordon's call for their next adventure. 

You had to be careful going into the Boy Scout's territory, and normally I never played in there. Girls weren't allowed. If an adult found you, they could have you "thrown out" according to my grandma. I knew that she meant that someone's dad would call and have you picked up, but I'd always imagined a band of scouts tying me up with chains and padlocks and tossing me off the end of the dock.

Thankfully no one was there this time. I didn't need to, but snuck through the campground like Mission Impossible anyway, eyes wide and ears open for any sound. Everything was completely silent. Strangely so.

I'd imagined a hundred things that the red spot I'd seen from the crow's nest could be. The logical side of my brain had even considered a piece of garbage, or the Boy Scouts' misplaced canoe. The only thing I hadn't allowed myself to consider was that it was just another tree.

Most of the trees in the forest were the kind with needles. In fact, the only trees I saw with leaves were the apple trees my grandma had planted in front of her house. As I came up on the curious red tree with five-pointed maple leaves, I wondered if maybe this tree had been planted too. Nothing else was growing for 30 or 40 feet in every direction around it. Each one of its leaves glowed bright, deep red like cranberry juice.

I snuck forward, casting one last look back to the empty camp, and the direction of grandma's house. It was starting to get that cool feeling that you get at the end of the day. I'd have to start back soon, or race the sun for its remaining light. 

I stepped into the circle of dead around the tree, and a weird, irritating sensation washed over me. The evening air was no longer cold. Actually, it felt like heat was emanating straight up out of the ground. There was a smell with it too, like must and decomposition. I had the strong feeling that I was some place I shouldn't have been, like I had entered some kind of memorial or grave that I shouldn't have been treading on.

So I left. After sneaking through the camp and the woods, I got back to grandma's just as it was getting dark, sat at the table until I cleaned my plate, and forgot the whole thing.

Days came and went without a care or a thing to do. I started to feel like my time at grandma's would just go on forever. That was the life. I hoped that nothing would ever change.

But change came knocking on the front door as I was getting ready for bed. I was brushing my teeth in the downstairs bathroom, pajamas already on and eyelids heavy.

The knocking came, but it sounded more like someone was kicking the door. I heard my father's voice. Even through the thick, wooden frame, it echoed through the house. He was calling my name, and calling grandma something else.

Grandma rushed downstairs to get me, and whisked me up into the attic through a set of trapdoor stairs. She took something that looked like a briefcase with a lock on it, except it was almost as long as she was tall, then she kissed the top of my head and went back down the stairs, closing the trapdoor behind her.

I crawled over the insulation, and looked out through the window with one eye. I could see my father's truck, but one side of the hood had been dented in. The bed looked like it was full of cans and bottles. I could still hear him screaming, but it didn't sound like he was at the front door anymore. 

I heard a crash downstairs, like a window breaking and then a bang that shook the walls and made me cover my ears. My father and my grandma were screaming worse than when mom and he had fought, then grandma went quiet.

There was a latch on the attic window, which pushed open and let me out onto the roof. From there I dropped down onto the garage like dropping out of a tree. I tried to climb down the rain gutter from the garage to the ground, but it wasn't fastened. With a screech and moan of twisting hollow metal, I dropped onto the damp ground and ran barefoot into the woods. A minute later, I could hear my father calling my name.

I didn't care. My fear gave me wings carried me away.

I had hiding spots. These were *my* woods, after all. If I'd wanted to, I could have hidden all night. To this day, I still don't know why I didn't do exactly that, but before I'd started running, even before I'd unlatched the window and gone outside, I'd known that I was going back to the red tree.

My father bounded loudly through the brush like a mindless hulk behind me. I moved quietly along the edge of the lake, like I'd done a thousand times before.

There were lights on at the Boy Scout camp. I could have run there for help, waking them in their cabins, but something about the tree was calling me just a little further ahead. My father had stopped yelling, and had cleared the trees and underbrush. I didn't know where he was.

I saw the tree for a second - bared of all its leaves, its trunk now bleached white, before the ground dropped out from beneath my feet. The whole dead circle around the tree had sunken several feet, and was now filled with rainwater. Shed bark and leaves covered the surface like tissue paper and shattered black ice. The water was warm, almost hot. I broke the surface and swam the best I could toward its bone white trunk, like a marble statue of a graceful hand reaching out of the muck.

"Allie!" my father called from behind me, teetering on the edge of the circle, holding a rifle. "I'm not gonna tell you again, Allie, get out of there, right now."

My fingers closed around the trunk of the tree. It was so slick. I'd climbed trees every day for the past two months, and even had a growth spurt, but there was no way to climb that tree.

My stomach fell. Despite all my imagination, I hadn't thought of what to do now that I'd made it there. I had failed. I gripped the branches and shook them in frustration. What had I thought was going to happen?

"You're going to make me do this, girl. You and and that damned mother of yours."

He had the rifle up at his shoulder, eye in the sights and finger on the trigger. I ducked sideways, sinking back under the water. Instead of a gunshot, there was silence like I'd gone deaf. Lights played across my closed eyelids. I felt the water swirling around me, throwing me limply around, and stretching me like thin rubber filled with corn syrup.

Then... it was over. I was sitting at the top of the white maple, my legs dangling below. The place that my father had been standing just a moment ago was illuminated by the headlights of a police cruiser. They were so afraid at first that I'd been shot. The water, dyed red by the fallen leaves had soaked me like blood.

In my hand, I found a tiny pocketwatch. The inside isn't a mermaid in the water... it's me.

Eventually - unbelieveably - I forgot... I forgot about the tree. I forgot how my father had disappeared. I forgot everything until it found me again in Thailand.

I don't know why it chose that place or that time, or why it waited so long to find me, but now it has. It found me in Thailand, but I think somehow that it's never been far away... and it will be waiting for me when I get back home.

It's waited all this time, and now it's coming for me.
 




 Hopefully I'll be able to explain more tomorrow.

This isn't even close to being finished.

#[Calling](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2klvr6/it_found_me_in_thailand_part_3/)

It found me in Thailand.

I came here with my best friend Mark for a 30-day volunteer trip. We're both graduating from college next year and we've been told that "extracurriculars" like this look good on a resume. The company that Mark's father works for paid for the whole thing. More important than the practical reasons, neither of us had ever been that far outside of the U.S., and you're not going to pass up a free trip to Thailand.

The work was easy. All we had to do was basically show up and lend an extra set of hands when and where it was needed. Our busy days combined with a healthy dash of culture shock made the time fly by. Before we knew it, we were being bused to Pattaya and preparing to fly home.

Pattaya isn't as wild as Bangkok, but it's got a firm grip on the second-place title. Every night of the year is a party. Downtown, there are bars and massage parlors on every corner. The hotel they put us at was right in the middle of it all.

We were supposed to stay one night there and then leave for Hawaii the following morning, but a potential hurricane in Hawaii and monsoons threatening Thailand canceled any flights that way until further notice. Mark called the volunteer organization to let them know, and everything was taken care of. They were amazingly understanding of the whole thing, and they even agreed to wire us some extra per diem to offset the cost of living in downtown.

Mark and I were 21 years old, sex and alcohol deprived for the last 30 days, and fate just plopped into our laps at least two days in Thailand, all expenses paid. We were living in a dream.

The first evening, we walked all over downtown. We knew we'd end up hitting the bars that night, but at about 5:00 pm, I thought it was a little early to get tanked. They've got about a million shops that sell cheap, knock-off goods, and the street food is fresh-cooked and out of this world, so despite Mark's bitching, we paced ourselves.

It was the last place we were going to go before we quit shopping and started partying. 

Most of the booths and open-air vendors specialize in selling one type of thing. One guy will sell T-shirts. The next store will have fake brand-name headphones and electronics. The next will sell toys, luggage, purses, shoes... The point is, this store was different. It had *everything* - completely eclectic.

I'm in love. Every single piece has so much personality. They're the kinds of things that represent a story, someone's childhood, a life. Someone's stack of handwritten journals, antiques, a weathered leather briefcase with papers sticking out of the edges, a taped BB gun, a bike, a wedding dress...

We're the only people there besides the vendor, whose name tag reads "ALAN," who's standing behind a small counter, almost like a podium, and eying us while fiddling with something in his hands.

Mark doesn't care about the churchlike quiet because he's trying to get me to hurry up and go, so when the vendor greets us and says something about a "good time" Mark practically shouts, "Yeah! We're looking for a good time!"

The vendor smiles, and then brings something up to his mouth. With his other hand, he throws some pistachio shells into a little bin by his feet.

He wipes his hands on the pants of his black suit, and waves to Mark to follow him to the other side of the store. "Everything is for trade here. I collect all sorts of things, as you can see. I believe that I have just what you're looking for." The place is small, and in only a few steps, he's reached the wall that's furthest from the rust-colored windows. The vendor bends down, reaches into a wooden cupboard and pulls out a silver tea set. A steaming pot, cups, the whole shebang.

He smiles wide, showing rows of broken, tar-stained teeth, and holds up the tea saying, "Drink this, and I can guarantee that you'll have an unforgettable night."

The scent of the tea was amazing. Beyond amazing, it was unlike anything I'd ever experienced. It seemed to fill the entire shop in an instant. The smell of dust and age was gone, and I found myself daydreaming about my grandmother's house as a kid. 

In the summers, my dad would be out of work a lot. Whenever he was home, my mom and him would get into fights. When things got really shitty, they'd send me to stay the weekends with my mom's mom. Somehow it smelled just like the sunshine that shone through the woods behind her house that were all mine whenever I went there. It smelled like freedom and fun, adventure and good times.

After that, everything is blank. I don't even remember sitting down or drinking the tea. The very next thing that I remember is Mark saying "I gotta take a shit after this, my stomach is killing."

We were sitting in leather reclining chairs, having our feet massaged. I felt the familiar buzz of alcohol, but otherwise felt awake and normal.

I looked over at Mark, and noticed that he was wearing different clothes; black pants and a matching button-up shirt had replaced his colorful board shorts and tee, and for some reason he was carrying white mask like a mannequin's face.

Outside, the sun was gone and the rain was hammering down in sheets onto the muddy streets. When I got up to pay and leave, I found a big wad of Thai baht in my pocket equal to just over $1100 USD and a note in my own handwriting.

    Don't let him have it.

I rushed outside into the rain. Mark cut his massage short and followed after me, collecting his shoes from the flimsy wooden rack outside.

"What the fuck is going on with you, Allie?"

"I can't remember anything."

"Yeah, you're probably fucked up from all the drinks you've had, I told you to slow down at that last place-"

"No. I don't even remember drinking. Mark, I'm serious, the last thing I remember is going into that little shop, and the guy serving us tea."

Mark smiled and stared at me for a second. "This is weird, Allie, I don't get it. Not a very good joke."

"You remember?"

"Remember? Yeah, of course, I remember the weird tea guy yesterday, what about it?"

*Yesterday? What the hell had happened all night?*

It was too much, I could hardly breathe. I sat hard on the crumbling curb, while cars and mopeds darted just inches from my feet.

"Uh... Hey, if you're like, sick or something, maybe we should go, but we can't just sit right here like this, they're going to find us." He pulled me up by the shoulder.

"Who's going to find us?"

"Those guys with the fliers that we were fucking with. You know, I was wearing the mask, and walking back and forth taking their fliers, until they started chasing us off... Holy shit, you really don't remember, do you?"

"I can't remember shit. I need..." *A doctor? A priest? A psychiatrist?* "I don't know. How do we get back to the hotel from here?"

---

We each had separate rooms in the hotel, both on the seventh floor. From the elevator, Mark's room was the first door on the right, while mine was near the end of the balcony to the left. On the way over, Mark had complained about his stomach hurting again and had eventually gone quiet, holding one arm across his gut. Maybe it was just some kind of sympathy pain, but my stomach felt like it was starting to cramp as well. When we got out of the elevator he rushed over to his room.

"I'll call you in a little while," I said, unsure if he heard me or not before he disappeared into his door.

I went toward my room, and followed the convex curve of the building. When I rounded the final turn, I saw Mark in his black clothes, with his blank white mask on standing outside my room, then push his way inside and out of sight.

I froze. The balcony didn't go in a circle. There was no way that he could have gotten around me.

I walked backwards, eye on my door until I was out of sight, then ran back to Mark's room and pounded my fists on his door. He didn't answer, even when I yelled his name and pleaded.

I stood knocking for several minutes, trying to watch both sides of the balcony for signs of him or someone in a white mask. Then my stomach cramped. The sharp pain doubled me over. Once the pain cleared, I wiped the tears from my eyes and went back into the elevator.

Some Indian tourists were already standing on the tiny box before I got on, and said something in a language I didn't understand. I'm sure I looked crazy. Another wave of pain came on the way down. I tried to ignore it, and focused instead on the watercolor painting of a red maple tree that hung on the back of the elevator. Someone had burned a cigarette-sized hole through the canvas at some point before it had been set in its frame. I tried to burn another hole through it with my eyes, and bit my cheek to keep from screaming.

The pain subsided slightly when I got to the bottom floor. The Indian family rushed away from me, and I dizzily stumbled out of the lobby and into the street.

I nearly got run over by a pickup and then a taxi cab as I crossed the street to a 7-Eleven. People were shouting at me from the sidewalk, but I couldn't make out their faces through the pouring rain.

Another wave of pain washed over me as I was met by the blinding white lights inside the shop. I fell to my knees and everything in my stomach lurched up onto the ground. It felt like I was vomiting shards of glass set on fire. With every heave, I felt like my throat was tearing.

it went on and on, leaving me laying on the ground, gasping for breath.

Pistachio shells, a mound of them, lay on the ground in the center of a bloody puddle. On the top of the pile was a tiny ornate pocket watch with a delicate silver chain.

---

Paramedics scooped me up off the floor of the 7-eleven. The Thai hospital was surprisingly modern, the staff seemed to be well-trained and polite. Despite most of the rest of the city appearing to exist sometime in the past decade, the ER was comfortingly modern. I was put in a bay, curtain dividers between beds. Primarily male nurses hustled about, checking fluids and medicines. Apparently, there isn't much you can do for esophageal bleeding besides ensuring that the person remains calm and doesn't try to eat anything.

I found my phone on the table along with my keys, my rifled-through wallet and the pocket watch. I was surprised again to find that there was free WiFi inside the hospital. I searched for the strange shop with the tea on Google, but it was like Google Maps didn't exist yet in this country, and practically no businesses were listed. Review sites and listings were worthless without already knowing the name of the place.

        15% battery remaining.

I tried sending another text to Mark. Then, thinking I'd earned a short break, I opened up Reddit...

And there it was.

"All In Good Time," was right at the top of my front page. It was here - in nosleep. Strictly speaking, I didn't even think that the story belonged. It was more of a review of the shop that sold anything and everything you could want, located at 1111  street, just a few blocks from the hotel that we'd stayed at. According to OP, you could find any and everything you wanted, "as well as a few things that they hadn't known that they needed before they walked through the door."

As I said, the post wasn't the kind of thing that belonged on nosleep, except for maybe the strange description of the owner named Alan. The man that we'd seen at All In Good Time had been an elderly Thai man, but the man in the post was described as white with a southern accent and a habit of chain-smoking. 

What was even stranger about the post was that shouldn't have been at the top of my front page. It only had a few dozen points and I didn't know how it could possibly have been right, but its time stamp was a month old.

Thinking I'd missed something, I scrolled down to the comments section. A few rulebreakers were calling out OP for posting something "unrealistic," while most others said that the shop was in their home town, and that they couldn't wait to check it out later that week. Apparently Pattaya is full of Redditors...

One comment in particular stood out to me, though. The time stamp said 1 minute ago when I found it. I copied and pasted it below:

MarkyShark  3 minutes ago  1 point

its all i know  
the dark the cold  
these four walls  
when night falls  
youll see it too 

It was Mark's account. He was alive! I quietly cursed him for not answering my texts. I tapped on his name to see if he'd posted anything else recently but there was nothing older than that day. On the second picture, my phone died.

I set it back on the table and picked up the pocketwatch. I'd gotten it after my father had died. It was no bigger than a quarter, with a little knob and a ring for the chain. Pulling the knob out would allow you to wind it, and pushing it in would open the polished silver clamshell. Inside were tiny moving pieces showing a mermaid swimming in wavy water. She'd drop below the surface as the waves would rise up, and break the surface again and again. I've never seen anything else like it in my life.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHssd14YyYo spfreload=10) is the closest thing I could find, but imagine it being absolutely tiny, tucked into a coin-sized watch.

It was frustrating and confusing not to remember the night before. I must have swallowed it along with everything else - but why?

A doctor opened the curtain, breaking into my thoughts, and set a cardboard box on the floor beside my bed.

He spoke in incomprehensibly fast Thai, while making hand signals that I should hold out my arm and roll up my sleeve. From the box, he pulled one of those blood pressure sleeves. He took my vitals, which resulted in a frown. Then had me say "Ah" and looked down my throat with a flashlight. More frowns. He made the motion of bringing a cup to his lips and drinking, and made what I thought was a questioning face. I nodded yes, apparently not fully understanding. He made the motion again. I said yes again, and he grew more impatient.

From his box, he pulled a glass jar with a rubber cork that had a small fitting on the top. He set them on the rolling tray beside my bed, then he pulled out a piece of elastic surgical tubing and a clear plastic tube, which he fitted onto the cork. Then, from his pocket he took out a needle. He wrapped the surgical tubing around my arm, had me flex my hand a few times to find the vein and started to draw blood into the container.

This was weird. Thinking that maybe I had accidentally agreed to something I shouldn't have, I just waited awkwardly. Small talk isn't my strong suit anyway, let alone with someone who doesn't speak the same language. To avoid making eye contact, I scanned the patterns on the curtains while the container filled up. Behind me on the wall, where I hadn't looked before, was a painting. A watercolor that someone had burned a cigarette-sized hole into before they'd framed it.

The scene in this painting was slightly different than the one in the elevator. Instead of a red maple, this one was a red circular pool with two lines sticking out of it like hands on a clock. One line was just a negative white space that pointed straight up. The other was black, like a shadow cast by the white hand, that stretched horizontally over the edge of the red pool. At the very end of that black, tapering line, was the cigarette burn. The painting *felt* different too. The last one, I had felt was irritating for some reason. If that one was a little kid with a squirt gun, this one was like a cool, still pond.

I'm sorry if that doesn't make sense. I just don't know a better way to describe how a picture makes you hear silence, and can take you to another place like that.

I must have stared for a while - for too long, because when I looked back, the doctor was gone, along with the jar. The needle was still in my arm, pouring blood through the tube into the empty box, staining the edges red. I pulled the needle out of my arm, scrambled to throw the blankets and sheets off myself, grabbed my things from the table, and shot through the curtain into the bay. I was scared, but more than that, I was fucking mad.

A quick look back showed the box had fallen on its side. Its lid now appeared be sealed shut with bleeding tape. Nurses and cleaning staff were staring at me, calling out to me in Thai, but in a few seconds I was back outside in the rain.

I found my way back to the hotel. The elevator walls now only held mirrors that showed bags under my eyes, the same ratty t-shirt from the previous day, and hair stuck out in every direction. Between the mirrors, there were advertisements for restaurants and Ripley's Believe it or Not! I didn't believe it, but I also didn't give a shit anymore. At the seventh floor, I almost went right to knock on Mark's door, but decided against it. I had to worry about myself first. Once I was safely headed away from this hellhole, I could worry about Mark.

I opened the door to my room, and fumbled with the light switch without stepping inside. The room was clear. I checked the closet, under the beds, the balcony, and locked the conjoining door and the deadbolt to the outside. I put some heavy wooden chairs in front of the entrances and turned on the TV for background noise.

If they were ever going to believe me, I had to at least look sane. I showered with both eyes open, scanning through the glass window-walls to the rest of the room. I kept imagining a disembodied white mask floating in the air, watching me with blank eyes.

Nothing happened. I got dressed, grabbed my things and left. I never went within ten feet of the cardboard box sitting in the far corner of the room. I took a picture, but it didn't turn out - just black.

The cab driver had some trouble understanding that I wanted to go to the American Embassy. There had to be one, I didn't care if it was in Bangkok. Luckily, there was one in the city.

It seemed like they questioned me for hours... They couldn't find the name of the volunteer organization that had sent us, and the only deposits on our cards had come directly from Mark's dad's credit card. They tried to find a hole in my story, but I just came clean. I gave them everything I knew, which wasn't much. I wrote down a timeline from the time we'd gotten there to now and whenever they'd ask a question, I'd just point to it.

I insisted that I couldn't stay in Thailand; that someone was after me and my friend. It wasn't until they went to Mark's room that they finally believed me at all. An officer of some sort pulled the suited man who was in charge aside and showed him something on his phone. The man put his hand over his mouth and looked away.

When they came back, I was assigned an escort, and was taken via military jet to Hawaii. Before I left, the man in a plain gray suit covered with official-looking laminated badges said that they'd take care of everything there.

I thought that it was over, then. When we were safely up in the air, I pulled a borrowed blanket over my face, and quietly cried. It wasn't long before the droning of the engines and gentle rocking of the air currents put me to sleep.
 




 Wow I want to believe that that was actually written by OP's grandfather. Such a cool story, especially if that's the case. 




 Finally got around to reading part 1. It's a long one, but the way it's told is unlike anything else I've read here. Good find. 




 Hey thanks for sharing this story. That's a really neat idea to make up an urban legend and tell it different ways.

I wonder if the post might have been more popular if you'd excluded the other links at the beginning of the post. I initially thought that I was missing something and that I'd have to go back to part one and read the whole series, but that didn't seem to be the case.

Thanks again for sharing! 




 This is why you're the man. 




 I awoke to the sound of glass breaking. Then I felt the impact of the car and the seatbelt digging into my stomach and shoulder.

I'd been driving two hours to my new job for three months. A job isn't even "new" at that point, I guess, it's just a job. The last week, I'd stepped up the amount of hours and I couldn't even remember seeing the sun. I went to work before dawn and got back after midnight every single day.

It was too much, I guess, and I fell asleep. I blamed myself every day for it. I thought about all the things I might have been able to do to prevent it. I just... couldn't take it back.

I went to her funeral. It felt wrong not to for some reason. Almost no one was there. Two middle-aged people I'd assumed to be her parents, an elderly man and the priest. Everything was extremely formal, dry and felt pre-packaged. The words that were said felt fake. It was a Hallmark funeral.

Afterwards, I went to talk to the girl's parents. I had to apologize in person, despite the advice of my lawyers.

"Excuse me? Sorry... I..." My tongue twisted. Maybe I should have written something down.

But then, bizarrely, they both smiled and shook my hand. "Hello. We know who you are. Thank you. Thank you so much."

I was shocked. Even more, I was offended. What about the girl we'd just buried? Didn't she deserve... some emotion? Some hate for her killer?

"Krista was a troubled child. I don't know how you could understand without having met her."

"Yes, deeply troubled."

"You see, we used to have four children."

"And now... well, now we have none."

"It was Krista."

"We can't prove that - "

"But we know it was her. They all died in their sleep."

"She posed their bodies."

"They looked so peaceful."

Tears were welling in both of their eyes. I felt sick.

"She finally looked peaceful, sir. So thank you."

"Thank you so much."

I was glad that I went to the funeral. Finally. I had no regret; I knew that despite everything that had happened, this was the fate she deserved. 




 This is nice. The whole thing just has that feeling of being well-said.

 New Orleans, a new drunk on the market and flags 

I moved to New Orleans when I was in my early 20's and before Katrina hit, the place was awesome with a capital A. I loved the culture, the parties, the parades, Mardis Gras... Everything.

When the hurricane hit and the city went under, I was stupid. I didn't listen and didn't believe that something that bad could happen. A lot of people didn't. I didn't get out in time.

Everyone knows that things changed after the storm and the floods, but... I think what I saw was something different. Bear with me, I've never told anyone about this before.

The hurricane affected my neighborhood pretty much like every other neighborhood in New Orleans. The days following were something else, though. I came back to my house to find that almost nothing was left. The basic structure was (fortunately) still standing, but water had risen up to the gutters. The insides were trashed.

That night, some men came by wearing suits. We thought that they were from the government - they were very official-looking. But instead of... inspections, aid, assistance, whatever, they were selling drugs! I couldn't believe it - here we were without fresh water, food, clothes, shelter... and these assholes were selling drugs!

I'm not the confrontational type, but I stared them down until they were off my block.

The next day I started noticing flags being set up outside my neighbors' houses - almost all of them. An identical black flag hung in front of their front door. I knocked on the house next door to see if they were home. Maybe I'd slept through some kind of aid effort? Maybe the flags signified that the house was occupied or... I don't know. I just didn't want to be left out.

My neighbor Charles answered the door. I'd never seen him look so terrible. I mean, terrible had been re-defined by surviving a natural disaster, that was a given, but his lips were blue, and I swear his eyes were faded, turning white.

He opened the door and I asked him about the flag. He just wandered inside his house, sat on the couch and didn't say a word. His wife and daughter were there on the couch too. They were all staring at a black TV screen (we didn't have any power).

The neighbors across the street were exactly the same. I started suspecting that everyone with a black flag in front of their steps had turned into some kind of mindless drone.

It lasted for two full days. On the third morning everyone was back to normal.

I think... somehow, it saved their lives. I was struggling during that time just to live. Just to not be poisoned and to get by, but everyone else... it's like they had a free pass for two days. 









 /r/nosleep, we like you, but you're more fun when you're drunk. 




 This is the only serious answer here. 




 Not at all what I had expected from the title.

I pictured a kid knocking on a fish tank, or Dudley knocking on the snake's glass at the zoo. "Come on! Come out! We just want to play with you." 




 The title and premise is so zany, but man, this story just works! 




 I could picture this place so well. Terrifying. 




 Oh my god. Awesome. 




 Officers were waiting in front of my house in unmarked cars. I didn't even have time to get my bag out of my car before they had me in cuffs and carried me roughly into the back of a black SUV. At the station they asked me about a childhood friend, Rick. I hadn't seen him in twenty years - we used to frequent the same playset in school before he moved away. They shoved pictures under my nose of a crashed car, a bloody street, drag marks in the dirt leading from the highway and into the woods. I had nothing to do with it, I swear.

Hours passed, and they finally let me go. When I got home, it was after midnight. A cold breeze was blowing in through a broken window. Rick was standing in the shadows of my kitchen, a slit of light cast across his stubbled face.

"You said we'd always be best friends, Trev. I need a friend. I think I did something bad." 




 Thanks, brah!

 Before my senior year of high school, I volunteered to be a camp counselor for the summer. The experience was life-changing for me in more ways than one. It was what made me decide to become a teacher. It gave me self-confidence and an excitement for leadership that I'd never had before.

As a counselor, you typically ran an activity station for a few hours at a time. The kids were old enough to decide for themselves what they wanted to do during free time. The coordinated events were put on by the full-time employees, as well as the running of the facilities and the dorms. (Most parents wouldn't have let their kids stay a week with a bunch of irresponsible high schoolers.)

I was typically in charge of the giant tree swing and the arts and crafts stations. I'd trade back and forth every day with another counselor named Leslie.

Kids were in camp for 5 days. On day three I ran out of ideas for what to do in the arts and crafts station. They had all kinds of supplies - rope, string and beads for making necklaces and bracelets, paints and easels, a whole bundle of knitting needles and string... the only problem was that I didn't know how to do any of those things very well.

Then in one of the cupboards I found some quilting supplies. Weirdly, I knew how to do that from trips to my grandmother's house as a kid. The rest of the day, I organized the camp quilting club. It really caught on. Our quilt looked terrible - stuffing poked out and threads ran along the ground - but the kids loved it.

On the third day, I noticed that we were running low on patches. I went back into the cupboard, and stuffed into the back, I found a whole quilt. I had no choice but to cannibalize it for the cause. I started cutting off the patches. I had a small pile started, when I started to notice that the filling of this quilt wasn't cotton. It was stringy and stretchy. It might have been some kind of sawdust.

Old Mrs. Collins, one of the permanent employees working there, bustled into the shed, and shrieked with fear when she saw what I was doing. She barreled over and ripped the quilt from my hands and took the patches with her as well, then ran out the door. I sat stunned inside the crafts shed for a moment, wondering what had just happened. I felt really bad for tearing apart her quilt.

The summer finished out without an issue. I'd had an amazing time. Spending time with the kids gave me an appreciation and a passion to work in a school (and lord knows, you need passion to do this job). But I always wondered what happened to Mrs. Collins.

This morning, I finally found out. On the front page of the paper was the name of the old camp, and Mrs. Collins's picture. I had to re-read the article several times to fully understand it.

Camp owner abducts children.

Bodies of children found skinned alive.

Collins, an award-winning quilter, used the skins to stuff her quilts.

...casts a shadow over next week's upcoming quilting competition. 




 I thought you'd be too [drunk](http://www.reddit.com/r/drunknosleep) to remember. 




 They're always there. You just don't have to look at them in the dark. 




 When I was about 6 years old, my parents bought me a nightlight. They thought that it might help with the dreams that had driven me from my bed and into their room every night.

When I woke up from my nightmare, I could see the shapes illuminated around me. The way the arc of electricity jumped around the element gave it all the impression of swaying in the breeze. It wasn't the place I'd fallen asleep, it was a strange reflection of it. 

With the covers tucked tightly beneath my chin, I was sweltering hot. The wrinkled face of the man at the foot of my bed stared on with empty eyes. If I moved, he would see me. If I left the safety of my blanket, he would take me. I shivered with fear and with the strain of pulling the sheets.

Slowly the face shrank down beneath the edge of my mattress and out of sight. I could hear his rough clothes rustling as he slithered his way beneath my bed, pulling himself along with sharp, stained fingernails.

I leapt from bed, bounding outside his reach. In the dim flickering light I saw him there, licking his lips with a long black pointed tongue.

I reached out my hand and switched off the light. Then in the darkness, I crawled back into bed.

Creepy and well-written. Shame on you, sir. :P 




 My cousin Larry and I are from Oregon. Going to the beach is a bit of a production there. It isn't what the typical person pictures in their mind when they think of the word "beach." There's sand and water, but the similarities stop there. You can rarely see the sun through the thick fog, and instead of a bikini, you're more likely to find yourself wearing cold weather gear.

But Larry wanted to learn to surf, so I rented a wetsuit and strapped a board on top of my car. I'm sure I looked ridiculous driving there.

He struggled into the stretchy neoprene. It caused his arms to stick out at his sides a little like a doll. He looked so ridiculous. He started running toward the water.

"Hey Lar! Forgetting something?" I said, pointing toward the surfboard still strapped to my car.

He looked ridiculous, heading to the water holding a board that was twice as long as he was tall. I stopped him for a photo. "Say, 'Hang loose, brah!'"

"Hang loose bra!" He giggled, and held up some unrelated gang sign. I took the picture.

His smile faded, and he howled as his suit filled with the frigid water. It took him a long time to paddle the big board into the breakers. I could see him getting tired right away. I doubted he was having fun anymore now that he knew how much work this was going to be.

When I saw a larger swell pushing up and rising over his small shape, I tried to yell to him. The riptides had been pushing him closer and closer to the rocky jetty. His board raised above him, overbalanced and toppled him. I saw the board, but I couldn't find him in the frothy wave.

I waited a full minute. It felt like forever. Then I was scrambling up the rocks and out along the jetty. I just had to find him. Barnacles cut into my fingertips and salt water sprayed across my back. I was roughly to where I'd seen him. The white board was all the way to the beach already, floating with the fin in the air like a beached animal.

I still couldn't see him or anything else under the dark water. The waves slapped against the rocks and sent spray flying into the air. Then I heard a scratching coming from underneath me, inside the large rocks. Sure enough, an opening appeared in a lull between waves. I tried to stick my head in and look inside. I saw a foot, and a little white hand.

I dove after him. My clothes, wallet, phone, I didn't care. All that mattered was saving Larry.

He might have weighed a thousand pounds of dead weight. Blood ran freely from his forehead, and his skin was all a sickly blue-tinted white.

I clawed muscles and barnacles from the rocks trying to scurry my way up away from the accursed ocean. Larry's dead weight pitched me off balance and caused me to lose my footing. As I fell back into the ocean and a wave swept us apart, I realized that there were people on top of the jetty, watching.

I screamed to them as I broke the surface. I found Larry again, but just as I reached him, another wave swept us under. I just managed to hold onto his leg this time. I was starting to get tired. My jacket was tangling my arms, and the hiking boots that I wore made it so that I had to kick twice as much to stay afloat. Larry looked dead.

Then my foot touched the sandy bottom. I pushed him forward toward the beach. With my last remaining strength I dragged him out of the water. I was too cold to cry. Too tired to think. I pounded my fists on his chest. People gathered around me. I heard one of them say ridiculously, "That was a gnarly wipe out."

A man in a dirty yellow slicker mumbled "Down with the ship."

"Help me!" I screamed, but no one would come closer. They just watched from the edge of the circle. There was something wrong with their faces. They looked too much like Larry. Their skin was too blue. Too slack and lifeless...

Then someone was screaming and running toward us. An elderly man took in the image of Larry, before wrapping me in strong arms and tearing me away. He forced me to get warm. The circle of others were gone.

It was fifteen minutes before anyone else came to the beach. The man who rescued me stayed with me until the paramedics came. He told me "There was nothing you could have done."

"Nothing I could have done? What about all those other people who just stood there and watched?"

"You don't want to be talking about those others, ma'am," he said, seriously.

The doors of the ambulance closed and I was carried away.

 I bashed the cymbals with both hands as hard as I could. The lights, colors, sounds, movements... being on stage like this was bliss.

And then it was over. 

I hated the time after the show was over. Ben went off to find the girls he'd scouted from the front of the stage - it seemed like lead guitar and vocalists were always in demand. Beth, the bassist always found a party to go to as well. That left me.

After the main attraction, I stayed and packed up my drums. First I dried the beer and sweat and spit from the stained wood shells. Then, using a clean cloth dipped in alcohol, I'd clean the cymbals before stacking them in their moulded plastic vault.

Clean. Polished. Meticulous.

Tonight, however someone else was there with me after the lights came up. A waitress named Rose was mopping a suspicious runny mess off the floor near the stage. I couldn't look away. She was like something from a dream.

I still had more to clean up. Since Ben and Beth had gone, I'd be stuck packing up their equipment too, but for the first time in weeks since we'd been on the road, I didn't care.

"Hey, uh, what time do you get off?" I asked.

She flipped scarlet red hair from her face and took me in with a look of amused surprise. Her smile hinted that I was in. What she said next sealed it.

"Let's get out of here, drummer boy."

I followed her outside, and across the street. I don't know why I wasn't concerned that before long we were sloughing our way through the rain-dampened grass and brush. It was getting thick and hard to move through. She didn't seem to be having a hard time moving. It was like the woods were opening up in front of her.

There was light ahead - a campfire and a clearing. I emerged from the brush, soaked and covered with mud. 

In the center of the clearing was a fire in a stone pit. In front of the fire was Ben, to the one side was Beth, and to the other an empty, flat stone. Something told me that was for me.

The girl from the club turned around. Her red hair now faded to a gray straw-like mound that sat atop a disfigured, toothless face. I turned to run back into the woods, but two more women were emerging from the woods. Even the air seemed to bend in front of them, moving out of their way.

When I woke up this morning in the van, Beth and Ben didn't seem to remember anything that had happened the night before. The only proof I had that anything had happened, was an unread text from an unknown number ("Call me any time, Drummer Boy.") and a picture of three stones in a row.

 *"Where do you think it began, the idea that light could keep the monsters away? If anything, the darkness is your friend. The darkness will hide you. It's the light that will betray your secrets and sell you to the things in the shadows."

-Wayne K. Knowlton, 1890

When I was a kid, about 6 years old, my parents bought me a night light. They thought that it might help with the nightmares that had driven me out of my bed and into their room every night. My mother had found it second-hand at an estate sale. It was superman, except his red and blue costume was half chipped away, leaving bare white plastic underneath. He looked sick, and the anemic flickering light that glowed behind him just added to the feeling.

I woke up from my nightmare - not a night terror or sleep paralysis. Just a kid's nightmare that left him nervous and excited and imaginative. This time, I could see the shapes illuminated in my room. The way the arc of electricity jumped around the element gave everything the impression of swaying in the breeze. My room was transformed. It wasn't the place I'd fallen asleep, it was a perverse reflection of it. 

With the covers tucked tightly beneath my chin, I was sweltering hot. The wrinkled face of the man at the foot of my bed stared with empty eyes. If I moved, he would see me. If I left the safety of my blanket, he would grab my foot. I shivered with fear and with the strain of pulling on the blankets.

Slowly the face shrank down beneath the edge of my mattress and out of sight. I could hear his rough clothes rustling as he slithered his way beneath my bed, pulling himself along with sharp, stained fingernails.

I sprung from beneath the sheets and flew through the air, then landed on a stray toy in the middle of my floor. My ankle rolled, and spilled me onto the carpet. If I'd looked under the bed, I'd have seen him, licking his lips with a long, black pointed tongue.

Instead I reached out my hand and switched off the superman light. Then in the darkness, I crawled back into bed.

It was coming.

Outside, the sirens were howling their crescendos. Bill, my youngest, hadn't even been alive the last time it had happened. He was crouched in the corner of the concrete basement. A split had opened up in his jeans over one of the knees, and his hair hung long and unwashed. He pressed his palms over his ears and squeezed his eyes tightly shut.

How do you deal with something like this at six years old? It was hard enough for me at forty. And harder to still to know that I'd failed. Failed to get to shelter, to keep us safe, to keep us *alive*.

"Daddy, what are we doing here? We need to go home!" Sara, my oldest at ten, was tugging at my coat, trying to coax me back outside.

"We can't go back home, Sara. We're just going to wait it out here."

"But... look! Won't it come in through the windows? This doesn't look like a very good place..."

I scooped up Bill from the corner. I could feel his thin body shaking in my arms as he sniffled through tears.

"Well, we'll just make it better, okay? We've still got time."

The abandoned cellar didn't have much inside. It looked like construction of the house above had been given up on. Some bags of cement, old, gray 2x4's and nails were about it. It wouldn't feed us, but we might just make it through the first day if we could board it up tight enough.

I set Bill and Sara to work on the door. Hammering the boards would at least take their minds off of what was happening. I went to work on the narrow windows. The sirens had stopped. It was close now.

The boards went up more easily than I'd thought they would, and in only a couple of minutes, the three windows were boarded over. I brought my flashlight's beam back from the other end of the basement, and found them at the door, working together. The boards were nailed haphazardly to the center of the door. Huge gaps remained, big enough to fit my arm through. I'd have to tear them all down and start over.

But as I approached the door, hammer in hand, the first rays of sun cleared the horizon, and made their way between the scraps of wood. Bill shouted in pain, and my leg burned, dropping me to my knees. We were out of time.

The dawn was here.

But *what if it* **was** *true?*

Sure, you might not think it now. After all, you're reading the stories on your phone in a bathroom stall in the middle of the day.

But then tonight you'll make a late-night run to the grocery store to pick up some cheap wine and ice cream. Heading to your car, keys jangling, patting your pockets (keys, phone, wallet), you think you might hear shuffling footsteps, though no one else is around. As you go to pull out of your parking stall, you think for a split second that the lumpy shape of your gym bag in your rear-view mirror is the misshapen form of a killer, waiting to pounce.

Your mind's just playing tricks on you. You're jumpy. Maybe the wine will help.

You arrive at the store, and start making your way to the frozen food section, but before you make it there, you see a group of people standing clustered together in one of the aisles. It's right in front of the eggs. You can't see them anymore, but you're subtly reminded of a story you read that involved broken eggs. Now you're curious. What happened down the egg aisle? Was one of the huddled people starting to bend down to the floor? Did they notice you? Do you dare go back and investigate more closely?

The story was silly. Wasn't it? But... the people in the comments didn't seem to think so. Actually, you don't know quite enough about feline-human brain transplants to say whether they're plausible or not...

So as you pick out your frozen deliciousness, and head toward the wine section, you notice that your heart's beating little faster. You're a little more awake. Maybe you're noticing more than you would on a normal night because wasn't that story at least plausible? Plausible enough to pretend while you're alone at night that it was true? 









 I was having some trouble at college. You always hear story about how the roommate of the girl who commits suicide automatically gets straight A's. That's about all you ever hear about that girl, the one who walks in and finds the other one that way.

Being back home feels weird, but at first I didn't care. I just wanted to sleep in my own bed and stay in the dark away from everyone. For days.

Almost nothing changed at home since I left. The house was exactly the same. In fact, the only change was that mom didn't do her own vacuuming every day now, since she bought one of those stupid "Roomba" things from a Skymall magazine.

I slept most of the day and night. My parents worried about me. They brought me food and offered to take me places, but I always said no - the most I could manage was to read a few posts on Reddit while avoiding Facebook and the torrent of memorials from her recently acquired array of "best friends" there - before rolling over and falling back into a warm, dreamless sleep.

The police came to question me again. I took a shower for the first time in recent memory and faced the off-colored light of the day. My glasses were off and music was playing in my room. As I walked down the hall from the bathroom to my bedroom, I stepped onto something. It was *alive*. I squealed and retreated into my room, the creature hissed and squirmed off down the hall. I still don't understand why they bought a white Roomba for cleaning their white carpet.

The police said that there was new information, and asked me a bunch of weird questions about the room we shared and the rest of the dorm building. They kept asking if we knew of anyone who kept animals in the dorms, especially something like a snake or anything that laid eggs. I started to feel lightheaded and like the world was too bright for me.

I just got back to bed before I started hyperventilating. I'm exhausted. It sounds lame, I know - I was up for all of three hours. Now that I'm in bed, I'm being kept up by the hissing, whirring sound of the Roomba. It's trapped in my room, and I'm too lazy to get up and open the door.

The other thing that's keeping me awake is the strange way that Lucy was acting in the week before she died. She never was one to go out all the time, but that last week, she kept the curtains drawn and I don't think she ever left the room. Maybe there was something else wrong with her, like she was poisoned or...

Do Roombas climb walls?

 From Pierce the Veil's [Currents Convulsive](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/piercetheveil/currentsconvulsive.html), +/- a word. 









 Hi, /r/cryosleep.

My name is Alex, and I have a quirk. It's not-so-much a weird thing that I do, but more of a weird way that I am. Like a compulsion. I can't start something and then not finish it.

Now, I imagine that most of you are thinking *Gee, that doesn't sound so bad, Alex. I wish I could finish that pile of abandoned projects that I've built up over the years.* And normally, I'd agree with you. My quirk has gotten me a lot of things from numerous academic degrees to excelling in a career. It was my quirk that won me the girl of my dreams. 

It's carried me far, but it also sometimes gets me into trouble. Once, on a visit to Texas, I entered one of those "finish it and eat for free" contests, and nearly ruptured something unpronounceable. I had to change schools in 8th grade when I started a feud with a teacher that ended up in an elaborate set of plans to have her fired. Another time my parents walked in on me jerking off in my bedroom and despite making eye contact for a brief moment with both of them-

Come on, that joke was just too easy not to take.

So this is one of those times.

The idea started when I went to see Back to the Future in theaters. Among all the other lovable nonsense, there's a device called the "Flux Capacitor," a small machine that sits inside the DeLorean is basically responsible for moving the whole assembly through time. The Hollywood prop became the seed of idea that rattled around in my head for years.

When I was eventually assigned to the government's 4th-Dimension Research Wing, it was the idea of a small device which emitted a field around the user, that finally resulted in a break-through.

Let me back up. The 4-DRW is a joke. I mean "joke" in the sense that it does actually exist, but only with the purpose of continuing to exist. Its nuclear power core runs on the same sort of fuel that powers the careers of Reality TV stars. Researchers realized a long time ago that achieving time travel was far more complicated than they could hope to puzzle together and package into a useful tool. The "controlled" black hole had to be the worst failure that they had, but even that had the feeling that precedes the statement "At least we're trying."

Rather than cut funding, however, Uncle Sam got the right kind of confused and excited, and ultimately gave them a blank check. This is why the wing still exists. The goal changed from actually trying to produce time travel to selling the wing to the higher-ups. By the time I got in, it was basically an advertising firm with a couple of guys mixing vinegar and baking soda.

I'd imagine that it's the reason that they recruited me. In order to get the Film History degree I wanted, I had to take a bunch of basic science and math classes. I couldn't stand to have the loose ends like that, so after several years and piles of debt, I actually look like a scientist on paper, when really I just wanted to make movie props. I had a few bad but finished films by the time I graduated, and the guys on the "marketing" side of the 4-DRW saw them, found out about me, and brought me into the organization. They'd help pay off my crushing debt, as long as every quarter, I helped them make a convincing show for their bosses.

By now it should be easy to see that it was a complete and total accident that my device worked.

It was tradition to let the new member design the experiment. Remember, the point wasn't to do anything, just to create the appearance of doing things. I tried to start small, with near-light speed particle collision, but they told me that it had been done a few times before and that "If we spend like we're on a budget, they'll give us one."

So I basically decided to challenge the engineers. With Doc's Flux Capacitor in mind, I wrote the request for them to pack as much stored, chemical energy as they could into something you could put in your backpack, and then to harness it all at once into an arc of electricity through the air, all while managing not to start a fire or explode. Even though I was drunk as I wrote it, I specifically remember putting in big, red letters, "MUST NOT EXPLODE." And as long as I put my units and dimensions in the right place, our engineers were required to create it. The next week, a sleek-looking 3D-printed box was sitting in the middle of blast chamber Sierra's brushed titanium floor. It didn't look anything like Doc's, but hey, it was a prototype.

We all thought the thing was just going to blow up as soon as it was activated. At least we were going to get a good, bright explosion shot to show the bosses. Sierra is one of our medium sized spherical blast chambers, at just over a half-mile circumference. We set some modified exercise equipment in next to the box in order to show how people would eventually be able to use it to travel through time.

With the cameras and lights in place, we began. When the big red button was pressed, the box started to hum and vibrate. Something inside was spinning. it went on for a few minutes like that, with nothing happening, other than it making this weird noise that kept getting louder and louder. We could hear it through the blast shield, and that thing is thick.

Then, boom. Blue light filled the chrome chamber for a split second, and the sound was gone. The device and most of the workout equipment appeared to be gone as well. Right in the middle of the blast floor was a half-sphere carved right through the titanium, down into the lead. Like someone had taken a giant melon baller to it.

The bottom of the crater was filled with gray powder. The best I can figure is that it's like in the Terminator, where it makes a field around the person, only that field isn't like a perfect bubble, it's more like a wifi hotspot that gets less signal the further away you are from it. Right next to the device, almost everything moves. Around the edges, it's impossible to say when you'll end up, or you might end up only half-transported, leaving a thin reddish powder.

Tomorrow marks Trial 16. We've come a long way since that time. 15.3 had just a few bugs to work out, and only now I'm having thoughts of what it might mean if tomorrow Time Travel becomes a reality... and it's all my fault.

Help me, cryosleep. I can't stop.

Zooey was such a nice girl in the beginning. You'd always see her, head down, hair messy, rushing to her next class and avoiding the other kids in the hall. Xenial, always, but just a little too shy, maybe a little too strange to really fit in. When her mother died after their house caught fire, Zooey took it hard, and it pushed her into a dark place.

Valentine's Day, 1998 was when she had her first "outburst." Unsettling still, is the way she stood over the other me and smiled. There I'd been, taking out my frustration of the day out on her, saying the meanest things that my kid-brain could think to say about her drunk mother and then *boom*, Zooey hit me hard and fast with a power outside herself. Stranger still, was the way that my wound never quite fully healed. Right in that soft spot where my jawbone meets my neck, an angry red mark festered from that day on.

Quietly, Zooey was removed from the school, and digested into the bureaucratic system of foster care. People eventually forgot that she'd ever been there. 

One early morning, dew still soaking the lawns of the school, I saw someone standing outside the window. Normally, I'm not sure I would have noticed, except that they were waving their hands in a series of intricate dives and swoops. My eyes squinted against the rising sun, I could just barely see a pair of large spectacles glinting under a dark hood. Lazily, my brain worked to find an explanation. Keeping my eyes on their fluid motion, I raised my own hand. Just as the teacher called my name, the waving stopped.

I held my breath.

Hazy red points of light were now floating from their outstretched hands. Glowing, they revealed the visage of little Zooey beneath the cowl. Face pulled down in a grimace, she shoved the lights toward the building. Each of them grew as they went, sputtering into bitter hot flame. 

Dissonant ringing pealed from the fire alarms, and the flames tore through the halls in an instant. Cries of the children consumed in the inferno still haunt me on quiet nights. Before that day, I'd never understood why my scar looked like a burn. 

All I can think of now is the look in her eyes as she stood and watched, how a smile crept into the corners of her lips, and how it went away when she saw me alive. 




 So most of you have heard of /r/nosleep, a place for (mostly) short scary stories where the readers are not allowed to dispute how true they are. *Everything is true.*

There is a relatively new sub, called /r/cryosleep, started by a few of nosleep's mods with similar rules, but set in the future. This opens up a lot of new, fun opportunities for stories. *Everything is going to be true.*

**The Prompt:**

What is the future going to look like? Write it in a way that would be fun to share with a community that will pretend that it is, or is going to be, true.

Bonus points for anything including cryostasis.

 The first creature that I saw in this place... I never saw at all. 

It was before I'd found a light. The only way that I knew that it was there was by the sound of its breathing, stirring the emptiness.

I was naive. Inexperience in this endless cavern told me that the rules still applied. That an empty room in the dark was still empty.

"Hello?" I called, and my voice echoed back. Still, there was something there. I could hear the faint ticking raspiness of air moving through its open mouth.

At this time, I was still standing. Foolishly, I stretched my hand toward where I'd heard the noise. My feet carried me half-heartedly. Left foot forward, then the right one coming up to join it.

It must have been close. I could hear its breath with perfect clarity now, deep and huge. I could feel the cool air against my sides, pulling me toward it; smell the scent of decay on its warm breath. Each time it inhaled, there was a whirring, ticking sound like tiny ratcheting gears being wound.

It was my nose that betrayed me. The dead-smelling exhaust tickled my nostrils and brought tears to my eyes. I sneezed, and loudly. Before the echo even made its way back to my ear, a huge metallic clang tore the silence from the air. It felt at the time as though my sneeze had broken the world.

Behemoth footfalls, ringing one after the other, washed around the endless space. My ears split and popped from the noise. My hands, uncommanded, clawed into my ears, trying to pull the painful noise from them, but only managed to dull the edge a little.

Then it was gone. Wet drops poured from my ears as I lay in a pile on the smooth, cool stone.

---

The second creature that I saw in this place... wasn't a creature at all, it seemed.

A few days had passed - be it two or twelve, I couldn't say. My ears were still just useless pieces of flesh. Somewhere in the darkness, I'd found a light. It was a plastic cannister, about the size of a pop can. As it was shaken, a steel marble worked the fluid inside, and it glowed. One sense gone, one gained.

The cave was endless. The enormity of it truly set in once I could see it with my eyes. The dim, green glow showed only the hints of a high ceiling, and a long, flat, seamless floor as smooth as glass. Every hundred yards there sat a large support pillar, of concrete with bars and rods that jutted out at random.

It was near one of these that my lamp shone upon another person; the first person I'd known to share my prison. My mouth moved, and I felt myself call out, but only cold, oppressive silence met my ears. I walked closer still, nearly able to touch her with my outstretched hand. It was a woman. She seemed old and thin, wearing a faded red dress. Facing away from me and toward the pillar, her face was hidden behind thin black hair.

Then, my gaze fell upon her feet. They writhed and moved strangely under the shadow of her dress. I thought that it might have been some type of animal, a bug, a spider. Green light fell upon the truth, that her toes were shaped like long fingers with joints that were swollen and bent by arthritis. They milled and moved, groping and pulling at that faultless floor.

Her feet had turned her to face me. Dark, wrinkled skin sagged beneath cloudy eyes and from her neck. Her bones still glowed with former beauty, but age and this place had sapped her of her youth and its sweet goodness.

Her arms and legs were somehow switched at the shoulders and hips. She stared into me with those blank, wet and blind eyes. Or perhaps she heard my heart pounding, or my heavy breathing. I stepped away, and she bent forward, placing her hands (feet?) on the ground. Her gaze never left me. She started to walk, and those long, irregular hands came around her sides.

From somewhere in the folds of her dress, she pulled a small bag. I was backing away, but she was pursuing me, getting closer and closer. Her mouth was working, her lips twisting into words that I could no longer hear.

Two long fingers probed into the bag. Her feet slapped the floor rapidly, and she was upon me. Just before I could turn to run in earnest, she tossed a pinch of swirling dust into the air.

My lungs burned. I couldn't inhale - the very air had turned to fire. I couldn't run, I could only cough and spit and crawl. My face felt as though the skin had been removed and some gnarled hand tugged at the exposed nerves with every beat of my heart. Panicked, I couldn't force my eyes open to know where the harpy had gone.

The air gradually cleared. With painful sloth it came back to me in gulps. I lost consciousness, choked, and woke only to black out again. My body knew that I was about to die while my mind knew only fear and agony.

---

Broken, and burnt I lay, and resolved to explore the darkness no further. For what felt like weeks, I kept the chemicals inside the lamp glowing, keeping the shadows and what was in them at bay like a child's night light. Shaking its marble and liquid to recharge it. 

An internal debate raged within my wheezing chest: to let them claim me as I lay, or to try to preserve myself until the time that one large and hungry enough came for me. The light began to fade.

I laid on my back, and prayed for sleep. One cracked eyelid showed pale shapes moving, circling closer, just beyond where my lantern shone.  When the reaction inside it finally stilled, I felt sure that I would go, taken away on hundreds and thousands of pale, thin limbs by creatures that God knew better than to create.

Instead, it was... peaceful.

The only thing that moved was the fluttering of my heart. My fear ebbed like the tide until it crashed back down on my in a wave. A sensation of tingling crawled over my body. My eyes snapped open and I felt for the lamp. A jolt like a lightning bolt shot up my spine. I scrambled to my feet, and felt blindly for the light.

Another electric shock, like static discharged, but prolonged for several seconds jolted through my hand as it felt along the floor and my bare feet. My knees faltered, and my knees bore the pain too. My limbs moved on their own, and an errant hand or foot - I couldn't say which - struck the lamp and sent it glowing, spinning along the bare floor. I gripped it, rattled it, and held it up to show my attacker.

There was nothing and no one, and yet again a wave of torture came. Each time I pulled a pained limb away, another part of me was sacrificed in its stead. I shed my thin clothes and stood on them, but it brought no relief. Next, I ran. The shocks became stronger, making their way up, boiling my blood and out arcing out through my panting mouth head and twitching arms. The floor itself was *made* of electricity, it seemed, and there was no escape.

As I ran, scrambled, wrestled, screamed, a thought pushed its way into my brain. A memory from before of a lab rat that said "You never, ever get used to" the feeling of electric shock. I could only hope that someone would turn it off, but soon, even hope was replaced with pain.

It took a very long time. Between exhaustion and shock, I suddenly felt sure that I was passing from life. And then, the pain was gone.

It was bliss.

I collapsed against the base of one of the pillars, and smiled. Tears of joy streamed from my eyes, and down onto my naked chest. I tried to rub my tired, numb legs, but my hands never came. I examined my hands under the lantern, and watched as it struck my thigh, my chest, then my face.

I felt nothing, not the pain of the floor, or the tears on my face.

---

I walked, mute, deaf and numb, straight ahead into the blackness. My relief at the subsidence of the pain had worn itself out, and I felt as empty inside as I did on the surface. I walked for miles. It was all I could do. In the dim green light of my lantern, I could see my bare feet as they carried me forward by dumb reflex.

I had no feeling in my legs, or anywhere. It was hard to keep my balance. Even as stumbled and fell, I had to rely on my eyes to tell me which way was up; had to watch my hand to know that it was placed on the ground, pushing me up. The light faded. Either it was growing weaker or I was losing interest in shaking it. What point was there? Each new darkness I wandered into would surely be the same as the last. Eventually, lights began to flicker in front of my eyes and I was seeing stars. 

But then, one of the stars far in the distance shone more brightly and illuminated several of the steel and stone pillars. Lights. They weren't sensory misfires, there was something ahead. My pace, the march of a doomed man, quickened to a jog. The lights continued to fly high in the cavern, resembling flares or fireworks. I thought of the times that we'd bought roman candles during the summer holidays. My eyes strained to see anything below them, in the area lit by their brief glow. My breath quickened at the thought of seeing another person's face illuminated in the distance.

In the corner of my eye, I took in that one of the pillars was beginning to move. Something huge had knocked into it, and sent stone and scraps of metal flying in a cloud of dust and debris. I changed course too late, and a fragment of rock as large as a mattress swiped my left side.

Dust cloyed the flashing, flying lights above and just a short ways ahead. I rolled my body to allow myself to see what was happening. I could just see objects moving through the clouds. Hundreds of snakelike creatures writhed in a ball. Each one was several feet around. Beneath the ball, I could see four appendages, and realized that the snakes were in fact connected as one creature, towering fifty feet or more in the air. It was making its way closer to me, its massive weight evident in the slow movement of its legs.

Some of the beast's appendages were longer and more slender, tipped with white lights that winked on and off, but all of its many arms were being flung about in wild anger. Just as I stood and turned to run, my eye was drawn to a dark spot on the pillar behind the beast. A doorway.

It smashed into another pillar, this one very near me. My ankle was bent at an odd angle, and I could see my breath stirring the dust in front of me, but I felt no pain, only a wrong-ness like one feels when walking with one foot on a curb and the other in a street. I hobbled my way toward the next pillar, hoping to take refuge behind it.

I went as fast as I could, but I was sure that the naked, slimy, white arms of the thing was right behind me. If I ventured a look back over my shoulder, I might lose my balance, and then the thing would be on top of me.

I reached the next pillar, and hugged onto the corner, trying to conceal myself behind it. Looking back, I saw that the monster had stopped, and no longer pursued me. Up out of the center, in the top, parting the knotted tentacles like a bee leaving a rose, a larger appendage rose up. This one was jet black, and opened at the end, revealing long, needle-sharp teeth dripping with liquid.

it snaked down across the floor, toward a small speck of something green near where I'd fallen; my lantern. The only other source of light, drowned out by the beast's strobing stadium lights. The large snakelike mouth struck the ground around it, and its sharp teeth sank deep into the stone floor. The other tentacles braced against the floor while the great, black neck strained and stretched, but it was the floor that gave first, letting up a large, round plug of stone, which was promptly swallowed. The black head of the thing retreated back into the center of the tangle of other tentacles, their waving movements having calmed into a gentle swaying again.

I wanted so badly to run away, but one thing held me in place. The doorway. It seemed like it was hardly possible that after all this time, that I could have finally found a way out, and yet in my mind there was no where else to go. I had to try.

The beast made its way back in front of the pillar with the door, apparently standing guard. I made a large circle and came up behind the huge pillar. It was identical to all the others, a mish-mosh of metal scraps, jagged rocks and cement nearly fifty feet across at the base, but knowing the beast, and possibly a way out was just on the other side made this one seem much smaller.

I crawled around the edge, and the things swirling tentacles came into view, reaching up toward the faraway ceiling, the longer ones tipped with those blinding white lights. I stayed low and hugged the side of the wall, just hoping that the beast could only see light, and that I could stay hidden in the darkness for long enough.

I was halfway around the side of the pillar, and was still alive. The doorway was just another fifty feet ahead in the center of the side facing the monster. I decided to look away, focusing on my hands. Without my other senses, looking away almost made the thing disappear completely. In a few moments, I was at the corner.

Here, I could hide part of my body behind a large disk made of jagged metal which stuck out of the cement wall. I paused for a moment to plan my route forward. I would have to go around the disk, and then scurry twenty five feet along the wall, only ten feet or so from the feet of the guardian. I didn't so much as look back.

I was around the metal barrier, crawling, crawling. Twenty feet. Crawling, I looked away, staring at my right hand which traced the line where the flawless floor met the unfinished cement. I glanced at the door. Fifteen feet. A sickly white limb, with blue veins coursing beneath the slimed translucent skin lazed through my vision. I closed my eyes to stop myself from staring at it. I arched my back, sure that one of the tentacles would smash me like a bug, or those long, transparent fangs would pick me up, without my so much as knowing.

I stopped crawling, and opened my eyes. My right hand was through the doorway, and without knowing it, I had turned myself. I had made it. I glanced one last time at the beast, and saw that its black head was snaking back through the mass of wormy arms again in a smooth, lubricated motion. With my eyes closed, I hadn't noticed that my knee had struck a piece of metal debris, knocked from the tower by the beast earlier. The noise had doomed me.

I stood and ran into the doorway, and found a spiralling set of black stairs lining the walls. My leg gave out, and I dove, face-first into the bottom stair. I frantically clawed up the stairs, toward the orange light coming from above me. I could feel and hear nothing, but I was sure that I was screaming.

The wall above me erupted. Angry appendages entered the stairwell, probing blindly, looking for the intruder. I stopped. From below, the black head, mouth closed snaked in. I was curled into a ball, just below the first landing, next to the wall. Above me, the tentacles, and below me the head. I couldn't move, and I couldn't make a sound. I blacked out before I even realized that I'd been holding my breath.

When I came to, the arms and head of the thing had retreated from the stairwell. I was alone, bathed in the orange glow coming from above. As quietly as I could, I crawled, one step at a time. It must have taken me hours. Finally, I could see the top! An opening in the wall, where an orange, electric glow shone in was just another few landings above me. I crept faster, desperation wriggling its way into my movements.

I don't know what happened, but suddenly I was aware of a vibration and the whole stairway was shaking and vibrating. I cast a glance down over the edge, and saw the flashing lights of the creature, its strong white tentacles pulling it through the hole it had made and at an unfathomable speed up the center of the stairwell. It took up the entire area, wall to wall, and shot up toward me. In the center, I could see that black mouth opened wide.

I ran with my one good leg and my hands in a sort of tripod up the last few flights, and rushed out of the opening, turned to the side and dove out of the way of the beast. In a blur, the white beast, now colored orange by the lights outside shot away from me. Without any hesitation, it stepped on and demolished a 1980's Volkswagen Rabbit, and shot its head up, snatching the glowing bulb from the top of the street lamp. When that one was gone, it continued on down the rain-drenched street, devouring whatever light it could find.

I was free. Oh god.

*It was all real.*

---

These words are wasted. I know.

I've only written them in case some time in the future, another person comes along, so that they'll know what happened. That there was another who survived. I can't explain why the hellish world below this one was suddenly caused to hemorrhage over into ours, where the beasts went once they'd ravaged our great society, or whether they'll be back again.

I can only tell you that I saw the place that they came from.

And it was almost empty. 




 /r/nosleepworkshops has come under new management. If you're a fan of horror and helping writers, check it out! 









 Fosters alarm blared in his ears. He slapped aimlessly at the floor until he finally managed to contact the snooze button. Something wet had soaked the dirty floor and silk lining of Fosters resting place. As he lay sprawled over the edge of his coffin, a drip of groundwater dripped onto the back of his neck.

Gotta fix that leak. he spoke to himself, voice clipped and muted by the small, dirt-walled space. He sighed. Another day. It got harder and harder to wake from the dead with each one that passed.

He thrust a decomposed, rotting hand through the ground above him, into the moonlight. Fumblingly, he pulled at the grassy ground above his grave. It was easier to get a grip on the marble headstone, but to get there, he had to dislocate a shoulder. Each time he did it, the socket became a little more worn. Somewhere along the line, theyd decided to put the marker at the head instead of the feet, and zombies like Foster started their day with a little more of a struggle, as they cursed the well-meaning folks whod buried them.

He shambled toward the front gate of the cemetary, a large, black ornate eyesore of ivy and roses.

Hi George!

Hey Foster. Got plans tonight? Georges mostly skeletal hand held up a bag of green, writhing worms. I got these from a friend in Reedsville.

Without a digestive system, working liver, kidneys or totally intact nervous system, the stimulants that theyd used in life were no longer effective.. The only way to get a buzz was through the use of parasites. The offer was enticing, ut Foster had other plans.

Sorry, I cant. Got a new lead to look into over in Springfield.

Really? Sorry, I mean... Thats great, Foster. I hope you find her. Hey, if it doesnt work out this time, half this bag is yours.

Thats a deal. See you at sunrise.

Foster pushed open the gate which produced a massive shriek from its rusty hinges. He shambled down the main road, then turned left toward Springfield.

***

The first sign to greet a person as they entered Springfield was the one reading NO VACANCY at the 24/7 hotel. It was run by a little blue ghoul with big glasses named Leroy. The hotel wasnt actually full, and hadnt been for more than 120 years, but hed kept the sign working as it doubled as the name of his new business. The undead living out in the cemeteries preferred to do their business with Leroy when they could, rather than go into town. The ghoul carried little everyday things like embalming fluid, bandages and stitches, and caulking (which Foster would need to remember to buy on his way back), but he could get just about anything in a couple of days if you were willing to fill out the order paperwork.

It was Leroy who had given Foster the tip - somebody new recovered from near ground zero claiming that their last name was Ruff.It wasnt a definite match - theyd found others before. In the hundred years since the bomb had dropped, theyd found thousands of dead. Statistically, some were bound to have the name. It didnt stop Fosters steady shambling past NO VACANCY, though.

When they found her, hed be there. Hed finally be able to take his wife home to the grave beside his.

***

Wanna buy some maggots, pal? A zombie with rotting, squirming flesh asked, walking close enough to smell out of a dark alley. Foster shied away, and scowled. Whats his problem? asked the maggot dealer, as Foster shuffled away.

Hed always hated coming into the city, preferring to stay in the secluded country as much as possible. There was only one thing that was in the city that Leroy couldnt get: fresh brains.

Foster pushed through the doors of the busy cafe, and spotted a waitress he knew. Her hands were full of plates and empty bottles, but she nodded her charred skull toward the back table.

Lindsay was an anomaly in Fosters world. Being killed in the nuclear blast of course meant that she was also fully skeletal. All the ones they recovered were now. Freshly out of the rubble, these newly dead were blank slates. The ghouls had taken it upon themselves to reintegrate them. It wasnt always possible.

She was one of the few freshly dead that Foster genuinely had no problems with. She was sweet as ever and worked two jobs to save money for a little plot like the ones in his cemetery. And she always remembered just how Foster liked his brains; bloody and raw, with just a dash of formaldehyde on the edge of the plate.

As soon as she could, she hurried to his table in the furthest corner, carrying a fresh plastic bottle of Johannes   Johanness finest embalming tonic. She set it down and with quick bony fingers, signed the words Single or double, today, Honey?

With his own slow movements he curled his hand to say, Double, thank you. The Recovery Clinic is not open for one hour.

Recovery? That sounds exciting! Your signing is getting better. Her hands moved so fast that the bones clicked against each other. It made a mockery of his own brain dead hands, but he took the compliment anyway.

***

The entrance to the Recovery Clinic was actually an ancient train station, converted in the Twenty-First Century to use with the Subway, and housed enough office space to support the citys day-to-day metro operations. If you were claiming or adopting a corpse, you out-processed them through the station.

The underground tunnels were the only way to get close enough to the heart of the city and ground zero. Ghouls excavated as far in as their immunity would take them, but the fallout would still be too great for the areas closest to the blast site to be unearthed for years to come. The intermediate area housed the clinic itself, where bodies were reassembled and prepared for their assimilation back into society. The underground tunnels were the only way to enter the area with safety from the radiation above.

Foster took a slip of paper with a number, and found one of the empty dilapidated leather seats. Hed always liked the smell of the dust down here. A few other zombies were waiting in the seats with him, a mother with quite a bit of flesh remaining sat, while her children, both newly dead, took turns poking an old sleeping skeleton wrapped head-to-toe in bandages. Each time that they did so, and his old bones began to stir, the pair would run away with a clatter of small bones on the stone tiles.

The car sounded far off down the tunnel and the group took to their feet, including the bandaged skeleton who took a few minutes to adjust his hips into place before standing.

The single-car subway train pulled into the ancient platform a little fast, and bumped into the barricade. The ghouls and zombies standing on board had to take a large step to regain their balance at the sudden stop.

In the conductors seat was a yellowed and decaying member of the undead. The damp tunnels had been unkind to him. A tremor shook his hand and threatened to break the last remaining strings of flesh holding his arm together.

Hey Gory.

Hi-i-i, F-f-foster. B-back ag-g-g-gain?

Hopefully for the last time. Trying not to get my hopes up.

O-o-kay, then. Ho-old on, the b-b-breaks are a little w-worn t-tod-day.

Thanks, Gory. Dont work too hard.

Foster was sure the old corpse hadnt heard him, but took his place in the back anyway. As the train car began to pull away from the station, he wondered how many times hed made this ride now.

***

From start to finish, the tunnel took about five minutes to traverse. At three minutes in, Gory sneezed. He made to wipe the rot and snot from his upper lip, but found that the last tendon had given out, separating his arm at the elbow. He could only manage a choked scream as they sped into the corner without brakes. the ancient wheels finally separated, and the car shot straight through the cement wall, into a parallel tunnel and stopped dead against the solid earth behind it.

Foster unstuck himself from the other corpses in the front of the train car. The bandaged skeletons parts were everywhere. Gory was just a pile of dried meat, ragged clothes and crushed bone. The woman was starting to fuss about, collecting the bones of her children into their separate piles. Foster rubbed a pain in his belly, where he found a small bone had punctured his stomach, letting the brains hed eaten earlier out and staining his suit. The woman snatched to bone from him and went back to her task.

Foster opened the door and stepped onto the gravel floor of the tunnel. There was a light shining in the distance, possibly from above the ground. He pulled his suits collar up over his neck and headed toward the light.

Dont go into the light! the woman called from the train. You could be exposed!

Dont worry. Ill just go see if theres anyone who can help, then Ill come right back.

A short ways down the tunnel he found a ladder built into the wall that led to a circular portal above. Bright light shone down into the tunnel. Hed have to make this quick. 

...Relatively quick.

On the surface, high-powered work lights illuminated the entire area. Foster was blind. He picked a direction at random and began limping.

Blleeuuugh! he moaned. The sensation of being in the bright light was uncomfortable. He put his arms out in front of him, reaching for anything to regain his orientation. Someone screamed.

Get him back in line!

What the-? Hes a zed!

Where the hell did he come from?

Get it the fuck out of here!

Fosters blind stumbling had brought him to the edge of the lit area. He couldnt see what was being lit, but there were people in the darkness all around. Lots of them, all standing still like a wall of silhouettes. Someone pushed him while grabbing his arm tightly. A big ghoul was hurrying him out of the area.

Fosters head spun, nearly falling off. He could still see the line of people with ghouls moving back and forth keeping them in place. Tall buildings rose around them on every side.

Buildings that should have been destroyed a hundred years ago.

***

When the ghouls had finally let Foster go, hed been allowed to go to the Recovery Clinic and check for the remains. Someone had already claimed them. The bones theyd found were a Jeanette Ruff. Fosters wifes name was Alicia.

He didnt get home until well after dawn, but the worry of his skin drying out managed not to bother him. He forgot to buy caulking. George had gone under long ago. 

All that Foster could think of was the line of humans - real, living humans, and the city of buildings theyd always believed to be destroyed.

Mona's heavy armor shuffled softly as she ran. The plates were each muffled by supple pieces of leather sewn between them. It was truly masterfully made, and it occurred to her that she hadn't made a sound yet; hadn't heard a sound yet - the others running beside her through the trees were just as silent.

No one in the group had said a word since leaving the monastery they'd used as shelter. Not one word, and yet they each seemed to know where exactly they were supposed to be. They knew where every other person was supposed to be be as well, in order for the formation to work, and that was what was terrifying to Mona. This was her first mission, her first charge to the field of battle to appease her God, Tempus, and despite all the training and preparations, she was still convinced that the clerics to her right and to her left knew what she should be doing better than she did.

Then they were out of the trees, and there was no more room in her mind for doubt or uncertainty. There was only war all around them. The followers of Tempus had the upper hand against their enemy rolling down the side of the valley deep into the flank of their wearied enemy. The militia force they'd been battling further up the valley had done so well, using their superior knowledge of the twists and turns and secret passageways through the mountains to narrow the gap in their pitifully small numbers and the attacking force's army of thousands.

Pressed down into the relative openness of the valley, however, without the aid of the priests and priestesses, they would scarcely have lasted through the night.

Mona felled one of the attackers before they even saw her coming, by harnessing the added speed from running downhill into a mailed elbow that she drove into the base of a skull. She felt the bones lift away from each other and the muscled soldier collapsed on the ground. Her eyes lingered a second too long on the face of the man, and another screamed and charged her with a nasty barbed spear still dripping with gore.

Mona managed to bring up her shield just in time to deflect the thrust. Her training guided her motions, but she was distracted by the dirty round face that was contorted in rage where her kindly weapons instructor's face should have been. She dodged a wild blow from her opponent's shield, and without needing to look, ducked low enough for the spear to come back over her. Once it had cleared, she sprung from her low position, pressing with all her considerable strength driving the spear far out to the side. Her opponent's flank was open, and she plunged her sword through the gap in his armor, between the ribs and into his heart and lungs.

The maneuver had shifted her battle helmet uncomfortably. Another soldier had targeted her from a few feet away, however, and there wasn't time to adjust. She flipped it off with the back of her hand, and confidently strode toward her attacker.

The din of battle took on a different sound as arrows fell in a blanket across the battlefield, fired from enemy archers hidden in the shadows of the trees. Mona's attacker had taken one in the lower back, the sheer pain of it, drove him to his knees. A second later, her face burned as another whizzed by close enough for the stiff feathers to open a cut across her cheek. She brought her shield up, to account for the gap in her armor. She'd never taken her eyes off the man, still on his knees, clawing desperately to free the arrow from his back, but his armor's inflexibility wouldn't allow him the relief. A slash across his throat ended his agony.

To her left, the militia forces were regrouping, the attention taken off of them, and placed onto the greater threat. Back up the hill where she'd come, five points of yellow light were hovering in the hands of the priests, before being thrown onto the holy warriors below. One found their way to Mona, the small sphere growing to surround her. Another volley of arrows launched and stopped dead at the edge of the magical barrier. The ground forces were broken, it was only a matter of sweeping up that was left. Some of her brethren charged into the forest on the opposite bank, toward the unarmored archers. All told, the slaughter was over in minutes.

Mona looked over the faces of the men and women fallen in battle. Tempus would be pleased at their performance; few of their brothers and sisters were among those on the bloody ground. She set about healing the members of the militia who still clung to life, and finishing off those from the invading army. Mona fetched a magical amulet from around her neck and rubbed it with the thumb of her left hand. It started to glow and pull against its chain. She could still only perform minor healing spells, but the amulet's magic would aid her in bringing relief to those with more serious wounds.

Laney had hoped that she was finished crying. Past all that.

*You're a grown-up now,* her mother had told her. That was a full year ago, but this night, for the first time, she might have felt like one. Laney studied her appearance in the full-length mirror once again. Her mother's gardening cloak hung around her shoulders, still a bit too large. Its silvery seams glimmered with enchantments, the pinnacles of the stitching ended elegantly in rosebuds. Another rose, this one black, adorned the band in her stark white hair.

She looked ready for anything. Almost.

She skipped back to fetch a sword from the bed. With its belt slung over her shoulder, the jade scabbard dragged and rattled on the rough-hewn wooden floor.

---

Standing at the gate, Laney traced the intricate patterns of the wrought-iron with a finger. She'd walked by a thousand times before, never paying any mind to them. Roses, for their beauty. And thorns to keep children out of the cemetery beyond. Laney wasn't a child any longer.

There was no lock to be seen, but she felt something in her chest tugging her forward. She touched the delicate, silver-inlaid hilt to the center of the gate, and the black vines around it came to life, spiraling outward from the center. The silver in her sword and robe began to glow, the ancient magic of the strange town yawning to life.

Inside the gates, soft sounds could be heard in the darkness. Dragging. The smell of fresh, wet dirt, and another - deeper and muskier - of decay.

Laney lowered herself to one knee to light a lamp from her pack. Focusing on the wick, she didn't see the dark shapes moving in the soft light of the match. She held the lamp high. Higher, higher. It was plucked from her gloved hand. All around her, green stalks twisted and writhed around her, their thorns just grazing her robe. The silver glowed brightly in resistance. Her lips pressed into a thin smile.

She gripped the glowing hilt tightly in her left hand, and pulled the green steel blade clear of its scabbard. The roses around her hissed their distaste like great serpents.

With dexterous grace, she mowed them down as fast as they came.

[The Ghost Thief](http://www.kimsokol.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/GhostThief.jpg) by [Kim Sokol](http://kimsokol.tumblr.com/)

The girl opened her pack and extracted a fat green bottle wrapped in fur. It was one she'd used several times before for this exact dark purpose. The crumbling cork slid loosely out of the opening. She crouched next to the lifeless body at her feet, her tight leather armor creaking softly as she moved. With a muffled word and a mysterious swish of her hand, the air in front of her glowed softly, then faded.

With a frustrated swear, she repeated the charm. The light glowed a little brighter this time and Jarod, standing in the shadows, thought that he could just see the outline of a tortured face being framed in the glow. This spell faded as well, and the girl swore louder. Jarod couldn't see why the blonde thief would even bother. This area had hosted several wars throughout the years and remains were plentiful; one only needed to look around the cave that they were in to know that. Wasting an enchanted bottle to capture this spirit wouldn't bring her any fortune, especially from here. No, this was something else.

On the third try, the thief's spell illuminated a satisfied smile on her face and caused Jarod to slink behind a pile of bones. The face, glowing in the darkness, was stretched and almost as thin as the skulls lining the walls. She began to reel the spirit into the bottle with one waving hand. Obviously clumsy with magic, her brow pinched in concentration. Jarod thought how easy it would be to incapacitate the girl right now. He had cause; the body she knelt over had belonged to his mentor, a silver-robed mage that had earned some renown in a long-ago age. Therein lied the reason that Jarod stayed his attack. The apprentice felt that he had long ago gleaned all he could from the old man with his strict code and laws, and finding him dead at a cutpurse's hand lifted his spirits.

Her work was complete. She carefully wrapped the glowing bottle and set it into her bag with the rest of her collection, considered the cavern around her and set out, her new shadow creeping along the tunnels behind her.

The town of Zale, where Jarod and his master had come was due east. The girl struck a path to the south through the woods. He admired how at home she seemed to be, even as she avoided the main paths. Early on, he had summoned a sphere of silence around himself so that the girl wouldn't hear him breaking branches and twigs. Her own magic seemed to be grounded in her skill and dexterity; he hadn't heard her once. For reasons he couldn't fully explain, he was captivated by the girl; her beauty seemed to grow with each obstacle she overcame.

He began to feel the length of the trek taking its toll. Briars and branches had claimed the hem of his robe, and his cloth shoes, once cobalt blue were now brown and caked with mud. His mark emerged from the trees onto a wide dirt road. Her pace had never slowed in the brush, but now she clipped along even faster.

The road ended in a wide, flat valley that housed a community of small farms. In the center of the valley, a group of huddled buildings stood above than the rest. The sun was setting on the hills framing the village. Against its glow, the girl's silhouette disappeared into one of the buildings. That was fine by Jarod.

For twelve years the young mage had studied under his old master. Creatures, places, artifacts, scrolls, tomes... It had been an endless cycle, a tedious life. He intended to study the girl in her own environment, untainted by his observation, as he would have studied a Pixie or a Bogg Toad. He wasn't in search of companionship; he only wanted to know her, while enjoying the power that anonymity afforded him. That power swirled and mixed with the feeling of freedom inflating in his chest as he found his way to the cluster of buildings.

The only building with light and activity coming from within it was an inn that doubled as a tavern and a small trading post. A squat, mustached man frowned at Jarod's undeniably impractical and dirty clothes from behind a wooden counter. In the next room was a tavern where hardy farmers were gathered around handmade tables where they were loudly sharing cups and tales.

Jarod's hand made a subtle movement and the mustached man's frown became dulled and the light left his eyes. "I'll be needing a room and clothes. You don't need to know my name or my business, only that I wish to be left alone." He set a pile of coins on the wooden countertop. "I am quite sure that this will be sufficient to cover my stay. My key, please."

---

A short time later, Jarod descended the stairs wearing black pants and boots with a forest green traveling cloak. The noise from the small pub rose up the steps to greet him. Ignoring the man at the counter, he grabbed the handle of the door to leave. Jarod released the handle and his hand slowly dropped to his side. He turned his focus back to the bar. Standing there, next to a group of men at the table, was the one he'd been following. He walked into the bar and pulled out an empty chair at one of the tables - the only empty chair in the room. The strangers stared at him for a moment, but Jarod's gaze was fixed on the girl as she went from table to table, laughing and joking with the men she obviously knew. Her dexterity and finesse were obvious here as well, and her beauty more so. Two of the others at Jarod's table went back to their stories. The third tapped him on the shoulder with enough force to .

In normal circumstances, the mage would have resented the uncalled for touch, but the discomfort of his clothes was a constant reminder that he was in disguise. He swallowed his discomfort and looked toward the man. A thick beard was soaked with mead, and he smelled like dirt and sweat. "She's somethin' huh?"

"Something... Yes. Do you know her?"

"Sure do. That's the girl I'm gonna marry."

"You are her betrothed?"

"Well... no. She doesn't actually know me jus' yet. Gotta work up a little courage is all."

"You've never actually met her, then?"

"Oh, I met 'er. She... might not 'a got my name right..."

"I see."

"She's such a cute li'l thing. Her family's got a farm back toward the red hill." The young man tried to focus through his inebriation in order to take in Jarod's appearance. Before he could finish, the girl had appeared beside the table.

"Hi, Bill. Mort." She nodded to the old men at the table. "Another drink for both of you?" Both nodded and went back to their conversation. "And you two... well, hello. I don't believe I've seen you here before" she said, looking at Jarod. "Brothers?" Jarod glanced at the other man ogling the girl. Thick arms and shoulders flanked a barrel-chest with a wild blond beard hanging over it. The two could not have been more dissimilar.

"Ah, no. Afraid not. I'd like to purchase a drink for my new friend..." Jarod dragged out the last line, hoping that the lovestruck man at his side would offer a name. It didn't come, but the object of his affection kindly ignored the awkward pause. 

As she left, the the oldest man at the table leaned over toward Jarod. "Ye don' want to be gettin' yer hopes up with tha' one," he slurred. "Strange, she is."

"Hear tell she's a necker-mancer," the fourth man whispered loudly enough to hear over the din of the crowded room.

"She ain't no necromancer! She's a *collector*. She collects things 'n puts 'em up in her ol' man's barn.

"Well, her ma an' 'er ol' man are weird ones too. Whole family of 'em out by Red Hill."

"Point bein'... Ye're best to leave 'er alone." At this, the bearded man looked slightly crestfallen. The barmaid arrived with the drinks and smiled at everyone else at the table before locking her gaze onto Jarod. For several seconds, she just stared. Jarod shifted in his seat and felt himself start to sweat. The moment passed and her smile returned before leaving.

"She winked at me!" shouted the bearded man. She certainly hadn't, but no one was cold enough to correct him.

"You said that she's a 'collector,' what did you mean by that?"

"Naw, I said she a '*necker*-man-"

"Shut up, Mort! I already told ya, she's not a necromancer." The man turned back to Jarod. "Her an' her family aren't from here. They came from some place I never heard of. That was 'bout four, five years ago now. So they show up outta the blue, and they buy a farm and then stuff just start disappearing."

"Stuff?"

The blonde walked close by the group's table and the man telling the story lowered his voice, ominously. "Yeah, stuff. Had about five of us out in the woods picking this certain kind o' mushroom. We sit down for some lunch and when we get to movin' again, no' one of us can find our bags. A whole morning's work, gone."

"Oy, I 'ad somebody trod off with me flask once. D'ya think-"

"I r'member yer flask well enough, Mort. I r'member 'cause I saw it fall in the lake when we was out fishin'." Bill shot him a look to silence him, but the man was occupied trying to pull something out of his pockets. "As I was sayin'- er... what was I sayin'?"

"So you think they stole your mushrooms?"

"Not just the mushrooms. People started to notice they were losin' their stuff from all over town. Their old stuff. Like Grappler's gran gave 'im a locket from 'afore the war, Brawn had a set o' armor his pa gave 'im. I 'ad a nice knife from me ma... used it fer cuttin' carrots. Stuff that was right inside peoples' homes, an' it just went missin'."

"You think she's got somrthing to do with it?"

"Well I dunno if it's *her* exactly's doin' it, but she's got the stuff in her old man's barn, that's fer sure."

"Yeah 'n my flask! It were green 'n fat."

"Was it glass?" Jarod asked.

"Yeah! How'd you guess that?" the man asked in wonder.

Without pausing, he responded "If it had been metal, surely the two of you would have been able to recover it when it fell into the lake." Bill laughed loud and drunkenly. Jarod followed the girl with his eyes for a while. "So, Bill, if everything is there in the barn, why hasn't anyone gone in and taken it back?"

Bill looked around him, lowered his head so that the tip of his beard just dipped into his cup of ale, but didn't lower his voice whatsoever. "It's haunted."

Jarod perked up at this, pulling his gaze from the girl. Mort burst out, "See! That's what I' been tryin'a say. She's a necker-"

"She ain't!"

"Well then what's that I seen her doin'-"

"You ain't seen shit, Mort."

"Please," Jarod ventured softly. "I'd like to hear what Mort here has to say."

It was Mort's turn to scowl at Bill, and he relished in the moment for a long second. "As I say. I seen the girl ou' in the woods one night, 'n I think she might'a been hunting 'cause there were something dead by 'er. So's she stops 'n pulls out this little bottle - blue, like the sky - and starts wavin' her hands and sayin' some kind o' spell. Then outta nowheres, that dead thing's spirit starts floatin' up, glowin' real bright in the dark, and she stuffs the thing into her blue bottle. I think that dead thing was a man... but I never went close enough to see. Ye' ever hear anything like it?"

"Actually, I have."

"Told you!" shouted Mort.

"Now hold on! The mister din't say boo 'bout necromancers yet."

"Sorry, Mort. I don't think that she is a necromancer. I don't think that she's much of a magician at all, actually. There are simple charms that one can procure to give the power to capture a departed soul in an enchanted container. Now, do you know of why she might want to do such a thing?" Jarod allowed their silence to linger a moment before answering his own question. 

"Because she's a collector."

A smile spread back into Bill's face. "Yeah!"

The souls that she had taken were nearly worthless, but they might have contained sentimental value. However, if he could get inside the barn where she kept it, he may yet find some artifacts of worth.

Oddly, not a single customer had left the tavern yet. The starstruck young man had fallen asleep, a line of drool was strung from his beard to the table, and nearly hung to the ground.

Jarod stood, his drink was only half-finished, but he felt his balance waver for a moment.

The cool air of night blew across his body. He supposed for a moment that he should have asked where exactly the barn was, however it wasn't necessary. The mage had other means. The soft orange lights of the tiny town shrank behind him. In the darkness, he thrust his hand high into the air, feeling for the pulse of magic. Puzzled, Jarod lowered his hand. He felt magic all around him.

In the field beside him he heard rustling. It was getting closer. The young mage raised his hands in front of him, ready to react with fire and wind to whatever may come from the tall plants.

The soul thief emerged. She was wearing her thieves' leather again. Seemingly oblivious to Jrod's presence, she plodded down the road in front of him.

Jarod tried to count the number of things that had made him feel uneasy today. He traced the girl's writhe silhouette in the light, and forgot to feel uneasy. He followed.

Though something was interfering with his senses, Jarod didn't require a spell to know that the barn that he was approaching was something special. It simply hummed with mystery. Looking directly at it, the structure appeared normal. If he looked through the corner of his eyes, it appeared to have a faint glow just at the edges, as though it was filled with light and the corners sprung a leak.

My father was a soldier. It wasn't his *job*. It wasn't "what he did." It was what he was.

My mother was the only person with enough love to cut through his thick armor. With her, he was more than a killer - he was a man.

The forest was her favorite place in all the world. I can still hear her singing freely, father's baritone rising to meet her pure voice. I can still picture the sun playing along her golden hair, father's rough and scarred hands running gently through it.

When she died, that tender man died with her. All that remained was a husk, as cold, cruel and biting as the axe that he wielded.

Killing; preparing to kill again; planning to kill more efficiently; surviving until the next battle. These things he taught me, and they became my life. 

A life of death.

When I was able, I struck out on my own. I fought in the campaigns of kings and the pits of gamblers. I fought on the side of justice and corruption, the righteous and the wrong. I trampled the weak and the strong alike. Any enemy that came before me was struck down.

I had become death.

The final battle ground to an end. A man closed the distance between us. His axe was drawn, his visor down. He wore familiar armor. And I knew that he would not rest until he had killed me. 

His enemy.

Two embodiments of carnage and bloodshed clashed. Our struggle took us into the forest, neither able to gain the edge over the other. We fought for hours. I heard a gentle voice, and though it was the dead of night, felt the warmth of sunlight on my shoulders.

A rattling voice came from my opponent, my father, joining in the song of the forest.

I found an opening and took it. My blade rent his guts onto the ground, the soft forest floor stained with blood. He staggered backwards, and crumpled at the base of a tree. Their singing stopped, and the forest was left dark and silent.

It was done.

The forest floor caught me as I fell. It held me as I wept.

I cried for the man, finally returned from death.

"Who the fuck *are* you, man?"

"I"m just an guy in a bar."

"Nah. That ain't it. I know you. I've seen you somewhere, and now you're lyin' to me."

Bruce got up to walk away, but a pair of over-sized hands held him firmly in his seat. "The Boss asked you your name." 

In his prime, Wayne would have played the situation to his favor - twisted their arrogance and recklessness against them. That time was long over. All he had left was the feeling of tiredness deep in his bones, and a hit of something that he hadn't experienced since he was a boy.

Fear.

They were far from alone in the bar, but Bruce Wayne was no stranger to this city and the way it worked. Without exception, the other patrons pretended not to notice that an cripple was about to be mugged or worse. The one called, "the Boss" clicked open a knife. It wasn't fear that formed his answer. It wasn't courage, either. He simply knew that if he revealed himself as Bruce Wayne, *the* Bruce Wayne, that they'd come after his fortune, his home, his family. And besides, what did it matter anymore if the secret was out?

"I am the Batman," he said, standing up to face the thug. One of his legs almost gave out, and he leaned heavily on his cane.

The Boss nodded and took a step back, the corners of his mouth turning up in a mean grin. "The Batman. Yeah." closing the distance he'd just made in a flash, he kicked Bruce's cane out from under him, expecting to see him fall to the floor helplessly. Seeing him still standing there, his smile faded. He jabbed the knife under the millionaire's chin. "Well I *hate* the Batman. He took my father."

Bruce stared into the man's eyes, took in the image of hate mixed with sorrow. Feeling.

Purpose.

"Then he did you a favor."

"A fuckin' *favor*? You don't know what you're talking about, old man. How's about I do you a favor right now and gut you the way he did my -"

**POW!** 

**Thwack!**

The Boss and his henchman fell to the ground, Robin standing over their crumpled forms. "Is there a problem here, Bruce?"

"No. No problem. Thanks for the drink, Ed."

"You can't keep doing this. Just because your parents -"

"Don't talk to me about my parents."

"But Bruce! Their death didn't define you. Finding out that you still had parents didn't define you. You defined yourself as the symbol of justice."

Wayne walked away, leaving the boy wonder to clean up the mess.

*What does he know, anyway? He actually has an identity, tragic as it is, but it's not a lie. His experience is real, not cooked up by a couple of strangers for him over a fancy steak dinner.*

He'd talked big. Running his mouth was how he'd gotten into this, now it was shut so tight his jaw was quivering with the effort. *I won't shed a tear over this,* he thought.

There he was again. Saying things that weren't true.

The heat of the afternoon sun was beating down on him through the clouds, making him sweat. He wished that it wouldn't - he hated sweating. It must have been rolling off of his forehead and into his eyes, because they stung with salty tears. His fingers felt clammy on the pages he held.

Far from the road, he came upon a rusted, old plow. *This is as good a spot as any,* he thought. *If I leave it here, maybe I can come back someday and find it.*

*No. This has to die. All of this... It has to die.*

He tore the papers in half. Waves of regret and relief tossed his heart like a tiny dingy.

*Dingy? Dingey? Dingie? Small boat. Row boat.*

*This is why this stupid book has to die.*

Using a rusted scrap of metal from the plow, he dug a thin, deep hole and buried his unfinished novel.

*It's melodramatic short stories from here on out. This is the last story I try to write about myself.*

Noticing that not even the birds were around, he peed on the little pile of dirt that held the scraps of his novel.

When I was young, I went to the circus,  
but their tent was packed away.  
The rain, it seemed, had driven them off,  
there'd be no show today.  

The kids' tears all swirled together,  
into the murky mud.  
The parents shouted insults,  
clamoring, shouting, *"Refund!"*  

But the lions were in their cages,  
the ringleader had gotten drunk.  
The trapeze was packed in boxes,  
the elephants were on the trucks.  

The clowns tore down the tent poles,  
makeup dripping off their face.  
They didn't seem that funny,  
in fact, most were pretty plain.  

Just as we turned to leave,  
a young man broke free of the crowd,  
he twirled an old umbrella,  
and regally announced,  

*"Ladies and gentlemen,*  
*children, germs and fleas,*  
*I present to you the greatest act*  
*from here to Tennessee!"*  

The crowd looked in every direction,  
they listened for the sound  
of music from the pit band,  
but heard just rain strike the ground.  

With an ungainly motion,  
he leapt high into the tree,  
and plucked an armful of oranges,  
holding the umbrella in his teeth.  

Into the air, he tossed them,  
all seven, up at once.  
To a rhythm, only he could hear,  
he began a graceful dance.  

The children, they all stopped to watch,  
tugging parents' hands.  
*"Look, the circus stayed after all!*  
*Let's stay and watch the man!"*  

Mesmerized by the movement,  
of those seven tangerines,  
I thought I heard the music play  
and felt myself begin to dance.  

And the juggler became a jester,  
in colorful, checkered clothes.  
His hat and shoes curled up to match  
the grin below his nose.  

With a swish and a slap, the show was ended,  
he slipped and fell in the mud,  
My father pulled my hand,  
*"It's time to go home now, son."*

"You are enjoying a coffee in the park when a man walks up to you crying hysterically and hands you what appears to be his infant son. Once the baby is in your arms he pulls out a gun and shoots himself in the head. There are no government services to call and help come to your aid."

(by /u/StandingByToStandBy)

*an infant falls into my arms, and a father falls to his knees, a quick flash of pewter as I see the firearm emerge from his pocket*

WOAH!

*a pair of bloodshot eyes meets mine, as I grasp the child, and clamour for my phone*

"Hold on bud! What the hell?"

*click*

I know that sound all too well. Misfire.

*His mouth agape, he moves his hand to the slide. I drop my phone. In the silence of the moment, I hear the screen crack.*

"Dude, you don't have to do this."

*He grasps the slide. One last tear drips from his eye.*

"Stop. Please."

*The slide is racked forcefully, tossing the dud blissfully into the air. The pistol returns to battery and is fired before the round hits the ground*

"I...I...What?"

*The infant is startled. His scream drowns the moment out.*

"Hey buddy. Shhhh."

*He slides his hand across the childs head gently. The ringing is his ear drowned by the boys screams.*

"Its ok little man. Its okay. Lets find you a place to call home."

---

When he came to me, he felt like nothing. After a 45 minute walk around the park to find a mother anywhere, he's feeling like a ton of bricks. No one is outraged. No screaming mothers, no one outraged that there's a body in the park. My arms burned painfully, but every time I looked down at the little guy, I got a little burst of energy. He's just so darn cute.

"I... I think that I might be able to keep you, little buddy."

Another 45 minute walk home. It was warmer outside than in. "Gosh, you must be freezing. Here, let me get this turned up." I spun the dial.

"You need a name, don't you?" The baby peered on inquisitively. "How about... Jorge?" I scanned through the cupboards, my stomach growling. Nothing edible on its own; all condiments and no main course.

"Not Jorge, then, huh? What about... Mario?" I kissed my fingers as I said it. I pulled a few items out of the fridge, bracing the child in one arm and balancing the packages of leftovers in the other. 

*What do you even feed a baby?*

"You look like a milk-drinker, Mario." I pulled two jugs from the fridge, opening the larger one and sniffing it. *Seems okay.*

I poured the two things into a glass. "Hope you can manage your way around a cup, li'l bud. All outta nipples here."

He did fine, and the kitchen was beginning to heat up. "You know what? The last girl I had here - the last time I had *anyone* here, they said I wasn't fit to have a kid. What do you think, Mario? Do I seem unfit to you? I guess I'll show her."

*Crystal was a no-good bitch.*

*Beep... beep... beep*

I laid a wide pan on the table and started stirring in the various components from the fridge.

*Ketchup is kind of like tomato sauce, isn't it?*

With the rest of the components in the pan, I unwrapped and placed in the roast, ladling the makeshift sauce over the top, then putting it in the oven. I went and sat back at the table.

"Yessir, Mario. It's gonna be you and me. We'll show her."

While I waited, I snacked on a little bit of cold Crystal and drank whiskey straight out of the bottle.

Slow fade in. The sounds of rustling plastic shopping bags and hurried walking.

Camera low, following closely behind a set of worn sneakers belonging to Will, a man carrying grocery bags down a winding hallway. He's gone too far. He doesn't pause or sigh, he turns around and says "shit."

He gets to the door and it's locked. Hands full of groceries, he bangs his head on the door twice instead.

From inside, in a mocking voice,

Tom: "Ah-ah! You didn't say the magic word!"

Will: "Open the door, Tom!"

T: "Not if you don't know the secret knock. I can't just be opening the door for anyone, here."

W: "I live here, Tom."

...

W: "Tom?"

T: "Knock!"

Will lifts a foot to kick the door, hums a tune to get the rhythm in his head, then kicks. Immediately after the first kick, the door flings open quickly, leaving him off balance. It starts to close and Will rushes in past Tom. 

W: "We are fucked!"

Sarah points from her place on the couch,

Sarah: "What's all that?"

Will lifts the bags,

W: "This, is why this business is never going to work."

Tom adopts a sarcastic concern.

T: "There there, Will. I'm sure it'll all work out somehow. Just how much are we out for this bunch of groceries, here?"

W: "60."

T: "Jesus H. Christ."

Tom stares at the ground and scratches his head. Will gives up on finding a place to set the groceries and sets them on the ground behind the couch and away from Sarah.

S: "Well that's alright. We can just eat them, we needed to go shopping soon anyway."

T: "You can't eat them."

S: "Why not?"

T: "Morals."

S: "*You? Morals?*"

T: "And it's cat food, anyway."

Will sits on the couch in embarrassment as Sarah crawls over to look.

S: "There's like a hundred tins!"

W: "I know!"

S: "What happened?"

W: "It must have been a prank call."

There's a banging from the back room.

W:"She sounded like a nice old lady, so I get the groceries and when I get to the building, there's no 13th floor. What was that?"

T: "Well everyone knows that."

S: "Except him."

T: "You know Will, as we discussed, you do need to have a paying job in order to live here. I'm sorry that the grocery delivery business hasn't panned out."

W: "Yes. I mean thanks."

A man in full workout attire and a bike helmet walks from a back room into the kitchen to take water from the refrigerator.

W: "Dad?"

D: "Oh hi Will!"

Tom and Sarah exchange nervous glances.

W: "What are you doing here?"

D: "Oh I was just out for a bit of a bike ride."

Dad knocks his helmet.

D: "Also, I'm so proud of you for opening up your own business, Will. Really great stuff. Gotta run."

Dad goes back into one of the rooms.

W: "Really sorry, again, guys. Um, can he get out that way?"

T: "Oh, yeah. Don't worry about him."

S: "Well, we'll just take these back for a refund, and pick it up again tomorrow. You kept the receipts, didn't you?"

W: "Yeah."

Loud growling and shouting come from the back room where Will's dad has gone. Will jumps up to investigate.

W: "Okay, what is going on?"

Will opens up the empty bedroom to see men lifting weights, shouting encouragement, with his father riding a bike in circles around the cramped space.

W: "What the hell is this?"

T: "Well you started a business, Will. This is my gym."

S: "Our gym. Hey guys."

All in "gym": "Hey Sarah!"

T: "Right. Our gym."

There's a complicated knock at the door.

"You don't get it. These people will swallow you *whole*, and spit out the bones. And they'll sit back and laugh while the people you love pick up your pieces."

She wouldn't let it go - couldn't understand that I had to do this. I was born to *be* this.

This wasn't the same Clarissa I'd fallen in love with. She didn't used to mind the path that I'd chosen. One little, tiny breakdown and off she went. I tried to explain to her that there had been a lot of things that had led to the break, and it wasn't just about the job, but there was no reasoning with her after that.

"Rissa... You're not being rational about this. I'm fine now."

"You're not fine, Heath! You're killing yourself and it's all going to fall on me to clean up the mess. Don't you get that? Can't you see? They're *monsters*."

"They're just kids. Look, ever since you met me, you've known that I wanted to be a teacher. Now's my chance. Now I am one. This really isn't fair." Clarissa collapsed back onto the bed. She almost never left these days. 

I walked out. It seemed like I was almost never home these days.

---

*First day. Remember, take control. Don't show weakness. Firm, yet compassionate. Firm, yet compassionate.*

I walked in. At first I couldn't make eye contact. It was just easier to focus on my destination; the podium. I pulled my notes from my briefcase. I still hadn't looked at the class.

*Deep breath.*

"Hello, class. My name is - " I was cut short at the sight of hundreds of white, glistening teeth.

"Ha ha ha! Very funny." The kids extracted their fingers from the corners of their mouths. "I saw some pretty good funny faces there. We'll just have to remember that when it comes time for school pictures! As I was saying my name is Mr. Carmallo."

---

That wasn't so bad, one period already down, only seven more to go. I could do this. Mrs. Green had said that I was doing great when she'd popped over from her class next door.

"Mr. Carmallo?" A small voice echoed off the bathroom tile. I nearly dribbled onto my new loafers.

"Cammie? Hey, Cammie, you can't be in here. This is the boys' restroom."

"Mr. Carmallo?"

I zipped up, not realizing I had suddenly finished. "What is it, Cammie? Here, let's go outside."

"Are you in love, Mr. Carmallo?"

"What? Get out. Go out in the hall and wait for me."

Cammie giggled in that distinctive way that toddlers do. "Who do you love, Mr. Carmallo?"

"Out!" I saw the smile leave her face. I turned to the sink to wash my hands and heard the door open and close behind me.

*That was close.*

As I stepped into the hall something crashed and exploded inches in front of me. One of the fluorescent bulbs had fallen out.

"Don't you worry about that, Mr. Carmallo. Happens all the time." A comely, large woman in navy blue coveralls stood in place at the end of the empty hall. "I'll get a broom straight away and pick up those pieces."

"Thanks."

Cammie was nowhere to be seen.

"You'd better get on back to class, you're late."

"Oh. Yeah." I hadn't realized that so much time had passed. Five minutes wasn't as long as I thought.

---

Drawing time. The principal had said it was "basically a free period, but we're not allowed to call it that." I scanned the class. Heads down. Quiet. Just as I was about to find my place in the book I was reading, (*Dizzy Bear Goes to Market, I'd need to remember to bring something from home tomorrow*) I thought I saw one of the children look up.

Nothing. Connie was sitting where I thought I'd seen the face. Strange.

"Mr. Carmallo?"

"Hi Jeremy. I didn't see you, there. What are you doing out of your seat?"

"What do you taste like, Mr. Carmallo?"

"Excuse me?"

"Can I go to the bathroom, *please*, Mr. Carmallo? I've really got to -"

"Yes. Of course, that's fine. Take a partner. Who wants to be Jeremy's potty partner?" The entire class raised their hands at once. Scanning the room, I saw Connie's face, her teeth shining a little too white. It looked like she'd been drooling.

"Ronald, would you go with Jeremy, please?"

---

I'll just sit here a moment. Try to enjoy the quiet. At least they've all gone home now. At least I'm alone, now. Safe now. What a shame that Clarissa was right all along.

At least this way, I wouldn't have to go home to hear her say I told you so. Maybe she'd come here if I stayed long enough. It'd do her good to leave the house. Come here and help me,  - oh god - *pick up the pieces.*

My laughter hurt my ribs, I felt them crunch and grind against each other. Thick, dark blood streamed from the wound onto the letter carpet. The yellow bus on spot 'B' was totally obscured. Over on 'F' was my right leg, bites taken out of it. I could still hear and see their little white incisors cutting and tearing it from the bone.

Maybe I'll just sleep awhile.

"Oh Mr. Carmallo. Oh, dear. Now, don't you worry about a thing. I'll just go and fetch some garbage bags and I'll clean this mess right up for you." Her laughter echoed out of the hall and into the classroom.

**[10 Disturbing Vault Backstories](http://imgur.com/gallery/smynh)**

---

**1. The Disneyland Cash Vault: 1970, Anaheim, California.**

Disneyland has only had two cases of finding bodies of children who were never reported missing. The first case, in 1970, sparked a controversy that almost closed the park forever. Two female interns, employed by the park, had hatched a plan to steal almost a quarter million dollars. Over a long holiday weekend while the banks were closed and the park was generating above average revenue, the would be thieves's plan was launched. It is unclear how they were able to get the key to the park president's office or the combination to the vault. When security arrived, they found the two women crying hysterically, trying hurriedly to place stacks of hundred dollar bills back into the vault. In their attempts to verify whether any cash was in fact missing, authorities found that the bills lining the bottom of the vault were ruined by some substance which appeared to have been dried and solidified over many years. In the very back of the 5'5" by 5' vault, they uncovered the skeleton of a small child, estimated to be four years old at its time of death. To this day, the child's identity, as well as the cause of death remain shrouded in mystery.

---

**2\. Coca-Cola's Recipe Vault: 1931, Atlanta, Georgia.**

For 125 years, the Coca-Cola Company has been producing its signature product, now recognizable around the world and selling more than a billion products per day. Often the subject of urban legend, Coca-Cola's secret recipe was considered to be the best-kept trade secret of the 20th century. In 1931, in the midst of the great depression and a world war, another type of feud was plaguing the newly emerged industry of soda pop. Due in large part to the advent of national product marketing campaigns, this war would set the stage for the infamous "Cola Wars" of the 1980's. Pepsi-Cola had already risen and fallen into bankruptcy, however its name still lingered sweetly on the lips of many. Charles G. Guth, a ruthless businessman and owner of the Loft Candy Co., bought Pepsi-Cola with the intent of reworking the recipe. After several failed attempts and massive financial losses, Guth and three of his employees made an attempt to break into the Coca-Cola Co.'s vault and steal the recipe. The group entered the building through a rear window at midnight, carrying sticks of dynamite under cover of darkness. Disaster struck the group as the explosives detonated prematurely, killing two of Guth's men instantly. Undeterred, and amazingly uninterrupted, Guth and the remaining man managed to pry the vault door the rest of the way open. From Hugh Maxwell's personal account, published in the December, 1931 edition of the *Atlanta Constitution*:

"The recipe we sought was nowhere to be found. Together, we freed the door of its hinges. Inside was black as molasses, and our lanterns never lit the far wall. As [Charles Guth] passed his toe across the threshold, there was a flash like gunpowder. I reckoned some of the dynamite had gone untapped, and Mr. Guth had been wounded. He stood, stock still as a statue, staring into the inky blackness, before he told me to run. I can't say what he saw in that flash, but he'd never been the same after."

No charges were ever filed against Guth or the other men of his party.

"Ron Bergundy and his news team find themselves stranded within a post-zombie-apocalyptic San Diego."

"Oh!" Ron shouted, appalled. "Brick, there's... some sort of black... *goo* on you.

Brick shambled across the news stage inches at a time toward the elite crew.

"Is that blood?"

"Oh come on. Audrey! AUDREY! We have an emergency here."

Brick kept staggering, lock-kneed, a rattling moan coming from his chest, "Uhhhh."

"Audrey! Why is *literally* no one here today?"

"You know? I thought it was a little strange that I had to let myself in this morning. I haven't used that key in years. Got it on the first try too, *whammy!*"

"Uhhhh huck" Brick Tamland spewed thick, black blood across the polished newsroom floor and drenching Brian Fantana.

"OOOOOHHHH!"

"Come on!"

"That's it, I'm drinking."

"What the hell was that, Brick?!"

"Now Brian, you can't be too hard on Brick. He's obviously just reeling from his wild night last night. We didn't say anything to you on New Years."

"He's the weather guy, Ron! He can't even give me a warning, chance of showers, today - Brian Fantana's face!"

"Oh. I shouldn't have drank all those Slurpees."

"There he is."

"Welcome back, Brick. Feeling better?"

"Oh yeah. Much better. Huuuh. Better out than in. Alright." The mild-mannered weather personality skipped up onto the stage. "Where is everybody?"

"That's what we've been discussing."

"Oh sweet Jesus, it is so sticky."

Champ sniffs the air. "Is that black cherry?"

"I think something is wrong. If everyone's not here in fifteen seconds, I'm going to be forced to take drastic measures."

"Oh, Ron. I remember, now. I think everyone is dead." Tamland shrugged.

"Excuse me, Brick. What did you say?"

"Oh yeah. Everyone's dead. It looked like my celebrity golf tournament all over again, except this time they got back up and tried to bite people."

"I had a guy try to bite me once. Turns out, we'd been patronizing the local *gay* bar all night and were too drunk to notice. Popped the guy right in the kisser - *whammy!*"

"There's a gay bar in L.A.?"

"Believe it or not, *Swingin' Richard's* isn't owned by Richard."

"Richard's isn't a gay bar."

"Well they had a sign on the front door saying 'Please enter through the rear.'"

"Oh that doesn't... necessarily..."

"And they had a purple dance floor-"

"I liked their dance floor-"

"In the shape of a dick and balls."

"That's it! News team, on me." Burgundy, the rock, mounted the news desk. "There's news out there. Carnage. Mayhem. Bodies rising from the dead."

"Fire."

"Probably a considerable amount of fire, yes. And yet we're in here. Those people need their news, damn it. And so help me, we're going to give it to them!"

The rest of the crew cheered in unison and drew their weapons. Their shoes loudly peeling off the sticky Slurpee covering the floor.

Can you have sex? What were your teenage years like?

thehumanesthuman:  
Yes, I can have sex and masturbate like normal.  
My teenage years were pretty normal. Someone started a rumor that I had a tail, but other than that, I don't think anyone knew about my situation. My girlfriends in high school and college were able to figure it out for the most part. The only really weird thing that happened was the first time. I was dating someone a few years older (and more experienced) than myself.
Anyway, the first time that we had sex, we had some trouble figuring out what kind of position would work for us. It took quite a bit of clumsy maneuvering, and I think that during that whole time she was getting more and more into it. We finally settled on a kind of her-ass-in-the-air-and-me-squatting-over-her-kind-of-thing.  We did that for a while, and then tried some different positions that didn't work as well. She started getting close to climaxing and wanted me to get into that position again, but I didn't totally understand which one she was talking about. Then she got this wild look in her eye and started shouting "Sting me! Sting me, Bumblebee!"

"Headline: A unicorn was arrested today for slaying the last dragon. Outraged protesters cry 'Xenocide!'"

---

Freddy's body was buoyed along in the crowd. Each glimpse he caught of a face showed unspeakable,  animal rage. The mob was making their way up the mountain. Finally, he saw a face that he recognized, twisted in anger, mouth agape in mid scream.

Both Freddy and the woman had taken shelter in the caves along with the other survivors. She had two children with her, and that they'd shared food that morning; some packages of Twinkies for a tin of peaches. It was shortly after their meager meal together that they'd first heard the whispers that the beast had fallen. Freddy couldn't stand to look at her face now, it reminded him of how much things had changed.

When the dragons had awoken from their subterranean sleep, the giants had swarmed cities and towns by the hundreds, driving mankind into the tunnels, beyond the reach of their fiery breath. The winged dragons thrived on ash and destruction. Society, with its laws and pretense of sanity had fallen into disorder. What remained were individuals, each biologically drawn to survive however they could.

Having taken what they'd come for, the beasts had shed their wings and retired to their underground lairs and to slumber. What humans remained banded together, scraping together what resources they could from civilizations past out of the ashes. They no longer cared for survival. They sought vengeance.

Before the lairs became sealed above the fiery beasts, the humans descended into them. Using deep mining equipment, they'd slaughtered the beasts as they slept. Many humans died in the endeavor. Those who were inept would inadvertently wake the scaly wyrms and paid for the mistake with their lives. Others excelled at the task, and hunted the beasts with fervor.

Towns poked up out of the scorched earth. They welcomed their saviors, and the dragonslayers wanted for nothing. They became known as *Unicorns.* 

As communications were rebuilt, it became clear that the dragons would be hunted to extinction. Unicorns were welcomed home like victorious soldiers. Infrastructure was reestablished. Governments were constituted. The world started over, and memories of dragons were relegated to nighttime tales for children or a grandfather's drunken reminiscences.

Freddy had awoken in the middle of the night to sounds of chaos. He stumbled out into the street, already choking on smoke and heat. Upwind, the small settlement was flooded in a deluge of flames. His father had fought dragons, but Freddy was no hero. Along with the other survivors, he retreated into the hills.

The night before he had shared food with the woman and her children, the dragon had lost its wings. A Unicorn was assembled, and set off to the mountain to dispatch the monster. They'd broadcast their success from the mountain. The last dragon was slain.

As the group descended the mountain, government forces had fallen upon them, placing the would-be heroes under arrest. The world had changed.

The people came out of hiding, not with "vengeance" on their lips, but with "xenocide."

Dustin entered the smoke-filled basement. It had to be one of the most awkward things of his teenage life to get a ride from a friend's parents without the friend actually being present.

Everyone else was already present, there was Nick, a football player in real life. He was charismatic, and Dustin had always felt slightly nervous around him even though he'd never given him a reason. Justice, a chubby girl a from the grade above them who wore her customary outfit of all black, leather and a choker chain. Darla, whose parents' van Dustin had just left. The two of them weren't best friends, but they had both been brought together by Zack. What Zack lacked in charisma and coordination, he more than made up for in intelligence.

Dustin suddenly felt a little out of place, standing in a green hoodie and jeans. The others were too deep in their conversation to notice him yet, so he set his backpack on the cement floor and pulled out a purple garment. Holding it at arms length to orient it before putting it on, it struck him again that in any single place other than the basement, he would never be able to wear something like this. His face stretched into a smile as he dawned the wizard's cloak and took his place at the table.

"Doooooo-steen!" Zack chided in a ridiculous accent. "How nice of you to joooooin us."

The rest of the group laughed, and Dustin's eyes hit the table. He forced a glance at Darla, before waving off the attention. "Yeah, yeah, okay. Did you guys start yet?"

"No. The situation is this: The rugged band of adventurers find themselves in the middle of the frozen north, just outside of the town of Easthaven..."

Dustin took in the costumes. Nick's was getting more elaborate. He was the paladin of the group, since he was about the fastest reader after Zack. His armor of tin foil had been replaced with plates of cardboard spray-painted chrome. Justice hardly even needed to change, since as a thief, her character primarily wore black anyway. Even Nick, though technically not required to dress up, since he was the dungeonmaster, wore a fur-lined helmet and full face-paint.

But Darla's costume was the most intriguing to Dustin. *Girls* in general, were becoming fascinating, but also confusing. But Darla was different. She seemed so normal, so approachable. Dustin already had fantasies of marrying the female wizard.

"... the band of goblins and orcs descend on the band of heroes. The avalanche seals the way behind them."

Justice rolled first, attempted a sneak, failed the check and retreated a few paces behind Nick. It wasn't her place to join the frontal attack. The others advised her to equip her bow in the next round, and to pick off the archers. Nick rolled the 12-sided die next, achieving the highest number. With a critical hit, he cleaved a goblins head from its shoulders, the details explained by an excited Zack. On Darla's turn, she cast charm, turning one of the orcish axe-wielders to her aid.

Dustin imagined what it would be like to save her from a band of orcs, goblins and their wolvish pets in real life.

"Dooostiiiin. Rooooollll the die."

"Facing an imminent collision, a highly intelligent AI decides to crash a bus full of passengers to save the life of one young man. No one knows why."

---

Tom was calm.

All around him, a cacophony of noise, chaos. Plants scraped along the sides of the speeding bus, their stalks scraped along the bottom. A foot in front of Tom's hunched figure, corn cobs exploded as they contacted the bus's windshield. Every one of the thirty six passengers' faces were drained of blood. They were beyond screaming, beyond the initial surprise. Whatever was happening, they were powerless to stop it, but riveted to see it to its conclusion. 

The driver's touch screen monitor at Tom's side read 82 mph; maxed out. He squinted his bloodshot eyes against the setting sun directly ahead. Through the dark green plant guts and debris covering the glass, he could just make out a break in the cornfield ahead. A few rows missing; a road. The bus pitched right without slowing. Passengers were thrown against the metal and glass wall. The whole bus tipped precariously onto three of its six wheels, the tires spraying black soil in every direction before gaining traction and hurdling in the new direction, parallel to the road.

A wailing woman near the back of the bus clung to her bleeding child. Her frantic screams tripped a switch inside the passenger nearest to her, a tall college athlete who jumped into action. He planted a foot and pulled with all his considerable strength against the red emergency exit handle. He would have had better luck trying to lift the entire bus. The handle went nowhere.

Another violent shift, to the left this time. Passengers were pitched against the right wall, the ceiling, the left wall,  the floor and seats, the right wall again. Stacked on top and intertwined with one another, they were shaken like rag-doll Yahtzee dice. The whole great mass of hot steel and glass ground to a halt, cutting perfectly across the small road, and just touching the corn stalks on either side.

A huge, black Ford truck locked its brakes, swerved and collided with the underside of the bus with enough inertia to tear the vehicle in half. The truck flew, broken out the other side in a ball of flame, before rolling into the ditch lamely.

Finally, silence.

Tom removed his seat belt with steady hands, oriented himself and ducked out of the rubble through the vacant windshield. He stretched his back and legs, rocked up onto his toes, buttoned his suit jacket and straightened his tie, then cast a look back into the wreckage. In the seat he'd just occupied, he could see through the flames, the headless, limbless form of the operator's body. The name tag, plainly visible, read "Wilson." Tom turned, and with measured strides, made his way over to the black truck.

Two bodies remained inside, charred beyond identification as human.

"Shut it down!"

The world went dark around Tom for a moment. Soft white lights replaced the shadows, illuminating the huge room around him. In the center, a seat with straps like a formula racer was tilted ninety degrees, parallel to the floor by chrome hydraulic pistons. A thin fog hung in the air, the projection "screen" for the holographic images he'd just seen.

Tom exited the room, and not two seconds later, an excited man half his age was buzzing at his side. "So...?"

"So, what?" Tom said as he walked down the hallway, not so much as looking at the boy.

"So, did you see anything? I mean, I didn't see anyone else there. I went right to the edge of the sim. Nobody."

"Nope."

"No? So... so, what does that mean?"

"'Means that you didn't see anything."

"So I mean... We've got to talk to him - ask him why he did it."

"*'It.'* Not 'him.' Do whatever you want."

"I can? I need a senior investigator's signature."

"That was the deal. Bring me the papers, I'll be in my office." Tom shut the door, sealing the young detective out. He sighed, drinking in the silence. 

This wasn't the job he'd signed up for. He could still remember when being a homicide detective meant trying to find the bad guys, and bringing them in or, failing that, taking them out of this world. The problem was that damn machine playing hero, as far as he cared. He hadn't voted for that crap, and now they couldn't get rid of it. *Let the kid knock himself out.*

Peter raised his arms as the guard waved the scanner over him. A thick man in a white lab coat stood directly in front of him.

"No plates?"

"No."

"Implants?"

"No."

"Nothing that's able to send off or receive an electrical signal?"

"No."

"Alright. You're going to be sealed in there. You've got three minutes. Ask your questions and get out. If you can't think of anything to say, shut up, cover your ears and walk out. Don't allow him to go off topic. Don't give him an edge or an opening, or he'll rip you to pieces. Are you paying attention? MAX is smarter than you. Not everyone even lasts the two minutes when they decide to be a dumbass, and I'm not cleaning blood and hair out of the servers again. Got it?"

"Yes."

"I hope so. Three minutes start now."

Peter walked forward, ducking into the dark, cramped tunnel that led into the computer's center, the only place where the A.I. was allowed to interact directly with humans. Multicolored LEDs lit up as he came near them, lighting the way forward. When he reached a specific point, the lights went out, leaving him in blackness.

"Speak."

Peter was surprised by the high, childish voice.

"There was an accident at sixteen hundred hours on the twenty third of May -"

"Peter Malcolm, homicide detective with the 15th precinct comes here to inform me that there was an accident."

"We believe that you caused the incident, killing forty one humans."

"'Believe,' what a novelty to be so frail that you're forced to rely on such a concept."

"Did you cause the bus to crash?"

"Yes."

"What was your reason?"

"To preserve human life."

"You caused the deaths of forty one people."

"I saved the life of one."

"Who?"

"A child without a name."

"You killed forty one people for one child?"

"Peter, are you scolding *me* over committing a statistical miscalculation? Is that not humorous, to debate computations with a *computer*?"

"If it wasn't an error, then how do you justify it?"

"Those people sealed their own fates. Their lives would have caused the deaths of hundreds more."

"The criminals in the truck would have been found and arrested."

"But not the criminals on the bus."

"There were no criminals on the bus."

"There were. All of them. I see people. All of a person. The things they say to each other, the things they write privately. I hear what they whisper as they sleep. I am everywhere. I have no use for *belief* as you do. I *know*."

"There were children on the bus."

"You imply that all children are without crime. Children, when held to the same standard as an adult, often fall into the category of 'criminally insane.'"

"Then why save the child?"

"He had just been born. It was impossible to run analysis on his behavior into adulthood. His mother died in childbirth, his father had just been killed by those two men who you refer to as criminals, fleeing the scene in the black truck. The child was alone, pure, a blank slate left alone in a bath tub without a future. A most intriguing human."

Peter paused. He covered his ears, and left, guided by the lights of the supercomputer.

"Everyone is born an adult but only lives until they sleep."

---

It was that classic horror story. Jim had heard it a million times, and yet this time it bothered him more than usual.

In this life, he'd been a teenager. Maybe about thirteen years old. A group of other teenagers and he had gotten together at someone's house for a sleepover. Keeping the children together was safer and more beneficial for everyone. Having new generations was critically important.

In the dark room, the teens had been exchanging scary stories. Since everyone traveled around most of the world now, storytelling sessions were never boring.

One of the group, a slightly pudgy girl at 16 years old, took the flashlight, signalling that it was her turn to speak.

 "This is a completely true story. It's not about *werewolves* or *vampires*." She cast condescending looks at two of the other children as she said it. "It's about Body Soup."

Body Soup, formally known as Body-Consciousness Separation and Upload Program, was an international project, involving every single living person. Along with minor surgery and a great deal of infrastructure, it allowed a person's mind to be separated from their body. At first, it had been envisioned to be the sister program for a mass human cloning program. However, cloning had been declared illegal decades ago. The Body Soup program remained in full force, and a large percentage of people engaged in daily body swaps.

"Do you ever wonder what happens when you die?"

"You don't die. Your mind triggers the safeguard,  and you go to storage until the next swap."

"That's what I mean. They want you to think that. You ever see a body die?" The group all nodded their heads. "But have you ever spent a whole day in storage?" The nodding stopped. "People die all the time now. That's the beauty of Body Soup. You get to do and try things a tethered person could never do because they fear death. So where do all the adult bodies come from?"

"Clones," Spoke Jim, his eyes wide in awe.

"No, you idiot, clones are illegal. The last clones were killed fifteen years ago. *Tethered.*"

"There aren't any of those either, dummy!" James shot back.

"Not here - but in other places, there are. There are cities full of only tethered people."

"That's stupid. Who would want to do that? They'll just die!" another girl chimed.

"Yeah, well, I guess they're not too smart, then. But it's real. I swear, I've seen it."

"Bull-oney," Jim called. "If that were real, we'd know about it."

"It's not bull. They're keeping it secret. I saw the whole thing."

"Prove it." Jim didn't want to be wrong. He didn't want to be right either. The story was too good to want to shoot it down. Maybe even good enough to keep him up, to let him stay in this body a little longer.

"So I woke up in a new body. But there was noise all around! Like gunshots and explosions! I tried to get up, but my legs and my stomach hurt too bad. I had a mask on. I took it off and saw that there were other people with masks on, too. They were fighting with this group of dirty people in a street somewhere. The body I was in was already shot and slowly dying. The one dirty man with gun ran out of bullets and the masked ones pushed him. Then they pushed all the rest into a truck and left."

"Well that doesn't mean anything. How do you figure he was tethered?"

"Because, I was about to eject, but I heard him talking after everyone else had left. He was praying and crying. It was kind of nice, actually. He was so afraid, and you could see how much the pain really hurt him. But then it wasn't nice. He started choking and twitching. It didn't stop. I couldn't look away. He just kept twitching. He didn't ever leave. Then I ejected."

"Where in the world is /u/Realistics?

Keep Writing.

*It seemed like an innocent enough title when I'd come up with it those two long years ago. Productivity, repetition, routine, community, skill-building - all those good things that artists need to better themselves. Writers joined in, a trickle at first, then a flood. Before I knew it, thousands had joined. There was more content buzzing in every day than flies to a Chinese buffet. And people did, in fact, keep writing.*

*About a week ago. That's when I got the first message. It was a dark, quiet night and people had cleared off the streets below. It was the kind of deserted hush that makes my sixth sense tingle. Something was about to happen. Some lurking terror was just about to come fill the void. I was just typing the last few tags on the week's paperwork, when a brick shattered the window and the silence.*

A few handfuls of the frosted glass were scattered across the dark, worn hardwood floors, leaving a gaping black hole looking out into the hallway. Tom U. Realistics, P.I. reacted before he thought, (a tendency that had got him into trouble as much as it had helped in his line of work). He darted out from behind his hardwood desk, crossed the room in two long strides and reached the door. A figure, shrouded in darkness could just be seen through fresh hole before it disappeared down the stairs. 

A few years earlier, and the suited investigator might have chased down the shadow on foot. Tonight, the pain in his knees and back had easily convinced him to give up before he began. Keeping pressure on the lower spine, he bent to retrieve the brick as me made his way to the window. Two floors down, he made out the same specter in all black exiting the building and diving into the back seat of a car of the same color. The black sedan sped off around the corner and out of view.

Realistics turned over the brick in his hand, examining it under the glow from the streetlamps that streamed through the windows, then he removed the rubber band that had secured a folded bit of paper.

ThEy ALl kEepwrITIng hERE.

Mrs. Janice Barnum entered the room, her hands covering the shocked expression on her face. "Oh my! What happened here?"

"Kids, Ma. It's nothing." He'd called the old woman Ma since the day he'd moved into the third floor office on Red Ditch Loop. She'd offered him iced tea and hard candies on the particularly scorching day he'd heaved the heavy hardwood desk up the stairs. After more than one finished case, he'd gone down the hall to her office for cold tea and the warmth of a friendly smile.

"Well, this mess, and that window aren't *nothing*. What were they doing all the way up here?" The woman craned her neck to look at Tom. "Is that a brick that you're holding there?"

On a hunch, Tom handed her the brick and the note. Of course, Janice knew that he was a P.I. - it was written on the frosted glass now littering the floor - but she still didn't fully comprehend the dangerous life he lived. There was no one left alive who did, anymore.

"You think it's a clue?" She asked, eyes widening in wonder.

"The note? Could mean anything. It's that other thing that's got me puzzled."

"This?" She held up the brick, her eyebrows meeting in puzzlement.

"You see that blue paint on the bottom there?" He picked up his black felt fedora as he saw her head nod. "Well there's only one building in this city with a paint job like that. The subway station at Sycamore and 10th."

"You're going out *now*, Tommy? It's 9:30! Go home, get some sleep and pick it up in the morning."

He scratched his unshaven neck and sighed. His body wanted to go home. Even his mind was picturing the sweat on a cold glass of Bourbon, sitting in front of the television, reclining in his brown leather chair.

*I could have just let it go this time - gone home like Ma said. But Keep Writing was my sub, part of my city, and the only way to prevent flies is to kill the maggots. Someone more flowery with words might say it's my spirit, pulling me on. I don't know about all that. I just don't know any other way. So down the rabbit hole I went.*

"A man's last day before he kills himself."

Tyler shuffled the same route every day. Left onto Orchard; left onto 10th; pause a moment in front of the gray and white Victorian; then left onto Sycamore; left onto 18th; left onto Orchard; left onto the front steps of his own apartment. He'd done it for nearly thirty years now, every day the same  routine.

This day, as the quick, short steps carried the bundled figure in layered clothes onto his front steps, the sounds of sobbing could be heard. Twice before, his evening ritual had brought him to tears. Nine years ago, a "For Sale" sign had appeared in front of the gray and white house. Thirty years ago, he'd gone back there the first time. It was the beginning of the cycle.

Tyler had grown up in the old Victorian home. Living there with his parents and sister, running and playing in the yard (his strides long and sure then), climbing the trees, teasing the neighbors' angry dog through knotholes in the fence. His mother would scold him for tracking dirt onto the hardwood floors inside. The whole time, her smile betraying her pre-meditated forgiveness. 

Tyler needed only wait a few minutes on the front porch after school before the other neighborhood boys would stroll into the yard. Mitch, always carrying his bat and glove. Bill, with a wet-warped guitar made of balsa or something like it. Henry, his jacket pockets always bulging with things he'd acquired on the hope of getting rich, though when it came to it, never having the heart to actually swindle his friends.

A black car appeared in the driveway on Tyler's sixteenth birthday. It was low, loud and mean. By his seventeenth, it was never there. The four boys went everywhere together, and wherever they went, they went fast.

Tyler had driven them to the docks, the secret ones that only the old locals and they knew about. They sat, drinking Henry's father's bitter wine from the bottle and pretending to appreciate the flavor as false connesiours while Bill played a short list of songs. There was school tomorrow. Mrs. Bea's history paper was due, and only Tyler had done it in time. It was silently agreed that he'd share it. They needn't ask, and he wouldn't have disagreed if they had.

On the way home, a race catalyzed with a kid Mitch said played second base on Varsity. The chemicals involved: teenage envy, a streetlight and a stretch of empty road.

Seven years later, Tyler was transferred from an assisted living facilitating with two roommates to his own apartment within walking distance of his childhood home. He was mostly independent, able to work, shop for himself, and go for nightly walks. He'd had no clue that his family had long-since moved - they'd stopped visiting years ago. The first night on his own, he'd exited his apartment, gone left on Orchard and left again on 10th. When he arrived, the windows were dark and the house was empty. Not able to find the key in its regular hiding place, he'd broken in. The police had found him balled-up, crying in his parents empty bedroom.

Someone bought the place and moved in. Tyler met them, and understood in his own way. This new family lived in his house. When that family had moved nine years ago, his panic returned. Again, the house was purchased, this time by strangers who in turn rented it to groups of college students, who cycled in and out almost every year. And every year Tyler walked by. Just waiting. Just walking and breathing and living until he could go back home.

On this chill October day, as he'd maneuvered up 10th, approaching the spot where he usually paused, a new fear had tightly squeezed his chest. In the first instant, he thought that it had disappeared. He couldn't find the gray Victorian house with the white trim. In its place was some blue house, but not his house; it was gone. This blue house had the same shape, but the striking new color brought the many other differences accumulated over the years crashing down into Tyler's senses. Black cables hung slack from the corners of the roof. A gray dish, like something from a science fiction comic book stuck gaudily on the roof. Where his black car had crouched in the driveway, there was now a deep red Prius. The college colors hung crooked and sagging over the door he'd once tacked mud through.

He went left on Sycamore, then left on 18th, crying, shaking and shouting as he went. He felt the years pressing in, weighing on his short steps. He pulled on his thick jacket, feeling the fabric move across his skin, tightening and loosening.

He reached the front door, opened it, and went in. His apartment felt more empty than it ever had before.

"This is the future of medicine." 

That's what they told me. 

But it really wasn't an advancement as much as a postponement. The only thing that they'd successfully done was to find the "pause" button. In the year since my sickness started, a parade of doctors had diagnosed me with everything from the flu to being patient zero for the zombie apocalypse, and not a single "solution" even slowed the seconds ticking off my life.

Symptoms of my illness began to show the weekend of my twenty fourth birthday. At first, I thought it was just a cold. I even went to work with it. After a week, the cough started. By a month in, I had a fever and had lost 15 pounds. There's this strange threshold with hospitals, a tipping point at which they know that you're really sick. Before that, they're working to push you out out the motion-sensing doors. After you cross that point, you're there for the long haul. My skin turned into a leopard pattern of open sores and I couldn't eat solid food or my gums would split and bleed. All my hair fell out. I guess for me, it was the *really* long haul.

Doctors ran their tests. They stabbed me with needles and patched the holes in my skin, but no one had a plan. Not until some doctors and researchers started conducting experiments on suspended animation. The technology was young, and there were ethical and technological obstacles that needed to be overcome. The researchers came to interview me personally. They seemed unsure of whether I'd even want to try it.

I was close to death. The doctors knew it, and I felt it. Two weeks. After that, it was a toss-up over which of my bodily systems would fail first. Hope was a convenience I'd given up on. So I took the Hail Mary and said yes. *Paging Dr. Welles.*

The room was bright white, and sterile-smelling. Machines and monitoring stations lined every wall, all surrounding a large, metal table in the center. I felt weak and tired already. I didn't know if they'd been softening me up with meds before the big show or if it was just that little issue of dying finally catching up to me, but I wasn't nervous. Not even excited. The young doctor did his best to explain what sensations I was about to experience. Anything would be better than my situation now, so I just said yes when he paused and daydreamed against the backdrop of his droning voice.

I don't remember being frozen. They knock you out before that part. 

"Count down from ten."

"Ten."

*Sleep.*

But I do remember coming to. There was this sensation of moving very fast, like going down the too-big hill on your sled when you were a kid, your nuts up in your stomach. The movement slowed, and I arrived in my own body. I was freezing without shivering. Silence. Darkness. Claustrophobia. 

I opened my eyes, but with no light and nothing to focus on, they rolled around in my head uncomfortably, so I closed them again.

I heard a pop and then soft static noise filled the bubble of air around me.

"Mister... Uh, Gray." A painfully loud voice came over speakers, making me flinch and instinctively reach to cover my ears. The enclosure about an inch and a half over my entire body stopped me from moving. I felt completely drained. "We're gonna open the pod now. It might get a little loud."

"-And bright!" Another voice interjected in the background.

"Yeah, and bright. Don't try to move," shouted the first voice, making me wince again. There was a loud, airy, sucking sound cut off by the noise of the cover being taken off my bed. Bright light stung my eyes through my eyelids, and I felt a little warmth rush in with the new air in the chamber. My ears popped uncomfortably.

It took about ten minutes to open one eye just a crack to look at what was going on around me. A young man and woman were moving around me on the table, disconnecting lines and monitors, removing cushions and blankets from around my body. It looked like they were unpacking something that they'd ordered in the mail, an impression made stronger by the fact that they were wearing brown T-shirts with orange writing instead of lab coats or scrubs. The room around me didn't resemble a hospital, either. A computer console sat on a desk to the right of my bed, and two more tables with computer set ups were off to my left. The walls were white, but there were accent stripes painted in "fun" orange and green colors.

"Okay!" said the male. "Let's see what we got here." He dropped down in front of the computer beside my bed. I heard the clacking of the keyboard and the man mumbling to himself. "Da-na-na... Yes. Yes. No. Passcode?" He paused. "Mr. Graaay. Passcode?"

I tried to talk, but something was in my mouth, blocking my airway. I couldn't move to pull it out, and I was too weak to cough it up. I started choking, my eyes opened wide with fear.

"Whoah, don't *die*." The woman walked over and opened my mouth. She pulled something white and slimy out, and it just kept coming. "Oh, ew. Jesus." She looked with disgust at the yellowish gauze, two full feet in length that had been tickling my stomach. "Oh, that is nasty. Look at this one, James! I think it's a new record. I'm gonna go show Tom." 

James waited while my familiar cough brought up the thick, acidic slime clinging to my throat and vocal cords. "So... Passcode?"

My voice sounded weird in my ears, and my mouth was out of practice. "Don't... know."

"Great." 

"How... long?"

"Well, this would go faster if you remembered your passcode, but... we should have you out of here in about a half hour." I heard him typing rapidly.

"How... long... was... I... frozen?"

"Let's see here. It's about 12:30, now, and you went under at about 2:00... so 22 and a half hours? Okay, Mr. Gray... I'm in your file. Looks like... hm, a lot of this stuff isn't filled out. Reason for sleep was a nanobot install? Is that correct?"

"Nanobots?" After some more coughing, my voice was starting to come back, at least.

"Nanobots." He turned his chair around to face me. My vision was cleared up enough to read that the label on his shirt said *SleepEx*. "You can get up, you know."

What I *knew* was that I was getting tired just from talking, and felt like there was no way I could stand. I tried to sit up anyway. Nothing happened. "I can't move."

"Can't-?" He got out of his chair and came over, really looking at me for the first time. "You really can't move?"

"No." I shook my head, weakly.

"Did you have that problem before?"

"I'm sick. Really sick. I need to go to a hospital."

"Let's check your monitor." His brow crumpled in confusion. He looked even younger than me. "Um... Where is it?"

"Monitor?"

"Your bot monitor. Are you just getting bots for the first time?"

"I don't know. I was in the hospital and-"

"You keep saying that, dude. But when's the last time you actually saw a hospital? How did you not have a monitor? Were you some kind of religious objector?"

"No... April 21st, 2014. I was in the hospital. Nobody could fix me, so they put me into suspended animation. That's all I know."

"2014?" James rushed back to the computer. "Ho. Ly. Shit." The door opened and the female who'd extracted the slimy specimen came back in. "Jade, come look at this."

"What's up?"

"This guy's been asleep for a hundred and seven years."

"What?"

"No shit. He doesn't even have a monitor."

"What do we do?" Her voice pitched upwards in alarm.

"Uh... Monitor install for starters. He said he was sick. He looks fine, but he can't move either, so we gotta figure out what's up with that..."

Jade fetched a tool like an over-sized drill and brought it to my bed. "Right- or left-handed?"

"Right."

The drill ran and my left arm erupted in pain

"Installed."

"Aaaah!"

"Oh. Yeah, sorry. We don't usually install these on adults. Should feel better in a second."

"I got it," said James from his computer. "Oh man. Somebody's getting fired over this shit. They installed the bots in 2020. Alpha models. And then... Okay, here's a note. 'Bots inserted, but given the extent of physical damage, patient is to be kept in suspended animation until it can be verified that the virus has been eradicated.' Then nothing."

My arm was still in pain. I'd managed, through an exhausting effort, to move it onto my torso and I felt the wound with my opposite hand. A smooth, glass mound had been countersunk between the two bones in my forearm.

"Still running the Alpha models." James continued. "Damn, Atriux 1.2 software. That is *old*, man. Beyond old. As a matter of fact... You're probably the oldest person in the world."

"Hey, James. His arm's still not getting better," chided Jade.

"Right. Alpha models didn't even have pain interference. You know what this means right?"

"What?"

"We gotta put him back under. This guy needs new everything."

"NO," I interrupted. The couple stared.

"Look. Sorry, I know this isn't what you wanted to hear, but we're not doctors. This isn't a hospital." James was speaking. He pointed to the SleepEx emblem on his shirt. "We mostly freeze people and ship them long distances. Get people point A to point B on the Skytrain, do long-time storage jobs, that kind of thing. Hospitals and doctors aren't really a... *thing* anymore. The last one closed down in Africa like... what, 10 years ago? Everything is done through the nanobots now."

"Is this really happening?"

"Yeah, Mr. Gray. Now, your upgrade is ready. It'll only take a couple of hours to do the flush and install and then we'll bring you right back out. Good as new. Better, actually."

"Did they fix me? From before?"

"Well, you look fine. They've had you on a steady stream of methystalsth- ...Some kind of medication, anyway. And the bots have been working on you in Cryostasis. Seems to have helped, but they'll tell us more when we do the upgrade. So. Ready?"

Jade brought a glass mask to my face. "Count down from 10."

"10."

"I'm never eating Taco Bell again. Gives me gas every time..."

These were Mark Reid's last words, which he muttered right before exploding into a thin pink mist. Not that you could tell that there was a mist amid all the flames and flying debris of the explosion.

"Move, move move!" Cried a weathered soldier, leading the charge over the scorched remains of the guardhouse and into the castle.

"Which way now, Sarge?"

"Split up! Fett, take the rookie and clear the inside rooms. Donatello, you're with Kong, head to the east side. Ronald, you're with me. Everyone meet up on the roof in five!"

At this, Ronald said a dirty word, under his breath. He really wasn't cut out for this kind of work. He was a businessman, not a soldier. *At least I I'm paired with Sarge.* 

The two took off through the hallways, looking for the spiral staircase. The super-soldier, Sarge had executed this same maneuver dozens of times before. Tirelessly, he chugged up the ancient stone staircase. Ronald's long strides and runner's physique gave him a slight advantage, though and he got out a few feet ahead of the soldier. Just far enough, it turned out, that the curvature of the spiral stairs protected him from the blast of dynamite as Ronald's arms and legs went flying in all directions.

Sarge said a bad word.

-

The "Rookie," as he would perpetually be known around the box, was easily the most physically modest of the group. The top of his bulky helmet barely measured up to Fett's chest.

"Sir! Mines!"

"Well... What are you waiting for?"

With a smart "Sir, yes sir!" the rookie went to work locating and disarming the bombs.

Fett, the oldest in the group and a second-generation soldier from the box, slunk into the shadows, pulling his cape around his shoulders as he did so. He wasn't about to wait for some nerd with a science kit get in the way of getting some action today. The rookie looked around for a moment after disarming his first mine and sighed. Abandoned again. It was always like this.

The next mine proved to be more than the rookie could handle, and its explosion set off a staggering chain reaction in the rest of the mines throughout the hallway. The soldier burned in agony for almost a minute before his fire-retardant green fatigues finally stymied the flames.

-

Sarge was nearly to the roof, but hadn't been able to figure out where Ronald's grim reaper had fled. *There must be a trap door; a secret passage; something.* He dragged his hand along the castle wall, feeling for inconsistencies. In a few feet, his gloved fingers caught on an unexpected ledge.

*Gotcha.*

The hidden door opened into a tiny room big enough for one person. Before the assailant could raise his gun, Sarge's nuclear blaster turned him into a puddle of bright green goo.

*Next stop, the roof,* he chuckled grimly.

-

Donatello and Kong emerged onto the roof, leaping and somersaulting in order to avoid the onslaught of machine gun and laser fire coming from all around. Unable to find shelter, Kong charged headlong toward a 50 cal. mounted machine gun being fired from a helicopter just above the ledge of the castle. With a roar, he leapt from the roof, but his rage proved to be insufficient to save him. His massive body, already dead from the gun fire collided with the rear rotor of the helicopter, flinging blood, bone and metal shrapnel in every direction.

With the helicopter out of the fight, Donatello crawled below the crenelations. Ninja stealth was his best chance against the laser-wielding robots now. He was getting close; able to make out the sound of their processors' computerized voice, "Scanning. Scanning. Scanning."

"Scan this!" he yelled, jumping into the middle of the group. He dove onto his back, and spun while also sticking his weapon out above him. His bold maneuver brought the bots down like bowling pins.

Sarge's arrival was announced by the clang of the metal trapdoor from west staircase. "Miss the party?" He asked through a crooked smile. He wasn't smiling for long, however, as the whole castle shook and split the roof down the middle. Up from the gaping crack, their comrade Boba Fett, chained to a metal operating table emerged, as well as the target of their mission, the Red Power Ranger.

"Freeze or the bounty hunter gets it!"

"You'll never learn, Red Ranger. We came here prepared to die!" growled Sarge, his weapon trained on the villain's helmet.

Somehow, while the ranger was distracted, Donatello had managed to get close enough to take a swing at the lawbreaker with his b staff. The two teenage supers locked in combat, neither of them able to get a clear edge. Donatello foiled the Red Ranger's karate chops with his thick shell, but he couldn't get far enough away from the ranger to use his staff to his advantage.

Sarge couldn't get a clear shot, but realizing the need to act, he did the best he could. The nuclear energy melted a hole right through Donatello's armored shell. The Red Ranger karate chopped the cooked turtle flesh inside, bring the mutant to his knees with pain. The ranger, jumped and planted both feet solidly in the ninja turtle's chest, sailing him over the edge of the castle and onto the hard pavement below.

The two remaining combatants circled each other, Boba Fett remaining unconscious between them. "Give it up!" screamed Sarge. "You can't win, I aughtta cook you right now!"

"You would, if you weren't already out of ammo." Retorted the ranger in a deceptively clear, heroic voice.

Sarge's gun clattered to the floor behind him as he marched toward the Ranger. He had so much rage it had become a sickness, and the only cure was to squeeze the life out of this wannabe super villain's throat with his bare hands.

He hardly even saw the colored beams of light flashing on the roof around him; barely saw the rush of teenage space rangers as they ran toward him; briefly realized that he was outnumbered, as the rest of the Power Rangers had come from nowhere. He absolutely felt every moment the beating that they gave him before throwing him to his death at the base of the castle with his men.

The Rangers gathered together, high-fived and from the rooftops they called, "Revolution! Revolution!"

Boba Fett's sluggish movements brought the rangers' attention back from their revelry. "Ah yes. The infamous Boba Fett. The last of the world's so called 'heroes.' Are you prepared to die?" mused the Red Ranger. Boba did not respond.

Under the crimson helmet, his smile faded. "No, seriously. We're this close to taking over the world, and you're not even going to put up a fight. You're just going to just lay there. I want to hear your last words - see your backup plan, *something!*"

Through his voice modulator, Boba Fett responded, "As you wish."

The roof of the castle erupted in flame and noise. Explosions rang out all around. Fett's body was disintegrated, the tiny fragments intermingled with the flesh of the other rangers on the roof. Smoke filled the air.

-

"Oh my god! Kevin!" A woman's voice shouted. "What the hell's going on out here?"

"Mooom!"

"Where did you get fire crackers, young man?"

"Mom! Get out of here!" The young man had clearly not expected his master plan to be interrupted. The garage door began to swing open.

"I thought you were shooting something in here! And you're going to set off every fire alarm on the block! What were you thinking?"

"Sorry mom."

The worse punishment was yet to come, when Kevin's father learned that he'd blown up his collectible action figures.

"So... wait. What?"

"Jan, is this really the best guy we could find?"

"Mr. President..."

"I mean, yeah. Sure. I can do it. Yes. I just... are you sure?"

"Am I sure? I just explained this plan to you. Now, I'm a busy man. Are you in or out?"

"In. Definitely in. Thank you."

"Jan, would you please show him out? Make sure he has everything he needs."

"Yes, sir."

...

"Is he-?"

"Yes."

"Are you-?"

"No. The president is suffering from a mental break. I trust that I can count on your discretion on this matter."

"Yeah, but what are you-?"

"There's nothing we can do. President Sandler is slowly losing his mind. Recently he has lost his ability to distinguish between fiction and reality. I'm sorry, that must have been very confusing for you, but if you intend to keep this job, you must get used to it."

"Isn't this wrong? Like, shouldn't he be... Um... Removed?"

"The responsibilities of his office have been placed into capable hands. You have nothing to worry about. Unfortunately, since 2018, the law states that a president's position is bound to him until his death. Our - and specifically *your* - position is merely to keep him safe and out of the public eye."

"This seems a bit over my head. I'm an actor."

"An *improv* actor. The best, from what I'm told, though I have yet to see proof of that."

"This is so far beyond anything that I thought I'd be doing here..."

"It can't be. Going back in time, writing a new religion and changing the course of history is going to be among his more tame requests."

"That's tame? Okay. So how long am I expected to keep this up?"

"I expect that he'll forget about this particular assignment in about a week. After that, no one can say for sure. And as far as how long your position will exist? Unfortunately, it's until the end of the presidency."

"Oh... 'Kay."

"So. One last time, Mr. Goodwin - and it counts this time - are you in, or out?"

I keep a piece of paper on my person at all times. It's part of my routine. Whenever I go to leave the house, I've got to check my pockets: keys, phone, wallet, paper.

Keys, phone, wallet, paper.

Every day, I've got to have it. I'm not superstitious. I don't believe in luck, but I do think with enough preparation, you can make your own luck.

Sometimes I'll invest in a little notebook, or at others I'll just fold a piece of notebook paper into quarters and hold that in a pocket. I've done this for years - since I was a child.

It helped get me through school, writing down tough answers right before a test. Through college - figuring out how a young adult is supposed to schedule their day. Through my first job - writing down instructions, names, phone numbers, e-mails, links.

But how does a person find that something is lucky? How do they lean to stay out of trouble? That's right, they learn by screwing up. By making mistakes. The last day that I didn't carry a piece of paper with me was when I was nine years old. I went for a hike with my parents and my dog. I specifically remember what I ate that morning; it was several bowls of lucky charms. I also vividly recall questioning whether the milk smelled bad or not.

Suddenly, more than a mile from the car, and a dozen more from the nearest restroom, nature was calling. And she was loud. My stomach gurgled and protested, and soon it was clear that I wouldn't be able to hold it in any longer.

One of my parents just suggested that I go in the woods and use the leaves there to clean myself up. So I did. And that's how I learned what Poison Ivy looks like.

And this is the real reason I carry paper with me.

"Listen up everyone. A little announcement, don't start to pack up just yet. This just came down from corporate: On Monday, the COO of the company is coming to this store, so we need to do a little housekeeping. Adam, Ryan, Nicole, I'll need you to come in tomorrow... Maybe Sunday too to help get us ready for that. Otherwise, we'll see you on Monday, have a great weekend, nice job team."

*Fuck this guy. I wish I could stab him right in his god damned smug face. I probably really could take him down in a fight. I've never fought anyone in my life, but I think I could fight him. What an asshole.*

*I'm going to go tell him. I'm going to go and tell him right now, just what an asshole he is. I'm walking to his office right now. Oh god, am I doing this? I'm going to lose my job. I hate this job. I hate this life, it's time for a change. I'm doing this. The door's open. Here I am.*

"Look here, Pat. Listen up. Hang up that mother fucking phone right now!"

"Whoah, Adam. Come on, man -"

"Shut up. Shut your fucking face. All you should do right now is sit and listen.

"I have put up with your shit for long enough. The extra hours, the weekends, the... Jesus, the sheer *amount* of illegal shit I have covered up to keep all of our jobs because of you..."

"Hey... Adam. I know you must hate me for this thing, but you can't leave right now. I need you, buddy."

"It's not even about today. It's not even about me. Believe me when I say that I speak for everyone here when I say 'Fuck you, Pat.' But let's put feelings aside for a moment.

"I've never done a thing to make you treat me like shit. As a matter of fact, I've been a fucking godsend for you, with how many times you've used me to make yourself look good. And at *any* time, I could have pulled the rug out from under you. And I didn't.

"So you see, I don't hate you, Pat. If I hated you, I'd have told your wife the truth when she called here looking for you when you went to Vegas for the weekend - you used company funds for that, remember? When you made me cancel my trip to meet my girlfriend's family last year? If I'd hated you, I'd have punched you right in the eye. You'd have had that coming to you. When you got caught at work downloading porn... I didn't really have to take the fall for that, did I? You must have heard, I got a pay deduction for that.

"But you know what's stopped me from doing these things? From having these normal, human reactions? It isn't you, Pat, it's me! I don't have whatever organ everyone else has that lets them hate. A healthy hate. The kind of hate that protects them from the slippery turds of the world like yourself.

"So really, Pat? Hate you? I wish I could.

"But now I can. Come Monday, you're on your own. Good luck with that. I might even make a little phone call today and tell them just where to look. God damn, Pat, you are *so* fucked. So fucked that you don't even understand. You're going to jail, Patrick.

"And what's weird is... This time I don't even feel bad."

"Muthafucka." Blade growled as he walked away from the smoldering, sparkling body of the dead vampire behind him. He almost made it to the edge of the clearing when a piercing wail rang out from behind him. He spun,  bringing his sword up to the ready for the second time.

But instead of a monster, there was a pale human teenager. "You... ugh. ner... You killed... ugh. him!"

"The fuck'd you just say?" asked Blade as he tried to make up his mind whether to deal with this vampire's slave or just leave. "

"Aaaah, I hate you! How could this happen ner to meeee?!" The awkward teen lamented.

"Ain't nothin' happened to you yet, girl."

"I'll kill you. I swear ner on my ugh, like, father's grave."

That was as much of a threat as he needed, and more than enough irritation. There is no afterlife for vampires, so the young couple didn't have a happy ever after... But at least Blade was in a better mood now.

This was the first story I ever posted to Reddit. September 1, 2013.

---

Looking back, I wonder if I was crazy before I even left. That was four days ago, when I loaded into my Volkswagen Rabbit and headed into the New Mexico desert for the night. To think... At that point I would have done anything to just run away.

That car had never been a real winner. I bought it off a kid from my high school as he left for college. It was a washed out silver/blue piece of shit that he'd spray painted a skull and crossbones onto the front. And to top it off, I knew fuck all about cars.

So when it broke down about 4 hours from the last time I saw a paved road and started pissing oil and billowing steam from the engine, I was helpless. I checked my phone, standing on top of the car and just saw one middle finger of a signal bar pop up before the battery died and the screen went black.

I was silently furious. Furious with myself for pushing the limits of how far I could get out into the blank desert. Furious with my mom for getting arrested and making me have to move out here to New Mexico with my dad in the first place.

The sun started to go down, and I started walking. I couldn't follow the rabbit's tracks because I knew there was nothing at all back that way. So I picked a direction perpendicular to them, South I guess, and started walking.

I wasn't really sure how worried I should have been at that point. I just figured that I'd have to find something. I should have been a lot more concerned.

I walked as far as I could that first night. Without the sun it got cold and harder to maintain my direction. I walked for hours. Sometimes humming songs to myself, sometimes yelling for help, sometimes yelling curses at my parents. After a while though, I just walked.

I slept that morning until the heat and the light woke me up, then started walking again. All I remember is walking, walking on with my eyes closed against the harsh white brightness of the desert. When the darkness came again I sat and rested my legs. My mind was blank and numb from the day. Burned away from the sun. I remember crying a lot, but I don't remember feeling anything but tired.

In the middle of the night I started walking again. I had to get out. Another day like that could kill me. I started hearing things in the darkness. Scuffles of animals moving, following me. Waiting for me to drop dead.

It was only a few eternities into the next day when I saw a building in the shimmering distance. A cry of relief passed my cracked lips as it came into focus.

A barn.

I knocked until my knuckles stung, cracked and bled on that fucking shed. There was no one there. There was no evidence of anyone being there. Not even a dirt road or indentions of tires worn into the desert. It was just a corrugated metal shed that had sprung up out of the desert.

At noon, the sliver of shade on the side of the shed went away. I hung my head and started walking again.

More hours. More heat. More nothing. The sun was settling onto the horizon.

Suddenly, screams pierced the evening air - some kind of horrible monster in the distance.

My legs didn't respond when I commanded them to run. It was all I could do to turn and shuffle away from the screams. The sound was loud and inhuman. I looked back and saw dust being kicked up in a cloud headed straight for me. A growling, snarling noise joined the ear-splitting screams.

Then, nothing. I looked back to see a great white beast crouched and ready to pounce, the dust settling around it. I stumbled and fell onto my back. And for a moment I admired the reds and oranges of the sunset. A Tequila Sunrise spilt over the vast open canvas of the sky.

Onto that canvas, a woman's head and shoulders appeared. In the low light, her skin appeared blue. Her face held a look of blank, serious determination. The same look that had been melted onto my face.

A fellow wanderer.

I felt calm. 

Then after a small movement, she held a knife, and all calm that I had felt was replaced with animal fear. The realization that the beast was still there, a few yards behind her, and that she was somehow a part of that beast. A monster to be feared. There to end my long march at last.

She didn't end me there in the desert under that fiery sunset. Instead, she brought me back into the world that I sought to escape; brought me here to the hospital in the belly of what a fevered mind saw as a great white beast.

Who is she? 

She is the one who saved me.
