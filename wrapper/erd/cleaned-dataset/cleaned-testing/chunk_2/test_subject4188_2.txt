 These are the albums that got me in to dance music, the mixed ones in particular were generally some of the best ever released especially the first 5-10 which were the pinnacle golden age but in latter years they went down hill a bit and went too commercial and the mixed era died along with the brand, it still lives on but only to make Ministry of Sound money, the craft and care of the originals were something special and touched your mind, body and soul, the highest state of euphoria

These are about the best euphoric ones they ever released...

 From the season 3 finale, next season could we see Ferguson finally be convicted of attempted murder and with the net closed around her, could we see her behind bars and to make an example of her, could she be put in Wentworth?

Would be great to see her dropped down a peg or two and see her roughed up a bit with Vinegar Tits the new governor or would we need another season to finally see this happen? 




 I wonder if Jim will grow a pot belly 




 I wonder if we may see Vicki Vale who Kim Basinger portrayed at some point, a recurring reporter character would play well especially if she was feisty and snooped around a lot  




 Check out these guys, they are UK based so would serve that area but seeing as the season has done, it no longer matters that there was a massive delay in broadcasting between countries...

 Well, we have had a lot of Fish and Cat and not a lot of Ivy, poor Pepper and then there's Leslie and Montoya then there's Barbara who has been a mess all season, what were the writers thinking and then there's Victor's mistresses, Penguin's mum and various fleeting characters like Robin's mother and that's about it

Outweigh this with multiple sausages and testosterone fuelled nonsense, can we have more totty in season 2 please?

I see the writers may be having more diverse characters in season 2 so hopefully there may be a few welcome surprises in the way of sultry butt wiggling beauties 




 Bad Photoshopping 




 No pics, this is a scam 




 Yeah and Jim as the guy from The OC 




 Also, will the kids grow in to their roles as it's important to consider actor changes as well and if that will alter the show, I think the casting has been spot on and if anyone changes Riddle Man or Pengy for another actor there will be hell to pay 




 So long as she stays away from fetish whips till she gets older 




 Yeah David deserves a shot when he gets older but consistency is the key here, not every season has to be great but so long as it keeps going and the characters remain entertaining then why not
