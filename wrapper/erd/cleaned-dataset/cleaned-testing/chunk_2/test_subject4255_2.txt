You know how it went on sale 2 days ago? Well this whole damn time I've owned the game I have just assumed I've had it. Until last night.

I play mulitplayer with some friends of mine and I try and join their game only to find out I don't actually have it and now it's $30 (a little ridiculous for a DLC if you ask me). If you have an extra copy from a bundle, i'd appreciate it.

I'll even draw something in mspaint for you if you comment (you don't have to give me the game for me to draw.) 




 One of you fine people posted a couple weeks ago about this site called usertesting.com.

I sign up and took a practice test (which paid out $10), got a 5 star rating and haven't really received a test since. I mean, you get screened for most of them (which, so far, has led me to 0 successes). 

Do you have any tips or tricks on getting new tests? I mean shit, I'd love the extra work but it is so damn picky. Should I just lie or something? I'd hate to do that. 




 Open to accounts older than 2 months.

To enter:

1. Comment with the game you'd like  
2. In mspaint, draw me your best interpretation of what the word "flargepool" is/means

 




 All I wanted was Crusader Kings 2 (can't beat the price, it's $24 on sale and humblebundle but $6.74 with the jumbo bundle)

* Deadlight
* The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing - Complete Pack
* Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition
* Terraria
* THE KING OF FIGHTERS XIII STEAM EDITION
* Legend of Grimrock
* Orcs Must Die! 2: Complete Pack

RULES:   
1. I will only gift games to people that **have not received**.   
2. Your account **MUST** be at least 2 months old and have at least 35 comment karma (none of these sit-and-wait accounts)  
3. **DO NOT PM ME.**   

**To Enter:**  

You must comment with the game you want (1 game per user), your steam ID, and your best mspaint drawn interpretation of what it means to be a "cattyflanger"

Winners will be picked in 24 hours.


Edit: Guys, I fucked up. I'll be passing out the games still but I won't make it in my 24 hr period. For this error if you read this, edit your post with another game and I'll give out 2 per winner.  




 Seriously, I roasted and ate 3 garlic heads last night and I haven't stopped farting since 8am CST.

EDIT: Clarification: Why do certain foods make me ***MORE*** gassy than others? 




 I see a lot of the baked dishes have it listed as an ingredient and I know it's expensive. Where can I get the best deal on it?

Thank you in advance!

If you have an extra copy from the recent sale (that I missed) I'd appreciate it! Thank you in advance!

 Cheat to win? I saw you, asshole ghosting in Bashnya. I just wish I had your fucking username to get you banned you cheating piece of shit. 









 I've tried the [Mae Ploy](http://www.freshnessgf.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mae-ploy-curry-paste.jpg) mix with no luck. Maybe I made it wrong? What is your recommendation for the best red curry recipe?

Much obliged.  














 I've just had this massive craving for it. Gotta have it!

 Hello all, I hope I'm in the right place.  

My yard has a bad chigger problem. If any of us or our animals go out, we get eaten alive. I've been researching non-pesticidal ways to remove them from our yard and have come up with two safe tactics.

1. Nematodes
2. Sulfur  

My problem is, I'd like to rid them while spending the least amount of cash.  

Nematodes work well, I hear, but they are pretty expensive and require a special hose hookup to apply.  

Sulfur is cheap but I'm curious if it will affect my yard's ecosystem in a harmful way. I know it smells (that's not an issue for me) but would that smell keep birds away? What about bees? I'd hate to shoo bees away because of the chiggers. Would it negatively affect my dog?  

Any help would be appreciated.

 Hello everyone! I have an office birthday celebration this friday and the cuisine is "anything salad." I want to bring a keto-heavy salad but am not sure what would go well together. 

Could you help me out? It doesn't have to be limited to your typical leaf salads, keto variants of pasta salads, chicken/tuna salads would work as well.

I appreciate your help in advance. Thanks for being part of an awesome subreddit. 









 Hey all! I have a high school summer research project and I'm trying to figure out the age demographics of certain subreddits. You all are my first! Please post your age (that's it, no personal information). 

I'll follow up with my research results in a couple of months!

Thanks in advance! :D

I was planning on buying it (strict budget), then I got hit with a financial blow yesterday. I'd really love a copy.  














 What story will you never forget? 
 




 I walked into a bathroom and heard this weird noise coming from the stall next to the one I was entering. It was kind of like a small popping noise.

Anyhow, I sit down to take the browns to the superb owl. I pinch a couple of loaves and realize that there is no toilet paper in my stall. Shit! 

I didn't want to walk out with my ass covered in dookie so I asked the man in the stall next to me if he could spare some squares. He shuffles real quick and hands me a wadded up tp bunch with warm liquid on it.

I smelt it (you would too) and it was totes jizz.


TL;DR. Wiped my ass with a jizz soaked TP square. 




 HMB!? WHAT IS IT!!! 




 It was posted a couple of days ago, maybe thursday/friday of last week. It had horn sounds at the end of the runescape theme song. I've googled, searched reddit, searched my youtube history with no luck.

Any help would be appreciated. It was hilarious.  




 This is the second time I've tried it and I keep getting sick. I read about the keto flu but this isn't it. My tonsils have swollen up so bad that my throat is now the size of a quarter. 

I'm getting frustrated and I just want to vent. Am I just not able to do it?

I'm at the doc's right now.

For fuck's sake. This is a perfect example of redditors getting themselves off over their perceived "superiority" over everyone.

 I'm about to end my contract with my current energy provider and am in need of tips to get the best deal. I know that a 12 month lock in is popular but I've found a month-to-month plan that is cheaper. I also know that means they don't lock in your rate. 

Are there any redditors that have had a month-to-month and does the rate change dramatically?

 At work we have [wall-mounted lock box](http://imgur.com/UEUElTj) where we store keys. It's always been open but yesterday I bumped up against it and closed it. Now it's locked shut and nobody knows the combination.

It's not your typical [multiple-dial lock](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Combination_discs.png), I've looked up youtube guides that tell people to look for markings under the turning dials and it doesn't have that. What I do see is [THIS](http://imgur.com/m3MtVjw). There is a flat surface on the cylinder below all three of the dials. I've tried lining them up facing me with no luck, I tried using the opposite number as well with no luck. I'm not even sure if that's the way I should be going in order to open it.

I need help opening this lock. Any help would be appreciated. 









 Sony vegas isn't cutting it and I was wondering if there is a legit free alternative audio editing software available. Kind of like how GIMP is an awesome and free alternative to PhotoShop.

 "BECAUSE IT'S COMMON C-C-COURTESY. 

Think about it, Morty. You're have school on Friday *buurp* so you can't go see the midnight premier of C-Captain America: The Whatever. So you're talking to your friends when one goes:

'Hey Morty!, I saw Captain America: The Winter Soilder last night, here is some pictures of it even though you haven't seen it yet because you're following your capitalist overlords' wishes by being a slave to education and you're a good boy because of social pressures.'

H-h-how would you feel, MORTY? Would you feel angry!? *Beeeeeelllcccchhh* Yeah, that's what I thought. Think about, it Morty."



I get it, it's a karma gravy-train. But some of us have to be up for work early in the morning, have early classes, or don't have cable and have to wait for the episodes to be available online. So here we are browsing and BAM, a spoiler appears. It doesn't feel to good. 









 Hello Gracious Community!

I've recently decided to acquire a road bike and I've got some helpful tips from users on where to find a great selection of used ones under $200 (120.53 pounds, 145.36 euro). Below is a list of links of bikes that I thought looked great. Do you mind giving your two cents on which one would be the best purchase or advice on what a good deal looks like?

Here are some specs as to my body type:

I'm 5ft 8in (172.72cm)  
I weigh 195lbs (88.4505kg)


Also, if you see one that's not worth the price listed, feel free to give me an amount and I'll ask the seller! 

I very much appreciate your assistance. Thank you for the support/help! 









 Hello community!

I have a low-end mountain bike. I bought it used for $25. The only big issue I have with it is the handlebar keeps coming loose! I've tried tightening the bolt and ended up stripping it. I have a new bolt and it's not working to well either. Do you have any recommendations on how to keep it secure? Maybe a trick? 

Also, where is the best place to find used sports bikes? Like the majority of the ones on the front page. I really like their design, the thinner wheels, and the two-placement handlebars. They also look like they're a little lighter than mine. But they're expensive new! 

Thank you so much for your help! 



















 I have quite a few mods I'm interested in using but once I install them (using KSP Mod Admin) and start the game, the loader will run until it hits the middle and then just stop. The game doesn't freeze as the quirky comments above the loading bar keep changing. I've tried Texture Compressor (even the aggressive version) with no luck.

I would love your advice.

Here are my specs:

AMD FX-6100 Six core CPU (3.30 GHz)  
8gb RAM  
64-bit Windows 7  
AMD Radeon 6870 GPU   




 I was informed by a user that I am not taking decent enough care for my clothes therefore they are wearing out sooner than expected. I have learned about drying racks and shoe trees but was wondering if the community here could give me other types of tips and tricks that could extend the life of my business clothes including (but not limited to): button-down shirts, dress pants, dress shoes, undershirts, etc. 

Any advice would help immensely.  




 I am having a hard time finding business shoes that last. I'll buy a pair and they'll be ruined in 5 months.

Here's an example of what I'm looking for:

Any help would be much appreciated.

EDIT: my budget being:

No more that $110 (less is always better!).

Thank you!  
































































 I know. "Blind people can't see reddit!"

I also know that there are braille computers.

Maybe they can get their friends to help?

 Best quality for the money. 

Out of the $5 section of the Wiki, which one is your favourite?

 I'm not even trying to joke. I call it "dragon-ass". My ass lights up like a Chinese New Year. 

How do you handle it? Any tips (besides ***not*** eating spicy food because I love that shit.)

 I will give a copy of this game to the person that makes the sexiest alteration to this aged salami (using paint is ok).

Upvote the post for awareness and winners will be chosen tomorrow at 8pm Central Standard Time.

Do not forget to provide your Steam ID. Please refrain from requesting if you have already received something from GoG. I know how disappointing it is to submit to countless offers and come up with  nothing, so I'd like to give only the underdogs a chance. 


EDIT FOR ALL:

User /u/lumenation has informed me of this info:

**If you have Sims 3 on steam and try to buy expansions from stores or from Origin, they will not pair with the Sims 3 on steam. Only expac's bought on steam will work with Sims 3.  

However you can use the steam Sims 3 key on origin and any expec's bought on steam with origin as well.
If you knew this or not I just thought I'd let you know so you can inform others. I had issues with this when I originally had Sims 3 on my steam.**

EDIT 2: Thank you for your entries, ladies and gentlemen. /u/Manlyarmpits is the winner! Congratulations!

 Who and what's the story? 









 I'm trying to lose weight. I know that because I am a 5'9"ft man that I need around 2500 calories a day. How do I count calories in a way to lose some weight? Do I count carbs, fat, etc. too? 









 And yes, it's the real deal. None of that fake shit people try to swindle you for. I cleaned the rock and soot covered chunk myself. 




 Jesus! Not only do the rest of us want a copy of it but I want to buy the sims 3 as well. Your massive jerk-off of LFD2 is bogging down the damn server so hurry the fuck up. 









 I went to the doctor recently to get some blood work done. They said that my TSH was running high and that my thryroid isn't producing enough of the hormone. She wants me to start taking levothyroxine. However, I'm scared. What if there is an underlying cause of this occurrence? My family does not have a history of thyroid issues and I had blood work done last year with no thyroid issues (that I know of). I'm scared that if I start taking the supplement that if it's another issue that hasn't been diagnosed and is treatable, that I will eventually become dependant on the medication and my thyroid will stop producing hormones all together. Am I making sense? What can I do? 




 Am I correct in saying that she was once a man? I know that's probably a dumb question. She just looks so much like a woman! Except with a dick. Anyhow, I saw this presentation on shemales and how men get turned on by them. But gay men aren't. It's weird how our brains work. Something called an erotic illusion. Here's the talk: http://youtu.be/p-A8GvUehq4?t=21m35s. 




 I used to hate Yishan, until the thought police seized me. They beat me day in and day out. They deprived me of food, water, and shelter. They made me watch hours upon hours of reality TV (Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, and The Real Housewives of Atlanta) while crushing my ball-sack with a pair of vice grips. They inserted 2-4lb pineapples in most of my orifices and then forced me to eat the fruit. This went on for months.

That is... until Yishan saved me. He came and stopped the torment and he promised me that I would one day come to love him. 

Today is that day, my brothers. He is lov...
