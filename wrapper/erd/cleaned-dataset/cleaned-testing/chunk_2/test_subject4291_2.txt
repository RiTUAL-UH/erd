 Ouch. Maybe you'll find some middle ground that works for both of you? 




 Oh dang. Good to know. Thanks for the replies, it's been very enlightening (since I was considering JET myself).  




 Is that amount of money a living wage in Japan? And I'm assuming you enjoy your job/stay in Japan? 




 Ouch, sorry to hear about that. 




 If/when you do take her out, does she liven up after a while? Perhaps it'll just take some time for her to adjust to being more social.  




 How'd she become an ex, if you don't mind my asking? 




 English as a Foreign Language, iirc 




 What's it like? Are you on JET? If so, would you say it's worth it?

 I was lost while trying to get to a late evening meeting in Melbourne (I was an exchange student). My phone's GPS didn't work abroad, and I didn't have the sense to print a map before leaving. I had no idea where I was or which direction to go in, so I ask a random person on the street for directions. He says I'm about five miles from where I need to be, and there aren't tram that could take me there. He offers me a ride, which despite being super weird, I accept. I would have been late otherwise. 

In his car we got a bit conversation going. I asked him what he does. He was the [mayor of Yarra City](http://www.yarracity.vic.gov.au/Your-Council/Councillors/cr-geoff-barbour-mayor/). I was dumbfounded. Awesome guy. He was up for re-election, so I made sure to tell my Aussie pals about this encounter (some of whom called bullshit).

tldr; lost in Melbourne City, got ride from random stranger who turned out to be the mayor. 




 Sheeple. 




 I owe it to him to never stop searching. But what if he didn't actually throw the ball? 




 I agree with this. There's too much government secrecy as is. That said, the issue of politicians blindly voting along party lines is still one that needs to be addressed, as well as the issue of politicians not understanding what they're voting for (my favorite example is [this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/08/florida-banned-computers_n_3561701.html)). 




 This way, uninformed politicians would be kept out of blindly voting along party lines. As an added bonus, you'd be able to see which politicians are roadkill (i.e. not reading anything, thereby not voting on anything).

The quiz would likely need to be created by professional lawpersons, and would need to be kept in strict secrecy for this to work. 
 




 Belgium here. If you see someone you don't usually see (i.e. someone not from work/school/etc) three times in a day, you must go drinking with them that evening. 




 That pun makes me so angry I might flip a bit.
