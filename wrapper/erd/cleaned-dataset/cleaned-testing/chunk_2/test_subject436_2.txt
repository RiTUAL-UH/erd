 It also helps that Catholicism is rather liberal compared to many other Protestant groups. What would be really surprising is if we see more Protestant churches saying similar things. 




 Why wait when you can do it yourself? http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/surprising-history-powdered-alcohol-180951278/?no-ist 




 Side question: what's the average age for an active Navy Seal? How long are they "under contract" for? I'd imagine that this kind of continuous training isn't very good for you even if you reach 30... 




 I don't smoke marijuana, but I think that prohibition-wise it has to be consistent. If you're going to ban marijuana then drugs that cause equal or higher impairment should be banned. Alcohol is a great example of this. You either ban both, or neither. 




 OP wants a lil cuppa tea afterward 




 It's actually on FOX. 




 First hottest: Olivia Wilde? 




 Southland was great. I loved how they showed how his personality changed over the seasons. Too bad it didn't get a large audience... 









 That was only six days ago? Felt like months.... 




 So, this may sound a little out there, but... you could bring more than one sheet per person to a hot tub...... 




 Shit, I can't do math late at night. I meant 2^x, which is exponential. 




 It's stupid because the number of people you have to study is the number of generations squared. You could study mtDNA and Y, but that is a very small subset. And let's not even get into the whole issue of migratory patterns and population mixing. Sure, you can make general statements about certain groups as a whole (eg. there has been recent studies on Jewish migration out from the Middle East), but to claim geographical pinpoint is absurd and downright misleading.

You can claim where a population as a whole have migrated over time **on average**, but it's another thing to claim something about one person. 




 I mean, they were the first "democracy" but let's be realistic. When you have brawls in the legislature in the 1990s you're setting the bar pretty low. 




 Because it's fucking delicious. 




 I'm as "pro-Ukraine" as most others, but you have to admit... when a building is surrounded, molotoving/torching the place is not a great way to gain sympathy. 




 I think it's likely they'll expand on the MW/BO theme of playing the bad guys for brief portions of the game. I wouldn't be surprised if half the game you play as PMC and half the game was US forces. 




 As an older guy who cannot play multiplayer because he'll get his ass kicked, I've always played for the SP campaigns. They're also a bargain if you wait until they're on sale. Ghosts had a really interesting plotline and gameplay, but the problem was that it was too short. 




 Some part of California is pretty much on fire during the summer. I'm surprised that the state hasn't been more proactive in fighting drought, given all the state money that goes towards fighting these things. 




 I tried out the newer Nokia phones at a Verizon store the other day. As a quick comparison to the other flagships, I would say that in terms of what I most use a phone for (messaging), the keyboards blow away the stock keyboard on the Moto X and is as good if not better than that on the S4/S5. Some people really like the stock Android keyboard but I find it rather difficult to use (I also like the Blackberry Z10 keyboard, so YMMV). The WP interface is nice and fluid, but feels rather barren. Text is way too big for what I need and information is very "not dense". 




 Ghosts actually had a pretty fun SP campaign -- quite a lot of varied gameplay and was setting up a new universe -- but it was too short compared to the other CoD games. I think I finished it in one or two casual sittings. Let's hope this one lasts longer! 




 Apparently for Mark Cuban, it's only "un-American" if you're coercing a "job creator". 




 In recent history Putin has done exactly the opposite of what American analysts said he would do. I think it's pretty safe to say that we can just play The Opposite Game and we would have Putin's complete strategy. 




 And how is that different from prison guards in real life? Do you think guards do not actively play out fantasies where they are in a powerful position, or do not take cues enabling abuse from their superiors?  




 I would be a bit more optimistic and say that's slowly changing now. Especially with the advent of "big data" like in genomics, more and more statisticians are entering biology and demonstrating the use of confounding variables and "cage effects" for animal models. The basic problem was that historically sample sizes were so low that researchers didn't feel the need to or could not filter their datasets against secondary variables. Many were just not trained in these techniques at all, but newer crops of scientists are. 




 The large coffee (20oz?) would then be approximately the same price as a Starbucks Venti. If you're normalizing for caffeine content per dollar then it's not even a contest. If you're in a major Canadian city I don't think you'll have a problem finding a Starbucks or even a local coffee shop with better beverages for similar pricing, but I guess if you're on a road trip then Timmy Ho's might be your only option. 




 Canadian here. Why do people like Timmy Ho's so much? That place is disgusting. The coffee is watered down and sandwiches are basically no better than prepackaged. 




 Where do you put your used floss and other unflushables if you never noticed you had a trashcan in the bathroom? 




 Why not ginger? One of the best anti-nauseants besides marijuana and you're not rotting your teeth. 




 Whatever guys, I loved CoD Ghosts. I bought it heavily discounted, which probably helped. The biggest black mark that I can give against it was that the campaign was too short. It took me 2 days to beat, whereas Splinter Cell Blacklist took me at least 5x longer with a more engaging plot. 




 You make a great point, but it still makes me think about how the American military's logistic machine is basically subsidizing that of its allies. Nations ask the US for logistic support *all the time* and yet they pay very little or nothing for it. Wouldn't it be more fair to create an international force for this (eg. UN-based), or for each country to invest in similar capability, or even allow the US to send another country a bill for services rendered? 














 I think the big difference, like you said, is "focus". For someone who is good on the keyboard, it's way too easy to zone out and just transcribe on a laptop. On the other hand, people write much slower and have to focus and condense before they write. 




 Just wanted to point out that it's okay to show up to a party alone, have a few beers and conversations with a few people, and then politely leave. At least, during my late 20s (I just turned 30) that was perfectly accepted. In college people used to call you lame if you left a party at 10pm. People my age now have jobs and other commitments, and we appreciate that you took the time to even come out for a drink. We also don't hold it against you if you don't show up, so don't feel any pressure to come if you don't want to!

Part of being extroverted is realizing that everyone just wants to feel comfortable and wants their peers to feel the same way. Unless you are with a group of assholes, nobody is judging you. Even strangers are ultimately interested in facilitating a good time, because embarrassment for you is an awkward situation for them. 




 This was my strategy as I turned into a young adult after college (because being an undergrad does NOT count as actual adulthood). When I got older though, "not giving a fuck" got refined to "being carefree". I'm 30 now, and there are a lot of important social cues and lessons that people need to pay attention to and "give a fuck" about. The rest deserve neither sweat nor tears. 




 Google Talk was an awesome lightweight client until it started integrating with Hangouts. It would boot up instantly on my old Gingerbread phone, but now it takes at least 3-4 minutes to even get to a typing stage in Hangouts. Also as the video chat capabilities got better, it started getting more and more flaky -- sound randomly not working, and thrashes the CPU to 100% during a webcam session. Not to mention that it now pops out to a new window for a video chat with no way to pop it back into gmail, meaning that the option to multitask was completely eliminated. 




 You should listen to Dinosaur Jr. They were part of the late 80s/early 90s grunge movement and are still around making great music. 




 I don't think it's as simple as the quantity of oil production. My skin returned to being extremely oily but I don't get the severe nodular kind that I used to have. 




 My skin was dry as fuck when I took accutane for five months for extremely inflammed nodular acne. When I stopped (~4 years ago), my skin returned to being extremely oily. No more acne though, except in recent years but those are just occasional little mild things.

I still had extremely inflammed pustules on my scalp, and a doctor suggested that it might be seborrheic dermatitis. Coal tar and salicylic acid shampoos didn't do anything. I even stopped using hair products for a month. About two months ago I decided to use the "clinical strength" Head and Shoulders with selenium disulfide. Boom. In two days it was completely gone and I haven't had anything since.

So in short, my oily skin did come back, but it appears that something changed about it that prevented the growth of severe acne on my face. 




 What about things like visual programming paradigms like LabVIEW and related platforms? You could make each of those modules secure and follow good standards, and these could be the building bricks for larger applications. 




 I don't think that's the case. The IRS already knows almost everything about you and the eligibility criteria for most tax breaks, so prefilling it would work for 90% of the families that make a salary and do a light bit of investment. 




 It doesn't matter -- if you are a regular Joe that makes a salary, the government already knows how much you make. Your employer also sends out its own W2 records to the US government. For many investments, the government by tax day knows how much money was cashed or moved around before you even submit the form. Even 1099s get submitted to the IRS too, so I'm not even sure why there is even a need for "adjustment" if they mail you a 1040. That should only be in the 1% of cases and even then you'd think the IRS would apply all possible tax breaks to you because *it knows everything about you already and knows all the eligibility criteria for every single tax break*.

It's just inefficiency at its worst. In places like Spain they just mail you a card that says "This is what we think you owe or what we will give you back. If it's correct then don't do anything." 




 Energy and telecom are the two biggest industries to be privatized when I was growing up in Canada. 




 I've had those comments too -- I think that some deodorants probably have a much stronger scent than cologne. 




 I think it really depends on the woman. It's a pretty light fragrance, but some prefer the musky kind. 




 Also, no makeup is infinitely preferable to your face being completely monotone/flat. You need to know how to use the blush/etc otherwise you'll just look like a ghost. 




 Coal plants spread more "radioactively active" isotopes than every nuclear reactor ever made. 




 To be fair, we have no way of knowing what this person does during tax season. For all we know he or she could be getting a big fat refund from the US government. 




 Also, many doctors give out antibiotics prophylactically for those who have a medical history of secondary bacterial infections. 




 The difference is also that it's also infinitely easier to delete an entire directory in Unix by typoing. Most people use File Explorer with Windows.

For me though, it's way easier to accidentally move a lot of files/folders somewhere in Windows. Especially with a flaky trackpad or mouse. 




 I don't think people realized how variable crop yields were before the advent of industrial agriculture and now GMO. Developing countries would literally go into famine in one bad year. And those who advocate intensive farming, most of these farmers also hold second jobs as supplemental income. Intensive farming is hard to implement because they simply don't have the time for it unless you're promoting a perpetual class of farmers. 




 Not to mention that *seed quality* is extremely variable, so no farmer who is worried about year-to-year yield would pile their "natural" seeds together willy-nilly. Not only are farmers paying for resistant seeds, they also pay Monsanto for the QC. 




 That's not quite correct. Even if life elsewhere required oxygen for large organisms, there are a variety of methods to liberate it from existing compounds. 

Personally, I believe that it's very possible that life could be *everywhere* where there is liquid water (because it is polar and conducive to a lot of chemical reactions). The reason is because many planets have energy sources -- whether it be from the sun or from geothermal energy or nuclear heating. Likewise, life was thought to have started from geothermal vents on Earth. I believe that all you really need is a source of energy, water (or any medium to conduct chemical reactions) and the basic elements which are already abundant in the universe, and life will find a way to emerge. You're talking about billions of years, so it's not out of the imagination to think of bacterial organisms with enzymes that break down compounds to make oxygen; which then evolved to much larger ones.

Case in point: how cool would it be to have bacterial organisms that evolved to break down *water* into its constitutive elements? You would create a proton gradient to generate energy, and oxygen for respiration and chemical reactions. Then you can take that evolutionarily in so many directions. 




 This is fucking stupid. What's next? The USA is going to refuse F1 and J1 visas for students/postdocs/visiting professors? Leave politics to politicians. You're unnecessarily punishing scientists and astronauts, people who have exactly zero influence in public policy and have zero clout with regards to events in the Ukraine. 




 It's quite telling (and quite shocking!) when the only complaint about Windows 8 is the UX. Everything else about it is practically perfect. It boots up in seconds. It's fast and stable. There are just so many glaring design issues that make it such a tragic operating system. I use the OS on my primary computer and I have never used a single live tile. I've tried using the Metro apps but they never made any sense to me. 




 So nothing's changed since the 1990s? 




 So basically, the 1990s. 




 How many of their artillery and shells do you think are still functional? How many of them have been properly maintained over the past 60 years? Quality matters over quantity. Similarly how many of their rifles do you think can function in a real firefight? How many of their starving soldiers can actually function as effective infantry? It's probably pretty pathetic. 




 Afghanistan failed to "rebuild" for reasons that North Korea will never face. NK doesn't have rampant tribalism, ridiculously low literacy rates (which is surprisingly high in NK), random acts of terrorism, etc. 




 Definitely check out the related links if you want to get into the weird part of youtube. 




 What the fuck. Sirius black is Gary Oldman?! 




 Then why don't you do just that -- take out a line of credit to pay off your student loan? It's almost stupid not to, considering that the cost of education in Canada (where I grew up and went to college) can be pretty minimal so the size of the line of credit wouldn't even be that big. 




 People who proactively see the doctor about ailments have better health outcomes. This means they effectively reduce the burden on the total system by not waiting until the last minute to go to the ER or until something requires major surgery. If you can pre-emptively treat it at your PCP then you save the government fuck-ton of money.
 




 People who are comparing Iraq and Afghanistan to Crimea are also totally missing the point. Say whatever you want about false pretexes and oil, but economic extraction and occupation are completely different than outright annexation. The United States is not interested in absorbing countries, but would rather use economic hegemony to influence countries. The rhetoric also matters here: Putin is using nationalist language in order to outright turn these countries into *a part of Russia*. This means being subject to Russian laws and (lack of) civil rights including things like freedom of speech. What if you were a Crimean journalist or a gay-rights activist? It might be rare, but let's extrapolate that to Eastern Ukraine or the rest of the Baltics.

The United States allowed Afghanistan and Iraq to form their own constitution, set of laws, and have elections. Sure, they may have had a hand in influencing them but for the most part they left the details of governing to the people there.

This is even worse than during the Cold War, when the US and USSR were setting up puppet states across the world. They were part of respective economic and governmental cooperative spheres, but participating states could by and large do their own thing. What Russia is doing today is much more aggressive regardless of whether he intends for Crimea to be an "autonomous" region or not. It sets a dangerous precedent for the neighboring regions. 




 The whole argument for armed guards everywhere is completely ridiculous. The fact is that the USA is one of the safest places in the world to live. It's the media that's inflating the fear of violent death. Violent crime is typically concentrated in bad neighborhoods and ghettos, where the police are reluctant to do anything useful (for various reasons I won't get into here). Violence also is particularly pronounced for certain ethnic groups. If politicians and the police force were actually serious about saving lives, they would actually direct resources to areas where they would have an impact instead of making a big show out of it. 




 Armed guards will do nothing against terrorism. Remarkably, airports are one of the most safest places on the planet. They are "sanitized" to the point of being slightly disconcerting. If you take a look at how many gun-related incidents (even aggregating for check-in versus boarding area), it is so safe that putting armed guards at every airport is a complete waste of money.

Take the shooting at LAX for instance. What is a better use of money and can save more lives: actually training a better police force and reducing gun deaths in LA proper, where many more people die every day, or putting guards at one of the safest places? 




 The thing that I like most about TJs is that while the produce quality isn't the greatest, the prices are fair compared to other stores. I live in the Bay Area, and buying something as simple as berries can break your bank if it's at some place other than TJs. They may not last as long or be as fresh as Whole Foods, but they are solid for the price you pay. They sell some non-TJ brand stuff there (off the top of my head they sell a particular brand of cold cut meats and also Nature's Path cereal) and these prices are literally *double* of a grocery store that is 5 minutes away by bike. Same with vegetables like tomatoes, asparagus, spinach, etc. I don't need to pay $6 for each of these items, yet when I shop at any other place that's what they will cost. 




 The US invades, but that is very different than outright annexation. 




 Some historical perspective: after WWII, the US was basically last man standing aside from Russia. As the world rebuilt the US was effectively the West's *entire* military arsenal. We were basically taking on the bulk of military spending for Western Europe. This carried on to its present day where American forces are practically subsidizing everyone else's military force.

Nobody is going to "chip in" unless (1) the US significantly reduces its own spending for others to get nervous, or (2) the US signals that it might not defend "friendly" countries. The problem is that nobody seriously thinks that the American military-industrial complex is going anywhere soon, so no country is willing to pay their "fair share".

I hope the Ukrainian situation will shake things up a bit. To me, NATO is basically an American subsidy to another country's defense budget. The reason why American spending is the equivalent of the defense budget of the next 17 countries is that we are basically absorbing the defense budget for countries that "can't afford it" or have decided that other things in their budget are more worthwhile. Therefore it makes a lot of sense for weaker Eastern European countries to join so they won't feel as threatened by Russia. But the US can show a lot of military restraint here, so that these own countries can spend a little bit more to what would be an appropriate contribution to continental defense. 




 The nanodrop is great at getting a rough idea of a sample's concentration. But if you want something more accurate you should look into something like the Qubit by Invitrogen. It can do DNA, RNA, and protein samples too. Many labs use it for next-gen sequencing as it's very sensitive to loading amounts and it's really unparalleled. 




 I used to own an LG Voyager and my gf still uses and env2. Those things are tanks. I complain all the time about how my smartphone is now so laggy, but those things just power through with no lag. Very responsive. Even the shitty web browser didn't freeze half the time on a webpage, which was great for briefly reading the news. I miss those days when you didn't have to wait for anything on a phone. 




 There are also many access programs for people who can't afford the drug -- some are even administered by the drug company themselves. It's not all roses, but intense lobbying by patient advocates in the past 30 years has really improved drug access. 




 Unfortunately, the actual discovery of the drug costs much less than the amount of money dragging it through trials. Sure, most initial ideas for medicines come from NIH grants but it takes a lot more to commercialize it. 




 If you had a time machine, you should move to China! It was crazy back in the day, especially in Beijing. There's still a lot of bicycles now, but many more cars too. 




 LOL @ 6:30 




 Certainly the bulk of the virus is in the Congo/CAR, but for example Nigeria and Ghana are at the tips of the giant hotspot where Ebola and other viruses live. Ghana is actually doing pretty well compared to the rest of Africa, and Nigeria has a growing oil economy and is slated to be the next wave of "BRIC" countries to fight out of poverty. If you look at a map Guinea is much farther west than where Ebola infections typically occur, which is actually very disconcerting.

Generally speaking, many African countries have been enjoying steady growth in the past decade. There are definitely a few that have systemic problems/are a total shitshow, but people are definitely not as pessimistic as in the 1990s. 

Edit: here is a nice quickie http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/01/daily_chart 




 Why? Near the Ebola hotspots there are many countries that are developing very well. In 10 years many of them will be in pretty OK shape -- like South Korea when things were starting to take off.

Edit: not sure why people are downvoting my optimism for the African continent. It's a known fact that many African nations nowadays are doing much better than in the 80s and 90s. http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/01/daily_chart I guess stereotypes about developing the continent die hard... 




 There sure a lot of conspiracy theorists and cynics on reddit who think that the US dominance in the world is somehow without a strong foundation and can come crashing down at any point. Many countries have tried going toe-to-toe economically and have failed, and even more have practically collapsed when the US dipped into a recession.

The "age of American decline" is total horseshit. In fact, the world is disconcertingly getting more and more dependent on the US economy.

As to your point about China: in complete contrast to Russia, which turned into a shitshow grab for power in the collapse of the Soviet Union, China is now run by a bunch of technocrats and a rolling roster of them at the top. Compared to Russia they may both be brutal, but China is prudent and Russia is brash. 




 It's pretty much a guarantee that once Africa fights its way out of poverty (10-30 years from now), Ebola will be a much bigger issue. Hopefully scientists here will have the foresight to spend more on researching it, instead of waiting around like Malaria. 




 There is a lot of talk about Canada's plans to sell their oil to China if the Keystone pipeline doesn't go through. I think there's already talk of them building a pipeline to the Pacific coast to ship oil there. I think that China would prefer to buy from Canada, considering they tend to stay out of most countries' affairs and Russia is not exactly economically stable. That and there are huge amounts of Chinese financial interest in Canada in the form of real estate and stakes in other natural resource companies. 




 I don't think P2P streaming video would ever work except for the most popular videos -- the ridiculous upload throttles set by ISPs basically ensure that there will never be enough bandwidth to go around. It will never scale up. On the other hand, the distribution infrastructure doesn't suffer from this problem. 




 Something I've always wondered about tamago: if it's truly made like how it is in the video, how does the first part of the tamago (which is in the middle by the end of the clip) not be completely overcooked by the time the brick is finished? 




 I'm not even sure that it's catering to fans at this point. Marvel has created lots of *new* superhero moviegoers in the past few years. Captain America was never really an A-list comic book hero, either. I think Marvel's just very good at making good movies, despite the fact that every large studio on the planet is absolutely terrible at it when they are given a large amount of content control. 









 In fact, I think the only Asians to eat things off a plate with a chopstick are probably Koreans and Japanese. It's starting to move into Chinese culture but it's still very awkward to eat food without a bowl. Even SE Asia use forks and spoons because of their colonized past. 




 Whaaaat? 5:1?! I have cooked long and short grain rice all my life -- in a stovetop and in a rice cooker -- and I have never used as much as 5:1. You might be setting your heat up too high if you need that much water. Long grain rice is perfect at around 2:1 or even slightly lower if you like it firm. 




 Most of the other European countries are all talk at this point. They are desperate for Russian gas and are terrified of their economy. But Merkel knows Germany can hold its own and actually has some balls to throw some sanctions and tough words to Russia. Germany and Russia can have an economic fistfight and it wouldn't even be fair, as the former has a diverse and healthy economic foundation while the latter constantly flirts with disaster. 




 I think some world governments had a pretty good clue of where to look but were holding back their capability to give the Malaysians a chance to sort it out themselves. 




 Not in the same timeline though, so I don't think it counts! 




 I think they got the tone of ASM right. He was playing a high school kid, so that means a part of their target audience would be young teenagers too. The movies grow up with the target audience. I feel like the Harry Potter movies really did this right, but obviously they're not going to make 7 Spider Man movies in the same timeline. 




 Are you kidding me? I guess that's worse than one that I've heard recently: many CS grads can't code a basic main() function in C++. 




 I don't understand what Putin was thinking. In the medium to long term, it was likely that Crimea would anyway separate from Ukraine after the "revolution". There were a million other things he could have done besides send in troops and hold a snap referendum that wouldn't result in alienating everyone. 




 Check out Biomatrica. 




 But why aren't there more "processed green vegetable" foods? There is some nutrient loss, but not a whole lot when you are looking at what you get versus eating hamburgers and fries all day. The only ones I can think of are veggie chips and smoothie drinks, but not many more. 




 Atheist here, but just want to chime in: I think it's pretty clear from the quote in the parent comment that "just and perfect" should be interpreted in a metaphysical sense. Life on Earth is flawed, but the afterlife in heaven is where these ideal characteristics are manifested and can be experienced. 




 The Aussie radar system is pretty damn good too. I'd be wagering that Western intelligence is already analyzing what happened on their own, especially since there could have been a terror/national security element to the disappearance. 




 It's not WWII. A war with Russia will be over very quickly. The Russian military has declined dramatically since the Cold War, while American spending has risen. If we are speaking solely on conventional warfare, you have 20+ countries fighting one. If the ME starts to get involved (Syria's hands are tied at the moment), you have basically Israel and Saudi Arabia versus Iran. Neither of these are anywhere near fair fights and all of the countries who will be on the receiving end of a beatdown know that.
 




 People are appalled at why the USA is so cozy with Saudi Arabia, but the fact is that they were probably the most important, if not the only, factor that led to the collapse of the USSR. The US will never forget that -- for better or worse they will be bros for a long period of time. 




 Russia isn't the USSR or any kind of other rogue state. If its economy collapses the government will lose popular support. Russians will be smart enough to see that war will not fix an economy. They saw that 25 years ago and many people are still alive from that era. The only reason Putin still gets any kind of popular support with Ukraine is because they are still "doing okay" economically, but citizens will turn on their leaders when that disappears regardless of how strong the military is. Millions of Russians and Eastern Europeans died in WWII and the Cold War, so they are not eager for a larger conflict. 




 I don't think you understand how cell phones work. They are not satellite phones. They communicate with a tower on the ground. A phone the size of your hand doesn't have enough power to transmit to a cell phone tower 30000ft (almost 10 miles) away, especially when towers can be optimized to transmit horizontally instead of vertically. 




 See the comment in this thread. Why is this chain of thought (toxin for bugs means we shouldn't be eating it!!) so prevalent? There are so many cases where certain foods or molecules are terrible for one species but fine for humans. One great example is that dogs will die if you give them chocolate, but the only effect it has on humans is getting fat. 




 Not to mention people think hitting the delete button on your hard drive actually erases something. 




 Gonna get downvoted to hell for saying this, but I couldn't watch Community anymore because of the same reason. All of the characters became these crazy caricatures that were only funny because they were caricatures. The jokes weren't even very funny anymore -- it was just being quirky for the sake of it. Case in point: the recent youtube video of the Dean rapping in the opening scene. It's only funny because it's random and unexpected, not because of any actual situational humor. 




 Cuddling. 




 Where did you buy your coffee? I live in the bay area and I can't even think of a place that charges that much for drip or espresso. The most expensive off the top of my head is Philz Coffee, which is like $2.50 for a small cup of drip. 




 Holy fuck, they are actually doing this? I wish I could upvote all the people who are on board with that plan. Screwing with Russia's oil and gas economy is the best non-violent way to deal with them. The US finally is showing their economic muscle and balls, unlike Europe who is in the short term unwilling to fight with Russia because of gas.
