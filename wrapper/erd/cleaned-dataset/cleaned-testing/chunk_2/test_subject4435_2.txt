 We're still here and the account is still active.
Probably not for long.
I wish he had listened. Next time one of these is posted I'll make sure to take screen caps. 




 See? Thank you. Tell this guy to listen!  




 Jesus Jumpin'. If your dumb ass gets killed because you didn't listen to the one person who knows what's coming, then I 110% support evolutionary theory 'cause that shit will be a prime example of survival of the fittest. 




 Shit. Okay. Eventually she's going to threaten you if you don't keep typing. She won't speak to you she'll just be reading over your shoulder. Warren called her Mel but I guess maybe he misheard her. Either way you need to get the hell out of there now. 




 Sure looks like it.  




 Yeah THAT'S what you should get from that... Warren was her date last night. She made him make the same post and the general consensus says she killed him, posted a few comments, and then deleted the account. 




 Okay dude seriously. Get out of where you are. Her name is Mel or something right? She's reading over your shoulder, right? Our questions, everything you type? Get a move on. Get out. Or you're going to end up like Warren. 




 I've only seen one more, but they're real! You didn't imagine them. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2jhj7r/hi_my_name_is_warren_ask_me_anything/ Deleted now but it was an identical post. Last night. His name was Warren.  




 Ask her about Warren and get your affairs in order. Don't drink the beer. 




 No... she chose to be an ex when the new shiny girl-toy was more interesting than her fiancee (me) was...
Loon calls are also creepy as hell. I've heard some odd stuff I couldn't place especially when I lived in the woods. Owls sound like a woman being murdered.  




 Has there been any news? 




 I can't find it! I can't for the life of me remember what it was called. Something about someone working late and there being an odd customer or something and then she ends up in the walk in fridge/freezer and then the thing woman whatever took her cellphone and made another post I think. 




 Well it's raining and I have a cold of some sort but otherwise I'm great. And yourself? 




 wat? 




 Ugh. I smoke out my bedroom window at night so I don't have to go outside and now I'm too creeped out. 




 I assumed the handprints were relevant.  




 I second the fox theory. I seriously woke up in the middle of the night and made my ex go out with a flashlight because it sounded exactly like a screaming newborn and I couldn't rationalize the noise. I was also terrified (thanks nosleep.) It was a fox standing in the middle of the road in front of my house making the noise.  




 Hey people who know about doppelgangers! Is it odd for your doppelganger to do things you do, including dating your significant other's doppelganger? I dated a woman for a few years after my son's father and I broke up and we would hear at least twice a week that we had just been wherever we were, or someone had seen us around town while we were actually on vacation, etc. 




 She's probably gonna kill you. Like that one who ate the girl in the freezer and posted from her cellphone. Nosleep Butler, any help there? 




 Where would you suggest we don't dig at? 




 The flower smell makes me think possession. Any family curses or deals with demons we should know about? 




 Read the sidebar, punk. 




 Says one comment but see no comment? Confused.
Don't answer or answer with "City Morgue, you whack'em we pack'em" or something equally silly. Could also call your phone provider from a different line and see if there's something up on their end. 




 I totally agree with the things with emotional significance keeping you safe. When I was a kid a lot of strange stuff happened to/around me. My parents got me a dog after my grandfather asked who I was playing with, while I was playing alone in the yard. They won't admit that's why they got her, of course. But I had her for 18 years and when she passed away we had her cremated so she could continue to keep me safe. My room (where her ashes are) is still the safest one in the house. 




 The anniversary could easily be a stresser for him, causing him to act out of character especially since he wouldn't know exactly what to do with his feelings. Hopefully the doctor's visit shed some light on what's happening. Stay safe OP, and stay strong for your brother. Please keep us updated. 




 OP if your brother has a regular doctor, I'd contact them and have him seen asap. Something may have scared him and he can't deal with it properly or something. My only experience with autism is my 4 year old nephew so the traits may manifest differently with age, but I know when Evvy is confused or can't process something, he acts VERY strange and sometimes creepy. 




 Removed cause it's an intro now that I've come back to comment. Update us Op? 




 I need to know how this turned out! It just.. died off. 




 Hey OP! Update? 




 Me too! What was that about? 




 Am I the only one calling bullshit on the parents reason for moving? They're looking for/running from something. And the date nights are suspicious. And the protecting you and someone yelling "wrong one" right before your parents came in your room, OP. I'm betting your parents know who took your brother and why. 




 Read this as "Call the poop!" I shouldn't be on here when I'm that tired. 




 Parent to parent, I'm sorry you're dealing with this. I think you may be eating your daughter in the casserole. You should check out/have the cops check out your neighbors. 




 Dude. Don't hurt /nosleep. Those of us who hang out here take it seriously and we're not hurting anyone else on Reddit by lurking on our own sub. If you don't like it, don't read it. Simple as. 

As for your hacker, I'd suggest forgetting your quest to make a bunch of people who deal with demons and stalkers and ghosts, hate you, and you should be pretty safe. 




 Do the missing letters here and there mean anything?
Edit: Too much nosleep. Disregard the question. 




 Read the title, started singing Barrett's Privateers. "I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier, the last of Barrett's Privateers!!" 




 Thanks for clarifying! 




 I'd call you a cunt but you don't have the warmth or the depth. Bugger off and leave us with our psychopathy in peace. :) 




 Take it to your neighbor like he said and wash your hands of the situation! 




 Maybe yes but maybe no. Don't put too much pressure on her to tell you the truth right now, as that may push her further away, if you know what I mean. But also if you feel you need to know, and she's behaving differently, then I'd suggest continuing to ask her gently. 




 Yes please! Tell us all the things! 




 Or there was a bike gang of monsters who interrupted them? 




 I need to know more! What has happened since? 




 I'm excited for this to be continued! I have a bunch of those closets in my house. The only one that has a handle on the inside is the one in my bedroom. 




 So wait. We think Gabe did something awful to her? 




 But Johnny and shotguns! I second the southern accent. 




 Why removed?!
