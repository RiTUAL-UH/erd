 Socrates died for this shit 




 nitesmoke deleted his account. the admins have /r/wow now 




 There is no proof he received calls at work. Furthermore, the only thing "doxxed" was his dating profile which NITESMOKE PUT UP HIMSELF. 

He acted in a childish, stupid manner, bullied people, and we all know he called people fags on this very sub. Yet here he is as this social justice champion. Funny how he suddenly becomes a White Knight when he's the one being attacked?

He's a compulsive liar, don't listen to anything he says. 




 He deleted his twitter and reddit account to cover his tracks. 




 You all get Nitesmoke Wolf mounts and the title, Liberator of Gay Rights 




 I would be very wary of anything Nitesmoke is telling us. First, he comes out as some social justice champion for LGBT rights. What? That shit is completely unrelated.

Second, he's changed his story multiple times to cover up his own childish behavior. He couldn't play WoW for a couple days and had a suck attack. That's the whole story. 




 He wants to pass blame for having a completely over-the-top, inappropriate and childish reaction to "Wah, I cannot play WoW."

Instead of owning up to his actions, he jumped on the hot-button issue of today (LGBT rights) and became a SJW in a short paragraph of bullshit.

In the words of a famous Blizzard dev: Fuck that loser. 




 shit 'ead 




 You're a massive cunt nitesmoke 




 ME1/2 are on Steam, 3 is on origin. you can redeem your keys for 1/2 on origin too 




 We heard the same thing about SimCity. Frontier has set a release date and realized too late offline is not possible before release. They should move it into Q1 2015 




 I do microwave radio maintenance and sometimes drive 9+ hours into the field. I was looking forward to elite but that no longer a possibility for me 




 /u/imanasshole* 




 Watch Dogs is shit.

  COMES

 Yeah take this non-sourced, no-proof post with a mountain of salt. 




 And the stereotype about pirating continues. Let's all continue the cycle folks!  




 You mean in a reddit post without a source? 




 You are perpetuating the stereotype Yves sais during this made-up meeting. Nice. 




 I can write a long post saying working for EA is shit, using general industry complaints like the OP.  Still don't work for EA

 No, please don't. 




 playing diablo 3 




 and the rest of us can't even login wtf. 




 The husband/wife duo in my guild are the only ones who can log in. Our entire guild is level 91 and they're already 96. Shit is infuriating 




  Ubisoft literally Hitler

 boycott ubisoft

 wow far cry 4 looks like more of the same! Buybuybuybuy

 omg why ubisoft keep releasing same game? 




 Didnt you know most reviewers these days have been "re-educated" to forget any number under 7.5? 




 Game reviews are notoriously shit. Their average is usually a 7.5 (when it should be 5).

6 = any number less than 6 does not exist in the game journalist's mind.

6 = worst pile of shit ever. Above average.

7 = might as we not exist. Good game

8 = good game. Great game.

9 = really fun experience. Awesome game.

10 = amazing storycharactersshitgameplay. Bioshock Infinite. 




 Playing Warlords of Draenor? 




 Anton Chigurh from No Country for Old Men was a sociopath with no charisma or likeable qualities. One of the best villains of all time.

Just because a villain is likeable does not make them a good villain. 




 Man never used a flair in his life. 




 Immigants. I knew it was them. Even when it was the bears I knew it was them. 




 *March 15th.  I wish I brought a TV.  Oh God, how I miss TV!* 




 Cut the shit. 




 Sh sh sh sshhh 




 Read the comics and find out :) 




 Thanos is the big bad dude in the Avengers/Marvel universe. All of the current Marvel movies (including the new Avengers 2 Age of Ultron) are leading up to Thanos' series called the Infinity Gauntlet.

In the comics, after stuff I won't get into for spoilers, he becomes a farmer. 




 Uplay has better service than Steam

 uplay

 better

That hurt to say 




 [Like Thanos?](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/53235/1074601-cosmic_powers_unlimited_01___silver_surfer_page_16_image_0001.jpg) 




 Get that cancer out of $60 in general. 




 KEEP YOUR HEAD ON A SWIVEL 




 Lei Shen was a great fight 




 Fuck you dailies.

Fuck you SPK Gaming. Shittiest guild ever. Kick me for tanking poorly after 6 days of 6hr+/day raiding in one week (when I sign up for 12 raiding hours/week), then you fuckers disband the next week. You guys fucking sucked a huge dick.

Fuck you PvP requirements for PvE cloak.

Fuck oqueue.

Fuck you Dread Wastes.

Fuck over a year of SoO.

Fuck some of my guildies who complain about their ilvl being low when they barely put in any effort. I fucking go from 500 to 566 in 2 weeks as a Blood/Unholy DK BECAUSE I LEARNED TO FUCKING TANK. I am fucking sick of carrying my guild for heirlooms (i am the only PvE player in the guild who has 540+ ilvl). 




 *slow down* 




 Diablo 3 is doing something similar with seasons. You start fresh each season (joining it is optional) and level up a new character from 1, with 0 gold or crafting materials. After about 6-8 months they'll reset and start season 2. 




 My first time tanking was on a bought Prot Warrior account. I paid to change the troll to Draenei male and went into Utgarde Pinnacle completely unprepared. No idea how to hold threat, no idea what any of my skills did. The group disbanded before the first boss.

The account was later banned for being traded lol. 




 You don't want the OP to learn about serpentine formations? 




 Most restaurants sell dark chocolate cakes, ice cream and other black desserts. However, I am not sure why you would want to play with your food. 




 Every MMO sounds glorious on paper *cougharcheage* 




 Get PayPal to dispute the transaction. If not, call your credit card and issue a chargeback. PayPal will withdraw money from his account, or put it into the negative if he already spent the money. If he wants to use his PayPal account after the chargeback, he will have to put his own money in to cover the negative balance. 









 Do not buy from brictop if he PMs you. He is a known scammer and scammed myself and a few others 




 Call paypal and your credit card company right away 




 If it was from brictop you got scammed 




 Invite sent 




 No. You are baby machines and always weaker than men. Suck it up, buttercup for Jesus. /s 




 They must be spraying the bridges with anti-troll pesticide because I have never seen so many loose on this sub at once. 




 Do we Anglicans get thrown in Protestantism? My church is super traditional and more like a Catholic church. 




 Looking to buy a GTX 670 2GB for an SLI setup. Looking to get one for around $120-150.

If the 4GB version works with the 2GB version (my current card), I can take one of those instead.

EDIT: ~~Bought one from /u/brictop~~ Scammer

EDIT2: Did some research AFTER I sent brictop money. Turns out he is likely a scammer. Called Visa and Paypal. Both said they'll get me a chargeback if I don't get the card in 2 weeks (standard shipping speed). Just a warning for others out there buying from this guy, use caution. Don't be like me and take people's word at face value. I'm just thankful I will be able to get money back. 




 Uplay, no buy. 




  things just break in my hands [every 1-2 years]

 cheaper laptops/PCs

There's your problem. I have a $1500 gaming laptop from 2008 that still functions great. 




 What is the melt value on the Merchantman? Also how much for the hornet upgrade and can I use said upgrade on my Specter (Ghost LTI) package? 




 What idiot buys a Mac every 1-2 years? They last a good 5+ years. Fuck, the one in my house still works fairly well after 8 with a bit of tuning. 




 How much for the Super Hornet upgrade? 




 Mortal Online is a shitty ghost town of a game 




 Did you even read her comment? They already spent their money on Macs. Besides, with a PC you're paying for Windows, anti-virus, Office, peripherals, hardware/software upgrades every 1-2 years.  




 Too bad the combat is awful.

 FYI to anyone considering purchasing the account - Blizzard is VERY on the ball when it comes to account trading. They WILL track your IP address, password changes, etc. to the account and will give a temporary suspension, without warning, if they suspect the account was traded (which is against the ToS). It has happened to me twice and I would be very cautious when trading any Blizzard account.

I have traded accounts like elite dangerous and eve online in the past, but they do not go to the extraordinary lengths Blizzard goes through to stop account trading. You've been warned. 




 890 Jump - because I'm an idiot who likes shiny new things.

Horney Ghost LTI - traded elite dangerous for this bad boy.

AMD Mustang - cheapest ship for around $30 that comes with arena Commander. It also looks cool. 




 What the hell are you talking about? Developers don't give money to publishers. The publisher funds the developer(s) and in turn, reaps the largest reward from sales. 




 Watching any sports, esports or similar event will be like that. I don't watch NHL or NFL but when I go to a live game I get super into the match 




 [It is offensive.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHMoDt3nSHs) 




 Westboro misread the story where Jesus curses the fig tree for not producing fruit.

GOD

HATES

FIGS 




 I am a Christian and one of the last duties Christ gave was for us to go out into the world, preach the gospel and baptize people in the name of the Son/Father/Holy Ghost.

But the way these street preachers "spread God's Word*" is not the best way to go about doing that imo.

I won't go into it much since this isn't /r/christianity, but basically Christians should follow like Jesus did - he performed miracles, signs and aided people *then* followed up with his message as people inevitably asked questions. Most of the stories or parables in the Gospel are told *after* someone comes up and asks Jesus "Hey, Rabbi, why should I do y or how do I do x?" I never recall Matthew 45:16 "Then the Son of God went out into Los Angeles and held up a sign and preached to all the sinful nerds and they were saved that day."

*Funnily enough, most people think "God's Word" is the Bible. In Islam, God's Word is a physical book (the Quran), while in Christianity, God's Word is Jesus himself. The Bible wasn't even completed and compiled yet when John 1:1 was written...
 




 A surprisingly refreshing, calm, straightforward and down to earth thread on sexuality in /r/christianity. Thanks for sharing with us and as always, you have our prayers.  




 Sold to vistoldak. Quick trade (had to run out for some errands, apologies for the lateness on my part). Enjoy the game! 




 Praise the Lord for their safe return! 









 What's new pussycat? Woahhh woah woah! 




 DIE ROBOTS DIE!!! 




 What is a specter? I own the M50 already so no need for another racer. 




 One problem I had: Where were the 3 new planets getting sunlight? 




 Not that hard of a choice. If you're going to focus on dropping off troops and some combat, Redeemer. For anything else, go with the Carrack. 




 Not as good as Sunshine? Where was the super lame slasher flick at the end of Interstellar? 




 Read The Time Ships if you havent. Fav sci-fi book that is a sequel to HG wells The Time Machine. If you think Interstellars ending was crazy, Time Ships will melt your brain. 




 I think you are being a tad extreme. This is an internet forum where we're all anonymous. I don't equate these discussions to persecution of the early Christians.

I was simply raising the point that this sub seems to downvote unpopular beliefs, despite said beliefs being grounded in scripture. A good sub should upvote any post worthy of proper discussion, regardless of one's opinion or worldview. 




 Didn't you know that in this sub we upvote life-affirming reddit-friendly (i.e. usually liberal) worldviews and downvote anything we disagree with, even if there is scriptural proof to back up said views? 




 A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again made me shed a tear. 




 You can go to the pledge store and trade me a ship there of equivalent value or a ship in your own hangar or RSI$ credit.

You can chane the name of your Commander in Elite on their website.

 Downvote for bad prices when I can get Reclaimer for 375 and Jump for 635. 




 You are delusional. 




 Releasing on the 13th is a deathwish. 




 No explanation, a "feature" that is integral to the genre itself and that every MMO has. Top voted comment.

Good job /r/mmorpg. 




 Uhh...they were referring to the H1Z1 game. 









 So far the [PC port is looking pretty good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1g2XGnN2jM) and the [first review gave it an 8/10.](http://www.videogamer.com/reviews/call_of_duty_advanced_warfare_review.html)

After Ghosts, I'm happy this is shaping up to be a great CoD.
