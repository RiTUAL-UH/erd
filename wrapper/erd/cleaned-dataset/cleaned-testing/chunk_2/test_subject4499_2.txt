 Came here to state this. For a second there I thought I somehow resubscribed. 




 I thought the same thing haha. 




 Cool thanks. 




 Damn, what a beautiful piece of work. You're a lucky dude/dudette. 




 Where does one acquire such a thing?  









 I just finally received a shipment confirmation email with a tracking number. Package is currently in Richmond, BC and is to make it to Calgary by Friday apparently. $65 brokerage fee? Wut? 




 Would you happen to be outside the US? 




 Never rely on hitler for anything. 




 Has anyone outside the USA received their box set yet? I am in Canada and still without mine and my wife's Christmas gift. Just curious, thanks.
 




 Yes. Then I would buy it when it came out. 




 Damnit, where did the time go? 




 BTBAM - The Parallax II

NIN - Hesitation

Deafhaven - Sunbather   









 Nice, thanks for the info! 




 So how's the DVD quality? 




 WiFiday The 13th. 




 Also, awesome username! 




 I bet /r/horror would enjoy this, definitely cross post it over there. Good work, looks awesome. 




 Me as well I would like to know. 




 Thanks, really looking forward to it now. 




 Goddamn that's nice. Did they give you an email when they shipped it? I'm still waiting on mine. Also, I'm in Canada so not sure if it'll take much longer. It's supposed to be the Christmas gift for my wife and I. 




 Best username for this comment. 




 I'm sorry. 




 My friend just sent me this link:

[http://www.redflagnews.com/environment-headlines/urgent-two-radcon-5-alerts-on-west-coast-within-48-hours-disturbing-video#sthash.r5bcV4br.dpbs](http://www.redflagnews.com/environment-headlines/urgent-two-radcon-5-alerts-on-west-coast-within-48-hours-disturbing-video#sthash.r5bcV4br.dpbs)

And I got to thinking that something seems awfully fear mongering about that video which leads me to believe there is some kind of hidden agenda. Not to say that nuclear waste seeping into the ocean isn't a huge concern for every person on the planet right now, but something about that video didn't seem right to me.

I just wanted some sort of scientific take on the matter. How imminently fucked are we really? Can it be contained? Does it require more attention from the world than it is getting? 

Thanks in advance.

 




 William Peter Blatty's "The Exorcist" and "Legion". I loved both of these. 




 [Okay](http://i.imgur.com/yZDgZJt.png) 




 That's not the point. I wasn't trying to promote self loathing here, more the idea of self realization, in that you are among the masses creating the traffic problem. It's a humbling and calming gesture to understand that every single person on the road around you would like to get home as badly as yourself. When the roads are as bad as they are we owe it to ourselves and each other to exercise extra precaution, and seeing each vehicle as another human being can help alleviate some of that anxiousness and frustration. I find that it works for me anyways, it's easy to ignore the thoughts and feelings of those around you when you're separated by metal cages.    




 That is awesome.

 [Although I don't find his music overly relevant anymore, this song still gets me.](https://youtu.be/Rthl_O4_G2o) 




 - New inexperienced drivers

- People with zero winter condition experience (from warmer climates)

- Impatient ~~20 something~~ people with giant 4x4 trucks who think they can         stop as fast as the can accelerate

- Old people/nervous drivers white knuckled at the first sight of moisture (this could go back to my first point)

- Tailgaters

- Insufficient snow clearing of Calgary roads

- Overpopulation (road design doesn't match population boom)

To me it's everyone in unison forming one giant problem. We are all to blame, whether or not you're the perfect driver, you're still in traffic, which to me makes you part of the problem. 

Just like the idea of the zipper merge on an engineer's notebook, it looked great on paper but as soon as you throw a bunch of different personalities behind it, it becomes a cluster fuck. I think patience for one another is the key to making our [drive time commute](http://youtu.be/Dvx5GL_9MD0) a little more tolerable.

I have to agree with /u/Ardal and the police on this matter. Let's all slow the fuck down, take a breath, and let's get home in one piece without having to call our insurance companies.

 









 Nice man, I almost didn't buy it so glad that I did. 




 This was the funniest comment I've read all day. I don't actually laugh out loud very often. 




 Hello Mr. Reznor.

First off I would like to simply say thank you, your music has accompanied me throughout the past 19 years of my life, I am a huge fan and very grateful for the wonderful music you have brought into this world.

1) As a new father my life has literally changed a great deal (for the better). I wanted to know how you deal with being away from your children while on tour, and how else being a father affects your career.

~~2) This question has probably been asked more times than anything else but here goes, I know that both you and Maynard came to an agreement that tapeworm wasn't ranked as a 10/10 by your standards, however, will we ever see a collaboration between you guys in the future? Do you guys keep in touch, and/or humor this idea?~~


Thanks for dropping by.

EDIT: Please ignore question two.
 




 [I imagine it would be a lot like the covenant from Halo.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_(Halo) 




 Either or, I am willing to drive to dreadmonton. 




 If they came to Calgary I would be so happy. 














 What power? 




 Instantly reminded of these guys.

 [Evergreen Terrace - Everlong](http://youtu.be/zZ2iw-kaa-k) 




 Very well put together argument. 




 Awesome brother! Glad it all worked out. Again sorry we got split up at the end. Enjoy the gold! Tell me what it does actually because I'd love to know haha. 




 First off I want to give much thanks to /u/Xenophorge for the FREE floor ticket so that a friend of mine could make it, the four of us had a great time. I'd post the reddit love story picture, but I don't want to commit to putting my face on these parts just yet.

Having said that I want to say the show was fucking awesome, setlist had a little more top 40 than I would have liked but I could definitely live with it. The highlights for me without a doubt [Pino Palladino's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pino_Palladino) performance, the guy fucking nailed it and did it with such class and style. I really thought he fit the bill perfectly. Everyone seemed spot on and enthusiastic, however you could definitely sense how the tour was wrapping up though, almost as a sigh of relief from each performer. I won't say they were lacking energy, but  there was a definite aura of depletion in the air, in that each member was looking forward to resuming their family/home life.

I don't know if as a result of this the light show suffered a little or not. But we seemed to have missed out on a lot of the 3D effects that I have been seeing around these parts as of late. All in all it was amazing and I wouldn't have traded it for anything. 

Trent will never cease to amaze me as an artist, musician, and front man. The fact that he has managed to keep NIN relevant throughout my early teenage years and well into my adulthood blows me away. I hope he stays with us for decades to come. 

That is all /r/NIN, I just wanted to share a few quick thoughts with you. I love to hear what you guys think as well.

 




 Yeah it was a gift, and due to our dry climate here they don't last very long. It was out of the box for less than 12 hours. 




 Canada. 














 Damn. 




 [What's wrong with Autolux?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilzH4eco7lA) 




 Decent argument and perspective. 




 I'm glad I'm not the only one to notice. See you around. 




 Yeah, it really should be /r/townies. 




 Me too. 




 Sure, it's all good. My shark moose post was just the most recent to spark my attention. It's really not about what I post, but mostly what others do. I lurk here for the most part, and I rarely ever go to the front page of this sub, so if I made a repost as my argument point then I really only have myself to blame for that. Having said that though, this has been something I've noticed for over a year now. Again, maybe I only check in at the wrong times or something, in the end I find this place uneventful and boring, with a lot of downvote trolls. Is it just me or do very relevant comments  garner downvotes? I don't get it, like most subs there has to be a moment of self realization that the downvote button isn't a disagree button, perhaps this one has yet to understand that. 




 rant Yes /r/Newfoundland, I'm talking about you. I've been subbed since the beginning of my reddit life, and in that time I've noticed the horrible trend that established itself here as the norm. Seemingly every post I see that actually has to do with Newfoundland current events, culture, or politics becomes a barren waste land of downvotes and ignorance. I don't think I've come across one thought provoking comment section to date. Yet, when a fucking cartoon like Christmas tree from the goddamn Avalon mall gets posted, watch out, something all the St. John's yuppies can relate to. It's obvious who runs this place, and it's too bad. Much like Newfoundland itself, where 90% of the island is overlooked because of loud mouth St. John's walking around distracting everyone from what else is happening. Seriously, A POST ABOUT A GREENLAND SHARK CHOKING ON A MOOSE GETTING SAVED BY TWO RANDOM GUYS GOT DOWNVOTED BUT THAT GODDAMN CHRISTMAS TREE SPARKED DISCUSSION AND NOSTALGIA. Sorry, didn't mean to yell, but that was the last straw. I'll check back in a few years and see if you got your shit together. /rant 









 I have a friend who may want to come, please stand by. 




 Went to Michael's. They're matted 22x28 frames I think. 




 Got them at the show I attended. 









 Hey thanks. It cost a pretty penny but worth every cent. 




 So what you're saying is the Avalon Mall is as important and iconic to the rest of Newfoundland and its people as it is to all the local yuppies? Yes, downvote for criticism I get it. 









 And here I am... 




 CTRL+F "Yo d..", ah, there it is. 




 I see. 




 Ok, so I'm a Newfoundlander living away from Newfoundland (big surprise I know), I was just curious as to what I'm missing here and what this could possibly have to do with Newfoundland.

EDIT: Typical r/newfoundland, point out how a post has nothing to do with Newfoundland and get downvoted.  









 Ok, I'm sorry. 




 I am in western Canada, and I love it here.

EDIT: Oil and gas is huge here, and I know that will always be a viable option. I'm really looking to keep my ear to the ground for new up and coming industries that I could possibly get into. 




 I'm a 31 year old licensed airframe worker that has been in my trade for 10 years, things are looking pretty grim in my industry and it may be time for a move in the next year or so. If I am to make a move, I want to make sure it's a smart one and in the right direction, with job stability for at least the next 40 years. I have a hands on skills with precision tooling, and mathematics has always been my area of interest. Although I don't feel it is necessary to continue working in the trades, I am also not opposed to it. 

I'd really love reddit's opinion on the matter.
 




 Dude, I'm sorry. 




 Bah 




 It's solid brass though, and it was a gift as well haha. 




 Hah! 




 It ain't easy being Canadian. 




 Absolutely, much appreciation went out to those behind it. 




 Yes, and he tripped and fell on his ass trying to get in. 




 Much force was needed to secure it together, the secret was to apply this force throughout the entire build so that everything sat flush and level as possible. 




 Probably magnesium, copper, and tungsten.  




 Hah, thanks, you too. Although this post was made late yesterday and my birthday is now over.

One is semi NSFW because of a naked woman bottle opener. 




 Yes it is megabloks. As far as I know the Halo franchise teamed up with them as opposed to Lego. After building this thing I thought the quality was great even though most opinions usually say otherwise.  




 No he doesn't, sorry dude. 




 Hey thanks. 









 Haha wow. Thanks! 




 [Here's the picture.](http://i.imgur.com/LRERSVm.png) 




 Hey thanks a lot, I will try and swing by tonight and check out both stores. 




 [I agree](http://i.imgur.com/3EOUqnC.png) 




 Hey thanks! 




 Me either. 




 Hey thanks a lot! 




 Thanks a lot, I was thinking they were a bit pricey. 




 Beautiful. 




 Sweet baby Jesus, thank you. 




 I much rather save the time and spend hard earned money. 




 Sigh. 




 I know the ugly Christmas sweater fad has pretty much run it's course over the years, but I would love to look as Christmassy as possible for my company party. Thanks for any help in advance! 




 Excellent pick. At the Heart of it All is a great choice. 




 Quake soundtrack maybe? 




 /r/gore

There you go you depraved sick fuck. 




 I shan't feed the trolls anymore. 




 Not really, just read the full synopsis of A Serbian Film, and the August Underground series. 




 Thank you. 




 The question: "Hello fellow horror lovers, have you any recommendations for something more depraved than AU or ASF?"

My answer: "Yeah, they're called snuff and child pornography"

TL;DR: The only thing more depraved than those movies (in my mind) would be the true horrors of real life. I believe you read my reply out of context.
 




 I'm sick for mentioning it? Says the guy looking for something more shocking and "ate up" than the infamous "baby" scene of ASF. How depraved do your horror movies have to be before it's reality, this is the basic point I am making. There's a fine line between art and an obsession with death. 




 Yeah, they're called snuff films and child pornography. Why the hell do you need more hardcore than either of those? I haven't seen them, but a quick read of their synopsis is enough to make me sick to my stomach. 




 I really don't know much about how law works, and I know a quick google search would give me the courts definition of "sane". However how does it make any sense that a human capable of murder, rape, dismemberment, cannibalization, and attempted zombification can be considered anything but bat shit crazy? I mean I get that he was well aware of his actions entitling his "sane" verdict, but I find the whole thing confusing. 




 This is the worst fan sub of all time, did you really expect an answer? 




 This picture actually made me laugh, thanks for that. I found your dog reminded me of [this guy](http://m.imgur.com/ME0q6h3). 

You should post him to /r/photoshopbattles. 









 Wow, this is really interesting. Thanks for the info! 




 I have that same "I want to believe" poster. I thought it was some kind of rip off of the one seen in [Mulder's office](http://biglight.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/MuldersOffice.gif). I wonder what the story is behind it. 




 Nasty little buggers. 









 Thanks anyway, good luck. 




 I know a guy who would kill for a floor seat in Calgary. I live here so if you had one I'd meet you.

EDIT: realized how insane that comment sounded after I wrote it. Seriously, my buddy has never seen them, and missed out on the floor ticket sales. 




 Yeah just pop the multiplayer disc in anytime you want to play halo 3 multiplayer. 




 Don't buy the DLC, I'm sure you can find a copy of Halo 3 ODST for cheaper than what Microsoft is selling the DLC for. All halo 3 multiplayer DLC comes with the Halo 3 ODST disc. 




 Hahaha. This is the best comment I've ever read. 




 I would like to say Heat. It's not scary, but I find it super intense, which is really the secondary wavelength of fear, enticing you in much the same way.

[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113277/?ref_=nv_sr_3](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113277/?ref_=nv_sr_3) 









 I know, it's fucking scary to think that us humans are capable of such atrocities. With all of our technological advancements and general understanding of our universe, it's almost hard to believe. Like anything I guess, it can be defective. The human brain that we are gifted unfortunately doesn't come with a warrenty, it's up to the rest of us to sort out these crossed wires. 




 I think I'm going to be sick.
