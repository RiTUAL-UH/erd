 I would probably have a panic attack. Cry a lot. Call my sister. No answer, travel to her apartment. Cry some more. Then take her car and drive a whole day to my parents house. Find my family and bury them all at the family plot. Take my dogs and live at my parents cabin teaching myself survival skills hoping I learn enough to survive. 




 Not a book but Thomas Nagel's The Absurd. It expressed and validated everything I felt my whole life. After reading that I decided that the meaning of life is to give life meaning. Felt 1000x happier. 




 I'll play Mario Kart 64, Star Fox, Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and Cruisin USA on the Wii every once in awhile. 




 I recently bought the Season One DVD. I can't decided now whether or not it's a good idea to watch it right now. I may binge watch. 




 Glee. It hit all the right teen angsty notes. And the rest of the show sucked after that. 




 Home - Dixie Chicks 




 The saying "it takes a village to raise a child" applies to my big family. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins are not afraid to discipline each other's kids or call each other out on shitty parenting. Sometimes we'll recruit a relative we think will be most effective to talk to another relative about their actions or behaviour. 




 They drive to the next town or drink in their homes where the cops can't see them. 




 I was 12 years old. Hometown has an adult dance after the family dance. This was before the town's alcohol ban so it was a pretty popular dance for the adults. I spent New Years at my grandmas where she was also watching her other grandkids whose parents also went to the adult dance. She didn't have a tv so we played card games all night. At midnight people started shooting blanks from their guns cos thats a thing here for big events. 




 Sunny Sweeney, Lee Ann Womack, Laura Cantrell, Jamey Johnson, the Secret Sisters. Still patiently waiting for their albums! 




 Amazons and Gladiators. The Room. In The Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale. All damn horrible. 




 Get "acoustic earplugs". I got some for $7 after I went to a rock/metal show. Didn't need them at all for country concerts though.. 




 As a girl who didn't know the difference between a tank top and a camisole, i have no damn clue either. 




 Believe what the tv tells them. 




 Boulder to Birmingham - Emmylou Harris

Whats Up - 4 Non Blondes 




 The movie "Giant". James Deen, Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson. I watched it on TCM one boring evening. Now whenever someone mentions they don't like old movies, I tell them to watch that. But it is a very long movie but worth it. 




 The Glass Castle - Jeanette Walls

The Alchemist - Paulo Coelho
 




 I really like being your friend. I think we could be very good lifetime friends. You make me feel like I'm capable of so much more. I'm also happy you're more comfortable with sharing your thoughts and feelings with me because it makes me feel closer to you. I don't want to lose you. But, if you're hoping for more than a friendship, it isn't gonna happen. 




 The Sarah Connor Chronicles. I'd never been so pissed off at a cancellation before or after and I'm still upset at my friend for introducing me to the show. 




 I tried this and my dogs understood but he just didn't care. 




 I sometimes think it's cultural and maybe a little bit biological. My dad is shy as well as my sister and me. My adopted siblings are not shy and neither is my mom. I was shy because I was incredibly self aware and that made me very self conscious. I had a happy childhood and was never bullied. Kids were always nice to me. I was sheltered a lot too. My dad and my sister learned to cope with their shyness by creating public personas but they're still very much introverts. I didn't create a public persona for myself but I learned to control my shyness after years of practice because I was tired of being shy. I'm still introverted though. It took years of practice, years of awkward moments, stilted conversation, and trial and error to learn to cope with my shyness and make friends for the first time ever. Dealing with my shyness is still an ongoing process.

I do think shyness is related to a fear of rejection. When I'm struggling with my shyness and force myself to be confident, I feel a sense of fear and if I feel I'm "rejected", it fucking hurts. But I think "fuck it," life is too short. I heal that rejection and move on.

I also think it's cultural because my old hometown was a very shy town. The people were just shy towards outsiders unless the outsider goes out of their way to be friendly, then they're accepted into the fold. But the new generation is not like this. They're very outgoing, friendly, and eager to experience new things.
