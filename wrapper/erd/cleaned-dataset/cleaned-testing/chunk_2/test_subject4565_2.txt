 THOSE BASTARDS! 




 Hey, those things hurt a little. A flurry of tiny micro-cuts could potentially briefly inconvenience a flight attendant... 




 But what if a little bit of the ice has melted, creating some liquid water? Does that make the whole bottle illegal? Or will they make you dump out the tiny bit of liquid water at the top of the bottle? What if the liquid water has formed on the bottom of the bottle, under the ice, and cannot be poured out? 

Will they take you in the back room and touch your b-hole for attempting to circumvent the rules with your snarky "frozen water" is not "liquid water" tirade? 

These are all questions I would like answered, TSA.  




 And you honestly believe they aren't? 
 




 I for one, am shocked... 




 Only 64,000 sigs left to go... 




 Did you fuk yet? 




 *Native Americans  




 Black licorice jelly beans. 




 Idk, what are the downfalls? 




 ... to Disneyland? 




 Bugington Energy? That name just sounds guilty. 









 I wonder if Mark would be willing to take a polygraph? 




 The Smellmaster 9000. I think Professor Keenbean already holds the patent on that device.  




 I love animals more than people. I would never. Unless I was attacked unprovoked... then it's on.  




 Nice desert wolf, bro.

Actually looks kinda cute, I'd probably try and play with it. 




 I would fuck a bobcat up. 




 u ded 




 Funny thing is you would probably do the same thing if you were locked in some aliens cage, and they were constantly staring at you from a far. Pointing. Mocking you.  




 The lion planned that. From your story, he even smiled and laughed to himself right before he blasted you. When you're locked in a cage, you have to create your own amusement.  




 Got that tektonic chronic that'll make you choke 




 Wut 




 Shut up. 




 Disregard the ignorance. I'm with you, buddy. 

People demand solid evidence when you bring up the topic of extraterrestrials visiting our planet, but fail to consider that the U.S. and other governments keep this subject classified at a level so high that only the top of the top has access to the information. In the past not even the President has been briefed on the subject unless in a "need to know" situation. People who come up with credible "proof" in the form of photograph/video have their original files confiscated or mysteriously lost or stolen. If their material does not go missing, they are threatened to keep quiet or face federal charges. In extreme cases, agents threaten physical harm to the leaker or their family if they choose to continue publicizing their story. On top of all that, there is an active disinformation campaign taking place serving to overload the public with bullshit/hoaxes/fake stories and sighting reports so that when something legitimate does come up, it will not be taken seriously and lumped in with the rest of the garbage. The topic of aliens is constantly met with laughs and jokes, *not because it is so improbable*, but because that's how we've been conditioned as a society to act toward the subject.

Acknowledging that aliens with a higher intelligence are visiting this planet would essentially brand all the governments of the world obsolete and irrelevant. Even more so when you take into account that they most likely do not know why the visitors are here and are powerless to stop them even if they deemed it necessary.  




 Now that's a reality show i can get behind.  




 Underwater cities?? Yes, please.  




 IT'S HAPPENING 




 Mushrooms are no joke bro. I mean any psychedelic is no joke, but your body can have some pretty adverse reactions to shrooms if you're not careful of potency/dosage/potential allergies. 




 mmmyyyesssss 




 Also took acid at the beach. One of the best times of my life. I saw... drones. Lots of them. 

"Actually" saw them, not "acid" saw them.  




  Growing up that's who i wanted to be/emulate whenever I played basketball. 

Ditto. From Philly. AI is legend.

Edit: Just a couple blokes from across the pond, both tryin' to be like AI. 




 Religion, woo!  




 I've got one in my dunge.... basem.... downstairs. I've got one downstairs. 




 Religion, woo! 









 Id hit it. 




 Cheers, m8! 




 Welcome to "The Watch List" 




 Sick! 




 "Good evening sir, I'd like to withdraw my life savings please. I'll take that all in ones." 




 Replace Bill Nye with Stephen Hawking and I'm down. 

Neil would totally be a bro and hold the j for S Hawk. 




 B. The spelunker in the vagina caves. 




 If I had that many tabs open at once, my computer would spontaneously combust.  




 Tabs on the timeline that say: Plot Setup, Foreplay, Blowjob, Cunnilingus, 69, Missionary, Cowgirl, Reverse Cowgirl, Doggy, Butt Stuff, Facial. In that order.  




 Monday. Suicide checks out.  




 Pussy pink like Nuvo and I dog that, Cujo 




 Clever girl... 




 Also, here's a good look at our current menu. 

https://www.trycaviar.com/philadelphia/tuk-tuk-real-958

The dishes themselves are mostly Mexican with different Thai spices and ingredients, depending on which you order. The Lamb Massaman Nachos would probably be our best (and most popular) example of a fusion dish.  




 Cheers! 




 Tuk Tuk Real on South Street. 




 Philly, close though. 




 Awesome, bro. I wish I was this creative.  




 WWED? 




 Bro, I work at a Thai-Mexican restaurant, you would love our Lamb Massaman Nachos. They're killer.

 You should end your life, not change it. 




 Can I hit it in the mornin' 




 Congrats at life.  




 Is all a nigga need. 




 And thank the lord. 




 Look into my big brown eye. A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long. 




 Look forward to trying some of these flavors.

Edit: Bought 2 sample packs. Came out to $40 including tax and shipping with the discount. Or about $3.33 a bottle. Can't beat that! Thanks guys. 




 Illuminati is conspiracy fact. 




 I feel like 90-95% of his target market thinks it's pretty cool too. Disc Golfers and weed go together like mashed potatoes and gravy. 

Edit: Ok, maybe it's more like 55-75% 




 Whatever lens this guy is using... I'll have that.  




 What am I looking at here... ? 




 We did Meth, Fag? 

Picture is accurate.

Confirmed. OP is the worst kindergarten teacher ever.  




 No WAY...

Mind = Blown.  




 I like to think this is how the universe came into existence... inadvertently... by accident.  




 Sounds like it :)

Sparking this bowl in honor of your pops. Cheers m8! 




 I heard this is how the MOB disposes of their bodies. No I didnt, but it would be awesome.  




 Bet 




  My father was one of the founders of Innova (big disc golf company)

Luckyy 




 Hyzer flip the bitch. 




 I need to get motivated to find some motivation.  




 Do it. 




 I think I just saw one in Philly 3-4 days ago. 




 You clever son of a bitch... 




 This is amazing. 




 This article says nothing about them doing anything physical whatsoever... 




 Mmm fried egg and bacon on a burger 




 Soy sauce spray........ GENIUS 




 Why would you soak shark fins in water and drink the broth? Oh yeah, the healing properties. 




 No. Their medicine tastes like root beer. 




 I would go the portable e-cig route with a dry-herb cartomizer/atomizer. Would be very cost effective, customizable, and portable/concealable. 




 Break up the door. Soak the wood in water until it had the consistency of wheat chex. Then add milk and sugar. Enjoy. 




 Those bastards! Honey Pit Cheerios.  




 Dat pineapple kush 




 So THAT'S why Michael Jordan was so good
