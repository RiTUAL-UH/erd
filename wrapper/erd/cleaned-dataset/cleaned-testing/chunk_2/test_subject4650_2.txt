 He might come in very handy as an Oden remedy.  




 FUCK THESE FUCKING CUNTS
 




 11 in the morning here in Melbourne, Australia. Dunno what you're all complaining about. :P
 




 Heeheehee 




 Sure, but it was IMPLIED. 




 Highlights: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsvBg9UQXus

You know, looking back on it, there were some great dunks but the competition itself has always been a joke. Nique's two handed windmill with his head over the rim scores 45 and Jordan gets a 50 for the same dunk he did in the semi round? C'mooonnnn. As a kid this was a really huge thing, but looking at it now, I kind of understand why the name players wouldn't bother with it. 









 I'll give YOU two wet balls in a minute. 









 Vince, MJ and Dominique Wilkins were absolute highlight factories, but there's no argument in my mind that Carter is the best dunker that's ever played in the NBA. 




 'Knoaf mate 




 But you have the athletic trainer of the year up there!  




 I think this serves an important purpose.  




 Dummies would be spat. 




 Gold is a nice way of spreading a bit of joy while supporting the website. Best thing to do is to pay it forward... Here ya go! :P

 I feel like the Hawks should take this one as a moral victory. Durant made a huge shot at the end, but it was immediately preceded by a bitch-ass push off no call and a rip-through. I reckon we should be able to expect more from KD.

I wanted OKC to win, but... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avr7enrZuJQ

Hawks' offense made a fool of the Thunder through the first 3 quarters, every basket seemed like an easy one, where the Thunder were struggling to get shots off and making some really tough looks. GG Hawks. 




 Blockrates?!? Hahaha!
 




 Plenty of post but it's also a great lens, I bet it's the 135 f/2 L.  




 I thought the same thing, but we did a cheap-arse wedding and it turned out to be one of the best days of my life.  




 For me, yeah. But that's because my camera only had one good autofocus point in the center there and I don't trust the others.  




 I think it might also help to use a fisheye lens or another ultra wide, then you can exaggerate the painted flowers and give the sense of being right behind the canvas instead of looking from a few feet away.

 It's called a go360. Here's me being a dickhead reviewing one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z201YXJX3c0 




 Doesn't show a lot of class going off for 70 on one of the worst teams in history in a total blowout. Then again, there was bugger-all else interesting about that game. 




 I dunno. He's not real flash at making in-game adjustments, but he's astonishing in between playoff games at taking away an advantage. 




 Well woop de doo. 




 "War is bad. It makes me sad."

- Melo's sole contribution to his University history class. 




 DMC stood on Paul's foot as he was trying to turn and run. 




 Everybody just wants somebody to beat the fucking heat.  




 Slim reapist? 









 He missed that free throw just to fuck with you. 




 It just occurred to me to check what the record for consecutive 30-point games was... Yyyyyeah, Wilt with sixty-fuckin'-five. Dayumn. 




 Amazing figures, considering how shittily he started the 4th quarter.  




 To me it doesn't look like it's quite stopped rising. 




 Good games for their time, but I think the ship has sailed. 




 Really? I think he comes across as a thoughtful, warm, stand-up guy. 




 Then again, I've heard it said that if you get a hold of somebody's chinpiece you can 'make their head go wherever you want it to. ' 




 Aussie here - I never picked a team, I just like keeping an eye on the league as a whole and catching as many games as I can from the teams that are doing awesome stuff at any given time. 




 I think it's actually a positive, kinda like Pop making sure the Heat don't get a look at the full squad before crunch time. 




 Since the Heat beat OKC in the finals, they always seem to be in the Thunder's heads. Maybe this is the year they turn that #2 self-perception on its head. 




 Also not to mention he scored a career high on Iguodala, one of the best wing defenders in the game. 




 On the other hand, as well as KD is playing, the OKC offense has long periods of total suckage. No movement, no plan, just give it to the Reaper and hope he can do something cool. I wouldn't be surprised if the Spurs take it comfortably, even if Kawhi ends up with a KD scrotum-print on his eye sockets. 




 That's not language. Get with the times! 




 What about making video players marginally less stupid so they can play the video vertically?  




 His hook shots have been money lately. 




 I think you're right, he's got one of the biggest verticals I've ever seen and he has a lot of style and flair. Although Blake and DeAndre occasionally unleash those giant destructo-dunks that are even more exciting. What Blake did to Pau, foul or not, was two of the best dunks I ever saw. 




 Ah righto. 




 Because LeBron denies that he's slacking off, maybe he's just running low on energy. 




 Why would he be angry at Deng? It's not like he had a say in the matter.  




 I like your new adjective there. PG got all dunkier-than-thou on the Clips. 




 Heh heh yeah been there - missus not impressed. But that only happens once or twice, after that the adage holds! 




 Looks like a decent rider stuffing around to me. No such thing as an unintentional wheelie. 




 Pacers forgot how to miss... 




 This should be a ripper game. I'm thinking pacers by 10 though. 




 But who the fuck understands the theory behind a pop hit? It doesn't matter. 




 Kids can emotionally connect with music without intellectually understanding it. Try that with your Dostoyevski.  




 Funny that so many cartoons use classical soundtracks. How can we expect kids to understand that?  




 Whaaaaaat? 




 ...scrogged.  




 It looks a bit... Fallen off of. I think you've just munted your resale value - and let's face it, this is a learner bike, you're gonna want to sell it within a couple of years. 




 Awwwwww! That's sweet! 




 YO MOMMA ATE THEM
 




 No way - no two guys move the same way in the air. Look at MJ's dunk contest efforts, there was nothing formulaic about those yet they just looked so damn good in slo-mo. 




 No way, he was saying in the lead-up to the contest that he had 4 dunks prepared that nobody had ever seen before. It wasn't improvised. 




 Nature's *other* dental floss. 




 It was always dogmatix here in Australia when I was a kid.  




 'Tis a bag of wank, sir! 'Tis not for riding. 




 Well you sure told them. 




 Nothing out of the ordinary. 




 Man, I LOVE the countryside, I spend hours just jumping dirt bikes in the mountains. Go play GTAIV if you want to be stuck in a big, grotty city. 




 YOU'RE A CUNT. 

Oh, sorry, are we starting yet?  




 I read somewhere that the uncle had been involved in price collusion with the Chinese over some NK business deals too... 




 You start with the body - tall, lean, strong. Unbelievable athleticism, the league had never really seen anybody who could just hang in the air so long. Watch the old game tapes, Jordan would elevate for a shot, wait for the defenders to drop out of the air, then shoot right over the top, have a coffee and come down. His hands were gigantic too, he could palm the ball at will, giving him amazing control on the dribble, or in the air, or grabbing steals. And his speed was absolutely stunning, in the open court he had an extra gear that nobody could keep up with. 90% of the time he looked like a coiled spring, running conservatively, but then he'd explode and it was amazing to watch.

Then there was the offensive skills - his touch was absolutely ridiculous, nobody has ever come close. He'd make layups the league has still never seen again, changing his mind two or three times in the air and kissing it in with a little spin off the backboard. His post game was just unreal to watch, that turnaround fadeaway was so deadly. He was an absolutely electric scorer, if the ball was in MJ's hands something amazing could happen at any second. Excellent vision, too, finding teammates or punishing a sloppy double - and if he got a sniff of the rim, he'd rise up and posterize ANYBODY in his way.

You could talk about defense - that sprung from his ridiculous motor. The guy was just ON all the time, an absolute energy factory and there were rumours he'd party all night and turn up and still demolish you. He was a constant threat on defense, not just on his own man, but a demon in the passing lanes for steals and most games he'd have one or two out-of-nowhere flying blocks as well. 

The competitive spirit and iron will just burned in him, he was the ultimate win-at-all-costs psychopath, to the point where it almost looks like it's ruining his life after basketball. He took *everything* personally, in fact if there was the tiniest reason to get pissed off with somebody, he'd make it his mission to destroy and humiliate them, and more often than not, these were his best games. Having said that, he never took a game off. You see LeBron and the heat coasting during the regular season - that would never happen on a Bulls squad, they just had a fire inside. 72 wins in one regular season is evidence of that.

And on top of all this and his many other gifts, he was also the most stylish player ever to take the court. Everything he did just looked so damn beautiful and in control. He was loose and fluid, but incredibly strong and athletic at the same time. If you played ball in the 80s and 90s, you'd see so much of MJ's style in the other kids - tongues out, scoop reverse layups, jumpman leg splits, people just wanted to be him. It sure didn't hurt that his Nike PR team concealed what a knob he was from the public so impeccably. 

So yeah - perfect storm. Outstanding physical gifts, unparalleled drive to improve and win, smart, skilled, creative, unstoppable and more marketable than pretty much anything the world has seen since. 




 Ah, you never know. Some people respond to Kobe's glaring style of motivation, others would absolutely hate it. 




 Yeah good call. The old one had much nicer colour and contrast than my 24-105, but it was just useless indoors. Blew me away how blurry every shot was. 




 Canon 5D3 lets you do it in-camera, hence a rash of similar pictures when that camera launched.
 




 Canon 24-70 f/2.8 - I haven't tried the new one, but I had the old one for a year and hated it. Lack of IS really killed it in the low light situations I expected it to shine in. 




 Canon 135mm f/2L. 




 Perhaps the balls dropped? 




 There's a difference between really bad and just completely destroyed by injuries. Bad luck has played a big part, the team was performing above expectations before everyone got carted away in the meat wagon.

 




 He should be there for sure, he's an absolute highlight machine. 




 Plus, y'know, proximity of teeth to balls.  




 Wow. 

If you were a boy scout I'd hand you an advanced turd polishing badge. That is very impressive.  




 Right on, it's no kind of path to peace or happiness. After all, what's the ultimate goal? 




 Forget variable NDs, they're garbage. 




 He acts like a child throwing a tanty. 




 Jesus, what a loser. 




 What's this from? 




 Haha I wrote about this a couple years ago, they're fasscinating! Couple of amazing videos of them at work too: http://www.gizmag.com/nuclear-icebreakers-double-acting-ships-azipods/20903/ 




 I think it's more than that. I think the US relies on massive military spending for such a huge chunk of its economy that it's become addicted to war. The country has deliberately stayed in constant conflict since WW2. Drop that spending and the country would be thrown back into depression.  




 *shudder*

Dude think of it this way: a new chain and sprockets makes the motor and gearbox feel amazing. I change my chains a bit more often than is strictly necessary just 'coz I love the feel of a fresh set.  




 You. You are a bad person.  




 I agree on both those counts, but he also comes off as a total knob end. 




 Yeah, now that you mention it. Aussie here and I reckon Bogut looks like a proper bastard.  




 Not only the initial impact, but the two jagged ends of each bone snagging and pinching all the muscle and tendon as the foot dangles freely. Ugh.  




 "Whoooo, a little more choke and that would've started! " 




 "Better an empty flat than a bad tenant..." 




 I'm not sure that's a bad thing. Aussie drinking culture is pretty gross. Source: ex-piskarn.  




 Unwatchable. 




 It sure seems like every couple of days another great player goes down. Anybody keeping a list? Is there any way to compare this season to others in terms of which seasons have been most impacted by high profile player injuries?
