 Rent kayaks at Granville Island, or motor boats.
Visit Museum of Anthropology, UBC, and wander the campus to the new museum with the whale skeleton (ask anyone). Go up Grouse Mtn, especially if the grizzlies are coming out of hibernation. Ignore the Capilano Suspension Bridge and go the free Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge instead, saving $35 each and avoiding huge crowds. Eat at a waterfront restaurant like Brana's at Stamps Landing. Get a car for a few days and drive to Whistler stopping at every roadside stop en route, including Horseshoe Bay.  If you have time and the weather is right, keep going up the Duffy Lake Road to Cache Creek, then return via Highway 1 through Fraser Canyon. Visit the Othello Tunnels in Hope.  At Hope avoid coming back to Vancouver Highway 1, take the much slower Lougheed Hwy instead, with maybe an overnight at Harrison Hot Springs (1970s style bourgeois). Cross back to Highway 1 at Mission to just finish the last bit with speed. 









 I'm a psychologist working in Vancouver and specializing in the treatment of depression (private practice fee for service).  But let's talk about some FREE stuff:

TOMORROW, Tuesday March 26 at 7 pm at Vancouver Public Library Central branch, Alice Mackay Room -  Out of the Blue: The Nature and Treatment of Clinical Depression. I'll be there to talk about treatment issues.  It's a pretty short (1.5-2 hrs) forum, but it may be useful for some people.

ANYTIME:  Consider visiting the link below to get a free copy of the self-care guide, the Antidepressant Skills Workbook, a written-in-Vancouver (but exported around the world) guide designed for physicians to offer to depressed patients - but also for anyone to download on their own.  Here's the link that'll get you to the download sites:
http://www.changeways.com/resources/aboutdepression/scdp/scdp.html

There is also a version for adolescents called Dealing With Depression (same link); I thought this post was going to be about that when I clicked on it!

Our clinic also developed a group therapy program for use in publicly funded healthcare settings called the Changeways Core Program. Mental health centres across Canada use it, and you can ask the facility you are referred to whether they are one of the ones that do.

I also have a blog on psychology-related issues at www.psychologysalon.com.  It covers a wide range of topics, but depression is one of the main ones.

It can be difficult accessing affordable (or MSP-covered) mental health services in Vancouver, but most hospitals do have outpatient programs.

One more free thing:  I have an online course on diaphragmatic breathing available on Udemy. The usual charge is $15, but redditers can sign up for the course using the Coupon Code "breathingreddit" and get it for free until the end of April.  Link:

That's not much, I know. But maybe it will help a bit. 




 Sanders Whiting (just google his name).  Musical theatre background, lots of experience. 




 WeLiveInPublic: Thank you for your feedback! As we mention on page 3 of the manual, it isn't intended to be a complete standalone treatment for depression - it's hard for us to imagine any print resource that would do that.  It's an add-on - something extra for people while they are being treated with TAU (treatment as usual).

But even given all that, it probably isn't all that it could be. I'd be very appreciative if you or others could make recommendations for things that you'd like to see added, or other resources that you would find helpful.

Many thanks. 




 Hmm. The ship responsible for responding should a tanker run aground (which is all but impossible, according to proponents of increased tanker traffic in BC), runs aground.  Perhaps fate is trying to send a message? 




 That's not a bad idea. Unfortunately it'll be a pretty boring post, and your mother could have written it. There's no magic foods, and it's best to have a balanced diet heavier on veg and protein, light on simple carbs, and avoiding sugar. Exactly the opposite of what you want when you're depressed! I might be able to spice it up a bit, though. 

And you're right, there is a lot of nonsense out there. If I hear the word "superfood" one more time, I can't be responsible for my actions. 




 Hey, redditors.  I'm a psychologist in Vancouver Canada. I treat people with a variety of stress and anxiety-related problems, and our clinic tries to get good, practical, and effective resources out there in the world for people to use.

Many of our clinicians are also part of Anxiety BC, a nonprofit organization that develops resources for adults and teens on the nature and treatment of anxiety disorders.  While working on a workshop on exposure therapies for anxiety (that I'm delivering Friday!) I learned that they've posted a series of short video clips for adolescents that are very informative - regardless of your age.  

Take a look, here:  http://youth.anxietybc.com/video/types-of-anxiety-problems/

There are clips for each of the major anxiety disorders, and subsequent clips (click the tab for "Watch us face our fears" on the left) of each of the cases confronting their anxieties using exposure.

Another resource:  I've posted an online 12-short-video-plus-handouts course on diaphragmatic breathing for anxiety reduction. I've created a Coupon Code - "breathingreddit" - giving redditors 100% off - so you can take the course for nothing if you like.  Here's the link to that:

https://www.udemy.com/breathing-made-easy/

There's a promo video you can watch without signing up or doing anything else. If you like the look of the program you can access it using the coupon code for nuttin.  

Hope you find these resources helpful! 




 I don't know the country you are writing from, Davidd00, and probably wouldn't know about policy or access unless it's my own unfortunately.  

But medications for depression, which do help for many, are known to be a bit hit or miss. There are few indicators of which one will work for whom, so it tends to be trial and error. Most psychiatrists would start with the same standbys that GPs start with, then work from there. It is possible, though, that the psychiatrist would be able to nail down a more precise diagnosis, which might give some hints about what to try first.

I'll just repeat one of the mantras I give my clients:  Medications are seldom a COMPLETE treatment for depression. People usually discover they need to do more. If a med lifts a person, it's best to see that as a window of energetic opportunity to make the changes they need to make, so that the improvement becomes more sustainable. 




 I don't have work on social anxiety, but I did write a book on communication skills: The Assertiveness Workbook, from New Harbinger Publications (Amazon has it). I recommend Martin Antony's Shyness and Social Anxiety Workbook (also New Harbinger) for straight-on social anxiety, though.
