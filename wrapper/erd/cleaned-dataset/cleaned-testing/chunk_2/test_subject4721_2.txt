 I remember going to the General Store next to Otto's and of talking to the man himself. he and my grandfather were friends. I remember going to the Penny Socials at the Smallwood Social Club and the building is still there, between Otto's and Friends Bar. Did you know Smallwood was a lesbian enclave for years? I saw Star Wars at the Rockhill Drive in as well as all the good Bond films. LOL

 Thanks for the site, but that's not where I found the pic. I was guessing from the pic itself what the ingredients were because I hate posts of food pics with nothing even basically trying to describe it. 




 (1) Peas, Mint Parm Cheese with Honey   
(2) Sliced Plums, Lemon Zest and Ricotta Cheese   
(3) Fig, Parma Ham and Brie   
(4) Avocado, Salt and Hot Pepper Flakes 
(5) Sliced Asparagus with Ricotta Cheese, Salt and Pepper   
(6) Grilled Peaches with Ricotta Cheese and Tarragon   
(7) Sliced Tomato over Pesto with Parmesan Cheese   
(8) Sliced Cucumbers with Grilled Corn over Ricotta Cheese   
(9) Sardine with Dill and Hard Boiled Egg over Ricotta Cheese   
(10) Granny Smith Apples with Chopped Hazelnuts and Honey over Ricotta Cheese. I think.

 Tip of the ice berg my friend, Via Con Dios. 




 Last year we celebrated at the sister in laws house and I made a Hot Pot for the first time and it came out great. Something like this http://imgur.com/g4JTFP8 but we used a large wok and cooked almost everything in it, each in it's own little area. It was delicious and I'm hoping to do it again this year. 




 All you need is a matching leopard print bra and panty and your all set! 




 Enjoying it by sharing through a visual experience, one that we all as humans share, the celebration of food. Finish it and you'll see whole communities come together for a few days as everybody, young and old alike come together and share a common tradition and love of food that dates back centuries. 




 Not my pic but take a look at the French Laundry Cookbook, I believe there's a sauce/dish recipe that takes 14 things to before you even plate anything. Having things organized like that in the food world is called Mise En Place and it makes it incredibly easy to cook things correctly. 




 Make sour kraut or Kimchi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqY22Y7hVgE 




 Last year we specifically did not go to the wife's favorite restaurant because money was really tight so we went instead to one of our usual steady standby places after checking the dinner menu online. Made reservations, showed up on time and still had to wait for a table but ok. Got our menu and found they had changed their dinner menu to a chef's Prix Fix dinner menu for $75 each and up. Shit! We talked about leaving, but we were there already, it was getting late so we decided to stay but with drinks we were going to be out at least three hundred and we got fucked over the table by the fire place by the cunt of a hostess (she admitted to giving it to regulars over our reserved spot) I can make the same kind of dinner for a lot less. I'm going shopping tomorrow and I'll see what's out there, steak, pork or lobster. What are your plans?

 WOW! Thanks for the time and effort that must have taken. This is one of the reasons I love reddit. 




 How about this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEFMJvFkimQ 




 Can you imagine the smell? It's gotta be like a punch in the face! 




 If there's not a "Chinatown" in your area try checking out any Jamaican stores nearby, I think they would carry it as well. 




 Sorry, just came across this one and liked what I saw. My vegetarian in laws would love every one.

 Yea but he was THE MAN when it came to calling out the republicans or most everybody on their shit. I just read that some think he'll replace Brian Williams as the News guy? 




 The wife and I love restaurant week. We're short on cash so every penny helps. Think of using it this way, don't go to a place you've been to before, try some place new that you would not ordinarily go to. This way you get to see the place, feel the vibe and try the food and if you hate it your not left with a feeling "wow, THAT was a total waste of time and money!"   
You can also see if your treated any better or worse because your having the "value" meal. Over the years we found the service, the food and the ambiance of a number of so called high class places so bad that we were so glad we didn't go and pay hundreds of dollars at the regular time. The waiter actually huffed at us when we asked for the restaurant week menu at Smith and Wollensky and when he slapped the menu on the table hard enough to knock over the glasses I got really pissed. Over all it's been a good experience and it's really made for people like us who other wise would not eat out in a big restaurant more than a few times a year.  




 Elvis or Andy Kaufman, neither which are dead. Either one would break the internet let alone reddit! 




 No, it came in a small plastic box as part of the promotion gift. It's brand new as well. There was a persons card and letter listing the shaker if the person wanted to buy more, it retails for 39.99 and was wrapped up inside the shaker, that's why it didn't make any noise in the thrift store.  




 Yea, I don't believe it either that's why I picked it out of all the others. 




 Sure, here you go http://imgur.com/a/Th6wp The only thing I would change is make the cut deeper so you could stuff it a little more also I forgot to take a picture of the pan finishing in a 350 oven for 5 to 10 minutes. You could also slice this and make one hell of a hero sandwich, that's what I was planning on doing with the leftover when I thought of the ramen. If you have any more questions just let me know, Good Eating!

 I used Pork flavored Ramen Noodles, carrots, baby bock choy, small amount chopped garlic, soy sauce and oyster sauce to flavor the broth. Sliced, pan fried the pork in olive oil and butter until warmed through and the cheese was crispy, then added salt and pepper. It was very nice and the fried cheese was a very nice surprise.

 Gotcha! It's just that sometimes I find those old books so unreadable sometimes. the prose, the wording, the story line itself you know? 




 Nice save. Are they worth anything? Because if not they look exactly like the type you can make a book safe with. 




 Sorry, not my pic but I'm thinking of doing this, hanging it from a heavy beam connected between two trees on my property in Upstate NY. Good luck 




 Just letting people know I checked before posting. 




 OK I see what you mean. Doing all that I guess you would need all that for the internet. 32 acres and not allowed a well? Are you gonna start a rain collection system or is that not allowed either? Love the idea of an outside shower, I want one too! I have property in Upstate New York and I'm really looking into putting something in there. Currently I'm trying to decide between a couple of shipping containers or a house on a goose neck trailer so I can hook up and travel with the wife. Do you know anybody who has traveled with their tiny house on a trailer and blogged about it? I know there's a few with converted school buses but I'm hoping someone has traveled with a tiny house on a trailer and let us know the good and the bad of doing something like that. Good luck and keep letting us know whats up. 




 Ok I checked your site and can truly appreciate all the time and effort you have put into tiny houses and from some one who is seriously interested in something like this thank you for all the info. I have a few questions if that's ok.   
If your house is on a trailer why do you need a graded road and a parking pad? Is that's because of your area? If you towed your house into your property and used jacks or whatever to solidify your home would the city know?   
Did you check for a well on your property or is that not allowed in your area. Your going solar, why not have a generator as back up and stay off the grid completely?   
Wouldn't a dish or a wi fi hot spot work just as well as a hook up through the city? Trust me on this because they are the only cable in town my brother and I get fucked every spring and summer by the huge cable bill so we keep it on for a few months a year just for that reason. 
Are you now going to have to put in a septic system? If your hooked up the the city's water are they not going to force you to install one? If you have running water are you going to use a composting toilet or have full running water then you will need a septic system, right?

 The guy was doing the neighbors wife a favor and was clearing the front of THEIR garage and some spray went that way. He was going between the car and the garage so he could only spray forward. Some guys are just crazy and with the talk about the cardboard in HIS recycle box I'm sure he knew something was coming.

 I'm seriously thinking of either a school bus conversion or a tiny house, that's why when ever I see something like this I stop to check it out. Most tiny houses use a lot of marine equipment intended for boats that are along these lines. i e propane fueled.

 Shipping containers were a perfect fit for these people https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D4WHT2F0JA. I really think you can get shipping containers for much cheaper than that. It depends where you are in relation to where the containers are. I'm seriously thinking of putting a couple of containers on some property in Upstate NY and the ones I've seen around here are around 3 grand each and another couple for shipping. Are you looking at new or used?  




 There is a wagon for that, it's a communal thing with the bathrooms. 




 It's too damm cold! 




 People who park in my driveway! Drives me insane. 




 NIce! I would be like got, got, want, want, got, want, want. I have to build a big book shelf this spring dammit! 




 Lucky Bastard. Much nicer than the nothing that I have now. I'm thinking of putting a smoker on my Brooklyn roof this year. Nice find. 




 Beautiful! Thanks but that's way to much money. 




 Sweet! That's why I love reddit. 




 As long as it tastes good who cares what it looks like. 




 Thanks this is why I love reddit. 




 Nice addition with the garlic butter! 




 If you want to get a solid roll of pepperoni and cut into small pieces and use that. The pre sliced kind will be to big and cause problems when you go to twist. 




 From what I understand he was making regular payments and was just late a couple of times and when he went to modify it she pressed charges when he moved and he was charged with a felony and lost his job. Until that moment he thought it was something he had not done in time and the charge was automatic. He then lost his job, spent time in jail and in that period of time accrued about 15,000 dollars in debt because of non payment, late fees and court costs all while he was in jail. She just wanted more money thinking just the threat of a felony would make him give her more money but once she pushed for it it became official and he went into the system. The woman who pointed that out even told the woman she went to far and now hes a felon and she's going to get a lot less money, see she was even trying to go after his unemployment. 




 Gently hold one end and twist twice then lay flat on baking sheet. Try making it once for yourself and see how it comes out. Add spices or hot sauce if you want more of a kick. :) 




 You could start with Pillsbury dough or just buy a ball of dough from your local pizzeria.

 I have been walking by this place my entire life, I live a couple of blocks away. I would go in and get some of their cookies from time to time. When they build the Verrazanno bridge they destroyed over 1550 homes and just gutted the Norwegian community in this area. I can remember the parades they would have  and how they would get smaller and smaller over the years. Sad.

 I DID karmadecay it! Nothing showed up so I posted it. I just checked again and now it shows up in ANOTHER subreddit and NOT the one you pointed out. What's wrong with karmaecay in that it does not show all of the same pics? 




 I posted the link in comments. 




 http://www.playboy.com/galleries/playmate-reunion-1979-pics/slide-47 I was actually surprised that I knew the names of some of the girls before I read them. Anybody else remember looking for the Playboys in the stacks of monthly magazines on the way to school, they were curved and all the others were straight. 




 I thought the same way and was looking forward to his movie Drive Hard when I came across it one night. I was shocked when I realized halfway through the movie the bad guy was John Cusack! I honestly wondered just what the directer or producer had on these guys to blackmail them into this terrible movie? 




 At least it's better than Mars who lowered the amount of their candy bars by 11% and then raised their prices

 Is This photoshopped? If it is it's done very well! 




 I was working a prom as a private bus driver for this group of rich Westchester kids who were having their prom at a fancy golf club when this kid behind me was bragging to his friends that it only took him intentionally wrecking the two new Mustangs his parents gave him for them to give him the BMW he wanted in the first place. He was showing them the pictures of the wrecks and the BMW keys to prove it. I never wanted to bitch slap somebody so bad before in my life! 




 Just how trashy does a post have to be?  A girl holding a six pack of Pabst Blue ribbon leaning on a fence in a bad neighborhood isn't trashy enough?

 It's a glass set, right? 




 I don't think so, it looks smaller than the stair treads. 




 I see you've had to cut away part of your curtains as well. We just used a sheet of paper towels and two paper clips to cover the hole and it works great. Now our ferocious guard cat can see who's at the door! 




 Check out his videos also, the guy is a great teacher as well as Gordon Ramsey's Cookery Show https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqztXdoBHvE fantastic series available 




 Check out Jacques Pepin's La Technique and La Method. I consider them in the top 10 cookbooks everyone should have. Amazon has his updated one for only a few bucks on kindle. 




 Pics or it didn't happen. 




 I bake a lot and we just came home from shopping. I got a dozen 4 cupcake hold boxes for .60 cents each and 4 mini quick bread pans with covers for .50 cents each from the container store in NYC. All 95% off so who cares if Santa is on the boxes? :) 




 Got it from here but no price. Does anyone have more info on this? Have one?
 




 Nice looking tiny house, I just love that stove with the copper http://www.tinyhouseliving.com/andrews-tiny-house/ 




 Come on ryan I posted this already. 




 It was just either in the washer or dryer from the load before.  




 One of the first things you are taught in culinary school is the term "Mise en Place" which means Things in it's place. Check this out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place.  As you go through a recipe have everything you need out and handy already. Do not be afraid to use small cups just like you see on the tv shows, that's the reason the Chef's can make the dish's they do look so easy. As you progress cooking more and more things will come so much more easy to you. Start to build up a knife kit, you do not have to go out and spend $300 on a full knife kit. Start small and buy quality products, knifes, pans spices and ingredients. Ask for a specific item for every birthday, Christmas, anniversary and Valentines Day and you would be amazed how fast you will get what you need. Good luck. 




 I would make one for a kids party but I think that's it. 




 Yes I see that now. I found the pic as I posted it. I also karmadecayed it and nothing showed up so I posted it. I just checked again http://karmadecay.com/results/u4531291.
