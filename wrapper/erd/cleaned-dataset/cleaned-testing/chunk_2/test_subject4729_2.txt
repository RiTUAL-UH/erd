 ^what he said. I'm sure he knows, he is just being a good boyfriend about. 




 when i saw the previews for the purge, I had already thought of who I'd kill, which was my wife's older sister. Its messed up a little bit but whatever, now that I think about I'd rather just scare the shit out of her with masks and guns. She is a stuck up pain in the ***. Always judging people and acting like she is the purest christian ever. She talks down to my wife and kids like her's are any better, she doesn't discipline her kids enough to the point they are actually respectful, but w/e. I just cant stand being around her when she starts talking about her self. I just want her to come down to earth and be less "douchey", then people wont hate her as much. I feel as though a purge would shake her up, make her think twice about being a total B****.

TL;DR wife's sister is a stuck up bi*** and at one point I wanted to kill her...have thought about it and came to the conclusion that she needs a wake up call.
