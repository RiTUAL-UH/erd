 Sherlock, Smaug and soon Doctor Strange. All tho I still need to see the Imitation game.  




 you realize its not coming out till march 2016 right? 









 Gone girl is good but not nightcrawler or whiplash good.  




 I know Im late to the party but my god that was amazing. It's easily tied for best picture along side Nightcrawler. Tho I still need to see other films like boyhood, raid 2 and imitation game but damn whiplash was incredible. That drum solo at the end. wow was that intense and every time J.K. Simmons came on screen my eyes were just immediately drawn to him, he has such an incredible presence its kinda scary and he just elevates everyone around him I mean Miles Teller as well that dude can act. Whiplash is easily in the top 5 movies of 2014.  




 I think sinister six will merge with amazing spider-man 3, that means sony can get one more movie out of Andrew Garfield and wrap up the trilogy properly. Then sell the rights back to marvel.  




 Awesome. i was looking forward to seeing this on the big screen again back when its original re release was cancelled. so Im looking forward to this. I saw ROTS 5 times when came out. Thought it was amazing then and I still do now. 









 The current generation haswell will be enough for a few more years at least even when the broadwell desktop parts come the performance increase wont be enough to warrant an upgrade it will be something silly like 5% IPC or some BS 




 I cant seem to find any games this morning and it says it cant retrieve my items from the inventory. Anyone else got this problem? 




 read his comment again, SLI doesn't always improve performance infact sometimes it can get worse because of how poorly optimized the SLI profile is for the particular game.  




 that's what im saying avoid $20 power supplies. they're cheap and are usually built with poor components. Thats what I meant by dont cheap out on the power supply.  




 you never want to cheap out on the power supply no matter how cheap your over all build is, one bad power supply and your pc could get fried.  




 Glorious set up brother! you should check ebay when you get more funds to get a nice cheap decent gpu.  









 From the announcement it doesnt sound like it.  




 have you tried playing the new game from telltale? its pretty damn good even if its just filler stuff.  









 wow, looking forward to playing the new pokemon on this.  




 I figured that since DA:I finally got cracked lords of the fallen would follow, but that doesnt seem to be the case. Anyone know if it will be cracked at all? 














 Got some left over christmas money to spend, wondering if I should pick this up. Is it good? 




 you might need a bios update. if I remember some amd bios were incompatible with some newer games.  




 So did The Dark Knight Rises, The way that whole plane sequence was shot was pretty incredible.  




 The Avengers. The way Loki makes his entrance is awesome.  














 Boyhood is also out in 720p 




 the year just started, have a little patience. Id be willing to wager that most of these if not all will be online by the end of the month.  









 we know it's sometime this month but do we have an actual date? 




 when did this trend start? was it for prometheus or before that? 




 They're filming this year however its not coming out till 2017. Why do they need an extra year and whats stopping it from making a 2016 release? seems a bit strange.  




 between now and the end of january is usually when it happens so fingers crossed.  




 it comes out in August thats more than a few months away but you are right. we should of had a teaser by now.  




 well at least I know a dvd screener is out their and hopefully it might leak! :D 




 Thing I hate the most is the awkward silence right after the trailers end and right before the movie starts everyone starts opening up their lollies and packets of chips and its like jeez. lol.  




 No. I hate eating during movies. I find it too distracting.  




 But what if the host doesnt want the baby from the start? why should she be forced to have it? its not fair on the child to be brought into a world where its not even wanted.  




 Completely agree with this.  




 this. plus No woman should be made to look after a child if she didnt want it from the start. I hate people that get all up tight about this subject about how if she didnt use protection then its her fault and she should keep the child but why should she if she never wanted it in the first place and it was a damn mistake?  




 I reckon seeing a live mammoth would of been pretty bad ass.
 




 Spiders,Snakes,Cockroaches. Seeing life sized versions of those would probably kill me lol.  




 When ever I tell someone online that I'm from New Zealand they go oh that's next to Australia right? Or Hey that's where Lord of the Rings was made. Usually its something along those lines. Why is this? Why do people seem to know nothing about my country?  









 I watched guardians of the galaxy for like the 10th time yesterday. 




 Im super pumped for it. Im all for anything to help fill the void while we wait for age of ultron and agents of shield to return.  




 Linux sux use a real OS like windows.  




 works for me so dont know about u guys.  




 I wont be getting my 970 till at least the end of February :( 




 They love teasing us :( 




 just buy a physical copy then? 









 Rockstar said they would be released in a couple of a weeks back in late December. So where are the system requirements? 




 did you even read the article? its for the half life 1 remake black mesa announcing its full release.  




 I totally forgot this game even existed.  




 just go to any pc vs console video and be amazed.  









 Thats never been confirmed outside of the leaked emails from November. Things could of changed since then.  









 Off the top of my head, this one from Iron Man 3 comes to mind https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv2bGsdizhM so bad lol. 




 Time Gem in Ant-Man and Soul Gem in Doctor Strange.  




 I pray to the marvel gods that they get spiderman back! pls sony just give up, make some sort of statement to the fans about wanting spiderman to have a better future, admit you made mistakes and move on.  




 Yus!!! hopefully this trailer is more story focused than the last couple.  




 Never seen the original Mad Max before and with the sequel coming out I was thinking I should watch it. Just wondering how does it hold it up today? Do I need to watch it or can I go into fury road blind with no knowledge of the original? 




 yea i was gonna say wtf man, taking your computer and tv sure thats what burglars do but to steal a mans bed? fuck your asking for trouble now son. A man needs his beauty sleep. 




 they never said it was half done filming. it never even made it to principal photography. But it was well into development. They were probably a couple of months away from filming when it was cancelled.  














 Draco Malfoy from the HP series.  




 i gave u an up vote because you were unfairly down voted. I want winter soldier or DOFP to be nominated for best picture so then the Comic book movie genre will be taken more seriously. I dont think a comic book movie has been nominated since the dark knight. the winter soldier and DOFP both deserve recognition for best picture. Ill probably get down voted for saying this but its true.  




 'All this hype. WHat if it turns out it was cut for a reason' You have to wonder how much rogue they actually filmed and decided to cut if their able to release another version based on Rogue. Im really curious to see it.  




 I watched this again for the first time in like 5 years, still cracks me up every time. Its one of the few comedies that legitimately get me laughing. what did you guys think of the movie? 









 65c isnt bad. That should not be causing a shutdown. whats the max temp for the 8320? i thought it would be like 90c max or something? 




 Im really interested to see how he pulled off the awesome Joker voice. Are there any documentaries or behind the scenes stuff that show how he did it?  









 Yup, no idea what the specs are tho its from 2005.  




 yea thought it might of been ebay. bad luck bro. always go to a decent company like Ibuypower or cyberpowerpc for prebuilts.  









 thats why i always check the channel directly. youtubes feed is shit period. it never seems to work for me.  




 just because someone has an AMD cpu or graphics card doesnt make them any less a part of the master race than you me or anyone else and I think a lot of you seem to forget that. Quite often ill see someone get down voted because they have an AMD rig. I want to know why is AMD thought off so negatively here on this subreddit?  




 This one? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRd-CeWzZrs 




 i hope your right bro, id love it if we got the master chief collection and the gears of war games. Hell id be happy with those. but any future titles we get id consider a bonus. ms please all i want at least is halo and gears! 




 yea they do. Some of us actually liked titan fall and despite already owning destiny on ps4 I want it on PC for the superior visuals and just over all better experience.  




 id say its pretty much confirmed now. There were rumors like this with GTA V on pc right up until it was confirmed. All we need to do is a wait for bungie to confirm it, probably early next year. I have yet to finish destiny on ps4 so I may actually wait and play it on pc with a controller.  









 Snape in Harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2. 




 With only a few days left of the sale its currently at $13.74. Should I buy it now or wait till the last day just to make sure it doesnt get cheaper? 




 summer 2015 maybe? im just guessing.  




 probably less than 500w. A long the lines of the 970/980.  




 'The game I turned my consoles on for the most this year' hahaha well played totalbiscuit.  




 seriously? IMDB is trash. At least the forums are. I never found IMDB reliable at all.  




 And Andrew Bond? Can anyone explain? was Bonds father named Andrew? 




 A lot of people seem rather one sided about this, some think its cap others think its stark. I think its captain america. A large portion of the movie focuses on him and his back story. Though I can see why others would say its Stark.  




 Peter Jackson's King Kong? 




 I know what you mean OP! Im having trouble keeping my ambient room temperature down because of how tiny my room is. As soon as I shut my bedroom door my cpu temp rises because my ambient temp rises which pisses me off. So I have to keep my door open until I can afford a fan off sorts. 




 I5. better performance and a better upgrade path. 









 imagine if the harry potter movies were made now,Benedict Cumberbatch would of played voldemort.  









 I was just wondering about this because I remember before it was announced that Norton wasn't returning I remember reading heaps of rumors how the hulk was going to be tbe villain in the avengers and team was going to have to hunt him down because of how out of control he was getting, this was of course before Norton left the role. Did anyone else hear any similar rumors regarding the hulk in the avengers before Norton left? 




 Did someone order a pizz...I mean monitor xD 




 nice build. eventually you can upgrade to an i3 or i5.  




 I gagged while looking at this.  




 because the characters surrounding her a more interesting. you know your show is bad when your main character is less interesting than your supporting characters.  




 we are getting phantom pain next year so dont worry :) 




 you aint getting any karma from me son. Controllers are perfectly fine for FPS. 




 Because this game looks awesome. I'm sure a lot of people outside of korea want to play it. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/2m66gt/lost_ark_the_new_korean_hack_and_slash/ 




 did you flick the switch on at the back? 




 Intel. I used to be all pro amd but once you go Intel you can never go back.  




 lol i bet if you showed him the controllers working on your pc he would of said its fake even if you were playing a game right in front of him. sounds like hes one of those guys who searches for a movie trailer and calls it fake when its not lol.  




 I dont see anything wrong with it? don't act ungrateful.  




 TAG THIS MOFO! NSFMR!!! 




 This the exact upgrade I hope to make next year. I'm running a 660 myself. its a great card.  




 so does it still work? 




 thats kind of creepy.  




 Has anyone actually been able to see this yet? I heard finding a screening is like finding a needle in a haystack?  




 Thats fuckin amazing! its like an Frankenstein pc lol 




 yep your all good :) 




 you can play it just fine. those sites are highly inaccurate.  




 Thats not a bad rig, honestly you could just upgrade to a gtx 970 and you would be sweet. you might get a tiny bit of a bottle neck with that cpu but it would barely be noticeable.  




 I think this has to stop guys I mean look at this post http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/2qei24/my_brother_has_become_a_peasant_today/

The guy makes fun of his brother because he got an xbox one for Christmas I mean isnt that taking it a bit too far? using it to insult someone? Its not a joke any more and especially during christmas calling someone a console peasant out side of this sub who has no idea what it means is rather insulting and vulgar. Anyone else agree? I hope the mods will at least consider it because Im sick and tired of seeing thie term used now and quite frankly its embarrassing.  




 Nice! Hope the build goes well :) 




 So I just noticed this just now, as soon as I open /r/pcmasterrace my temps spike from around 35-36C to about 45C and go back to 35-36C as soon as I close it. Is it because of the snow animation at the top thats causing the High cpu usage? anyone else getting this? this happens in both chrome and firefox. any other web page is fine.  




 I have a debit card so i'm just gonna deposit it straight in to my bank account. :) 









 just wondering, how do you know it was stolen? i know you said you saw the delivery guys coming down the street but how do you know it wast stolen did a neighbor or friend notify you? 














 correct. Broadwell will use LGA1150 the same socket as the current Haswell but Skylake which was mentioned above will use a new socket.  




 aye? i thought it was broadwell? only the mobile parts of broadwell are out we are still waiting for the desktop parts.  




 The next wave of Intel cpus is Broadwell which still uses LGA1150. however they are not due out till sometime next year. As far as im aware it wont be much of an upgrade over haswell unless someone can correct me? id stick with Haswell in a new build.  




 aye, its not free.  




 even worse now that rocket has basically left development to open up a new studio and start working on another game. you know its bad when the creator leaves and doesn't even want to finish his product.  




 and yet that guy spent over 200 hours playing it. obvious troll is obvious.  




 wot? 




 I'm among the few who enjoyed the first amazing spiderman but I havent even been able to get through the 2nd one yet. Its that bad. And I dont think its all of reddit, it just seems like that cause of how often its posted.  




 it says that all 10 of DCs upcoming movies are part of the same universe meaning that includes Shazam. This is coming directly from an official source now so there is no doubt this time.  




 the lord of the rings references lmao.  




 its possible the gameplay despite being from the pc version is that its running on a ps4 devkit which is essentially a pc with the same specs as a retail console.  




 aye inquisition is awesome. 




 I cant read any of what your friend added. 









 the New 3DS clearly states it doesnt come with a charger .its stupid I know. But this info has been known for a while now.  




 its ether FC4 or The Crew. Dont even bother with unity.  









 Even with that clarification he still doesnt sound too keen on the crossover happening.  




 Now that hes free from Ant-Man do we know if he has anything in the pipeline?  




 if it was a publicity stunt then why only give the movie in a limited release? seems like they are still taking the terrorist threats somewhat serious.  




 Nothing is gonna happen. its a bunch of fake wannabe terrorists trying to act tough behind a keyboard.  




 the 270x requires a 500w power supply so yours is more than enough. Its possible the power supply is on its way out and the timing is a just coincidence that it started happening when you put in your new 270x. perhaps put in your old 7850 and see if it still happens. if it doesnt happen then maybe its an issue with your 270x. what make and model is your power supply ?  




 This one?

 so no 950ti? seems like the 950ti would work really well on the new architecture.  




 how is he biased? he still uses intel in most of his rigs.  




 i have the entire collection on origin. its glorious.  




 already been posted.  









 Navy seals? aye more like ninjas lol.  




 thats a 970? huh it looked so small i thought it was a 750ti.  




 some people dont have time or just cant be bothered.  




 its back man.  




 its back! 




 the end of the world? 




 Your worrying too much, it will be fine. Some sites take a bit longer to update their shipping status.  




 Dam it! 









 wtf, i seriously hope your joking. your in some serious shit other wise.  




 you've probably bumped a cable loose some where, check they're all properly connected to the motherboard.  




 no begging.  




 we have them in EB games in Auckland.  




 Ive got a spare copy of half life 2 in my inventory and have been wanting to get cod 4 for a while now. Anyone want to trade? ill gift it to the person and then they can gift me?

proof http://imgur.com/cwQsHvX 




 Just play games bro, i dont upgrade until i find a game i cant play.  




 So im trying to mod skyrim, But for some reason none of them are working and i have a feeling its because they're not in the right order. I heard some mods have to be specifically placed before or after other mods but i have no idea what i should be doing here. Any idea what order these should be in?

 Cry moar bitch.  




 For those wondering what im talking about, its when Linus pulls on the heat sink and its just dangling in the air.  









 im down for that! 




 This could actually be awesome. Imagine the crew of the enterprise pulling off an awesome space heist!  




 i think its creepy how much she looks like Brody.  




 because its so damn creepy how much she looks like Brody! 




 yea thats what i thought, I thought they might of aired the wrong episode because when Carrie and Dar are talking at the start i was like aye, did I miss something? this episode felt so out of place.  




 those episodes were golden compared to this crap we got.  




 got a source for this? 




 strange, i played this game for over 20 hours and never had an issue.  









 same, wish they would put Quinn and Saul in charge. would be so much better.  




 Anyone else get the feeing that there will be less Carrie and more Quinn and Saul next season?  Carrie basically doesnt have any reason to be on the show any more. Quinn is off doing his own missions and Saul looks like hes back at the CIA. Id love it if season 5 was Quinn and Saul doing mission together. Quite frankly I think Carrie's story has run its course, she said good bye to Quinn they no their relationship will never work. Quinn made that obviously clear when he left. I'm sure Carrie will still feature next season but hopefully as more of a supporting character, I really think she needs to take the backseat for a while and let the others shine. just my 2 cents.  




 Its fake. There are no legit torrents for the movie yet.  









 Here's a small recap trailer I found, it still missed out heaps of stuff but it covers the basic plot. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6V__oXbHeg 









 So in all his interviews recently, I don't know who keeps bringing it up whether its him or his interviewers but he keeps mentioning how he doesn't want people to think of guardians of the galaxy as an infinity war prequel and how he doesn't seem to fond of the guardians crossing over with the avengers and it all makes him sound rather arrogant imo because its not his decision to make where the guardians are placed in the MCU.

Now in all fairness I can understand that he wants guardians to stand on its own but guardians is part of the MCU that's never going to happen and its inevitable they will meet the avengers one way or another with or without Gunn. 

It seems to me that perhaps Gunn doesn't like where the MCU is going and Feige's vision as a whole since he even complained recently about writing Thanos in to guardians and how much trouble it was and how it was a plot that was just serving the avengers and didnt really add anything for the guardians and he doesnt want guardians to serve the avengers which again I can understand but its not his decision to make.  

Kevin Feige has a master plan hes the quiet puppet master who is pulling the strings behind the scenes and it seems like Gunn isn't too keen on following his vision. Not sure if its just me but that's the vibe im getting he wants guardians to stand on their own just how Edgar Wright wanted Antman to be standalone but that obviously wasn't going to happen and he had to be let go. 

It looks like Gunn might be in a similar position and hes starting to get rather vocal about his opinions (Which I think is good) but I hope he sits down and seriously thinks about what hes been saying before he gets in trouble with the higher ups at Marvel and Disney. 

We all know Marvel isn't afraid to change directors. I think what it comes down to is can Gunn and Feige come to a neutral agreement on who has the most control because it sounds like Gunn wants more control than he actually has. I'm only speculating here and more than likely Gunn is just messing with us and behind the scenes hes completely on board with the avengers and guardians crossing over (I hope anyway) however If worst comes to worst they may change director again and thats the last thing I want. Thats just my opinion though.   




 The PC isnt part of any generation. Its one constant platform. Its always changing.  You cant define it by a generation.  









 That's pretty cool. People hate on Microsoft for their lack of pc gaming support but this proves that at least someone at microsoft does care . 




 the best deals are usually on the last day. 




 This is an old article sony have said they are looking at different ways to release the movie sometime in the future. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-30559169
