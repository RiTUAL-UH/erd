 From what I've seen mostly. The only limitation is the size of the room, which would get better with tech (going to be using the new alpha Kinect with it soon since that can see further).  




 The reason I ask this is because most definitions of it define it as simply a room you can interact within (usually with holograms, though other demos use similar tech as this) and also label themselves as holodecks, so if there's some part I missed, do feel free to say.  




 Maybe I'm missing something then, what exactly do you qualify as a holodeck? 









 Essentially the idea would be to create a penetration testing group (hacking team) and follow them around with a camera on whatever jobs they get for companies.  I did a really in-depth description about this on my blog, so feel free to read about it more in depth here: http://gemisis.blogspot.com/2014/04/hack-it-tv-show-idea.html

This was just one of the crazy ideas I dreamt up while attempting to sleep one night (Why must the mind do this??? XD) 




 Being able to do a ton of them in bulk with a cup was what I was pointing out.  It'll let you make a dozen of them without having to wait for them to all cool individually. 














 I honestly don't really think any current AAA developers will take advantage of VR best.  I think we may see new AAA developers popup as a result of VR honestly, assuming that VR takes off this time around.
