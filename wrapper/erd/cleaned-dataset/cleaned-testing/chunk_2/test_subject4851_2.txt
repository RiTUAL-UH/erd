 Why 'your family'. What about the rest of us? Aren't we your family too? What, you don't love us anymore? :'( 




 Why do we need to state this? I can't think of anyone in their right senses who'd want to stop people from having those adorable ornaments 




 For shame! 




 I think this is a cultural thing. Like having a sense of style. 




 I think it's more something like this http://previews.123rf.com/images/gmast3r/gmast3r1203/gmast3r120300078/12769460-handsome-young-business-man-serious-hands-on-waist.jpg 




 Clearly you have put sins thought to this. I guess they will be color coded too?  




 The push intensifies. 









 I don't think that counts as unison anymore..... 




 Why is anyone interested in reading about and hearing the misguided  thoughts of scum?
Be careful what you feed your mind... 




 I think it's how she really sees you. 




 Me three 




 But the tax payer still bears the burden. Which in and of itself isn't a problem. It is the inflated costs dictated by insurance companies that is the problem.
 




 Who is this government you speak of. What you are really saying here, and cleverly trying to conceal, is that Americans are incompetent. Is there a transformation that goes on between private and public sector? Are 'Americans' in private sector a different species than the ones working in the public sector? 
Your argument makes no sense. A system is efficient if it is well funded and managed. When these services are subject to the whims of ideologues, then you have a problem.
How about the banking sector? Can you point me to a government fail even remotely close to the epic fail we witnessed in the banking sector recently? The government may be slow and inefficient, but you can be guaranteed that they are not in it to inflate their personal bank accounts... 




 Actually, they only have mastery over one very very specific thing. But, to obtain such mastery comes the ability to understand many things very quickly. So to Op is basically saying sacrifice verbosity and give a condensed (usually complex) answer, which I can ruminate over. 




 That was decades ago. You're living in it! 




 What did the Dutch ever do to you? 




 The lethargy of all things Nigerian government, characteristic of the outgoing 'lame duck' president of Nigeria (Goodluck Jonathan), seems to wane as the country approaches a monumental political transition. This erstwhile attitude is giving way to a more accountable, disciplined, and responsible attitude, which coincidentally are a hallmark of the incoming president elect, Gen Muhammadu Buhari (rtd). The recent military campaigns have successfully rescued victims of Boko Haram by the hundreds. However, there is much needed help and support from the local and international community. These women and children have been systematically traumatized through rape and torture for years. Much psychological, physical, and economic help and support is needed. Please lend your support through positive thoughts, words, and deeds in form of kind or cash.
~ thank you.

 I see what you did there... 




 Bad feels like a very very deficient description for the sheer nonsense that is the w540 track pad. 




 Learn how to 'read a book'. What flag patch!? 




 First, pointing me to a website is not proof of anything. What was the sample size, is this a global statistic or a study based on subjects in the United States (who are known for their healthy lifestyle).

Second and more importantly, your rebuttal dies not refute anything of what I have stated. You could say, 100% of all births result in death of the individual concerned. What does that actually mean?

My comment stands valid nonetheless. A pregnancy will run its course to its inevitable end. The natural result of which is a birth. Unless you are going to argue that the natural end of a pregnancy is something other than birth, for which you will need to cite something more credible than an internet website. 




 Your logic comparing abortion to organ donation is deeply flawed. One requires an active action or intervention while the other does not. An organ donation is an active intervention and a choice. Do nothing and the person dies. The choice part of a pregnancy is naturally only in the act of procreating. But being pregnant, doing nothing and making no choice, results in something inevitable: birth. You are warping things to fit in with your reasoning, which isn't how logic works.. 




 You mean it turned out not to fit with the hitherto prevailing religious understanding of God. You all who created God yet you are satisfied with finding forces, the origin of which you haven't bothered to ask. 

Perhaps if you think of Him as the Origin, the Source, the Beginning then you a question such as  'who created Him' becomes a wrong question. 

Nothing exists that was not created. Understanding the price behind the creation, which is very different from religious concoctions, does not disproves anything. It only proves that religion was wrong. 




 Your comment is every evidence of how that you have nothing to offer. Now hurry along and be on your way little man. 




 Wow. That's sad. Mine held fine. I did the OTA update to 5.01 a few days ago. And thankfully, it installed successfully. I will be the last to do the next update.
I'm actually contemplating samsung or apple as my next phone... 




 What can or should the average citizen do to make this overturn happen? I've given money, shared links, discussed with friends. Who do we write? What can we do to push this? 




 I forgot to say thanks for the simple, clear, unmuddled description of how you fixed your system! Thank you! 




 I'm not sure I understand what is going on with Google. I am going to demand a refund for my phone since it is still within manufacture warranty. 
How on earth does a company that big release a full operating system that bricks their flagship device. This is an EPIC FAIL! 




 So much color. beautiful. 




 Very interesting. Most people who are stuck on the bible fail to understand the meaning of circular logic. 
How do you convince someone that something is wrong or incorrect or illogical if there is no basis for their belief? Nothing objective to pivot off of. Can you see how this is a self inflicted curse that is almost impossible to break?

Most people are of the opinion that God must be illogical, supernatural and all manner of ignorant ideas.
Quite to the contrary, I think that God is perfectly logical, and a perfection of what we consider natural. If one understands that His Will are expressed in the laws of nature (a small subset of which is recognized by the sciences, ... of which more are recognized daily). 




 Aye cap'n

 I have offered you no old book. In fact, i have offered you no book at all.
1. What part of anything I have written indicates that I have, or ever will, offer you an old book? And I am assuming you are referring to the bible here? right?
2. If you are interested in finding something, I suggest you go look for it. Waiting for someone to offer you something is arrogant and assumes that your acceptance of it is somewhat precious or worth the trouble in even the smallest way. Which it is not, that much I can guarantee you.
3. I will refrain from sounding rude here, but from your comment it is clear you haven't a clue what you purport to be: "an atheist is one who lacks religion." Try "disbelief or lack of belief in the existence of God or gods." And if you aren't aware, that belief or disbelief in itself lacks any proof or evidence. So it is a collection of people who share the same baseless belief or 'faith'. That too is a religion, or sect, or cult, or whatever.
You don't have to accept this, I can tell you what you are from your writing. You appear to be one who is either agnostic or just is. You don't have to be anything really. Just what you are, and that is a human being.

My comments on gravity and the natural laws hold nothing of mythical or 'old book' flavor as they are things we see and experience daily. My conclusions that we are subject to these laws and whether or not they have a source, are my personal conclusions. And nothing to do with religion, sects, cults, or schools of belief or the like.

My way, religion, the word, or anything bearing and semblance to organized or group thinking will be abolished and made illegal. Then all will be forced to reason and think freely for themselves.

My logic is not meant to persuade. Persuasion is immaterial and futile. It is internal. Only you can reflect for yourself and come to a conclusion. This will never come from outside. And if it does, then you are a drone. Similar to ISIS, Christians, and other religious fanatics who have been told and are convinced they act in service of some god that wants them to kill and torture others. I offer pictures of things you can assess for yourself and persuade yourself to this or that conclusion. That is all.
