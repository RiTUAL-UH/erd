    WE MUST GO AN TAKE 4CHAN BACK FROM LE TUMBLR AND 9GAGGERS! 




 What is the most powerful at compositing yet is pretty cheap? 




 Does anyone else think so?
 




   Need some assistence with this one, it's too specific for google maps and the question is unclear by what it is expecting by landforms. 




 Plasterbrain - NimbassaCore

Requiem for A Tower

Darude- Sandstorm of course 




 In the suburban city of McAllen, TX! 




 I bark and eat everything. 




 Woof. 



















 Serious. 




 Ill start: 
*blowgun
*bow 




 Saving Private Ryan of course 









   Would they have had the brains to do it? 




   Is the pricing flexible?

Can plugins like Element 3d work with it?
 
How hard is it to learn?

What are it's advantages over Adobe's After Effects? 




  Put the price difference aside. 
Let's focus on the technical advantages and disasvantages of each. 




   Would the homo erectus, neandertal or the denisovan been able to use the bow and arrow? 




  I'll start.

1.Things exploding that would never explode in real life. 




  Maybe a campaign to launch an ad on reddit? 









   Take the Tumblr-4chan Flame Wars of Independence day. A series of ddos attacks occured. But no arrests were made. Why? 




 4chan actually made me shed tears... 




 Link? 




  It's a seems like a really good software to start film-making.  









   A good code injector is needed.
 It doesn't have to be, but specifically one where code modifications can be made directly from the jailbroken phone.  














   Could be used like a war elephant I guess. I had this question when I was a wee lad and decided to post it. 









   Stupid question. It's quite a long story.  




 How do you fall for that? 




   They were pretty intelligent. They knew about projectiles.
We know that most likely none of them ever built or shot one.
 But if we put all of that aside, did Neanderthals have the intelligence and physical capacity to build and shoot a bow and arrow? 




 Just wondering. 




   Now don't get me wrong, there economic system was great. There was no such thing as poor in their society. They also were very good at making remedies for injuries and diseases and were skilled warriors. They survived against all odds. Now, I did't come here to argue over who is more developed. 
  I'm just wondering why was it that Europeans had gunpowder, more advanced science, advanced corporations and armies. They also had ships that could cross entire oceans and some of the Europeans had mastered the art of Gliding (People like Otto Lilienthal). 
 Why is it that they were technologically superior the the natives? 




  I would've preferred it if it was a 3d puzzle game. Something like Super Mario 64. 
 Pretty good visuals too. 




 It seems like it would be pretty chaotic. With the eruption of Toba and the impending Ice Ages. 
  Similar skirmishes probably happened when Homo Erectus, Neanderthal, and Sapien existed together 80,000 to 100,000 years ago.
  Homo Sapiens had the evolutionary advantage. They crafted bow and arrows, which were devastating weapons back then. 




  It's not saying there was a prehistoric LOTR style war between species, 
I'm just saying it is theorized that humans fought Neanderthals which might have helped killed them off. 
  
 




   My favorite theory for the Neanderthal demise is the one where it is thought that humans helped drive the Neanderthals to extinction. Some sort of inter species war. A battle for resources and land.

  It fascinates me. What does R/ anthropology think? 




 P.s. How do you add location? 




  The video explains the dilemma.

 Can PETA really threaten them? What have they done wrong?

 




   Is it illegal to use someones picture like that? I've also seen instances where faces from google images have been used as fake suicide victims.
