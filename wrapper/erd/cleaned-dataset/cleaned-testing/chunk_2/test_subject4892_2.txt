 Haters downvote. But PJIII will rise. 




 I love Barnes. But Curry, Thompson, and Lee are all solid scoring options already. I just can't see him having a big enough role to win ROY. 




 The bobcats have such a lack of scorers in place right now though. I could see him going 15/6/5 on 41% shooting and making a serious run at ROY. I think that'd be his best case scenario. 




 I think one pertinent detail people aren't mentioning: they're giving him a statue because Joe Pa has been the coach at Penn State for 45 years and has won more college football games than any coach in Division 1 history. The man is an absolute legend in his own right.  




 It's not. But it's not replacing commercial breaks, it's in addition to them. 




 It's really difficult to get an idea how good his game is going to translate to the NBA. 90% of those highlights were the result of hilariously bad defenses that he'll never see (unless he's playing Andre Blatche) here. He definitely has unquestionable athleticism, but I think he's going to have some growing pains while he starts to figure out how NBA centers work, and I expect him to have a *much* better 2nd half of his rookie season than first. 




 1. Yes

2. A company whose owner gives money to groups that take an anti-gay rights stance =/= corporate discrimination. 




 Crim pro is easily the most "that's some serious bullshit" class of the 22 I've taken so far. Some of the analysis the justices use is so far removed from reality it's hilarious. 




 Overall not a talented scorer by any stretch, extremely poor free throw shooter, passing skills prowess is inflated (via his assist numbers) because he plays with the big-3 as opposed to, say, Deron's situation in NJ last year.

I don't necessarily agree with those arguments. But those are usually what's brought up. 




 Close. A digital short. 




 Yep. Anthony Randolph once score 42 points in a summer league game. 




 final fantasy VII? 




 Also, we already used our amnesty on gilbert arenas. 




 I still wear my Shaq and Penny jerseys from time to time. I'll probably buy a Howard one real cheap soon. 




 No true Knicks fan. 




 Nah, Wall still has a lot of potential. 




 I'm confused. When were Gwyneth Paltrow and Tom Cruise ever married? 




 The thing about law school: with a couple specific exceptions, nothing you learn is really that difficult. But the pure volume of material you learn, as well as the nature of law school exams make it incredibly rigorous and testing. So it's still hard, but it's not exactly going to ever stretch the bounds of your cognitive faculties. 




 Not really, no. Starting with the market crash in 2008, the legal hiring market didn't see a downturn; it saw a complete structural collapse. 




 You just said you had a job waiting for you. "connections and networking" got you 100% of the way already. 




 Egregious Texas trolling. We all know it's top-14. 




 It's funny that, as a Magic fan who has slowly given up on Dwight being a part of our team's future, i've had the exact opposite reaction progression. 




 What on God's green earth just happened? 




 And even then, I think the Wolves are the first team to replace anyone who falls out. And even if two teams fall out, suggesting Curry, Bogut, and Davis Lee are going to stay healthy is an extraordinary suspension of belief. 




 *In 1992*

1. Magic was already retired, and was becoming a serious defensive liability for the Lakers leading up to that point. Chris Paul today is probably the best defensive point guard in the NBA, and overall he's absolutely better than 1992 Magic

2. Scotty Pippen v. Kevin Durant  is impossible to say conclusively in either direction. Durant is plausibly the best pure scorer in the NBA right now, but Scotty Pippen was much better defensively.

3. Larry Bird's back was going out by '92, he was a significantly worse player that year than Westbrook was this year. 

4. I wouldn't call Stockton a better player than Deron; Stockton's legacy comes more from his insane durability and his incredible passing skills, but outside of that he was very one dimensional. Deron is a much better defender (read: average) and is a much more capable scorer as well.

Edit: after going back and looking at Stockton, I'm definitely wrong about him, so nevermind on point 4. 




 That doesn't even make any sense. 




 1. Ryan Anderson is not small... he has the same height/wingspan as Kevin Love.

2. His defensive rebound numbers were low because Dwight is a defensive rebound vacuum.

3. He had 3.7 offensive rebounds a game last year, 5th most in the entire NBA.

4. Why are you talking about Ibaka? They're very differently built players. 




 LOL at CP3 going back to the Hornets. 




 Ummm, you know the Heat *just* won the championship, right? 




 Well... shit. He was like our one good rebuilding piece.  




 Cool bigotry bro. 




 That means she doesn't like you bro. 




 Yes. And the whole "I showed up knowing like *nothing* and totally got an A in that class" shtick was fun during undergrad, but in law school bragging about your academic achievement feels incredibly conceited.

Also, why did you even post this in the lawschool sub? 




 Are you... in law school? 




 A view that correlates with a party's base is not the same thing as an ideological tenet of the party. 




 Yep. Howard has had *no* character problems his first six years (unless you count "being too happy" a character problem). Every negative thing he's done has revolved around his crappy situation with the Orlando Magic management; and I don't entirely blame him, even though he could have handled it much much better. His actual locker room attitude is a non-issue. 




 Can I ask what area of work you're in? 




 There isn't one. 




 It absolutely does n... right, username. 




 Really? I shake my head at reddit's hilariously uninformed opinions getting massive upvotes on a daily basis.

Well... to be fair it's always in r/politics 




 Hey. This guy is against America! Downvote him! 




 I would definitely make two part movie of final fantasy VII. The first one would end right after [game spoiler alert] Aerith's death. I'd probably have to cut out certain events, like most of the more minuscule parts of the journey through the midgar sectors, probably Yuffie/Wutai altogether, and the Cloudless hunts for the huge materia.

Peter Jackson would direct it, because the Lord Of The Rings style of epic is the only way this film could be pulled off. Jeremy Renner would be cast as cloud, Kristen Stewart would be Aerith, Chris Hemsworth as Sephiroth, Carey Mulligan as Tifa, Colin Farrell would be Vincent Valentine, Bryan Cranston as professor Hojo, Brendan Gleeson as the voice of Cait Sith (he's supposed to have an accent), John Hamm as the voice of Red XII, Terry Crews as Barret Wallace, and Bruce Willis as Cid Highwind.

The movie would definitely have 5-6 incredibly surreal Kubrickian long-shots, including the destruction of sector 7, the journey down the northern crater, the flashbacks to nibelhelm and Cloud/Tifa's descent into the lifestream.

This will never happen though :( 




 It goes to a blank page. 




 I love how you're getting downvoted by people who haven't seen Platoon or Wall Street. 




 Creepy is kindof a "you know it when you see it" test. Every action you listed as creepy I could do without coming off as creepy, and every action you listed as not-creepy I could make into an extremely creepy encounter. 




 That's definitely not her. 




 Schindler's List- the girl with the red coat. 




 People still post on that website? 




 Downvote all trolling in truereddit. 




 No. CP3 is worlds ahead of him, Derrick Rose is clearly above him, and I don't think there's a winning argument for him over Deron or Tony Parker.

Yeah, he rocked the playoffs. He deserves props for that, but the guy has a true shooting % of .48 and an incredibly high turnover rate. That's an insurmountable set of flaws if you're trying to go for "best pg in the world." 




 How could you be 19 and graduated from college already? 




 Yep, I've been to one in Estes Park. 




 100 x100 is only 10k, not 100k. But somehow your end result came out correct. 




 People don't hide it because they think it's wrong, but because it's inappropriate for most non-private contexts and potentially embarrassing for most people. You mean to tell me you'd be completely okay with a cute girl borrowing your computer and having it correct to youjizz? 




 What Is Reformed Theology- R.C. Sproul

excellent entre that breaks down the fundamentals of the theological system. 




 She's just in a bad mood because her boyfriend forgot her birthday, and to make up for it he made her a card full of memes. 




 Final fantasy VI:

Terra with the 128% MBlock set-up

Mog with Pearl Lance/Dragoon Boots/Dragon Horn

Gau with the Wind God setup; doubling as a physical damage tank.

Edgar Imped



FFVII: 

Cloud

Yuffie- because I love her date scene, and she's the coolest character

RedXIII- because nobody ever gives him any love. 




 I still have so much to learn :( 




 It's starting to shock me (in a good way) how much effort and quality posters are starting to put into novelty accounts.

That was an awesome song. 




 You would have to be incredibly over-levelled to fight them to begin with. 




 Quick refresher in terms of beliefs: Presbyterians generally believe in reformed theology, which is largely based in [these five points](http://calvinistcorner.com/tulip), that were established above and beyond Luthor's theological break from Catholicism, whereas Methodists, whose theology comes from the reflections of John Wesley (who founded Methodism more as a way of life, trying to be "methodical" about living holy) rejected those views and embraced [Arminianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminianism) which is essentially an exact opposite stance all five points previously mentioned. That's how those two differ, anyways. 




 Ew, rage comics. 




 No true Boston fan. 




 Yep, this girl is actually pretty hilarious in pulling it off so well; and was clearly some joke that she decided to make a video out of. It's a shame reddit will largely never understand this. 




 I love that you use reasonable suspicion and probable cause interchangeably without knowing which one is needed (or whether an arrest warrant is needed, or whether there's some warrant exception needed) to arrest someone. Way to make a judgment without even knowing what the standard is. 




 Fredette was 10th...

It's legit guys. 




 That's awesome. Was there a guide of some kind you used to get there? 




 It's not an exemption, just a separate taxable rate. 




 I live in Atlanta. Here it is not. 




 Ugh. This exact moment has prevented me from my lifelong goal of a lvl 1 Excalibur II walkthrough. I hate you (with adulation). 




 Yep. Florida is a great state. And I'd imagine that, controlled for socioeconomic factors, it's about as intelligent as most of the rest of the country (I hold reservations for the Northeast and the West). It's just a great target to knock on. 




 They don't think it be that bad. But it do. 




 Check your sidebar. 




 No, seriously, what the fuck reddit. You've been bitching nonstop since this site was creating about how our due process rights are eroding, how the death penalty is simply wrong (regardless of the level of doubt). And now that people are killing endangered animals instead of humans *you're completely okay with it.*

Shitty hypocrisy is shitty. 




 Prelaw doesn't qualify you for shit either. You need 3 years of law school after that before you're able to take the bar, and you can go to law school from any undergrad degree, so it's not comparable to premed.
 




   I really don't know where to turn to or what even to search.

Getting recommendations for a lawyer would be a great place to start 









 For me personally, I enjoyed the simplicity. I think a lot of times when videogames try and put a complex moral framework around a villain they often fail and it's usually a criticism of the game. FFVI didn't even try; they just went for pure, simple, evil. It's a breath of fresh air.

Not only is abnormal for a villain to be so straight-forwardly evil, but he actually succeeds too. He destroys the world of balance. Those two factors make for a very unique and wonderful villain. 




 What? I was attacking his vague use of "legal loopholes," not the numbers themselves.

He also said "over the past 10 years." So your graph is completely worthless, because the highest marginal rate has been at 35% for 10 years now. 




 The capital gains tax rate isn't a loophole. 




 Not really though. 




 8% geometric return is a complete fantasy land.  




 Just briefly looked up his post history. One of the most curious posting styles I've ever seen in my life. 




 Weird, I've been told i'm "stand offish" and "the guy who doesn't like anybody" 




 At stanford though? 




 Yep. Ignoring is the greatest weapon. 




  Now, as a white male, I feel as if I'm attacked by a black man, I can't defend myself as I'll get screwed legally even in the right.

Calling paranoid parrot. 




 Reading comprehension. We're talking about consistency amongst manuscripts; not the occurrence of the events themselves. 




 Wait... what??? Fair game???? Are you kidding me? 




  This admission that the NT is 0.05% wrong

That wasn't what was stated in the chart; it's claiming that we can only verify, through proper scientific means, as to 99.5% of it. Not that it's only 99.5% accurate. 




 Most of the time, if it's just the post-exam attitude, the person is look at a B. 




 FF9-  :( 




 I honestly wonder about that exchange in retrospect. If Beasly had stayed he couldn't *possibly* have been worse than miller was... right? 




 I don't think he did. 




 Probably just a joke, because it's impossible to have civil discourse over Ron Paul on reddit, generally speaking. 




 I stopped after that fucking eye on day 12, I have to study tonight, does somebody want to tell me if there are anymore creepy images? 




 written*

come on man! 




 IIRC they were 41-41 the year before Thibs/Boozer came. So yeah, I find that hard to call them "contenders." 




 To be fair, the bulls weren't a contending team when he was coaching them. 




 This isn't a logical fallacy of anecdotal evidence dude. When someone makes a claim "all people can float" you only need one data point of "nonfloater" to prove it wrong. 

If the statement was "most people can float" then that's a whole different story. 




 You can disagree, but there are absolutely people out there who simply cannot float, no matter how proper their floating technique is. I'm one of them. 




 per the sidebar: **this is not a forum for soliciting or giving legal advice.** 




 Yeah, because who is Nixon anyways?? 




 ...really? 




  Are you fucking serious? He said the legislation would legalize child pornography. This is as absurd as saying the forth amendment legalizes hiding evidence from cops.

lolwut? 




 That's so cute.
