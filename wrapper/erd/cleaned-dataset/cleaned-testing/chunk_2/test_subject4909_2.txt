 "My name is Barack Obama, and I approve these shoes" ? 




 Municipal workers. One of the main grievances is that the municipality arranges to employ people part-time so as to avoid benefits due to full time workers. 




 I've seen some, mostly on the CGT's website but also on that of the CNT I believe. All were solely in Spanish. 




 I've said this before elsewhere. It's the NITPIMBY phenomena -Not In The Pool In My Back Yard. 




 Probably very far indeed. The authors found that there are multiple alleles for the gene coding hyaluronan even amongst the naked mole-rat's closer relatives. The one amino acid substitution un ique to this animal may not work at all in an organism far from the clade like humans because multiple substitutions may be necessary. 




 Living Utopia is a great documentary. There are some other documentaries on the Spanish anarchists and the Civil War, but this is the only one which, to my knowledge, has the English subtitles. Others are only in Spanish. Am I wrong ? Are there others ? 




 Seems like a worthy project. I see you're already a member of the US Federation of Worker Co-ops. You might be interested in the r/economicdemocracy subreddit. Also if you haven't already do look at the [1worker1vote](http://1orker1vote.org) website for an example of another ongoing project. Also have a look at the [IWW](http://www.iww.org) website and see if you might want to sign up. 




 NITPIMBY - Not in the pool in my back yard. 




 That's a thought actually. 




 Terse and very much to the point. 




 You're welcome. 




 That may be true.

 . . .   Libertad para Alexandr Kolchenko, antifascista de Crimea, secuestrado y encarcelado por el Estado ruso!.   


Desde hace varios aos, Kolchenko es conocido en Crimea por sus compromisos antifascistas, sindicales, anarquistas, ecologistas. Durante la intervencin militar rusa en Crimea, Alexandr Koltchenko organiz manifestaciones pacficas de protesta contra la ocupacin militar, que false el referndum, al lado de ciudadanxs ttarxs, ucranianxs o rusxs.

Durante la intervencin militar rusa en Crimea, Alexandr Koltchenko organiz manifestaciones pacficas de protesta contra la ocupacin militar, que false el referndum, al lado de ciudadanxs ttarxs, ucranianxs o rusxs. Algunos das antes de una de estas manifestaciones, la polica poltica rusa (FSB) secuestr a varios organizadores de estas resistencias populares; fue el caso de A. Kolchenko, le 16 de mayo de 2014.

Con otras tres personas secuestradas as, se le acus en particular  de organizacin de un grupo terrorista relacionado con la ultraderecha ucraniana . De ah una serie de acusaciones delirantes: a Kolchenko se le acusa de haber planificado explosiones cerca de la estatua de Lenin en Simferpol los 8 y 9 de mayo, saboteado lneas de ferrocarriles y elctricas, intentado incendiar locales de la Unidad Rusa y de la Comunidad rusa de Crimea el 14 de abril, y los de Rusia Unida el 18 de abril!

Alexandr Koltchenko es un antifascista que la polica poltica trata de hacer pasar por un fascista.

Alexandr Kolchenko es un hombre que se considera comme ciudadano ucraniano y que la polica poltica rusa quiere juzgar en tanto que ruso. Est encerrado en condiciones drsticas, sus abogados estn privados de los derechos elementales de una defensa digna de este nombre y el est bajo la amenaza de 15 a 20 aos de campo de trabajo.

A. Kolchenko es estudiante y militante sindical; tambin trabajaba de cartero, en paralelo con sus estudios. Defiende activamente, con su prctica, el derecho de organizarse libremente, ee derecho de crear y animar organizaciones asociativas, sindicales, ecologistas o polticas.

Forma parte de los hombres y mujeres que luchan contra la extrema derecha, que sea ucraniana, rusa u otra.

Puesto que est luchando contra la corrupcin y por la igualdad de derechos entre todxs, A. Koltchenko es el blanco de los clanes oligrquicos en Rusia y Ucrania.

A. Kolchenko milita por el derecho de cada pueblo a decidir de su propio porvenir.

La situacin de A. Kolchenko es emblemtica de la represin ejercida en esta regin del mundo. Pero su caso dista mucho de ser el nico. A travs de A. Kolchenko, sont las libertades democrticas de todxs las que defendemos. Nuestra actuacin, como la A. Kolchenko, se opone a quienes desean menguar dichas libertades.

Por la liberacin inmediata de Alexandr Kolchenko y por las libertades democrticas en todos los pases, nuestras organizaciones asociativas, sindicales y polticas piden, con motivo del Uno de mayo, la ampliacin de la solidaridad internacional con el fin de denunciar el secuestro y la detencin de A. Kolchenko por les autoridades rusas (que decidirn la fecha de su juicio a principio del mes de mayo), exigir sa liberacin inmediata, y para que el Gobierno ucraniano reivindique explcitamente la liberacin de Alexandr Kolchenko.

Despus de la semana de accin de inicios de abril (manifestaciones en Biarritz, Pars, Estrasburgo, Marsella Kiev, Minsk, Berln, Bremen y Tnez) lanzamos una suscripcin para financiar los gastos de justicia y auxiliar a los comits de apoyo para popularizar la campaa de solidaridad en Rusia y en Ucrania. Las ayudas se deben remitir a Solidaires Comit Kolchenko, 144, bd de la Villette, 75019 Pars.

 Erdogan doesn't *always* get his own way. 




 Well the wording of the law is probably just some 'tuck in' put in to satisfy someone in the process of drafting it who is unclear on the concept even though...get ready for it... it is *technically* possible. Let's go to mtf surgery first because it is the easiest case. What the surgeon can do is instead of removing the testicles is replace them in the inguinal area, preserve the vas deferens and reposition its outlet to a place in the new vagina. To my knowledge this has never been done. What it is is an artificial mimicking of cryptorchidism, undescended testicles, the most common birth defect involving the genitals (1 to 3% of regular births, up to 30% of premmies). One possible side effect would be *reduced* fertility, though this may not be complete. Up to 11% of retained testicles can still produce sperm. Another possibility is a higher risk of cancer in the repositioned testicles. Retained testicles have a significantly higher risk. I have no idea of what the risk would be in comparison to congenital cryptorchidism, and because it hasn't been done before nobody else does either. 

There are probably other things to consider that are outside my knowledge, but I can be fairly certain that *no* legislator knows even the little I have described above. The result would be a physiologically fertile male with none of the genitalia involved in actual sex-related fertilization. I suppose any sperm produced could possibly be harvested and used for AI. Boy would that be a good one for a hospital ethics committee.

Just last year the first reported uterine/ovarian transplants were done in Sweden. These were, of course, done on females. How this will work out in terms of tolerance and fertility I don't know, and once more I'm fairly confident that *nobody* knows. Can rejection be managed without enough deleterious side effects so that a normal pregnancy can happen ? Time will tell. Transplant medicine has certainly made major advances over the years, but this is an 'edge of the universe' surgery. Who knows. As to creating a normal and functional birth canal along with this, well the surgeon that could do this would be in line for divinity. This news is also probably unknown (or forgotten) to almost every legislator in the world though it was given a certain amount of publicity.

As to ftm surgery there would be an 'outside' chance that testicular transplants could also be possible though this also involves more than simply a 'new pair of nuts'. To my knowledge the only testicular 'transplants' that have been done are 'autologous' ie the tissue is from the patient's own body. This has been done for patients undergoing chemotherapy which will destroy fertility. Pre-chemo testicular tissue is harvested and later replaced post-chemo. Obviously this can't be done in mtf sex reassignment. There has to be a separate donor. Then there is the process involved in creating a *functional* system like the difficulty in creating a birth canal. The surgeon involved may not be eligible for godhood, but *would* be a candidate for canonization.

So, summing it up the procedures to retain fertility in sex reassignment surgeries are *possible* though fraught with difficulty. I doubt, however, that these details were known to the bureaucrats framing the legislation or legislators discussing it. So, I may be wrong, but I believe that the stipulation was placed in the bills out of pure confusion. 




 I wonder hat their annual production is. 




 I wonder who could have downvoted this and what their reason might be. My imagination says that it might indicate that if I die I might unexpectedly have "benefit of clergy". This canonization has long been a contentious one. The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/22/us/to-some-indians-in-california-father-serra-is-far-from-a-saint.html?_r=0) and, [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/25/pope-francis-junipero-serra-sainthood-native-american-controversy) have covered it last January. Here's a couple of interesting facts:

1)The planned canonization of Serra is being announced *at the same time* as the US Senate is debating the removal of his statue from the National Statuary Hall on the Capital. The proposal moves to replace it with a statue of astronaut Sally Ride. 

2)The first 'miracle' which allowed Pope John Paul to beatify (elevate to the status of 'Blessed') was the supposedly 'authentic' cure of a nun with lupus in 1986. Now lupus is an 'interesting' disease. The prognosis very frequently involves a waxing and waning course including apparent spontaneous remissions. In other words this is a rather threadbare miracle. In any case he became "Blessed' in 1987.

3)There also a couple of other things that even the great majority of Catholics don't know. One is that the old rule that it took *two* authenticated miracles to go up the Sainthood ladder is being waived more and more. A lot of recent Saints owe their title to this change in practice. It seems that every advance in medical science leads there to be fewer and fewer good miracles to go around.

4) But there's still more that is also unknown to even the vast majority of Catholics. Remember the 'Devil's Advocate' (called the Advocatus Diabolicus by the Church ) ? 'Remember' is the proper word. No such thing anymore, for some time actually. This official of the 'Congregation for the Causes of Saints' was abolished in 1987 by then Pope John Paul II. The 'Saint Machine' has an easier and easier time of it these days.



3) 




 If you track through on the reference in Le Monde to the site of the National Assembly you get a complete vote total with abstentions. The three Front de Gauche members voted *pour/for* the bill. There were no abstentions from their caucus. There were a number of abstentions amongst the PS bloc. 




 Have they not 'failed' multiple times before ? 




 The Hubble Site may have more references on it. 




 I see. The data was gathered by a collaboration between the three different telescopes so I guess this is indeed 'different'. 




 I'm afraid that I have a hard time determining what the difference between the two would be. 




 That's interesting. I wonder what the percentages are. 




 Thanks. 




 Yes, Utah is not the only place where this model is being applied. It just happened to be in the news now. The difference is that a need is being met without assuming that you have to punish and 'correct' first. 




 'McCafe' ? Big in the cup but mostly foam ? 




 Yes, generally they are very young and un-experienced. It isn't just the mods. It's also the clique/cult in which they are situated. The life-stylism definitely yes. Their isolation and cliquishness shows over and over. The post-leftism less so - *except* there is a sort of 'alliance' going on. Post-leftists are allowed a lot of leeway that sensible people are not *provided that they make the properly politically correct noises* and especially join in the gang-ups. They are even allowed to make properly *abstract* criticisms of identity politics provided, of course that they remain abstract and don't interfere with the day-to-day application of PC witch hunting and that they join the mob when called. The two points of view are, of course, totally incompatible in reality, but in addition to ignorance about anarchism the clique/cult has an amazing ability to avoid coherent thought.

I've often struggled about how to describe the things I see there, and several uncomplimentary adjectives come to mind. Of course what they preach was pretty well unknown 20 years ago even if it as actually beginning then. Think the faction fights in Love and Rage. L   R had a deeper history. Go back further, say 40 to 45 years ago when I first became an anarchist. Yes, I'm an old fart. The division was even deeper then, but there was something happening then that is very similar to these people now. Think the Weatherman cult, as the New Left was disintegrating and some of it was sinking into the Maoist black hole. All the glorification of mindless violence. Up to and including hero worshipping the Charley Manson cult.The desperation of a declining movement that couldn't accept the fact. The reduction of politics to slogans and simplistic hatreds. The imaginary identification with a caricature of an 'oppressed' that in reality wants nothing to do with them. It's all there. I've seen this nasty mindlessness before, and it isn't pleasant to see it again.

But this is too long. Talk to you later. But yes, irony is well beyond  them. 




 Got it. 




 You mean that it has already been fading for a long time ? Or that it is too short a time to tell ? 




 Ah, but you have to take an actual numerical estimate, and then repeat it in other locations.  




 No, far from it. Lots of people besides that particular cult have a bone to pick with these actions. 




 Good question. I'll think about this and get back to you. 




 I never knew that. I only became interested in moderation at all, specifically in r/anarchism, about a year ago when I noticed an incredible amount of childish aggression and posturing and... went in search. 




 I guess that's within the realm of the possible. There has, however, been tension and disagreements between them before. 




 I'm fairly confident that that is true. 




 Yes, of course, free speech has been a cardinal point of doctrine amongst *the majority* of the anarchist movement since the 1800s. Whatever doubt there may have been was more than resolved by bitter experience, particularly the Russian Revolution but also the Spanish case. I think one of the keys to understanding the strange opinions of the cult/clique that runs r/anarchism is the fact that they know very little about anarchism. The level of ignorance there is truly amazing. I've seen more than one person try to point out the disconnect between what they believe (and unfortunately practice) and the anarchist tradition. Quite often these obvious facts are simply deleted. 

I am not as familiar with the situation in r/socialism, but I assume it is the same though less dramatic. Certainly less silly posturing about violence in imaginary internet worlds. But is this merely my lower familiarity rather than a real difference ? I don't know.  




 As I've said here before it's been years since I've eaten at McDonald's. One thing I remember though. The Big Mac was as likely as not to make me feel nauseous. I don't know why. Maybe the mayo ? I ended up sticking to the plain burger you mentioned. Now you tell me it's gone. Too bad. 




 I guess that's true in the case of a Commonwealth as opposed to a State 




 I haven't disgraced their doors for a long time, but I can certainly see your point. 




 Well, even though I don't agree with your politics I'm glad you are starting this alternative, and I wish you success. There has been at least one other alternative sub on the socialist side of things: r/socialistbeta  that was set up as a hopeful alternative to the generally low level of discussion on r/socialism. One of the big problems is that a crusade for purity naturally attracts the most aggressive characters, and these come to dominate the whole discussion. It also attracts those who, bluntly, *don't give a flying fuck about making the ideas popular but would rather construct an imaginary identity*. From that point of view driving people away very much serves their purpose. In the end the online 'community' comes to be representative not of the general run of the mill person who holds certain ideas but rather of a self selected 'elite' of the most aggressive.

The problem is, in fact, worse on the anarchist side of things, and there have been several attempts over the years at alternative subs that might 'tone up' the intelligence level and 'tone down' the triple distilled hatred. r/AnarchistNews is the most long lasting of these. I've recently started another, r/worldanarchism, which will hopefully concentrate on *non-American* news and views. The shared problem of both anarchists and socialists on reddit isn't even representative of the majority of American leftists, but it is certainly more concentrated in the USA than anywhere else. 

That's all. Good luck. 




 Picture Obama coming ashore wearing a sombrero. 




 I don't think this is universally true, and it certainly is a lot better than in the USA. 




 Most of the people I have known over time who have been 'on call' have been relatively well paid (railroad, medical, seasonal 'emergency', etc..). It can be nerve wracking even if you're paid well, and indeed on call for low wages is an atrocity. 




 I want to thank you immensely for your contribution here. I was thinking of trying to answer some of the assertions myself, but I obviously would have had to do a lot of research to find the facts that are at your fingertips. This is greatly appreciated.  




 Says the fool who doesn't know anything about hat he yells at. I do know quite a bit about the legacy of Stalinism, more than a rhetoric spouting idiot who lumps everything he hates together and has no concept of actual history. What I do know is that good fanatics like yourself are the willing tools of every dictatorial regime. Try to know something about what you pontificate on next time. 




 One can only hope that the US intelligence agents responsible will also be brought to justice. 




 I guess it's a  temporal wormhole from Newton to Einstein, but, what the heck, facts can get in the way of many good stories. Honestly I had a hard time even understanding some of the comments. Information is indeed irretrievably lost, and that string proves it.  




 Yes, it does. The authors found that oxytocin receptors occurred on both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. They were also quite explicit that their discovery of the lateralization to the left auditory cortex was quite important as well. What they didn't make plain, in my opinion, was whether the receptors on the inhibitory neurons 'tuned down' previously existing inhibition of that brain area due to said neurons or whether the inhibitory neurons were stimulated to inhibit *other* neurons that 'tuned down' a prior response to excitatory impulses. 




 I never looked at them. Let's see.

EDIT: I looked, and I see what you mean. It starts with 'white holes' and goes downhill from there. Actually a few of the comments were sensible, but many went into the zone of not even being wrong. 




 Oh Jesus H. Christ. My first honest-to-God serious right winger on this subreddit. Oh boy, oh boy, oh, boy. Please step towards that vat of liquid amber over there. I want to treasure this moment and preserve it for posterity.

In any case this reinforces my decision to try and concentrate this subreddit on *non-American* anarchist news. You may not be an anarchist, but you sure as hell are an American. The USA is the only country in the world, to my knowledge, where ignorance amongst a large fraction of the population (on both the left and the right) is considered a virtue. For the *majority* of Americans, however, and the overwhelming majority of the rest of the world "larnin'" as my old man would have said is a *good* thing.

In any case I'd rather talk to the original poster, but I'll kindly provide a few facts of life to brighten up your dismal world. There is such a thing as 'Marxism-Leninism' which is the *actual* meaning of the word 'communist' when it is used in everyday talk. This thing is *not* the same as the economic system of 'communism' which may or may not be achievable. Marxist-Leninists do indeed aim at dictatorship, but *so do numerous dictatorships, actual and potential, supported by the USA across the world*. There is a big world of political differences outside of crude right wing American rhetoric that said rhetoric tries, sometimes desperately, to ignore. 

Some anarchists may be, shall we say, 'dodgy', but the majority of the movement across the world has *never* advocated dictatorship of *any* sort. It's actually the *exact* opposite of that. If you wish to pontificate on 'anarchism' I'd suggest you find out what it actually is first. 

As for the original poster I will be asking questions of them and talking to them soon. The point that you should know, assuming you are interested in learning anything at all, is that their ideology, so-called 'African socialism' is not, not, not the same thing as communism/Marxism-Leninism. It has resulted in dictatorship in some places in the past, but these regimes have not shared the totalitarian ambitions of Marxist-Leninists. I disagree with that ideology, but your tiny world view blinds you to what it actually is.

 




 No problem. I am just being neurotic. 




 Oops. I will delete and repost. 




 That's an unsettling thought isn't it. 




 I think the author actually agrees with you. What he is doing is posing a question of how information/resources could be exchanged between components of the 'new economy' while maintaining its democratic nature. Is this an easy question ? No, and you pose one of the problems. What I would say is 'keep the risks small'. It's a matter of future discussion. 




 It's meant to be. 




 Yes, it does. It's a sudden burst of color seen at sunset if conditions are right. 




 I suspect that Cheney more or less likes his family.  




 I think that there are two different conceptions of both morality and free will operating here. From what you say the 'free choice' of an agent in a situation of incomplete information is, to Harris, the be all and end all of the morality of said choice with no reference to consequences. I think Chomsky is alluding to the way in which self deception (which he and Robert Trivers have discussed) plays a role in grading the morality of a choice. The information available to a free agent can be *deliberately* incomplete because of a prior decision to avoid certain information. I don't think Chomsky makes this plain, but it seems to be a factor to me. In this case the 'negligence' is deliberate and the 'severity' could have been predicted by information that the agent avoids.

OK, that's all the philosophy that I'm going to do today. 




 The world always holds surprises. It depends every much on how much pressure the USA decides to apply and *also* on what credibility their pressure has in Ecuador today. In Ecuador itself the issue is a 'cross-class' one gaining support from a number of sectors of the population. 




 I'm not that familiar with Harris. Does he make his money by 'punditry' ? 




 Yes, that's probably a valid criticism. 




 Thanks. I forgot about that detail. 




 Are the Libertarians in power in *any* of the US States where marijuana has been decriminalized ? Never say never. It took a right wing Administration to end the Vietnam War and to open up to China. The world is complicated. 




 A few probably have, but an even rarer event is that they have had relatives or friends who have gone to prison because of drugs and either die there or die later when they come out worse than before.  




 I'd guess that the only convictions that would be affected would be in Ecuador itself. 




 Thank you for the information. Can you expand on this ? 




 That isn't hat happens in the real world as European experience has demonstrated. 




 You do realize that meth is pretty well a 100% domestic product. 




 I don't know the full details of the legislation. On a local level probably 'yes'. Export ? 




 Which is spent on military expeditions targeting the peasants. That's the reality, and peasants in the Andes know this very well. 




 A few lesser known historical facts should be brought up here. The first was that father Gapon was a paid agent of the Okhrana, the Tsarist secret police. This was part and parcel of the Okhrana's policy of 'police unionism'. It obviously didn't work out very well. It was, of course, from a police point of view not the *greatest* failure. Looking at it from 'over there' precipitating a revolution was less of an 'oops' than having your agents kill government ministers and even the Tsar's uncle. Oops !

Time ran on and the SRs found out that Gapon was a police agent. A group was sent to kill him, commanded by one 'Azef'. The task was completed in 1906. It took three years for Vladimir Burtzev (yay !) to gather enough evidence to show that Azef himself was an Okhrana agent. Azef managed to escape from France where he was operating at the time due to the fact that the 'trial judges' (mostly SRs but including Kropotkin) were *very* much opposed to Burtzev's claim. It's a long story, but Burtzev had to bring forward the fact that he had corrupted a police officer who passed the info on.

While the idiots forced the delay, demanding that Burtzev "kill himself", Azef made his escape to Germany. Burtzev was pissed. He had to reveal one of his most valuable sources. Kropotkin was on the tribunal, but he wasn't as aggressive as the SR judges. Later K expressed his great gratitude for Burtzev's work. Which all goes to show that the worst people in the world to be judges on a tribunal are Russians. But more seriously it shows what happens when the romance of conspiracy overcomes common sense. Looking at it from the other side it's a great demonstration of how the best laid plans can blow up in your face. 




 Don't forget to factor in airfare and hotel in a projected budget. And, of course, bribes. Lots of bribes. 




 I don't think 'bathsalts' are a big thing in Ecuador. 




 No, it appears to be all drugs. Don't forget that Ecuador has been the victim of the US war on ~~drugs~~ peasants for decades now. Think cocaine, a dirt poor peasant and a US piloted plane passing overhead. If the peasant is lucky and he has paid the proper bribes he might not just live but even keep his crops. 




 I'm not too sure. I haven't seen any numbers, but if European experience is anything to judge by they will indeed decrease. 




 One can only hope that the US pressure will decrease for one reason or the other. 




 Muy bueno por Ecuador. 




 Thanks for the info. 




 I may be wrong on this, but I believe Uruguay legalized only marijuana. I understand that Portugal has legalized 'possession' of any drug across the board.  




 I believe that the use of a pesticide has to be approved in a 'crop by crop' manner. No doubt what you are saying about tobacco is correct, but this is a matter of regulation and bureaucratic rules.  




 I guess you're right on that. Good point. 




 For an introduction to the anarchist side of things see [An Anarchist FAQ](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html) . 




 Thanks. I was going on only the trail from the Physics World article. 




 No connection to the UAW that I know of. The [federation/alliance](http://www.industriall-union.org) was founded in June 2012 by four international unions. Since then it has grown a lot. In the USA the USW are an affiliate. The USW have been doing a few international things in the last few years. Aside from IndustriALL they are a component of Workers Uniting along with British unions. They are also allied with the Mondragon federation in the [1worker1vote](http://1worker1vote.org) organization to promote workers' cooperatives.  




 Yes, that can be the best thing to do in some cases. I often do that, but in this case the original paper is behind a paywall. I use the original when the full paper is open source. Otherwise I tend to stick to the title in the secondary source, in this case Physics World. 




 ??? 




 It all comes down to who gets to define what the "foundations of Islam" are.  




 Yes, I'm sure the pictures will become more and more informative as the craft gets closer to Pluto. 




 Here are three good books that can help you out and direct you an endless wealth of other sources:

1)The first three volumes of E.H. Carr's 14 volume history of the Soviet Union. These deal with the period you are interested in, and Carr regularly devotes a section on finance within each time period he is describing. Impeccably researched and documented.

2)Alex Nove's 'An Economic History of the USSR'. A less enjoyable read than Carr mostly because of a narrower focus, but in some ways more detailed and useful than Carr.*IMPORTANT POINT - I checked, and to my amazement the book is available on the internet at Google Books.* Carr's history would be available at University libraries, but only the best would have all 14 volumes.

3)Samuel Farber's 'Before Stalinism: The Rise and Fall of Soviet Democracy'. Well written but has less about your particular interest than the other two. Written from a non-Leninist Marxist point of view, and the author's main concern is political ie how Soviet democracy could have been preserved if various factions had made the right choices. 




 There's cold, and then there's *really* cold. It does make me wonder, however, what they could be made of. 




 This is a really good presentation. Thanks. 




 Maintenance in Antarctic conditions must be quite the feat as well. 




 Or whoever owns that robot. 




 From the point of view of the business owners it's the furthest thing from a 'failure'. 




 Those are interesting numbers. 




 It could also fit in as a measure of how many jobs have been lost in some situations. 




 Yes, but in pretty well every existing society things like 'comfort', 'time' and *opportunity* 'to pursue more interesting activities' are as unequally distributed as economic resources are. In fact they are often very much the same thing. OK, that's *now*. Should technological advances destroy jobs history is pretty clear on what happens. Opportunities are *not* equally distributed, and the benefit of the technology goes to a few while for others they get nothing or their situation deteriorates. 

In no way does this mean that technological advance should be stopped; it's just that it has to be looked at in its context, both historical, economic and social. 




 In one way it was a British equivalent of continental anarchosyndicalism. It believed that the economy should be democratically controlled by 'guilds' that were both a throwback to medieval guilds and also the equivalent of continental syndicates. It differed from continental anarchosyndicalism in several ways. One is that it saw a continued need for a state, for government. Another difference is that it was thoroughly non-revolutionary, advocating a gradual transition to a democratic society facilitated by elected politicians. Finally it was never a mass movement like continental anarchosyndicalism was. Continental anarchosyndicalism was perhaps the most authentically 'proletarian' movement that history has ever produced. British Guild Socialism in contrast was more of an intellectual movement even though it had its sympathizers amongst the working class. The guild socialists relied much more on 'converting people of good will' than on anything resembling the union organization of continental anarchosyndicalism. 




 All that I can say to that is that it takes a great deal of semi-religious faith to assign the word 'smart' to a phone. Maybe some people have truly genius rocks in their back yard. But yes, I know people are easily indoctrinated, but this weakness isn't infinite.  




 As an older person I can say that people of my generation would find that 'repulsive'. Interacting with the waiter(ess) is one of the pleasures of dining out. I hope that younger people will also feel that this is taking robotic impersonality to a ridiculous level. 




 I see. Various articles on different subjects on Wikipedia have different styles. It is, after all, user generated. I've never really thought much about the different writing styles there. 




 What are you referring to ? I can see a few grammar quibbles . For instance the "however" in the third sentence shouldn't lead off the sentence. The "-" in the second sentence would traditionally have been a semicolon. I must admit, however, that I also use "-" or a full colon instead of the correct semicolon. In the third sentence the more common term is "wholefoods" rather than "wholefood", but the second is probably acceptable. In sentence 3 there should be a comma in front of the "and". In the last sentence I personally would have left out the comma after the date, but I *think* this is still acceptable. It also is unclear because the author left out what the "170" modifies. Once more, however, the meaning is clear even if clumsy. 

You are probably referring to something more than this as being "weird", but I am uncertain what you are speaking of. 




 As the Luddites realized long ago. 




 In terms of the historical roots (French mutualism which created France's labor movement and later anarchosyndicalism and even the American individualist anarchists such as Tucker, Spooner, Labadie, etc.) it is obviously a 'socialism'. If you want to look at mutualists who self-define as socialists they put forward their own point of view in places like C4SS (Center for a stateless society). 




 Most of the research done has been trying to dice out certain factors from a complex situation. Very few real life situations are simple one factor changes. When the research is done, with the aid of truly heroic statistics, the most outstanding factor that regularly comes up is simple demographics. The higher the percentage of males from say 18 to 25 in the population the higher the crime rate.

New York would be an interesting study because it did indeed have a reduction in crime during a certain period. Those who wish to increase budgets say that this was due to the 'no-tolerance', 'broken window' policy put in place by the Major of the time. The reality is that there are *many* contributing factors, and the best that can be done is to assign a percentage with uncertainty to each factor. One of the biggest problem I can see with New York is choosing an appropriate control ie a comparable city. Most of the research that has been done takes national rates as a control, and that has difficulties. 




 To paraphrase Orwell, "some opportunities are more equal than others". 




 Oh no. I assume the coloring book comes with its on supply of disappearing ink in all the colors. 




 Well done. I like your comeback. The physician involved must have been really old fashioned. 




 I'm afraid that the selling price is unknown at this time. 




 Gracias compaero zeabu.  En beneficio de las victimas del sistema excolar Americano proporciono un resumen Ingls. Los EE.UU es el major ejamlo de un pais de habla Ingls que Deben saber Espaol.Pero la ignorancia es el objetivo de las escuelas Americanos.

Pot favor me corrija si usted piensa mi resumen es incorrecto. La filosofa no es mi puento fuerta.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

A summary of the article  above appears below. I don't have the time for a full translation at this moment. 

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

This article is from the Spanish language 'Philosophy Web', and it deals with a subject that actually may be more relevant in  English speaking countries, especially the USA, than it is in Spain or Latin America. The basic argument is against philosophical relativism. The most outstanding example of this is 'post modernism' in the USA which is being exported along with other industrial waste to the rest of the world. I will try in this summary to bracket my own opinions with an '[]', but I am sure that such may leak through to the summary. 

The title of the article translates as "I don't give a shit for your opinion'. It discusses a linguistic divide between opinion and its increasing promotion as opposed to 'fact'. [This is quite relevant in the present situation where 'post-modernism' holds sway in the university classrooms of soon to be retired (I hope)  American academics. This intellectual fad has spread outside of the USA. Hence this article from Spain. It also reminds me, to my discomfort, of the predictions of Russian sociologist Pitirim Sorokin who predicted an oncoming 'Age of Belief' that would supersede  an "Age of Empiricism'. While not willing to buy into Sorokin's determinism this may be an apt description of what has been happening in some regards.]

The author begins by tracing two concepts back to their Greek words. These are 'doxa' which may translate as 'opinion', 'common sense' or 'uniformed observation'. The other pole is 'episteme' which may translate as 'science' or 'informed statement'. The difference is between 'appearance' and 'reality'.

The essay goes on to how informed views are being discredited in favor of 'opinion'/doxa. The first stage of this process is a [propaganda] effort to maintain that there is 'no difference' between the two ways of viewing the world. This advances into the idea that both ways are 'equal' and that the difference between the two is a  matter of 'taste'.

One of the most important aspects of 'science' is that it is being continually being refined. The author contrasts this to the situation of 'opinion' where there is no mechanism for improvement, and he/she goes on to describe a situation, that of a bank loan, of how the two ways of seeing produce different actions. [The 'opinion' option, of course, may lead to bankruptcy if the bank persists in its folly].

The essay goes on to discuss 'relativism' which in effect denies an external reality, saying that all opinions are equal. [This, of course, is the venerable argument in philosophy between idealism and materialism]. What the media do is present the "stupidity of eqidistance' [from reality], and it uses the example of evolution/creationism as an example. Two sides of an argument are presented outside of any connection to reality that could allow judgement. In this context the 'debates' become 'set-ups'. [Entertainment rather than information.].

The author goes on to express the opinion that such debates become merely 'quantitative'. Right and wrong no longer exist. Simple weight of 'opinion' becomes more important than any way of differentiating between different points of view.

In such a situation no 'consensus' in the sense of a melding of different points of view in a 'dialectical' (non-Marxist sense) is possible. All that happens is an 'exhibitionism' of opinions where opinions no loner require evidence.

[In sum, in the Burt 'opinion', the essay is one more criticism of relativism, and it has political ramifications. I obviously agree because I am at heart a realist.]
 




 Thanks for the contribution. I tend to get a lot of news from South Korea, mostly from union federations and, of course, Labour Start. Korean workers tend to be very militant, and personally I think it is very much connected to the 'patronage' system of South Korean business. Trustification there seems to make Japan look like a truly competitive free market. So many labor disputes in Korea become political disputes almost automatically because the lines of patronage extend into the state as well to a greater degree than in other countries.

To my great disappointment I have found little in terms of *present* contacts with Korean anarchists. It seems to be all history. When the Asian Anarchist Network was really and truly operating posts from Korea were few and far between as well. I don't know what the problem is. Perhaps a more pervasive repression in terms of cowing people not with legal penalties but rather with the 'promise' of perpetual unemployment. But quite frankly I don't know. 




 Yeah, there are some of these do-gooder money machines that I have truly learned to hate over the years. PETA is one. Greenpeace (North American version) and Rainforest Action network are two others. Here's what happens. A local struggle begins. One of the leaches finds out about it. They sent a small contingent of travelling 'suckers' (or leftist bureaucrats on the make) to said locality and proceed to publicize the local struggle as a **fund raising opportunity** across the internet. The process actually predates the internet. Consider Newfoundland and the early NWT before Nunavut.  The people they send are 'weird' from the point of view of the locals *including the locals who started the campaign*. The invaders become a matter of embarrassment for local people, and, miracle of miracles, the whole community is united in hatred of the 'invaders'. Meanwhile the 'other side' uses the 'professional activists' as propaganda against their local opposition. Net result: five points down for the local opposition.

I'm most familiar with this in relation to Greenpeace. Their latest invasion involves a small community in Nunavut fighting against gas/oil exploration. I'm also quite familiar with the way that Rainforest Action Network parasitized the struggle of the Grassy Narrows people in Northwest Ontario. There are many other instances. I just tend to remember some.

PETA is in a class by itself. They can invade situations where there is no organized local struggle, appear, disappear and leave nothing but embarrassment and an increase in their bank account. They did this trick in Detroit during the water cut-off struggle. They parasitized a struggle that had nothing whatsoever to do with their supposed goals (besides making money of course). Besides embarrassing people in Detroit they contributed absolutely nothing, sweet bugger all, to the struggle to prevent the cut-offs.

OK enough emotion. It's not good for an old fart. I'm sure that there are other parasites besides the three I've mentioned above.  




 The subjective experience ? Yes, possibly. 




 Well I once more would say they are the same thing. As air molecules move past and touch the surface of the object some of the kinetic energy of the object is transferred to them as well. The difference between this and molecules directly in front of the object is that only part of the energy is transferred by the contact. 




 Oh God. A song with the lyrics "let the love flow" just popped into my mind.  




 They are sort of the same thing. Take the kinetic energy of the object just before it hits the air (assume a discrete boundary). As it descends it 'compresses' the air in front of it thereby changing kinetic energy into thermal energy of the air molecules. At the same time the air molecules exert an equal and opposite force on the object thereby slowing it down. This is the 'friction' referred to. The energy transferred to the air molecules is equal to that exerted on the object. 




 I'll try. As I said it may be dated. It's an idea that I've carried around in my head for over 25 years. 




 Good. Please do. 




 I guess that's true. It sure, however, has entered the language as a metaphor..."the road to Damascus". 




 Good question. Do spiders have the subjective experience of pain that we (and probably most vertebrates) have ? That's a bit beyond my knowledge. 




 Thanks. 




 There was at least one Greek philosopher who held to a sun centred cosmos. During the Renaissance Galileo escaped the death penalty. Copernicus escaped it by being dead already - his book was published posthumously. I think the heliocentric model was 'one' of the reasons why Giordano Bruno was killed, but I am not 100% sure on that. 




 China: 1)Incredible diversity, unappreciated by the outside world. 2)Oldest (more or less) continuous civilization. Stuff to see. 3)Rapidly changing and therefore interesting. 4)Soon to be the most important country in the world. 5)Interest in Pinyin (official national language). 6)Reportedly very hospitable country. 7)At least in the usual urban area I will personally be the biggest threat to the water quality. 




 Thank you. That seemed like a very informative article. 




 Yes, this guy wins some sort of 'nasty award'. 




 That's interesting. I'm going to have to try and compare them myself. 




 You're welcome. I've read several things over the years about 'muscle supplements' and liver failure, but I can't remember right now which compounds were involved. I'll have a look. Thanks for the comment. 




 You're probably right about that. 




 Thank you. 




 Thanks. 




 Yes, that's true. The thing is, however, that payment due is not an asset. When a private company declares bankruptcy the secured creditors will have their claims (payment due) compensated, at least in part, by funds raised by liquidation of the company's assets. Wages due (claims due) have a lesser priority than other debts do. I don't know how this works with a public entity such as a city. 




 Thanks for the information. I've actually given little thought to the subject of what influence small newspapers have. There are several in the city where I live, and I know that they are often good platforms for commercial advertising, and they may be useful for politicos as well. Thanks. It's food for thought. 




 Well, he's clear if nothing else. One thing I am unclear about in bankruptcy law. Secure creditors get first claim on assets, and wages owing are usually not in that category. I wonder how pension funds rank in the lineup. I imagine it is complicated. What assets do cities have that would be of any value to a pension fund ? 




 Well, there have been numerous epidemiological studies of the effects of economic conditions on mental health problems and yes, depression increases with decreased job security. There are also others studies, once more many, of the health effects of social class, including mental health. I'll see if I can dig up a good overview. 




 Will do. I've seen this sort of problem before, and usually is quite innocent as in somebody not properly undating (or adding) the security certificate for a site or a part of a site. Still, it's not always innocent. 




 I thank you profoundly for the great link. I was unaware of the Cornell project, and the site is fascinating. I signed up for some of the newsletters immediately. I see that their bird count (on May 9) is separate from the long running Christmas bird count. If you are connected to the project please note that when trying to access the count project from the link list at the bottom of the screen that it gives a 'security warning'. It is probably totally innocent, but I've learned to pay attention to these warnings and not proceed any further. Too bad. If you are not connected with Cornell please inform me, and I will try to email them myself about the problem. 




 Indeed. Humans as a group can be tremendously short-sighted. Sometimes it reaches the point of deliberate, malevolent attempts to retain ignorance. Think of politicians in the USA representing coastal communities and their attempts to deny climate change (South Carolina).

This incident also brought the 2009 Aquila earthquake to mind, and the court case that dragged on and on about it. I believe the accused involved have finally been vindicated. Earthquake prediction is a chancy affair, but sensible recommendations are often lost in bureaucracy. The circumstances are different, but there are relevant issues connecting both events (and other disasters). 




 That's been a long standing problem, and there have been numerous attempts to frame legislation to prevent it. None of these laws has yet solved the larger problem. Here's an interesting fact which may be dated but still has relevance. The side effects that you may see on labels, inserts and pharmacists' handouts are **95%** discovered via independent reporting by physicians, veterinarians, pharmacists, etc. The drug companies own reportage accounts for only one in twenty of the cautions. 




 It's interesting to think that the original objects were discovered and named by an amateur astronomer in a citizen science project. Not all science operates with huge budgets and bureaucracy. 




 From what I have read Muhammad was influenced by both Judaism and Christianity. I don't really know how much of each comes through in Islam. 




 Alternative futures. Would Islam have come into being without Christianity ? The classical Greco-Roman pantheon was pretty much past its best before date by the time Christianity rose to popularity. Would another of the mystery religions have served the same functions as Christianity ? 




 Thanks for the info. 




 Thank you. 




 Yes you are correct. I should have left the title alone rather than 'jazzing it up'. 




 No problem. It's something like hearing that 'Bill Jones' will be addressing the Chamber of Commerce annual meeting on the weekend. If you Google 'Bill Jones' you may find that a year ago he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Then you look at the phone book to get a visual on the problem. 




 The report comes from the United States Geological Survey, an organization that I don't think anyone could accuse of being unscientific. 




 Two things you should pay attention to in the references you provided. One is the history of the Energy Foundation China. It seems that this organization founded in 1999 (16 years ago) seems credible to not just the Chinese government but also to several US foundations who fund it. Also have a close look at a photograph of one Eric Heinz receiving an award from the Chinese government, last September I believe. Study that photo.

Now go to the cv of M. Heinz (French extraction now doing a post-doc in Germany). Look at his photo. Different person. Now examine the cv that M. Heinz provides. There's a lot of things there. One is that, if I presume M. Heinz spent the usual 10 years in getting his PhD then he would have been all of 14 years old at the time when he was a 'founder' of the Foundation as claimed by the Foundation's website. Now look at the cv once more. M. Heinz is a *computer graphics* specialist with no connection to anything remotely connected to energy or conservation. There is also **no** mention of the Foundation and indeed no indication that he has ever set foot off the European continent.

How did you confuse these two utterly different people who just happen to share the same name ? 




 I highly recommend subscribing to that site. Some may find it too 'popular science', but in my opinion it sometimes can be as good as Scientific American. 




 Yes, that's a good and striking presentation. 




 The Longshoremen have long been one of the unions with the broadest world outlook, and this is true to the tradition. What I don't see, however, is the duration of the strike. One hour ? Three ? Eight ? A full 24 ? 




 I wonder if there is some pun hidden in the name La Gordissima and the El Gordo lottery ? 




 Young, fresh and full of new ideas. Isn't it true that the 'peak years' in many fields occur earlier than people might suspect ? 




 No disagreement, but the use of the word "dissipate" brought a smile to my face. 




 But that's a 'forecast' rather than a report. A graph there shows positive GDP growth in the first quarter - not 'outstanding' but at least positive. No doubt the 'recovery' wasn't all it was cracked out to be in many ways. I'll agree with you on that. 




 Thank you. I've started to go through the various links, and it will take me some time to put it all together in my mind. 




 That's an interesting and perhaps troubling point of view, and I'm going to have to look further at it. One minor thing though, not the central point of your comment. I disagree that reduction of carbon emissions automatically means lower economic growth - even though energy consumption per capita is often used as equivalent to GDP per capita. Take say an increase in the production of solar panels which (hopefully) leads to lower carbon emissions. This increase is in fact economic growth not its opposite. Take, for instance, the growth in electric vehicles which (again hopefully) leads to lower carbon emissions. This may be any of three options, growth, decreased growth or no effect. The list could go on and on. 




 That's unfortunately a problem with *all* research that is scientific in nature ie reports confidence levels. In reality there is always uncertainty. It isn't restricted to demographic estimates. You will see the same thing in such 'hard' subjects as physics. The 'weight' of the electron, the magnitude of the fine structure constant, the speed of light, and so on and so forth. All of these have the old 'plus or minus' a given number of standard deviations when they are reported. It's the uncertain nature of an uncertain world. 




 Even better. Without janitors they'll have to pick up after themselves. *A collective cheer comes up from the long-suffering mothers of politicians*. 




 I'll have to try and look that up. Thanks. 




 The article that I recently read (see previous comment) is 'Climate Change and the Permafrost Carbon Feedback', Nature April 9. I hope the following [link](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v520/n7546/full/nature14338.html) will take you to the open access article. I sometimes have a problem with articles from the Nature Group being visible to me (I'm a subscriber) but not to others. Get back to me if there is a problem with the link.

In any case the major thrust of the article is that their models say that the carbon release from permafrost will be slow and gradual rather than fast and precipitous. I hope so. 




 That's what some may say. That opinion becomes more and more common the higher up you go in the ruling class. What I find encouraging, however, is that China *is* changing. The feminists are joining labor, environmental, human rights and literary activists, and more news gets out than in years past. I try to take an optimistic view of it. 




 I think you're right about the first statement, but I'm not 100% sure. I know nothing about the unemployment rates at various times, but I would imagine that they would have been highest right after the American invasion. 




 Yes it would be a positive feedback situation indeed. I think the uncertainty relates to the speed of release. I was recently reading about how new research suggests that the release would be slower than once thought. I'll try to dig up that article. 




 Thank you for the information. To me it's fascinating that RNAs in general are now such a rich field of research and even therapy. 




 Oops. Almost forgot to mention that English demands that the first word of *every* sentence be capitalized, not one out of three. My excuse is that that is punctuation not grammar. I still get a good mark in grade 3 English composition. 




 Grammar notes:

1)When using an equational sentence do *not* use a noun as the subject and an adjective as the object unless you mean to say that the adjective is a characteristic of the subject. 'Equality' is correct. 'Egalitarian' is not. Add the 'ism' to the adjective 'egalitarian'.

2)The proper contraction of 'It is' is 'it's' not 'its'. Its is the possessive of the neuter pronoun it.

3)Remember that prepositions are often necessary to make a sentence intelligible. Put the preposition 'of' in front of the neologism 'masculism'. 

4)Remember that the verbal noun in English is formed from the adjective when it isn't formed from the verb itself. The proper verbal noun should be 'masculinism' rather than 'masculism' as the conversion of feminine to feminism demonstrates.

Yes, I *think* about it. I *think* that I am grateful that I'm not caught in a confused mind game of opposing one abstraction to another and thinking it means something. I'm grateful that I can look at actual empirical reality and use language for describing such and suggesting *real* changes rather than playing at philosophy. 




 Oh shit. I'm sorry. I forgot that whether a Nature publication article may be accessible to me as a subscriber it isn't necessarily so to others. Let's try the following: go to a popular science article in New Scientist (something like a British Scientific American) on this research. Use my posting history to find it if need be. See the article there that allows you to 'click through' to the article in Nature magazine. If you can't reach it that way please get back to me. I tend to alternate between laypersons' sources and the scientific literature itself depending on the character of the subreddit I am posting to. 




 It depends what you mean by "allowed". Am I going to interrupt taking a good shit when the 'Batsignal'  says an ancap has posted, run to the computer with my pants around my ankles, take an epileptic fit and ban some commentator because they are not 'pure' enough, yell a bunch of rhetoric that was old when I was young and feel self-satisfied that I have 'done something' ? No ! Obviously ! 

Why no ? It's far less to do with politics than with the fact that I was already a mature adult at the time when the average redditer's grandmothers gave birth to their parents. I have no illusions about the *grand importance* of the internet. I have no identity crisis to work out. I also have 'nothing to prove'. Adolescence  is long past. Quite frankly the competitions of various groups to attack and counterattack on the internet seems more than slightly childish to me. The ambition to be top gunslinger in an imaginary Dodge City has no attraction for me. 

I'm tempted to pull the 'non-American' card out of the deck. This sub will hopefully concentrate on the anarchist movement *beyond the borders of the United States* as was stated in the intro above. The so-called 'ancaps' are one of the 'deviations' (to use an old commie word) that are incredibly unimportant the further you get from the Red, White and Blue. See the 99% number mentioned above. Exclude strange American stuff and that basically takes care of the ancaps in their 99%. Along with things like Maoist political correctness disguised as anarchism, silly dreams about the end of civilization and, to a lesser extent, the making of terrorism out to be an 'ideology' (which, of course, has a large component of zombie Maoism to it as well). 

Personally the great majority of what I see from ancaps strikes me as a 'philosophy fad'. How many syllogisms can dance on the head of a pin. The American political equivalent of Thomist philosophy/theology. What is done is to take a few unexamined axioms and start deducing things *without any reference to the real world* - producing a *great ergo*. That's all fine and good for sophomore philosophy majors, but it is a howling emptiness out here. 

This wasn't always the case. Let's go back to those maternity days of redditers' grandmothers. Take the period 1968 to 1972 for example as the New Left was spiralling towards the Maoist snakepit. At that time people like Karl Hess, Jerome Tucille and even Murray Rothbard in one of his earlier disguises were all gung ho for a right-left alliance, and there were issues at the time that were opportune for such an alliance. Those issues are no longer of any great importance.

The players, however, were quite different. On the right the 'paleocons' were much more of a factor than they are now. Nowadays the religious right is an incredibly more important factor they were then. On the left, confused as it was, the 'New Left' was a *much* more important factor than American anarchism is today, not that American anarchism doesn't deserve the adjective 'confused' as well. Take a broad estimate of how 'popular' anarchism is in the USA today, including all variant definitions of it. Got a number ? Multiply that by another than ranges somewhere between 100 and 1,000. I have my own crude estimate which is about 1 in 7,000. So, for every vague anarchist today there would be between 70 and 700 vague New Leftists. It's a different world.

I have my own ideas of where this sub should go. Perhaps I didn't make them plain enough in the introduction beyond the fact that what anarchists are doing and thinking in other countries can stand as a corrective example to the problems of North American anarchism, bringing it 'back to its roots' as you will. 

Once more I run on at the mouth. I'll close with the fact that I recognize the *unimportance* of the ancaps and see little benefit in playing mudpie throw with them. Just like the fact that I think online diy pop psychotherapy disguised as 'anarchism' is ridiculous and is not any sort of 'anarchism' worth promoting. Similarly airy philosophy debates - the ancaps - are not a valuable use of time. 

To use a couple of old metaphors, one of which was probably not current amongst urban people when it was popular out in the boonies; "The 'usefulness' of some things that pass as 'anarchism' in today's USA makes tits on a boar look like a Swiss army knife. 




 Can you elaborate ? 




       ? Honest to Christ there is nothing about this to be concerned about. If this ever gets out of the house of wild dreams don't forget that it will be built  by the Russian government and Russian workers and then operated by Russians. Actually Russians are very nice people, and they can accomplish miracles - *providing nobody is foolish enough to plan the miracle*. If Stalin hadn't had a nervous breakdown when the Germans invaded the troops on the front would never have made the miraculous chaotic withdrawal they did, and Germany would have won WW2. To quote Chekov from Star Trek, "Russia inwented bullshit".  




 That happens to be the criteria that many anarchosyndicalist unions have adopted, and some such as the CNT-E made and make an effort to have as few paid staff as possible. That, however, seems to be something quite separate from the question of whether paid staff of *another* union can sign up in the IWW. The matter of staff salaries is something that has to be decided in said *other* union, not in another one such as the IWW that works on dual card principles. It's definitely a good recommendation for any union, but it is quite separate from the question of IWW membership. 

I doubt that any of the hugely overpaid executives of various business unions are panting at the door to take out IWW membership so the grossest possible example is moot. As to the lowly pen pushers, door knockers, flac runners, etc. it might be an idea to qualify their eligibility by income, but that becomes so complex that I don't think it is realistic. 




 Glad to have you onboard zeabu. Yes, it will be a great deal of work as I'm finding out, but I hope it will be worthwhile. You raised so many issues with your post, and I can't deal with all of them at once. Let's look at the first one you mentioned, the eternal and unrelenting posturing about violence towards the police in r/anarchism (and other places). It often seems like this is the *one and only* thing that ties the people that frequent such internet boards together. That and not saying 'bad words'. And, of course, a few other selected 'enemies'. All moral questions such as the compatibility of this sort of rhetoric with what anarchism is all about aside there are some practical problems with it that deserve attention.

Let's start with the aura of juvenile 'snottishness' that it casts on the movement. Most people reading such things would assume that the authors were either uncontrolled thugs - or much more likely - bratty 15 year olds showing off how rebellious they are. It creates a situation where the illusion of 'internet tough guy' becomes some sort of weird *principle*. It's mere showing off, and it paints anarchism as a phase of childish rebellion that people who become adults outgrow. Personally I want to present the ideology/ideals as a reasonable proposition that rational adults might want to consider. 

There's another observation that people may and possibly usually draw from seeing the high volume rhetoric. That is the pretentious show-off nature it presents. Fake, fake, fake and fake. That may be an even worse image to present than being thuggish. The violent claims are wildly out of touch with anything that is even remotely possible.

Police tasked with monitoring this sort of thing know that very well. If they were under some delusion that the nonsense was imminent and actually meant - well they would put a rapid end to it. It also, however, provides other benefits to those it is supposedly directed against.

First of all information gathering. It's very nice to have lists of people that *might* in some unlikely future actually pose some sort of threat. Such lists can be used should 'sting operations' be considered to produce a news story that can be 'evidence' of the need for increased surveillance budgets. It can also be used as part of evidence in court where the actual charges are considerably less than the wild internet fantasies. It can be further used as leverage for blackmail should a law enforcement agency wish to recruit informers for more in real life situations. Useful, useful, useful. One of the things I find almost amusing is that the rhetoric spouters often assume that they have some miraculous ways of hiding their real identities from surveillance. Really ! In their imagination they think they can play in a league that only other large governments can do.

The violent rhetoric provides a 'badge of identity' that some think can serve as 'proof' of their 'sincerity', 'commitment', 'bravery' or even in a bizarre inversion of reality as proof of 'advanced political ideas'. In actual fact it is an illusionary substitute for the real commitment of examining reality and trying to devise realistic ways of changing it. Put briefly, it prevents thought. In some cases thinking or learning are the exact opposite of what some people want to do.

Using violent rhetoric that is popular in certain small and shrinking subcultures easily becomes a way of avoiding learning about what a subject such as anarchism actually is and trying to imagine ways of making it realistic and workable, recognizing the problems with that. Anarchism is like any other human endeavor. It is incomplete and has difficulties. You may have noticed that many of the dogmatic guardians of the absolute truth of *their* version of anarchism actually know almost nothing about its reality, philosophical or historical. As long as shooting off one's mouth remains their major activity they never will learn much. 

This getting too long. One thing I'll close on. Hypocrisy is a character flaw that draws almost universal condemnation. It is emotional rather than rational, but the examples of long standing advocates of foolish actions who remain year after year, sometimes decade after decade, immune from the consequences of what they call *others to do* is disturbing. Having being an anarchist for decades I have had more than ample opportunity to observe such 'heroes'.  




 No problem. It certainly seemed related to genetics to me. 




 In the English language 'myth' can be used in a number of different ways, each of them with a set of different connotations. There are other words like this such as the word "theory". In the way the author uses the word it carries the connotation of 'wrong'. Others may use the word 'myth' in different ways such 'widely known story that gives meaning/justification to present social practices'. It may even mean a story that everyone knows is untrue but is widely known and appreciated because of some aesthetic appreciation. There are no doubt other usages that escape me at the moment.

The way the author uses the word is as follows. He takes Smith's speculations about a human propensity to specialize in the production of a certain item or services and says that Smith believed that this was a universal human characteristic. He then says that said products or services will naturally give rise to a 'market' where a surplus will be produced and said surplus will be exchanged for other items or services due to a 'human nature' that naturally gives rise to such a thing.

What the author is saying is that this anthropological speculation is taken as a axiom by most economists, an assumption that they do not question because it is 'self-evidently true'. The author further claims that the actual facts of anthropological study of various 'economies' do not support this axiom/myth/assumption. That is his argument. He makes the comparison to Sorel's idea of the 'myth of the general strike' that gave meaning to the activities of early syndicalists.

There are various points where one may argue with the author, but he does use the word in one of its accepted usages. 




 Time for a little geography lesson here. The article mentions a range of 7,000 km. Now suppose you put the fleet in the enclave of Kaliningrad, a crazy thing to do granted but not outside the range of possibilities for a Russian government of any sort. Now suppose there's big trouble on the Amur and Russia wants to airlift the troops to Vladivostok. They'll barely make it. St Petersburg to Vladivostok is about 6,000 km. They'll be running on vapour at the end. Suppose, on the other hand they want to face off Americans instead of Chinese. From Kaliningrad to the last Russian island in the Bering Sea is 9320 km. Well, they'll get past Lake Baikal, but somewhere over Yakutsk - down they go. If you go west instead of east the fleet would make Britain, but somewhere over the Atlantic....blub ! Could it reach Egypt ? Yes. South Africa ? I'd have to look.

"Anywhere in the world" is a gross overstatement. 




 Yes, the two exemptions have to be harmonized in some way. I think that the two clauses would be better than trying to fiddle with the unpaid or underpaid officials part. I haven't seen the part about the political party officers and officials. I'll try and find it. 




 I'm afraid that's easier said than done. 




 'Asshole', 'plumbing', 'bullshit': It all fits together. 




 The authors of the paper describe the implications of their work in veterinary and human medicine. Perhaps I made a poor job of saying that with my modification of the title. So I`ll expand. 

The authors looked at an uncommon inherited neurodegenerative disease in dogs. They traced this disease to a missense error in the ATG4D gene which encodes a protease involved in autophagy. They speculate that their work may point the way to investigation of inherited human neurodegenerative diseases of presently unknown etiology. They also speculate that their canine model may be useful in designing and testing therapy for such diseases if they are due to errors similar to that found in these dogs. It also has veterinary application. 

I hope this answers your question. 




 I see your point, and I remember that news now. I had instances in mind where the two unions were non-IWW. The Fieldworks situation isn't exactly one of another union though it certainly seems to be in the same category. In the old days we would have called Fieldworks a 'front' and that would be all that needed saying. In the days of highly developed NGOs and quangos perhaps there should be a neologism. Instead of 'quango' (quasi non-governmental organizations) perhaps 'quanuo' (quasi non-union organizations) would be appropriate. 

Yes, the matter *should* be discussed at the branch level and the HQ informed. Perhaps there should be some standard questions to be asked in such cases. I have no idea of how you'd word a proposal that didn't simply forbid such organization efforts. Obviously the initiative should still remain confidential rather than public. I also think there should be a similar if less strict process in the case of general 'lefty fronts' rather than specific 'union fronts'. Think Sisters Camelot.

Definitely worth paying attention to.  




 Yes, anarchists can be highly moralistic at times, and the article perhaps dwelt on that. But as to your major point there have been many instances that I've seen where the staff of a union is represented by a totally different union, and labor disputes have occurred. I never dreamt I should keep count of such things over the years, but I am certain that I have seen more than 10. It's not like electing an atheist Pope. Personally I think the 'staff exemption' (unless a person is involved in hiring or firing ie is a manager) as it presently is should stand. It might be a missed opportunity at some time in the future. I'm undecided about your second point which, of course, follows from the first. Staffers are obviously the recipients of 'pay', substantial or otherwise.

Food for thought anyways. I'll try and get back to you on this. 




 No, I was just joking using cat breeds. I could have included Scottish (Fold) Gaelic and Egyptian (Mau) I guess. If you want to curse your cat, on the other hand, you have to speak in Russian Blue.  




 Two things about cats. One is that they only pay attention if you speak in Siamese or Persian. The second is that they *will* get revenge. But yes, it certainly does apply. In my opinion cats seem to be less trainable because they aren't 'pack animals' like dogs and humans. Not that they are antisocial. far from it as any owner of multiple cats can tell you. It's just that the motivation of "simply wanting to please" is less prominent in them than in dogs. 




 Very often the proper answer is *nothing*. I'd recommend *never* punishing unless the action has just happened in front of you. It just doesn't work. All it does is convince the dog that you are irrational. Here's a scenario that tells the story.


 Dogs can be intelligent enough to learn a great number of words in a human language. In the case of some border collies this may amount to hundreds. What they are totally deficient in is *grammar*. Let's take conditional and future tenses along with 'moods'. If you say, "If you shit on the rug I will kick you outside". The dog hears, "Shit...rug...outside". In their mind the word 'shit' may be either an indicative or an imperative mood verb. The conditional tense doesn't enter their mind. Neither does the future tense of "kick". What the dog does is go over to the rug, shits on it and then goes to the door to be let outside. From their point of view they are doing exactly what you want. Because so much human-dog talk is imperative the dog takes it as such. 




 I swear to God that you're the first commentator who hasn't come from one of the less accepting states. 




 How on Earth does the City justify an *18%* interest rate ? That's heading towards payday loan territory. 




 You get what you pay for, and in this case the lobbyists get the better part of the Congress. 




 That's true. Smith's work has been the subject of a lot of misinterpretation. Both works are available on the internet. 




 Well yes, that's a legitimate question. 




 Sounds more like the computer than the site. I hardly have the most up to date tech either. 




 It's the same way in all federal systems. The USA may be a little bit more 'states' rights' than other federal countries. 




 You're welcome. 




 Thanks for the link. 




 It`s interesting to note that the limitations of `hair analysis, in particular the `false positives' have been known in an academic way for a very long time. The problems with this evidence are well presented in most forensic science textbooks. I can assume that many of the wrongfully convicted were represented by public defenders who gave their cases less attention than it deserved *or* that the defense budget in these trails was so limited that calling expert witnesses to dispute the prosecution's 'evidence' was not an option.

There are similar, if not as glaring, problems with fingerprint evidence, and, of course, 'lie detector' tests are notoriously unreliable. In an issue of The Match a few years ago Fred Woodworth gave a good overview of the problems with fingerprints. 




 Yes, anthropology/archaeology can often be that way. It's like a Sherlock Holmes  story, making conclusions from what looks like scanty evidence. 




 Yes, I guess it's the old 'headline writers' dilemma'. You have to be attention grabbing to draw in readers, but it's very easy to stray into overstatement. 




 I guess it depends on both where you live, where you work and what has happened recently. Someone who has to commute to work over bad roads or poor train service will be more concerned than others about infrastructure. Similarly people who live in communities that have recently had problems will be more concerned than others - even if say the water treatment plant is overdue to collapse as in the next hour. I think (?) that Britain has less of a problem with an infrastructure debt than the USA does, but I might be wrong about that. 




 Just an interesting blog piece about how far dual unionism *should* go. 




 Great. It's very much appreciated.
