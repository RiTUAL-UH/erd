 Anyone got a link to this unique TF build talk??? 




 What we really said when we all started: "That champ's OP!" 




 Master yi with feral flare here. Get on my level. 









 It says that vandal twitch is on sale: http://gyazo.com/25e2e09742e682d655ed6db51c3b5fe1
However when i view the "on sale" tab in the shop it says that gangsta twitch that's on sale, not vandal.

Im on EUW im not sure it this is the same for all servers. 




 You won! :) check your inbox 




 I can pay it off, it's no worries. Appreciate the concern though :) 




 Meh, i'd rather make someone happy. 




 I accidentally bought 1 too many game Keys for Reaper of souls (it put me in my overdraft and now im going to have to pay my bank a fortune .) anyways i figured i may as well brighten someone's day by giving away the key.

Just leave a comment and i'll randomly pick one of you guys :) Good luck!


EDIT: Jojobtz won! Thanks for entering guys, sorry i couldnt give you all one :/ 




 Im still waiting for an ARAM Team Builder, riot. 




 Really hope they fix the Zed ulti bug :/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UI3c3EY17o 




 Our clients all went black as soon as we got into champ select, anyone else had this problem? Now we get this :D http://i.gyazo.com/5ec486ee15fe51e096f570b8a3429ad2.png 




 i really feel like you shouldn't force us to pick what champion we'd like to play and instead allow us to just queue for the position we want so that it could be used for ranked draft pick. 




 I played 2 before i played 1 and i have to say it didn't really change much, i fell in love with BL2 and it was that that made me want to play BL1. The story is BL1 is SERIOUSLY BAD i learn almost nothing playing through the game and ended up googling most of it to piece the story together. So in conclusion play which ever you like first :) 




 Im down, add Fuzzy on steam :) 




 wouldnt this get me a VAC ban or something? is it legal basically? 




 Im sorry for your loss, i truly am :/ and yeah i agree the whole "it gets easier" shit people say is a bunch of bollocks, the highest suicide rates in america are white males above the age of 80 and people are saying it gets better!? That said I think you'll go far buddy, school was something i never did too well at, but keep studying hard if school is something you can deal with.
