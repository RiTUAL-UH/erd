 You know, I know better--and somehow, in my hurry to share it, speed got the best of me. This is a terrible error. Just terrible but it was up and I was off--forgive me!  




 Ha--awesome feedback, that! 


































 Great, well-written story 



















 It seemed for a while like they were keen on pushing some boundaries with their APU but NVIIDA and Intel so strong on the co-processor/discrete GPU front, why bother, I guess is what they thought. Thing is, AMD developed a great deal of this well in advance of Intel--they just do a pretty shitty job of marketing. 












































 They just updated it with full confirmation--China is now far, far above the rest of the world in terms of its supercomputing might. the Cray Titan system at Oak Ridge Lab is a rather distant second... http://www.hpcwire.com/hpcwire/2013-06-02/full_details_uncovered_on_chinese_top_supercomputer.html?featured=top 




 Xeon Phi is really only meant for the high performance computing (supercomputing) market. At least at this point. It's real push seems to be on its lower end Atom-like chips. 




 An update was just posted a few moments ago next to the older ones. The editors secured a special draft report directly from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and are expected to share full details about peak performance numbers (as confirmed) as well as full specs for benchmarks, application range, processor to coprocessor ratio, memory subsystem and ooo...the interconnect topology. Exciting stuff for the supercomputing world. They note they'll post this around 11 p.m. Eastern or midnight. 



















 Wow--that summary (and its companion alliteration) is a better title than any of the others kicked out there so far. 









 That is a wonderful smile--brought one to me today. 





























 That would be...unexpected. 




 Thanks for the explanation Big Pervert. 




 Agreed--I respect that argument and agree that there are some Christian scientists that are....science-y. Still not sure how they pick and choose what to believe based on faith and what to believe based on reality, but to each his or her own. Thanks for calling me on that because you are right. 




 Yes, it's sort of like going to Salt Lake City to drink and gamble, but nonetheless.. 




 I always shy away from CSM because of the name of the magazine, but honestly, they have some damn fine reporters that aren't all....christian-y. As counterintuitive as it may sound, their best reporting is often on science. Go figure. 





























 Baaaaa-dass. 









 It's hard to find things to give to friends that aren't sappy or generic. After searching for a while I decided that I could never express both humor and happiness with Hallmark junk. And so, yes. :) 









 My first thought upon seeing this... "Florida"
