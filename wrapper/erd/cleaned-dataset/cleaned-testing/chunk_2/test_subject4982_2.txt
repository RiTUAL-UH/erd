 Will post my picture soon!  




 Any chance this came from someone in northwest ohio? I swear I saw this on a girls facebook page a few weeks ago.... 




 Melatonin should do the trick, it works for me every time. Good luck- hope you find the remedy right for you. Cheers 




 That's okay then it will be all juicy and fun! I canny wait to see, thanks for sharing.  




 You go girl!  




 Passing my blunt to you. TOKE ON!  




 Ask someone to get it with a bobby pin or a comedone extractor.  




 Dem blackheads.... 




 As an avid cocaine lover I want to lick that off of her then eat her pussy. She's not bad looking at all. 




 Congrats handsome! We all deserve happiness- even if it only lasts a moment. 




 Try  /r/beards !!

But I do love it!  




 Looooool hahahaha LOL  




 Heaven! Simply beautiful. 




 Yessssssssss! 




 When I was younger and played a lot of sports I had horrible acne on my back in the outline of my sports bra. One day I was trying to get rid of some of the acne and came upon this really massive bump under my skin. So I started to squeeze and squeeze, it hurt so bad. I called my mom into the bathroom and told her to get it out. Once it was fully out it was the hardest most odd looking thing just like that! It was the size of your standard pill capsul. I dropped it on the floor and it made a clinking sound. I'm assuming it was a really old blackhead built up from over the years!  




 LOLOLOLOLOLLOL 




 That's appalling. 

Good luck resting in Peace you selfish asshole. 




 Its fake. And call me crazy but it looks like an image of Jesus in that round white thing when you zoom in, but I'm really stoned so that could be it. 




 I could do that! Lol 




 Perfect! I love getting ride of them!  




 I didn't 'force' him to do anything, he asked me to do it and then complained the whole time.  




 He wouldn't let me take an after picture, he was squirming the whole time and threw away the napkin! We didn't get a long hence the ex boyfriend part! Haha 




 I got them out with an extractor. And if you do not have one, the loop part of a bobby-pin works just as well!  









 I wanna get that  




 OHIO!
