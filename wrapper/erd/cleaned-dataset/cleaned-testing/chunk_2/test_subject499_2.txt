 No...How do? 









 Yeah, it's possible but probably not true. That's a vast conspiracy with nothing to gain from it.

 




 We're defined by our history? 




 I think that's where the thought comes from. We, as a country, are not patriotic. I think we display our patriotism by not being patriotic. Those of us who are more patriotic just moan about our country the least. But I don't like that I've lived somewhere for over 20 years and still can't pin down exactly what my identity, as a citizen of this country, is. What makes us different? And it feels like what does, or what did, make us difference is slowly being drained away. I understand all countries, thanks to the internet, are facing some form of homogenisation, and westernisation can't be disputed. But it's difficult to face that in, say, ten years, we'll be America 2, rather than England. 




 Because most of the documents I fill out (whenever I fill them out) ask me to put "White - British" or "Born in..." it's always Britain/British, so I say British.

English, then. What makes the English English. 




 I didn't no, we moved on after that I'm afraid. Next time I'll see her I'll ask. I should really have asked... 




 American Pyscho.

Eh...probably spoilers.

You know, I'm pretty ok with reading about torture. But I guess it was just so casual in this case. The rat and the cheese and the pipe (if you've read it - you know what I mean).

But what got me most was when he killed the dog. I think it's a human thing to dislike cruelty to animals (it's why dogs rarely, if ever, die in films). But Bateman killed that dog and his owner didn't even realise and when he did he was so upset. I mean - he didn't have long to be upset but still. I just went and gave my dog a big hug :( 




 That's an interesting take on it...Never heard that.  




 You're just saying we, as a nation, have become americanised. Which sadly so ridiculously true. I doubt if it had been so strong, I would have had to ask the question. As a culture we've pursued America, and except for our lack of talent when it comes to cuisine (because Beans on toast is perfect, why mess with what is excellent?), we're just a smaller America now. 




 The thing about the royal family is that the country that cares the least is England. We did a news segment in England about how much more news-coverage our own royal family got over seas. 

The thing about Top Gear is that it started here, the original is best ;)  




 It's easy to ask the question. Solving it is another matter. 




 Traditionalism is a good word for it. Probably the one I'd have used if I was smart enough to do so. 




 Are you saying we all just go around like peacocks? 




 I think my first reaction was to deny this, but...I fell into the trap. You're right, haha. 




 The thing about the possibility of life is you have to consider the countless billions of *tiny* things that came together to make life on earth possible. And then there's the big things. A planet colliding in earth, breaking off the crust which formed the moon and threw us onto our axis. If Saturn wasn't where it was we might have been wiped out by an asteroid millennia ago. And then there's the small things. Countless small things. Billions. The size of the earth. The distance from the sun. The amount of water on the earth. If any of these things were out by 5% life on Earth could not exist. 

Billions.

But then consider that there are *billions of* **galaxies** *each with* **trillions** *of stars and potential planets.*

The universe is simply too large, and there are too many things out there for life somewhere else to be *impossible*. I find the idea that the exact same conditions couldn't have been replicated ludicrous. There are enough galaxies for there to be thousands of earths, and millions of planets with alien-species nothing like humans, living on planets nothing like earth.

Yes there is life out there. It can't be any other way. 




 So I was talking to my friend, who is Romanian, and trying to decide what our cultural identity is as Brits, but we couldn't really decide. Other than bangers   mash and bathing in tea. 

So, if you're British, what do you think sets us apart from other countries?

If you're not British, what do you think sets us apart from your country, that you do differently to us? And not just the base stereotypes, we're not all goofy, monocled gents.  




 Sometimes perhaps it's best not to prioritise writing. Perhaps it's best to take a break from writing, take a step back and collect yourself and your thoughts. Just read, or watch something, just do something easy. Stick to your exercise, but if you find that writing is inducing more migraines, best not to push it. 

Of course if you do want to push it, and writing might make it better, I find goals don't help. Sensible goals or not, you don't always make them. I find it's best to just try and sit down, write for as long as you can until you've had enough, and be happy with whatever you've written. After all it's something, a paragraph is better than nothing. 

Like I say: Progress for its own sake. 




 Someone who *actually writes*, and writes consistently. 

It's true there are a lot of people who research and plan and they talk a lot about writing, and they imagine they are a writer, yet they get surprisingly little *actual writing* done. I've met people like that. 

You don't have to write well, or be published, or for anyone to read it. Just write consistently, whatever you can and whenever you can. I think that's all there is to it. 




 I got out of a long term (5 year) relationship a few months ago. It was a massive adjustment to lifestyle. 

I suppose you just gotta make it through the week. If you can postpone the official, end-all conversation till then, more's the better. Unless you just wanna get it over and done with, of course, which is understandable.

And people change, no doubt about that. I've got a lot of memories of my ex, we did a lot of things together (both our 18's and 21st, first-time holiday abroads, etc), but there's someone else out there who's worth more than that. I heard something once, which I hold on to; there's someone out there making memories right now that they will later share with you, when you're together. 




 Whatever Indie scene (game, movies) I really have never minded supporting it. I would feel happier paying your 25 or my 16 into the Indie world than into Hollywood. (Having said that, the AAA game industry is heading down hill).

I expect Cineworld do. There's a premium of about 2-3 extra for 3D and glasses purchase on top so that's a bit of a rip-off. But at least the more people who use cards, the more they *know* for certain they will take in each month. The cinema trade - another business I don't mind supporting. 




 I heard someone say on the internet before that love wasn't worth it, why would you want the pain? And the heartbreak? I said why wouldn't you? Why would you want to feel nothing? And go through life hollow? Why wouldn't you want to feel pain? I would rather feel pain than nothing at all.

Savour the end of a thing. Embrace that you're about to start a new chapter in your life, and - for better or worse - that's pretty exciting. Just remember that for all the pain, at least it's something, at least it's a drive to move you forward and keep you going. It's just about the fight. 

Pain makes life worth it. Not just because without it happiness is meaningless. But because it's separate, and it owns itself.  




 My parents have all their old books from when they were children. I have a tatty copy of Romeo + Juliet signed "To Tracy, [my mom] from Mom, 1976". That's pretty cool. 

A few of my Granddad's book are signed from my mom and my uncle from sometime in the 60's. That was pretty special. My mom (being the oldest) got handed down the books when he died last year. Most of them were signed as presents to him from when they were quite young.  




 I have the Cineworld card - I pay 16 a month, and then make sure I get my monies worth. At 9 a ticket, I only need to see two films to make that worth it. Which for me is no challenge.

The thing about where your money goes depends on where the movie came from. Let's accept the majority of movies come from Hollywood, and screw them - they're rich enough. Look at Indie films, or British films, and devise how much money goes to them. They tend to get limited releases, and odds are they paid a lot of money to get that film into cinema. 

Honestly, it's hard to say where the money goes. 




 I've grown up on consoles that's the only reason. It's what I am and maybe always will be used to. 

And thanks, I really want the game, damn my job!  




 "so it goes."

I got that tattooed on me. This book is brilliant, I don't need to tell you why because others have done that for me. However; watch John Green's crash course on the novel and re-read it. Whole new excellent perspective.  




 Crap laptop. And I prefer the controller, Kinect and achievement system of the Xbox. I'm a console person =D 




 I can, at times, be very impatient. I want things, I get them. Indie games have their place, and I appreciate them just as much, but at times I need a AAA game, and I want it immediately. 




 Xbone =] 




 ProjektRed, man. What bugs? ;) 




 Convincing myself that *The Witcher 3* isn't a priority, might push my will-power to the edge. 









 It's a small price to pay for the size and brilliance of the games we get.

Except in Bloodborne's case. Fuck those loading times. 




 I may have missed out on the days of the arcade games, but I'd happily swap that for Oculus Rift, Band Hero, Kinect and open-world exploring.

I respect the previous generation of games, and those that came after it. But I wouldn't trade in what we have, and where we're going (the technology) for anything. 




 Was meant to find out today if I'm losing my job or not. We were told on Monday some of us were being let go, so it's been a pretty shit week. Been trying to push to find out, and hoping the people in charge get off their asses and tell us. Our manager (who's job is also at risk) was pushing to find out today. He did find out, and they know which of us are being fired, but they won't tell us until Monday evening. And they forbade our manager from telling us too. Because bullshit. 




 I am swaying towards Keyes, I must say... 









 Crash Bandicoot, ofc. Spyro, the original Rayman, Space Jam for PS1 was killer. Croc for PS1. 

I only had a PS1 as a child.  




 My height =[

Being a short male is not the best. 




 Might I recommend a different way to edit? Go through it now just for grammar. Nothing big, just the odd run-on sentence, and a few misplaced comma's, small, grammatical errors that are nonetheless important. You want these things fresh in your mind to edit them, so they make sense how you want them.

After that, give it *at least* two weeks. More is better. You want to be as far away from the novel as possible for when you edit. And after that time, you'll be glad you cleaned up the grammar because it suddenly makes a *lot* more sense. Which is good because hopefully you've forgotten about most of the novel from your separation. 




 Yeah I heard about them eating their siblings in the womb. Always reminds of that king in Stardust who kills his siblings to gain the throne... 




 It doesn't surprise me in the least this exists. Thanks, this will entertain me for some time now =] 




 Romantic grotesques?  




 I'm not sure what the system is over there (being English) but it's worth looking into leaving the union if you don't want to be a part of it. Save yourself some money. Double check your contract - if they're taking money out, that isn't for the state, it should be stated in the contract. 




 Can you not opt out of the union? I've had a few jobs and never joined a union, but if there is one I'm always *offered* to join. They never just take money out of my pay for it. 




 I wonder what the statistic is for global pizza consumption. Someone needs to look into this... 




 British =] I've heard of Saran Wrap but only in passing. Not enough to say what it is. 




 How you finding Neverwhere? Read any of Gaiman before? 




 It's probably a touch more romantic to say the cathedral is decorated with 'gargoyles' rather than 'grotesques' though. Even though grotesques is a much better name. 




 Really, really disliked this book. 




 I'm not sure what Saran Wrap is...Is it cling film? It sounds like cling film... 




 That it, haha. 




 I'm still more scared of spiders though... 




 Heard that one before. Unsurprising. 




 Thanks, never too sure on the exact definition of a planet, or dwarf planet.

And what about when the moon frees itself of our orbit?  




 Praise be to him. 




 I always found it fascinating that a moon is simply anything that is within the pull of a planet's gravity. Pretty interesting to know our own moon isn't a moon. 




 Absolutely *anything!*  




 Search your brain (no googling!) for the most interesting and, possibly, mostly unknown fact you can come up with and drop it below! Then we can discuss it :D. 




 Just wander directly into the realm of fiction. Don't try and ground it in science. Create your own, entirely fictional, technology. Such as the Mass Effect gates, or the portals from the Portal game series, or the Halo Rings (Man...I play too many video games). If you're too worried about your book aging, go that way. 




 Harry Potter, of course. 




 Because there was only so many races. Men, Dwarves and Elves. 

As far as the rings of power go, the One Ring doesn't count. The others were created by Celebrimbor but the one ring wasn't. 

I expect Tolkien had a very specific reason, and it most likely died with him. 

Also; there was more than three races of elves. The rings were made before the Third Age, so before the obvious division of the Elves (Lorien - Galadriel. Mirkwood - Thranduil - and Elrond.) When the rings were made the houses of elves were crazy everywhere. There were 5 families of dwarves to begin with, and they remained the most popular. Durin (the line of Thorin in the film and book versions of the hobbit). And men had pretty much been devised into Numenor. Though that race was split into two. Sauron does gloat however that of the 9, 3 were Numenorean lords.

It might been a display of power. The Elves were the most powerful, and it would have been risky to control too many. This is less true for dwarves, and really not at all true for men. 




 Popping in for a cuppa with the queen.

But seriously there's nothing to do in London. 




 ;) isn't it the best song? 




 Thing's don't get sucked into black holes, they fall into them. (No, I don't quite understand the distinction but yeah...)

At the centre of every galaxy, including ours is a *super massive black hole*. That's why galaxies have such bright centres, stars are being pulled in. Of course, we can't see black holes, so how do we know there's one at the centre? There are stars that we can observe moving at impossible-to-fathom speeds, being flung around a single point. There's nothing that can move such a large, dense star, unless it is a super massive black hole. And the star is being slingshotted around it. 




 My only best friend is a little orange envelope :( I don't get to see him very often though. 




 Taken as a recommendation on Reddit. I love McEwan, but this might be unlike anything I've ever read before. But he is such a fantastically brilliant writer. 




 George Ezra.

*Oh, so he's only like 20. And he's white...well buggar me...* 




 That would so absolutely change everything. That's a really interesting concept - that pockets of the universe were different ages. And being as we can't totally explain gravity, it might not be wholly farfetched either. That would mean we could observe not only a different part of the universe, but a part of the universe different in time and perception to our own.

*And still before we find intelligent life!* 




 *Parts of the universe could be older than other parts!* 




 That's what makes it super fascinating  The jump between the Sloan Wall and the Hercules wall is massive. I doubt that even if scientists predicted something bigger, they wouldn't have jumped to 10 billion light years across. By our own understanding of the universe something so large ought to be impossible. Nothing that big could have grown in such a (relatively) short amount of time. Maybe there's pockets in the universe where things grow faster than in other areas. Or the universe is just vastly older than we thought it was. 




 25 - Entire works of Edgar Allan Poe.

20 - S (or Straka) by JJ Abrams and Doug Dorst.

18 - leather bound edition of *Aesops Fables*

18 - clothbound 2011 edition of *The Picture of Dorian Gray* 




 The Triceratops and T-Rex lived further apart than Humans and the T-Rex.

Cleopatra lived closer to time of the moon landing than the building of the great pyramids.

Recently (unless it was a hoax), a new *biggest-thing-in-the-universe has been discovered. Previously it was the *Sloan Great Wall* - a cluster of super galaxies stretching 1.2 billion light years across. (No, you cannot fathom how big that is). Recently, the Hercules borealis wall (or similar name) was discovered, a cluster of super galaxies measuring **10 billion light years across**. Why so significant? Because in a universe *supposedly* no older than 14 billion years old how can something have become so large? The discovery of something so big could totally change how perception of the age of the universe. 




 I spent a year editing my own novel, read through it and edited it more than ten times. I was pretty damn thorough. And it's vastly changed, almost all of it. And I like the beginning, and it works well. But when I get to reading the end the difference in style and how much of a better writer I am at the end is so noticeable. I don't notice a sudden change half-way through the novel, or anything like that. It's a smooth flow. I actually quite like seeing how I had grown over the three years it took to write. Like a growth chart.

I mean, the book is shit, but at least I have visible proof it made me a better writer. 




 So I was going to say something positive, but it was only what everyone else has said. So let me reinforce it, you sound like a great partner. Also, she seems to be doing pretty successfully, which is absolutely great to hear. You must be quite proud. 




 Kudos. Most I could do if one came so close and scream and run like a little a girl. If I was on a chair I would probably tilt backwards and floor myself. I would panic like hell. 




 I sense sarcasm but I feel like I do. 




 Crying with fear. Literally just had a panic attack. I need help. All I did was squish it with my shoe. 

But hey, I guess, when I can breath I might sleep now. Probably not. Terrified still. No idea why. 




 It's gone midnight and I'm sat waiting for a spider to appear to kill it. I can't sleep. Not well. 




 Yeah, moved back into my room. Hopefully it won't come back *back* to me. 




 Don't worry. I know the fear is absolutely irrational. I know it won't harm me in any way. I just detest them. 




 Can't. Stepdad is asleep in the next room and he's...let's just say he wouldn't take kindly to it. 




 It's on a new carpet, I can't squish it against that. Also, that involves being close enough to ensure the job is done properly. Or else allowing it to run away to god knows where - probably where I won't ever get it. 




 I'm not so sure...This one had shifty eyes, and eight of them... 




 Into my sister's room is it. 

It's not very small either. Thick and black and just sat there, on the floor. I had planned on trapping it under a bowl for the night, but couldn't even approach it to place said bowl. Far too risky. And I don't want to sleep in there with it either. So...here I am. If I hadn't stayed up *tonight* and tried to finish my book this wouldn't be a problem.

Christ, I hate spiders. Oh, my fear of them isn't normal. It surpasses plain phobia. I really, *really* need to see a doctor.


Edit: IT IS HERE. IT HAS FOLLOWED ME! IT HAS SMELT AND SEEKS MY FEAR!

It came out onto the landing. I stared at it for a while, watching it, as it circled around and came closer to my room. I threw a show at it to little effect, and when I tried to step on it, deciding to act rashly rather than further succumbing to fear, it ran away. I screamed as it ran off, hiding now in my sister's room where I won't follow it. I could cover the bottom of the door, securing it, but not without risking the thing running out whilst I do so. That would too close. Now I am shaking, sat here watching my sisters door for it to return so I can end this. It is 12:30PM. I have work at 9. I am shaking from fear. I won't sleep with it still alive. 




 You could ask me, I'd be interested in a decent project.

I might PM you. 




 That does sound good. I've added it to a list on Goodreads of all the books I need to buy. Unfortunately I bought six books last week, and that on top of the more than ten I already own but haven't read. So I suppose I won't be buying it just yet. haha. I have book-buying issues. 




 Like I said; not as elite is it perhaps ought to be. 




 *The Amber Spyglass, by Philip Pullman*

*The Virgin Suicides, by Jeffrey Eugenides*

*On Chesil Beach, by Ian McEwan*

and, *The Ocean at the End of the Lane, by Neil (The God) Gaiman*

Fairly varied. And there are books that have come close. *Slaughterhouse-5*, (I have a quote tattooed on me). *The Kingkiller Chronicles.* And *1984*, amongst others. 




 Not sure about changes to the current one but I can help you with the next... 




 Well if you're interested in having someone write, or edit/proofread I would be super happy to help. If you're looking for someone... 




 Friendly advice: stahp! Just write! 




 Being sick makes you exempt from needing to be productive. 




 Get both =] 




 That's always helpful, so long as know what words to put down. That's the important bit. The writing. 




 Yeah I was at that stage.

*I'll never make 30k words....I'll never make 60k...80k...100k...Damn this never ends!* (Finished at 125k).

But 85k in 5 months is bloody stellar. Took my three years to write mine. 




 We'll be masters of VR and hover-boards. 




 You certainly aren't the only one, but that doesn't make it any smarter. You'll never finish anything this way. Finishing and then perfecting is how it ought to be done. Rather than perfecting on the way - as you write.

Sure you'll have a perfect sentence. But that is all you will have. A sentence. 




 My grandma's much the same. I wouldn't have any hope to actually get her to play a game. Neat thought though. 




 Man if I could get my Grandma to play some games with me I would be all over that. That would be interesting. 

Good day so far for you, no complaints =] 




 Took the place of favouritest ever novel alongside two or three others. It's not as elite a group as I'd like haha.

Gaiman is my favourite author. He is a god. 




 That's all it takes =] 




 I woke up this morning thinking *"Right, time to kill of my 7-year old sister,"* and when I read what I had wrote about her that hit me. 

The best line I've ever written is six words, and hits me everytime I read it. (It's the very last line in my novel, no you can't read it :D).

But someone said "No surprise to the writer, no surprise to the reader. No tears from the author, no tears from the reader." What you feel, the harder bits to write, put that into your writing, emote, and it will make it all the better. Part of being a writer is utilising that. If you feel for your characters, the audience will. If you don't care about your characters, how can you ask an audience to? 

Now go get your ass in gear! If you want to talk to me, I'm just an orange-envelope away =] 




 I found that writing a short story in the same universe as my own novel was a huge help. Almost to the point where parts of my book *couldn't* exist without it. It was vital. 

If you're struggling to write, write a short story, then if you drop it, it doesn't matter so much. You can evaluate your strengths and weaknesses, and get a feel for your world. 

Writing is just that. Writing. It's enduring the worst day and sitting your ass down and writing. It's realising that inspiration and motivation are entirely *useless*. You will never be inspired or motivated to write, but you just gotta do it. There's nothing more to it. Sitting down and let the words flow.  




 I agree with all of that. But for the actual creative part, the fun part of coming up with new things, and not knowing exactly where my characters will go, or how I'll write it, what I'll come up with, I love that. That's just the appreciation of literature. But, of course, it is all terrible without editing.

I edited my own novel for a year. That included removing 18k words and reading it over more than ten times. Three times out loud in its entirety. That sure as hell put me off editing.

This guy's a start. He's one of the biggest I've seen. Following links from his channel will set you on the right path to discovering lots of other book vloggers as well.

Of course there's no guarantee they'll do you a favour, but where's the harm in trying? 




 I would recommend whatever works for you.

I find that whenever I'm not particularly in the mood to write I just sit down. And three sentences in I'm lost. People always complain about writer's block without even trying to do anything about it. Just sit down and write and once you've got a little bit down you'll get lost in the story, and then that's it, you're writing. 

If you're only writing novella's there's no pressure to write a lot at all because it won't take as long to finish. If you feel happier just sitting down writing no more than 300 words, that's fine. If you want to write one hundred, and take a break and write another hundred, do so. If you sit down for a while and stop and realising your approaching 1k, I wouldn't be surprised, but that's great. Do whatever is easiest. If you want to try for a larger amount, but can't reach it, be happy with whatever you've done. And strive for a little less tomorrow. Or push your damn hardest to reach your word-goal. 




 So far, so good! The art style is fantastic.

Please tell me you're looking for a writer to work with you on the project!

(Why are you an egg being held in someone's hand?) 




 Sitting down and actually writing is what it's all about. Thinking about a thing is easy, writing is hard. Though it's super good to get ahead on the basis of the story. Nothing will come of it without those ever-so vital words. 




 Personally not a MOBA fan, but wahoo to higher productivity than normal! =D 




 I like to write every day. Not always possible. But I try. And if I do sometimes it's only 300-500 words. A paragraph. But that's why 1500 words is so important. You can get that in one day, or write little bits every day and still get it done.

We're the opposite. I dislike editing. I like actually writing. Editing is just painful and tedious. 

 




 Sounds like you did a lot of nice things for your mom. Pretty productive already, done quite a lot in a fairly short time - always a bonus! =]
