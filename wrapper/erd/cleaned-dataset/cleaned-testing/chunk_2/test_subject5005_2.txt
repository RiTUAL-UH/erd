   Instead, we have this choice/not choice debate, where by default they're conceding the ground that if it IS a choice, then it's wrong. Fuck that. If it's a choice, it's MY choice and keep the fuck out of it.

If it is then that doesn't mean I can't question it as strange. 




 How much is it genetic and how much is it psychological? Why do I get the feeling that you don't have the psychological aspect and feeling without the genetic aspect being apparent.  


































 So you can *feel* homosexual due to genetics but you're not a homosexual until you *act* on your homosexual desires that are wholly inspired by your genetics? Or do genetics play no role in homosexuality?

 Frank: I told my wife I wouldn't drink tonight. Besides, I got a big day tomorrow. You guys have a great time.

College Student: A big day? Doing what?

Frank: Well, um, actually a pretty nice little Saturday, we're going to go to Home Depot. Yeah, buy some wallpaper, maybe get some flooring, stuff like that. Maybe Bed, Bath,   Beyond, I don't know, I don't know if we'll have enough time.

  there's an invisible line somewhere in the early thirties that most of us shouldn't cross without taking it very seriously.

 Alright, alright, alright.  




 Cool. As long as its your tax dollars that pay for illegal immigrants to go to school while American citizens struggle to pay the costs of college and everything else then I'm alright with your delusional plan. Your tax dollars and money out of your pocket for non-Americans, not mine.  




 Yeah, but it bashes views that reddit feels are held by fat redneck Republicans so the stupid post stays and will frontpage. The wise teenage liberals of reddit probably are cool with ~~their tax dollars~~ their parents' tax dollars putting illegals through college when many American citizens - not illegal Hispanics - can't even afford college themselves and need to scrounge tirelessly for an education. Brilliant. Well done, wise teenage redditors who pay little to no taxes. Read the article and then reevaluate your delusional political beliefs.

When even the liberal commenters in the NY Times are outraged about illegal immigration then you really know how bad the situation has gotten.  




 You are the bravest redditor of the day for posting this may may attacking anti-science Republicans on reddit. You deserve a medal of honor for this may may. 









 I love how reddit's wise teenage liberals think that all of the illegal Hispanic immigrants pouring over our wide open borders are hardworking. Someone offer proof of this and I'll shut up and upvote this stupid cartoon. And no, the top comment and anecdote of this thread is not proof of anything. There are just as many criminal illegals and deadbeats pouring into these country for free shit as there are ones who work just as hard as you and your neighbor. We don't need these people here for anything. At all.

  The discussion quality on TiA has been horrendous. It's easily one of the biggest circle jerks on reddit.

The sub consists almost entirely of image posts because the mods don't allow self posts. I'm not sure what anyone would expect discussion-wise when this is the case. Sometimes articles are posted to TIA and there is good discussion but those posts are in the minority. If the mods want better discussion then they should allow self-posts but they don't want that. We see self-posts in this sub all the time and there is better discussion so I don't see why we can't have that in TIA. The mods just don't want it. This wasn't always the case there.

 So instead of looting and destroying the property of a group of rich White guys from Oregon they destroyed the property of the Black owners of a local mom and pop store? Sounds about right.

 Yeah but girls don't have the societal and necessary impetus to approach men to get any sort of romantic or sexual gratification started like in a bar or a club. Very few girls like you described exist and behave that way. There are more than a few unattractive guys that behave in an awkward and uncool manner but feel the need to try to engage because both society and women put that burden on nearly all males, both attractive and unattractive alike. It just so happens that the former has to do it a little bit less while the latter has to engage with women 99 percent of the time if they want anything to happen. Most of the time this doesn't end well for them while most of the time it ends well for attractive men. 

It's much easier to get labeled as a creep if you're a man who fucks up socially in romantic situations than it is for a woman to be labeled the same.
