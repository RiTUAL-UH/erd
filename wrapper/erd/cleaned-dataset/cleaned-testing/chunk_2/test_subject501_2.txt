 Everyone in this thread seems to think I don't have very good taste in cinematography. Yes, I have seen many, many films; but Interstellar has some of the best cinematography I've seen in a while. Some of my favorite DP's include Roger Deakins, Emmanuel Lubezki, Robert Elswit, Conrad L Hall, Vittorio Storaro.  

Some of my favorite films feature astounding cinematography these include American Beauty, Blade Runner, Alien, No Country For Old Men, There will be blood, Fight Club, Zodiac, Se7en, Inglorious Bastards and many others.

It's just my opinion, but I think Hoyte van Hoytema did a very good job in this film along with Chris Nolan.

 For those of you who have seen it, why is it getting bad/mixed reviews? What's wrong with it? How could they improve it? 




 Seen it. Love it. 




 There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary   Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, dry, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it. Not to mention the top-notch voice acting from Philip Seymour Hoffman, Toni Collette and Barry Humphries.

 Why all the hate for daredevil? 




 ahhh.....YES. 




 Direction is kinda weak at times and 'one note'.

The acting is pretty good.

Writing can be a bit flat at times but overall it's ok.

The cinematography...do I have to say anything? Roger Deakins yet again delivers a visual feast, every frame is crisp and balanced, the lighting is beautiful; it deserved that oscar nod. 




 Pumped for the movie? 




 Did you guys like it or not?  




 Tell me a bluray that you are willing to trade, the condition and region code.

This is REGION B only and in pretty good condition. 




 This just made my day. 




 Blade Runner and The Empire Strikes Back. 




 I totally agree. 




 Adaptation.

Irreversible

End of Watch

Anything Wes Anderson

Mary   Max (HIGHLY recommend)

 




 Paul Giamatti. 
Imagine [him](http://www.tvweek.com/blogs/tvbizwire/paul-giamatti.jpg) in full pennywise mode.
 




 So lets just start by saying that my eyes get really itchy when hop into bed. I don't know what is is but as soon as I lay down, they get all tingly and irritated.
So most nights I lay there rubbing my eyes for about 5 minutes or until I think enough is enough. 
I then usually stumble out of my room into the kitchen to get a cold flannel to put on my face.
The previous night I decided to put a flannel in the freezer to put on my face/eyes if they become itchy, which they did. 
So I got into the kitchen and staggered over to the freezer, seeing nothing but colors and shapes from the good, vicious and long rubbing that I gave them (come on it feels good), I opened the freezer (all lights were off btw) and grabbed the first thing that felt like a nice thick frozen flannel. I then zombie-walked my way back to my room and put the ice-cold solid piece of heaven on my face. 

Well I woke up the next morning; the pillow was red and so was most of my face. 
I thought I was in that scene from The Godfather, seriously, I was shitting bricks.
I then feel a soggy, warm and wet sludge-y like presence against my upper back/neck area. 
Well what do you know? It was the steak I was supposed to cook the previous night, wrapped in glad/plastic wrap. Most of the blood had leaked out from it and onto my face, pillow and some of my sheets. 
And of course the REAL frozen flannel was sitting in the freezer where I had left it. I swear it winked at me. 




 Are they? I didn't know that. 









 I would be great if you guys could give me some recommendations and advice, a link to a website that sells them would be great as well. Thanks in advance. 




 Google Images and trailer screenshots... 














 Why thank you 




 It does a little. 









 Wow dude, thanks for all that advice. Just a few questions:

What did you mean by 'some shitty bundle?'

Also, do know know any websites/books/resources that you think is a good starting point for somebody who wants to be a cinematographer?
 









 Can you guys give me some advice and point me in the right direction? It would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance! 




 Never seen The Breakfast Club.

Goodbye all my karma 




 That's the best damn summery I've ever heard.  









 I love every single one of PTA's films. Sure he's not for everyone, but he's my kind of filmmaker; dialogue heavy, contain dense and relevant themes, real and exuberant characters and top-notch writing and directing. 




 He's certainly not for everyone. 




 Not a PTA fan? 









 Good to see Inherent Vice on the list, was not expecting it. 




 Tell me, is your father a happy man?

 




 Just looking for anything that analyses the work of PTA. Please leave a link in the comments. Thanks! 




 In the T.V section, when I saw the words 'True' and 'Detective', I jizzed. 




 Why's that? 




 What did you think of Inherent Vice? (I'm asking everybody this) 




 She was a demon. 




 Nice to see Inherent Vice high up on the list. What did you like about it? 









 I have no idea why you are being downvoted, you made a sold point. 




 What about pro feminist? Because I've heard some people call it that. 




 Same here.  









 This thread is turning into the official discussion page for 'Inception' when it was released. 




 WHY are you getting downvoted? That's really quite pathetic. 




 I prefer them both the same, they are completely different genres. 




 For me it was Killer Joe, Se7en and The Chaser. 




 My vote for Zodiac made it in! :D 









 Yes! Thank you for commenting! I really want to get this video out there, it should be this video that has the most amount of views instead of some bullshit music video. So if you can, share this video with your friends and family. Like he said in the video, we can use the internet to unite and come closer. Thanks again. 




 I love every frame a painting. Watch his video on David Fincher. 









 So you have your mid shot, close up, long shot etc, but what exactly is an unconventional shot? I am new to cinematography. Please leave a response and an example from a film or something. Thanks a heap! 




 Snatch. 




 Start with South Korean films like:

* **The Chaser** (2008) HIGHLY recommend.

* **A Bittersweet life** (2005)

* **The Revenge Trilogy**

* **Snowpiercer** (2013-14)

And whatever else you can find :)
 




 No order:

**Edge of Tomorrow**

**Source Code**

**Inception**

**District 9**

**Interstellar** (Please don't downvote because of this)

**The World's End**

**Gravity** (or this)

**Oblivion**

**Wall-E**

**Pacific Rim** 




 Curious Case?  




 Oh, you have NO idea 









 District fucking 10. 




 This is the last director I'd expect to direct this. 
Nonetheless, he is a fantastic director. Just watch Prisoners.
 




 No Country for old men.

I would be hear for hours explaining the meaning of this film, so I'm just going to leave this here:
http://www.rogerebert.com/scanners/no-country-for-old-men-out-in-all-that-dark
 




 I wanna see Christoph Waltz as Franz Oberhauser! 




 True. Like women, r/movies is just one of those things that we'll never fully understand.

Goodbye all my karma. 




 [Zodiac](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443706/?ref_=nv_sr_1) (2007), David Fincher 




 Won't that be the day... 




 In your opinion, what is a really good poster? 




 I agree, I was very surprised that Gone Girl didn't get a nod for best adapted. 




 What's your opinion? 




 Please don't tell me that you're one of those people who haven't seen all the performances. 




 Rosamund was ROBBED. 




 Look at his face, and imagine him in clown makeup. 




 It's my favorite book, and it will be co-written and directed by the guy directed one of my favorite tv shows (True Detective) so I am hoping this turns out good.

Here's a few links: 
http://screencrush.com/cary-fukunaga-it-very-scary/

http://screenrant.com/stephen-king-it-movies-2015-2016-director/

 




 Sources aswell as the producer have said that the remake will be much more true to the book, it will be dark, gritty and very violent. 




 Who are you supposed to be talking to? 




 AND simon pegg???? I thought he was the main character? 




 See what happens when you fuck a pussy in the face! 




 [Mary and Max](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_and_Max)

My favorite stop motion animation film and also my favorite black comedy.

I URGE you to watch it. 




 He would've made a great Pennywise. But even then he played the Joker so I don't think he would've accepted the role. 




 I was thinking Paul Giamatti 




 I actually agree with you. 




 You are on reddit movies my friend, it's just what's going to happen. 









 You're judging from a picture? That's mature. 




 Why the hell are you getting down-voted? 




 This is awesome news. But not as good as the day when I open my r/movies feed and see 'District 9 sequel announced'. 




 Michael Bay 




 Why can't this be the bluray cover? 




 Yeah this has been questioned over and scrutinized for years. I don't actually know, I think it's just an easter egg. 




 That's a dick thing to say. 




 It's annoying because I can't prove to you that I have not downvoted anyone on this thread. 




 Well for starters, and I forgot to mention this, but Cuaron did not deserve Best Director, that should've gone to McQueen. 
Best Picture nod for Gravity was, to the academy, a no-brainer but come on BEST picture? That nomination should've gone to Prisoners.
An Bullock nominated for best actress? really? That nomination should've gone to Emma Thompson or someone whose performance was better.
When I said 'that years gravity' to 'Shakespeare in love' I did mean nominations as well as wins. 




 It did win other awards... 




 Sure It deserved awards, just the amount that it won. There were much better films in terms of story, substance and acting. 




 Peanuts? more like the small bits of salt that are ON peanuts. 




 Such a rob 




 That year's 'Gravity' 




 Any move that won a major oscar like best picture, actor, director, whatever, just leave it in the comments :) 




 I was thinking L.a confidential for a sec before you said it was released within the past few years. 




 Yeah that 'joke' almost made me fall out of my chair, I was so not prepared for something so....crude? But yeah I didn't know what to think. That's not to say she didn't have a good ass! 




 I love it. It's such an adventure. 




 The church scene is easily one of the best action scenes of the year. 




 Starting a Bluray collection and I just want to ask r/movies what are some essential movies to own on Bluray? 




 Why the downvote? :/ 




 The ending to Se7en. 




 /r/Chris_Stuckmann
Turns out there already is one 




 Im trying to make a stylesheet for it but I dont know shit about CSS 




 Now that you said it, it actually is okay. 




 We should do it together. What do you say?
I think he'll appreciate it. 




 That's okay, just don't fuck it up. Cough *alien resurrection* cough 









 What camera did you use? 




 Can't wait for this. 




 I'll be sure to do that next time
 




 Thanks so much! 




 Thank you! 




 I remember watching this trailer that was a spin off/parody of the cheesy 80's retro action movies, it was a bit like Far Cry 3: Blood dragon in its style and in the trailer it was about a vigilante cop type-a guy who is sent back to fight the Nazis but is instead sent back to the dinosaur age. I know it sounds really weird but the trailer was awesome and anyone who knows about this movie please comment the title or link to trailer in the comments. Much appreciated :) 




 This may become the highest grossing film of all time. 




 I don't see why you were downvoted for that, you made a very solid point. Upvoted :) 




 Detective Loki from Prisoners. 




 With Reddit I really feel a sense of community and I can't get that by just searching it on Google. I want people's personal opinions and examples of what Neo-Noir is and sure I can find that on Google but like I said, I'd rather ask r/movies. Also just looking through your comments you really do look like you enjoy condescending and picking apart peoples opinions, so please, don't get angry over little stuff like this. :) 




 Holy shit thanks for that!!! 




 Well do you have a better choice?  




 I could search it on Google, but I'd rather ask /r/movies instead. I've been hearing those two words ever since I really started having a passion for movies, and I never really payed attention. But now I think it's about time I started to find out what it is. Please don't down vote just because I don't know what it is.
