 Until we as a society are willing to make common sense bans on "that thing that goes up" we will never solve the mass shooting problem in this country.  




 Scenario:

1.  Kid throws can at gunman.

2. Gunman caught off guard for three seconds.

3. Gunman recovers and shoots kid. 




 Why is it Liberals never refute facts or debate? Liberals only shoot the messenger by being critical of OP or news sources. 

  




 As a Conservative, I am never embarrassed to tell the truth about the falsity of climate change. 




 Genetics have always separated us 




 She would be good for poles everywhere 




 I am sorry that your Liberal narrative is being refuted by reality. No one is stopping you from providing facts that you feel counter the facts provided in this post. 

Apparently, the Left views ANY challenge to their ideology as being evil or bizarre.  




 advocating for 'traditional marriage'

Her motivation for advocating traditional marriage is her own moral beliefs. That does not equate to her hating anyone. You are doing what the Left frequently does which is to assume anyone who has a different viewpoint must have an evil intention behind it. If someone stands for traditional marriage then they must be anti gay. Anyone opposed to Obama's policies must be a racist. 

I actually listen to Glenn Beck and he has never stated any anti LGBT attitudes at all. 

Apparently the old saying is true "Conservatives think Liberals are wrong. Liberals think Conservatives are evil" 




 These articles are not anti LGBT. One says people should not be forced to do business that conflicts with their beliefs. Religious people should not be forced to bake LGBT cakes just as LGBT bakers should not be forced to bake Westboro Baptist cakes. The government shouldn't force anyone to bake any cake that conflicts with their personal or business philosophies. 

The other article is about a woman who questioned the methods of GLAAD but was not anti LGBT.

Can you explain to me how these articles show the Blaze is anti LGBT?
 




 The Blaze is not anti gay. What a sad, twisted world view you must have.  




 What a miserable life you must lead. Don't you have anything better to do with your time than being an internet agitator?  




 You seem to enjoy trolling others who don't think exactly as you do. Are you intentionally trolling or are you really that unhappy?  




 Liberals get confused when their ideology clashes with reality.  




 You Leftists are never wrong. No matter what proof I offer you will reject it as inadequate. I could literally provide video proof and you would reject it as not enough. 

I reject religion as a guiding force. I reject YOUR religion. Why can't you simply allow others to make up their own minds? 

 




 You Leftists are never wrong. The democrat party is like a faith based religion rather than a political organization. 




 That the Democrat Party is no longer a party of ideas and classical liberal thought but rather the followers of rigid, leftist ideology.    JFK could not get elected as a democrat today. The party demands politicians in the manner of Barack Hussein Obama and Elizabeth "fauxcahontas" Warren 




 Two of the articles lists members of Congress  who  identify as hard left. How can that  be opinion? Dude, how did you make it through evil medical school?

 So you maintain that the Democrats are not anti gun and that they have no intentions of increasing gun control?

Is that your contention? 




 This is why no one believes you're a gun owner. 




 You. Are. Awesome 




 You are right. 

The Democratic Party fully supports gun rights. They have no intentions of restricting gun rights. 

The Democratic Party fully supports gun rights. They have no intentions of restricting gun rights.

 Not at all. The Democrat Party AKA Liberals have openly stated that they are anti gun.  It amuses me that you refute that.  




 If you believe the Democrat party is pro gun then there is nothing I can offer at this point. You must be leading a very blissful life.  




 No one is stopping you from offering proof. 




 http://yubanet.com/uploads/4/Planeten-Jorden.jpg 




 I don't know who David Klein is but your link authored by him is simply his uneducated opinion. Nothing more.


I assume he is referring to Goldberg's book "Liberal Fascism". The term Liberal Fascism was derived from a speech made by George Orwell in the 1930's. Goldberg's book of the same name is fully footnoted and extremely well researched. 

In that book, Goldberg describes the various versions of socialism that was being created and discussed around the early part of the 20th century. Naziism and Fascism were two  forms of socialism.

Hitler and Mussolini were both serious writers of socialist political philosophy and championed its use as a fairer system than capitalism. Each created a unique brand of socialism that they felt was better and fairer than the previous versions of socialism offered by others up til them.

Both systems retained the classical elements of standard socialism including non private ownership of thee means of production (and distribution), a planned economy, and a government/community centric society at the expense of individual freedom. Both also offered unique elements that only their form of socialism featured. 

I am sorry that you don't agree with historical fact. Some think that fire can't bend steel and that 9/11 was an inside job. If you wish to contest proven historical fact then please offer your own proof. Goldberg's book is full of footnotes. Can you refute any of them? 

To repeat an overused cliche, the truth hurts. The Nazis and the Fascists were true socialists. 

Never be afraid of the truth. Good luck 




 Actually, the Nazis and the fascists were both socialist movements. Hitler and Mussolini were prolific writers on socialism. This is historic fact. Some are confused by the fact that the Nazis were bitter enemies of the soviet Union and mistakenly assume that makes the Nazis and Fascists polar opposites to to Soviets 




 Actually, the Nazis were socialists so historically that is accurate. My previous comment merely stated how I felt sorry for you for you supporting a political philosophy that was determined to limit your civil rights. It shows how politically confused you are.  




 The rest of the educated world disagrees with you.  




 The naivete of Liberals never surprises me. The Left has always wanted to eliminate guns in private hands. You are like one of those Jews in the concentration camps who collaborated with the Nazis. Your position arises pathos in me for you rather than blowing my mind.  




 The Left can only thrive if it lies about itself and its opponents.  




  Most Americans don't want to wind the clock back before the 1940's.

No one has mentioned the 40's. All Conservatives want is smaller government, less taxes, less regulation. It is our contention that government is out of control. It expands every year in its scope, size, and influence in the people's lives. Power is a zero sum game. Power is finite. The bigger slice of the power pie that the government takes must come at the expense of the people's freedom and liberty. 

How can you possibly view these goals as extreme? I simply don't want politicians deciding for me how to live my life and control my destiny. 




 Where the Democrats want to take this country is diametrically opposed to where Conservatives want to take this country. Grid lock is not a bad think. Compromise is a death by a thousand paper cuts.

One simply has to look at where each party ultimately wants to take the country.

The Left, the Democrats want to march us towards a communal socialist state rule by a rigid, uncompromising ideology.

The right, the Conservatives want the US to have smaller government and less government interference in the people's lives. They want to follow the path of Jeffersonian Democracy. 




 Though from space it looks like a impact crater or the remnants of an ancient volcano, the Kondyor Massif, in Russia, is neither. Rather it is in what's known in geological terms as an "intrusion." An intrusion forms when molten magma of igneous rock crystallizes below the surface of the earth, in this case forming a perfectly circular rocky ring over a billion years ago. (Because they form underground, intrusions are also known as plutons, named for Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld.) Harder then the rest of the earth around it, the Kondyor Massif intrusion (in this case an alkaline-ultrabasic massif intrusion) has slowly made its way through 5000 miles of mantle and is now visible on the surface of the earth. A stream flows out from its center, fueled by the snow waters melting from the Kondyor Massif's 2000-foot-high rim. 




 Apparently for most redditors no 




 Wow dude. That's a big butt plug. 




 Marx wrote of a transition from capitalism via socialism into communism. The end game is ultimately community ownership of everything. Socialist theory has always stated such. Progress to the Left does not mean a general improvement of society or a fairer system. Progress means a march towards a specific, rigid, Leftist, ideology. 

Some assume Sweden or Norway like states are the goal of socialist societies. It is not. Those states are merely transitory, stepping stones along a path that ultimately leads to true and rigid socialism. 

  




 I disagree. Within the GOP we debate regarding issues such as legalization of pot, gay marriage, abortion, religion in government, immigration, taxation, size of government,  with several factions (Tea Party, establishment GOP, religious right, Libertarians, RINOs) all fighting for influence. 




 You are naive if you think the Democrats desire anything less than a total ban on most firearms. They would pass such a ban today if they thought they could get away with it.   




 Wrong. The Tea Party wants RINOs and fake establishment republicans gone. The TP desire less taxes, less regulation, and smaller government. That's it. Nothing radical at all. 

When dealing with the hard Left Democrat party, moderation is irrelevant. The Democrats want to fundamentally change the USA. We oppose that agenda. There can be no compromise.  




 The bullet got inserted into the case upside down. It will still fire just fine. Troops during WWI used to intentionally flip bullets and insert them upside down so when fired they would impact on steel plates and cause spauling on the other side of the plate. It was a means of killing soldiers hiding behind steel.   




 I listed true socialist states and not quasi socialist states that feature rich, homogenous populations, that feature some socialistic policies but are clearly not actual socialist states. Also those states can afford more socialist policies because the USA pays for their defense. Lets see socialism work in a poor country without coercion and violence. 




  Did you somehow miss the part where the Democratic party's philosophy is fundamentally at odds with socialism? I guess you did because I've already explained it.

All you said was the Dems are for tax cuts which they clearly oppose

If you think this, then you have literally never picked up a history textbook. Socialism has always been characterized, and in fact, requires, sudden and violent change.

You may want to reread your Marx comrade. I think you missed a few chapters. The process from capitalism to communism is a long march not a sudden violent explosion:

https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm

 




 What about economic issues? Taxes? 

Clearly neither socialism not the Democrat Party favors anti ethnic or anti sexual identity policies regardless of past transgressions. 

Today's Democrat Party is in lock step with all of the elements of classical socialism. 

Socialism is a long march towards a definite destination. At first there is a period where socialism exists along side capitalism. It exploits Capitalism and co-opts it. Rather than outright government/community ownership of the means of production, socialism at first controls industries via crony Capitalism and regulatory favoritism. Eventually, socialism evolves from a parasitic relationship with its Capitalist host and kills it and instilling all classical aspects of socialism (ultimately to communism) 




  Democrats are trying to fight for an increase in size of the traditional middle class. This is not something that socialism supports - socialism supports classless society.

What policies specifically?

Tax cuts for the middle class. Socialism would not support tax cuts, period.

Absolute and total lie. Name Any tax cut proposed by the Democrats

Tax-cuts for small businesses. Socialism supports large state-owned companies, not small businesses.

Absolute and total lie. Name Any tax cut proposed by the Democrats

Pro-immigration reform. Socialism does not jive with multicultural societies.

Immigration reform is designed only to create dependent Democrat voting block. As for multiculturalism, no such limitations are a part of any socialist ideology except for Naziism. Isn't Cuba multicultural?

LGBT rights. Again, socialist countries across the world have pretty much never encouraged this, to the point at which you could be punished.

Socialism dictates no such restrictions on sexual identity except for the Nazis

Freedom of speech. Also isn't supported by socialism

There is no debate within the Democrat Party. Ever been to a college campus? Dissenting opinions/viewpoints are forbidden and routinely shouted down or silenced as hate speech, micro aggressions etc

 




 No, the Tea Party wants the RINOs out. 




 Such as? 




 You are confusing traditional liberalism as practiced via Jeffersonian democracy. Over the latter part of the 20th century, liberalism was co-opted by the Left. It no longer means open to new ideas and personal freedom. Today it mean a rigid and static path towards classical, ideological socialism. Ever notice why there is NO debate regarding policy within the Democrat party? It is ideologically rigid with no acceptance of any competing messages or policies. 




 Modern day Liberalism is merely one path to the ultimate end game of true, in practice socialism. Liberalism is a form of socialism whereby American culture and traditions are destroyed and replaced by socialist policies. 

In essence, Liberalism is a transitory phase of socialism but it is indeed socialism. 

 




 I know what the word means. Socialism is an economic and political philosophy characterized by non private ownership of the means of production, a planned economy, and a government or community centric society at the expense of personal freedom.

Key socialistic governments have existed in the Soviet Union, Maoist China, Castro's Cuba, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, the Nazis, and Mussolini's Fascist Italy to name a few.

  




 Someone of YOUR income would not be invited to eat there. It does matter.  




 Liberal used to mean open to new ideas and free thinking. The term has been co-opted by the hard Left and now means something very different: Hardcore socialist. 




 So you are saying that income inequality does not matter and should not be a political issue?

 I beat you fair and square in a debate on fracking. I provided too many facts and you wilted under the pressure and quit.

Today, truth won out over religion. 




 Please provide proof that fracking causes ground water pollution. Fracking has been used for nearly 100 years. It has a great safety record. The only danger is rare cases of tiny leaks caused by equipment failure. These rare cases release the same amount of oil as a vehicle crash and a fuel tank rupture. 

Seriously, if you reject the scientific facts of fracking then you oppose it for religious reasons. If so, I believe you have the right to belong to any faith based belief system you choose but don't try to force everyone else to join also. I am an atheist and I don't want to join anyone's religion. Even if it is Gaia based environmentalism.

 Well failures are rare. They typically involve defects in the well shaft casing. Any leakage of anything is quickly discovered via a drop in pressure in the well. Ground water and the fracking chemicals and gas and oil produced are separated by thousands of feet of earth and many layers of impermeable shale.

Thus, the only way for anything to contaminate water is via a defect in the pumping equipment or defect in the well casing. Such defects can be quickly fixed. 

  




 Be the mature one, visit her and make peace. She can't harm you while she is alive anymore but you may regret it someday if you don't.  




 Wow! Uranus is huge! 




 Actually, when I took graduate level chemistry classes I learned that fracking chemicals are injected thousands of feet away from ground water separated  by many layers of impermeable shale . I also learned that the fracking chemicals react with iron compounds in the earth and convert the chemicals into iron oxide AKA rust.  




 Hitler was a capitalist? Not even close. Hitler was an avowed and committed socialist.  

http://www.stephenhicks.org/2009/12/04/economic-socialism-not-capitalism-section-8-of-nietzsche-and-the-nazis/

 'non privately held means of production', that's redundant.

I was pointing out that at various stages of socialist theory, the means of production are owned or controlled by the state and then ultimately by the community (and likely administered by the state for the community). I was not being redundant. 
 




 I agree the various socialistic systems seek to achieve the same end game via differing paths but they all end up at the same destination ultimately. That is a planned economy,  non privately held means of production and distribution (whether held by "the community" or by government), and a government (or community) centric society at the expense of personal freedom.

 As for fascism, that and Naziism were true socialist ideologies. You listed some of the unique elements of their brand of socialism but you fail to acknowledge their commonality with "classical" socialism. Fascism and Naziism featured no private ownership of the means of production (and distribution), a planned economy,  and a government (or community) centric society at the expense of personal freedom. 

Socialism is a family tree that shares the same roots 




 Anti fracking is anti science. Liberals are hypocrites.  




  reform socialism like seen in most of Europe and Canada

I disagree. There is no such thing as reform socialism. Socialism has many forms (communism, progressivism, Naziism, fascism, anarcho syndicalism, etc). Each form has distinct differences that can be considered distinct paths towards an end goal. The end goal for all systems is ultimately the same.  




 Please reread the article. It claims that water levels have risen an average of 3mm per year during winter storms only. The sea levels have not risen and remained higher. As an East coast property owner, I have made careful measurements of sea levels at my own home and have observed NO increase of any kind.

 Anything is possible so that is why we must use the scientific method to prove truth and falsehood. Are you opposed to continuing experimentation on climate science?  




 So you are saying that scientist understand all climate systems and can model them with at least 50% accuracy? 




 No denial whatsoever. We just think the science has been corrupted by politics. Lets test and experiment and discover the truth wherever that may take us.. 




 If you say so... 




  He used the socialist title to as gimmick to attract followers.

Proof?

The fact is that during the late 19th and early 20th centuries many political philosophers were trying to formulate the most equitable form of socialism. Among these were Communism, Fascism, Naziism, even Anarcho Syndicalism (of Monte Python Holy Grail fame) and several others. All of these forms of socialism maintain the standard elements of classical socialism such as non private ownership of the means of production, a planned economy, and a government centric society at the expense of individual liberty. All of these forms of socialism also featured important differences such as Communism's international focus or Naziism's extreme racism. 

The study of socialism is an interesting exploration of political philosophers attempting to find the best and most equitable way to organize a society's government and economy. Sadly some of those offshutes resulted in evil regimes and systems.

All of this is well documented. I really can't grasp how you can even challenge these facts other than you feel uncomfortable that the system you favor now has some unsavory relatives in the family tree.

Arguing about this is like you trying to claim Bill Clinton wasn't a Democrat. 

I really don't know what else to say. A lot of people get confused by socialism and the Nazis because during WWII the Soviets were at war with them. Some assume that because the Soviets were against the Nazis that the Nazis must have been political polar opposites. Confusion also comes from the creation of the whole Left wing Right wing political spectrum of the French Parliament and where various politicians sat. People incorrectly assume that the spectrum of the French Parliament at the time represents the entirety of the international political spectrum we have today. 

In other words what was considered far Right or far Left in the French Parliament then is not necessarily what we would consider as being far Right or Far Left today.

Again, I don't know how you could even argue this historical fact. I suggest you take some college level political science and history classes. Being ignorant or intentionally misinformed will not serve you in life.

Good luck 




 That would explain their sexual habits 




 Hitler viewed the Communists and other socialist groups as competitors for the same power goal. He disliked Communism because of its international focus and high Jewish membership.

Simply because he and Mussolini were socialists does not make then automatically like other socialists or any other political group. 

I really don't know why you are fighting this fact so much. It's an historical fact. There is no debate here. 




 Sorry but the Nazis and Fascists were both socialists. 

"The truth is incontrovertible, malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end; there it is." -Winston Churchill

 




 Sorry but the Nazis were the German National Socialist Worker's party. Hitler was a prolific socialist writer and philosopher. He rejected Communism because he felt it was too slow and contained too many Jews. The Nazis' social, economic, and political policies were main stream socialism. 

High taxation merely takes money away from productive job creators and gives it to government which usually squanders it on wasteful projects. You are assuming that the country thrived during high taxation periods as being the cause for economic expansion. 

You really need to get a basic education. You will never succeed living off of false assumptions and silly slogans. The world just doesn't work that way. 




 You are mistakenly attributing any "good" or beneficial policy with a being Progressive policy. 

What do you think the end game of progressivism is? Ultimately, will we or won't we end up in a socialist state? Be honest.  




 The Tea Party wants LIMITED taxation not NO taxation.

It is an historical fact that the Nazis and the Fascists were socialists. Your definition in no way contradicts that except its incorrect claim that Fascism was "Right Wing".

The false claim that the Nazis and Fascists were right wing comes from WWII when the Soviets were at war with them. The Soviets and the Nazis and Fascists were all socialists but different, competing forms. 

Again, please take some survey classes in political science at your local community college.  




 Simply put, the EPA is supposed to enforce environmental laws that have been approved by Congress and signed into law by the president.

The EPA instead constantly expands their influence by creating law under the rubric of environmental protection. They do so without regard for the economic effects of those regulations. They do so without legal authority to do so (can't create statutes). Their policies destroy entire industries (see coal, nuclear, etc}. 

BTW Barnes cartridges are 3x as expensive as lead based cartridges are. Biofuel is available. It is more expensive than diesel or gasoline. Why aren't YOU driving a bio fuel car? Why isn't YOU home heated with biofuel? Hypocrite

 




 I am not against all regulation. I am against the endless expansion of regulation. Case in point: During the 70's the EPA created very helpful regulations on clean water and pollution. Since then, they have attempted to regulate anything even remotely relating to the environment.

These new regulations are very expensive to comply with, they are of dubious and often no value to the environment, the new regulations don't take into account economic impacts when imposed, the EPA oversteps into areas that should be regulated by congress, the EPA regulations often involve political or philosophical agendas rather than environmental protection.

Just this week, a judge ruled that the EPA can't regulate lead bullets. If the EPA had been allowed to do that then they would have unilaterally infringed on the people's 2nd amendment rights.   

 




 Tea Party is not against ALL taxation, it is against endlessly raising taxes so government can endlessly expand and regulate. Please stop misquoting the Tea Party's goals 




 Forcing everyone into socialized health care to provide medical services is like  forcing everyone into public housing projects to solve housing challenges. 




 Socialism is a political and economic system characterized by having a planned economy, where the government controls the means of production in a government centric society at the expense of individual goals and freedom.

Fascism (and Naziism) were both forms of socialism. Not in just name but in goals and in practice. I strongly suggest you attend some college courses before you continue to discuss political science.   




 Me 




 Huh? What are you talking about? 




 No, the Tea Party stands for lower taxes, smaller government, and less regulation. It is about making government have a smaller impact on the people's lives and giving the people greater freedom.

Your list is a simplistic infantilization of the Tea Party's goals. We view the progressive Left as false prophets of the poor and the middle class. The Left's goal is only socialism, plain and simple.  




 I can assure you that the Tea Party will oppose any progressive legislation proposed by ANY politician of any sex or race. Why is it so hard to grasp that we oppose the policies. The Left's political ideology is diametrically opposed to our political philosophy. We believe progressivism is not simply a desire to make things better but rather a rigid path towards socialism and ruin for the US. It's that simple. The Left lies and claims that race is involved.

 is Obama a Marxist, Communist, Socialist, or Fascist? Can't be all of them

All of the political systems named above are socialist systems so Obama indeed could be a Marxist/Communist or a fascist.  




 No, I am saying that the gas/oil industries have been fracking for almost 100 years and that any pollutants that get injected deep underground quickly turn into iron oxide AKA rust and are totally harmless and have never caused ground water pollution. Science 




  you are against anything labeled "progressive" even if it works

Please tell me what progressive policies work? 




 Please provide proof. If it is so obvious then finding proof sould be easy...

Crickets? 




 No, Democrats assume they are of normal intelligence 




 As a Tea Party Conservative I can say that I am opposed to almost every "progressive" policy proposed by anyone. The insinuation that the GOP is opposing Obama simply because he is black is  completely false.  




 Fracking has been done for almost 100 years.  




 http://i.imgur.com/qrpS6vX.gif 




 The people opposed to fracking are opposed to it for philosophical reasons that are independent from any factual basis. Even if fracking (or any other fossil fuel technology) were 100% completely safe and risk free, they would oppose it.  




 Leftists never debate facts, they only shoot the messenger 




 You obviously do not understand what Atwater was saying. He was saying that the GOP could attract disillusioned Dixiecrat voters with economic appeals rather than racist appeals. 

You really need to see the interview again and really try to grasp what was said.

Please also read this link. http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2013/04/the-southern-strategy-debunked-again.php 




 Can you offer proof that the current GOP is racist?  




 So we both agree that the GOP is no more racist than the Democrat Party. 




 The Southern Strategy has been proven false. The migration of southern democrat voters did not happen suddenly as a result of the civil rights act being passed. The migration was a decades long process due to the Democrat Party turning left and moving away from American values.

There is no evidence whatsoever that the GOP adopted racism or embraced racism.

  




 Democrats supported slavery, started the KKK, supported segregation, initiated Jim Crow Laws, opposed the civil rights act.  




 Damn Democrats and their Jim Crow laws. 




 After the volcano on Krakatoa exploded in 1883, Muslims there attacked and killed non Muslims. Muslims have attacked and killed thousands of people in countries all over the world. It seems as if the problem is not happenstance or environmental. The problem seems to be institutional and cultural. My issue is that you and others that think like you simply can't recognize or accept that all cultures, religions, peoples are not the same.    




 all the horrors in the world are committed by people through pure happenstance 

Please read what you just wrote. Can you seriously believe that? 

If you were to honestly view the history of Muslim extremists motivated to intentionally kill in the name of their religion, you would see that happenstance has had nothing to do with those acts.

 




 Thanks! 




 I am reading his book "Gulag Archipelago". I could not find a better cite. I am looking for the actual page number now.   




 I tire of people like you who simply cannot distinguish/differentiate/discriminate between the actions of two groups of people and feel the need to place both groups in the same moral basket. The USA and the Nazis killed thousands of people during WWII but they did so for different reasons. They are not two sides of the same coin.

 Muslim extremists have been engaging in terrorist and violent acts for centuries and against every culture they interact with. Islam is a religion based on conquest and subjugation of their rivals. Radical Islamists have been involved in thousands of religious based violent attacks in just the past 20 years. http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/index.html#Attacks (follow links to yearly lists)

The only reason the US is engaged in violent action against Muslim extremists is because they simply won't leave us alone. They have already declared war against us unilaterally. 

According to your logic, a robber who enters a store and shoots a clerk and the store owner who defends himself and shoots the robber are moral equivalents because they were both shooters engaged in violence.

If you cannot see the difference between the two or the difference between what the US does and what Muslim extremists do then you are indeed being juvenile and naive and engaged in wishful thinking.  




 No because you are replacing critical thought, logical analysis, cause and effect with juvenile wishful thinking.  




 Yes. Naive and silly 




 You are a despicable, simplistic person.  




 This being reddit, I am surprised no one has made a snarky response such as "It is your wife. Pic taken at Motel 6 down by the interstate"

 I have no idea what you are trying to say. I assume you misunderstood my previous comment 




  one could argue that, in general, conservatives only disagree on how quickly we should approach fascism

Fascism was a socialist political movement. I highly doubt many on the right would push for such a system.

Also the Democrat Party is being led to its ultimate path towards real socialism. Everyday Democrat voters are being falsely led to believe that the party only seeks an general progress towards a better future. 




  legitimizing torture and killings without due process

Obama can end this today. He supports drone killing without due process (I personally agree with his policy)

 restricting choices and education concerning reproduction

The abortion statutes in the EU are much more restrictive than the USA. (I personally don't give a shit about abortion either way)

invading other countries to steal their natural resources

Can you offer any proof that that has happened? Ever?

restricting human rights to only exist for whites and/or christian

Can you offer any proof that that has happened? Ever?

putting people in prison for what they do to their own bodies.

If you are referring to drugs, both parties have supported the war on drugs for a century

I don't like the world-conquest size of the defence budget, the complete neglect of how we are rapidly destroying the planet

The US defense budget keeps sea lanes open allowing world commerce. The US guarantees the security of the EU, Canada, and many other countries in the world. When there is a natural disaster, it is the US military that always offers assistance. 

Can you name a country that is a better steward of the environment?   




 Your definition of Liberalism is the traditional one such as could be used to describe JFK. Today Liberalism is simply a path towards a socialist end game. Notice how the left never has any disagreements on policy? Everyone on the Left is following a strict, static, rigid ideology. The only debates I see on the Left is an occasional debate regarding gun control and a debate on how fast we should proceed down the path towards socialism.

On the right there are many debates and factions such as Establishment GOP, RINO's, Libertarians, Tea Party Conservatives 




 disposed to preserve existing conditions, institutions, etc., or to restore traditional ones, and to limit change.

Yes as in the presence of government in our lives. I want less government, lower taxes, less regulation. The correct definition is a rolling back of most Liberal policies of the past 40 years. Most, not all. 




 Very naive of you to say that. I am a Tea Party Conservative and I reject everything the left favors. I view them as a cancer on the country and will resist every policy they hope to implement. Why do I oppose the Left so vehemently? Because their policies differ so much from the Right's   




 Progressivism and socialism are merely different paths to the same destination. Ultimately both lead to a world controlled by self appointed elites that know better than you do how you should live your life.  




 Can you please tell me what the end game of progressivism is? Is it or isn't it ultimately socialism? 




 You and other Liberals make the same mistake of confusing what political parties actually stand for.

Progressives are not promoting a general progression towards a better world. Progressivism is a strict, methodical march towards garden variety socialism. The end result is a society run by self appointed elites.

Conservatism is not an attempt to conserve tradition or the past. Conservatism is the desire to keep government small because as government expands, the personal liberty and freedom of the people must necessarily be limited.   




 No clue what you are referring to. Conservatives only want the government to tax us less, spend less, and be less of a nanny state 




 False, I attended a Dave Bratt  (he beat Eric Cantor) function there and the religious people I met were polite and respectful. They are religious, good for them. I am an atheist, good for me. We all got along just fine. No bibles, no snake handling, no drinking of strictnine. 




 That's how they serve chocolate milk 




 He made no comments regarding gay marriage so you really can't claim to know what position he would take. Both Obama and Hillary were against gay marriage a couple of years ago. 

As a Tea Party Conservative, I don't care who marries who.

Jefferson invaded Libya and kept US Marines there for several years

War on drugs has been pursued by both parties for 100 years. Obama could end it today if he so desired. 

 




 I am a hardcore Tea Party Conservative and I don't give a shit who you marry. I grew up middle class and have been poor in my life. I got educated and started my own business. Even when I was poor I still rejected the Progressive message because I knew that Progressivism was a fraud. It was not a path towards a general betterment of society but rather a specific march towards socialism and government control over the people by self proclaimed elites. 

 




 The GOP is made up of many factions: Establishment RINOs, Tea Party Conservatives, Libertarians, Religious Right etc. The Religious right make up only 10% of the party. I have no friction with the religious right other than thinking they may be a distraction from our core message of limited taxation and less governmental control over the people.

I feel the bigger problem is the Left's disingenuous claims and outright lies regarding the GOP as being religious racists. I am a hardcore Tea Party Conservative who is active in politics and I simply never encounter the intolerant bible thumpers and racist/homophobic/misogynistic  types the Left always claims makes up the Right.

 




 Why do Liberals view the Right as evil? We on the right are not evil or insincere or anti anyone. We simply reject progressive socialist policy and embrace a more traditional Jeffersonian philosophy.  




 I did not know you were a mod for r/politics. Don't get mad at me for pointing out that she is nothing special and just another corrupt politician. Don't we have enough of those in DC as it is? 




 Hirsch may be a marketing genius. Sort of a reverse marketing campaign. I bet many people would pay him to never make that movie, me included.  




 I never made any comments on her article. Please stop trying to change the subject which is Elizabeth Warren's history and pattern of dishonesty and placing her goals above the people's needs.  




 It's not Ad hominem because it is not simply a meaningless attack of Warren for being a bitch. It is a criticism of a necessary requirement for leadership. I demand all leaders be trustworthy and not place their goals ahead of the people's needs. 

Warren has a documented history of lying. Even her husband lied about being a Native American too. 

Please look at this chart:

This is the relative Warren claimed made her Native American. As you can see her claim is a total fabrication.

 She lied about being a Native American. When exposed she tried to cover it up. She plagiarized a book called "Powwow Chow" 




 I am commenting on the FACT that Elizabeth Warren is a liar and unfit to be a leader. She has a history of dishonesty and plagiarism.

 According to the US Government Printing Office, the US tax code is 16,845 pages long. I don't know about you but I view that as grossly excessive. Those regs apply to someone.... 




  It is human nature that most people and corporations will seek to pay the least amount of taxes. Even if revenues stay the same, there is a benefit from making the paying of taxes fair and easy.

The tax system as it stands today is too complex and politically abusive.  




  Taxes are ridiculously low in this country especially if you're a person who invests.

http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/services/tax/tax-tools-and-resources/pages/corporate-tax-rates-table.aspx

(USA taxes are highest in the world) 




 How do we collect taxes made overseas today? How do other countries handle that? Obviously this is not an impossible task.  




 Brain food. Literally  




  Defining the price of intellectual property is notoriously difficult

Difficult does not equal impossible.

B is overseas. Are you saying we'll tax overseas subsidiaries of US companies?

Companies will always flock to lower tax havens ( see recent Burger King/Tim Horton's merger). 

If the US has lower tax rates then companies will migrate more operations here. 

Compare what US companies pay in taxes today with the current tax code vs a proposed flat tax of 15% and how international income is taxed. 




 Any increase in gross income generated would be taxable. Companies could play any accounting games they wished but if income increased then that amount would be subject to the flat tax. 

A sells off it's intellectual property to B

Difference between base cost and sale price is taxable income.

B rents back it's intellectual property to A for an amount of money equal to what A's gross revenue would otherwise be

Rent received is taxable income 




 Everyone (people and all business structures including trusts and non profits) pays 15% on gross income from all sources derived. No deductions, exceptions, or loopholes.  




 Blind people can't physically see a school test. Are you saying that poor people have a physical impediment from paying the same relative percentage of their income as other classes? 




 So you think the poor are not as capable as the richer classes? 




 So you are against equitable taxation? You are against everyone paying their fair share? You only want income redistribution comrade?

 Consider a law that required every person and corporation to pay a flat tax of say 15%. No deductions, no loopholes, no other procedures. Wouldn't that be a fairer and cheaper way to collect taxes?

We need to collect taxes. That is fine. It's the method of collection that leads to abuse and inequity  




 Boogie nights....and days 




 Way too many stores would sell feminine hygiene products 




 Lou Gehrig died of Lou Gehrig's disease.

How did he not see that coming? 




 In many third world countries, toilet paper is dropped at the side of the toilet and collected each day to be burned   




 Taxes are ok. It's the IRS and its politically driven bullying I dislike.


"You don't need Mussolini to make the trains run on time"

 




 How could anyone not want to cripple the IRS? 




 Can you offer any proof that the Kochs control the Tea Party? You need to stop dealing in things you wish were true and start incorporating facts into your interpretation of reality.

#BestLaughAllDay   

Don't laugh. Offer proof.

Let me offer proof that George Soros is the financial controller of the political Left in the US and controls the Democrat party:

http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=977

Now, dispute these facts if you can. The educated debate. Fools just laugh.

Also, the difference between Soros and the Kochs is that Soros thinks he has it too easy ~ that he's not being asked for enough, while the Kochs use their money and influence to further the idea that they are asked too much.

Can you see the difference?

I have no clue what you are even saying or asking.

I bet you Jesus could!

I am an atheist so I don't have a clue what Jesus believed  




  Reagan started a war on unions in his first year in office

War? He fired a bunch of PATCO union air traffic controllers because they were not legally allowed to strike and they did so anyway.

And what is with Liberals and the Kochs? I am a Tea Party Conservative and the Kochs have no influence on anything. They are rich guys who make donations. Good for them. I bet you think Soros and Steyer are just concerned citizens and deserve a pass. They don't use their money to buy elections and influence legislation do they?

 




 You are 100% wrong. The only portion of the middle class that the New Deal created was from hiring government bureaucracy employees.

May I suggest you read a book on US History? Your knowledge on the subject is based on Liberal ideology and not historical fact.  




 "Records show Roberson has been arrested several times in the past for robbery, burglary and theft. According to the preliminary report, Gould and Roberson are from California. The report states a search warrant was obtained for Robersons vehicle. Police said they found a stolen bracelet, two handguns, bloody clothes, a bus ticket from Los Angeles to Fort Smith, and a black duffle bag containing duct tape." 




 Saying that the New Deal created the middle class is just about the silliest thing I have heard in a long time. In most human societies, the merchant class created the middle class. The New Deal created two types of jobs: some manual labor, low paying jobs and government employee jobs.

It was WWII industrial production and expansion that brought the US out of the Depression. It was industrial and business expansion that expanded the middle class.


Your example proved my point exactly. Thank you. 




 Democrat economics in a nutshell involves the government stimulating consumer consumption by giving money to the public sector via building projects, public agencies, or simply handouts. 

Conservative economics in a nutshell is to make the cost of doing business less via tax cuts and less regulatory expense. When businesses have more money they will stimulate the economy by expanding and increased hiring.

The Democrat method helps unions and special interest groups and works only so long as the money is flowing.

The Conservative method is superior because lower costs for business creates sustainable economic stimulus.
 
To paraphrase an old saying: Democrat economics is like giving a man a fish and allowing him to eat for a day. Conservative economics is like teaching a man how to fish so he can eat everyday.  




 I travel extensively throughout the Southern US and most people are middle class. You really need to get out more often and not rely on your own prejudices. 

EU can afford a lot of socialist policies because the US provides military security for them. They also rely on Germany to support the poor countries such as Portugal, Spain, Ireland, and Greece. 




 The Left only offers "solutions" that result in higher taxes and empowerment of elites. They NEVER offer anything else.  




 Thomas Jefferson used to be called a liberal because he was open to new ideas and was a pragmatist. Today the term Liberal only means a slavish adherence to Leftist ideology. The open mindedness and the pragmatism have completely vanished from Liberalism.  




 Do you really believe that? JFK was about where George W Bush was in domestic policy and in foreign policy. 




 The Left is simply extreme Marxism.  




 Well, we didn't find any firearms but we did find a 1998 copy of "Juggs" magazine in the garage. We are placing you on our internet deviant watch list so that your neighbors can be warned about a sexual predator in their midst.  




 Often simply wrapping a wart infected area with duct tape and keeping it on for a few weeks will irritated the area enough to engage your body's immune system to react and destroy the wart. 




 Yes. The US has still not recovered from Obama's recession to this day  




 Only fools and the easily led believe the economy is in good shape. We have not recovered from the Obama recession. Good jobs for college graduates are scarce. Workers have given up hope.

Here is the labor participation rate: http://www.zerohedge.com/article/labor-force-participation-rate-drops-25-year-low-645

Please explain how it is a good thing that the rate is at a 25 year low? 




 Are you saying that the 90 million people not in the workforce retired during the Obama administration? 




 Do Liberals really believe that the Democrats are creating jobs? The number of Americans who are even participating in the job market has declined in every month since Obama became president. 




 Then Neo-Cons like the folks at this rag will have one less apparatus to wield their many, anti-choice policies.

What does that even mean?  




 Can you offer ANY proof that what you claim is anything more than just the rant of a psychopath? 




 These miniature helicopters are tiny, being 10x2.5 cm (4x1 inch) aircraft that are battery powered, very quiet and can stay in the air for 20 minutes per sortie. The rotor diameter is 12 cm (4.8 inches). The UAV is made of hard plastic and one can be ready for action in less than a minute. A complete set (two UAVs and the controller) weighs less than a kilogram (2.2 pounds). The operator can see (and capture) video and still photos on the hand held controller as the operator sends the PD-100 up to a kilometer away. The operator can zoom the camera. The PD-100 also carries GPS, a thermometer, compass and altitude sensor. Max speed is 10 meters a second (36 kilometers/22.5 miles an hour) and max altitude is about 500 meters. 




 She is such a horrible person with no redeeming qualities.  




 You are a Liberal. I am still 10x as smart as you are 




 IMO an 11 year old that does not speak is a win/win for everybody 




 She is not a credible source. The families know that Obama and Hillary let those people die for political reasons. They then tried to cover their asses with that lame lie about a video being the cause.   




 Not true. Can you provide links? 




 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringwoodite 




 Yes like baby teeth. Didn't your parents place your discarded baby toes under your shoes at night for the foot fairy to replace with colorful pairs of socks? 




 The families of all of the  Americans who died in Benghazi might disagree with the author. They fault Obama and Hillary for a failed policy, failed reaction, and disgusting coverup to protect political asses.
