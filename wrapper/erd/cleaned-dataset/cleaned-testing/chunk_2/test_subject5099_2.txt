 You sir, are a genius! I think it is pretty balanced if so, because killing a witch is pretty difficult if it poisons you, and they are pretty rare.

 From this comments time, it is in an hour and 30 minutes. 




 23:00 UTC
 




 Its not up D: 




 Teams of -99* :P
 




 Is the message can't resolve host name or Can't Reach server? also the "(MPMG)" part is not part of the IP. 




 You messed up more than that buddy, the format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC and this is not an impromptu... 




 Well, that's how they are, yes, they do need to be nerfed, but the host cannot do that, if he decides to disable glowstone than so be it. 




 Nether is 1.6 isn't it? 




 Does it say teams or allies? No? Then no. 




 Hopefully, all went well except that the whitelist should have been cut off at the time you got twenty, and that you should have pregened. 




 YAY :D 




 Can you give us the direct IP, the one with the numbers? 




 Hopefully you can, but "trolling" doesn't give a good impression of you as a host. 




 Fun for you and whoever kills you, we would have all been killed by that one guy, thats not fun, imo, and once again, I didn't play your game... 




 Check you chat logs dude, I only ever said the F-Bomb, I never called you a cunt, the pinata thing was out of hand though, they were never a set of stuff that automatically made you win, just boosts...
 




 You can do better, but your assistant host, cannot, he has no better judgement and should have left it as an ffa, not a "kill me and you win" game, because that gear was too op. 




 It would have been fine if you used better judgement and known that the person that killed you would have won no matter what, your hosting skills can be improved on, but the pinata thing was the worst idea I've ever heard. Almost like Gammex, and that's pretty bad. I didn't get to play anyway, you banned me... 




 DO NOT EVER PLAY THIS GUYS GAMES...
Even for his first game, this is wildly unacceptable, he did not pregen or cut off the whitelist, leading to 30 minutes of trying to kick people to lower the player count. Then, the game was changed to FFA due to issues, (which is fine), however, then the host made himself "a walking pinata" with a sharp V sword and full diamond. I said that this was F-ing Stupid, and to that, he said, that this was a "random game" when infact it was a Reddit To2, not an FFA by some nitwit, even though thats what it ended up being. Do not play in this hosts games, unless you want to waste your time. 




 Swyrnd and test_subject5099 




 Hi, my name is nether rush, and I killed 4 people in 30 seconds! 




 WOO! 




 If you didn't notice, you can log in now! 




 This usually isnt how this works out, but sometimes it just doesnt work out :/ 




 Hope you do well :D 




 Practice your pvp overall, and start with an FFA, learn the basics, maybe some tactics, and listen to what some people say in chat, because while sometimes it is really annoying things that arent relevant, sometimes it is helpful. Keep the mentality too at the start of the game, that you will only have 10 hearts, and thats it.

And remember, baby zombies will eat your face, skellies have aimbot, and that the nether is over-powered. 




 Yeah, I know, I wanted to play too :/ 




 Cmon man it says the max is 30 players :/ Please tell me you didnt start early :/ 




 You already start? It was never specified when you opened and I'd like to play :( 




 Well, it says Vanilla in the title, but No mobs and Perma-day are not Vanilla :3 




 My PC doesn't work with ips of this sort, do you have the number form of the IP?
 




 nether enabled?
 




 Not the only one man, mine was the same way. 




 Please host adc, Brindle's game is home hosted...
 




 3:15 UTC is 11:15 EDT, the server opens at 11:00 EDT  




 Nether enabled this time? 




 GG, that win was a bit cheaty, but we killed so many in the portal. Thank you swyrnd for helping me win! 




 Man, you have to pregen, otherwise it will take an eternity to start the game. 




 What about the nether? Is its terrain 1.7.3 generated? 




 If I don't have potions: 1. Pick 2. Sword 3. Bow 4. Water Bucket 5. F S 6. Lava Bucket 7. Food 8. Blocks 9. Torches or Gapples

If I have potions I just remove blocks, Lava, and F S for pots and such, and my inventory itself is put accordingly to my hotbar, like arrows above bow or tools above the pick. 




 YES, my favorite gamemode! 




 Why thank you, even if i did lose, it was a completely fair final fight, but as it seems, Strength 1 vs. 10 dogs (I had the strength) is not good if you have no lava. 




 Can we get some clarification as to what is going on with this tournament, because it seems like game 2 is not happening without any reason why. 




 Unfortunately I cannot make this particular match, but all other matches in this tournament I should be able to make :) 




 I would not recommend playing this host's games, very early in the match he started an event that caused rain to do damage, with no notification on this post that that would happen. When anyone would say anything about this, he would reply "quit yo bitchin" completely disregarding anything said. Do not play a game from this host if you wish to pvp, and not hide in caves from an event we were not notified of. 




 Should be open, Its 10 minutes before start... 




 This opens in 45 minutes from when I replied to you... 




 Yeah, it should be open, but its not... 




 Why hello there, I'm test_subject5099 (I prefer JT personally), and I've been around since May 2013. I personally love the competition, and play a lot of  FFAs, but team games are always fun (I prefer random teams games over chosen, but that's just me.). Always have fun, and remember, pots are op, and enchantments first!  




 For future reference: 4:30 UTC is actually 12:30 EDT 




 Is there a chance you would allow solos? 




 Better hope that skeleton is on the left or right side of your screen! 




 When does it open?
 




 We over at /r/ultrahardcore have a very similar idea, where we have the "Golden Head". Simply craft a golden apple but instead of the apple use a player head and heal 4 hearts! This encourages pvp and gives strategy to how much gold you should keep on your person. 




 Yeah, got second :( what is your IGN anyway?
 




 hopefully I won't die with potions this time! 




 Don't worry, I died with pots yesterday, so you should definitely be able to kill me :) 




 I will murder you all 3 




 ICEEEEEEEEEEEEE, I totally will play this :)

 




 Yes
