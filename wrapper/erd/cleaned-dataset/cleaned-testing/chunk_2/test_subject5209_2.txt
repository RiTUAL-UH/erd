 What I meant by the proposed question was like:  
  
What if Rick died instead of Shane in the field?  What if Andrea got bitten, instead of Amy?  Carol, instead of T-Dog?  
  
They would still have the bonding over time, just as different people.
 




 Pardon the possibly bad grammar in the title - English is my first language.  Anywho...

Who would be in which role in the "new" group?  Where would they be?  Would they be a better group of hardened survivors than the group we have now? 




 Not knowing what kind of man he is, that could be a good choice...but looks can be deceiving, can't they? 




 Very well thought out and a good choice. Bravo. 




 Why? Because that's the question that I asked, mother dick. :) 




 Too soon, man.

It's a good thing my job doesn't have a revolving door entrance. I'd have a nervous breakdown as soon as I got in the middle. 




 Maybe freckledfuck can see a lot about a person just by looking at them. A hell of a lot, apparently... 
























 That gray shoe that comes in from the right at 01:56 has some serious grip. 




 Sounds like the beginning of a [drumline](http://i.imgur.com/zb0EgkN.jpg) beat.  




 Don't be a perv like me, and pause at 1:03. 









 That's pretty fast for a reindeer. Usually they just hoof it. 




 And when the odometer reaches 80085...you can post it here again. 




 ...but only periodically. 




 If I were you...I would call that my Pity Party, not invite anyone else, and eat everything while binge watching The Walking Dead. 




 I would give up the right to marry.  I'm not doing that shit again. 




 Snap, Crackle, Pop 




 I'd like to do the same thing, but my wife doesn't like "comic movies", so I would have to do it all by me onesies.  Oy.  It sucks not having friends that are into comics and such as much as I am. 









 This gif is making me thirsty...

 Where did prostitution get thrown in the mix?

 Edit: Source - my back is itching like crazy and I'm in the break room, surrounded by dudes.

 I like how at 1:46 in, you can watch the ink bleed from a dark blue to a lighter shade in each individual letter.  That made the video for me. 




 Alexandra Daddario is the only reason I will watch this...when it comes out on Netflix in 2 years. 




 What would you do if your son was at home - crying all alone on the bedroom floor cause he's hungry - and the only way to feed him is to sleep with a man for a little bit of money? 














 Exactly. 









 He was in Django Unchained? I don't remember that. 




 Actually, I just finished watching The Lazarus Effect. 









 That's why I said "probably".  Gotta cover my arse. ;) 




 In the last one, they should've had a white guy get into the tanning bed...and a black guy get out. 




 Present. 









 Edit: Unless you use the metric system.  Good call. 




 Especially since they are so clever.  The females, anyway. 




 I'm thinking it's going to be a weapon used by Ulysses Klaw. 




 Not sure if I should upvote, downvote, or do neither of those.
  
*Up* - Pro: You can have one of them sweet internet points.  Con: That might put it in your head that I agree with your daredevil style of crossing the street.  
  
*Down* - Pro: You could look at me as a responsible person who cares about your well-being.  Con: That might make you spin into a severe depression tornado that not even the rebooted Superman could survive.  
  
*Neither* - that is just turning a blind eye to the issue.  

You call it. 




 Sorry, not enough Megan Fox in this to be directed by Michael Bay. 




 That cat is going to have trust issues meow. 




 Spring break, man. 




 Shut up. 




 I need this book and any other book you write! Awesome! 




 My birthday is early in September and I arrived late, so I think I was a Thanksgiving zygote.

Pass the stuffing.

 For me...cold weather school delays.  As a kid, that was the best news I could get in the morning while watching Bobby's World and eating strawberry poptarts.  Now as an adult, I have to make last minute plans to get my daughter to school and possibly be late to work if I have to end up taking her myself.  I can understand delays for snow and ice (I'm from SC), but today my daughter has a 2 hour delay...with dry roads, no snow, no sleet, and no ice anywhere. 

So why the delay?!  Are schools training our children to be a bunch of testicles that can't take the cold?  I'm just waiting for the day when she has a delay because the sun is too hot.

Maybe I feel like they're cutting her education short (over multiple "non-necessary" weather delays)...maybe I'm just bitter.  I don't have a delay for my job.  Meh. 









 Maybe she was looking at John Legend when Common was looking at her.  
  
Then again, he may have wondered what she was doing holding an invisible tray of food above her head and decided to skip that bullshit. 




 It may not happen to you, [but then again...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--hMJPUBwMc) 




 With direct contact from the pointy end, maybe. Black Widow picked up the scepter to close the portal and it didn't take control of her. 




 Pretty soon she'll be getting to the age where she has trouble with her vowel movements. 




 Not bad. It could work. 




 How would you spread your persuasion throughout the world in only 24 hours, though? Webcam show, one by one, or try to jump in on a live broadcast? 




 And you wouldn't even need a million dollars. 




 I'll tell you the same thing I once told an *ex*-girlfriend:

I like it, but I think you could go...bigger. 




 Talk to the President and get him to push whatever you want through the system?

Oh wait, I think I know what you're talking about... 









 I stopped reading your comment after the word "place" and for a second there...I thought you were talking about me.

Confundus, indeed. 




 I feel like this should be carved into a jail cell wall, right beside a Rita Hayworth poster... 




 Icing problem?! 




 Masturbating on Valentine's Day? Pathetic or not? 




 No lie, I have a version of that song in my car's mp3 player:

[I Can't Make You Love Me cover by Bon Iver](http://youtu.be/Q3VjaCy5gck)

You are definitely not the only one. Music has the capability of expressing what I'm feeling way more eloquently than what I could come up with. 




 At first, I got excited because my wife's name is also Janna...but then I realized she would never do anything like that for me. :(

Her Valentine's Day card would read more like...

"Just because it's Valentine's Day, that doesn't mean I'm going to touch you. Empty the trash." 




 :30 into the video is when the song starts. 









 At least Brian Regan can now get a cup of [black coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87QYajKxPn4). 




 The place I picked...took a direct hit.  I thought the shack was too obvious of a place to take cover.
  
All they would find would be a piece of my clothes, a small piece of my nose, and bone from my arm. 




 IMO, it depends on the degree of the accident.
  
Leaving vehicles involved in a traffic accident in the middle of the road (that could easily be moved to the side of the road) can cause traffic congestion and possibly another wreck down the line.  
  
If it's at all possible (car is capable of being moved, no one involved in the wreck is seriously injured, etc.)...it's a wise move to clear the road.

 Leslie Nielson was a serious actor before his role in Airplane!.  After that, he switched to comedy.  I could totally see Liam Neeson doing the same thing. 




 Me too. If they have their brights on, I won't flick mine to tell them...I just close my eyes and hope for the best.
