 oh cool! 




 it still fits, the squash banana is simba 




 The only thing I would want extra from this game is the ability to make my own character. Making a woman would be cool, for instance, but hey it looks rad anyway so yeh good luck to em. Can't wait to buy it :) 



















 Nice video! Will it be a 60 dollar purchase or subscription? 




 I've never looked into this game much, but can someone tell me if this is correct?

It will be a game where you buy and upgrade your space ship, you can leave your pilots seat at any time and board other ships or walk around space stations. You can use a gun and you can also land on planets (cutscene landing?)

If thats right that sounds really good, but will there be a story or is it more of an MMO experience type deal? 









 I've been to the U.S. and it really is full of lovely people. I think the american political system is horseshit and your social structure is unfair, but god damn, everyone I met over there was so friendly and kind. 









 I love PBS game show :) 









 Bethesda Harry Potter game would be amazing. Going to classes, learning spells, finding hogwarts secrets, having friends (companions) and all of that would be amazing. 




 I really hope they do voice acting in French with english subtitles, love French language :D 




 Looks really awesome, makes me want to go back to working on a proof of concept I did ages ago about a wild animal game:

 Corgi's are amazing! 









 Fear. 




 Writing is still important but its now become a first step for other mediums. Video content comes to mind (youtube videos like "explainers". Good speaking and imagery is important but the writing underneath is why people keep coming back. Edit: sorry, on mobile 




 sounds perfect, do you have a greenlight page? will probably get it

P.s. how did you get into games writing? I'm making my own games currently so I can get some experience writing stories for games. Did you do the same?
 




 Definitely would love to see a Bioshock game that tackles military interventionism, particularly given recent controversies surrounding drone strikes. It can really paint you into a corner when you start creating enemies as a consequence of trying to stop your enemies. If that can be intelligently critiqued I would be pretty stoked.

Along similar lines, I feel systems like the military industrial complex or the surveilance state would also be interesting issues. Metal Gear Solid has already addressed this pretty well already, though albeit in a completely different fashion to what Bioshock could do.
