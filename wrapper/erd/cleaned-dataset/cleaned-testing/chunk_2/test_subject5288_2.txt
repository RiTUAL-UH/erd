 Same with me, I have never even taken a selfie, let alone posting it :( 




 Think you forgot Ingress? 




 You guys don't understand, Lord DuARTe uses a Macbook to keep an eye on the enemy. 




 India... 




 Blazing hot. 40C/104F. 




 Thanks for the advice, I would definitely try that today! 




 But how do I go about drawing them... When I draw real-life people, they turn out to be a complete disaster :( 




 But my drawings will look very amateurish to you!...


[Here's one!](http://i.imgur.com/ZBMROO6.jpg) 




 Great! I never can do as good as that! 




 Yes!!! 




 Even I am glad that I took it up. Really helps me utilise my free time. Can you show me one of your drawings? :D 




 I did realize the fact, that's why I inserted it there :P


I quit drawing a few years back, but this year I started to love it again, and I started spending more of my time on it... 




 I live in Maharashtra... 




 I love drawing catoons! (and sneks, lol jk). What do you like to draw? :) 




 **MY EYES ARE RELIEVED!!** 




 I am in India, and I just finished the 10th grade exams... 




 I love drawing, and tinkering with my mobile... 




 What about you? 




 Ummm... You would find me a wierd personality, as I never listen to music and I don't play games... 




 I am just watching a few vids... 




 XD. So, what are you doing? 




 [Saw ths pic, can't stop laughing!](http://i.imgur.com/tW4AjAU.jpg) 




 Indian food :) ... What about you? 




 Sure :D 




 But the effects were great... 




 Bored, too... nothing much to do :( 




 Yeah, certainly nice to look at!  




 The James Cameron one! 




 Yes, I seem to prefer dogs! 




 You saw Avatar? 









 Then.... Gravity? 




 You saw Interstellar?

 It's about cats? Somehow, I don't seem to like cats... 




 Yes! 




 I've never read horror books, too. 




 Which ones do you like? 




 I have no work to do currently :( Just browsing reddit... 




 I never watch horror movies. Do you read books? 




 No. *Hint: The country which your team defeated in the Cricket World Cup semifinals* 




 Thanks! What do you plan to do now? 




 If you like animated movies, you would love to watch Home! It's a cute movie :D 




 Yep. 




 Nothing, just browsing CC, nothing to do :( What about you? 




 Hi, just feeling very bored! 




 Far off... 




 Nah... 




 I doubt... 




 Now guess where I live... 




 :P 




 I made it orange. 




 Australia? 




 Asia? 




 In your house? 




 [Here are my new shoes!](http://imgur.com/39L28Yw)   




 Water :P 




 I would, for sure. 3 of my friends have come over, will you be there in 2 hours? Will catch up with you! 




 I bought a Sketchers running shoes for my birthday! 




 I woke up and read the newspaper. That's about it :P In the evening, I would go for running, as I am excited about my new shoes :) 




 Hi! So, how's your day going? 




 Hey, no problem mate. :D 




 Thanks a lot! 




 Power cut at my place, and I switched to my mobile. Really can't do much at 1.20 AM without lights :'( 




 Visita


Reminds me of their epic failure. 




 Power cut here :( On my mobile now, really can't do much without lights at 1.15 AM :'( 




 Really sorry, my scanner is not working :'( Please forgive.

 Never heard of them... Can you tell about them? 




 On it!
 




 I am starting to love drawing now! 




 Thanks! 




 What was the epicentre? Any idea? 




 Shit! All safe? 




 I didn't get you! 




 Right! 




 Not Sunday yet, though! But Saturday's almost over :) 




 Saturday's almost over here :( 









 Same for you, mate.  




 Even I am hoping for the same...

 




 He was 14 when a bullet hit him during school rifle practice. He's still in coma now after 2 years... 




 I read that one of your friends suicided. Even one if my school friend was hit by a bullet, and I know how it feels :( 




 I haven't slept before 3 since the start of April! 




 Hey! What's up? 




 Hey, what's going on? 




 Happy birthday! 




 The British spellings are always used in my country, so I prefer them. 




 Mornings! That's what I've done always! 




 :D 




 Yes! Sure! I would love to :D 




 :( Thanks for the info, though! 




 I have seen you before on this sub posting about it... 




 My Nexus is currently at home, so I cannot provide proof. Till then, I am using a Moto G GPe. What about you, OnePlus shill?

 Apptly?

Ceiling. 




 Umm... I don't know... Never seen any cases or so... 




 Hmmm... Interesting. I read that it stops on a fact-book, but I guess it would be wrong. 




 The reason behind saying bless you is, when we sneeze, our heart-beat stops for a millisecond. 




 Hi, Philippines! 




 I know, the whole country is in ruins :( The tremors were felt here in India, too. 




 Seeing your username, are you fine? 




 Nope. I have never had one before :) 




 I don't think so :P
