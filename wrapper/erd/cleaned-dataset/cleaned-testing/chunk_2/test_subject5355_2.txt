 Round 1) An outright no rules street fight. Rocky gets boxing gloves if he wishes and fights in his shorts, the enemy gets whatever weapon they are most synonymous with (Han Solo gets a blaster, Vader gets a lightsaber, etc). Use of The Force is permitted, no vehicles or ships etc.

Round 2) A boxing match. No weapons, boxing gloves are optional.

Round 3) Same as round 1, but with Star Trek characters

Round 4) Same as round 2, but with Star Trek characters

Any Star Wars/Trek character from any canon is permitted. It is peak Rocky and he gets a montage before each fight.

Could he beat Chewbacca? 




 I need to pass a fitness test that requires: 25 pushups, 45 situps and an 8 on the shuttle test score.

I can easily beat the 25 pushups and shuttle run score, but I've never done a situp in my life. I can't even manage one. The form they want you to use is placing your hands on your lower thigh and move them along your leg up to your knee. I can get about 2/3 of the way up there and just can't get any higher. I can't even do one rep. I DO NOT get anyone to hold my feet down, I have to do it unassisted.

I need to be able to pass by the end of the year. What's a good place to start? 




 And if I fail, do I have to pay the full $990 course fee again, or can I just pay to sit the exam? 



















 Where there more people at Wayne Enterprises that new of Batman's identity? What about the military people contracting these designs? Or the people working on parts not made by Wayne Enterprises (perhaps the Batmobile's engine was made by Rolls Royce specifically for that vehicle? They found the wreckage in the tunnel in The Dark Knight and very few large projects like that are all designed by the one company, let alone by a small enough group to keep it all hush hush.

Is Batman being associated with Wayne Enterprises perhaps quite well known and just kept on the down low due to one big non-disclosure agreement? 
























  Last trophy I need for platinum. 




 The difference between just making contact with my body with the ruler and pressing hard in against my 'fat pad' yields and extra half inch. How am I supposed to be doing this? 
























 [This applies to Wiggles canon (TV shows, in character performances, books, etc) and not the irl Wiggles band who fill these roles.]

He stays awake, writing the songs, choreographing the dance moves and  managing the band. It's pretty clear that Murray has no interests outside of screwing around on his guitar, while Anthony is a pure food obsessed hedonist. Greg doesn't seem to have any active interest or hobbies outside of performing at all. So who is the hard worker churning out all those hits? Of course, it's Jeff.

Despite supposedly sleeping all day, he still manages to know all the words, music and moves. Why? Because he wrote it. He wrote all of it. And the rest just piggyback off his success. Not that he cares, everyone seems happy with this arrangement. I mean, how often do you get to sleep on your job without anyone getting angry with you? 









 Woah 














 I have one listed on the Steam market, but no one has bought it (it's been there for a few months). I even keep lowering the price. 







































 It's pretty common to see a King or second to the throne inspiring his troops from the front lines, before leading the soldiers into battle from the head of the pack. Was this common? If not, did it ever happen? How frequently would Kings actually join the fray? 









 Basically, I've been travelling a lot lately and this is the first day I've had to get on the Internet in two weeks, so I haven't kept up to speed with this game. I am about to go without Internet for awhile again in a few hours and I'm thinking of picking up a single player game to kill some time.

So, tl;dr, how crucial is the co-op to fully 'experiencing' this game? Is it like Borderlands, where I can still enjoy it single player, or is it more like Left 4 Dead where the emphasis is on multiplayer? 



















 You can use http://www.redditinvestigator.com/ to find out. I'm not sure how accurate it is, but I'm pretty sure it's right in my case. 




 A lot of good suggestions are making it to the front page today, so I thought I'd take a moment to suggest something I think Dota has needed for a long time: heroes should fart when they die. 

Honestly, I fully expected to have this feature by the time the game got out of beta, but that felt like a lifetime ago now. I think this should be added before TI5 as a priority feature, but they'll need to start ASAP if they're going to get all the VA's in to record farts for their characters in time. 


































 Firstly, these videos probably covered a wide time range as I've seen many posted, and it's been awhile since I've watched them so my specifics might be wrong.

At any rate, it was interesting to watch them because they often involved a lot of disarming and grappling. Was the common soldier trained in these techniques and if so, did they translate well into actual battles? Or was it more for 1v1 sparring and showfights? Kind of like how you learn a lot of advanced martial arts techniques, but when an actual fight breaks out you'll probably just use a basic grapple and pummel your opponent anyway? 









 Just want to know if I should buy now or hold out for a GOTY edition down the track. 




 Also if it's the latter, and my Plus subscription ends, do I get them back if I renew? What about save game progress and trophies? 
























 Is there a strict definition for what guides Vulcan logic? 




 Or to suggest that overly sexist and objectifying portrayals increases the average males perception or treatment of women?

Because at the moment it just makes me think of many other arguments from the past: violent videogames will increase crime (they didn't, and crime is at a low while violent games are at their most gory), heavy metal music will lead to Satanism (completely debunked), rise of availability of porn will lead to increased rape (no correlation has been shown, let alone a link).

What exactly are SJWs using as a basis for their beliefs that sexy videogame girls = increased sexism in society or violence towards women in videogames will lead to actual violence committed towards women.

It seems to me like average living conditions in a country, religiousness and experience with women on a day to day basis all seem like they'd be better predictors of sexism and ill treatment of women than fucking videogames. (everyone plays videogames these days too, more people than ever, so it's certainly not an exposure issue. Previous generations who don't play games seem more sexist?). However, even this is just speculation, so to avoid sounding hypocritical: I have no idea what factors influence sexism. But I certainly don't see any reason to believe videogames are any more responsible than any other factor at the moment.

Feel free to prove me wrong. 




 Excluding trade spam rooms of course. 














 Rules: Each round takes place in a standard wrestling cage. There is no escape and nowhere to hide, nor are there any weapons. Each fighter is in a pair of boxers, no equipment, no armour, just pure brutal fisticuffs. Force to die or concede wins. Geralt gets potions beforehand.

Round 1: Geralt vs Spock
Round 2: Geralt vs Batman
Round 3: Spock vs Batman 




 And what about this very question? Is this 'listable'? 




 I've never hit level cap in an MMORPG before, but I think this might be the first one I manage to do it in. My question is: What is there to do at that point? What exactly does an MMORPGs endgame involve? Constantly fighting the same bosses over and over again for the chance of slightly better equipment is how I picture MMORPG endgame to work, is this at all accurate? 



















 I just thought it would be funny to watch it from that perspective. A movie about Jim Carrey freaking out over nothing for an hour and a half, then walking out of a door in the ocean.

And all the in universe advertisements (like Marlon drinking his beer slowly in front of the camera) and things like the looping pedestrians/cyclists around his neighbourhood would look ridiculous.
Please tell me an edit like this exists.

**TL;DR: Is there an edit of the Truman Show that removes all references to Truman being in a television show, because that'd be boss** 




 Batman got absolutely stomped in the first fight, but in the second fight he seems to win pretty handedly. It's even at first, but towards the end Batman is shitstomping Bane. Why was the matchup suddenly so even between them at first, and could Batman have continued to keep up and even win without damaging his mask?

Scene for reference [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxqC9LyNo-0)

Also not sure if this entirely counts as on topic for this sub, or if it belongs in another sub. 









 The more obscure the better as I've probably played most games you're about to suggest. Preferably PC, but suggestions from any console is fine. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y13cES7MMd8#t=50 














 I'm really curious to know what Valve's intentions for it are. 














 And how it will work. Hopefully cosmetic stuff works like L4D2 and doesn't require you to play on a special server. This pretty much killed workshop for KF1 for me. 




 By 'proper' I guess I mean something with some actual depth and story or gameplay mechanics akin to a typical PC or console game. Something that doesn't rely on Internet access, purchases to continue playing, etc.

I know both XCOM and some Final Fantasy games are available, but I've played them all to death in the past. 




 And would I likely get banned? I've always entertained the idea of making a novelty account to collect celebrities opinions on my dick, but would they even see it? Would I likely just get downvoted and banned? Would it count as sexual harrasment/illegal (I wouldn't trick them, I'd be straight up like "Here's my dick, what do you think of it Mr. Musk?")

Even if I only got one in every 20 celebs to reply it'd be worth it. 




 Preferably an action RPG, but anything will do. Something that gives you good control over your stats and ability progression and have the choices actually matter.

Thanks!

Edit: Preferably a little less mainstream. Great suggestions so far, but I have played most of them already! 




 So basically, I'm having trouble getting my speakers to split the sound correctly. I have them all plugged in and they all produce sound, but only for the Left and Right sounds when I run tests. 

[So in reference to this image](http://i.imgur.com/T1yswxO.png), when I run the test, it first tests the left speakers. The speaker that should produce a sound here does. However, so does the center speaker, and the rear left and right speakers. During the test of the right speaker, again, rear left, rear right and the center speaker all produce sounds alongside the right speaker.

It then runs tests for the center speakers, rear speakers and sub - all of which produce no sound from any speaker.

Basically, left and right speaker are working as intended, but all remaining speakers seem to just play both the left and right sounds.

I've clearly set this up wrong somehow. Can anyone walk me through how to fix this? Thanks in advance!

 Firstly, I am Australian, and am assuming most first would countries have similar standards for leave and sick days.

Secondly, referring to CEOs of large multimillion dollar companies.

So yeah, what do their basic 'employee contract' look like in concern to days off? What happens if they call in sick but they're seen at the beach or something? 














 What's it like to have to date/be intimate with people you don't find physically attractive (due to your own limited options)? I can't imagine what it'd be like to have to 'settle'. Do you just overcome it and focus 100% on personality (to me, both looks and personality matter) or do you just partner up out of fear of being alone? HAVE you even managed to have relationships?

Do you feel self conscious all the time? Do you think it's impacted job opportunities? Friendships?

Is it a self imposed unnatractiveness (refusal to workout, etc) or did you just lose the genetic lottery?

TL;DR: How has being ugly affected your life? How do you deal with it? 




 Long story short, started with a Sorcerer build, used Soul Vessel to rebuild into Dex build for new game plus, have 12 Int and Attunement points pushing my soul level up that do nothing. Is there an item I can use to reduce them? I vaguely recall being able to do it in Demon's Souls. 




 Resident Evil 4 was the last RE game I really, really enjoyed. RE5 was good a single playthrough and messing around with a bit of co-op, it was a good game, but it was really where the series started to nosedive. I decided to give Resident Evil 6 and Revelations a shot, but they just bored me to tears. Is the series dead for good? 




 Title says it all. 




 Anything to keep an eye out for? Any must get boss soul weapons/armour? 




 All of the most frequent guests on QI get into an all out fight at the pub over some trivial fact in dispute. Who is the last one standing? This brawl also includes a wildcard, which will be explained below.

The 'contestants' are:

-Stephen Fry

-Alan Davies

-Bill Bailey

-Jo Brand

-Phill Jupitus

-Jimmy Carr

-Sean Lock

-Rich Hall

-David Mitchell

-Clive Anderson

-Rob Brydon

-Sandi Toksvig

-Wildcard (you may add on guest from the remaining guests who have appeared on QI from [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QI#Guest_appearances) if you wish).

**ROUNDS**

1) The all out brawl. Who wins? Who is dead last? What about a ranking from first to last?

2) Who was likely the most drunk?

3) Who most likely instigated the argument? 




 I noticed the store page lists ST:O has having Steam achievements. Where can I actually see these? 



















 They got less fun every year, and now we're reduced to a simple badge crafting. I know most people don't pay attention to them, but I think they're a nice touch of fun and fanfare, especially when they introduced unique cosmetics for games like Dota 2 into them last time. 




 This is currently being promoted in a giveaway thread on pcmasterrace: http://dimmdrive.com/

What does it actually do and why would I want to use it? 




 It's in a regular fist fight. No weapons or significant environmental features. Who is the strongest person current Alec Baldwin could beat? What about in his prime? 









 I bought a business and noticed I had only received income from it once over several days of play. At this rate, I don't feel like it will ever pay itself off. Definitely not before I finish story mode. 




 Basically, I remember getting this error about a week after I first got my PS4 and having to fiddle with the network settings for hours. I am getting it again now when trying to access the store any other PSN features. However, I was not getting it at the start of the current attacks, it only started yesterday.

So I'm wondering, is this just coincidental timing with the error returning, or are other users getting this error?

Edit: Australian, if that matters. 




 Again, not trolling, some people may interpret this as a jab at the game. I'm genuinely interested. Is there a breakdown of the costs anywhere? Does that 200 million include marketing costs or a fat paycheck for licensing? Maybe they absorbed engine development costs into it (assuming they built an engine instead of licencing it)?

Where did the money go precisely? 









 Anyone else having issues with this? Doesn't seem to appear in big picture or regular Steam. 




 An ultimate, with a suitably long cooldown (perhaps the longest in the game), that could reverse time by 3/3.5/4 seconds? Everything would be returned to the state the game was in several seconds ago (with the one exception being this ultimate is placed on cooldown).

Aghanim's Scepter allows you to rewind time while dead. 




 Particularly, actual expansions with new quests etc?

I was kind of disappointed to see Dark Souls 2 release three expansions AND a 'remastered' edition within the first year of its release, I regret not just waiting and getting the definitive version. What are the odds of The Witcher 3 taking the same path? Should I pre-order or wait a year or so for a 'complete' version to come out? 




 Are photos like this touched up?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_Nebula#mediaviewer/File:One_Picture,_Many_Stories.jpg

Or are there actually places like this I can visit and see the night that bright? Particularly, the bright red center nebula and the glowing blue and purple stars/galaxies scattered throughout.

What about space photos like this:

I get that nothing is faked, but MOST of that colour is outside of the visible light spectrum right? What would that look like to the human eye? Just black? 




 What are the big teams? The big strats/heroes? Any 'must watch' games from the past few months? 









 Also, does the customs counter in the records page only include the ones you have unlocked? 









 So I've got a pair of Sennheiser HD598s playing both through my PC and iPhone. I'm jumping back and forth between two tracks. One is a 320kpbs track ripped from a videogame. It's the original source file so you can bet it's high quality. The other is a 192kbps mp3 copy of it.

I'm failing to notice a difference between the two tracks, except that one is half the filesize. If I shuffle them and close my eyes, I can't tell which is which. Are my ears simply not good enough? My equipment? Why do people care so much about filetype and bitrate if not? Or do some songs simply compress better than others for whatever reason?

Educate me here audiophiles! 




 Unfortunately neither game seems to have Australian based servers, and I can't be bothered trying to PvP with lag. 




 I haven't played in awhile, but noticed today I am getting bullet bills in the middle of the pack and far more frequent 'good' items. I recently got a blue shell in second place. What is happening? 




 So I was posting on 4chan and (obviously) noticed that have a new captcha where I just have to press a checkbox to prove I am not a robot. How does this work?

I'm guessing users who pass enough captchas get this status, but if that's the case, why do I have to check a box at all? 




 I have a Gateway 3DS if that matters. I am just sick of grinding custom moves on the Wii U and wouldn't mind getting them all unlocked on my 3DS so I can transfer character sets over to the WiiU.

Thanks in advance! 









 What are the typical mistakes in this bracket? What roles should I learn to see the greatest progress? Is it better to play a farming game or an aggression game in this bracket (solo queue). Any guides specifically for this MMR range?

I know it's an awful vague question, but it's kind of hard to improve when I mostly play with people at my skill level (most of my friends are 2.5k MMR). 




 So who was right and about what in this video?

 What are the odds of items dropping? Do I have to just own the Arcana in my inventory or do I need to have it equipped? Does it have to be the PA Arcana? 









 While I'm at it: why was this solution so difficult to come up with? 









 Is it possible to get Druid's bear to stand next to his effigy, and get Druid in bear form? If not... can we have this please Valve? 














 I get an hour or two of cardio each week (15-25 minutes of jump rope most days of the week) and lift a bit of weights to keep some muscle definition.

My usual diet is stuff like chicken/beef stir fry (usually noodles over rice, since it reheats better), chicken or ham wraps/rolls, veggies (usually potato, carrot and broccoli), eggs, hamburgers (homemade) and occasionally red meat like sausages/chops. For breakfast: cereals like Wheat Biscuits, oats, cornflakes and Just Right with fruit once or twice a day (usually apple or banana). Occasionally soups and when I have toast (with eggs) it's wholemeal.

I usually just prepare all my lunches for the week (so one week might be wraps, next week stir fry, next week rolls/sandwiches) so it is a pretty static diet.

Now, the bad things. Once a week I'll usually have either takeout (KFC being my most common, usually a burger, a few pieces of chicken and a water instead of soft drink, followed by pizza, which I absolutely gorge on (I'm not overweight, but I freaking love pizza) and something like apple pie with cream once or so a week.

I can identify that this is a generally healthy lifestyle, but a close family member recently passed away from a heart attack which has me on full paranoia mode. Am I one day going to regret a couple of desserts and weekly takeout, or am I overexaggerating the effects of these bad foods?

Also, is there a better sub to ask this on? I thought of r/fitness, but I thought maybe they'd be more concerned with muscle gain than general health. 









 I finished the game in Grounded (first playthrough). I want to go back and finish it in Grounded + to get all the + trophies, but I also want the fully upgrade/shiv door trophies, which I don't think there is enough materials to get.

Is it possible to go Grounded  Easy + (get the upgrades and collectibles trophies)  Grounded + (for remaining + trophies) all with the one 'Joel'? Or can I only go down difficulties when starting a plus mode?

Phone rings

Hello, this is test_subject5355

Hi NS, this is Blank from Blank Inc., how are you today?

I'm good thanks

Now at this point, I usually just stop speaking. However, I noticed that sometimes there's an awkward pause. So I figured I'm doing it wrong and started sayings

I'm good thanks, and you?

Now all 3 times I did this, the person on the other end let out a light laugh. All 3 times. It might be because of how unconfidently I said it or am I not supposed to say that?

This question is probably pretty ridiculous, but I just feel like an anxious mess when using phones (talking over people, awkward silences, so forth) so maybe I'm overanalysing, but I don't know what I'm doing so I thought I may as well ask. 














 I just bought a PS4 and I have an old PS3 account that I forgot the password/DOB to. I contacted Sony support and sent passport for ID and they should be able to give me a new password. 

Anyway, I was wondering if I avoid online features and play games on the default account without creating a PSN account (User1 I think it is) and unlock trophies, can I sync those trophies with my PSN account once I get the password? Or will I have to start again?

Basically:
-Have old PS3 account
-Have PS4
-Unlocked trophies on PS4 profile that currently isn't associated with PSN
-What happens if I associate my old PS3 account with my PS4 profile on PSN? 









 I haven't really been watching lately, has 6.82 had any major impact on picks/strats? 




 Seems to be particularly common in chunks of chicken from stir fries. 









 Just curious, I went through my old family computer and I found a bunch of flash games (Stick RPG, Sinjid: Shadow of the Warrior) that I downloaded years ago. I started playing them again and all my save data is still there. It got me wondering where this data is stored. I'm playing them through Internet Explorer. Is it all stored in my IE cache (as if I was playing them online) or within the .swf? I thought it was kind of nifty going back through this stuff and want to back it up for memories sake, it feels strangely good in a nostalgic way to go through all this old stuff.
Thanks!

 I'm guessing it's because they're more reliable and will generally be better actors, but it always feels really weird. I often watch these movies assuming they're adult learners at small time colleges/unis before someone mentions that they're in high school or something.

It's particularly common in the horror genre. 














 I think this would be a great change. Valve's free to play model should extend to the store itself. Every game sold on Steam should become free to play, and Valve can support it by selling hats for your Steam profile pictures.

Hats could be purely cosmetic, or they can go the TF2 route and make hats 'sidegrades'.

Imagine:

**The Time Saver**

* +35% load time on the Steam store

* -15% quality of images


**The Merchant's Monocle**

* 5% better prices on the Steam market

* Maximum of 10 market purchases allowed a day


**Santa's Christmas Hat**

* +40% chance to receive drops while browsing the Steam store or playing Steam games during Christmas Day

* -75% relationship with your family


I for one think it would be an amazingly profitable venture for Steam, as well as benefiting all Steam users who can now play games as they please.

What other interesting hats would you like to see? 














 In my case, I just got offered a job working 7am to 7pm two days, then 12am to 7am two days with four days off. It basically just rotates like that non stop. While I think I'm capable of doing this and still maintaining a solid 6-8 hours of sleep a night, I was wondering if it would cause health issues?

I really want the job as it would work well with Uni since I'd get four days off back to back frequently to study/classes/assignments despite it being a full time paying job.

Will this be a health issue? What if I only did it for a year or two? 




 I'll keep things brief. I'm looking for a job relevant to my degree. I have taken a full time job in the mean time. They think I'm going to be here for years, I'm just treating it as a temporary job. I have applied for new jobs since then. Odds are, I'll get a smattering of interviews at random times throughout the coming months (not in one big block), so I can't just keep booking sick days or taking random time off throughout the day and my lunch breaks are only 30 minutes.

I have no leave accrued because I've only been working this job for a few days.

What do I do? I feel really trapped in this poor paying job with bad conditions and no career progressions, but I can't quit (financial reasons) and can't find a way to attend interviews for better jobs. 




 Do Americans know who the "Bananas in Pyjamas" are? 




 Is there any specific reason the games on Steam are being released in this order? Will we likely see all Final Fantasy games come to Steam (7, then 8, then 3, then 4, then 13)? It makes it seem like they don't ever intend to release 9, 10 or 5?

Also what are the odds of getting these games? Is there some reason we didn't get 9 after 8? The only reason I can think of for not getting 10 is because of the HD remake recently.

Particularly, will we likely see IX, X and XIII's sequels? 









 OK, so I have these very vague images in my head of a game I played when I was younger. I sincerely doubt anyone will be able to help me as I can't even hold the images in my head very well. But here we go anyway.

It was a PC game, I played it in the mid to late 90s. It was a first person game and I believe it involved you exploring a cave or something. I think early on you get attacked by a bat or some sort of flying creature. I can't remember if it was an FPS or not, but I think it might have been 'on rails' and had cinematic style graphics... I think.

I really can't remember anything else. May or may not have been set on another planet (it involved a lot of alien enemies).

Is there a thorough database somewhere I could peruse to maybe remember a bit better? 

Thanks.

Platform(s): PC

Genre: Unknown

Estimated year of release: 1990-2000

Graphics/art style: I think it was a combination of real life footage and animated? Or maybe entirely 2D. It had a 'realistic' look to it.

Notable characters: None

Notable gameplay mechanics: None

Other details: I don't remember anything :(

 Why did we 'invent' capital letters? When did they first appear and how else have they been used throughout history (now, usually for proper nouns and the starts of sentences along with some other niche uses)?

 I was just thinking, something that has helped me deal with my anxiety over the years is forcing myself into increasingly uncomfortable situations until I adjust to it. However, having the Internet has allowed me to avoid many things that could have served as a great means to overcome my anxiety much quicker (mostly to do with human interaction: leaving the house to shop, talk to salespeople, phone calls, etc).

Do you think a rise in Internet availability could be linked with a rise in anxiety? I know it's hard to judge this sort of thing since mental orders in general change their definitions over the years and reporting on the whole is on a rise (people more accepting about or it aware of it).

Is there any research done on this potential link?

 I just finished Chapter 3 and I haven't even finished the first day yet. I've done all the sidemissions that popped up (they felt scarce, tbh) and collected a fair amount of stuff. I remember feeling really pressed for time to do much in the original Dead Rising, but I'm just breezing through this one. I'll be finished well and truly before the six day mark.

Does Chapter progress slow down at all soon - or side mission frequency increase?

 Are you still using it? With SteamOS? What are the pros and cons?

The controller is obviously out of date, but how are you enjoying the trackpads?

Edit: I'm referring to the early Steamboxes that have been given out a few months back.
