 RAWR. Girl you need caps for those claws. 




 Well thanks for clearing that up. I mean. We're here for the same [reason](http://static.zerochan.net/Pokmon.full.399596.jpg). 




 I agree with this completely. What I think is that u/CaptButterToast kind of runs this whole Gen Wunner are obsessed with nothing in to the ground... in a few threads... because both sides are kind of so adamant about their position. But again, I just posted this video because I thought it was funny. And love Pokemon. 









 Yeah see I was in first grade, had both Red and Blue, and love all the generations. I can see both points of view... Funny I had a feeling about that. 




 Lol am I right though? Did you not play Gen 1 when it came out? 




 Ehrmahgawd you watched that video too 




 One could say the inverse, that younger fans don't appreciate Generation 1, because they didn't start playing until Generation 3. You make a bunch of valid points, it's just this video is satire. Not something to be Outrage(d) about. 




 Looks like $65 dollars to me. *cough* Sorry, had a bit of a dog groomer moment there. 









 Probably right, since most of the video relates to Generation 1. 




 I like how your pup has a healthy looking cranium. So many of them are so narrow it causes neurological problems. 




 My thoughts exactly. 




 I know, people would love this if they watched it enough to get to that part. 









 *there 




 I love Tonto National Forest! Heard a jaguar, saw a coatamundi and tons of peccary... Got a good burrito in Tempe... Scottsdale has good shopping... Just a bit heavy on gun totting conservatives. 




 See I moved from CA to WI, and not like Madison or Milwaukee either. Moved back 7 months later. 









 "FUCK! FUCKING FUCK!"

"Craig? Baby? Where are you?!"

"SHIT! KEVIN, WE'RE FUCKED! GET OVER HERE!"

"... Craig, calm down, I'm her- OH MY GOD. WHAT DID YOU DO CRAIG?! OH MY GOD WHAT DID YOU DO?! TELL ME!!! GODDAMNIT CRAIG, WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?!"

Craig sat there sobbing. Throwing his fist at the ground. Screaming. Torrents of tears fell to the ground already splattered in blood.

"Oh my god Craig, we have to get you out of here. There's going to be cops, investigators, detectives, I mean our finger prints are over... wait. She wrote something. This bitch wrote something."

Craig stopped his crying. He looked to the dark wall Kevin was pointing at. In blood, it read,

"AREA 51????????????" 




 There's only [one](http://global3.memecdn.com/pokemon-in-real-life_o_608017.jpg) legitimate answer.  




 "Seriously, you guys, I'm seriously." 




 I've been wanting to turn this in to a more complete story for awhile now. A world where disease kills off everyone except opioid addicts. People break off it to separate groups, tribes, and nations. Leading to an eventual Revolution of the ruling class. I'd call it 'The Opium Den'. 




 I sit waiting.

They weren't kidding,

Just staring is erecting.


This group drinks,

And grunts, and talks,

And I want her innards.


She's carrying,

And I can see it,

I just need patience.


I wait till they leave,

She walks off,

I follow her breath.


The bitch tilts and cocks,

I balk and dive down,

She keeps going.


I'm hot, I'm sweating,

It's a hundred degrees

And my lips are on-

"BILL!!! BILL!!! I GOT EM'! BAG'D THAT HUGE WOLF SONUVABITCH!"
 




 Mars is such a cruel place to live.

Don doesnt use my name, just keeps me locked up in this little cage all day and night while he fiddles with colonizers, mining for riches as I soil my cage.

My names Bethany; you should remember that, that and Ive been trafficked here for fucks and giggles.

Well, its been about 4 months since Don found me on a personal ad, drugged me, raped me, trapped me in a small box, and kept me in his work building on the Mars colony.

I only know where I am because of passerbys shooting the shit about the glories of space expansion.

No, I cant talk back, hes got a ball gag in my mouth, Don isnt that stupid.

I also know something thats quite interesting about the room Im trapped in, and that is that it contains quite a large amount of explosives.

I dont like to toot my own horn, but I know a thing or two about blowing buildings up to high heaven, in this case THE heavens.

During his last fuck-and-go, I managed to fiddle up a spare lighter from the sleaze bag's pocket and jam up my well, you get the point.

So Im going out with a bang. 




 We, the gutter junkies, the corrupt pharmacists, the strung out whores, the closet pill poppers holding nine-to-five jobs, were all that were left. Everyone else just never woke up. 




 Thank you. 









 I also have a shelf for my comic book and glass of milk

Ah, the 'Butter's Technique'. Comfort and class. 




 ... more the sexual scenes in the book. Clowns give me the heebie jeebies. 




 Well it's part of the job for small and medium dogs. Large dogs usually don't need it. Otherwise, millions of dogs would just scoot their butts on your carpets. And no one wants that. 




 I found out by reading Stephen King's 'It' at 13-14 














 This isn't a debate, just speak/type better english. 




 Even though this isn't new to me, and I don't think it belongs here, I love that it's here. Thank you so much. 




 I've been nothing but logical, I even presented evidence from GLAAD, gave you a bit of history on why people don't like the words, 'fag' or 'homosexual'. Unfortunately it goes upon deaf hears. This is like talking to a piece of cardboard --- that's me being condescending. 









 No but words bring up feelings, thoughts, memories. Words have emotive value. So stop using it and make the world a little bit better. K? Cool.  




 I can't stop laughing. 




 Oh oh oh, I know it's french, but [YELLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c-GeBqUgAA). I absolutely am in love with her. 




 I loved them live both times i saw them. She had George Bush's face on her bass drum pad for one show, and a Yes We Can for another. 




 Dog groomer :D 




 Sorry you feel that way, just trying to educate someone with poor word choice on a public platform. We are equals. Just that people in my community have a past of electroshock therapy, forced castrations and genital mutilations, being sent away to camps and therapist for 'help', being dragged behind cars, abused and battered; but it's fine, I just need not be offended and grow thicker skin. 




 I love them now... thanks for the share! I also added another band in my first post, Grand Ole Party. She sings AND plays drums, at the same time. So much badassary. 




 Woah man, just a gay dude letting you know what isn't acceptable in my community. Heed my word, not ignore what you don't understand. As they say, walk a mile in a man's shoes. Let this be an opportunity for you to learn something new and wonderful about our diverse world. 




 Anything by Metric.

Edit: I don't think she's ever made Top 40, she's recent though. Here's a video of [hers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meW7gONv0Wg)

Edit again: Also, holy shit, I can't believe I forgot [Grand Ole Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xziod5qt03k)- Look Out Young Son 




 I wouldn't say the worst, because I'm so used to it by now, but anal gland excretion.  




 Also, 'homosexuality'. Here's a GLAAD [page](http://www.glaad.org/reference/offensive) that talks about that word as well. Internet can be educational too. Not just a place to perpetuate shitty vocabulary in the honor of 'tradition'. 




 I was grooming two [American Straffordshire Terriers](http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/images11/AmericanStaffordshireTerrierMountbrierfarms935without.jpg), really easy, just a basic bath, with some light brushing and a nail grind. Well I was grinding one of the dogs nails, and I looked away for a second to answer a coworkers question, and she didn't like me just holding up her paw. She growled for half a second and snapped her jaws about an inch from my face. I heard her teeth. Finished the nails quickly. Took a break immediately. Sat smoking a cigarette with my hands shaking like I had Parkinson's. 




 Gave a guy with a dog a few dollars. Told my roommate about it. He told me that particular homeless guy beats said dog. Immediately felt terrible. 




 Mmmm... straight people claiming words about sexual minorities aren't insulting when they're told they are.... 




 Because porn. 




 I don't believe you. 




 Since I work with them, 94.3% of my day involves talking about them. Especially off work. Friends. Family. Random strangers walking down the street that notice i know exactly what breed of dog they own. 




 Elephants. Also, my first word. 




 A false positive HIV result. Fucked with my head for years. 




 Best: Graduating and running up to my friend and hugging while simultaneously swinging her around in circles.

Worst: Getting jumped by 30 bros cause my friend looked gay, and I was gay. Mostly because of him though. And I only got spit on. He got knocked out. 




 Ever hear of [Boomsday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomsday_(novel)? That. I want that. 




 1) Wut?

2) Hey,man, that's just like, your opinion.

3) Procreation and advanced societies don't necessarily correlate. "First World Countries" tend to have fewer babies, not more. More birth control, abortion, planned pregnancy. Essentially, people fucking in the butt.

4) First Nation Americans, Tahitians, Mesoamericans, Indians, I'm sure I'm missing a few others, but shoot, send me a message and i'll send you towards a whole bunch of historical websites on gay and transgendered relationships and social structures throughout history! Yay learning!

5) Try using the word gay. 'Homosexual' comes off as offensive. Makes me feel like I'm a monkey in a cage. But what do I know. I'm just a gay man in a straight man's world. 




 Weed, I gave myself to a higher power and listened to other people. Almost 11 months now? I forget. 




 [I'd be dancing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4jnaznUoQ) 




 Ex boyfriend fucking some dude with a girlfriend. *Justgayguyproblems* 




 Dog grooming, I play with puppies and make them look cute for money.

Edit: Why might I hate it? Occasional poop. 




 "It is a girguin,

A swephant, and last, a seer.

It'd be like The Fly, except all of those spliced animals would be chasing me.

 Their preferred food is [blood and flesh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxpecker#Diet_and_feeding). 









 No, just that we forced them to convert to Christianity and assimilation schools... 




 I don't know about all of it coming from Cracked... maybe Wiki... my submission came from a dog breeding website. 




 Also one of the last spots on earth to find a wild [cuban iguana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclura_nubila) 




 I would look in to Two-Spirited folks. We kind of fucked them up with our beliefs in sexuality and gender. Examples of same sex relationships and transgender folks exist aplenty in First Nation history. 




 Wasn't this on Cracked.com? 














 [OP's right, so hot right now](http://aiminglow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mugatu.jpg) 




 Do you stay classy? 




 Can our state splitting in to 6 different states positively affect the draught situation our state is going through right now? I hear that argument used, and it sounds logical, just wondering your thoughts on the proposition. 




 Why is it that you wish to run against a fellow democrat, incumbent or not?  




 Also to lighten the mood, here's my tortoise eating rose petals
...Because this whole thing kind of made me cry watching it. they're incredible and fascinating animals. there's no need for one to go through pain like this.

 Carpet bugs? 




 I also don't think you're a big breasted blonde girl that makes gifs. Again, so gay can't tell even if you were. ^Life 




 Dachshunds bite the most. Siberian huskies that are well behaved are far and in-between (I have one myself, [Ki](http://imgur.com/a/Lihhr) who I usually have to muzzle when I work with him). Cocker spaniels are usually great, but can have temper tantrums randomly. Chow-chows are known to do the same, just more frequently. I have to say, I love working with miniature schnauzers, just not when it comes to their feet. 




 I... don't know what that means. 




  Nah this just means the pup got groomed at PetCo, they give groomed dogs little bandanas. Source: groom dogs, and I've previously worked there.

Hopefully this helps?

 




 Hi, /u/StickleyMan, can you explain what Brazzers is? Or am I just too gay to function? *That last one is possible*. 




 I want a grooming van. No joke. I like my Jetta just fine.

Shelties are the shit! Make sure to find a good breeder, as recently, the breed standard has been for a narrow cranium, which has lead to a whole host of neurological disorders.

Other than that, need plenty of mental stimulation and exercise, basic to groom, just daily brushing, bath every few weeks.

 I grew up watching this guy, never thought twice about how funny it was till now. Huh. 




 [This](https://drawception.com/pub/panels/2012/5-16/RGybqrANnD-12.png) comes up on google when i search your username. I think it's just sad to begin with.

 I think Europe is good on life. Just saw Germany win the World Cup. 




 Hi Bill!
I grew up watching your shows in the classroom, and those shows helped blossom my interest in science throughout the years to such an extent! Thank you so much.
My question relates to extinct/endangered species and this current Holocene extinctionary period, and what we can do to prevent some of the loss.

I understand that certain institutions exist that preserve endangered and extinct animal DNA and bodily samples, such as [The Frozen Zoo at the San Diego Zoo](http://www.sandiegozooglobal.org/what_we_do_banking_genetic_resources/frozen_zoo/), with the hopes of maybe one day being able to recreate these species, such as what they did with the [Banteng](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Clone-of-endangered-species-succeeds-Angus-cow-2656880.php). You hear people talking about wanting to bring back the mammoth, or thylacine.

Some scientist, such as [Dr. Paul Martin](http://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Mammoths-Extinctions-Rewilding-Environments/dp/0520252438) actually wanted to sustain large numbers of ice age megafauna on the U.S. continent, brought in from other parts of the world.

My question is this: do you believe our resources are better spent conserving the life that currently exists on this planet, further preventing mass extinction? Are these ideas of resurrection too 'sic-fi' and farfetched to be beneficial in the name of biodiversity? 

Again, thank you so much for inspiring generations of kids around the country.
Cheers. 




 Shiny Golbat in Emerald. He was so adorable... I miss him.... So pink, so fresh.... 




 I've never heard 17 before. I live next to a condor sanctuary, and worked at one of the places that brought the population back. 




 [huge community of black jews in Israel, wouldn't be surprised if some of them are gay, cause, well, some people are gay. go figure.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Israel) 









 Did that yesterday. My client was like, "You were amazing! I've never seen anyone do it look that! It was like you were shoeing a horse." I told my coworker, her response was, "Whatever, we all fucking do it like that." 









 Gee thanks :D 




 That's the program I want to get in to! Along with 800 other people from around the world per year for 50 spots! 




 Sorry to hear that. If it's better than Ventura, I'm in Moorpark. More gibbons. 




 [it begins](http://weeatny.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/zombie-450x560.jpg) 




 Ah mah gawd the strawberries here in Ventura County are so good it's insane. And I grew up in Orange County, near Irvine, which has strawberry fields everywhere (at least it did.... sad... development....) 




 [omg, what do you mean, the show is so good and fresh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKS3MGriZcs) 




 What's the story behind this amazing piece of video? 














 I also noticed, I'm so jewish, I looked at that picture from right to left, and described it as such. 




 It is a girguin,

A swephant, and last, a seer.

I haiku'd that pic. 




 HOLY SHIT I LOVED THIS BAND THANK YOU SO MUCH.

edit: listened to them back in high school (2004), and this just made me so happy to hear them again. 









 A zebra, probably a Lybra, she was caught in my gaze

Like her distant cousin in pun, his starstruck.

Now a thirsty tiger like myself can't pass

A thick slice of that rump roast toasting in

My stomach by the moonlit sky on cocaine,

So of course I made one of those "Purrs you

Folk seem so interested, fascinated by; innocence.

That fat beast got on her fours and crawled

Towards the worst motherfucker in that place,

I proceded to lick my lips in anticipation, excitement.

Hours to the powers of infinite Algorithmic numerals

Passed by as I could taste that smooth red nectar,

That rotting smell in her nether region that enthralls,

Orchestrates the crowds to pull a Wagner Finale.

As my dead mother once snarled, "Patience, shithead.

And oh how she was so on the forehead! 

Seize the night!

I couldn't hold myself; claws extracted and my muscles

Pulsated in the direction of the flesh I was tearing off.

All I needed was a good grip, just the tip to tip the

Domino towards her larynx and esophageal passage.

Crush wouldn't even begin to describe the sounds that

Exuded out of her meat hole, snout flaring; fireworks.

I was bathing in showers of punctured pipelines giving

Oxygen not to her dying vivacarcass, but to my brain.

Puss, bile, feces, lymphatic fluids, bacteria I can't even say,

It all tasted like the best ecstasy I ever bought from a South Korean.

I mean honestly I'm surprised no one else said anything,

How embarrassing, there must of been sixty, seventy, other

Large Organisms in that same room, not to mention smaller

Non-invited creatons, protazoa, shit that can live for millennia.

I could of swore some of my saliva with that zebra's amniotic

Fluid got all over a Brown Hyena here for business, his markings

Only added to the stench of the carnaged carrion caf-carnival

(It's pretty much Lucifer meets your pretentious local French coffee place).

Some aardvark tried smelling up the flailing body, but I made it

Clear with my urine that my domience was in this territory.

And her breathing stopped.

Well someone had to break the ice, you know all those carnivores

Were in that kill from head to toe to tail to vestigial sense of empathy.

The plant eaters took the chance to sneak in some round two and three

Cud chewing, or in the various Rodentia, Lagamorph, anything else

Not so fucking flinty that I couldn't outrun a scary thought,

Whatever weed grows in the ever blood filled cracks in the grey

Cement layed on the backyard patio, I told him to do wood panels.

Everyone was in a feeding orgy, death brought life and some great

One on one on two on one on three beastial, primordial sexual

Encounters of the thirteenth kind, unlucky to the fallen soldier,

God Bless the flesh we are about to produce into skat, not rats.

But wait,

You are sitting on your pedestal thinking, "What a crazy tale, 

You corky, illmanered feline of an endangered speiciest deity.

You talk about death and violence like the weather, promotion,

Remotion from the motion you stir in our community, THE CHILDREN!

Sir, I'm pro-you-gonna-die, and that watermelon of a sense of morality

You're juggling on your head neglects one major factor.,

You can't run the jungle with out killing some fuckers.

Heads getting a roll, dinner plates go to my mate, you do you

And I'm gonna go ahead and do me while I finish this bitch Zebras

Blood covered tang smeared all across my nose;

CAN YOU SMELL THE FREEDOM? 









 I shared this with a friend. I told him it was sexuality in the modern age. He just said it was dark.
