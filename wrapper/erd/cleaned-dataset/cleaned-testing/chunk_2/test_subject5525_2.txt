 1. Good advice, as 1 out of every 50 eggs will be ...weird. Extra yolk, fertilized, or just generally gross. I break them singly into a plastic egg cup before I toss it in the pan/baking mix.

2. If you're having this big of a problem with egg shell, you're cracking your eggs too hard. Just tap them on the side with the back end of a knife, use both hands (pro level one handed!) to pull the shells apart...usually no fragments. 




 Excellent suggestions! Thanks so much. I definitely use outside storage, though that fried in my electrical explosion event too. This think looks lag free and powerful! Thanks again! 




 Over time,  I have learned to like the ending, but upon first read, it just pissed me off...it felt cheap, too easy...re-reading and reading again, and I feel a little bit better for it, but when I read those words, those oh so familiar words, after all this time....*sigh. 




 Most of my recording paths are "live" (for lack of a better description), basically an outboard sound source - outboard preamp - outboard effects - into the DAW. What plugins and VSTs that I do use are instrument modelers for my MIDI controller...and not big combo packs (like Komplete programs with over 250 instruments emulators, I look for downloads of single sounds, or just a few options for a single sound, depending on my needs... I know you need me to be more specific, but the reason that I'm attempting this build is that I had a major electrical fuckaroo caused by an act of drunk people driving into power pole...fried my studio, and most everything connected to it....including a very high end APC surge protector...with the insurance nightmare, it's been months (almost a year) since I've been able to use the studio, so it's difficult to remember all the VSTs and plugins that I have used in the past.) I will say again that VSTs and plugins are minor compared to the "live" aspect of my recording. (I know that Cubase is built for beatmasters and electronica, but it has features that work for me as a live recorder.)

As far as tracks, most songs would have five or six stereo tracks (the way I record/mix that means 10-12 single tracks) effects tracks for each of those, and maybe 3-5 digital/midi tracks, with effects tracks for each of those...so 35 tracks max, and that would be a very "busy" piece for me.

The only other pertinent thing I would add is I would like to have the ability to use a dual monitor system...my last studio did not, but I think that would make my life a little easier; having both the ability to split screens so that the DAW is on one screen, and effects/emulators/MIDI can run on the other, and to mirror, so when I'm working with other musicians we can both see the same DAW while working in different area of my studio corner. (And, I'm not much for overclocking or anything, my DAC provides external clocking anyway, pretty sure.)

Sorry so wordy, and I appreciate whatever advice is coming my way! 




 None. Digital Audio converter will run on USB 2.0. Mic/instrument/midi will run through DA converter. 




 Read on. You will be given an opportunity to stop early. Many of us wish we had. But you won't. And King will call you out for your decision... "You are the grim, goal-oriented ones who will not believe the joy is the journey rather than the destination...who still get the lovemaking confused with the paltry squirt that comes to end the lovemaking." You will read to the end, oh yes, and you will see...yes, you will see. You will finally see.

The next time you read it, stop there. It's better that way. 




 I would like to, but my previous PC did not...latency was noticeable in some heavy application sound paths.  




 I need to replace my digital audio workstation! Thinking about a combo machine that I could also use for general video editing (no software chosen, youtube quality stuff) and photoshop applications. DAW running Cubase 5, (maybe upgrading) along with several other virtual sound editors/effects/modulators/emulators. Lag is a killer in sound recording, of course, so let's avoid that. Budget on the low end, let's try to keep it under a grand? I can source OS and peripherals elsewhere.  




 Self-explanatory.
 




 I tried everything...the only thing that worked for me was patience, and trying to be understanding and not filled with self hate when I failed, which I did, over and over and over and over again. But each time I failed, I would let them grow a little bit farther. I still don't know if I've succeeded, I just haven't bit my nails in quite a while, I may still bite them in the future. But if I do, I'll move on, start over, and be patient. I will win. 




 Same problem here. I just quit biting my nails recently, (three year process, not biting for months now) and it seems to have gotten worse. Inside of my cheeks are beat to hell. 




 That was badass. I think the commentators will be washing their underwear and extra time or two...they really seemed to enjoy that. 




 Lick your lips, moan, look him deeply in the eyes, grunt and say..

"I'm gonna be pickin' your ball hair outta my teeth for *days*!"

Try to be sexy when you do, it helps.
 




 I do it all the time.

I'm up to one orgasm. Then I take a nap for 56 minutes.
 




 Didn't really get that either. I thought perhaps she's mad at the way Glen's been acting about the whole thing, but if she was mad about Glen being super mad, why get super mad at Glen?

Still don't understand women, even when fictionalized. *sigh. 




 Two methods here. As mentioned, the menu puts profit above all else...the items that are described the best, or boxed out, or "featured" or some such, are the items that the restaurant makes the most profit on. These are not necessarily the best items, just the ones that make the most money. Quick menu rule of thumb...if you want good food, order what the restaurant specializes in. Eating in a steakhouse, order steak. Pizza joint? Stay away from the sandwiches. Don't order chicken at a seafood joint. Other method is to chat up your server. They may suggest items with a high markup to try and pad their tip, but engage them, and ask them what do they eat when they get off work. Tip accordingly for awesome suggestions. 




 Lucifer's Hammer - Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (sp?)... the book that turned me on to reading oh so long ago. Great epic end of the world shit right here man. 




 This is a good idea. There is a disconnect in expectations as most men are waiting to meet their insatiable whore while most women are waiting to meet their Prince Charming...or, women need to watch more porn, and men need to watch more Disney.

Or Disney Porn. Just sayin'. 




 One time my future wife and I were hanging out with some friends at our local bar. I was yuckin' it up, being the life of the party (my thing) and the future wifey-poo says something-or-other while I was talking to some friends, so I face-palmed her, and (loudly) said...

 "SHUUUUSH! Grownups talking!

We are still together, married for three years, believe it or not, though she does tell me (too often) that that was the closest she's ever been to slapping the dogshit outta me. Even though I got a great laugh out of that line, in the end, not worth it, wouldn't recommend it...

 




 "Oh, you were *in* the Holocaust? Well at least you weren't raped in the Holocaust." 




 130 pounds of prime rib, about 45 filets of tenderloin, a couple of porterhouse steaks, about 50 top sirloin steaks, about 30 ribeyes, 250 baked potatoes, four pounds of creamed spinach, about two gallons of rice, 20 filets of salmon, 20 filets of swordfish, two pounds of shrimp, 40 racks of babyback ribs, and 40 chicken breasts. (I had to work, had leftover ribs with the wife when I got home around midnight. Happy Valentine's Day!) 




 I call mine the Rubik's Cube....because it gets harder the more you play with it. 




 So much of our reality is based on that fiction. 




 A smile.


Seriously. Whether it's sexy short skirts, or a long skirt and no undies, or sweat pants and tank top like Panda said, the most important thing is confidence and fun.

For me, just the smile, when we get home, please. I don't need anything else. 




 Lol....true, it has been said that you can turn to any random page of the bible and find relevance. The bible is full of death, so really no surprise that that is mentioned often, but it was neat to see how many chapter 2, verses 17 had something in common. (I researched chapters 21 verses 7 and didn't see as many commonalities.) Just a statistical blip, but it was fun researching it. (An atheist's best weapon is biblical knowledge, you know!) 




 Hmmm....

So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. Ecclesiastes 2:17

The LORD has done what he planned; he has fulfilled his word, which he decreed long ago. He has overthrown you without pity, he has let the enemy gloat over you, he has exalted the horn of your foes. Lamentations 2:17

Let the priests, who minister before the LORD, weep between the temple porch and the altar. Let them say, "Spare your people, O LORD. Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, 'Where is their God?' "  Joel 2:17

The arrogance of man will be brought low and the pride of men humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,  Isaiah 2:17

Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether. Song of Solomon 2:17

And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams  Acts 2:17

Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. James 2 2:17

And the world and its desires are fading away, but the person who does God's will remains forever. John 2:17

but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die. Genesis 2:17

Very interesting. I wonder if this was intended or mere happenstance. A lot of these verses sort of...*fit*.
 




 I saw it...curiouser and curiouser... 




 You spelled "Idiots" wrong. 




 Good read, opinion adjusted, but, reading the report, I feel like the main thing I learned is that here is another example of a complex economic system being described two very different ways. The ROI of 7:1 (I wasn't familiar with the 22:1, that seems high!) and 1:10 shows the difference between NASA *contributing* to new ideas, and the *direct* effect of creating businesses or patentable new items that result in private sector profit. (I admit to being biased in favor of NASA, I live right down the road from America's Spaceport, and there's nothing like watching a launch light up the night sky over the Atlantic!) 




 We needed NASA to get us off the planet. And they did so. But only with the entire nation behind the endeavour, fueled by the Cold War scare. Now that we have been there, national interest is far lower, and the return on investment is perceived to be low, though the opposite has been proven, even showing that compared to other monies spent on government program, NASA has the best ROI than any other program in history. But, short of some international boogeyman threatening to take the moon from us, the future is going to be about money. NASA is more about science, and I think that they will continue that mission in the future, but the next space race is already on, and it's a race for revenue. Whether it will be from mining asteroids, or lunar tourism, or orbiting solar power generation stations, or even asteriod based robotic manufacturing plants, private companies will lead the way in further exploration as they try to find the money hidden in space. Overall, I feel like this is a good thing, private companies taking the risks, and reaping the rewards will mean that many private citizens in the near future will have access to space. This will lead to colonization, whether orbital, lunar, or other, and once humans are living in space, there will be more opportunites for people in support positions for those working in space based industry. (Those folks gotta eat, somebody will get up there and figure out how to open a restaurant, though I think a bar would probably be first!) 




 I think the media is being careful...there's a strong chance that this guy could end up looking a bit like a hero. Read the "manifesto" and ignore the second half, and it's like a Hollywood movie where the good guy is identified as the bad guy by the bad guys that wear the uniforms of the good guys.

Also, the MSM doens't go out of it's way to report on cops looking bad at their jobs, and so far Dormer is making the LAPD look like a bunch of boy scouts. Watch, when they catch (and kill, most likely) this guy, this story will suddenly get a whole lot of coverage. 




 Sure, sure, sure, let's all sit down and have a rational conversation, but ask yourself, *is it funny?* (Note: I don't think the situation is funny, really it's just a bit disturbing, and probably would be best handled in some other fashion than mine, but if they choose to take my advice I feel I should add that they put a camera in the box as well, you know, *for the funny!* 




 If I had a penchant for stealing panties from my female friends and GFs of my male friends, and got a box full of panties, and *then* uncovered pictures of my male friends and BFs of my female friends wearing those panties, it would certainly make me think twice about repeating that behavior! Letters not necessary, I suppose, but a bonus, as OP stated that he wanted to preserve the friendship. 




 Tough question. Here's why. 

Sound: Everybody likes a different sound. And everybody plays a different style. Fingerstyle pickers want a real bright sound. Chorders want something that's going to ring out a bit. Compound that with the fact that the strings that I like on my acoustic are gonna sound different on yours.

Size: The gauge of the string is important as well. Real thin sets (from .007 or .008) are for real light players or softer sounds, heavier sets for the big strummers. Gauge of the sting will affect brightness to a small degree, with heavier strings, generally, being brighter.

Metal: Lots of different types of metal besides steel. Steel nickel wound. Brass/phosphorous. Hell, you can buy strings with a gold coat if you want. Different types of metals will give you different types of sounds and finger feel.

Price: Cheapo strings are usually just that, but expensive doesn't mean good.

Life: If you're touring, and changing sets every four days, then the life of your strings really doesn't matter. But if you're like the other 99.9% of us, you're probably on a budget, and want those strings to last a bit. Each company's strings are a little different here, and unfortunately the only way to compare is to buy them.
 
So, for me, I choose Martin Marquis 80/20 Phosphor/Bronze with the unwound Gstring, med gauge. (.009). Because, I like the way it feels on my fingers, I prefer a med-heavy gauge, because sometimes I like to get funky on my acoustic. I like the life of my Martin Marquis, I like C.F. Martin in general (my box isn't a Martin), and they formulate those strings for players like me; casual players that want ring and sustain, that want a long life from their strings, want to minimize breakage, and that play the style that I do, which is, mostly chords, some fingerstyle, some flatpicking, etc.

Try a few on for size and see what you like. Talk to your shop guy, he probably plays, and probably has an opinion, and it is probably as worthless as mine! 

 




 Didn't think about cutting a blank to use as a template! Genius! I had planned on using a press (homemade, of course!) with the bit I was fantasizing about existing, with the wood clamped down. But the template thing might work for me; the goal is to cut a significantly large amount of same-sized discs. 




 Saw these when I made the trip to my local HD...but when I asked the orangeman if they had arbors without the drill bit I just got a blank stare.... 




 It seems so simple, but I cannot find what I'm looking for. I need a hole saw. But every one that I have found has the pilot bit on the arbor. I'm looking for a hole saw bit without the pilot bit. (I don't need the hole, I need the circle of wood...without a hole in the middle!) What is this thing called, and where can I find it? Gotta be quicker and more exact than my jigsaw! 




 1. Collect letters from all women missing panties, politely explaining that he should stop, but that they understand that he has a fetish that makes him do this.

2. Collect panties from all women involved.

3. Get a box. 

4. In the box from top to bottom should be:

* A typewriten note stating that you are still friends, hope this helps, enjoy the panties.
* Letters from the women involved.

* Panties.

* In the bottom of the box, include a picture of all the men that have had GF missing panties, dressed in the panties that are in the box, and nothing else. Dissapproving looks a bonus here.

Mail the box off, and wait. Something should happen. 




 Hmmm...Depends. If the eggroll was Chinese style, you most likely are looking at a snake fang. This signifies good luck in the Chinese culture. The tradition is that whoever ends up with that snake fang stuck in their upper gum is considered the "winner" and you should return to the restaurant/store for your prize!

If the eggroll was Japanese style however, it's probably a bird's talon, and it means that you have been marked for assassination by the Yakuza. You should probably find a safe house, lay low for a while.

If the eggroll was any other Oriental style, than you probably have a cat claw there....nothing to worry about. In this down economy, many eggroll manufacturers and restaurants are cost cutting however they can!

But, a word of caution, if this was an American style eggroll, you have found what is locally called "a reason to sue the shit tits off of somebody" and should lawyer up and get ready for your payday, even though there was no real harm to you.

Hope this helped!

Expertise: I've eaten like 14,000 eggrolls in my life. But I ain't never seent nothin like that! 









 As much as I love Family Guy, I save all my props for the music that you guys do...really over the top, and we appreciate it! Any thoughts about a full length Family Guy musical?
 




 These people must not ever have heard of the internet. When you tell us "Hey, don't manipulate this picture in any way" we say "Challenge accepted." 




 I would totally go check out someone who calls themselves Slappy McNuts....I don't know why, but I would have to know. I don't know what kind of performance I would expect, however. 




 Have you considered Slappy McNuts? Just off the top of my head... 




 Worth the read. It reminds me of some of King's early work, especially some of the short stories. Also, read his other works (Heart shaped box and 20th Century Ghosts)...he shows his father's quirk of linking his stories together. (BTW...20th Century Ghosts is outstanding, if a little confusing.) 




 I barely fit in them too...sometimes it's like carrying around a hotdog in a hefty bag. So what do you do? Tie it off with a bread tie? Duct tape? Rubber bands?  




 Nope...that's easy...awww, hell!! Bastard!

 TiL about Albert Fish, some cool ass snake, and warp drive. I love my fucking homepage! 




 Read on. 




 That's the one. It reads a bit like a textbook, but I believe that investing the time to get to know your DAW is going to help you in the long run. Happy recording! 




 Love it. Will buy, even not knowing what mold! 




 1. Not a lot of info here, but first guess is that if it's not showing in your VST plugin list it's because you haven't added it to your VST plugin list yet (those are two different actions). 

2. Hopefully it came with a book. Read it. Read it again. Take notes. Reference it. I love my cubase, but if I had any real complaints about it, it would be that it doesn't have a real "natural user feel" to it...there is a big learning curve. I use 4 still, and I'm still learning. Also check out [Steinberg.net](http://www.steinberg.net/en/home.html) for specific info about cubase, and [tweakheadz.com](http://tweakheadz.com) for general recording tips.

3. I love my cubase. It was built for digital (dance, edm, electronica, etc) but I use it for (mostly) live recording, and like more than any other DAW that I've used. Use the trial, if you like it, pull the trigger on the full version.
 









 I do all right playing the blues, but I play by ears and heart. I've heard some guys rip SRV perfectly, but it somehow misses something...Stevie had some reason for those notes that the rest of us can only experience, never replicate. 




 Pork, red onions, pineapple (or mango), plus spiciness. Yum. 




 I have no practical advice to give you, so I'll share a George Carlin quote instead. 

"It's not enough to know *how* to play the blues, you must know *why* to play the blues." 




 Strums for each chord, or rhythmic strumming pattern would depend on song and player choice. Assuming our example song is in 4/4 (common) time, you would have a lot of options.
 Whole note strumming would be strumming the chord one time, and letting ring for the other three counts of each four beat measure (Strum-two-three-four).  Half-note strumming would be strum-two-strum-four. This is way over simplified, as most rhythmic strumming is going to be a mixture of up and down strums, at a mixture of tempo, depending on song and player.

If you're asking for practice reasons, the easiest answer, for a 4/4 song, is to strum each chord four times per measure (quarter-note strumming). Your example song would be: E,E,E,E,D,D,D,D,G,G,G,G,A,A,A,A, in the 1-2-3-4 manner. 




 Ummm...all of them? Most of them, really. Not into bigger girls too much, but I that doesn't mean that I haven't found an individual bigger girl sexy. I'm probably the wrong dude to answer this, because yes, I love me some sexy bodies, but I am so easily turned off by negative attitudes, poor intelligence, unwilling spirit, etc. Give me an average looking girl with a can-do attitude, and I found the sexiest girl alive! 




 Slow cooking really is as easy as everyone says. But here's some protips:

* I really recommend against cooking from frozen due to the food being in the temperature danger zone for more than four hours. Most of the time you're going to be safe, but it's that one time that will change your life. Food-bourne illnesses will make you want to be dead. Thaw your meats a day ahead of time.

* Red meats really benefit from browning before crocking. If you have time, cut steaks into 1 ro 2" cubes, brown in oil, salt and pepper, (don't cook them, just brown the outside) and toss in the crock. Extra flavor here we come!

* Crocking generally means that you're cooking with a liquid. Over that large amount of time, your liquids are going to concentrate somewhat. Be careful when adding spices. If you put two tablespoons of salt in two cups of water, you're gonna come back to two tablespoons of salt in 3/4 cup of water. I add little spice/flavor at the beginning, taste about one hour before you expect to eat, and adjust accordingly.

* Don't be afraid of bone-in meat. Crock it, pull the bones. Slow heat breaks down all kinds of connective tissue, that's why crocking is so awesome.

* Because of above, don't be afraid of discount cuts of meat. Chuck roasts, chicken thigh, random chops of pork are all great meats that will break down easily.

* I had a horrible experience trying something with fish. I don't recommend it. But that's just me.

* Check recipes for ideas. You don't need recipes, but there are a lot of really cool ideas to crock up. Recipe is meat+liquid+seasoning+time. Simple.

* Have fun, and remember to turn your crock off when you're done with it. Worst baked on disaster ever! 




 No matter how much you shake and dance, the last drop always ends up in your pants. 




 Your school has nice balls. 




 Would also add a big hurdle for me to jump over, and hard lesson learned..

You are never "done" writing a song.

I've changed my songs over and over and over again. Each time I play it, it seems like I see an opportunity to improve the message the lyrics were trying to convey, or a slightly more fitting guitar phrase that fits the mood of the song. 

I have songs that I've been working on since a teenager, and while my friends from high school would probably recognize the song that I play for them, they would also recognize that it's nothing like the one they heard the first time, oh so long ago. 




 I've tried to share Zach Deputy on reddit so many different times...and nobody seems to appreciate him. Part of the problem is most of the YT vids are just not showing what it's like to see him live. Huge fan from FL, loving seeing someone else rep ZD!

 I'm gonna go with... all of them. Hated the 90's. At least pop stuff. 




 Whatever you do, do not dumb yourself down. You might attract guys, but they might be the wrong kind. The reason that you are getting approached by older men are because older men (me!) also exude confidence, and generally have our shit together. 

Way I see it, two options: One, start talking to people, making plans, and starting things on your own. Not necessaryily asking guys out on dates, but start organising things on your own. If guys can talk to you a bit and get to know you, and find that you aren't that intimidating, your prospects might go up. Inversely, just start chatting the guys up, and go on and exude your confindence. Ask them..."So, when are you going to ask me out on a date?" Stay friendly, and I hope you find what you're looking for. (I did!) 




 True, and I stated that in my comment. My point was how many people are taking that little blue pill, not because they have limpus dickus, but because "the tv told me to ask my doctor"? 




 Wasn't selling "Uncle Leroy's Calmative" out of the back of a horse drawn trailer a business model? I can see the comparison. 




 True enough. I didn't think of energy drinks as "medicine"...I was looking more at big pharma taking the place of snake oil salesmen.
 




 Quacks and snake oil aren't really the issue anymore. Science has paved the way for a new style of schyster. 

It seems like now the goal is to develop the drug alongside the symptoms...diseases that we've never heard of now get nationwide commercial coverage as we discuss Restless Leg Syndrome, or how often a dude over 50 is supposed to be pissing.

I'm not belittling people that have real issues that need real medicine to help them, but how much were we as a nation discussing Erectile Dysfunction before the advent of Viagara? It seems from the content of commericial advertising that just about every healthy male over the age of 50 or so is in dire need of propping up their boners so their hot middle aged wife doesn't leave them for the tennis instructor. Same thing with ADD, ADHD, MAOI's, and the pharmacopia of antidepressants that are now available.

In short, why have fake meds when we can count on fake (ok, not fake, but trumped up, overstated, or broadly and casually diagnosed )diseases to make "real" meds for? 




 I would also suggest offering a small reward if you wanted the physical card returned to you (enough to cover postage and a bit to sweeten the deal) or specifying that you just want the data and providing an email address or website for the pics/data to be uploaded to.  




 To be considered an "Advanced" guitar player, the player must:

* Show up fifteen minutes late to practice. At least.

* Have visible tattoos/piercings. (Face tattoos will be accepted as a substitute for piercings, but multiple piercings will not be accepted in lieu of tattoos.)

* Refusal to carry any gear but his/her own to and from gigs.

* Must have one of the following: (Consistent alcoholism, recurring mental issues, or recovering addiction to hard drugs. (Marijuana does **not** count.))

* Must also have one of these advanced habits: (Playing parts of songs that the band does not know/perform while lead singer engages the crowd, the ability to sing backups in a mike that is not hot, or the ability to cue primadonna meltdowns on cue.)

 Love to throw with you, or buy you a beer. I'm bringing the team from New Smyrna down, six of us, to check out what Wickam Park has to offer. 




 Nice to see this. I've been talking about the "Big Mac Effect" for a long time, both on line and in person, declaring that as long as Joe Schmo can hit up the local McDonalds and get a Big Mac for a couple bucks, he's gonna think that everything's all right with the world. It's good to see some hard science that shows this. 




 Hmmm....bite two corners off my BBQ hot pocket and blow through the thing? Are you trying to get me to cool my hot pocket, or defaceify my wife? This seems like it could be a terrible idea....that I'm gonna try anyway! Look out puppies/wife/small children, daddy's blowing a lava pocket! 




 Upvote for visibility....better follow through. And be careful. They don't like being filmed when working, they certainly aren't going to like this.

 [Disco Duck](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxf2KCSyvgQ) (Yes seriously.) It was done by a radio dj and his band, Rick Dees and his Cast of Idiots. It was on an album of "funny" songs, lots of stuff that would have been featured on Dr. Demento's show. I was about five or six at the time. 




 Yep, got a lot to work with there. I should be ok. I'll just have another diet Dr. Pepper...*pop *fizz * slurp....shit, now I'm energetically depressed! Hand me my guitar and that pipe over there! *spark *puff *aaaahhhh...much better. 




 But the people on tv look so happy when they drink diet Dr. Pepper...has the doctor been lying to me? But, I drink diet sodas for my caffeine addiction, so I'm more likely to develop depression by drinking a beverage that reduces my chance of developing depression? Fuck, I'm confused. Probably all the diet sodas. 




 I've got a quick wit and an even quicker mouth, and it's gotten me into trouble plenty in the past...with gf/parents/job/school.

Got better and better jobs which required me to not act like a drunk monkey on a daily basis, and struggled with both cursing, and content, of what I was saying.

I developed what I call the "2 beat rule". Whenever I start to say something, I take just two beats (ill-defined segment of time, but long enough to review my intended statement) and think about what the other person will hear if I say what I'm about to say. 

More often than not, I choose to say nothing, because what I hear in my head suddenly sounds hurtful or base. 

But I let it rip later when I'm at the bar!

Good luck. Being aware of your language and the way you use it is really the first step. Whatever steps you take next will more than likely work because you have already identified a habit that you want to change.

 Nope. I liked the remake for the multiplayer, the level play was quite weak though. 




 yep, exactly...cool sound to add to your repertoire on acoustic. 




 Goldeneye. Nintendo 64 or WII. 




 Ahh...the good old Teapot Dome scandal! Good God I love history! 




 1. Probably the post WWII to Vietnam era.

2. Civil War.

3. Lots. I had a really awesome teacher in HS, and we talked about a lot of things that were left out of our sanitized textbooks. I wish I had spent more time with him, but he inspired me to look for my own truths, and I have for the last thirty years. Thank you, Mr. Postlethaite, OHS!

4. You could...maybe group SMS for historical events? Today in history, or that sort of thing...

5. I am an employer, but I don't think I care about your knowledge of US history, outside of if you had a college degree, because any degree is a good thing.


Thanks for being a teacher, keep up the good work! 




 Sounds like reasonable parenting, so that's probably not an issue. And good relationships at home (I'm still a fan of stay at home parents, doesn't matter which one!). ANd I read RefuseBit's comment, and wonder if maybe that might be part of it...eight is a strange age, he might be gifted, but without the ability/vocabulary to express his interests, combined with his sort of timidness might lead to the kind of behavior that he's evincing. 

Overall, I think he bears watching, but I wouldn't overworry. You sound like a cool aunt/uncle; stay involved, and help him evolve, and take him back to the lab! My kids would be so jealous! 




 It was awesome of her, and I'm lucky, because she has been and still is adventurous, and we've had much fun because of that...but I still know that I haven't made up for that night...lol. I hope it works out awesome for all three of you guys!
 




 I would be thrilled beyond belief. I've talked to my SO about this before, and it doesn't seem to be her thing, but a guy can hope! I would say be careful, because you just don't know where his head might be at any given day...you would want to tease him, give him clues about what was about to happen instead of an outright surprise.

Let me share a story with you. 

Long ago, before my wife was my wife, I was working at a restaurant near the house. A bit too far to ride the bike, she would give me a ride and pick me up at night when I got off, around midnight most nights.

She comes to pick me up, and I open the door to slide into the car, and there she is, my beautiful eventual wife, in all her naked glory, sitting in the driver's seat.

Unlike every other guy in the world, instead of being thrilled about this turn of events, I half-smirk, say something stupid, and get in the car to go home. (I don't remember what I said, my wife's a redditor, perhaps she'll stop by and tell you what dumb thing I said instead of telling her how beautiful she is, or how impressed I was with her being so brave to surprise me by picking me up completely naked.)

What she didn't know is that I had just gone through one of the worst days of work I had ever had. To her credit, I no longer remember what was so terrible that night, I just have a very clear memory of her amazing naked body shining in the dome light of her VW Rabbit! 

Just sayin' be careful of an outright surprise...you might not get the disired result. You probably will, but there's that outside chance that his head might not be in the right place...and it would be terrible if another man on this planet was stupid enough to ruin something awesome by not being able to shift gears fast enough!

    (sorry babe!) 




 Keep the pick hand moving during the ring-out portion of the chord, just lift the pick off the strings.

Practice this by keeping the 16th notes by percussing them with your pick on your pick guard while the chord rings out.

Essentially you will be working on two seperate rhythms at that point, one strum, one percussive...eventually you will be able to just skip the percussive part, and feel that staggered rhythmic pattern. 




 Father of two, boy 8, girl 5.

A lot of the behavior that you talk about when he was visiting the lab seems pretty normal to me, or at least age appropriate. My boy is not real "hands on" with new stuff, but he loves to learn new things and be around new things. I think that if he went to work with his uncle (not a scientist (how cool!) but road construction) he would love all the machines and cool stuff, but might be leery of actually getting involved. Some boys are different, and would be all kinds of hands on, to the point of seeming like mania.

The defiance could be described as normal for his age group as well. This is the time that they start to understand themselves, and he may be pushing the boundries to see what he can get away with. How's the mom and dad at home? If they're allowing this behavior to go unchecked or are unwilling disciplanarians, they might be fostering these sorts of problems. (When you describe impatience for future goals/rewards and change of situational difficulties, it sounds like he's maybe not getting negative reinforcement of these behaviors at home.)

The scaredness, (or timidness) that I sensed you were talking about might be something that you should watch. It could mean a lot of different things; from the relatively normal i.e. he's just sensitive/timid, to the relatively severe i.e. he's got something either real or imaginary to be scared of, and is acting on these feelings.

Overall, he sounds kinda like a normal eight year old boy to me, assuming all developmental skills are about where they are supposed to be. 

How's the relationship in between the boy and his parents? Are they stern enough in their demands about his diet, his habits, his bedtime ritual? Or are they enabling his bad behavior by not being resolute? Did this behavior maybe start as a reaction to the new child in the house? Hopefully there's no overt favortism between the two children. Without knowing much more, I can be of no help, but overall, outside of the timidness/anxiety he doesn't sound that much different from my boy.

 




 Duuuuuuddde...really? Out in the rain? Ouch.

Sad to say, you might be fucked. You might be able to fool the folks at Taylor (read that: Fraud), but if they want to see the demolished piece of art that was your 714, they will see the water damage. If your warranty is through Taylor, might be worth contacting them and telling them that you're an idiot and maybe, just maybe, they might take pity on you. Doubtful, but possible. Outside warranty, probably best to try to go with fraud. 

I'm sorry for your loss. Hope you have a backup box so you can still play the blues!
 




 1. 40

2. Full time manager

3. 14M (step-son, part time contact), 8M (at home), 5F (at home).

4. Job doesnt give me traditional weekday/weekend, but I have five work days, two off, so whatev. Typical day starts around 7am. Breakfast. One hour of either TV or video games. (assuming not a schoolday). One to two hours of self-play, generally in their rooms, sometimes outside. Together time until lunch. Lunch. Open afternoons, depends on what has to happen that day, sometimes errands, sometimes recreations, sometimes crafts. Dinner preparation is family time, dinner is family time. After dinner routine that leads to bedtime. Good is being a dad, stressful is getting young kids to do stuff together is like trying to herd cats. 

5. Struggling to make every day relevant, and stay involvled with the kids. I'm tired all the time, and work too much, so is tough to stay involved instead of just sleeping all day.

6. I don't really ever feel defeated as a parent. I generally feel that I'm doing a better job than most dads in similar situations.

7. Not really reliant on goods or services when it comes to the kids, but in the spirit of the question, would have to say either Netflix/Internet, or the Wii. They both allow the kids some time doing something that I only have to half supervise, allowing me time to do some grown-up things. 




 The very reason I can't suggest The Joy of Cooking enough is because it can be read *both* as a textbook **and** a cookbook. As far as skill set, there is an assumption that you've been in the kitchen before, but the "About" sections that preface each subject area covers more advanced cooking methods and such. Just a few days ago, I couldn't remember for the life of me how long to boil carrots (i could have just watched them, but I had other stuff on the stove, and that was the first step in a recipe) and I quick referenced my Joy so I could work on my timetable. 

Check your local library and see if they have a copy, and give it a looksee before you pull the trigger, but I wouldn't want to cook in a kitchen that didn't have The Joy of Cooking in it. 




 I have found that many people that have nearly fabulous handwriting hate their handwriting far more than I do...and I have the handwriting of a drunk monkey. Long ago I switched to an all caps scrawl (that I later learned was called Architectual Block Printing) that more easily conveys my message without error. Since switching, people have commented how neat my handwriting is, and I am nothing if not amused at what amounts to a utilitarian choice for legibility being appreciated for its form. 




 Hot Snakes? Awesome! I needed that phrase so badly; it's the holidays! Fuckin' hot snakes! Too broke for gold, have a orangered instead. 

Hot snakes....yessss. 




 A good friend told me that whenever I am faced with a difficult choice to flip a coin...not because you should trust in the random to decide your fate, no matter how small the issue, but because in that brief moment, while the coin is in the air, you will know what your heart truly desires.

I use it without fail. 




 Spend the 50 bucks on beer, get him drunk, take the axes, tell him he told you you could have them. 




 Had to be. Probably riverside, or near Pappa's. 




 I've seen some terrible things here in the N.S.B., but I've been lucky enough to avoid this. Must be mainland, shit like that just doesn't happen on the island. 




 Thank goodness for that giant red arrow. I wouldn't have been sure what to look at in that video. 

"Oh, look at all these people standing around watching something...meh, that's pretty cool, I guess"

"Wait, what's this red arrow?"

"Holy shit, a fucking elephant, fuckin' shit up!"

Thanks Red Arrow! 




 Yep, still checking the fish about whenever I bring new fish in...no questions on best preparations, how to clean/gut/scale, etc. 




 I am not familiar with the class, so my opinion may be uninformed, but I would think short of a professional culinary instruction in a classroom setting, that you would be wasting that $50.

First, take that $50 bucks, and buy [The Joy of Cooking](http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Cooking-75th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/0743246268/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1356534467 sr=8-1 keywords=the+joy+of+cooking)...not your typical "Cookbook"...it has plenty of recipes, but each section/chapter is prefaced with the "why" of cooking...why heat causes meat to brown, why you must scale certain types of fish, why herbs are best fresh, etc. Great book, and constant companion of mine while in culinary school, at home, and at work. And, you can spend that thirty bucks left over on something nice.

I don't know where you live, but any medium sized metro area is going to have classes offered on a single basis (i.e. outside a degree program). Check places that focus on alternative eating...fresh markets, vegetarian/vegan shops, etc...these places often will offer a single class on a single subject for a reasonable amount of dough.

And can't say enough about experience...one of the best ways to get a feel for your kitchen is to spend a lot of time in it! And take notes. seriously....if you are having problems with consistency when it comes to seasoning, start note taking and measuring what you're using, and then make notes about how you felt about the taste, adjust next time, take more notes, fine tune, end up with something that works for you, and is probably pretty tasty! 




 Right there with you. I brought it up to my wife, and she's given it a go a few times, but she says it's not her thing. Makes her happy to see me have a good time, but can't get her to initiate without having to almost beg. I think it's maybe more taboo for a female to be on the giving end of anal than it is to be on the receiving?...either way, it still makes me happy, and every now and then is better than never now or then, right?

 Depends on what you mean by artifacts. There haven't been people here for very long, but you can still find traces of them. I've personally [walked through a fort in Florida that was constructed in 1672](http://www.nps.gov/casa/historyculture/index.htm), [found bullets and a piece of a belt buckle at the sight of a civil war battle in Florida](http://battleofolustee.org/battle.html), [taken gravestone rubbings of some of the oldest graves in Northern Florida](http://www.seefloridaonline.com/_tallahassee/cemetery.html), and [got to see 120,000 year old mastadon bones dug up right in my city!](http://www.news-journalonline.com/article/20120929/NEWS/309299990/1064?Title=Prehistoric-passion-Mastodon-bones-draw-crowd-to-museum) 




 I hope you are who you are. I wish that you would message the mods some proof. Lacking that, let me begin...

I am so sorry for your loss. I know that means nothing, but I sat at work Friday morning, watching the coverage, and barely controlled my tears as I thought of those poor children, and those poor parents. My heart, and the thoughts of my entire family, have been with the parents and families of Sandy Hook for the past few days.

Question: How exposed were you to the media coverage, and what, overall, sort of job do you think the major media did to cover this story? And, do you feel that that sort of coverage is appropriate? Is this a tragedy for the nation, or should it have been a little more low-key?

 









 Dio!!! 




 I hear ya. I run a small club, and we limit to ten people, but we play way early on Thursday mornings on an uncrowded course, and stay very aware of people coming up behind us, usually giving way for playthrough a hole ahead of them. But that happens rarely.

More often, our group gets stuck behind a group of two or three that have never played before, and chuck plastic into the woods like there's no tomorrow, and most of the time, after explaining etiquette, and exchanging tips, we both go our serarate ways, happy...but not always....not always. 




 I love Fat Tuesday's! Used to have one here in Daytona, but they took it away from me! Now when I need delicious adult frozen beverages, I must buy them at 7-11, and pour FourLokos in them! But, a sad bonus, because of the 7-11 cup, I can bring them most anywhere! 




 I've taken a Jung test before, didn't really understand it too much. Found you guys, (/r/INTJ first, followed the link, took my test, looked for you, found you) and after a brief bit of googleresearch and reading through the posts here...wow. Just wow. Didn't realize that there were so many people like me out there. Happy to find you.

Minus sign  (  ) to exclude


Placing  a minus sign immediately before a word indicates that you do not want pages that contain this word to appear in your results. The minus sign should appear immediately before the word and should be preceded with a space. For example, in the query [ anti-virus software ], the minus sign is used as a hyphen and will not be interpreted as an exclusion symbol; whereas the query:  [ anti-virus software ] will search for the words 'anti-virus' but exclude references to software. You can exclude as many words as you want by using the  sign in front of all of them, for example [ jaguar cars football os ]. The  sign can be used to exclude more than just words. For example, place a minus sign before the 'site:' operator (without a space) to exclude a specific site from your search results.

 I'll be honest with you. I care. Really. I'm a father, 5 and 8, the same age as some of those kids that were shot and killed today. 

I'm a man, a burly manly, Ron Swanson type man.

I was at work, and had trouble controlling my emotions as I watched the events in Newtown unfold.

I don't know the families....but I have a family. I don't know the victims, but I felt like a victim, in a very very small way compared to what those people were dealing with, for the loss of innocence, of safety, of feeling like it was totally okay to drop my kids off at school in the morning, and know that they would be there when I showed up to pick them up.

I'm aware of the situation in the Congo, I know about the humanitarian crisis in most of sub-saharan Africa. I don't know much about Burma, but I've been following the stories out of Syria. Terrible things happen all the time.

But sometimes I forget that. I'm American. Most of the time, things are pretty okay here. 

Not today.

Sensationalism? I agree with you; if more attention was paid to the crises in other parts of the world, it might be easier to empathize with them.

But this was our home. Done by one of us. To some of us.

I made a FB post about it...I didn't know what else to do. I just wanted to cry, or to find my kids and hug them, and hold them close, knowing that they were okay, and that I could still protect them from the harsh ugliness of the world. I wanted to do more...more to help those people, more to feel like I was protecting my kids.

I don't grieve for them...I didn't know any of them, but I grieve for the innocence of my kids. I will spend a large portion of my day tomorrow talking about this with them; having a difficult conversation with two very young people that I care very much about, that I love more than anything else in this world; a conversation where I must admit, as their father, their protector, their rock, that yes, there are bad people in this world, the boogie monster is real sometimes, there might be someone that wants to do you and/or your family harm.

I'll tell them that the most important thing is to be careful, aware, and safe.

I'll tell them that we are a family, and that we will do anything we can to protect each other.

I'll tell them what I have to, to make them feel okay again.

And I wish that I could do that for the families that lost children today.

And I wish that someone could tell me that everything that I've worried about today was nothing. That I didn't have to worry about ever losing my children to violence or accident.

But today proved that no one can do that for me. And there are parents out there, right now, that learned an even more difficult lesson.

I may have no business grieving or not grieving for the pain and challenges of strangers, but I won't apologize for the emotions that I have as I witness the loss of these kids...the loss of these families...the loss that we *all* felt today, because of a silly notion of whether I have a right to or not. 




 No problem. It's hard sometimes when you realize how exposed our children are to the hurt and bad and ugly in this world. I'll be sharing something I learned from Mr. Rogers long long ago. Words from his mother... 

"When you see something bad happen, remember that there are helpers. If you look, you will find them, people that are helping other people. Know they are there, and find hope when you see them." 









 Yep, I saw those in the wild the other day, but didn't have the balls to buy and try...I was shopping with my wife; when I do, I leave the balls at home.

 GET OUT! GET OUT OF THE HOUSE NOW!! YOU STILL MIGHT HAVE TIME!!! HE WAS TRYING TO WARN YOU! RUN!!!!! 




 Florida is a "right to work" state.

I am a manager with about 30 employees here in Florida.

As far as I can tell, "Right to work" here in Florida means that "Right to fire your sorry ass whenever the fuck I want for no apparent reason, and good luck getting any Unemployment Compensation or Welfare, you stupid no job-having poor person!"

As far as I can tell, anyway. 




 Donny Osmond fronting Megadeth. Or Brittney Spears fronting GWAR. Either one, really.

  Discs do not fly out of your bag by themselves and hit trees.

I don't know, have you played a bad round with me before? It sure can seem like that...lol.

Seriously, glad to hear somebody else say it. I run a little club, and I see it all the time. New disc, show it off, throw it once, hook it, throw it in the sales pile. 




 Waxing! *slaps forehead...didn't even think of that. 




 Semi assembled. Free wheel assembly is done, crank assembly is done. 




 I'm putting together a new beach cruiser for Christmas. I'm confident in my abilities to do so, but had a few questions that you could maybe help me with?

* Gotta lube up those metal on metal parts, right? What lube? Silicone, 3in1, poly, teflon? What's best for me? (I live on the beach, btw.)

* Rust proofing! I live on the beach, and chrome is no match for the salt. What do? I bought a bike that has a minimum of chrome (handlebars, rims, and spokes)...how can I weatherproof these areas (hopefully semi-permanantly) so that they don't rust out?

* Any other tips and tricks that a noob like me needs to know before putting together a bike for the first time?

Thanks /bikewrench! 




 How much is this plastic frog figurine? 




 Fuck CC, they fired Bull from RealRadio 104.1 in Orlando. There's noise that they might be canning more.  




 Open mikes, open jams. Post your own CL add with clear expectations. Do some shitty gigs, and spread the word. Check sites like Bandmix.com. Keep trying. Takes time, so take your time. 




 I don't get depressed and I wouldn't let my kids get upset either. I like it when there is no one on the playground, it means Daddy gets to go wild! (A serious side note, as a father, a hairy, burly one, I often suffer from stares and watchful looks when on the playground with the kids, especially when I go (with them) by myself. It's a whole lot better when there is no one there.) 




 Long ago, Bill Cosby used to be funny. Why Is There Air is the beginning of his unfunny decline into the goofy faced jello pop slinging pudding pimp Huxtable shamed idiot that we all remember from Thursday nights at 8 in the '80's. Listen to it, it ain't so bad.

 Absolutely. I'm glad somebody said it. But while I have you here, what's the best thing for me to watch videos on my TV? Should I go with an off the shelf Roku, or maybe jailbreak an Apple TV with XBMC?  




 Not necessarily, remember that Stan knew something the rest of the Losers did not...[that It was pregnant](/spoiler), still not a gunslinger move, but [Susannah waved off the quest at the very end of her own choice as well.](/spoiler) Some things are too big, even for gunslingers; or, if you prefer, Roland was a gunslinger's gunslinger. 




 When I play alone, I can't get high...no focus. Fun to just fuck around with the guitar when I've been smoking, but not for practice. When playing with other people however, especially ones that I am comfortable with, it adds confidence and overall jamability. 

But maybe that's just me. 




 There be a crib up in New Orleans
They call tha Risin Sun
And itz been tha ruin of nuff a skanky boy
And Dogg I know I be one

My fuckin mutha was a tailor
Biatch sewed mah freshly smoked up blue jeans
My fuckin daddy was a gamblin' man
Down up in New Orleans

Now tha only muthafuckin thang a gambla needs
Is a suitcase n' trunk
And tha only time he be straight satisfied
Is when he be straight on a drunk

Oh mutha rap r children
Not ta do what tha fuck I have done
Spend yo' lives up in sin n' misery
In tha Crib of tha Risin Sun

Well, I gotz one foot on tha platform
Da other foot on tha train
I be goin' back ta New Orleans
To wear dat bizzle n' chain

Well, there be a crib up in New Orleans
They call tha Risin Sun
And itz been tha ruin of nuff a skanky boy
And Dogg I know I be one

 New Smyrna Beach, FL, sharkbite capital of the world! 




 Skinny girls. 




 Thats a really good idea, I'll float it to the club and see what we think.
 




 Planned on that...most of what I've seen so far has been about league play assuming handicaps were already figured, but I did do a pretty broad google. 




 And to keep score.  




 I gave the forums a cursory glance, and didn't see anything right away, but will check more when I get off work. I thought about two pools, but the group's not quite big enough for two or more pools yet. 




 Everybody has suggested that, and we thought about a "challenge day" of doing that very thing, but we play with someone who is ambidextrous...but we could make him play with his feet... 




 Will do, didn't think about looking there. Checked DiscGolfersR.us and didn't see much. 




 No, for real, I just don't get it. Anybody want to give me some tips? I want to take our little amatuer league to the next level, but I can't bring in better players and worse players than are already involved and keep it fun (and fair) for everyone.

So, how would you handicap a small club?

* We play on one course only (relatively easy, relatively short, highly technical)

* There are currently 10 players, but we want to expand.

* Co-ed.

* Skill levels from experienced to brand noob.

* Cash is involved, so must be fair, and managable.

* Once a week play, one round (18 holes) only. 




 I've been looking at those on amazon! I just don't know what the hell they are and what they do. Gonna have to do more research. 




 We checked that out at our local library, but I didn't see her get too excited about anything in it. I was thinking about something like books of patterns, or parts...like how to do pockets, corners, double seams, etc. 




 Well, I am the epitome of dudeness...she sews skirts, kids clothes, baby blankets, embellishments to store bought clothes...quilts a little (I'm assuming the definition of "quilts" as "stuffed squares sewn together"). She has a pinterest, but just started, and I know what's on it, but mostly stuff that falls into the "other crafts" category. She also does great work with over the shoulder bags. 




 Tough call. The Cameo looks like it would be better for what we do...(not just for sewing, we screenprint too). Have to think about that... 




 She's set as far as a sewing machine...for now. We've looked at some higher end options, but that's a later-on gift. A serger is something that she has mentioned. 




 I wouldn't even begin to guess about patterns and fabric for her! 




 She's a machine sewer mostly, but she does quilting as well.  




 I was thinking about GCs as well, but for the wife (that's why I'm asking) it seems a little impersonal, at least as the main gift.
 




 A serger might be a little out of my price range...but interesting. I don't know what they do, or if it would be appropriate as a gift for my wife, but the Cameo...a little pricey, but could work for a couple of different crafts. What do you think about lower priced comparibles to the Cameo Sillhouette? 




 Love those, but that would be a better gift for me than for her! 




 A light is something that I've been considering. Also scissors, because I'm husband, and kids. Would little stuff like pins, thimbles, needles, pincushions be safe? Or would you be super particular about what you get?
 




 I'm asking for ideas for my wife...isn't a husband buying his wife an iron grounds for divorce? But seriously, a nice iron would be a good gift? She has one, but it's older than our relationship...lol. 




 Lol...I'm a he, asking to get some ideas for my wife...I'm so lost when it comes to this stuff! (I'd love to get her a high end machine, but a grand is a little out of our budget!) 









 That comment just is begging for me to yell out "Your Mom!", but I think you're asking where I live? Volusia County, New Smyrna Beach, take 44 out of Eustis, head east until you hit the beach, and I'm on the right. 




 The easy answer is Space Monkey. Why? It's epicness is only overshadowed by the obvious need of my blank wall to support Space Monkey Art. I would hang this in my music studio (corner of my living room) and create a song about Space Monkey for Collage-o-rama. What you do with it at that point is up to you! 

Space Monkey Mafia, Unite! 




 I started surfing long long ago, but gave it up after I moved away from the coast. After many many years, I found myself back on the east coast of Florida, surrounded by new friends and decent waves. So I'll share the story of the first time I returned to surfing.

Some old friends of mine planned a trip to the coast to come see me and casually mentioned getting some wavetime in. I hadn't been surfing for about 20 years at that point, but figured what the hell, can't be too hard.

I went down to my local surf shop and picked up a used long board, 9.6 softtop, and told my friend that our weekend would be a go.

Over the next couple weeks as I waited in anticipation for good friends and good times, I tried to make time to get out and practice a couple of times, but just couldn't find time. (I work way too much).

The week before our surf weekend, checking the weather showed me that there was a storm developing. A big one. Might be Cat 1 hurricane, well offshore, by the weekend we had plans. Didn't worry too much, just thought we'd get some solid waves.

Nope.

The day before my friends came down, I went over to the shore to check the waves. It was washing machine time, but on steriods. The waves were big, but no rhythm, no sets, just muddy, and **angry** looking large chop.

I went home hoping for a better look the next day.

Friends showed up early, about dawn, and we checked the beach out immeadiately. If anything, it had gotten worse. My friends were determined to try it anyway, and I wasn't going to be the one to say no.

Two of my friends had some surf experience; long boards on the north florida gulf shore, and one was from some center of the country state that had never seen water larger than a lake, and didn't know jack about surfing.

So we get ready, and decide to have a couple of cans of liquid courage before we head across the street to defeat the monster. Heads held high, and feeling no pain, we carry our boards over to the shore.

We get out into the muck. My two friends with longboard experience have slightly less trouble than I do getting through the muck to search for the break, such as it was.

I had a moment where I knew things were going to go bad. My neighbors are all surf shop monkeys, and two of them were out in the muck, body boarding. As I struggled to get past the chop, one of them drifted close to me and said "you're either really brave or really stupid, bro!". I almost turned around at that point.

Almost.

By then, my friends are out trying to catch a few. Doing okay. The third friend, no surfing experience, is sort of just drifting down the beach, getting his ears washed out for him.

I finally get out of the mess, sort of on the back side of the break, and I straddle my board to catch my breath, and take in my surroundings.

Friends one and two are surfing. Not great, but there were waves, they were just short lived and messy. Friend three, no where to be seen.

Relaxing for maybe too long, I notice that I'm drifting not just down the beach, but out. I'm heading to Africa, so I paddle in a bit to try and catch my first wave.

I'm just paddling casually, not pushing hard, just coming in, and I feel a bit of upwelling lift me up. Out of nowhere, I've paddled on top of a monster. (It was a monster to me!) The wave develops underneath me, and I've surfed a bunch back in the day, but never saw a wave develop from that point of view, not on the face, not on the front, but teetering on top. 

I'm not so much paddling into the wave now as much as I'm falling into it, so I get up to me knees as I'm dropping in to this wave curling underneath me.

I surfed for about 1.6 milliseconds.

The wave buried me, tossed and turned, took a nasty hit from the board, had to push off the bottom to get a few whitewater breaths, tossed and turned, yanked by my leash, finally get my head above water, and start heading in.

I get to shore right about the time the lifeguard gets to me. I sort of plop down in front of him, he's asking if I'm alright, I'm embarrassed as shit, and tourists are gathering. One of them points out that I'm sitting a growing pool of blood. 

Kind of roll over to my side, and my upper thigh, right where it meets buttcheek, is total hamburgered. Took a fin in the crease. Friends gone, embarrassed enough, I wave off anymore help and hobble home to face the wrath of my wife.

Short wrap-up: I make it home, eventually first two friends make it back, we have beers and laughs. Friend three still missing. Finally shows up after hours, just drifted down the beach, and crossed the inlet, ending up in neighboring town, hitched a ride home with beach cops. Drank more, laughed more, did not surf more.

tl;dr. I'm old, don't drink and surf.

 You play hockey in a bathroom stall? Who wins? 




 Good luck. 




 Outstanding.

But your job isn't over yet. Now she knows. You must reinforce this feeling of universal oneness that's going to overcome her by sneaking 42 into her life even more, even more stealthily than before. Have fun! 




 It's just an Em7...you don't have to hate on it. I don't know of any specific song that "features" that chord, but it pops up everywhere. As an acoustic player with a decidedly chucka-chunka style, I use that chord, when it fits, to transition through a lot of chord changes with furious rhythm. 




 I wish you luck, fellow onomotophagic. I tried and tried and tried. I used hot sauce, no bite laquers, gloves, just about everything. It's a tough habit to break. 

Good news? It took six seperate attempts, a little bit of self-loathing, and almost two years, but I haven't bit my nails in a few months now (after biting for over 30 years) with some nice new growth, and going strong!

What finally worked for me was just positive thinking, and telling myself I could do it, and everytime I failed I learned something new about what triggers my addiction.  




 When my wife and I, before we got married, were visiting our doctor about her first pregnancy, his distaste in our unmarried state was evident. My at-the-time-GF and I got into a semi-serious accident on Thanksgiving, about halfway through her pregnancy. She began to suffer from some joint and bone pain in her right hip. We asked our doctor about it on our next visit, and I shit you not, he suggested that we get tested for "bone herpes". 

tl:dr A new study has shown that other people waiting until marriage to have sex makes people that already made that decision feel better about the years of self-repression and frustration that they suffered. 




 It's called [chocolate bloom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_bloom). It's either fat in the form of cocoa butter or crystalline sugar rising to the surface of the chocolate due to temperature extremes or the chocolate not being tempered correctly.
 




 That's a fun joint. Was just out there for the FolkFest last month.
 




 Where in Lake? I live in Volusia, NSB, but I'm in Eustis about once a month or so...my pops owns a place there....cheap beer and acoustic folk rock. [Olivias?](http://oliviascoffeehouse.com/index.asp) 




 Nope. Didn't even go to school here in NSB, didn't care much for high school, and you're describing the folks that I didn't care for when I was in high school 25 years ago. 

What I am is a football fan. HS, college or NFL, I like a good game, and this has been a good year for the 'Cudas. (I am also a fan of HS marching bands, my step-son plays baritone sax for the aforementioned Deland Bulldogs.) I just feel that this whole thing is getting blown way out of proportion. I've seen lots of HS ballgames this year, and years past, and there always is a little tension between the band and the players. They share the same field for warm-ups and pregames, and there just isn't much room at the high school level.  




 I live in New Smyrna Beach, the team that's doing the disrespecting...and we take our football seriously down here. Real serious. 

First, what they did was inappropriate. I hope they are running laps for it still...but the big deal that people are making about this here in the area, and to some degree state- and nationwide, is getting a little ridiculous. They ran too far out on the field? Relax. They'll run. But let's talk about the excitement of hs football here in this part of FL. NSB has swept the table, including big wins against cross county favorite, the Deland Bulldogs, (HS of Mike Gillislee, RB for UF Gators). They're the pick for the District champs this year. Been a few years since we've won Districts, so it's a big deal for the 'Cudas. Spruce Creek, while a great high school, is every other teams' punching bag. Never had a good football program out there, and this last game is sort of the last hurdle NSB Barracudas has to jump on their way to District play.

Creek's band should have been allowed the field to do their pre-game band thing, but let's not beat up a bunch of high school football players that are way excited about a great year of football.

I expect an apology from NSB will arrive at Spruce Creek anytime now, and I'll be wearing my Red and cheering on my 'Cudas next week. 




 It's called "crushing" or "crush fetish".

It's a type of paraphilia that some people get off on, sexually. (How? I don't fuckin' know.)

This chick, I don't know her name, but there has been a few of her vids bouncin' around the internet for a while. She's a "crush" star. (This one was bad...the one where she goes after kittens with high heels is worse.)

[Wikipedia on crushing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crush_fetish)

[And here's a story about a couple that did crush videos and got busted kinda recently.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2191787/Man-woman-arrested-torturing-animals-cutlery-household-tools-shoes-crush-videos-sexual-fetishists.html) 




 Jeezus, where to start?

* I think that if I only sing louder, people will think I sing well.

* I think that I can play guitar really really well. (I can, just not while shithammered.)

* I think that people care about my opinions.

* I think that people that don't care about my opinions will have their minds changed if I yell at them really loudly, causing spit to fly out of my mouth into their eyes.

* I think that talking louder helps me prove my point.

* I often forget my point.

* Whiskey dick.

* I generally will have three or more beers/cocktails working at one time.

* I can never, ever, find my smokes. 




 Women don't understand golf.
