 I was in Year 11 at the time but apparently some kid in grade 8 or 9 at the time took a piss in some girls make up bag or pencil case (I can't remember) because she apparently took his phone one time and sent some rude texts to some other girl in the same grade.  




 Channel 10 here in Australia does the same thing, its annoying AND they show ads in the middle of the race! The saddest part is that the UK broadcast of the Australian GP is better than Channel 10. 




 They would make a considerable amount of money buy releasing an official season pass to watch the race live on their site or through various media devices e.g game consoles (ps4/3, xbox one/360), apple tv etc. Have various camera angles that you can choose from and show stats etc on the side. That would be my dream.  




 As someone who lives in Sydney, Australia I would love to see Sydney purely for the novelty of exploring a virtual version of your own city.  




 I think IGN would have come out strong if they didn't say "officially cancelled", had they just stated that it was a strong rumour then they would have been fine but I guess they put a lot of trust into this insider, enough to say it's been officially cancelled.  




 Does anyone have a strong feeling that is some kind of marketing buzz for TLG? By saying that the game is cancelled it will remind gamers that the game was being worked on and now with Sony saying it's not cancelled the game will be firmly in gamers minds leading up to E3 




 If that's the case they should just eat right imo. You can still lose weight by cutting out the junk in a diet.  




 holy shit i'm from Sydney but even then I have never seen a monstrosity such as that! 




 Yeah I can't really remember all my choices however I do know that I made some pretty crazy decisions at the end. I would love to see how they handle the characters.  




 What's the general cost to own a basic car in Hong Kong? 




 To be fair though we actually see progress in an MGS game, they don't get announced and then show nothing about it for a long time. FFXV was announced when I was in Year 9 in high school. I am now about to finish my university degree and we still know nothing about the game lol.  




 Have they stated officially whether the save files from Witcher 2 will carry over? It will be a big decision as to what platform I buy the game on.  




 I had one where the guards were in a search formation together and I hacked one explosive at which point he threw it against the wall next to him which killed himself and 2 other guys.  




 Is it possible to see what your npc model is? 




 They could just get Harry Gregson Williams. He does the score for the games and has done a ton of films as well.  




 Everytime someone mentions Arrow F1 I think of [this silly front wing](http://cdn.carthrottle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2001-Arrows-A22-2_2714056.jpg) they had on their car at one point.  




 The sad thing is that even if you recast him the performance would have been the same since it was the writing not the actor that delivered a fairly wooden performance.  




 Where is it stated that his memory isn't wiped? I always thought that both C3PO and R2 had their memories erased in the conclusion of episode 3. 




 I really hope it's a God of War game with a new protagonist and setting. I know a lot of people would love Norse mythology to be a primary setting for a new one.  




 I have a feeling they will focus it more on Battlefront and then give another small teaser for Mirrors Edge 2 since that game is on the backburner until Battlefront is done. I'm alright with that that though since BF4 didn't exactly have the best launch so I really hope they take their time with Mirrors Edge.  




 If that's true then what would the USA do? They have a much larger sporting crowd that watch their own homesports with a lot more money involved (NFL,NHL,MLB and NBA). 




 Can Japan and Korea host it again? Since they hosted it in 2002. Is there a specific time lapse before they are allowed to host it again? 




 One thing that throws me off his not having the controller vibrate when you get an incoming phone call. 




 Wait I totally forgot about this guy? They never revealed who it was did they? 




 I believe it was to keep it in tone with the sequels. They had a more heavier green tone compared to the first original release.  




 I didn't mean to undersell her. To be honest I've only seen her in maybe 2 films, Chicago and Down with Love haha. 




 DVD's will be region locked however most Blu Ray's will be region free. I'm Australian and have imported numerous Blu Ray's from America and they have all worked fine. But yeah with DVD's you will be SOL :( I use this site to make sure a specific Blu Ray will work 

http://regionfreemovies.com/

I get that the PS4 is way more expensive in NZ than it probably is in HK however I think for warranty reasons its best to buy locally.  




 She seemed to be the woman who was in every film at one point and she wasn't a terrible actress, at least I don't think so. What happened to her career? 




 The Insider 




 You could try the Hills District. I went to The Hills Grammar School in Kenthurst and the school was located within a fairly large forest. Perhaps you could ask them for permission to shoot there? 




 I really hope the story is better this time around. The whole undercover cop thing had a lot of potential but they didn't do much with it story wise and it got fairly predictable towards the end.  




 I don't think it would happen again since the last crossover forced MK to be T rated because DC didn't really enjoy their characters getting torn apart.  




 Can anyone tell me what the legality of exploring a place like this would be? Does the council own it or is it privately owned etc? 




 If you liked Oblivion you will love Tron Legacy, it's made by the same director, Joseph Kosinski. That soundtrack and visuals are perfect.  




 Yep I was 14 when this game was announced and in Year 9 now I am in my final semester of university. Jeez this game has taken its time haha. I don't think it could live up to any sort of hype right now.  




 Holy shit that is truly amazing. 




 It's not required on consoles, it just acts as a little store where you can purchase in game items with the points you get from playing the game.  




 I've always adored the Phantom such a shame to see one in this condition.  




 I believe this is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioLQLRwTKS8) in question. 




 I was rather annoyed that we didn't really get to explore the meat of the city with citizens walking around etc. I remember they demoed a section of the game a few months before release and it had Nillin (I think that's her name) walking around the city with it being fairly occupied with citizens going about their daily business. 




 To quote the first Blade film I have always enjoyed the line: "Some motherfuckers are always trying to ice skate uphill" 




 holy shit that's insane. I saw the film but had no idea they used animatronics. Guess it was just that good! 




 My first time I got lucky and I just hid in a car on the side of the street parked next to other cars. He ran past me several times trying to find me. 




 Yeah down for me here in Australia as well 




 Hey do we have to preorder to get the DLC? 




 I feel that Star Wars: Underworld would be a good title as that's what the title for the planned live action tv series was based off. This is just me hoping that the Boba Fett film actually follows a darker, seedier tone seen in that original 1313 teaser.  




 I think you should check it out in my opinion it's definitely above average due to the fact that the characters are just so likeable and well written.  




 Yeah I have the game running on a 5.1 Surround mix and it's pretty abysmal, however if you run it through headphones it's a lot better.  




 Usually in engine cutscenes are of a higher resolution and polygon count when making the game and with the last generation of consoles (360,PS3) you would notice that the characters and environment etc would look a lot better than when you are actually playing the game. With the new consoles (PS4,XONE) this is not really an issue and they can get the game to look as good as its in game cutscenes. Hence why even though the trailer didn't show any true gameplay we can safely assume the game would look like that come release.  




 These all look like parody posters you would find in GTA or Seinfeld. 




 300, Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven (Directors Cut), Braveheart and I would also recommend Centurion which I enjoyed.  




 It was cancelled however if I were to speculate I would say that Viceral (makers of an unannounced Star Wars title) are retooling the game and maybe will announce it under a different name. 




 I thought they announced a while ago that it was pushed to 2015? 




 How much would it cost for Valve to resubmit the game for evaluation? Or is it free? 




 Man am I glad that this film wasn't about F1.  




 The PS4 cannot play locally stored audio files in game yet. You can use Music Unlimited which is Sony's version of Spotify to stream music in game while you play. I had created a playlist of my music and was playing it while in NFS Rivals at launch. But as of now you cannot listen to your own locally stored music while in game. 




 I imagine that they refocused their time onto GTA V and perhaps are making the game for PS4/XB1/PC? I doubt the game would be exclusive unless Sony ends up publishing but that seems rather unrealistic and doubtful in this current market. 




 As far as the state of New York is concerned you ARE the Assman. 




 It's just Maybach* haha and yes it had an electrochromic glass on the sunroof if I recall.  




 While RUSH (2013) sits on an 89% rating and 8.3 IMDB rating, I felt it was one of the films that sorely got overlooked especially during the Oscars. You don't even have to be an F1 fan to appreciate the film. Truly amazing in my opinion and Daniel Bruhl (Inglorious Basterds) kills it as Niki Lauda.  




 As someone who lives in Bella Vista, The Hills area in general is pretty chill, probably a lot more Christians in the population due to the advent of Hillsong Church which is kind of one of those youth mega churches you hear about in America. My uncle has a house in Castle Hill which is located on a street with other massive houses. His house was built in the 80s though so that street has old but massive houses which all border a fairly dense forest. The people are quite nice for the most part, definitely a welcome change compared to people around or near the city in my opinion.  




 I highly doubt there will be a teaser for TLOU shown. If the bolded parts of the leaks are true then I believe that they would show The Last Guardian at the very end of the conference kind of like a "but wait here's one more surprise" and boom they show The Last Guardian.  




 Amazing! 




 That's fucking retarded if that's true. Seriously he's a lawyer not a fucking bad ass super cop. Should have cast someone with less of a pull on the film.  




 Man of Steel felt like the closest thing to a real DBZ film. 




 This is such a fantastic show it really is in my top list. Great story which is now even more relevant in the whole recent NSA scandal which they tied in perfectly and fantastic characters.  




 Love the MP3 controls, seems like the kind of character that would want to listen to music while swinging around. 




 Auto updates and doesn't need the disc to update. All of my PS4 games are retail and I haven't had to put the disc in to update/complete the update of  game.  




 Australian citizen here, Jeep Cherokee's have always been quite popular here and I have also seen quite a few Chrysler 200's around. While the most common car you see here is a Holden Commodore (Chevy SS). Importing a Mustang, Corvette, Viper or Camaro is uber expensive as you have to get a RHD conversion and I imagine servicing the car would be stupidly expensive. Personally I love the designs of all 3 of those cars, it's just a shame they are so expensive.  




 So I have been rocking my Galaxy Nexus since 2011 and I want to upgrade to a Nex 5, is the battery life a substantial improvement over the GNex? Reason I am asking is that I know the battery life of the Nex 5 compared to some new phones such as the HTC One M8 and Galaxy S5 isn't the best but if it's a massive improvement over my G Nex it'll push me more towards it.  




 No, I have a 2013 328i with an M-Sport package and the only things that denote anything M-Related are the door sills, wheels and steering wheel. There is no external M badging on the body of the car.  




 I actually like this scene would have been nice if they remastered it and included it in the blu ray cut. Your score is excellent btw. 




 Glad that didn't happen it would have been too much in an already long film.  




 I use Xbox Music on my Surface Pro 2 and while I also have my entire iTunes library on the computer I mainly use it because the UI is a lot better + you can import your entire iTunes library into Xbox Music (at least on the sufrace). It pretty much functions like Spotify so I am just on the free account which lets me listen to pretty much anything except their are ads of course.  




 I like that this is a more contemporary looking UI compared to The Machine's UI, in a way it feels more threatening compared to The Machine. 




 Ohhh right wow haha didn't know that.  




 Wait what it's not my birthday though :( 




 I assume Cameras/Film/Music and PlayStation 




 Ben Afleck? 




 Anyway to view said videos on the PS4? E.g Can I copy a movie over and watch it on my PS4 yet? 




 Press X to chainsmoke. 




 Can't blame them, a dark period of fashion was fast approaching. 




 I wouldn't mind seeing some of the themes the Clone Wars explored, mainly being that grey area of dark and light. It raised very valid points about the Jedi order being power hungry and controlling in their own way. I think Knights of the Old Republic explored these themes extremely well through the character of Kreia. It made you look at the force in shades of gray rather than just pure black and white. 




 I'm afraid I haven't read that just yet but I plan to get on it very soon! 




 Supposedly the on hiatus/cancelled? tv show Star Wars Underworld was going to be based around a criminal underworld.

"Basically, it is like 'The Godfather'; its the Empire slowly building up its power base around the galaxy, what happens in Coruscant, which is the major capital, and its  about a group of underground bosses who live there and control drugs, prostitution..."
Rick McCallum

 




 Always liked [Dooku's](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/File:DookuSaber-MR.jpg) lightsaber purely just because it was very unconventional looking, compared to the ones seen in the films at least 




 Is the weather display on the main screen a US/Europe only thing? I don't think the Australian models do that here or have Connected Drive for that matter.  




 Probably the Matrix for me. Just really made me think bigger.  




 The marketing blitz for Episode 7 is gonna be some next level shit. 




 I like the BMW shifters. [Here](http://lifestylesdefined.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BMW-I8-Key-Not-Just-A-Key-2.jpg) is the i8 shifter which is similar to current BMW shifters.  




 Hah here in Sydney if you look under 25 they will ask you for ID. I never get asked though and I am 22, the beard helps haha 




 I find that if you just grow a beard, wear a flannel shirt and jeans then you will be instantly cosplaying as joel forever.  




 I guess I would rather wait then have endless filler like DBZ. 




 Forgive me for doubting you but haven't they explicitly said the game will be released when it's ready, as in they haven't committed to a release date.   




 I really hope it's a new main character and cast, I would like to truly believe that Shepard's story is over. This is the kind of game that would really lend itself to next gen hardware.  




 After the Phantom Pain I hope he is able to step away from MGS and perhaps make a fully reimagined version of Snatcher or even a new IP.  




 Here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/cNgMg) which contains screenshots  from GPU-Z and the catalyst control center which show the temperatures. Some followup I had restarted the PC which showed regular temperatures however the fan was still going into overdrive as you can see the RPM they are running at is stupidly high. 




 So my specs are:

CPU: i7 2600k 3.4ghz (not overclocked)
GPU: AMD Sapphire 6970 2gb (not overclocked)
HDD: Samsung SpinPoint F3 1TB HD103SJ	
PSU: Silverstone Strider Plus 600W ST60F-P	
MOBO: ASRock Z68 Extreme3 Gen3 Motherboard	
OS: Windows 7 Home Premium
RAM: G.Skill Ripjaws F3-12800CL9D-8GBRL 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3	

So basically everything was running fine until yesterday I decided to play some Titanfall then maybe a minute into the game the fan on my GPU went into overdrive it sounded like a jet engine. It has been doing it ever since now when I turn it on it goes into full overdrive and stays like that, GPU-Z said the fan was at 100% and the temperature was at -165 celsius, so something is defintely not right. Any help on what's going on would be much appreciated. 




 It looks like India, so yeah no helmets is standard.  




 For me it was Grim Fandango when I was younger, you had to get use the forklift in a moving elevator to stop it on a certain floor and I could never get it right.  




 Song: Enter One
Artist: Sol Seppy

for anyone curious.  




 Yeah he wasn't a bad bond by any means he was just dealt shitty scripts after Goldeneye. 




 This is a serious question and may sound really dumb but if one submits themselves into a psychiatric hospital do they have to pay for services etc after they leave?  




 Is FC4 reportedly set in the Himalayas? If true I really hope they bring in the wing suit for that shit. 




 Can they not put a different looking button though that performs the same function? 




 I imagine that generally a trophy where you have to get all multi-player unlocks or get the highest rank would be the rarest. In this case I feel a game like Tomb Raider or AC4 may have some of the rarest trophies since I can't imagine that too many people are playing those games online.  




 While it's more of a re-adaptation of the book I think Fincher's Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was much better than the Sweedish version.  




 That could be likely but SS was younger at the time and in peak condition compared to a Big Boss who was older and battle worn by the time of MG 2 




 Is it one of the Samsung Galaxy models? 




 Maybe this had already been pointed out but I noticed it for the first time at lest. In the Phantom Pain trailers where Snake is in the hospital it appears he is a lot skinnier and has lost a lot of muscle as a result of being in a coma and not being able to work out obviously. Just a small but nice detail that adds a lot to the character I think! 




 I'm assuming he is referring to Mark Webber who raced for Red Bull up until this year, he was known for having some pretty rotten luck on the track especially compared to his team-mate, Sebastian Vettell who is a 4 time world champion.  




 I was wondering why I saw Steve Irwin in my showing haha
