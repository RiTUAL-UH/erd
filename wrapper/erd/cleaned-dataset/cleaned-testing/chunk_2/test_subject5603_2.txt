 The justifications are different, but the goal is always the same, concentrating wealth and power at the top.  




 Excellent, Now if we just figure out how to bring in 'Fast and Furious' and Solyandra into the picture, and convince ourselves everything is  part of a United Nations plot to take away our guns, we'll have a Unified Obama conspiracy theory going. 




 Twist: They're even more scandalous! 









 Adults admit when they've made a mistake, children try to blame someone else.  




 I don't have any particular insights into what went on at the IRS, but it certainly doesn't pass the smell test.  What I object to is someone as dishonest as Ryan grandstanding over anyone else's veracity.   




 The congressman with 21 statements rated False, Mostly False and Pants on Fire by [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/paul-ryan/) and earned 13 Pinocchios from the [WP FactChecker](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/paul-ryan-added-to-the-pinocchio-tracker/2012/08/26/eb76222c-ef95-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_blog.html ) when he was running for Vice President is accusing someone else of lying.  Maybe the IRS officials are lying, maybe they aren't but Ryan has no standing to accuse anyone else of dishonesty.  




 Do you think Fox published a similar list about the Bush-Cheney administration 8 years ago.  A list that includes  9/11, resistance in Iraq, lack of readiness for Katrina, economic meltdown in 2008? I'm guessing not. 




 His reputation seems to have [held up](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/209438-poll-bill-clinton-most-admired-recent-president ). 




 I don't know if I agree. Michelle Bachmann was threatening to corral it for a while.  Not to mention Rick Perry and Herman Cain. There's lots of competition in the GOP for the gullible, small brained voter. 




 Appears that Huckabee is making a play for the imbecile vote.
 




 Somehow, I have a feeling that George Will is already writing a column praising Dick Cheney's latest venture.  




 Unfortunately,  he didn't do so well with domestic issues which cost him his re-election. Great foreign affairs President though.  




 Absolutely on the money. Germany has [higher labor costs](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/german-labor-costs/) than the US, but manages to compete successfully in the world economy.    




 The internet could be managed as a public good, or it could be managed for profits of corporations.  Patents, labor rights, access to education, rules to regulate corporation, etc, all these things are legal and societal choices and greatly influence who will benefit from advances in technology.   




 Jackson did stuff South Carolina during the nullification crisis.  Other than that I don't find much to like in his record.  The treatment of Indians in the South is inexcusable.  




 GHWB was a mixed bag, but he deserves full props for managing the international situation during the disintegration of the Soviet Union.  That could have been a nightmare (the news from Iraq provides one possibility), but he managed to keep US - Russian relations on an even keel. 




 Here's one [example](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/science/05legal.html?pagewanted=all). 




 Hardly,  If we chose to,  technology could provide well for everyone with shorter work weeks.  But instead, we've opted to give the gains from technology to a small elite. 




 I suppose Marco Rubio will start telling us, "I'm not an insurance agent,Man". 









 Kind of like a has been athlete, still hanging on, hoping to recreate his glory days.  Or a washed out classic rocker (who would be Will's contemporary) ,turning out stale rehashes of his successes. 









 Easy to make up. Just cut education and social services again.  




 Yeah it's already been four minutes, the pro-gun boys must be off their game.  




 Sounds pretty close to the qualifications George W. Bush brought to the office. The record of businessmen in the Presidency is [unimpressive](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2012/02/17/sorry-mitt-romney-good-businessmen-rarely-make-good-presidents).  




 War and politics are inextricably linked, especially in a democracy.  A democracy can only fight a long war with the consent of the citizens.  And if you want to see an example of the civilian President knowing how to fight the war better than the military expert, read about Lincoln and McClellan.  




 You know who was a really successful businessman?  Herbert Hoover.  Success in one field doesn't always translate into political skill.  A politician needs to be a different kind of leader than a business executive.  




 Poor Eric.  Maybe the House can have another vote to repeal Obamacare.  That always seems to make him feel better. 




 Franklin Roosevelt bent a few rules getting the US ready for WWII, especially in aiding Britain and the USSR while the US was still neutral.  I don't think history has accused him of trampling democracy.  Probably saved it.

 Check the credentials of the authors and co-authors at the [end of the report](http://heartland.org/media-library/pdfs/CCR-IIb/Full-Report.pdf).  Only 1 of the 4 might qualify as a climatologist.  Oh, and the Heartland Institute also thought [this billboard](http://www.livescience.com/20107-heartland-climate-change-billboards.html) was a useful thought in the debate about global warming.   




 Sure they're serious, but as the article concludes:

But reform conservatism must still prove itself to be more than a slogan, more than a marketing campaign, more than that new pizza box. The Reformicons can be part of the historic correction the conservative movement badly needsor they can settle for being sophisticated enablers of more of the same.

Right now reformers have no meaningful influence in the Republican Party.

 Around 1 out of 13 voters showed up in Texas, and our first lesson is that strange things happen when you hold an election and nobody comes. You can, for instance, wind up with a hard-right nominee for attorney general who violated state securities regulations and then excused himself by pointing out that the law was very complicated.
 









 I feel that a concentration of power in anyone's hands is a danger to us all. At the moment the biggest issue is the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of few outside government is a far bigger threat. At another time it might be the government.  Do you think Wall Street loves you better than the government?  




 I halfway agree with you.  The Republican Party is the only thing that manages to make the Democrats look good. 




 Opinions are so much more convincing when they're capitalized and in bold, aren't they?  Not to mention that it saves a lot of valuable time that you'd need to waste looking up sources or constructing an argument. 




 Well, it's hard to dispute logic and sourcing like that.  Also spelling. 




 The public is clearly with Republicans in opposing the law in its current form, and that's why the GOP's broad opposition is likely to continue. Republicans don't need to weaken their opposition to Obamacare**they need to find something they would like to do instead**.

I love these articles. The authors never seem to pick up that the Republicans **never find something they would like to do instead**. Or rather they always want to do the same thing instead, which is lower taxes on the wealthy.

Grammar edit 




 Considering Bush left him two wars, an economy in shambles and a civilization threatening climate problem (Sorry,but I think scientists usually know what they're talking about) , and he had to deal with a Senate that set the record for filibusters and a House that came close to causing a default on the national debt because it wanted to pitch a tantrum about the ACA, I'd say he's done all right.  Of course Dick Cheney is still eligible to run for President, if you'd like a repeat of the Bush administration. 




 He should start campaigning as 'A Politician with Flexible Principles'.   




 And he's having an affair with [Beyonce](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant ion=1 espv=2 es_th=1 ie=UTF-8#q=obama%20rumors%20affair).  And he's [gay](http://www.wnd.com/2012/09/claim-obama-hid-gay-life-to-become-president/).  At the same time! 




 It appears Republicans have gone past denial and reached the [bargaining stage](http://psychcentral.com/lib/the-5-stages-of-loss-and-grief/000617) about the ACA.  Here's hoping they make it to acceptance. 




 Allen West has a [very active imagination](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/apr/11/allen-west/allen-west-says-about-80-house-democrats-are-membe/). 




 If things follow the pattern of last couple of 'scandals', the denials will be refutations of Republican's dishonesty.

We can around and around pointing out our favorite hypocrisy on the other side, but it won't change anything.  We can decide we want a society that tries to include the less successful or pushes them down harder.  If we're committed to inclusion, their lives will improve. If we aren't (and I don't think we've ever made more than a half-assed effort), we won't . 




 Debates on guns in American lead me back to the old joke. 'Statistics are like people, you can torture them until they say anything you want them to'.  Pro or anti gun we can all find a study that proves guns make us safer or guns make us less safe. 




 I'm OK with that, (or a negative income tax or a guaranteed minimum income)  but I think it's the [conservatives blocking it] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_duckies).  Not every conservative of course, but there seems to be a sadistic faction that delights in making life harder for the least successful and unfortunate.  




 In general ...  I suppose there are exceptions, but when someone titles their article as The truth about 9/11, or The truth about Christianity or The truth about the Holocaust, or The Truth about  anything else, I expect an opinionated one-sided screed. 




 Maybe, maybe not.  [The Economist] (http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21591593-moderate-minimum-wages-do-more-good-harm-they-should-be-set-technocrats-not?zid=309 ah=80dcf288b8561b012f603b9fd9577f0e) thinks that 'Moderate minimum wages do more good than harm'.   




 Sources that call themselves 'The truth about ...' usually aren't. 




 The minimum wage hike is causing Hardee's to shut down restaurants? Talk about your unexpected benefits! 




 Mr. Tol, a lead author on one of the panels working groups, said the field of climate research suffers from alarmist bias and groupthink.
 
This is the latest clever smear on climatogists. Instead of acknowledging a scientific consensus exists, dismiss it as "groupthink".  




 Why, oh why, don't the Democrats drive this issue?  90% of us live off our paychecks, and I don't think many of us like the idea that someone can be cheated out of their earnings. 




  ... the longtime senator also spent some time promising to push a constitutional amendment if he disagrees with the Supreme Courts ruling in the Hobby Lobby case, vowing that everybody will support his new constitutional language, except the nuts. Hatch also reportedly took the opportunity in his remarks to assail the nations courts and urge voters to cast their ballots for Republicans in 2014 and 2016." The senator added, I shouldnt talk like that, but Ive reached an age that I can say whatever I want.

Apparently "I'm a rude, old asshole." is now an excuse.  
 









 I'll be OK with it, as long as the terms include Walker's exile from Wisconsin.  




 Cheney is a particularly puerile, putrid , peccant, prevaricating pissant.  And if you don't limit yourself to the P's, [the possibilities are abundant](http://grammar.about.com/od/rhetoricstyle/a/How-To-Rant-Bernard-Levin-S-All-Purpose-Invective.htm). 




 Now if only they'd admit that they're similarly unable to understand economics, defense, or basic human decency,voters would stop listening to them.   




 I sure hope voters figure out that Paul isn't much of a libertarian.  He's more of a boy-toy for the bankers and billionaires.  




 Most conservative politicians want to, above all,  protect the interests of their monied supporters. They'll jettison their culture war positions when they're no longer useful. 




 Or in other words, 'I don't want to be the last rat on a sinking ship.' 




 In addition, Gerber is encouraging all the areas Dutch Oven chefs to plan on attending and preparing their favorite recipe to share with the crowd. Andy Boyer of Elko will be on hand driving a chuck wagon pulled by a pair of mules.

 In the Washington Post's 2016 Candidate [Fact checker page] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/tag/2016-candidates/), Rand Paul now leads all contenders with 18 Pinocchios. Next closest in Ted Cruz with 8.  Hard to believe there is someone more that twice as dishonest as Ted Cruz, but I guess Paul is the man. 




 Paul Ryan has never had a meaningful piece of legislation passed in all his years in Congress, but I'd say he's had a big impact.  Like Ryan, Warren is forcing these issues into the public discussion. 




 I think he misunderstood.  People are most likely asking him why he's such a wiener. 




 Repeat until understood. 




 Why not both?  




 It's hard to imagine, but Wisconsin once had a reputation for aboveboard and clean politics.  Looks like we've got that turned around completely .

 Sam Wang is the best data analyst studying elections.  And he does it [on the side] (http://bigthink.com/users/samwang) .  









 My family is from a northern Scottish island, and I'm not built for Mississippi  weather.  How my fellow Scots adapted to the weather in the American South, I can't imagine.   




 I was once in St. Louis in August, and cool is the last word I would use to describe it. I'm a Midwestern fellow so I was accustomed to the heat, but the humidity, brutal. 




 You're assuming that all the people with guns would join in fighting the government.  I imagine some of them will join the government in wiping out the revolutionaries.  




 [Maybe, maybe not.](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/books/in-gunfight-adam-winkler-traces-the-gun-control-battle.html?pagewanted=all)
Although some gun-rights advocates talk as though gun control were a modern, 20th-century invention of an increasingly meddlesome government, the historical passages in Gunfight suggest otherwise. Not only did the nations founders balance gun rights with public safety needs, Mr. Winkler says, but the wild, wild west wasnt all that wild. According to the research of one scholar he cites, almost everyone carried firearms in the untamed wilderness, which was full of dangerous American Indians, outlaws and bears, but in the towns where people lived and businesses operated, there were often blanket ordinances against the carrying of arms by anyone. One of the towns with strict rules was the notorious Dodge City, Kan. 




 Perhaps a mass murder takes the edge off them for a few days. 




 Really?  Then perhaps I'll start posting more. 




 Thus the unsurprising discovery: Virtually every reference to the right of the people to keep and bear Arms  the second part of the Second Amendment  was in reference to military defense. Waldman notes the House debate over the Second Amendment in the summer of 1789: Twelve congressmen joined the debate. **None mentioned a private right to bear arms for self-defense, hunting or for any purpose other than joining the militia.** 









 American agriculture could adopt new technology rather than focusing solely on immigrant workers, Krikorian argued. "When you have unending sources of low-skill foreign labor, the incentive to automate is weaker."

 




 Looks like Mitch McConnell has moved on from evasions and half truths right on up to the straight lie. 




 At five months out, nothing is a done deal in US elections. 









 I think OWS accomplished more than you give yourselves credit for.  Income inequality was a fringe topic before OWS, and you brought it into the mainstream.   




 For an argument that will anger an entire section of the country, here's [hypothesis that argues that American violence rooted in southern culture] (http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/The-312/July-2012/American-Violence-and-Southern-Culture/).   




 Dammit, and I was so proud that I managed to spell Feingold correctly.  




 Wisconsin is the home both 'Tail Gunner Joe' McCarthy and 'Fighting Bob' LaFollette. We're the state that failed to re-elect the progressive Ross Feingold and two years later, elected Tammy Baldwin, the first openly gay Senator. Pretty much anything can happen here. 




 And ha! 




 Never thought of that.  Republicans are always claiming they want to return America to its origins.  I guess they're going a little further back than we suspected.  




 They're just covering all the bases. 




 If voter ID proponents we're truly interested in making sure we had honest elections, they'd address this issue as well.  But somehow, they never quite seem to get around to it. 




 [Insurance companies] (http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0517/Climate-change-lawsuits-filed-against-some-200-US-communities) are starting to worry about the payouts climate change will cause.  Nothing like a change to the bottom line to get business groups interested in a problem. 




 I'll never understand why the Democrats don't make an issue of wages (and not just minimum wage).  90% depend on our paychecks, and the Republicans seem largely interested in keeping them smaller in favor of larger profits.   




 The Republican Party = Making America a high profit, low wage Paradise. 




 Apparently, insurance companies are now falling for the climate change hoax as well. /s 









 I've been wondering about this for some time, and Igbo provide another data point.  Are there any societies that 1) place a premium on education and 2) haven't been successful economically?  Even if there are a few counterexamples, it does seem dedication to education is a leading indicator of how successful a ethnic, religious, and even geographical (compare Massachusetts with Alabama) group is likely to be. 




 Or addressing environmental issues?  Or income inequality?  The sudden change of opinion on same sex marriage gives me hope that American opinion might turn quickly on other issues. 




 He sure does 'evolve' quickly to the prevailing political trends.  He ought adopt a jellyfish as his mascot. 




 Ripping off a song you heard by another performer and trying to take credit for writing it? Here's [somebody else](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Got_My_Mojo_Working#Litigation) who did  that .  It's as old as the blues, and probably almost as old as music. 
Still I think Led Zeppelin has been notably egregious in borrowing and not giving proper credit.  The worst case  was "Bring it on Home", where Robert Plant imitates Sonny Boy Williamson for the first verse and chorus and the song's ending, yet Williamson and Dixon received no credit. (Jimmy Page tried to dismiss it an homage to Sonny Boy, and claimed it was 'only a few seconds of music'.) Compare them to the Rolling Stones , who covered many old blues songs and always gave credit, used blues bands for their opening acts and even got Howling Wolf a slot to perform on Shindig!  




 If you want to know what a study concludes, look who paid for it.  This study was paid for by the American Enterprise Institute.  




 There has always been a strain of [anti-intellectualism in America] (http://www.amazon.com/Anti-Intellectualism-American-Life-Richard-Hofstadter/dp/0394703170).  Fox News and such are the latest manifestation.   




 They'll never wise up.  You can fool some of people all the time ... and those are the people you want to concentrate on. 




 If they follow the same pattern as they have on Medicare and Social Security, give them a few election cycles and they'll be claiming the Democrats are undercutting the Affordable Care Act, 




 Assuming we have a just God, I'd say that's about right. 




 Really a remarkably disingenuous article. When Medicare D  was implemented  [there were a significant problems as well.] (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/13/steve-israel/medicare-part-d-and-obamacare-health-care-gov/) . Like Medicare D, ACA will improve over time.   




 I believe the study you cited (from the Cato Institute) is what we usually call [B.S.](http://www.businessinsider.com/does-welfare-really-pay-better-than-work-2013-8).  Do you think we'd have a 15% to 20% poverty rate if welfare paid that well? 




 Karl Rove is the dung beetle of American politics. 




 Next time someone tells you both parties are the same direct them to this editorial.   









 I didn't say he was particularly smart (or particularly stupid, if it's the rest of US congress we're comparing him to), just unpredictable.
