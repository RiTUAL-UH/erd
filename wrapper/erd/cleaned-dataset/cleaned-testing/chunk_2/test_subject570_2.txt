 Iranian regime at its best. 





























 The evening view from their terrace is really priceless. 




 I pretty regularly use a National Express coach A6 from Stanested to Victoria (it stops at Golders Green, Finchley Road, Baker Street before it reaches London Victoria). There is also a Stanested-Stratford rute A9 http://www.nationalexpress.com/coach/Airport/stansted.aspx It costs 10, and return costs 17. I suggest you to buy a weekly Travel Card - Oyster card at any Tube or Overground station in London for Tube/Bus/Tram/DLR/Overground train in London area/ you've even got a discount on River Thames Clippers http://www.thamesclippers.com/routes-times-prices-booking/routes-times-prices-booking.html  There is a refundable deposit of 5 per Oyster card http://www.visitlondon.com/travel/oyster/ 




 Just another 'bad' habit to embrace in London to remain safe, while using public transport (I learned it hard way some 7+ years ago between Mornington Crescent and Camden Town) 




 Sadly, their chips have become just another 'the economy of a scale' victim. 




 Aren't those slightly louder girls also being called ladettes? 




 I fully share your feelings and I need to admit that I get very emotional at this point: "upon returning from another country, looking out the aeroplane window across our neat and orderly patchwork of fields/hedgerows" 





















































































































































 I've taken a side.. as a part time photographer, I simply never upload my photos to stock sites anymore.. the copyright theft out there is insane 




 Spot on. Avoid the rush hour in London, if possible! Summers are terribly hot and humid. The price of a daily ticket is about 7+ if you buy it in the morning, and you can use it on all buses, DLR, and overground trains in the same zone. 




 and now is falling to pieces again...what a frighful experiences on Jubilee line almost every day...and they never forget to charge more and more 




 Use it badly, pls 




 they'll ignore him 




 more links like this, the better - "Louis Vuitton Whores" 




 I see what you did there, Sir 




 OMG ... "But while Manning's punishment is cruel, it is far from unusual. According to available data, there are some 25,000 inmates in long-term isolation in America's supermax prisons, and as many as 80,000 more in solitary confinement in other facilities. Where is the outrage  even among progressives  for these forgotten souls? Where, for that matter, is some acknowledgment of their existence?" 




 Thank you, Sir! (if only my teacher would have read your words some years ago) 




 ...just imagine how fast they could sort out all those tax havens if they really wanted to 




 This somehow reminds me of PM Gordon Brown and the UK gold reserves he had sold so badly... (at the worst possible moment at least) 




 Seconded...I'd love to, but...(like we're not from the same material) 




 Pretty cute, indeed 




 RIP Benoit
