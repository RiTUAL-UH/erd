 Laminate that looks like granite. Don't care about cost really, I'm just looking for what style/colour will go well. It's a medium size area, my entire kitchen countertop.  




 Hey guys, so I'm redoing my kitchen and need a new counter top to match my existing cabinets and floor tiles.

I'm not the best with colours and all that, so I'm looking for suggestions on what colour/style to get! Thanks! 




 Into CDR or CHD?

Currently running a lightning build with about 30% CDR, not sure what to reroll into CDR or CHD.

 Hammer is my main Dmg spender, still worth rerolling to CHC?
