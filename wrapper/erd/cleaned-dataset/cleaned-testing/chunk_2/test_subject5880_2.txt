 I want to help pay this kids bail. It's $140. Can anyone figure out where the money goes to / how to get it to this kid?  




 Got a scratch off as a kid for my birthday. Won $100. Put it in my dirt bike fund. Purchased a dirt bike. Didn't understand that it didnt have an automatic transmission. Drove it for two hours at redline for 2 hours. Blew up the dirt bike.

 Depression. I wanted to try anything to medicate myself, couldn't find anymore weed, and while considering ending my life back then, there didn't seem to be much of a consequence. I started with just one a day as a reason to get out of bed in the morning. That number went up over the course of about two plus years. I then quit using electronic cigarettes. Check out /r/electronic_cigarette .

 Ahahah, nice catch!  




 I had just moved in, living with a friend of mine and his family. Me and my friend both shared a room, with me on top bunk and him on the bottom,  and I made a point to screw with him every now and then. My friend was out for the night, not going to return until late, and I knew that he was out smoking and would come back home still super high, as he had done the last couple nights before. 

I took some of his clothes, put them in his bed, and filled them with rolled up towels, ie pajama pants with rolled up towel legs with a bit of towel sticking out the bottoms - just enough to place socks on the end. I used a backpack to imitate the size of a torso, towels as arms, and a snowboarding helmet as a head.

I then covered the fake person in his bed with the blanket, leaving the feet sticking out, making it look like a person was passed out in his bed face down.

Fast forwarding, I'm up on the top bunk and I hear his car pull in. He heads up to his room, turns the lights on, and just stares in disbelief at his bed for several minutes straight. He doesn't move, just stares, trying to comprehend what the hell is going on, why there are no extra cars in the driveway, so who is passed out on the bottom bunk? Eventually he just couldn't handle it. He turns the lights off and walks out. I then hear a car door close, engine start, garage door open, followed by him just noping the fuck out and leaving to go sleep somewhere else.

 This has been posted on TIL before.  




 Not so much insight, just lots of experience with it working on the fogger. The screws naturally rise out a bit by themselves in the fogger, and screwing them down tight keeps the resistance low, however if I want an ohm or two higher, I'll keep one of the screws slightly less tight.  




 There are two resources I can't recommend enough.

People call all the time. I've called twice and it's a great resource to have. 

I've also had this same struggle of a wonky sleep schedule due to depression, and the inability to gather thoughts due to anxiety. I always feel like I'm sad as hell, but don't know exactly what or how to talk about it. Going to sessions again and again makes it easier and easier to collect thoughts - it's hard and I feel like it's almost something that takes practice. 

Best of luck, friend. 

 




 She's pretty! Looks good!  




 Veritas, for sure.  




 I'd say to feel free to make your own thread asking this question. This shouldn't be limited to a reddit breaking "daily questions" thread. 

Just about everyone starts smoking underage, they just stay quiet about it. Vape at whatever age you want to if it is the only way you can quit smoking.  




 I've got the opposite advice of tropical walrus. If your atomizer has fallen below 1 ohm, you might be able to unscrew the screws just a tiny bit to increase the resistance. Else, my friend with an istick just unscrews the atomizer from the istick just a tiny bit and it increases the resistance - this is with a nautilus, however. 

Also, your MVP will fire anything greater than 0.7 ohms. The istick fires anything equal to or greater than 1 ohm.  




 This. 

Or the insulator around the 510 pin is twisted and not preventing the positive current from running into the negative current, causing a short. 

[here's the piece were talking about.] (http://imgur.com/SWjxuq2) The pin that contacts the bottom of the atomizer, and the white ring insulator around it. Mine is very dried out and crapping out as well.  




 You'll most likely have to buy a new one (or figure out how to replace it). I thing the general idea around this subreddit is that batteries usually last a year or more until they start to decline. 




 Most of the time, I think, the vendors who give the product prototype to the reviewer usually make a lot of the changes in the prototype that the reviewer recommends, so the final product has a good chance of not having a cheap rattling button. 




 WHY does the .gif just stop? Who thinks that it is acceptable for me to see only the beginning of a slow motion balloon pop?  




 I found it in the video in the article op linked to. The clip in the .gif was before the video this guy linked to. Idk why he posted this version of the video here.  




 I think I missed the part of that video where the .gif comes from.  




 I would learn to overcome my fear of water brought on by the drowning of my father by sneaking into a large sailboat and sailing into the open ocean, where I'm met with a horrible sadistic storm that is ever increasing in intensity. As a response I tie myself to the ship and scream at the sky, accepting my death, until the storm eventually passes, I dry off, and suddenly crash my boat into the edge of the world as I know it. The head of my boat cracks through a wall painted to look like a skyline, and I immediately notice a set of painted stairs leading up the painted wall. As the set of stairs leads me to a door which reads "exit", I meet my real father who lives in the moon, and offers me a life encompassing ultimatum: Either I stay with him and continue to live in a world where everyone is watching me, or I venture into the open world. In response to his ultimatum, I open the door reading "exit", after saying

"Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!" 




 Seems to me like a very great way to capture personal information. You have one large outdoor WiFi network with very heavy traffic and no access restrictions. All it takes is some sniffing of that traffic to learn an awful lot about the people connected.

 so he stole thousands of dollars from his friend's wallet and fled on foot, then by stolen car, then on foot again once the friend alerted the police.

So he wasn't actually being chased by the police. He was just a wanted man who had committed a crime and went to pet kitties before he knew cops were after him.

 What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, kiddo.

 Got into my account. I don't know if it was a matter of the services being back online or what I did, but I'll share how I got into the account just in case it's a solution.

Started up CoD Advanced Warfare signed into a different account on the Xbox. Notification said Press whatever button (Select on the 360) to switch profiles. Did so. Put in password. Viola.  




 Wtf. [Is China raping us right now?](http://imgur.com/Mwj0N7w) 




 Question.

I'm trying to play single player via Xbox One, however my account requires a password in order to sign in. On the 360 you could just unplug the ethernet cable to sign in without a password. Is there an equivalent on the Xbox One? 




 You too!  




 I didn't. It was only an issue with one bottle and I didn't see fit to complain about it. Thank you, though!  




 I really loved this community when I first joined around 10 months ago. 




 30+mg? That sounds like flavor hell - nicotine really dulls down flavor.

Have you considered that having a higher power device allows you to drop nicotine levels because you're producing more vapor in each hit? 




 Great company with nice customer service in my opinion.

My last order was from them on 10/2/14. I ordered GWAR Bloodbath and a refill on Hawk Sauce. The Hawk Sauce I got was pretty different than usual   bad - it tasted like 50%Hawk Sauce and 50%Thug Juice. The Bloodbath was absolutely incredible, though.

 Sounds like me

Except the events were all true, and I'm a man. I had like the worst luck in the world getting to work, cars constantly breaking down no matter which one I drove,  my favorite dog passing away, landed in the hospital for breakdowns, storming out because I hated my job, etc. 

Girl most likely had a severe anxiety disorder  




 Thank you so very much!! Your words are very motivating and helpful! Thank you so much for commenting. I will remember that I can stop and relax every once in a while  :) 

Also, congratulations on your trip!  




 There's a fine line between the amount of long distance driving that calms my nerves, and the amount that has me horribly on edge. 

Driving long distance is horribly anxiety provoking for me, and I've been dreading this trip for the past month or so now. 

I have this irrational fear of my own fear, that I'll panic, lose contact with reality, lock up in traffic and crash, and crashing somewhere completely unknown frightens me.

 These last couple of months I've actually experienced what I'm telling myself is a new symptom of anxiety - having trouble breathing. I've experienced a whole bucket of symptoms, but never this common one. These last few days (it's horrible right now), I've been having to yawn or try to inhale as deeply as possible to scoop a deep breath out of myself, because I feel as if there is something in my upper chest/bronchi preventing me from taking a deep breath. This adds to my fear, because I of course have that part of my brain which is convinced it's always cancer, and I'm worried about suddenly not being able to breath halfway through my trip. 

I also have the worst of luck with cars, and I'm also naturally scared of breaking down somewhere and spending Christmas somewhere halfway between my starting point and destination. 

Thank you for reading -  any words of encouragement are greatly appreciated! I've struggled for some years and seen treatment both from a hospital environment and one on one therapy, however reminders and support will be much appreciated.
