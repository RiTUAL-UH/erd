Woah thats hard, well probably one of those:  
First one would be TI4 cuz that was first time i started really betting alot  
And second probably my first arcana, well i lost it in like two days^damnyouempire , but the feeling was amazing.   
Good luck all and happy betting !    
EDIT: Come at me downvote boy, the day we may fear you may come, but it wont be today!
 




 Hunter X Hunter ?   
Gon dying in episode 3?
well, this is not your typical shounen now ...  
Guys we gotta keep this thing running for just another 145 episode! 




 Welp, if just this thread came a half year earlier...  
edit: and it wasnt the ultimate game cuz of nyx carpace on the enemy team QQ 




 * Meepo - Earthbind
* Tinker - Heet-seeking missiles
* Tinker has refreshable disable that can catch multiple people and Meepo can shoot 2 rockets 4 times and the best thing is - 
* Aghanim
5 Meepoes - 4 rocket each one, I once managed to pick that in Ability draft, its really funny (at least when you are playin it :)). 




 Yeah, Soul Eater would deserve it really hard.
