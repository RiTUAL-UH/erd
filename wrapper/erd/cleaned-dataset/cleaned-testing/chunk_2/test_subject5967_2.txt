 I just noticed that Waino is starting for the Cardinals today. That's HUGE!  




 Also meaning Volquez would pitch a potential 163rd game against St. Louis if it's needed.  




 I parlayed ATL with PIT. 




 I've been a fan of the sport for a while, but I never had a club team that I felt attached to, which kept me from really getting into it. Republic FC Is my team now. Looking forward to many more great seasons ahead (hopefully in MLS).  




 Sad news everyone. Someone broke into the LA Dodgers trophy case last night. The thieves were last seen fleeing the stadium carrying a blue carpet.  




 A Dodgers fan doesn't understand what "World Series" means. Sounds about right.  









 Can we get a gif of Amy G getting sprayed in the face? I, uh, need it...for stuff.  




 You mean you almost ji22ed.  




 **St. Louis Cardinals ML** vs Arizona Diamondbacks 


St. Louis is clinging to a one game lead in the division going into the final series of the season, so they still have a lot to play for. Arizona has all but given up. Michael Wacha is pitching for the Cardinals and I think he'll have a good game.  




 We're on fire right now. Yesterday's potd, Metallurg Magnitogorsk -1.5, hit, which makes three correct picks in a row. Let's keep it going! 




RULES 

 No picks that are favorite by more than -200 


 No parlay or teaser bets, single bets only, prop bets are fine 


 Please include what sport you are talking about in your pick 


 Pick with most points at the end of voting is our pick of the day  




 I've been a Giants fan for 15 years, but Derek Jeter has been a constant in baseball for as long as I can remember. This is kind of like saying goodbye to a part of my childhood.  




 Trying to stay optimistic here:


1. We're still in great position to win the wild card.


2. The goal of the game is to win the World Series, not the division. We're still up 2-0 on the Dodgers there.  




 Kershaw looks like Sunshine from Remember the Titans.  




 Andrew Susac is the go ahead run...the next time through the order.  




 His arm has been thrown out for 2 years.  




 The joke is on you. You can't clinch if the game never ends.  




 Bochy might as well ask if any Giants fans in the crowd can throw strikes.  




 I'm assuming if you have $749 to spend on Candlestick seats, you also have a man cave to put them.  




 I should win a Cy Young... 




 What is Uribe's walk up song? It's catchy. 




 I once bought a growler of IPA from Stone. The woman working there said I should drink it within 48 hours of opening it. I decided to drink all 74 ounces in one night. Big mistake.  




 You have to finish your 6 pack by tomorrow. You can't have a San Diego beer in the fridge during a Padres series.  




 This really has been a great season for the rivalry. There's a perfect combination of fear, respect and hatred for each team.  




 [How Arias feels in the dugout right now]( http://i.imgur.com/3leLBzY.gif) 




 Slightly above the mean^for ^^a ^^^white ^^^^guy 




 I'm guessing we want the lefty-righty matchup with Kershaw against Arias.  




 I'm betting on a lot of baseball games on Thursday, it's hard to pick just one potd. I'll go with the **Giants/Padres under 6.5**. The Giants have not been hitting the ball well lately and the Padres haven't hit the ball well all year. On top of that, Andrew Cashner is pitching for San Diego. He shut down SF last week. Yusmeiro Petit has been one of the most consistent pitchers for the Giants over the last month and a half. 


My other picks for the day are **DET ML**, **MIL ML**, **WAS ML** and, **TB/BOS over 8.5**. 




 We have a two day win streak going as yesterday's potd, the Angels ML, hit. Let's go for three!  




 It got scary in the late innings, but the Angels hang on. Good call on this one.  




 That's what happens when you meet girls at Wagner-fest.  




 If he goes 3, then Lincecum will come in, which probably means another run or two.  




 In the last week, the only two Giants hitters who have shown any consistency are Gregor Blanco and Joe Panik. Posey, Sandoval, Pence, Belt, Crawford and Perez look lost. 


Edit: I considered the over 6. Hudson's last start against LA he didn't retire a batter in the second inning. He looked bad against the Padres last time out too. The problem I have with the over 6 is that he's going to be on a short leash. He won't be in the game long enough to allow 6 runs. On top of that, Kershaw is pitching for LA.



Edit: Decided to parlay Dodgers ML and over 6.   




 I like the value of the **Chicago White Sox** ML. Chris Sale is pitching against Verlander. I think the Sox at +108 has good potential.  




 Hudson's been getting rocked for a month now. This is a safe bet, but my book has LA at -250 right now, so the pay out isn't enough for me, a Giants fan, to bet against my own team.  




 For the Giants, that's been the case for close to two weeks. Even when Bum hit his homerun, the dugout wasn't nearly as excited as they should have been.  




 This is a frustrating team to watch right now. There's no energy.  




 Yes, but we can't afford to have him hit like this while he figures it out. These games are too important.  




 Right now we have offensive black holes at 1st base and left field. We'll have to figure that out by next week.  




 0-2 count in a one run ballgame against your biggest rival? Time for the wave! 




 I've honestly seen nothing but respect for Vin in r/sfgiants.   




 I honestly believe that Curt Schilling only has a job with ESPN because they feel bad that he went broke and then got cancer.  




 [We know how good he is ;-)](http://mlb.mlb.com/images/10252010/15826076/250x350_Uribe.jpg) 




 Maybe the most satisfying home run of the year.  




 Little do you know, there are world series trophies in that garbage can.  




 I thought I saw him pull up limp as he hit first too.  




 Puig got hit in the first. Words were exchanged, benches were warned.  




 Hopping on the bandwagon to lose in the first round once every 3 years?  




 Does anyone know for sure if the benches were warned after that HBP?  




 Puig knows he couldn't take Bum. It would be like a kid getting beat up by his dad.  




 Am I crazy or does Carl Crawford get an usual number of rest days? Is there a reason for that? He's on fire this month, but it seems like he's out of the lineup for half of the Dodgers game I've watched recently.  




 The reason I keep coming to this subreddit is because there's always a pick of the day that is two teams I've never heard of, in a sport I don't watch, in a league I've never heard of. I love putting a bet on Japanese level II women's soccer and waking up to some money. Warms my heart.  




 We got back on track on Tuesday with the Kansas City Royals ML. They won 7-1 Let's extend the streak to two.  




 My 5 team parlay was in tact going into the CAR/PIT game last Sunday. I thought the Panthers were a sure thing, but they totally blew it for me.  




 I'm on board with this as well. Good pick.  




 Me too. And that thought made me sick. I think what's so great about the rivalry right now is that there's a mutual fear of each other's team.  




 Off the top of my head, I can't remember a more exciting game. LA has so many guys with power, I was certain one of them would hit a walk off homer. That was pure torture for 4+ hours, but I loved every second of it.  




 He couldn't have picked the ball up and placed it in Butera's glove any better. Incredible!  




 It's a good thing they won, because I don't think I could have handled a loss. See you all tomorrow night, boys and girls.  




 Auburn checking in. He went to Jesuit.  




 Susac was held at third, but Blanco didn't notice and went for the triple. When he finally saw that third wasn't open he was in a pickle. When the Dodgers tried to get him, Susac ran home.  




 Crawford channeling his inner Chris Dominguez with that throw.  




 Puig could not have walked the ball to home plate and placed it in Butera's glove in a better position than that throw. Amazing.  




 Is there any doubt that this is the best rivalry in baseball right now? Yankees/Red Sox hasn't been exciting for a few years.  




 This is the rivalry at its best. I love it, ^but ^^I ^^^also ^^^^hate ^^^^^it 




 The Giants have 9 hits and the Dodgers have 3 errors. This game is being handed to us. We just need to take it.  




 You didn't think anyone would know who the greatest of all time is?  




 #RedMamba  




 This is the Giants/Dodgers rivalry at its best. I love it^but ^^I ^^^also ^^^^hate ^^^^^it 




 If he had held Belt there, we would have been freaking out on him too. Literally the only way Belt is out at home is if Puig's throw is perfect, and it was.  




 I don't see a better option at 3rd unfortunately.  




 Too much butter, not enough finger.  




 I like the hustle. 




 Look at those empty seats behind home plate. Disgraceful!  




 Free baseball!!! 




 Instructions for Dodgers fans.  




 Good morning ^good ^afternoon ^^good ^^night 




 We liked him when his schtick was new and exciting, but I think most of us were tired of defending him by the time he left.  




 The only thing bigger than Brian Wilson's ego is his era.  




 This pitcher looks like he's about to join ISIS. 




 Last week of the season, Bottom 7, one on against your most hated rival. Better do the wave!  




 There's a free version, but you only get a limited number of skips per hour and you can't select which song you listen to, only the artist/album.


I pay $10/month to be able to listen any song at any time. You can get a free trial to see if it's worth it. I even got a 3 month's for the price of one deal when I signed up.  




 Good morning^goodafternoon^^good night


Edit: Fuck it! I don't know how to format.  




 Your mom took her shirt off?!! 




 Your rock hard Peavy is giving me a Peavy.  




 What should we do? Cry about it?  




 That's frustrating as fuck when that happens in Road to the Show. It's got to be even worse in real life.  




 I think any intentional HBPs are dumb. It's hard to say definitively that that was intentional though.  




 Matt Kemp was distracted wondering how Rihanna dumped him for Chris Brown.  




 Kemp called it. That one's on Puig.  




 I'm assuming there's bad traffic getting to the game.  




 Jake Peavy looks like he could have been an Irish bare knuckle boxer a hundred years ago.  




 I like the value of the **KC Royals** ML. They're the underdog and they're playing a team with a nearly identical record, but they have a better pitcher pitching. I think they're worth a bet. 



I also like the **under 6** on the **Dodgers/Giants** game. Bumgarner has absolute ownage against the Dodgers in his career. Greinke is pitching for LA and the Giants haven't been hitting lately. It might also be worth putting a unit on the Giants ML. They're underdogs, but I think there's good value there.  




 What happened to the user who usually posts the potd thread?  




 I think this is the safest MLB bet of the day. St. Louis is a better team and they have their best pitcher pitching. 




 I got tired of my usual workout music. I had always been a fan of certain songs on The Dark Knight Rises score because they made made feel like Batman training in a prison cell, so I set out to find equally motivating music. I took mainly from the work of Hans Zimmer (TDKR, TDK, Pirates of the Caribbean, Gladiator, Man of Steel, Inception, The Lone Ranger), but there are a few other artists in the playlist. It's mostly upbeat, but has the occasional slower pace, which makes the eventual build up even more epic and motivational. 



Give it a listen and let me know what you think. Tell me if there's a song I should add to or remove from the list. I'm by no means knowledgeable about this kind of music, so I'm sure there are plenty of awesome songs that I don't know about. 



[Here is the finished product]( http://open.spotify.com/user/swolebuddha/playlist/1gQZicqZROQnFYsbQO0Zp7). I hope it serves you well. 




 It's kind of late and no one has posted a potd thread yet, so I'll do it.  




 As you can see, my picks thus far are 12-1-1 against the spread


Wow, this guy *is* pretty good.



 That puts me at a total of 17-12-1 so far this year




Oh... 




 Is this the only nationally televised morning game? Usually Fox will have one, but they don't.  




 I made a parlay bet that the Angels would win and more than 7 1/2 runs would be scored. Help a Giants fan out, will you halos? 


Edit: Atta team.  




 I broke my own rule of not betting on games I'm emotionally invested in. I took the under 6 on this game. I have that much faith in Petit. ^And ^that ^little ^faith ^in ^our ^offense 




 I can't find an email about it and I can't redeem it on the app. Has anyone besides OP been successful? Maybe it has to be done on a pc. 


Edit: Can't find it on my computer either. Maybe it expired?  




 I'm down to go out in Roseville most nights. We should meet up.  




 Posey has 15 RBIs in his last 15 games. That's second best in the league for the month of September.  




 If Timmy pitches well tonight, I say we start him for Hudson next week in LA.  




 His smile is so smug. You can tell he's proud of his idea.  




 [Broken bat Kuiper]( http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2013/0904/mlb_kuiper_kh_200.jpg) 




 Pretty smokey in the mornings in Auburn too.
