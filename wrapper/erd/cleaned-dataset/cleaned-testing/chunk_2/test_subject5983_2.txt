 I think it's great. The laughs all come from how horrible of a person Merchant is and a whole lot of horribly awkward / cringeworthy situations. Give it a shot. 














 The gif of Jennifer Lawrence making out with Amy Adams WILL make the front page.

 No they won't. Facebook has basically accepted this especially since they started to compete with it through Instagram direct.  




 I have a 1 TB WD MyPassport Ultra formatted with 1 partition to Fat-32. It is plugged into the PS3 via USB with the folders Music, Photo, Video, Game, and PS3. Whenever I use backup utility it says "Connect storage media at the save destination". I have looked all over and can not find out what I have done wrong. Help? 




 Nice catch. 




 Any Wes Anderson, Fight Club's Ikea listings, or the name pop-ins from Snatch. 









 Chic Fil A fountain drinks are the shit.

 We didn't ask for your goddamn opinion, guy.

 Favorite movie? And if you could pick anyone to play you in a movie, who would you pick? 




 I'm confused. What is this? 




 That's not a real subreddit, silly.  




 This is really cool. If you keep this up, a yearly breakdown would be top. 









 Reminds me of [Will Grello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-m7mBSw-5k).

 Premature commenting. Thought I already deleted it. 




 They're the same age? Holy shit I thought Matt Damon was much younger than Mark Wahlberg. 




 My old American Lit teacher is a dead ringer for Hugh Laurie. I can't find a picture, but he did have an autographed photo of Hugh that was signed "to my twin". 




 Ahhhh shit yeah. Thanks. 




 What is this? 




 Well I'll be damned. My mistake. 




 He didn't say it was shit he just said it was really slow.  




 "Life isn't about being liked, it's about being effective"

What a cunt. 




 Geez, stop being so OCD and let the man continue to think he's OCD.  









 That was the only thing I got for my 9th birthday. Kept me busier than any present has since.  









 Nice try, Bieber 




 If they work quick they could get Idris Elba.  




 Of course Wil.I.Am is somehow involved. 




 Woah...when did this guy de-fat himself?

 On the other hand, I met Macklemore in the NBA store in NYC two or three days ago. Dude seemed really sad and didn't say a word as I asked for a picture. Made me feel like a bit of an asshole for asking although I've been a huge fan for a while. He was all alone and looked tired as shit.  




 Please tell me that was some kind of essay you had already written and not just a reddit comment.  




 Goddammit.  




 I don't think this will happen, but it's not always necessarily about bringing something new. Especially after finding so much success with Craig, I doubt they'd want to bring in someone completely different after his run is over.

 I remember this guy. He used to be full of cringe and bullshit. He would make videos where he drank two bottles of vodka with no hands in 45 seconds and crazy stuff like that, and then he would upload videos saying he would never upload a drinking video again, swearing on his mother's grave. Then he would upload two more and delete the last video. Also he ran for that "KingOfTheWeb" thing where the winner would get some cash prize, and Shoenice had a smear campaign where he would trash the people who were beating him (usually teenaged make-up gurus), and he would encourage his fans to cheat and make multiple accounts to vote for him, and then he freaked out when he was banned. I used to message back and forth arguing with him and he would constantly lie and brag about his YouTube money and how he was so much better than me because he was making his living eat glue on street corners for YouTube. It was pretty funny, and pretty sad. 









 That's badass. 




 Thanks. I got that. I mean note wise. 




 Fuck.

 Good movie.  




 Well shit.  




 Cool. If you ever need any more from any episodes I take a lot and have em all on my laptop. Just let me know. 




 How are these?

 I have no idea how old your boss is. 




 Wow he sure is good at screaming. 




 That was fantastic. Is Frank Day next?

 Holy shit. That's amazing. 




 No no I meant that you're teeth didn't appear white enough. The hair thing was just the minor part. 




 I fixed your "problem" for you.
