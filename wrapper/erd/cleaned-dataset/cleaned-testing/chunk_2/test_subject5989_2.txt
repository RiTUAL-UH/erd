 That's awesome, good work. I'd love to be a co-admin if I could find people looking for one, or at least have unlimited resources.. Would like to be able to build and improve on my design skills. 




 wow nice, this was before the stability stuff existed? Don't see how the tree stuff is possible. Also were you an Admin? tons of mats for those id assume.
