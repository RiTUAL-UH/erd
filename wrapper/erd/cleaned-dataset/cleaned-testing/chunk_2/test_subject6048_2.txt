 I just finished "Stranger in a Strange Land". A popular science fiction novel from the sixties, this delves into a deep examination of what we value in a western culture, particularly in regards to religion and sexuality.

More importantly, this book is funny. There's humor enriched in all the pages, and makes reading it a genuinely enjoyable experience. 

After reading intense and complicated sci-fi, I chose this as a light option. I ended doing a serious examination about what my values are how people view things in western (especially American) society.

I'd suggest looking up some of the tremendous quotes from this book on a site like Goodreads, see if you find any intriguing, you may want to pick it up. 









 It took several moments for her words to register in his brain. The waves of adrenaline and euphoria hadn't finished passing over him. The knife...had he plunged it into a handbag my mistake? Certainly he felt the comforting sensation of cool metal sliding into that bloated sack of blood dangling off of her skeleton. Malcolm made efforts to maintain his natural steadfast, intimidating state, yet his face could not untwist itself from puzzlement.

"Take out the blade", she said softly. A whisper, drowned out by the wind as if not a  note had escaped her lips yet words he heard clear as crystal in his head. Her grey eyes piercing so deep into his own, it felt as if she was gazing at the entirety of his life.

Malcolm strained and sweated as he found himself gripping the chaffed, ribbed bronze hilt. Hot. More than hot, scalding. His eyes bulged with terror as he found himself tightly grasping and removing the scalding metal. Tendrils of smoke appeared above his hand. Nothing to hear but his heartbeat. Loud and hot. Nothing to see but her eyes. Grey and sharp. Drips of melted skin began to smack the pavement below.

The knife left her belly, a gaping wound left smoking, staring up at him.

"Now balance the scale", she commanded.

There was an instant, an instant after those words were uttered that he knew he was about to perish. An instant of complete terror, and a juvenile absence of any form of understanding. When that moment had passed the blade leapt from his fingertips and dug itself deep into his throat. Indeed, choosing this woman in particular to mug was a poor evaluation.

The woman stared down at the corpse, and drank in a deep gulp of icy, bloodfilled air, "I can't help but enjoy these moments", she mused. A faint grin crept along the side of her mouth. She decided to continue her stroll throughout the park. 




 Wouldn't offering to work for free be the most efficient way to get practice early on? Especially if OP is doing this as a hobby rather than trying to get by, he/she can probably afford a few free contracts. Doing VO's for student films doesn't seems like nearly as valuable a learning experience as actual professional work, and if it's as competitive as you say it is, quality and experienced professionals should have little trouble getting jobs over people like him.  




 Twixt was honestly the worst movie I've ever seen.  




 The scene I'm referring to is where Mcnulty is sitting in his car drunk. He's on top of a hill, some kind of commotion happens at the bottom of it and causes a car alarm to go off. He gets out, shows his badge, and slips and slides down the hill because he's so hammered. Then proceeds to start laughing when he sees mud on his badge and the obvious metaphor.

Anyway, there's a oldie playing in his car, sung by a woman- can't for the life of me think of the song. Can't remember the episode or season or I'd try to find it myself. Hope I gave a decent description and one of you can help me out. Thanks all.
 




 This is something minor, that occurs anywhere from several times a week to several times a month. I'm 25 and take care of my body. I eat healthy and exercise ~5 times a week. Would an EKG be sufficient? My concern is that I'll have an EKG, everything will come up normal, but there is an underlying problem it doesnt pick up.

Possibly I'm overthinking this and am paranoid?

Thanks. 




 ...or any other crowd-funding method for that matter.

I always end up reading about these games when they initially show up, and are naturally surrounded by a lot of hype. "This is going to be a tremendous RPG just like it was in the glory days!".

Have any of you played these games? Been involved with development? Read about anything interesting as in do they live up to what they promise?

I started reading up on this one, which got be thinking on the subject: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/482445197/unsung-story-tale-of-the-guardians

Love to know what you all think. 




 Learning about camera angles, lighting, literally any kind of discussion in regards to film making. 




 Thanks for taking the time to give such a thoughtful response! 

Going to some small classes is a great idea. I've almost exclusively done yoga by myself, and having an instructor critique me on my form would be quite valuable. I like the idea of exploring different poses and flows. I think I'm going to start with some sun salutations, and explore different variations of warrior, maybe triangle. 

Cheers. 




 Having Griffin run out in wide receiver routes is one of the most irresponsible moves he could have made. 




 I've been doing Yoga on and off for several years now. Learned mainly from this book: http://www.amazon.com/Moving-Toward-Balance-Weeks-Rodney/dp/0875969216/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top

I want to do a quick routine every morning that takes roughly 10-15 minutes. Was hoping someone could point me in the right direction, or possibly just give me a routine that they enjoy doing themselves.

Happy Friday! 




 Hopefully it lacks all form of similarity to the last sequel they made. 




 Inspiring images. When the day to day office grind is draining at my psyche, it's posts like this that remind me that we live in such a beautiful and adventurous world. Thanks for sharing these, brotha. 




 No one wants to say it, but Jaime isn't gonna make it. He's my favorite....but we all know what's coming. 




 Wow this is exactly what I needed. Thanks so much and happy new year! 




 I'm at work, only access to reddit is through my phone AND the content is NSFW, otherwise I'd give this a shot myself.

Here's the link(NSFW): http://m.pornhub.com/video/show/title/giselle_cole_interracial/vkey/617461911

Ideally this would have her face and ass in the gif. Any suggestions on what website/subreddit I could submit this request to? If anyone reading this thinks they could throw something together today I'd be willing to barter and do some kind if favor in return.

Thanks!

Would prefer to have her face in the shot, basically any moment from this video is fine though. First time using this sub hope I followed the rules, any way I can return the favor please let me know- would truly appreciate some help on this one.

Thanks!

EDIT: Words 




 Why don't you just dump her? 




 I say this with the New York Giants in mind, but obviously this question could be in the context of many teams this year. 

It's quite a popular opinion that Kevin Gilbride, their Offensive coordinator, needed to leave a long time ago. Considering he was together with big TC back in Jacksonville, my thinking is that Coughlin will stay loyal to his man. What do you guys think will happen? 




 How was the sex? 




 I wouldn't exactly describe Friday's tropical storm/both headliners cancelling as an amazing experience.

That being said I'll be there next year. 




 How long you been drawing for? This is so impressive!

Any website you'd recommend for a total noob trying to learn? 




 There's going to be four of us total at my friends house and was looking for any suggestions your guys may have. Here are some ideas we're tossing around right now:

1) dressing up in old Halloween costumes

2) laying out paper/crayons/markers and partake in some arts n crafts

3) playing music throughout surround sound (not sure what to choose, possibly a medley of nature sounds, classical, funk, jazz)

Love to know what you all think! Thanks! 




 Think about how difficult it is to scout a player. You have to look at someone when they're 17 and determine who they will be when they're 26. Try doing that in any profession or school of thought. All of these guys have great athletic talent- imagine the enormous process of evaluating all the other factors that will affect these people not just as football players but as men. If anything they're going to be wrong MOST of the time. Every pick is a gamble. Something you just have to accept. 




 2011 week 14 against the Giants. At this point, both teams were in the hunt for the division. Basically the Giants were down 12 points with time expiring. They score their first touchdown. In order to have a shot at scoring their second, they need the Cowboys to go 3 and out on the next drive in order to leave enough time on the clock. On 3rd and long, Romo had a completely wide open Miles Austin who is just running with his hands up to Romo's right, around 15 yards down the field. Romo then lobs it about another 15 yards ahead of him into dead space. Giants go on to win the game. 

Personally I think Romo is a great QB that gets way too much shit- simply a product of being on the Cowboys. He dug himself into a hole early in his career by embracing his celebrity status, but I think at this point he's moved past it. This is a guy that made a 4th quarter comeback with a punctured lung and several broken ribs- someone like that will always have my respect.

EDIT: Wording 




 When he spends his playoff BYE week in Mexico with Jessica Simpson. 




 The winners in this were the attorneys on both sides collecting fees for 8 months. 




 "This just in: the Washington Redskins have traded their 2015 and 2016 first round picks to the Green Bay Packers in a trade for Matt Flynn." 




 Stop being a pussy and get a divorce. 




 Bill Bryson has put out a lot of great work- I'd recommend browsing his other books online and seeing if anything catches your interest. This is assuming it's the style/voice he uses that made you like it so much.

As far as more on the topics of that book? Definitely A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking and Cosmos by Carl Sagan.

'A Short History of Nearly Everything' is a fantastic read, glad you enjoyed it. I read it a while back, and about a week ago bought the Audible version of it. Every time I hit the gym now I have this great british voice babbling to me about atoms and stardust. Highly recommend this for anyone looking for a great audio book, you can pick it up at any point in the narrative and immediately find things interesting. 




 He's 100% starting, he just might not be that effective. 




 I'd definitely roll with Amendola in that one. 




 Standard Scoring. Please pick two: Jordan Cameron vs Bears, Charles Clay vs Patriots, Danny Amendola vs Dolphins, Chris Ivory vs Panthers. 




 Cocaine's a helluva drug. 




 Just keep in mind that he has a tweaked ankle and doesn't have his quarterback. He's a risky plau even with the start. 




 S Jax and Vereen are definitely the best out of that group. 




 TOUGH- you've got to go Alfred here. That's the smart move. But the ballsy move that might make you win a playoff game? That's starting Spiller. I'd roll high risk/high reward on this one. 




 Out of that group, Forte is both the better back AND part of the better offense. He's your man. My second choice would be Vereen, however that Patriots offense is simply too unpredictable to trust in a playoff game. 




 Standard Scoring, choose 1: DeAngelo Williams, Donald Brown, and Chris Ivory.
 




 Standard Scoring, choose 1: DeAngelo Williams, Donald Brown, and Chris Ivory.

I'd love roll with Ivory, but I'm terrified of that matchup against Carolina. As of now I have Donal Brown starting, but I'm convinced he's going to put up another dud. Thoughts?

Thanks for doing this, you're helping out a lot of peeps and dish out some great insight. 




 Very impressive. Congrats, man. 




 Are you really just going to ignore what each of those receivers has done the past few weeks?

As for Miami having good CB's- look what Pittsburg did to them last week.
 




 Call the police on her. She's guilty of almost every count of child abuse out there. 




 Gahhhdamn that's impressive. 




 I'm going to say Amendola. I think he's finally going to be as effective as was hoped in the preseason. Gronk out, and the defense honing in on Edelman and Vereen- I think this is his day. 

Or he get's tackled on the second play of the game and explodes into a cloud of dust.

What do you guys think? 




 Edelman by a mile. He's been outstanding the past three weeks, and with Gronk out he'll only get more opportunities.

Nelson is utterly useless without Rodgers. 




 There's many similarities between the two. You learn a TON about the samurai and the culture that surrounds them. If these subjects interest you- this must be read. Imagine all the information that would be stocked into a textbook on this subject, you learn all of that in a completely passive enjoyable way, since it is all done while partaking in this amazing adventure. Book is a tomb but don't be intimidated- you'll want it to last as long as possible. 




 Pierre Thomas. Keep a close eye on news following Ridley though, if he's due for a larger number of snaps I'd give it to him. 




 Cotchery 




 Tavon Austin. 




 Rainey without question. 




 If it's just 1? I'd go Garcon. They're likely going to be behind and throwing a lot that game into a soft defense.

If you need two out of that...I'd have to roll with Edelman. he's been outstanding the last few weeks, and with Gronk out he should only sap up more targets. 




 Standard Scoring please pick 2:

Charles Clay vs Patriots

Jordan Cameron vs Bears

Danny Amendola vs Dolphins

Cheers 




 Sales!

Just kidding. Something you could do part time is customer support. Now I know this goes against what you just said- you'd be interacting with strangers. But I think this would be a more comfortable environment for you, and more importantly would help you overcome your fear of interacting with people. 

EDIT: Spelling/Grammar 




 Growlanser has items you can purchase towards the end of the game that de-level your character but let them retain the same stats. Problem is there really isn't much end-game material, nothing challenging enough to beef up your guys for. 




 Try putting this in /r/writing. You may get a lot of downvotes here since this is obviously a work of fiction, but it was an interesting read so far.

EDIT: spacing 




 Does he have a steady job? If strapped for cash I can sort of understand it. 

Bottom line you married someone who is extremely immature for his age. I'd expect this from someone ten years younger than him. 




 /r/freelancewriters 




 A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole (American/Funny)

Shogun by James Clavell (Historical Fiction/Japan)

Dune by Frank Herbert (Sci-Fi)

Hyperion by Dan Simmons (Sci-Fi)

I'd give two of these. All some of my favorite reads that I think could appeal to anyone that enjoys reading. 




 You're going to get your brother in a great deal of trouble. 




 Came here to say basically the same thing- so frustrated at the moment.
