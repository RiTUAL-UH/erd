 Hm.. hard to pick just 1... I think that trader joes' dark chocolate peanut butter cups are darn delicious.  Their cookie butter dark chocolate bars are addicting too.  Then there's chocomize where you can add whatever.  I like their premade salty bar.  Kit kats are bomb, and so are almond snickers.  I'm hungry... can you tell? Hahahahah 




 Lol I can totally relate.  My dreams are always vivid so all of the cheating ones still make me mad.  Scumbag brain.. Hahahah 




 I'm not sure if that has anything to do with your child having autism... 




 That happened to my husband a week ago!  He was still upset for a few days after :D  I was kinda flattered that I was so slutty in his dream, since usually it's the other way around in my dreams. Lol 









 Please clean it after with alcohol or something.... pleaseeeeeee 




 It's the same opinion I have for straight parents... If you can afford to raise the child, aren't insane, loving, then go for it! 




 I have no idea how anyone can be against gays.  Look at how cute he is! 




 His left hand looks way bigger than his right? I have no idea...I was never good at those "find what's wrong with this picture" games :( 




 Henry Cavill.  We were at the Immortals premiere and I saw him take photos with female fans in the theater.  So I gathered up my courage, walked over, and asked if he would take a photo with me... Well he turned around, took a look at me, and said " oh they are going to start  the movie" then went back to chatting with the hot girls.  I guess my t-shirt, jeans, and glasses wasn't very cute :( *edited to remove typo 




 Omg I'm freaking out.  I love flight of the conchordsssssss. :D 




 He doesn't seem very impressed... 




 A whole new world! I get very into it when I sing that song. 




 I like the Lindsay Lohan one where she played Hermione after hitting puberty.  Hilarious!   




 You've met some terrible terrible cats.  You're really missing out!  




 I love thissssss!! Lol 




 But cardio is cardio lol.  And i'm sure his heart rate is crazy high. 




 I'm scared.. but.. I didn't like Firefly... :( 




 You would think that with skills like that he'd be super lean. 




 Omg!!!  My fear definitely started after movies started showing the impact from within the car.  The worst for me was from the movie Adaptation.  Did not see that coming.   




 It has to be Ginuwine's Pony http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJoQgixtR78 




 "I love to travel, go to nice restaurants, and shop.  I don't know why people don't spend money to buy nice clothes and accessories. " The girl lived in her in-law's converted garage with her husband. They spent all of their earnings on luxuries.  I wanted to strangle her. 




 Getting into a car accident.  I picture it in my head sometimes while I'm in a car.  Horrible :( 




 Exactly!  It's like a deep deep exfoliation session hahaha 




 He likes to lick my face... and just so happened to get my eye when I took the picture. 









 Aww I want to kiss those cheeks!!!  




 Thank you so much for your help.  Sucuri definitely found malware on my blog but when I went into my posts, I couldn't find any lines of text that seemed out of place.  I emailed my hosting to see if they could help but no reply yet. 




 Beautiful photograph!  We don't have an attatched garage so our dog stands outside of the restroom when I go in to use it ....  




 aw he loves it!  My whippet hates bananas.. lol 




 Hi guys, today is the 2nd time my wordpress blog has been redirecting to a porn website when you read it on a mobile device.  I've changed my admin password, I always update my plugins and wordpress versions.. and this still happened to me.  What else can I do?  Thank you so much!  Thank you for your help. 




 No problem!  Here's a list of bonfires in southern california http://www.beachcalifornia.com/beach-bonfires-california.html .  I love doing beach days though it might get crowded in July.  No bonfires but Venice Beach is always fun.  Other fun stuff would be hiking to the Griffith Observatory http://www.yelp.com/biz/griffith-observatory-hike-los-angeles or http://www.yelp.com/biz/runyon-canyon-park-los-angeles-2 if you want to catch some celebrities.  Tons of girly stuff to do here in LA.  I hope you gals have a great time :D 




 TV Anchors that just lose it or SNL cast members/guests that break character. 




 Hi!  Not sure what your exact budget is, but I would go to travelzoo or groupon and check out some of the deals they have for hotel or group activites.  Temecula (lots of wine tastings here) is only 90 minutes from LA so you can still party at a club on a day and checkout some orchards on another.  Another lower cost option would be hanging out at the beach for the day for a picnic/bbq and stay for a bonfire at night.  Cheap and fun!  Hope that helps :D 




 I really love Dog Haus!  It's affordable, delicious, and I love the relaxed vibe.  My favorite location is their Pasadena Biergarten one :D 




 Lol I am not a girl with a big butt but I remember being surprised at how much bounce I was getting.  The even more embarassing part was that there were people in front of me and I felt like a bowling ball.  Kind of like that chubby black kid in Hook. 




 Was touring a newly built 15 million dollar home while wearing a pair of booties over my shoes on a newly installed/waxed wooden spiral staircase.  My life flashed before my eyes as I started to bounce down the steps on my butt.  First thing I said when I stood up was "omg did I break the stairs?".  I did not want to pay to fix a staircase that was put into a home that expensive lol. 




 You were 2??? Ehhh I'm so old.. Lol 




 Watching Interview with a Vampire while lying on the floor leaning against the ottoman... while my dog is on the couch all tucked in with a blanket. 




 End of the Road = Junior High.  Basically anything Boyz II Men Makes me feel young again... 




 Mexican pizza from Taco Bell.  The only time it actually tastes delicious.
