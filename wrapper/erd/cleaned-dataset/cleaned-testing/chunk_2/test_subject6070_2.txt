 It depends, if it is a large order than yes, because I am responsible for making sure that every thing comes out properly, boxing it up, and getting the other stuff like silverware, to go drinks etc., but even on a large order 10% is considered the standard. On a small order (2 or less meals) no tip required but leaving a dollar or two is always appreciated.  




 I've lived with a few male roommates, for the most part they are a bit messier than the girls I lived with, but had less drama so fair trade in my book. Some girls are crazy as fuck. 




 When I was 13 I had a friend who was form Vietnam, she had been in the US since she was 6 months old so she spoke english fluently. Her parents however spoke very little English. One night we were at he house and these guys we went to school with were all having a sleep over a couple blocks away, we decided to sneak out of the house and go hang out with the boys, after a few hours we needed to get back to the house and the guys walked us home to make sure we got there alright. When we climbed back through the window her dad woke up and thought someone was breaking into the house he called 911, and then busted in her door with a shotgun. He saw me and his daughter fully dressed sitting on her bed and a group of boys running away from the house, the cops then showed up. My friends dad told them they could leave and it was a misunderstanding. He then called my mom and told her I  was a "bad girl" and she needed to pick me up. While we were waiting for my mom he gave lecture about how dangerous it was to sneak out and to spend time with boys who could rape us. He would lecture for a few minuets then my friend would translate his words. When my mom showed up it came across like he was trying to blame us sneaking out on me ( I am not sure if he was truly trying to blame me or if it was his limited vocabulary). My mom then blamed him for not keeping a better eye on us. My friend and I weren't allowed to hang out anymore after that. That was almost 15 years ago and we are still best friends today.  




 I love my job, it is the most challenging, and rewarding thing I have ever done. It pushes me to be a better person every day because I want to be better for my students every day. I  have kids tell me their darkest secrets and I am always happy to try and help them sort out what is going on in their life. I do enjoy my content area, but it pales in comparison to the students and how they touch my life. You are going into one of the most important professions in society, for some students you will be one of the only good role models they have, one of the only adults they trust, you will be able to push them to expand their mind, they will love you and because of that they will be willing to at least try to do the work. Do everything out of love, even when kids get in trouble, explain why the rules are important for everyone to follow so that the classroom is safe and that the punishments are their for the same reason . I very rarely yell, I find it is much more effective to talk to students in the hall way if we are having issues then to just jump to a detention. Often times kids still get the punishment but we have had the opportunity to talk about why they got it and how to change the behavior in the future . There is a ton of paper work , and there are law makers who come up with systems that make no since to educators , but fuck them. I love my job every day and I will do the paper work and deal with the shitty things because I am tankful to get to do my passion every day and have impact on the next generation. Best of luck to you.  




  He explained the similarities in his interview, he eventually became a manager and said it was very similar to managing a classroom , and that is why he was so successful at it. Just some things to consider before making the switch, pros the money is much better, their are certain perks that come with the job(company trips, nice dinners, and networking ), the down side its that every year is like your first year of teaching, my dad worked 70 hours a week most weeks. The company sets your sales goals and they always expect you to keep inflating sales even if the market is saturated. Another thing to consider is that in recent years drug companies have come under scrutiny and therefor aren't allowed to do a lot of the things that used to make the job fun ( bring doctor offices lunch, take doctors to see speakers , take nurses out to dinner ect) there is a lot less fluff than their used to be. My dad worked for the company for 20 years and has a nice retirement. My mom still works for a different drug company (she was also a former teacher) she said that now they like to see people with a science back ground, so if you teach any STEM classes I would say you have a good shot, also most drug reps would be happy to let you shadow them one day, to get a better idea of what it is like. My dad said that he missed teaching because of the human factor, a couple years before he retired, he started helping out with high school wrestling because he missed working with kids. hope this was helpful , best of luck to you  




 I was a bartender before I was a teacher, the best thing about bar tending is you can't take your work home with you. It took me about 3 years to get into a bar position that I really liked, (most busy bars want a few years of experience) but I made amazing friends had a ton of fun, and made damn near close to what I make as a teacher.  




 I think what set me apart is I have great resume and interview skills. I also dress very well, which seems trivial but getting hired is all about first impressions. One of my friends got hired because they had coached basket ball and the school needed some one to take over JV. 
I think it would be unlikely that a school would hire you before student teaching, and honestly you wouldn't want to teach before you student teach. Student teaching is really where you gain most of your skills like classroom management , non instructional routines, and how to handle your work load. 
Does your school offer certification before student teaching? 




 I have always had a theory that most great teachers burn out around 10 years, because teaching is a hammer of a profession and if you are giving it your all, then it isn't sustainable for most people. I admire you for recognizing that you need a change and not becoming one of those teachers who "don't teach" , or takes their anger out on their students. Both my parent were teachers and my dad left after 15 years and became a drug rep. Drug companies like teachers because they are good at learning information , and explaining it. So maybe give that a shot, best of luck to you .  




 I cater waiter a couple times a week , it is nice to have some extra cash and because I bar tended my way through school it is easy work. I go to the gym a lot, and I volunteer at the suicide hotline. Take some time and go visit family and friends that you haven't seen in a while, often times i am so busy during the year that I don't get to spend much quality time with the ones I love. Hope this helps! 




 I would suggest that if you haven't started your content area that you look into math, special ed, or science. These areas tend to have more job openings , I received a MAT is secondary social studies and was one of 3 teachers who got hired before the school year started. Most of my grad school friends are subbing or considering going to teach ESL in Asia. If I could do it over I would have gotten a degree in special education. 
To answer your second questions most MA programs have student teaching as the last course before you graduate. It is nearly impossible to get hired anywhere without student teaching, even if you have a certificate, most employers want to have an idea of what you are like in the classroom.  hope this is helpful feel free to message me any further questions. 




 I too had an awful experience with k2 I smoked some after a night of partying with friends ,at first I just felt high then really parinoid, then my thoughts felt completely splintered. I felt absolutely insane I was with friends and didn't want to freak anyone out so I went into the back room and laid in the fetal postion for hours my friends came to check on me I couldn't speak in complete sentences. I was very worried that I had done permanent damage to my brian after 8 hours of feeling like this I started to feel better but it took about a week before I felt normal. K2 is horrible and should never be compared to actual weed. 




 Freakenomics suggested that part of the reason that crime decreased was because abortions became easily available after Roe V Wade, and because their we less unprepared parents, and everything that can go a long with that (poverty, less education, less resources ) their were less criminals produced. They used statistical information form the US and Romania to show the link between the availability of abortions and crime rates over the next 30 years.  









 Rule number 1 of being a vegan is bring your own food and bring enough for others to eat. It sucks to get picked on for wanting to live a compassionate life, the way I have handled it is by killing people with kindness. I never expect there to be anything for me to eat unless I am at my house. I keep dried fruit and nuts in my bag at all times just in case I get in a predicament. I very rarely mention to people that I am vegan. If people do know that I am a vegan and ask me a bunch of questions about what I eat I offer to bring them a vegan lunch the next day  a lot of people enjoy it and then asking for vegan options becomes more of a group thing and not just you "being a demanding vegan". I remind my self that becoming a vegan didn't happen overnight for me ,so I can't expect people to understand it overnight. 

TL;DR make some allies in the office , make them see veganism differently through your actions.

 I used to work at 24 hour suicide hotline, you would be amazed at the number of calls I would get on an over night where guys were trying to get me to have phone sex or get me to say things that they could jerk it to.  




 Bald men are sexy, from my experience they have a good since of humor, and are fantastic in bed. Own your bald head, if you wear a hat make sure to take it off at some point when you meet someone for the first time so that they aren't shocked or don't recognize you next time. 




 I too teach history, you are entitled to your opinion. But it really bothers me when teachers complain about their salary. You knew what you were signing up for and there is more than one way to get paid.  




 You must not be a history teacher. 




 I would hypothesize that life expectancy stayed about the same. Slave owners saw their slaves as investments and they wanted to keep them a live as long as possible. After the war the Union controlled much of the government regulation for the first few years, so lynching of freed slaves wasn't very prevalent. Most freed slaves had little education or skills, many became share croppers which is very similar to slavery.  




 How long some one had left to live , but they couldn't see it and no body could tell them , but every one would know. 




 When students slack off all quarter and then try and make up 9 weeks worth of work in 2 days , and bullys fuck that shit . I am pretty laid back but if you are rude to me or mean to another student I will bring the reckoning down on you. 




 It depends on if the gold bricks were redistributed from the gold that already exists or if new gold was some how made. If it was just redistributed and still held its value then it would close some of the income gap. If it was created  then it would become devalued.most likey used for electronics. It would not effect fiat currency , because this money is separate from the value of gold, and the  government it what determines the value. It would proably have a negative effect on any gold based currency 




 I have a bachelors  and a masters degree both from regular university to get an addional certification in my field I took two online classes , they were no were near as difficult or engaging as the classes I took in a real classroom. I don't feel like I learned as much from them, based on my experience if  someone had a degree that was done completely online , I wouldn't consider their education to be as thorough.
 




 I would say it is not a good first date question, see how it goes maybe you'll hit it off maybe you wont, and if you don't no need to ask. i think most women who aren't trans would be somewhat offended if they were asked , and then you become one of those "worst date ever stories" 




 What are you contributing, to the causes that you hold dearest to your heart? Made me change my career. 




 that is an good point 




 One of my best friends is transgendered, and she feels like it is dehumanizing to ask if she has had surgery to become a woman. She said if you wouldn't ask a non transgendered person about their genitals why is it acceptable to ask her. I also know that she is very open with everyone she dates that she wasn't born in a woman's body. I would get to know the woman if you like her keep dating her and she will probably tell you about it when she is ready. If she isn't trans then you'll most likely find out when the relationship becomes physical. If you aren't cool with dating someone who is trans then maybe you could bring it up in conversation with her and gage her reaction with out straight up asking her. But if you are cool with dating someone who is trans, then just keep dating if things are going well and like most secrets she will tell you when she feels she can trust you. To me it sounds like you find her attractive and like her enough to ask her out again so why are you letting your friend mess with your head ? 




 what artist would you like to see cover one of your songs?  




 I was a bartender for a long time , so I've hear pretty much everything but a guy came in one night kept ordering whiskey on the rocks, and then he ordered a red headed slut, I brought him the shot. then he said "I wasn't talking about the shot I was talking about you" and put 200$ down on the bar, and his hotel key. (I guess I should mention I am strawberry blond) Still grosses me out to think about it. 




 He's running a marathon, I follow a blogger who snapped this photo. Here is the link with an interview with the guy pictured for those interested.

 There are plenty of intellectuals who smoke. I have a masters and most of the people in my career field are well in formed educated people. Most of us smoke weed in moderation. We hang out, cook dinner, play music, talk about societies issues, and laugh really hard about silly things. It can be a great tool to unwind and relax with friends. I completely agree that stoners, like any one who abuses a substance give it a stigma that I wouldn't want to associate with either. 

tl;dr find cool people to smoke with instead of stoners

 I went to college, got a masters, interned and volunteered in related fields, ...then I accidentally on purpose let my boss see my boobs . I shattered the fuck out of the glass ceiling with my boobs
