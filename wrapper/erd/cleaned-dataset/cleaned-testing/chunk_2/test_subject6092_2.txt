 This girl liked me on okcupid, so I checked her profile out and she was great. Looked like she knew what she was doing in life, was really beautiful and we had a few likes in common. So I message her and no luck. Similar things have happened with 3 girls in the past night alone. I try not to get hung up in one person, but it's sometimes so confusing. Do you guys/girls have any messaging tips?  




 Well this outbreak has been going on almost year long and it just became news recently. Yeah you're right though. 




 It isn't. The genetic code is 97% similar, but I haven't seen many places refer to it as the ebola strain. That doesn't change anything I said though.  




 I said there is a very small chance it would spread to someone through a sneeze. If someone sneezed directly on you that's different. If you're in a room with someone who has ebola and they sneeze, you have a small chance of catching it. What I said was not false information.  




 Yeah I think you're right, but I wouldn't suggest being in contact with much urine regardless haha. 
It's really good that people are aware this is happening now, but more people need to understand how little of a risk first world nations face.  




 Healthcare workers get infected because they aren't always trained up to first world standards in Africa. Some of the doctors are great over there some of them aren't. Ebola patients require 24/7 monitoring and are often stressful patients to work with. A lot of them get sick because they don't always properly clean rooms or isolate patients. If this were a flu you should be slightly worried. Ebola is held to mainly villages and quite frankly village people can't afford to fly over to the US or any first world nation. I wouldn't even be worried if I was working in Penn station. Now my knowledge of this is limited to my schooling. I'm going to school hoping to work for the CDC when I graduate so I only know this from what I've read and learned. I have 0 hands on experience with ebola. It does sound like an experimental cure has been very successful down in Atlanta. Avoid bodily fluids and you will be fine. What I've learned is to get people educated on the disease they're worried about and get them away from ignorance. Ebola isn't a big risk. 




 That's good because you can literally worry yourself sick. I'm glad I can help! Stay healthy!  




 There is a very little chance it would. It isn't a respiratory illness so there's a very small chance of that. If there is blood in the sneeze, it's a little higher of a chance if the blood touches you. I wouldn't worry about a sneeze. If someone pisses on you, shits on you, bleeds on you or vomits on you be worried. It really only spreads to family members, village members and health care workers. If you see anyone who looks like they have the flu, avoid them. Which I think is just common sense. Ebola starts off with flu like symptoms, then progresses rapidly. Don't worry about ebola unless you've come into contact with someone from west Africa or someone who just came from west Africa if they are sick. Very little reason to be worried. I cannot stress that enough. 




 The way it spreads shouldn't worry someone unless you eat bushmeat or are directly caring for someone with ebola. It doesn't spread easily. It's spreading because family members try to care for those infected with ebola. It wouldn't spread much in a developed country. You should only worry about your safety if you're dealing with a sick person who just came from west Africa or was in contact with someone from west Africa. Even if you don't live in a very developed country you shouldn't worry about it. Avoid those who are sick and throwing up. Don't touch urine, blood, saliva, feces and other bodily fluids that aren't your own. There really is no reason to panic about ebola. A flu panic is something that's reasonable in a developed nation. Ebola is not.  




 Ebola Zaire which isn't responsible for this outbreak kills 90%. This one is 60-70% which is still nasty. A lot of people are freaking out because of how fast it is spreading for an ebola outbreak and how long it is lasting. People jump to ill-advised conclusions that it might be airborne now, but it's surely not. The outbreak would be larger than it is now. This outbreak is spreading at this rate and for this long because it isn't killing that quickly for an ebola strain so more people can come into contact with an infected person. No need to panic if you're in a wealthy country or outside of Africa. 




 Ebola can still spread for about 2 months after infection via semen. I would advise he doesn't have sex for 2 months after he's 100%.  




 You shouldn't worry about getting ebola unless you plan on coming in contact with a sick individual's bodily fluids. This ebola strain is very similar to the Ebola Zaire which means it is very unlikely it's airborne. This strain is spreading faster because it is killing a smaller number of people than the Zaire strain. I believe the Zaire strain killed 90% of infected, this one is killing roughly 65% of infected. 
Unless it becomes airborne don't worry. 
If for any reason you believe you could be sick, stay hydrated and see a medical professional.  




 That I'm a very angry Jewish person.  




 Reston ebola, it didn't spread to humans though. 




 Exactly this. Vaccine companies wouldn't make enough profit considering all the work that would need to be done. Sadly creating a vaccine is only going to happen if profits will be made. The big buyers are going to be from first world nations and quite frankly, ebola poses little risk in those nations at the moment. The demand is simply too little for who is going to be able to buy it. Vaccine creation would take some time also. It doesn't exactly happen overnight.  




 DUDE SAME! Except I did mine in 10th grade. It's exciting. It's almost an adrenaline rush when I see these updates. It's like a movie with real consequences. It hurts to think that people suffer mightily from ebola, but we must understand suffering is something that happens. I've read books on infectious disease since I was like 13 and I want to try to do work for the CDC when I finish my education. I don't really want to see this become a huge pandemic, but the thought of living through one is exhilarating. If it spreads worldwide I pray everyone to have the best luck. Maybe better sanitary conditions can prevent it in western countries, but maybe they won't. We don't really know how powerful ebola could be. We might be on the brink of witnessing it's potential.  




 Do you think FIFA would fine countries football programs or players who said they would choose to not play in this World Cup?  




 Made me think of Larry David 




 Maybe she asked out of pity 




 Really? Two years ago a banker came into a class of mine and was telling us that identity fraud was incredibly tough to prove. What a douche bag trying to bait potential criminals. Thank you for teaching me the correct thing, not that I would ever break the law like that. 

Edit: somehow identity turned into indentured...  




 I heard fraud is one of the hardest crimes to actually get caught for  




 I think OP watched Die Hard with a Vengeance on AMC yesterday.   




 As someone moving to brookyln soon I'm glad I saw this thread. I would think walking around looking bummy would work. That was going to be my strategy until I got more accustomed to the city. 




 Hey I've been home for about an hour now, to find that my roommate ate the last of my food. A pizza right now would be spectacular.  




 Well now you're just being vulgar.  




 I'll find it, thank you very much!  




 Seinfeld. It's a show about nothing, yet it is very relatable.  




 So striking. 




 What is that drink, is that a sort of coffee? I've never seen it. Where can I get some? 




 Let's address the real issue here: what kind of asshole points out that someone has a boner?  




 Somewhat bad? What the hell does that mean?  




 Ya know, I only get this once in awhile. It's like my dick has selective pissing around other people!  




 Virgin here: masturbation.  




 And the cow says booooo because the joke sucks.  




 Well now people will get so excited they pissed that they will forget to breathe again.  




 I think I would try to drink the screen if I was playing that game!  




 The only faith you really need in a time where you're questioning religious faith is faith in yourself.  




 Relax, you're making pranks out to be some kind of existential crisis. I mean, I follow "live every week like it's shark week" as much as the next guy, but sometimes we need to let the sharks go by.  




 Hey, I feel this way every day. Just try to be happy and positive. You'll be surprised at what this can do. It sucks at first, but you can do it. "Live every week like it's shark week." That's the best advice I've ever heard.  




 Let's keep my faith quiet. I won't use a throwaway though, too much work. What you're going through is common. Just look towards the sky and as long as you can see the sky you have a reason to be happy. 




 You might wanna get that checked out. That is a high level of pranks per day. The cut off is 345. If you're committing more than 345 pranks per day, you have a problem and should seek professional help.  




 Proud of you, bro-man. 




 Yeah man, she's not your ship so don't go with the captain goes down with the ship mentality. That can be painful. Just jump ship. Don't mention it though. Just cut her off. I mean, if you happen to see her say hi, nothing more.  




 Just stop. You're being an unnecessary asshole. Next thing you know the dog is going to be at a shelter because of your little prank.  




 She starts to be curt with her responses in conversation. You can sort of feel a negative vibe coming from the other person when you're texting, at least I think so.
