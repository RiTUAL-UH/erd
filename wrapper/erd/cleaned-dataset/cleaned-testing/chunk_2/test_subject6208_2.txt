 See I'm on both sides. Place Beyond the Pines and Only God Forgives are two of my favorites of the year. 




 But the thing about voice acting is, is that you can really only covey emotions through your voice. Some of the greatest acting performances are more than just saying things with words. It's also saying things with your body. Your mannerisms. You brought up Mark Hamill's Joker vs Heath Ledger's. Yes Mark Hamill's Joker is great, and I'd say probably more iconic, but what makes Heath Ledger's Joker incredible is his mannerisms. They way he walks, moves his hands, his body language, how he licks his lips. These are things you just cannot do as a voice actor.  




 Because I can think of a few actors/actresses that deserve to be nominated more than someone who did voice work. I understand voice work isn't easy, but it just wouldn't be fair to nominate someone who did a voice over instead of someone who actually was physically there. Physically acting with more than just their voice. Acting includes not just voice, but expression of the face and body. Some of what makes acting performances great are the subtle things they do with their face and body. 

Edit: I should clarify that I DO agree that voice actors should be recognized. What they do is incredible and not everyone can do it. What I'm saying is that *acting* acting and *voice* acting are two different things. They require different kinds of performances. Voice acting is about how you convey a character through voice while *acting* acting is about how you convey a character not only through voice, but through your mannerisms. They way you walk, move your hands, the way you look and so on. Things you simply cannot do as a voice actor.

It might be weird to segregate a Best Voice Acting category and a Best Actor category, but it makes sense. We have two separate writing categories: one for original screenplay and adapted screenplay. We have two separate Best Picture categories: one for animated and one for live action. Why can't we just have two separate acting categories? That way voice actors don't have to compete with *actor* actors. I don't think voice actors should be treated differently, but they do. Given a choice between a voice actor and an *actor* actor, the Academy will always choose the latter. Is it fair? No, but that's the way it is. If you lump voice acting in with Best Actor, they will almost always never get the award. They might not even get a nomination, but if there were a category for voice acting then they would get the notoriety they deserve every year. 




 What ever happened to Killer Crow? 




 We do agree but we don't. I agree with everything you've said, but I think where we disagree is the whole "good movies are good movies" thing, and I'm okay with that. I still think that as long as a movie is good, it's good. I don't care if it's a remake, or whatever. I'd rather see a really good movie that isn't the most original thing than an original movie that's bad. And that's just my preference. I'm not saying that all original movies are bad, in fact, some really great movies are original. But at the same time, there have been some really good movies that are remakes, sequels, prequels, reboots, adaptions or whatever. 




 You do realize I said basically the same thing, right? I never said anything about shot for shot remakes. 




 If this is true then this is sad. Good movies are good movies. It shouldn't matter if it's a remake, sequel, prequel or whatever. It's not fair to just write off a movie and give it a bad review simply because it's a remake, sequel, prequel, reboot of whatever.  




 Side by Side, Senna, Samsara, and Dear Zachary are incredible documentaries. Especially Samsara.  




 Are these legit reviews and is it really that bad or are people prejudging this movie? I haven't seen any reviews yet. This is a movie I'm really looking forward to and it bums me out to see it at below average because that means that it's either genuinely bad, or people don't want to like it and are hating on it. 

  




 So I'm making a Christmas sweater. [This](http://therightprofile.blogspot.com/2011/12/now-i-have-machine-gun-ho-ho-ho.html?m=1) one to be particular. My question is what should I use to write on it to achieve that clean, bright look? A sharpie? Paint? Or what? Thanks in advance!  




 So in English we watched a documentary called [Salute](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0874317/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). You can read the story [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Olympics_Black_Power_salute). Basically, my teacher wants us to write an argumentative essay about something from 1968, using the movie as one of our sources. I decided to compare the black power movement to the gay rights movement. So far all I have is a thesis statement, but I'm having a hard time coming up with points and how to structure my introduction paragraph.

My thesis statement also needs to be improved in terms of wording. My thesis statement says: "Racism in the 1960's was so strong, that it would have been better if it was a gay rights sign instead of a black power sign." I can't figure out how to word it though.

But I really need help coming up with arguments to support my thesis. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Tell us what is holding you up. 




 **Rock Band 3**: This is a game I never really stopped playing. I play it like every week. Man, this game is great. Definitely one of my all time favorites. So many songs. But as I was playing this past week I started thinking about if we'd ever see another Rock Band game. With the new consoles and everything they're capable of, it'd be interesting to see a next gen Rock Band game. But only if they allow us to import all the songs we've bought. I don't really know of anything they could do better in Rock Band 4 or whatever they'd call it other than graphical stuff and maybe allow us to upload our own music?

**Fallout 3**: This is a game I played when it first came out. Got to like level 5 and wasn't having any fun so I stopped. I guess it was because I had never played a game like it before so I didn't know *how* to play it. So a few years later Skyrim comes out and I try it and fall in love with it. Over a hundred hours of Skyrim later, and I decide to go back to Fallout 3. I am absolutely loving it now. I've been playing it so much this past week. I guess Skyrim was sort of a good introduction to that style of game, and because I was use to it, Fallout went from feeling so foreign to feeling so natural and fun. Now I'm looking into playing New Vegas, but yeah, Fallout 3 is so incredible. 




 No one will stop you. 




 That'd be a fantastic feel-good movie! 




 What does that have to do with anything? 









 300 - Prepare for Glory

No Country for Old Men - There are no clean getaways.

Cobra - Crime is a disease. Meet the cure.

Evil Dead - The most terrifying film you will ever experience. (Even though it wasn't, when that tagline was released it was so bold and got me so hyped.) 




 Brandon Lee's accidental death on the set of The Crow.

"In the fatal scene, which called for the revolver to be actually fired at Lee from a distance of 12-15 feet, the dummy cartridges were exchanged with blank rounds, which feature a live powder charge and primer, but no bullet, thus allowing the gun to be fired without the risk of an actual projectile. But since the bullet from the dummy round was already trapped in the barrel, this caused the .44 Magnum bullet to be fired out of the barrel with virtually the same force as if the gun had been loaded with a live round, and it struck Lee in the abdomen, mortally wounding him. He was rushed to the New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington, NC where he underwent 6 hours of surgery. However, attempts to save him were unsuccessful, and Lee was pronounced dead at 1:03pm on March 31, 1993 at the age of 28. The shooting was ruled an accident." 




 That's why I said "I'd". As in "I" would. 




 Things like cameras, tripods, lenses, mics, etc 




 Yeah I use to rent this movie like every weekend! I'd love to see it again. And thanks for the gold, it was so unexpected! 




 Lawrence of Arabia is fantastic, but I'd say 2001 owns the 60's. 









 It'd be funny though if they gave you the gold instead of /u/Vendredi8 




 Man, that movie's the sickest! 




 Don't they check your receipt at the door when you leave Walmart? 









 Hmm maybe he did mean Chang. I thought it was interesting though some of the similarities Julian and One Eye had. Like the fact that they both had one eye and SPOILERS!!!!! 

how Julian cuts open someone's stomach just like One Eye also how Julian was pretty much silent. 

But it could be Chang. One Eye was basically Odin and Chang is also God like.  




 I think its hard to say without knowing what you like, but Holy Motors is a truly strange and unique film. That movie is so strange and it just sticks with you.  




 I think Nicolas Refn hinted that Ryan Gosling's character in Only God Forgives is the character One Eye from Valhalla Rising reincarnated.  




 I don't know what it would be nominated for but The Place Beyond the Pines was great. 

Also regardless of what people think about Only God Forgives, that movie has some great cinematography and music.  




 Okay one more quick question. What does it mean by EA disk? Can I go to gamestop and find it? Is it easy to find? 




 That video makes it look easy. Is it as easy as it seems? I'm not great with computers. Also thanks! 




 How *do* you get custom songs? 




 Sorry? I couldn't find one on Amazon so I looked elsewhere and that was the only one I found. If people can find it for less that's great! I don't know why I was downvoted. I didn't pick the price.

I was just trying to be helpful :(

Edit: Wow first I get downvoted for trying to help then I get downvoted for apologizing. Real cool guys.  




 A weird question, but I was wondering if there were any songs that are similar to Nine Inch Nails songs from the album The Fragile. I know there are NIN songs available but none are from the Fragile. 

Like songs that are kind of epic style rock and loud? 




 Why not? 




 [Here](http://www.retrofestive.ca/grumpy-cat-jingle-all-the-way-to-hell-ugly-sweater/) 




 I think if it is real they revealed too much with the logo. If they wanted people to be guessing what it was they wouldn't have such a dead giveaway to fallout. That logo pretty much kills the surprise.  




 I'm looking for some good thanksgiving movies to watch with my family. It doesn't have to explicitly be *about* thanksgiving but it can also take place during thanksgiving. Just looking for some good movies that go with the thanksgiving season.  




 It's always kind of bugged me when actors complain about how hard their job is. I get acting is hard, I've done it before, and it's okay to say it's hard, but don't complain. You make millions of dollars. There are millions of people who would kill to be in your position. 




 Man this is sad to hear. I loved his music so much. 




 I actually think it'd be pretty cool to see "Wicked" versions of other Disney villains.  









 I love how people call it a dog game yet there are like only two parts where you use the dog. 




 Mystic River is absolutely fantastic.  




 Immortals. I'd recommend it to my friend who likes Greek mythology and loved 300.  




 That movie was the sickest! 




 I dunno man, if they collected phones at the beginning of detention I could still see it working.  




 In all honesty though, I feel like Breakfast Club is one one of those movies that *could* be remade like every thirty years to appeal to that generation at the time. The basic idea of that movie is timeless. There will always be kids, always be high school and always be detention. Just update the slang and fashion and BOOM! You have a competent and relevant remake that will always work.  




 It's totally fine to think the Dark Knight is one of the greatest movies. People get a lot of crap for thinking that, but TDK *is* a great movie. It's exceptionally well made, well acted and well directed. The only reason people say it can't be one of the greats is because it's new. But in like fifteen years when it gets "old" I think people will be okay calling it one of the greatest movies made.  




 Not really. A movie can be mind blowing or awe inspiring and still not be your favorite. Avatar is nowhere near my favorite movie, but it's something I'd love to see again for the first time. 




 Oh wow! This totally might be it. I'm about to watch some videos of it to find out for sure. But this might be it! 




 This isn't it. What bugs me is that I'd immediately recognize its name if I heard it.  









 So in this animated movie, probably early 90s, there was a talking puppy and a talking owl. Maybe more animals? And maybe in a castle? House? It's not a lot to go on but all I remember.  




 I thought the scene in Watchmen when a younger, less experienced Rorschach finds the pedophile. That was pretty intense.  




 Honestly though this should be the least of people's worries. This is a REALLY DUMB thing to complain about because it affects absolutely nothing in terms of games and hardware.  




 Honestly though this should be the least of people's worries. This is a REALLY DUMB thing to complain about because it affects absolutely nothing in terms of games and hardware.  




 Yeah, of all the things people complain about in terms of Xbox One, this is seriously the thing they should care about the least.  




 I'm right handed and I've always gotten disks out with my left hand. 

It'll feel weird on the left side at first but in a few months or so it won't be a big deal and people will get use to it I think.  




 I don't know the law well but can cops shoot me if I punch a bunch of people? I love fist fighting in this game but then the cops come and shoot me and ruin it :(

Also screw the cops that hang on the side of SUVs and box you in and shoot you to death.  




 Or a system that let's you explain yourself to the cops and be like, "Yo sorry man this was totes an accident!"

Or at least just get a small fine instead of it being either cops die or you die.  




 I always hate though how slowly you break into cars. You have to go through the entire "look and make sure no one sees me, bash window, slowly get in and slowly hotwire the car" animation. The cops are after you! They are shooting you! Don't check to see if they are watching you break in! Just smash the window, hop in and start it as quickly as you can!!! 




 Then box you in, preventing you from going anywhere then shoot you to death.  




 I feel like the only way to escape five stars in GTA V is either by train or underground tunnel.  




 I will say though occasionally there is that super awesome moment of suspense when you're hiding at the end of an alley and the cops walking towards you. Then right before they get to you, your wanted goes away.  




 I got five stars and went to Trevor's airstrip and got into a plane because it seemed like the only possible way to escape. It was a HUGE ordeal getting in the air. But once in the air I thought I was home free. Nope. Helicopters kept spawning in front of me. Gave up trying to lose them and just flew into a building and died. I'm not giving them the satisfaction of killing me. 

Someone summed up the cops in GTA V perfectly. "The cops in GTA V would murder their families if it meant killing you." 




 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the Movie 




 I'm playing through Fallout 3 for the second time. The first time I really didn't enjoy it. I think it was because it was so different from anything I had played before that I didn't know how to play. So then I played Skyrim and loved it! So this past week I went back to Fallout 3 and I'm really loving it now.

So my question is, what's the word on Fallout 4? Has it been officially announced? Are there any details or leaks about it? The technical leaps Bethesda has made since Fallout 3 really get me excited about Fallout 4. If it's happening that is. Any info about it? 




 Looking for someplace that has pork buns.  




 Just what is your favorite tv show theme song or opening credits? 




 Looking for Christmas songs. Doesn't matter what the song is or who it's by. If it's Christmas themed, I want it. 









 I love movies where the main character(s) hallucinates and the line between whats real and fake becomes blurred. They lose their grip on reality for whatever reason. Like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or The Shining or Pi. What are some good movies like this? Movies where they hallucinate and lose their grip on reality and can no longer separate what's real and fake. 




 I'm looking for some good movies with religious undertones. Maybe movies about someone finding or rediscovering their faith in God. It doesn't even have to explicitly be about God, but someone finding or rediscovering their faith in a greater power. Maybe destiny? I'm thinking specifically like Terrence Malick films how they have beautiful religious undertones like The Thin Red Line, The Tree of Life and To the Wonder.  









 I love M83 and am looking for similar music. I'm mostly referring to their songs [My Tears Are Becoming a Sea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLuc8vjny5c) and [Outro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWdiaS3uq4) 




 I really love Nine Inch Nails' album The Fragile. I don't know what it is about it I like, but what are some other albums, artists, or songs with a similar style and feel to The Fragile album? 




 I really liked whoever opened up for NIN in Nashville but don't know who they were or what songs they played.  









 They don't even have to be your favorite ones. I'm just looking for some decent movies that are about Thanksgiving or take place during Thanksgiving. 




 I'm looking for a post that was on here. Although it might have been posted to r/pics. But I'm pretty sure it was posted here. 

It was a pic of a gorilla with a weird look. The title said something along the lines of "He gave me this look after I mouthed something" 




 What movie do you think does the best job at character development? Like fleshing out their characters to where they don't feel like characters anymore, but feel more like real people. A movie where by the end of it, you feel like you've known the characters for years and therefore feel a connection to them. 




 I don't watch horror movies so I've never seen any of these but I've heard good things about them. 

Inside

Martyrs

Rec (original one)

The Descent

Could you tell me which of these would be best to watch? Or if you have a better suggestion? Newer horror movies from like 1998 to present are preferred unless you know of an older one that still holds up well. Like I said, I don't frequently watch horror movies so I don't know which are good.  














 I feel like it's been a while since we've heard anything regarding it. Anyone know when it's supposed to be released? I know Volition said it was going to be released close to the games release, but it's already October 9th. 




 Anything from clothes, mannerisms, and everything in between. 









 Is there really even a point to wearing a mask in single player free roam? I remember before the game was released they were talking about masks and made it sound like Red Dead Redemption. Like you would go into an inventory, put a mask on, cause some mayhem, then once you get out of the line of sight of the cops you could remove the mask and lose your wanted level. 

The only way to equip and remove your mask is by going in your home. So is there really even a point to having a mask in the game?
 




 What movies do you think have the best sound design and sound effects? 









 I love movies like Starship Troopers and Jarhead. War movies that focus more on bootcamp, living with a troop and the life of a soldier. War movies that don't really focus on the war and action pert but more on the training and life of a soldier. Not like Saving Private or Black Hawk Down where the focus is on the battle. Any movies or TV shows like this? 














 Purpose: It's mostly going to  be something to carry on a daily basis. Used for things like opening stuff, basic uses, and even, god forbid, self defense if the situation calls for it.(I live in a very rough neighborhood)

Size: I'm looking for something not too big, but still a good size. Something that fits comfortably in a pants pocket.

Knife type: Folding knife is best

Price Range: I'd like to not spend more than $100 if possible.

Type/Style: I don't go camping too often, but I'd love to have something pretty rugged that could handle the great outdoors.

Blade Type: Plain edge is preferred, but a combo of plain and serrated is okay too! 

Blade Steel: I don't know or understand enough about steel to make a good educated guess on what steel would be best. I'm not picky. I guess something that stays sharp longer, but without being too pricy.

Anything else: Nothing else really. Just need a good, durable everyday knife that will last a long time.

If you need anymore info I'd love to give it. Thanks for any and all help! 




 I have very straight and fine and thin hair so I often run into the problem that every product I've used so far makes my hair look and feel gross. Like really greasy. What are some good styling products that work well with my kind of hair and won't make it look and feel gross? 














 I re-watched The Strangers yesterday and that movie may not be the best (I love it), but there is one scene in that movie that's so great. The woman is just walking around her kitchen then out of nowhere the masked dude just walks up on the back door and watches her. No loud music, no sudden movements, no jump scare, just great subtle horror.

Now I'm looking for other horror movies that have great subtle horror. Any ideas? 




 So I was dropping off Jimmy somewhere after switching to Michael and was wondering what would happen if I ran Jimmy over. Turns out that when I ran him over, Michael yelled, "No! No! No!" I got out and Jimmy didn't move.

A day latter I called Jimmy and it was busy. Did I kill Jimmy for good? 




 I just want to screw around in the world with no consequences. I've heard conflicting info on if this cheat is real or not. Is it just no one ha discovered it yet? 




 And what would it basically be about? Buddy cop, road trip, etc.

This question was inspired by a question /u/ctopherrun asked on here regarding a Michael Clarke Duncan/Terry Crews buddy movie. 

But yeah, who are your picks, alive or dead, to see in a buddy comedy movie? 




 I was wondering if anyone has heard anything about when we might see a trailer. It feels weird that there have already been two trailers shown at comic con yet nothing for the public and it's released in May next year.

Godzilla is one of my most anticipated movies and I just want to see something. Does anyone know when they plan on showing a teaser or something? 




 I'm looking for a subreddit like battlestations where people post pics of their setup, but for more home entertainment like stuff. Like console gamers or pictures of entertainment set ups. I don't game on a pc. Mostly xbox. I'm about to redesign my living room and I'm just looking for inspiration, but all I can find really on battlestations are pics of desktops.

Is there a subreddit like battlestations geared more towards console gamers or home entertainment setups?

We stumbled upon this picture of my grandfather and uncle. They passed away some time ago. I was wondering if someone could colorize this photo for my father. Thanks in advance! 









 I don't ever play strategy games but kind of want to. What are some good strategy games for the 360 for beginners that aren't too complicated? Something to ease me in? 




 Like real adventure movies were someone goes on an adventure or journey or something. Like Up or something. I just can't think of many good adventure movies besides the obvious ones.

So what are your favorite adventure movies? 




 So in the mission where you rescue Asha, the one where you fight your evil twin, I noticed something great. 

When you sneak up on the dude talking to his wife/girlfriend, I just sat there for like more than five minutes just listening to him going, "Mmmmmhmmmmm." crying from all the laughter.

Did anyone else notice this or get as much joy from it as I did? 














 College professor of film or Forensics? There really aren't any specifics. I guess just assume anything and everything. I want help thinking of all the pros and cons of these two career options. I'm at a crossroads in my life and need help understanding the pros and cons so I can better figure out which is best for me. Forget about which one I prefer. All I care about is which is better in terms of the pros and cons.

If there is a better place to post this please let me know.
 














 I wanted to use the slowmo cheat because it sounds cool, but it doesn't work. It's listed as a cheat on multiple sites. There is also a fast forward cheat, but it does work. I found out that the slowmo cheat is "Silverlink"? What does that mean? Someone said it was unlocked when you finish the game. It didn't unlock for me and I can't find any videos of the slowmo cheat. So is it real?  




 So yesterday I asked what your favorite mission was, but I figured that there are some missions that weren't my favorite, but had some of my favorite moments. So I'm asking a slightly different question that should allow more of a variety of answers and discussion. 




 Pretty simple question. What was your favorite mission? 









 For some reason I love watching love story dramas, where the relationship is tragic. Something like Blue Valentine or A Moment to Remember. What are some films with heart-wrenchingly tragic love stories?  









 I watched Pain and Gain the other night and I was thinking the entire time, "Man, this is some super dark humor." But I kind of liked it. I enjoy dark humor, so I was wondering what movies you guys have seen that has had some really dark humor. What movie has had some of the darkest humor you've seen? 














 I have the link to the video. It's been cut down to the right length, I just need it in gif format with text matching the words, but no text with the "Haha", just the part where he says words.

Thank you! 




 I saw this short film purely because it was suggested in the "Related" section. It was about an artist whose wife dies. Then he builds a sculpture to remember her. As the short progresses, he slowly becomes a statue while his statue of his wife slowly becomes human. Really weird, but beautiful short film. Anyways, can't remember the name and want to show it to someone. Can anyone help? 









 I watched Spy Kids 2 the other day. I loved it when I was a kid, but as a teen I just thought it was terrible. However, as an adult I loved it! I thought it was kind of genius and couldn't help but to love it. I think it's because as an adult, I realized it wasn't really meant to be taken seriously, but instead is suppose to be cheesy. I haven't had that much fun watching a movie in a long time. 

So I got to thinking, what kids movies do you enjoy or understand or appreciate more now that you're an adult? 









 When I heard there were going to be voice sliders I got super excited. But when I fired up the Inauguration Station, created a character, and went to choose his voice, I was sad to see that the voice slider, while it does adjust the pitch, unfortunately gives your character a robotic sound whenever the slider is on anything other than normal. Maybe it's not that big of a deal, but I was just kind of disappointed. 




 Also, what areas should I stay away from when looking for a place to live? Also, would it be cheaper to rent an apartment or buy/rent a house? And what neighborhoods are not only good, but have a reasonable cost of living? If you need any more info, please let me know. I've only been to LA once when I was little and don't know what to look for or where to look. I'm extremely grateful for any and all help/advice! Also, do you know of any great online resources I can find with info on real estate as well as other housing. I live across the country and cannot afford to visit LA frequently. 









 My birthday is coming up this week and me and a few friends are just going to hang out and eat pizza. My question is, what place in Memphis or surrounding areas has the best pizza? Doesn't matter if they do delivery or not. Just looking for the best pizza in the city and neighboring towns. 




 Like the blood effects when someone is shot. I'm interested in which movies you think have the best blood hits. It doesn't have to be an action movie. Even if only one person in the movie is shot, if it's good, I want to know about it. Doesn't matter how realistic or over the top it is, practical effects or CGI, doesn't matter. However, I prefer something visually appealing, but I'm open to any and all suggestions. I'm just interested in the different styles and looks of blood hits there are and want to know which ones you think are the best. 




 I heard a song recently, maybe a pop song, but it's recent. It features what sounds like either a marimba or steel drums. It's not fast paced though, but not too slow. That's really all I know about it. I don't even know the lyrics other than part of the chorus that goes something like, "She something something something." Obviously they don't say "something". The somethings represent how many words there are in the chorus. So he says, "She" then says like three more words. I know it's not much info, but I appreciate any help. 




 I heard a song at work today and loved the beat and rhythm of it, but don't know what it is. I know it's fairly recent because we only pay recent music, but not top forty stuff. I've never heard this song anywhere else before. I know one lyric, "I'll love you until the end of time." Or something like that. It's a pop song with a sort of middle eastern beat/rhythm to it however the singer sounds American. I know that at the end of the song he says, "Until theee eeeeennnndddd ooooof tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiime."

The song has a pretty chill sound to it. It's not a slow love song. Definitely more of a pop song.

I know this isn't a lot to go on, but it's all I got. 

Edit: New details: Most likely male singer. Also I should clarify what I mean by recent. What I mean by recent is like this year.  




 So I watched Samsara recently and two shots struck me with how powerful and how much they said without saying anything. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=PAeIDRzGZ1A t=3660) one of a geisha shedding a tear, showing how hard her life must be. And [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=PAeIDRzGZ1A t=4602) one of a disfigured war veteran at a memorial cemetery, showing the price for peace and the cost of war.

Are there any other great shots like these? Ones that say so much without saying hardly any dialogue? You know what I mean? Sort of like how a picture is worth a thousand words kind of thing? What are some great examples of this in film? Shots that are so powerful and say so much with so little. I hope I explained myself well. I'm not really looking for scenes per se, more so just single shots. 









 What scenes are your favorite uses of the quiet scream? Where a character screams but the sound of his scream is cut out. Think Dark Knight when Harvey is in the hospital bed and he screams but it's muted out. Or more recently The Artist where the main character has his hallucination and he drops to his knees and screams but is not heard.  




 I'm trying to find movies where the opening scene is basically a quiet, typical opener, then BAM! Something in the vein of the opening scene of [Children of Men](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCTgUq6hzUk). Clive Owen just gets some coffee walks out of the shop, then BOOM! a bomb goes off then title card.

Or Reservoir Dogs. Starts with them having a comical, friendly conversation, then all of the sudden it goes to Orange in the back seat bleeding to death and screaming.

Or think Dark Knight when SPOILER!!!!!!!!! Rachel dies. Shes talking to Harvey, everything's fine, then BOOM, out of nowhere the building explodes.

Another great example isn't a movie, but rather a video posted a few days ago. Where a woman is driving for like 20 seconds then out of nowhere without warning, a car comes flying at her. 

I'm really looking for that contrast of when a scene goes from quaint and quiet to fucked in less than a second. 

I guess it doesn't have to be an opening scene, but it's preferred. The only real stipulation is that it has to be a pretty normal non action scene at first then out of nowhere something happens.  









 So me and my mom watched this Korean movie on Netflix called [A Moment to Remember](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428870/?ref_=sr_1). I have to say it is one of the best movies I've seen as well as one of the saddest, most heart breaking, yet beautiful. We bawled our eyes out. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and see this film. 









 I work at American Eagle and supposedly all American Eagles play the same music, so that might help. I only know brief parts of the choruses of the two songs.

The first is a punk rock sounding song with a female vocalist (or at least they sound female). The chorus goes something like: "She said don't forget your friends, I know; Don't forget your friends, I won't; don't forget your friends." Or at least it sounds a lot like that.

The second song I have even less info on. It's a pop song sung by an extremely British guy. So much so that when he says "No" it sounds like, "Now". The chorus goes a little like: "Never gonna get, never gonna gt it, no." I know that's super vague, but at work I can't focus on the lyrics plus it's not ever loud enough.

I only hear these songs at work and I've tried looking up the American Eagle playlist, but still can't find them. I'm grateful for any and all help! Thanks!  




 I was really into this movie I was watching but then when someone died, it was really terrible cgi gore. So I was thinking, what are you're favorite uses of practical gore effects? What scenes really stick out to you when it comes to practical makeup effects? 




 Saw it yesterday and wanted to read some discussions on it, but there are no threads. 

I don't really enjoy horror, but I wanted to see it purely because I heard it was a well made film. I have to say I thought the direction was really great as well as the acting. I thought the first half was fantastic, but I thought the second half, while still good, felt not as great or scary. All in all I thought this was one of the best horrors in years. 

So what did you guys think? Really want to get a discussion started! 




 I moved away recently and don't know anyone where I live now. My birthday is in a few weeks and I got a little depressed because I have no one to spend it with. Then I thought, "Hey, this doesn't have to be a sad thing!" So, now I'm trying to figure out what I can do on my birthday by myself that will be nice, fun, or enjoyable. I don't want to spend my birthday thinking about how alone I am. I want to enjoy it!

So what are some cool/nice/enjoyable things I can do on my birthday without being sad?
