 Oh man, The Thing would could REALLY go either way. The organic effects would be so interesting though. Things twisting and turning and melting and growing... Might try this. Although it might be especially disturbing. I tried playing Octodad while tripping once and now tentacles freak me out so who knows. 




 I love horror and dark things in general. I've always been afraid to put on a dark movie I enjoy or a horror game in case I go into a bad trip or something because of it. What about you guys? 









 Whether it be a microscope or a telescope, you will never see the end. 




 You're right. That's why this is still confusing for me. Dammit, we really need to make that timeline/flowchart already... 




 But wait a minute, isn't HM 2 set in '89-90's? 




 So, in the first game [Beard mentions to Jacket that none of this is really happening](/spoiler).

So, are we in a dream? Are we in Hell? Is Richard the Devil? Either way, it seems like their world may not be set in reality. Thoughts? 




 Fuck your artificial barriers and fuck your shipment of goods as well. 




 Despite the somewhat vague post, I feel like I completely understand where this is coming from. One time I tripped I thought of circles and how everything seems to be a circle or sphere.

Everything is infinite. 




 That's good to hear, I was beginning to think I was the only one with this mindset! 




 I just feel like some people, like me, can lose themselves too much in the trip. For instance; At one point I almost convinced myself that I should live my life alone because that's all I know how to do. Which isn't healthy in reality. Putting good judgement into things is never a bad idea in my opinion. 




 Completely agree with this. Nothing is written in stone, so to speak. As much as our world wants to believe it is. It's scary and wonderful at the same time. 




 Yeah, I've definitely had my fair share of revelations. But take everything you experience from your trip with a grain of salt, if you will. Think back when you're sober just to be sure you were thinking clearly. There's been many people, myself included, that have had false revelations. It can go either way but just use your best judgment! 




 Dude, I've been wanting to trip out and play this! haha

Never say never (; 




 Encouraging what? If I say "I took two hits" in an LSD forum it doesn't take a genius to connect the dots. I can say Grateful Dead all I want and there's no rule here that says I can't. That's all I have left to say to you. 




 Get off your high horse, I didn't come to LSD for bad vibes... 




 So when Interstellar was still playing in theaters I decided to go see it with my sister and that we would both take two hits of some Grateful Dead. So I wanted to time it perfectly so we'd be tripping by the time the movie started. I gave us a 45 min window and I toked a bit on the car ride to help the peak.

We go in the theater and, surprise, there's these two empty seats right in the Goldie Locks zone of the theater! These seats... where fucking leather armchairs that reclined and all! I saw these seats and I was pissing myself with excitement. We get chilled and then the trailers start. It's hard remembering any of them but they were pretty intense for the most part. Then, the feature presentation begins. Fucking Interstellar.

This fucking movie was just the perfect setting for a trip. Great story, great acting, emotional, great cinematography, and it's about fucking space! The scene where it's just static shots of Saturn and the calm thunderstorm sounds are playing (When the one character puts on the Sounds of Nature CD to calm down) was just perfect. Absolutely beautiful.

Here's something I really loved about it; When a certain topic came up in conversation in the movie (Love, time travel, God, etc.) it was like a roundtable discussion. They didn't let anything fly over your head, they almost explained it directly to the audience with pictures and metaphors and everything. Great learning experience. When they were arguing about love it was just like, DAMN. Also, the first time they go through the black hole and look at the videos from back home over the last however many years... I almost cried with them aha Powerful stuff.

Then, the climax of the movie hits. Everything has been getting more intense and darker by this point. It's one of those mindfuck movies and I HEAVILY enjoy those. When I'm tripping you can imagine how cool that is. So then the story really begins to wrap itself up in a pretty intense way. Arguing, events happening on Earth and in space, it was a lot all at once. My sister started freaking out. She walked out of the theater and of course I walked out with her. Missed the ending of the movie and I will regret it to this day because she decided to just have a cigarette and call our ride...

I don't know the science of it but... Did she really freak out over having a nicotine craving?? Just a thought, I'm not a smoker but it seems logical I guess. Still a great experience that I wouldn't trade for the world and I encourage everyone to trip the fuck out and watch this on surround sound!
