 Sure, I live in London, in the UK :) 

Oh really? I do find that most AB redditors say that they normally wait around 14 days for shipping. It may be Canadian customs that are holding onto it. Did you pay for the 'K-packet' shipping? 




 I honestly didn't expect them to arrive for another 5 days at least and I'm already preparing my next wish list! I was in such a rush in getting the door one of my contacts actually popped out from rubbing my eye...(these exams, seriously)

I'll definitely let you know how I get on with them, the peeling gel is actually for my dad so we'll see how well it works for both of us (he is 50 with wrinkles and I'm 18 with hyperpigmentation). 




 I paid for the items on 18/05 and they both were shipped on 20/05 and arrived today (27/05).

I now finally know why people post their hauls, waiting 7 days for shipping feels like a year compared to domestic services! 









 Ahh!! I've never hit up their standalone stores before, I'll be sure to check them out when I'm back in town. Oh I know the Viva mall, its right opposite station!

Thanks so much, so excited to go!! 




 You don't believe me? 




 Beijing isn't so bad most of the time, although older buildings (anything but apartment complexes) always have a few lurking mozzies in my experience.
  Buy yourself an electric mosquito swatter, those things are great to wave around the place to kill any.
  Buy yoself a tonne of Tiger Balm once you arrive, they're sold at any pharmacy. Try to buy the 'Dragon and Tiger' brand and use this to rub onto any new mosquito bites. Slap that stuff on.
  I would recommend a plug in over the burner spiral type, you can find Raid ones in supermarkets always have the burner and the packs together for like 15 RMB.

DEET has been the best thing in my experience, when I stay my Grandma's place (her building was built in the 40s so its packed with mosquitoes), DEET is the only think that can protect me. Try to limit where you spray it, i.e. only on arms and legs and exposed skin. 




 That's usually the reason a Chinese gets with a non-Chinese guy. Places in Beijing like Sanlitun are now filled to the brim with girls stumbling in their heels to draw the attention of foreign guys. 




 Marriage is like some game in China right now. Elders in the family feel like after 35, the woman is a leftover. 

Seeing as there are more men to women, is it not wise to use a 'skill' of sorts to get to your ideal man and show off to their families, friends, coworkers etc.? I'm sure a lot of Chinese women have sex regularly, and have sex before marriage, but like a lot of countries in Asia, seeming 'pure' and virginal is a large attraction.

I don't think Chinese girls and women are asexual but most girls probably still associate sex as something difficult to bring up, especially with family, and school whilst there are women who also enjoy regular or casual sex. 




 Can I ask which stores in Beijing you went to? I've been to the Sasa's and Watson's around but I'm running out of other places to go to. Out of the stores I've been to, I don't think I've seen much of the Korean brands around :( 




 The MG masks are really nice and also go for around the 20 RMB mark, which is around 2 or $3.25 mark (rough guess). I've also tried Watson's own Bird's Nest sheet mask that I really like, it left my skin feeling very hydrated after the drying Beijing air (its so dry I get nosebleeds).

Most Chinese women I know use Korean brands as there are plenty of poor quality ingredients that Chinese manufacturers use, so there aren't too many high quality Chinese beauty products I'm afraid.

Shenzhen stores will probably carry lots of imported goods that you may find are cheaper and also, sometimes if you buy products as samples, they come out waaayyyyy cheaper. My aunt buys like 10 of Lancme's Toner in 30 mls and it works out to be far cheaper than the 200 ml bottle. 




 This varies from region to region, in Beijing, we have it for breakfast and its a lot thicker, consisting of tofu, mu er and huang hua and has a deep, almost smoky taste to it 




 Yeah I agree, I have also had issues with EMS abroad too, which sucks. I'm pretty sure Jolse and RRS state that they mark down the value. 




 I'm really worried about my order too, even though I didn't pay for EMS. I ordered around $90 worth plus $16 shipping on RRS so I really hope Customs won't believe that its a 'gift' and crack it open, even though I've heard RRS lowers the value of the items. It's my first AB haul too so here's hoping... 




 Hi, congrats on making the move!

I can help on a few things here for you:

2) Try to buy non-import goods from supermarkets (the prices are crazy) and try stick to local markets. Local communities tend to go to a few local shops or stalls, particularly the elders. My local shop has very fresh eggs and seasonal produce, particularly watermelon. Ensure to wash all food before consumption though and peel foods when you can, e.g. apples etc. due to the sheer amount of pesticides, fertilisers etc. 

With regards to milk, I don't know if you've heard of the many milk scandals, but my parents have told me to stick to San Yuan . As far as I know, they're the only ones without any big issues so far, but to be honest, all milk tastes bizarre to me in China so I tend to just drink Soy.

If you are around the Wang Jing area, there are many Koreans there so maybe you will get a chance to enjoy some local Korean food too.

AVOID SUPERMARKETS ON WEEKENDS ESPECIALLY SATURDAY MORNING -thats the biggest piece of advice I can give you with regards to shopping. Supermarkets often have fresh stock on Saturday and so cut prices or have deals on Saturday morning. Trust me, the price cuts are not worth the pushing, shoving, yelling, and dirty looks you will receive. Try to shop local at smaller markets (better for the economy too) for the easiest.

3) I agree with [heavy_petting], try to shop at large supermarkets for better deals, Walmart, Carrefour etc. are great for household items. I often go to Tian Yi in XiChengQu (its a large market with loads of stuff and sellers, so you can haggle for various goods from paper card to fly swatters to jewellery. I would advise against buying electricals there though, they're probably fake or will break very quickly)

4) Try to barter or haggle whenever you can, not in actual shops obviously but at places like street foods or vendors in large markets. If street food is already cheap for you or you feel generous, go ahead but for reference I normally pay ~4 for a jian bing (go try these, I crave them all the time) and if you are heading the Wang Fu Jing Xiao Chi Jie don't hesitate to haggle for a skewer. I remember when I was 16, there was an American in front of me paying 15 for a fruit skewer and I paid 4. As a British man, I assure you people will try to rip you off so don't be shy to haggle.

Also, don't be afraid to try new foods, things like chickens feet, pif trotters are delicious and have benefits for the body. Don't let the fear of food poisoning stop you from eating new foods.


As a fellow Brit, I also must plead with you not to be annoyed when people don't queue or apologise when pushing you out of the way. Don't be surprised when people race to get a seat on the subway and just stand there enjoying the air con, reminiscing the days spent on the hot stuffy Tube.

Try to dress appropriately, the weather changes a lot in August, it will be sickeningly hot and humid in August until around the 22nd then get cooler then BAM its suddenly autumn with the breeze.

Thats all I can think of for now, its time to go back to A Level revision. If you have any other things you want to ask, feel free to. 




 The weather in Beijing is hot, how hot? How humid, how much heat does the smog add?

Its hot in summer, the hot days are about to begin and will only relent at the end of August. Some days are crazy dry and some days will be disgustingly humid- beware, if you are going to the South, especially Nanjing, or places in Sichuan, you may feel like you're suffocating. Beijing gets temperamental through June to August so one day may be really dry and hot and the next can be humid and stifling.

The dry days are coming soon and can really dry your body so you may need a humidifier, I can often get nosebleeds the air is so dry. 

Please, please, please remember to wear sunscreen, preferably a sweat proof one, if you will be walking and doing 'touristy things' under the sun without sunscreen, your skin will hate you. For extra UV protection, be very Chinese and buy a UV parasol once you're there.

Any types of clothing that I should specifically not bring? Any colors that are looked down upon or just not worn?

Not really, don't wear anything crude or discriminatory and I would suggest light fabrics e.g. linen, viscose (wears a dream and will feel lush on humid days). You will be more amazed by what other Chinese people wear, I know I am fascinated by the sheer amount of incorrect grammar on most people's tshirts and items.

Enjoy your time!! 




 Go to a pharm at night and ask. I went in the morning and refused, telling me to come back at night, so I went back burning a 40 degree celcius fever and popped a few Amoxicillins they sold me.

Night time = shady time. 




 I'm Chinese and was born In Beijing but raised in London so here are some places my family and friends go to, usually for ~5-10 people, with a small summary of what I remember:


**Food**

- Cats eye pizza (various locations) -Supposedly opened by a guy who used to work at Pizza Hut then opened his own place.... But decent enough western food and very cheap, pizza is about 25-40 depending on toppings. I love their desserts and always order plenty to share.

- Gong de lin  (Qian men, Dongcheng) VEG

Personally not for me but the vegetarians in my family love it, lots of mushroom (bai ling gu ) dishes made into meat like dishes. Its usually really cramped there though but they have some signature Buddist dishes.

- Jin Si Shu Shi Fang  (Xizhimenwai, Haidian) VEG

LOVE THIS PLACE, its a tad expensive for just vegetarian dishes but they also cater for vegans. They make a really good sausage out of  as well, as well as a 'jiao liu rou pian ' out of the mushrooms too. Sadly their Dongsi branch has closed due to government demolition (perils of being in Beijing) but the Dong Zhi Men branch is just as good. I would definitely buy dinner there, vegetarians or otherwise.


- Quan ju de  various locations, Qian Men is OG)

Not Beijing if you ain't eaten their duck. 'Nuff said.

- Song he lou   (Nanlishimen, Xicheng= my ends or Zhizhuyuan, Haidian)

Excellent  song shu gui y, definitely something to photograph. Veers on expensive side but one of Ba Da Lou, so basically, a must. Very enjoyable Huai yang cai, try their meatball soup, extremely tender pork and 'melts in the mouth' as some may say. They also do a lovely Shui Jian Bao, very crispy and mince inside is well seasoned.

-  Dong Xing Lou (Tongxian, Tongzhou)

Another nice place to eat, they have quite a few sea cucumber dishes that are nice, but its a bit of a trek seeing as it's in Tongxian

-  Tong Ren Ju (Haidian) 

Open space with large upper floor. If you go, appreciate the high ceilings and the balconied corridor of the first floor rarely seen in Beijing restaurants. I had the best spring onion pancakes *of my life* (they are 'pull apart-esque'), a huge statement as I eat spring onion pancakes almost daily.

- Sizzler (various locations)

For when you're just craving a steak, took an American friend I met in Sanlitun (surprise surprise) who was craving TGI Friday's. Very basic, but good western style buffet salad bar.

STREET FOOD IN GENERAL 3

**Drinks**

Honestly, Sanlitun is for foreigners (no offense, but really, c'mon) and I have been to a fair few bars there few underage, so I really can't say I have enjoyed many bars in Sanlitun. 

Seeing as booze is so cheap in Beijing, why not just buy a bottle and stay home? If you want to go out and drink though, I think just ordering drinks with food or best of all, with small eats and KTV!!

I would recommend to stay away from the Western food though, theres nothing better than Xiao Chi in China (trust me, I used to go eat Western food a lot in Bejing and you just feel like you've missed out on a chance to try great food, especially as the Western foods aren't as authentic as the original)

Apologies for the mix of Pin Yin and Han Zi, I have being studying the whole day for the next 3 weeks of A Level exams but I really wanted to recommend some places.

Enjoy eating!! 




 Sanlitun is known for being 'foreign', full of Euro and American style bars, its fun for meeting foreigners but I wouldn't call it a Chinese experience, especially when a drink can cost the same as a food dish!

But still, define what you like as 'fun' and maybe its for you! 




 I agree with doing what makes you feel good too. However, just to let you know you may find that if you're living in a small town (Changping even has some villages) you may receive 'funny looks' when going out just because people aren't used to seeing such behaviour. Even still, if it were me, I would just do whatever hair I liked.

With regards to how people perceive you though, don't get offended if people point out you're foreign or look more foreign: I'm fully Chinese, born and originate from Beijing and I get asked by strangers if I'm mixed race due to my darker skin (compared to other, paler girls in Beijing) and lack of accent. 

Last year, I decided to get my hair digitally permed in Beijing during my summer there and it was far cheaper than in London, so if you're looking for a perm or professional dyeing, I suggest you do it in China (I'm assuming your Mandarin is good enough to communicate well with your hairstylist) and like always, bring photos to show your them what you want.   




 I have read up a lot on Vit-C as a brightener and currently have about 3/4 of a bottle of Instanatural's Vitamin C serum, which has 20% Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (the second ingredient right after deionised water).

I know that the L-AA Vit-C's must be used before any other actives, directly after cleansing, but seeing as I'm not using a L-AA, do I still need to use it before my acids? 

I've also made my first purchase from RRS today so hopefully I can get a proper routine going soon! 




 I use Piz Buin All day SPF 30, it has a pleasant scent to it, dries well and is great from sunny days to skiing, although I'm a fan of the Hawaiian Tropics Silk too
