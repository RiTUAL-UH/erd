 In the 1980's, KFC use to be good. 




 I think you are correct. Wow. 









 Wonder how much this fancy VCR was in today's dollars. Good askredditt question. I want inflation factored in.
  




 Y2k. Oh wait. That was over a decade ago.  




 You going to fix it 









 Don't need too understand the language to get the point. 









 I used a combination treatment of 400nm blue spectrum light from a hydroponic grow bulb, a topicial mixture of bezethonium cloride and epson salt, and alternation hot and cold. Each of these ideas have some known medicial benefit and are covered in peer reviewed scientific papers. My idea was to combine all three and get the 400nm blue spectrum light from a 1000 watt hydroponic grow bulb. Treated my last three MRSA infections  this way.  









 Someone should talk about the lady who helped these dogs. Bravo lady.  




 Please be civil people our furry friends would want us too be.

 




 If China can regulate population through there one child policy surely they can regulate the treatment of dogs. They lack the political will. The west should force policy change and connect trade agreements with policy change.  




 There was a scientific study that concluded that for every dollar we spent on NASA we received over 9 dollars on long term GDP growth. 




 This is a perfect example of why we need to fund large national scientific projects. This is why we need visionary leadership who understand the long term return on investment on projects like CERN.  









 They are brother/ sister. The black one is the girl and the white one is the boy. They both had worms really bad when I rescued them. After a couple of visits to the vet, they are both currently ok. 




 Who cares. They have nothing better to think about. How about thinking of ways to bringing manufacturing back. We need a visionary
President like Kennedy. 









 Brother/sister littermates  




 Enjoy the pic.  














 Interesting article but not sure this will work. 




 I want one! 









 These pics put me in a happy mood. 




 Favorite comment of the day. It paints an awful mental picture.

 Good positive story. 




 Kitty need some love.  




 Work of love. 




 Does not look good. 




 Please do and give me the results. Google 400nm light and look at the peer review research. It is called blue light therapy. It is already FDA approved for the treatment of acne. 




 I used three ideas that are known to have some useful benefit but when combine together work amazingly well for me. I am trying to get the scientific community interested in idea. Don't want any money. Jonas Salk style. 




 Yes it is a combination of three things. I invented it myself. Check out link. http://mrsafoundation.com/matthew-mcpherson/ 




 There is peer reviewed studies that say that 400nm light may help kill MRSA. I am the first person too think of using a grow bulb to produce this type of light.  Works like a charm. 




 It is a blue spectrum grow bulb when used in conjunction with bezethonium cloride treated my last three mrsa superbug infections. I am not joking. 









 Please no trolling  









 Yea and he will save 100 million in labor costs over the next 10 year from lower payed undocumented labor. 




 Good news.  




 Kefir drink 









 Super creppy. 




 True. Balance is hard in today's world. I just don't like to follow absolute advise. Life is messy but that is ok.  




 In my opinion, the body language is different in a dark triad and sometimes the eyes are a tell. 




 Dark triad personality people think normal emotionally healthy people are fools. What they don't realize is that they are the ones who are emotionally defective not humanity.  Sure the dark trial is better than average with logic but the universe is not governed solely by linear cause and effect logic. The emotion of love transcends logic.  




 But many caring genuine people are charismatic and caring. Can you tell right away or does it take time. If you can, how.
