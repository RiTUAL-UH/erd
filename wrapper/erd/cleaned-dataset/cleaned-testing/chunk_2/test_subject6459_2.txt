 The half blood prince, fantastic? I hope you're being sarcastic...

or some reason they decided to jump on that and focus more on the relationship drama and less on the actual storyline.

whelp, that might be why. The relationship drama is the storyline, even in the book. 




 This probably wouldn't be in the shulchan aruch, but is there any discussion on what a mourner who goes to two different shacharit services on the same day should do? That is the closest to this situation.

 




 You can say that as many times as you want. I have it open and don't see that. I'm in siman 55. Can you point to where it says that saying kaddish with less than 10 is assur, or where saying a d'var sh'bikdusha with less than 10 is assur?  




 You are saying it is assur, but I'm looking at the mishnah brura and it doesn't mention assur anywhere. Is it preferable to say it with a minyan? Yes. Must a minyan say it? Yes. But nowhere does it say it is assur if there is not a minyan. Again, it's great you're studying it, but I haven't, so if you could please cite your sources it would be very helpful. 

This doesn't even get into the difference of saying it to yourself versus a public declaration among less than ten. 




 Alright, I see  , but no assur. I also see no discussion on what a single person can or should do. I also see that a Katan does suffice for the tenth, unlike kedusah, meaning this is on a lower level. (Actually, I think I might have misinterpreted this--it's unclear whether these are laws for just kaddish or also brachu, kedusha, etc.) From my limited knowledge is seems totally fine to say the words of the kaddish by yourself, but it does not yotzei you.

Maybe the Aruch Hashulchan discusses it, but I can't look right now. 




 Don't worry about it. We're having an argument on the fine points of a specific law.

A minyan is ten Jewish men by Orthodox standards, ten Jewish men and women according to more liberal movements. Those of us who are more liberal/egalitarian also say there is no difference between men and women in this.

Edit: Just because the most stringently observant on here say certain things doesn't mean they are always true for everyone. :P 




 One second, the kaddish doesn't even have Hashem's name. What is the difficulty? 




 thanks. Unfortunately I only have the Mishna Brura and Rambam here.

Edit: Oh, you are referring to the mishna brura! stupid latin letters... 




 Is there a source? Also, remember the principle of teaching when saying God's name. 




 Some synagogues do sell them. If they don't, they can definitely refer you to someone else who does. 




 That's very appropriate. :) 




 It's not a mitzvah to do it, but I do not believe it is forbidden.
 




 Hmm, I thought you said Lamarckism, and Lyskenkoism seemed to be a political structure that used it as a basis. So to be clear, I'm talking about the heritability of acquired characteristics.

I'm also a layman, so I can't say very much; I'll explain it simply with more technical words in parenthesis, since I don't know your knowledge level. The basics of it that I know is that experiences (stimuli) over the course of an organism's life can change whether genes are turned on or off (expressed). Since genes are usually just codes for a cell to make proteins, expression simply means whether or not the specific proteins are made.  This is mostly caused by the way the genome is folded/held together. 

For example (and this might be relevant for people here), the gene for lactose tolerance in adults can frequently stop being expressed (i.e. the protein it codes for stops being make) if you stop drinking milk. So an adult with lactose tolerance who does not drink milk for a few months would find it difficult to start again because there are no more proteins to break it down.

The theory is that the expression of genes, in addition to the genes themselves, can also be passed down by parents. How exactly it works I'm not clear about. It's not Lamarckism in its original and expansive form, but it does share similarities. 




 Well, an altered version of it has been making a comeback recently. 




 You can also say the Mourner's Kaddish if you want -- it's a prayer in Aramaic, but most prayer books have it transliterated. You might or might not find it meaningful.  

Edit: [Here's a link](http://www.jewfaq.org/prayer/kaddish.htm) to the Hebrew, English, and transliteration. [Here is wikipedia's explanation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaddish#Mourner.27s_Kaddish).

Edit: Also forgot, is there any site or sub were I can learn more about my heritage?

That's what this sub is for! Read the wiki and people would be happy to answer your questions. I also recommend jewfaq.org

 Look up the 48, 67, and 73 wars. A ceasefire was only put into place once Israel started winning. 




 There are two different interpretations. 

'We must never again allow a genocide to happen."

Vs.

"We will never again be like sheep led to slaughter." 




 And I'm saying that this "he" refers to all of mankind. My support is that seed is always plural, and that both Adam and Eve are referred to as you when it refers to all their descendents.  




 It doesn't say anywhere that the "suffering servant" would be pierced, nor that the suffering would "bring" salvation. 




 Other biblical texts clearly identify the snake with Satan (i.e., Revelation)

Fan fiction, doesn't count.

The text specifically says that your head shall be crushed -- not a generic snake, not the snake's descendant, but that particular snake.

It also says you to Adam and Eve, and that clearly refers to them and their descendendants. Why is this different?

There seems to be a particular descendant referred to by the "seed" -- it's a singular "he" who will do the crushing, etc.

"seed" always means "descendents" in the Bible. Is there a time it is not plural that you can point out? 




 Oooo, oooo, I know this one! Hocus, pocus, [balobocopypaste](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/29dzp2/why_is_jesus_always_depicted_as_being_white/cikvnv9)!

Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.

Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.

Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here. 




 Vanilla morrowind was good for its time, but modded morrowind is amazing. This is from someone who only started playing a few months ago. 




 Has Hamas not essentially declared war on Israel? Or did they provoke Israel into declaring war on them?

Hamas' declaration of war with Israel is in its founding document. This recent violence between Israel and Hamas began with Hamas firing rockets, yes.

Either way... if one side continually declines a ceasefire, how can the other be held accountable for any casualties of war? Surely Israel would prefer to not catch any civilians in the cross fire, but if their opposition chooses to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with civilians, then what option do they have?

Good question, ask all the Hamas supporters around here.

That said, I'm disappointed in Israel's strategy; why not attempt to use Hamas' tactics against them? Spread the word that Hamas leaders/militants only intend to use your (civilians) lives as sand bags and blast shields. Consistently and constantly plea with civilians to flee. Offer salvation and safety on the border, risk Israeli lives to save those that are disenfranchised by the Hamas - let the world see Hamas firing on their own fleeing peoples... on IDF trying to help civilians leave.

They've done all of this, doesn't change a bit.

On another note, why not attempt to gas such a densely populated area, where there is no realistic escape for your enemy, with a sedative? Get in, grab civilians, capture Hamas militants. Rinse and repeat as needed. Can't we do something besides lobbing bombs at one another? Not much of a farcry from trebuchet times - where the Homo Sapien species barely understood... anything.

New headline when a 90 year old tragically dies: "Israel is gassing Gaza!"

What is Israel doing to ensure civilian's safety, aside from giving them notice that they're about to drop bombs all over their neighborhood? Is it so much to ask that the IDF stick their necks out? What if Gaza was packed with Israelis instead?

A house is typically only bombed after a call and warning "knock." The IDF *does* stick its neck out -- it doesn't have to send soldiers into Gaza, it could get everything done by air, but with severe civilian casualties. Then you would see an actual 80-90% civilian casualty rate. 




 No, no, israelnationalnews is the best website ever!!  




 The Zionists were a terrorist group to the world.

Citation needed. Zionist leaders welcomed in the US say otherwise.

The Zionists believe in one state for Israel and control of the entire holy land.

Citation needed.

After the British left the Zionists turned their focus on controlling the holy land.

No, there didn't happen to be a civil war right before they left and armies invading afterward.

They gained control by forcing native Israelites out of the land if they weren't Jewish.

Yes, yes, that's why Israel has always had a 20% Arab population, right?

The people forced out still felt a right to the land since they were on it since the ancient Hebrews.

Arabs have only been there since the 7th century; they're proud of that conquest too.

Six Day War occurred and people ignored that the new Israel state has grown past the partitioned lines it was. given.

"Occured" is such a lovely word, isn't it? Allows you to ignore why Israel conquered those territories.

The people in Gaza form Hamas in order to get the land they felt was theirs.

This ignores all history between 1967 and 2005, lucky you. 




 The battles 60+ years ago were to kick all the Jews out. Hamas is still fighting for that. 




  The grievance being that the Zionists when taking over Israel forced the native Jews and Arabs to assimilate or out of the state into Gaza and the West Bank and thus created the tensions that aren't being absolved today.

This is so incredibly simplistic to the point of being wrong, I don't even know what to say. 

I think that just because Hamas is bad doesn't make the grievance any less important.

Their grievance is that there are Jews in the area at all. If you agree with that, you are condoning them. 




 So are they fighting today's battles or the ones from 60 years ago? 




 Ah, so you agree with them? 




 You do realize that there was no siege until the rocket fire started? And that it will end once the strip is demilitarized?  




 They call all of Israel "occupied." Get your head out of your ass and realize they want to ethnically cleanse the area of all Jews.

 Probably less so than ynet and jpost, which are posted here all the time. 




 And when people ask why everyone can't just stop shooting and live together peacefully, this is the answer. 




 They didn't publish that any more than reddit publishes self posts. The guy signed up for a blog before, and spewed some racist shit on it which the editors removed and then banned him.
 




 It wasn't even an op ed, just a random blogger who they host. 




 How about the fact that they didn't publish anything anymore than reddit does? The guy signed up for a blog before, and spewed some racist shit on it which the editors removed. 




 jewfaq.org is good for reviewing things you might have forgotten, but it doesn't go in depth. 




 As long as there is a giant explosion and darkness when it hits the ground. 




 No idea. Maybe the yeshivish people here can explain it? 




 So your argument is that the method of execution (stoning) is immoral? Again, define your argument. 

Your example is like saying you forced someone into an electric chair and electrocuted them, and by the laws of Oklahoma that is ok. :P That's murder, not execution.

That's a moral execution, which isn't murder, and the bible didn't say to put the person on trial, but to just do it, so no laws broken.

Notice the example given has a trial first. The bible does say there and elsewhere that there has to be a trial before an execution.

Job is clearly an allegory, and one way of saying that we cannot necessarily find a reason for suffering. 

How much longer until you agree that stoning is a torturous way of ending the life of another person,

I disagree.

and that it wouldn't be ok for anyone to order it be done.

I agree! 
 




 Oh, not a full takeover, but a limited one just near the border. The "I keep bombing you as long as you shoot rockets" and "I will keep the blockade until you get rid of the rockets" are pretty strong cards in my opinion. 




 Nope, it was the air force, not the navy.  




 No it isn't - you don't get a free pass to kill as many human shields as you like. Proportionality still supplies. You can't kill a hundred civilians to destroy one rocket being hidden in the same building, for example.

True. Most people mistake a war's proportionality for a strike's proportionality though. I have yet to hear of one airstrike killing one hundred civilians.

Isn't that just a tu quoque?

No, since this is said to people calling for Israel to stop bombing. Why should Israel be held to a standard that no other western country is? 




 You try doing so from an airplane or drone 1000 feet up in 15 seconds using heat imaging. 




 I'm not, I'm letting you define the scenario. Who are you aiming at? 




 Right so what we should stick to Palestinian endgame of forcing all the colonists to go elsewhere and the rest of the Jews to live as second class citizens, seems fair.
 




 And if you shot at someone you would be arrested. 




 What about all the Arab states that kicked the Jews out? Should they be forced to take them back too? 




 Then yes, you are using the family who lives in that house as a willing or unwilling human shield. And who are you firing at? Soldiers of a dictator are very different than civilians of an enemy state.
 




 Israel said that it targeted a militant site, and it was thought that the kids were Hamas fighters running from the shelling.  




 Israel won't accept it though. Since Israel withdrew voluntarily and is ready to return to Gaza if need be, Israel holds most of the cards. 




 What was the other peace process in which Bill Clinton intervened?

Oh, [right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords), that [one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David_Accords). 




 The boys on the beach was a mistake, and Israel admits that. Unless it was fired knowing that they were all children, then it's not a war crime. War is brutal, and maybe Hamas shouldn't have started this one.

And none of those three schools were actually targeted. 
 




 Maybe just maybe there were actually many rockets fired from Gaza. 




 120 years' worth 




 Responsible for the action, yes. Responsible for the result? It depends. And certainly the person putting the civilians in harm's way can't be the one doing the complaining. 




 The rule 97 that I quoted from. And what is your point? Proportionality does not relate to overall casualty figures, and I would like you to prove that israel is not taking precautions in attacking. 




 You're just avoiding the question. What should Israel do in that scenario?  




 You can't blame the opposing force for killing the civilians you're hiding behind. 




 Yes, but you would usually not keep a crowd of civilians behind you while you are attacking, for two reasons.

1. You care about your people.

2. The tactic only works when the other side also cares about not killing them.

I'm not disputing hit and run tactics, but doing them next to civilians, whether they are willing or not.. 




 Um, yes it is? It might not be permanent, but it is being used for military purposes. 




 I'm pro-Israel and I mostly agree! I would like to comment on a few things though:

With that said, they have at times acted carelessly and overly aggresively. Their response of "Hamas is worse" does not suffice, because a legitiamte state should hold itself to a higher standard than an extremist group.

The response is not "Hamas is worse" but "since Hamas is using human shields, we are not at blame when those civilians die," which is true, legally, under the Geneva Conventions. You might argue about the morality, but it is not a war crime 

Also, Israel is usually saying "but America/the EU does the same/worse with lesser threats" which I have yet to see a coherent argument against.

The non-Hamas Palestinians and their more moderate leaders such as Fatah/PA are caught in the middle and the ones who deserve our sympathy

Eh, the thing is that Fatah is utterly corrupt and is just out to line their own pockets. The civilian population which does not take part in hostilities or riots is in a much worse position. 




 Then don't blame the opposing force of a massacre and genocide when your civilians die along with the freedom fighters. Usually a resistance is trying to minimize their own civilian casualties, not make more die.
 




 Then don't blame the opposing force of a massacre and genocide when your civilians die along with the freedom fighters.
 




 Yes, it is.

It can be concluded that the use of human shields requires an intentional co-location of military objectives and civilians or persons hors de combat with the specific intent of trying to prevent the targeting of those military objectives.

http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter32_rule97 




 Then don't blame the opposing force of a massacre and genocide when your civilians die along with the freedom fighters. 




 Ok, Israel lifts the blockade on Gaza and two months later there are 20 rockets every day, and several suicide bombers have gone off in towns neighboring Gaza. Now what? 




 What's your point? 




 And all the reports of them doing otherwise this time are hogwash? And that still doesn't address the fact that setting a military installation near civilians is also using human shields. 




 That is what they are doing, as per this article. My personal opinions are beside the point, I would just like to know if he would be using human shields like Hamas does. 




 If you were in Gaza now, would you hide behind ~~a mound~~ an apartment building, pick up a ~~gun~~ rocket launcher and take pot shots at Israeli ~~soldiers~~ civilians?

FTFY. 




 1. They're in danger as long as they're in Gaza, not because the firing has stopped. 

2. Other journalists are still in danger if they are caught doing similar things.

3. Hamas might take action against the news company still in Gaza or in later reporting, even if that specific journalist doesn't return. 




 Nope.

[It can be concluded that the use of human shields requires an intentional co-location of military objectives and civilians or persons hors de combat with the specific intent of trying to prevent the targeting of those military objectives.](http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter32_rule97)
 




 [Look at how many bases are not embedded in cities among civilians!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Israel_Defense_Forces_bases) 




 What would a proportionate response be, then? 




 No one sane in international politics thought it was a false flag operation; the two suspects were known members of Hamas and went missing since the day of the kidnapping. A week or so into the search, Israeli intelligence said that the suspects probably acted at their own initiative without a direct order, but that Hamas leadership did encourage their operatives to carry out more kidnappings.

Did Netanyahu use it as an excuse it to round up Hamas members in the West Bank? Absolutely, but that doesn't make it a false flag.

Hamas, if it knew that one of its leaders in the west bank was arrested, might have refused the ceasefire that Israel wanted now that the tunnels are destroyed. Israel revealed it today, after 12 hours or so of the ceasefire being in effect, because they did not think Hamas would take action now that the whole world would blame them for further escalation.  




 Israel bombing a rocket launcher near a home makes the fact that civilians died, though tragic, not a war crime unless casualties are disproportionate to the military gain 

edit: for the specific military strike, not the whole operation/war. 




 [The reaction to Israel using soldiers instead of airstrikes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2b8bd7/at_least_100_palestinians_from_a_single/) 




 A 1:1 civilian to militant casualty rate is the best in modern warfare. 




 By this logic, you are encouraging Hamas to continue these tactics since they know Israel won't fire back. In this case, what should Israel do instead? Because no population will allow its government to sit and do nothing while rockets are being shot at it. 




 Ok, that's step 3. There are three different levels here:

1. When is killing justified? Answer: War, self-defence, and execution.

2. What are valid reasons for executions?

3. What are valid methods for executions?

You have to agree to the first before we go to the other two. 

This is debate is about specifically the commandment from god to not kill, and the commandment from god to kill.

And my original comment was saying that **there is no commandment from God to not kill.** the verse says do not murder. You can argue about whether it is humane or capricious, but it is not a contradiction. Saying so only hurts your argument. 




 And this is why the Israeli censor is sometimes important. If this had come out three weeks ago instead of after the ceasefire, Hamas might have taken more drastic action. 




 They're still in danger, unfortunately. 














 You're arguing that killing during war, self-defense, and execution is morally acceptable, because god ordered it.

No, I'm arguing that these are the acceptable situations in which killing is permissible the world over and always have been. The argument over whether these laws should carry the death penalty (and why) is the second argument, but the other one has to come first. So do you accept the death penalty and other forms of killing are permissible (if not ideal), at least for this argument? 




 [But it is in line with the reporting of past conflicts.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_\(2008%E2%80%9309\)#Casualties) 




 No, it just means that Israel is better at protecting it's civilians. I would not want to see the number killed with no sirens, bomb shelters, or Iron Dome. 




 Are we arguing the death penalty now? Because that is a different subject entirely. We can do so if you want, but it's not the same argument as you had above. 




 It is an execution if the person is brought before a court of law and tried according to [procedures outlined here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_and_corporal_punishment_in_Judaism). Otherwise, it is murder. That's why the story of Jesus stopping a stoning is so nonsensical.  




 Ground invasions actually have worse civilian casualty rates than air strikes do, since artillery shelling shelling is much less accurate. What if that strike team was surrounded? Shells would fall on that entire neighborhood, killing dozens. Would you condemn Israel for that too?

And that justification is much, much better than the the justification for Hiroshima and Nagasaki: We won't be able to conquer Japan because there would be no support for mass troop deaths, so lets bomb the fucking civilians and kill thousands instead of attacking soldiers.  




 Ratzach = Murder

Harrag = kill

Executions, war, and self-defense are killing, not murder. It's the same thing today. 




 I don't care about the points, but about the post being visible. I don't complain if it's above 0. 




 Journalism before video was a thing, you know. There are still these thing called "written articles" which /r/worldnews sometimes links to. Amazing, right? 




 God never says not to kill, but not to murder. If you're going to argue this, do it correctly. 




 And this is how polytheism started! :P 




 Innocent civilians will be killed and the world will be up in arms not matter what, so let's not risk soldiers if we don't have to. 




 Allow them to take it and report on it once you leave.  




 No, the bible is infallible because words are used consistently. In this example, "face to face" is always an idiom for "directly," while "see My face" is compared to "see My back." I don't need to deal with the NT. 




 Yes, the work they do is dangerous, but they should say that Hamas is intimidating them. 




 Then they should say so instead of meekly parroting Hamas' talking points. 




 So they dutifully parrot Hamas' talking points instead. Not doing so isn't Pulitzer worthy, in normal circumstances. 

If they're scared, they should say so instead of covering it up. 




 It really shouldn't be. They were just at the right place at the right time. There should be many more of these types of reports coming out of Gaza.

Edit: really guys, downvotes? I'm not saying they need to have the balls to film it while their in Gaza, but they should at least report on it once they leave. If they are staying silent outside of Gaza for "access," then they are acquiescing to this war crime. 




 [The last Seal Team Six style operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid). And that was outside of Gaza, not surrounded by hostiles in enemy territory 




 I'm not in DebateReligion, so I'll make this quick. "Three persons, on God" is polytheism *according to Judaism*. The range of permissibility is from "complete idolatry" to "acceptable for non-Jews."
