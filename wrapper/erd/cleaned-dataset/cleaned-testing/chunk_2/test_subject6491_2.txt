You probably think thats too expensive for a book. You are correct. So did the readers in Israel. 

The retail market is dominated by two major chains (have about 80% market share together). In order to compete and sell more books, they started selling them in bundles. Prices dropped constantly, until it settled at 4 books for $30. Thats right, about  of the cover price.

At that point book writers complained that because of the power the publishers have over their contracts, they barely make any money from books sales. 

Writers are paid about 10% of the paid price. So less than $1 for a book. In a very small Hebrew reading market. A best-seller book sells for about 50K copies in 2-4 years span.

Then the government decided to intervene and save the day.
The parliament passed a law last year saying that new books cannot be sold at a discount for the first year. Thats right. The arbitrary number the published picked cannot be changed by the retail seller.

The law came into effect this February. 3 months ago. Thats it.
The situation became dire very quickly. 

Books sales drastically dropped. One of the 2 retail chains is in financial troubles, stopped paying suppliers and will probably declare bankruptcy soon. Publishers stopped signing unknown writers. New books became expensive again, publishers and stores willing to bet on well-known writers only. Some publishers stated they are on the way to close the business. Most of the books that are sold now (75%) are those published before the law took effect and can be sold at deep discount. Independent and small book stores almost dont sell any new books now.

Some customers are saying that 4 books for $30 is too cheap. They say that a book is a cultural item that shouldnt be sold in a deep discount. The say writers should be able to make a living. They got lawmakers on their side, because supporting writers is the noble thing to do.

Well, the market proved them otherwise. 
 


























































































































































 Only now I found out there are two more episodes. I'm very pleased with that too. 


























































































































































 Edit: just adding a bit of a content here, as I never meant it to be love/hate post.

I like the Heat, they are playing my kind of basketball. But I never thought of them as a *steady* team (as opposed to another favorite team of mine, the Spurs, which surprisingly, never even made it twice in a row), so I was surprised to learn that fact today.

I'm not big on basketball history before 88-89, so I can't compare this team to 82 Lakers or 84 Celtics (those are just blurred memories of NBA games I watched as a child, in which the cool kids liked the Celtics, don't ask me why).

Also, I don't think the east is particularly weak in the past 4 years compared to the past 15-20 years. In fact, it looks much stronger. But I may be wrong here.

Anyway, they still got 2 wins to go, and this stat implying it's really not that straight forward to go over this hump.
