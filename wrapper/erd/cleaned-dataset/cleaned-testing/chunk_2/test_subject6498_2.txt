 I have a feeling all the haters are jealous because they are so close with George. People often call them arrogant and stuff, which I think is misinterpretation because they do know a whole lot of stuff that we don't.

**Not to say my countryman Linda has not made some really clumsy and/or rude statements about things she shouldn't talk about in public..** When you have a whole fanbase watching, you should feel some kind of responsibility to keep moods up. Responding well to criticism is not her strongest side it seems. 




 Wow... Is that the described size? He feels a bit big.
Awesome picture tho' 




 What platform are you planning to make it for? :) Desktop or Web? 




 HBO has taken breaks with a lot of popular shows. I just wish they would do it again.
Two or three seasons of Dunk and Egg after introducing them with TreeBran would be spectacular..

They seem stubbornly firm on not taking a break though. 




 If u don't feel like read it all. Absolutely. I've done it for tyrion, Arya, and The Wall and Mereen. Only asos and forward. Though.  




 Would be possible fo'sho'. But haven't Bran thought about Meera that way before?  




 How did it go? 

I have introduced close to 10 new people, new to advanced Board Games, though they are fans of the shows and the books. 

And even though it takes several playthroughs to get a good hang off all the rules, new players seem to get a basic knowledge and after 3 or 4 rounds (if they are not afraid to ask their questions when they wonder about something). Past those rounds they can place their orders and such without any problems. 




 the largest part of tToB-cards adds no bonus/+1. There are only a few +2 and +3, and I really like that you can get fortification, sword and the skull, which can make the losing army still kill one enemy unit. 




 Actually not a very bad theory. 




 Paralyzed from the waist down means no boner and probably other problems with proreation. I believe that is a medical fact. But I would be glad with a second (qualified) opinion. 




 Not sure if you are shitting on my wall of text or if I have made your **head spin round, right round.** 




 If you are to believe to sub, I'd say if not over. Close to 9000.

Yeah BR barely counts but you are correct. Will be exciting to see if any others are secretly Targs.  There are quite a lot of those theories.  




 Not live maybe, but after warging Hodor for a year(I'm really bad at how much time is passed) he will know how to do it just as well as he knew all the stones in the walls of Winterfell. If it's possible for him to learn to slip into his skin, staying in the back not controlling him. Particularly since he will know Hodor so well. Well

**I would like to hear theories for the reasons behind Hodor being Dunk's descendant if you don't agree if only to encourage more discussion**.  George would have a good reason for such a twist. Hodor seems like a nobody, just there to help Bran North. Why would the plot need him to be related to Dunk? Someone who probably spent a lot of time with Brandon Rivers back in the days.  




 **Now, are you not prepared to read a long controversial theory.** "Leave now, and never. Come back".

Firstly. Bran and *George R R Martin* shares a huge (apperently gigantic) interest. And that is **Knights.**
http://www.georgerrmartin.com/for-fans/knights/
Also note Bran was the first point of view character George wrote. And in that chapter it was the finding of the Direwolves that came to him Martin first. Warging obviously was a huge part of the whole series from the very start.

And secondly, if you are active here you have seen this theory a couple days back. I have deleted that post, rewritten some parts, and added a whole lot of foreshadowing-material and things that **could** point the right way for this. I must say though. Ever since I first thought of this in August I am getting more convinced the more I dig, so **I need people to read what I have with an open mind and say that this is not possible.**


 nbsp;


 nbsp;

*"Ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow"*


**PREFACE**

This theory that I have polished for months **stands and falls with Hodor being the descendant of Ser Duncan the Tall**, (which I strongly believe he is, even if my own crazy Crackpot turns out false.) **And it would also suggest George's fantastic reason for him being the grandson/great grandson of one of the finest knights the realm ever saw.** Here I would also like to point out that Duncan lived almost 100 years before ASOIAF, and yet we will probably know more about him life than Ned Stark when George has finished his planned material.

I also want to say I am not suggesting different timelines here. What has happened has already happened. There won't be any paradoxes.

And I must say. If my theory is correct. George is hands down one of the most genious storytellers who ever lived. 

 nbsp;

**PROLOGUE**

To get started, here's 7 feet of tinfoil, make yourself a rugged but practical Greathelm and get in the saddle. Because we are are going on an adventure.


I think it's safe to say we are all waiting for The Winds of Winter. Before reading any further. Contemplate this for a moment. Who do you think sends the Winds, little lord?

We can all agree that tWoW will take Bran much deeper into the magical world, and I have always (even before I came up with this theory) believed that will be on such a scale the reader at this point has never witnessed or even dared to imagine. The winds he sends will be so significant they will be an entire aspect of the title of the whole book.
While the whole idea could and most likely will be complete nonsense. (one cup of self-distance every other day is healthy for your mental stability) It would be super-duper-mega-cool if this where to be proven right. So I beg of you. Bear with me for a moment.



**THE THEORY**

The magical abilities Bran possess is undoubtedly incredible. Jojen shat his pants when discovering he could take control of Hodor. Something even he had never heard was possible(?) Bran has had very little real training up to this point, and he has but gotten a few glimpses of what warging and Weirwood.net is capable of. We have seen him go far back in time, watching his father and sending him some rustling leaves, and Theon even heard him speak. I have a I think that will change. Bloodraven most certainly will teach Bran everything he knows, and I would bet he knows more than anyone (for now). How BR will show and teach Bran what he needs to know is totally unknown at this point though, and that is what my theory is all about.

I think he will take Bran back in time to when he was Brynden Rivers. He will get to study the life of a Targaryen prince. And, most importantly (for Bran and this theory anyway) is to let Bran do that from the eyes of a Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.. And what a Knight he will be/was! "Three whole pages for Ser Duncan the Tall.." The few times Dunk is mentioned in the novels they speak of him as one of the most honorable Knights who ever lived.

Towards what ultimate goal is Bloodraven doing this then? He will gain Bran's trust when fulfilling his deepest wish, he will show Bran that he is Brynden Rivers, A Targaryen bastard and not just a dude in a tree. Bran will be the one escorting Branden Rivers to the wall and he will also be at Summerhall, one of the series larger mysteries and the reveal will most likely be some sort of twist. The weirdest thing about this must be that he will fall in love with young Old Nan...

It makes me think Bran might learn to do what Hodor does when he's getting waged. crawl up in a corner where he cannot reach him. But he can vaguely feel his presence. Just controlling minor things that doesn't scare the crap out him.

Now, I have gotten the subtle impression GRRM has a secret love for foreshadowing. So here's what I can remember. Making it all fit together if you tilt your head a little to the left while squinting your eyes.

 nbsp;

**FORESHADOWING**

- "The Sworn Sword", Duncan the Tall: *"Go home! All of you! Back to your villages, and see if the fire's spared your homes and crops." "It was if some God had put the word in my mouth.* **Not the warrior.** *Was there a god of fools?"*

That bold line felt so out of context and the *"Not the Warrior"* -part was what sparked this whole theory when I read The Sworn Sword on my way to Spain for a vacation.

This happens when they are drilling the farmers, and is the most notorious foreshadowing I will present. And it is certainly not the first time Dunk has behaved impulsive. We know Bran is very kind to his smallfolk when serving as "Lord of Winterfell" And I can not see why Dunk would think about the gods in a moment like this. He is not a very pious man what I can recall.

**farfetched you say?** well this is the Hound to Arya: *"Keep your mouth shut and do as I tell you, and maybe we'll make it in time for your uncle's bloody wedding."* I try to remember that this is George, and he is the grandmaester of subtle (subtle) hints.

- **"Dunk the lunk, thick as a castle wall."** That is something he gets called, and often think about himself. We don't know really except it insultes Dunk's intelligence sounds extremely catchy. Him being a big fella makes it really fitting.

 nbsp;

**But let's take a step back.** In A Game of Thrones first chapters, a lot of focus lies on Bran's climbing the Walls of Winterfell. Of course it all leads up to the fall, but it is very explicitly describes how Bran has climbed them so often he knows every stone in Winterfell so well he could probably climb them sleeping (paraphrasing).
With the loss of his legs, he can't climb the Castle Walls anymore which he loved almost as much as his dream of being a Knight. But he get's part of his ability to move back with the help of Hodor. And even though this is a long shot. I can't see "Thick as a Castle Wall" as just a joke on his name. Not after I was taken from behind by "Not the Warrior"


- *"You will never walk again, but you will fly"* It is established in the first chapter of A Game of Thrones that this boy is dreaming of the glory and the tourneys. But it doesn't end there. I would say Bran thinks about his crushed dream of becoming a Knight more times than you could count, and I see that as a reminder that it is something he has not gotten over yet. Bloodraven quote here has the literal meaning. "You will Warg dragons". And it has the hidden meaning. That he will do more than he ever dreamed was possible.

- Bran's last chapter has some crazy visions. Ned basically confirms R+L=J, we get to see Lyanna fighting (I think?), possibly foretelling that she is tKotLT. We see a mystical pregnant woman who wants revenge. And we see The First men about to make a human sacrifice. (All these could and most likely is Bran's family and ancestors)

And then we see Old Nan kissing Dunk... (I suspect) Why is that important? Why are we shown that along with his family? What is Hodor if not just a way for Bran to get to point B? Why does BR first show him members of his family, and then a Hedge Knight secretly travelling with a prince?

- ASOIAF is pretty unique in it's point of view storytelling. And while the complete history of the Targaryens (tPaTQ and tRP) is written as an in universe history book. The Stories of Dunk and Egg is written from the perspective of Dunk.

- The first scene in The Hedge Knight. Ser Arlan is dead, leaning against a tree.
I don't see GRRM just making it so because it's cool. It must have a purpose, like everything else he writes.

**GRRM is planning 9 novellas about Dunk's life as a knight.** He released The Hedge Knight the same year as A Clash of Kings, 1998. And I can not fathom why he would begin writing a separate story at the same time. If the two stories were not heavily intertwined and important for the whole story I don't think he would have written the whole thing as a separate trilogy. (that is what Dunk and Egg will become when it's finished) Releasing it parallel with the novels could implicate it is really important to know about Dunk and what he did when you get to reading the later part of asoiaf.

**Also remember who has the first chapter, and remember GRRM's and Bran's extreme love for knights.**
http://www.georgerrmartin.com/for-fans/knights/

P.S. 
This could actually fall under the same theory as Bran in some way being Bran the Builder and/or some of the other notorious Brandons. Particulary Bran the Burner. His father went away and didn't return. His son Bran the Burner reacted pretty childish to me.. Setting all remaining ship ablaze. That sounds incredibly impulsive and something he probably regretted dearly after, just as Dunk regretted causing the trial by seven.

EPILOGUE

Now it's time for everyone to shoot my imaginative ass down (I put a lot of effort into this, so shoot me gently).
Otherwise add something. (I would like to read every Bran chapter word for word.. Got any knowledge of him wishing to be taller?) **Discussion is all we have until date unknown, and I wish to cherish that.**

**If you don't agree**
If you don't agree with this at all (say so, and then join the discussion about Hodor and Dunk.
I would like to hear other theories about what the point is of him being the descendant of possibly the most honorable knight in history and why that never being discussed! 




 How could I not make that connection... Oh well. The answer is my sigil. 




 I know that. I didn't base this on the data, I based it on my own personal experience. Someone posted it in a comment and I added it because it was a terribly relevant study that seems very well done. 




 lol. My thought exactly when reading a third of all posts. (But we are still here aren't we :D)

I will cherish the day an announcement arrive. This sub will be **on fire**, and the spirits will be as high as the wall,

(**touch wood**(more like banging my head against my coffetable)) 




 What a wingman I have. I was ready to give up that argument! 




 I agree, you shouldn't vote on every post. You should vote if you think the post should to be acknowleged. And you should vote thereafter.

It feels like people think I made this thread fishing for upvotes. I just thought it worth to point this out.
 




 Thanks! So I may be on to something here? I feel people are mostly serious on this sub (hypethreads aside) Ironically enough, this post has lost about 7 golden dragons in the last 30 minutes...

**It truly is useless to try making the world a better place.** 




 Because Baelish says "I know, I know" in a certain way. Could be nothing though, but I made the thread because there are bound to be others I have missed, and someone has certainly picked one or two up. 




 Yeah, of course I hope ^^But I am so tired of being disappointed. People must have thought he would write the next book quickly since the end of aSoS... 




 Oh, didn't think about that! Three is a good number, but it could very well be a little nod towards it! 




 If you think it is troll, absolutely. If you think he is serious, **correct him or let someone with more energy do it. Someone most likely will.** 




 I think they should add it as a possible murder-weapon in Clue. 




 Really?! Well. Yes I could very easlily see that as true. 

I first noticed how people did this after typing up my own tinfoil theory for two hours in bed on my Padphone.... I think I would have at least 30-40 less downvotes if people knew about how to use the buttons.

**And I am pretty sure I'm not the first to have typed up a long post** really putting in an effort to make it readable and easy to follow. Just to have it downvoted because people disagrees, making it slide down the pages much faster. 




 **this is exactly what I mean!**

it doesn't matter if your post is misinformed, far-fetched or dumb! As long as you make your point, don't break the rules or make a rude comment and most importantly **DON'T TROLL** people shouldn't downvote you no matter how stupid the post is. (Well.. There are exceptions confirming the rules)

**And that is what you and many others hasn't understood. 

People downvote posts because they think what the OP asks, states or thinks is misinformed and or just doesn't agree with their opinion.

And all this brings down interesting discussions.

 




 And for some time to fuel the flying flamethrowers. 




 nice one! 




 And he writes slow. 




 Great post, but thinking aDoS will be easy for him to write is pretty naive of you. **If it will truly be the last book** he will want to get everything completely perfect. That's just the way he is. We've known that for a long time.

If he isn't pleased with what he has written, he will rewrite it. And he will do it again, again, again, again, again. Then he will change it completely. 




 I don't see her having time to conquer north Essos before the series end.
I hope she unites Slavers Bay and make it Unslavers Bay. Setting in motion the abolishing of slavery in the entire world. Then leaving for the east. 




 I'd say skipping the first book is the worst book to skip! 




 A lot of cool characters are cut from the books, but I think the writers plant references and homages to characters they had to leave out. My find is the scene when Tyrion and Littlefinger are talking about rewarding Podrick Payne in S03E03

This caught my attention.

T: "did fuck her once."

B: "I know."

T: "But we don't."

B: "I know"

Baelish changed his voice in a way that made me think it was a reference to Patchface. I don't know if it is something everyone noticed but I was pretty astonished!
 




 I am still hoping Benjen will be a prologue/epilogue in a future book. 




 Ilyn Payne would indeed be really cool! Would love to know what goes on inside his head. 
Those chances are pretty slim though I suspect. 




 Hoping tWoW will shatter this with Bran! The magic is one of my favourite aspects of the universe, but maybe that is because it is so mysterious. 




 I would think others who are well versed in english history (I am not) has already made this connection, but I havn't heard about it anywhere.

It sounds to fitting to be a coincidence, particulary since I am pretty sure Richard III is an inspiration for a couple of characters in the series from what I have read elsewhere. 




 Well of course. I was of the impression that was obvious considering it's a 700-page book shown in ten hours.
But it was my mistake I wasn't clear in what I meant. 




 Well, I put it wrong. Almost every scene in the show is take directly from the book. Even the dialogues are pretty much the same.

 




 I agree. It's far more vague in the show though.
Some showwatchers who aren't as hardcore as us hasn't figured out the difference at all... 




 With the shattered sword in the prologue, I think GRRM tried his very best to make it as noticeable as possible ;) 




 When I first saw that name I thought it was a wink to Tolkien and Frodo's alias **Underhill**. That was before I knew that he reffered to Hugor of the Hill though.

Honestly, I still think it is an homage! 




 I'd say "all of this has happened before and all of this will happen again" is already happening. More or less? 




 And I know the reason why that is.

**Upvotes/Downvotes are NOT Reddit's version of Facebook's "like button" (Or the much wanted dislike-button).**

(**Yes, I realize this post could be subject of extreme irony**.)

I think people on this subreddit misuse the downvotes incredibly often. People put a lot of effort in putting out theories, asking good questions and starting discussions about this and that, only to have the posts downvoted to the bottom by people who just doesn't agree.

**And I think that hurts this sub a whole lot!**


So, I provided the rules (not more like guidelines. actual rules) for votes. Which actually are pretty hard to find if you are not an experienced redditor.


- **Please don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.** Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, **rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.**

- Please don't Mass downvote someone else's posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts.

- Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it. Don't upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster's username is familiar to you. Make your vote based on the content.

**FAQ**
 
##24. Someone made a mistake in their post or comment! **Did they even read the book? Should I downvote them?**
No. If you can do it nicely, feel free to correct them and move on. If you cant do it nicely, just move on.


**To my astonishment** jsdistasio **pointed out that this sub is one of the most downvoting on Reddit as a research done about a year ago points out.**

http://blog.getredditalerts.com/reddit-sentiment-analysis/  




 I'd say all of essos payed up together, hiring the FM to make it go kaboom. 




 Warg Bran teached him / Was Brandon the Builder all along. 




 Missing the House of the Undying, "promise me Ned", book Stannis and Patchface? Shame on you :) 




 First book is almost scene by scene. By the third book most things are changed, although they mostly arrive at the same point.

I know you are tempted to skip forward. Some of my friends have, and they have missed so much **You must bring yourself to read the books** though. You need to learn what Daenerys is thinking. Emilia Clarke doesn't portray her character as well as I wish she would.
And Ned's chapters are gold. Just pure gold!

And of course what everyone already mentioned. All the prophecies, foreshadowing and backstory.
First and second book as a lot of those. Particulary House of the Undying is very different from the show. 




 If they are talking about dead men, it's a **wight.**

And every time **Others** enter the stage, everything freezes to ice unnaturally fast. And when they are spotted, the POV-character pretty much shit their pants.* 




 I would say it's slower. But I prefer listening sometimes. Awesome while driving, making the dishes or cleaning the apartment.

**Some people doesn't like Roy Dotrice as a reader though. But I quite love him!**

I would say it is not the best way to consume the series if you are interested in theories and such. You miss hidden details whie listening and can't stay and go back a line to analyze. 




 Quite possible. Had not heard that before. A little like how the peace with Dorne was brokered? 




 Dragons  




 Holy shit. Didn't he burn the ships because his father died or something?! 
Burning your whole fleet seems just as impulsive as punching a prince in the face. 
Would a grown man really do these things?  




 This is certanly new, but I would think there would be at least small foreshadowings and/or hints towards it. I am a bit of a theorizzeeer myself though, so I don't blame you for letting your imagination run wild!

I don't see George introducing people aging backwards more than halfway into the series. That would be super weird. 




 There are probably a lot of huge fans out there who read the books but hasn't experienced the greatness of **The Tales of Dunk and Egg.**

I want to take this moment to fully acknowledge the fantastic quality of the three published novellas and I urge fans who have not read them to do so.

It is a much softer read than the novels and I would say the quality of the stories are spectacular. You really sympathize with Duncan, and I would say they are mostly pretty feel-good. Something that is rare in this universe we all adore so much.

No one of my friends who are fans have read The Tales of Dunk and Egg yet (despite my warm recommendations), and 
I suspect because it is because they have no idea who those characters are (only being mentioned a couple of times in the novels).

**Do yourself a favor and read them. You won't regret it.** 




 Read Dunk and Egg asap. They are weirdly by-looked. 




 Yes. Mace Tyrell is not fool, as the show want's us to believe. And I think their words are really fitting. They are ambitious as hell. Probably more so than the Freys. But they have patience. 




 He was called that because he was the last Dayne King.

It's like "The King Who Knelt" 




 Healthy perspective. 




 Isn't passionate about them? I'd say he is incredibly passionate about promoting new writers in Sci-Fi and Fantasy so editing collections and anthologies seems to really be his thing. And he totally loves Wild Cards what I understand. 




 I'd say the Manderly's have more money than the Starks. But that's just a wild guess. 




 What has happen has already happend. Timelines would ruin everything and will not happen at all. 




 I'll take it! 




 Really!? Didn't notice that one! Anyone wants to find the paragraph? I don't have the book with me home over christmas (It's actually already released as a bound book in Sweden) :) 




 That would make me happy, and sad.  




 You make me feel so shiny!  




 Really?....  




 That's how a season begins though right? :)  




 Read Bran's last chapter when I sees Winterfell. He sees Eddard and it practically confirms Jon Snow to be the dude we all know. 
It's regarded as a fact for a reason 




 No. It doesn't spoil the events it's spoils the history. 

**I'd say reading it as a watcher-only would enhance your view on the entire saga.** It's such a vast world.  




 Stop. I don't want to think about this.. 
II'd like to think the ask George stuff, but mostly I think they are going on it alone. D D knows the rough outline, and considering many of the deviations in S4 I'd say they are doing their thing to get to the end In a way possible for them. 




 Oh yes! Ser Duncan the **Tall** probably the furthest you could come from a cripple, simple minded. Possibly Hodor's great-grandfather or something, making it more (somewhat more) believable for Bran to be able "warg" a person from history. 

We also know he has interactions with BR. 
More crackpot is that it may be revealed in the next book, and that's why Dunk and Egg 4 was postponed and replaced with The Princess and the Queen. Supposedly the next Dunk and Egg will take place in Winterfell/The North  




 So you have reached denial huh?  




 If you read twoiaf you will appreciate the books history references so much more!  




 It is known.  




 Dany says fuck Westeros, I will stay in essos and banish slavery everywhere.  




 Varys. Oh, and Hodor.  




 'cus she wanted to get rid of that bun in her oven before telling?  




 My own precious tinfoil theory spins on your comment a bit. 

It has been stated several, several times Bran wants to be a Knight. And I think Bloodraven will let him be one in the past as a lesson in treestuff. 

My theory actually has one line that vaguely hints at this being true. 
**Please, ask me who the Knight is. Please. Please.** 




 Since Christmas origins from the pagan holiday occurring when the days begin to grow longer again, I would think it unlikely, since there is no way to predict when that is going to be in Westeros.  




 To ensure he would not incite a civil war, he made it doubly impossible for him to take the crown. Probably even more honorable than Ned now that I think of it.  




 Well, Homo Sapiens used to screw the neanderthal, but that was also a long time ago...  




 This here is a perfect example to show you that you shouldn't listen to everything that people posts about this series. No matter how well read they may seem.  




 Brandon the Builder, AKA GRRM's cheap way of explaining why Starks have no naval power. 




 As the gate is on my doorstep, I send 1000 men to strengthen Vale's defences. 




 Your Grace.  









 You have 1000 men from Strongsong my liege. 




 I will send 1000 men from Strongsong to accompany you. 




 There should be a max amount of tradeagreements simultaneously. And there should be resources. Stone, Steel, Grains, Fish, Wood and Gold?
6-10 resources should be enough? Cattle and horses? 




 If this should lead to aggressive negotiations, the Cinder's would be glad to lead the vanguard of the Vale to victory. I am certain the north pretenders will bend the knee to the Starks though. 




 I greet you my lord. Know that the men and women Strongsong stand behind you. 




 The Cinder's of Strongsong stands behind Lord Sheridan of the Vale. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell, and the Starks has ruled the North since before the Andals arrived. 




 [OOC] I am a first time player as well, and has taken a holdfast in the Vale, playing as a "new" family.  




 The Vale will prevail. 




 We have united the clansmen the in the valley of The Vale, what dangers may lie east of the mountains is unsure. A small escort of a dozen knights and squires may seem appropriate for seeing lady Baratheon safely though the east. 




 Lord Royce, we share the same ancestors in the first lords of The Vale, and we salut you as family. 
 




 too soon. 




 I will try this out. Hope fore some good developments in a week or so ;) 




 With the growing tension in the realm and concidering the incident at Duskendale 276AC. I Lord Burk Cinder of House Cinder wishes to swear fealty to you, Lord Sheridan. The new Lord of the Vale.
My ancestors have lived in these mountains since the Dawn Age. And we wish you to consider us some of your most loyal bannermen, 
The King has not been seen leaving the Red Keep for 4 years. Stange tales are being told about his mental health. We must stand together to face the times to come. 

**The Vale must prevail!** 




 A rugged, very tall knight from across the table gave him a clout on the ear. And Bern dared not look up to the hosting families. Ever Again. 




 Some southern jester with colorful clothes. 




 Well Lord Cinder has been mindin' his own business, pinching his wife in the ass and laughing at the drunk fool at the head at the table. T'was the eldest son of Lord Cinder who laid eyes upon the fair Lady Lorella. Noone except Lady Lorella notced the incident and therefore no one could blame him for it. 

Or call them Japes or a sign of disrespect of any kind.
