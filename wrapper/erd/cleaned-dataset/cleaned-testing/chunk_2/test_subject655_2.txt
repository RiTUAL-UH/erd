I really appreciate you saying this and hope more people read it.   We've got people (mostly young men) showing up to live in washington.   They don't get that it's supposed to be laid back and chill.   

Great... you wanna partake in the legal weed I'm fine with that... but you don't need to stand out on the fucking sidewalk with a 6 foot triple matrix bong and blasting bob marley at 9 am.   

I get it...you're stoked to be here.  But can't you just like roll a spliff and chill on your porch or whatever?

 1. Did you even read the 2nd amendment.  It clearly says "in a well regulated militia"

2. To be fair, internet, modern postal service, and the likes aren't really able to be used to deprive people of life.  

3. Yes... they wrote it exactly for that, I already said that more than once. except most of the threats at the time were bands of indians, and military units (both rogue units and enemy units). 

 




 Why?  Each amendment stands alone.   The wording of any other amendment has no bearing on the 2nd amendment.    

It clearly says "well regulated militia"   

That does [not] mean to our forefathers that people need assault rifles with shitloads of rounds in them.   There was no such thing as a machine gun when it was originally written.   To them. a firearm was slow... heavy... and not very deadly in a singular form.  It wasn't until entire miitary units, firing muskets together as one, that they became effective in bringing death.  

So you have to think... they didn't write the amendment with the idea in mind that one weapon in the future could kill far more people than 50 men firing muskets could.  They wrote it with the idea that communities could defend themselves without waiting for a military unit that could be weeks away (or never coming).  The idea was that public communities would own and regulate the weapons use... rather than allowing single individuals to build stockpiles of powerful weapons that were in no way managed by anyone other than that individual.   The forefathers were VERY MUCH about preventing any ONE MAN from holding too much power, but that MANY MEN TOGETHER (the people or the public) would hold the power.      




 The locked down devices prevent you from continuing to use your device on a new carrier.  So even once your agreement is done, the carrier still controls your phone.  So you paid money for something you don't fully own.  If you bought the non carrier unlocked model...you could still enjoy your device.   Many of the non carrier models have a wider range of bands they can use as well.    




 Triple shot u pussy.  And it has to be shaped like a boot for no fucking reason at all. 




 yeah but spread out over 30 sec 




 I always thought the 2nd amendment wording was strange.   To me it reads not as a right for every man to have a gun, but was the right for a civilian population to organize into a well regulated militia and stockpile arms for that militia.   

The supreme court had other ideas I guess.  

Edit: I'm not saying the supreme court is wrong in their interpretation.  I just think the original wording indicated a little bit more organization to owning weapons than simply straight up no checks or balance of power between individuals.    I don't think they wanted the GUNS GUNS GUNS dystopia the NRA (and their arms dealers support) would prefer having.    I say this as both a gun owner and member of the NRA. (which was a very different NRA when I joined) 




 Well it's too late for that now.  For all we know the manager could have been in on it... no matter what their gender is.   

Regardless, the store is in control of content which could be a legal liability for them.   So why not just delete it?  No proof anymore.  You can't sue when the police arrive and find zero evidence to your claims.  


Don't be a weak little shit.  When somone does this shit.  You go outside call the police and wait for them to arrive.  Don't challenge the violator because they'll just delete the pics.   YOu want evidence.        




 Why would you have NOT called the police immediately????  Way to go.  You're exactly the kind of victim he was looking for.  

Now it's a LOT harder for them to actually do anything about it.  Especially now that his manager gives him the heads up to delete it so that the store isn't liable.

 You don't buy the carrier phone.   You buy the unlocked models sold by third parties or Samsung itself.  

There is no bloatware on these devices.   




 The fact that it was a problem in the past makes the problems you illustrated more able to stand unresisted.   


SO I get a little miffed when I see people saying "This has been happening for a while" as if its just some small standard annoyance to our civilization.  When it should be MORE ALARMING that it's been going on for so long.   




 You're not buying a 2 year agreement when you buy a non carrier phone.   

And you don't have bloatware.  

You know why bloatware companies pay to reduce the cost of the phone?   It doesn't matter if you don't use their software.  They still make profit off the data the software on the phone is allowed to acccess.  

So no...it's not FREE.  They FORCE you to give them something.   And you don't even get a device you fully control in exchange or the freedom to change carriers with that phone once you're agreement is done.   So you don't own it.... you paid verizon to own your phone for you and tell you what you can and cannot do with it. And in this case... the carriers are telling people that their devices must not be secure. 

That's a big fucking expensive problem.


The money you save from not being locked into a contract alone is enough to cover the subsidized nonsense.   Before I quit that I couldn't get new phones.  Now, I pay my full price phones down in 6 to 8 months (sometimes less) and get an upgrade.   And my monthly bills for phone service have been about half on account of the buying power I gained from freedom.

 I'm in Southern Leyte Philippines.  Woman comes to me asking what she should do.  Woman is in her mid 50's and obese 

The wound was full of green and yellow puss before I washed it out with a bottle of saline from a first aid field kit.  

It took a good hour and half to get all the crap out of it.  I expected it to look a lot worse before I began cleaning the gunk off but here it is clean: 
http://i.imgur.com/fUN36HG.jpg

She says the wound is from Cellulosis.  She had this hole in her back for 4 or 5 weeks before visiting a doctor; who upon seeing the injury administered to her a pneumococcal vaccination as treatment.  Seems odd to me but I'm no doc so...  

(In a seperate case, this doctor gave a diagnosis of "weak lungs" to a 5 year old boy and placed him on anti-tuberculosis medication.  The boy was not recovering and during a visit to the emergency room was diagnosed and treated for pneumonia.  He recovered quickly at that point)

Back to the woman... After her vaccination she then came down with high fever and was generally unwell but managed to recover after 2 weeks of illness before coming to me.   

This is the wound now at 7 weeks old.   Is this something that needs to be stitched closed?  Do I need to transport her 8 hours away to the big hospital?  I don't really know what I'm doing... or how to bandage anything properly.  I just made a flat square of guaze and tape to keep it covered.  But I'm afraid the guaze will stick inside... eek.   

This is why I work Logistics.   




 That's the best entourage money can buy!  It's like they are all panting and following him around, just waiting for him to poop out another little golden dingle berry, so they can all dive for it at once.

 Hello World.  

There I did it in notepad.   It works.   




 Zzzzzzz 




 You misunderstood.  The wave is not pushing it back and forth.   The point of convergence between the two interstellar medium and solar wind is what changes; moving past voyager while voyager maintains is heading.  

This turbulent nature of the convergence of the two mediums is the most commonly expressed reason here.     


THe water and air simulation is just to visually represent the fluid dynamics that happens at the convergence point where the two separate mediums collide.    What the simulation shows is that the border between the two is turbulent and not just some instant border change. 

THAT'S IT.  It never LEFT as the media expressed it.  It just explains WHY the readings are occurring(and being misreported) while it passes through the convergence point.   

If you're going to refute a point, try not to change it entirely from what it is first.  Trying to act like I was saying it pushes voyager back and forth.... LOL   Never once did I say it was exiting and re-entering.  I only referred to its time spent in the turbulent convergence zone of the two mediums.

 He really is right.  I remember being young and having the perception of a song that I had been listening to on my walkman... and then have my view totally changed after having seen the video.   

Then, whenever I heard the song, the imagery was just echos of the video.   

Really kinda takes the magic away.

 True.  But the LOSS occurs from being locked into 2 year agreements and not being able to shift carriers as desired to take advantage of promotions.  

Also, the alternatives to subsidized (like edge) come with a huge hidden interest cost where the user pays MORE for the phone than it's regular cost than they would if they just utilized the interest rate on a credit card.   (not to mention the payment flexibility)

And then there is the added loss of dealing with problems caused by purchasing a locked down device that has bloatware on it and you're stuck with a broken device.  Sometimes the bloatware causes such huge problems with battery life the phone has to be replaced.   Again... time lost and time is money.  

If you are unable to afford a phone without selling your soul to a phone company for 2 years (or paying HUGE early upgrade fees) then you should not be purchasing a premium phone.   

The subsidized phones do two things.  Make 3rd parties free money and imprison customers to their carrier.   That's it.  (3 things if you count not being able to be fixed at home) 

Its much cheaper to buy it through credit card.  *And also many non carrier phone dealers will have payment plans on premium unlocked phones.*  Many of these dealers will forgive credit problems with a small downpayment.  Also, waiting to buy 4 or 5 months after release is a good way to get refurbished phones that are in brand new condition for a fraction of the cost.   




 If he checked and confirmed he should have broken up right then.  


There is no excuse to ever intrude upon a persons private space and snoop through their things unless their VERY LIFE is in danger.  

If it ended up she was completely innocent, then he is just some crazy snooper stalker guy.   How creepy is that?    




 What?  

Its wrong in showing how fluid dynamics work in a turbulent shockwave?  Uhhh no.  It was something shown at a Nye and Tyson talk to kids to get them to understand about theories behind how the shockwave works.   The water represents the interstellar medium of space.  The air blowing outwards represents the solar wind pushing it back.   

Is it EXACTLY what happens?   NO..... duh.   but it is good at showing some of the laws behind how it works.    

Next time don't just say "you're wrong" and walk out.  WTF is that????  




 The article was quoting a forensics investigator who stated that this was about how long it took for them to develop the exploits.    Which is true about... We see the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 being revealed today a huge exploit allowing remote access to data even if it is encrypted.  That phone is about 9 months old. 

No security is perfect.

[Source](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/03/25/291925559/your-smartphone-is-a-crucial-police-tool-if-they-can-crack-it)    

there was a longer article I am having a bit of trouble finding.  It appears some debates got out of hand and deleted.    




 Why would it change.  I stopped doing the subsidized thing with phones 2 years ago after reading a similar post.    

I SAVED MONEY.   That means i've been able to upgrade more often whilst my income actually went down.    




 Good to know.  Thanks! 




 Why would that be the answer?   

The answer should be to find out if she is cheating using less intrusive means.  It's not hard to figure out someone is cheating.  It's as simple as "i have to work today" when you really dont.   

The ends do not justify the means even if the ends justify an action be taken.   Two wrongs don't make a right.  Neither person here had any respect for the other.  So fucking break up and hopefully they'll both learn not to be dickheads in the future.   




 You can tell it's a frat samurai on account of the salmon colored armor.    




 Elsewhere in this subreddit is a whole discussion w/sources where they say they can.   

The police can just hook a device up to phones older than 8 or 12 months and unlock them because most have exploits by that age.  

The only ones they have to send to apple are new ones of which they get partial data from.  after about 8 or 9 months, exploits are developed and the police update their little tool. 


They don't need shit to get you data.  So it doesn't matter if you do fingerprint or iris or pin code... or what your legal protections are for them physically forcing you to unlock the phone.... it.... doesn't....matter.   They have your data if they want it.   




 People STOP BUYING SUBSIDIZED PHONES!   

All you get is a 2 year pain in the ass agreement that you can never be free from if you want to afford the upgrade.  

just buy the unlocked version on a credit card and pay it down in 4 months.   If you STILL can't afford it, then you should be doing something with your money other than buying a premium phone.  

There's a lot of places selling unlocked devices that offer financing too.    




 its because of the code it changes within the system processes or configuration files to allow itself.  Even if you remove the app, the separate code is there there able to be accessed.  

Now if the carriers didn't lock people's bootloaders down, everyone would have had a custom recovery installed and flashed a clean rom by now.  But once again all this hold handing the carriers do to "protect users" has actually put them at greater risk.   

And because the carriers have a real dick up their ass about letting manufacturers keep their devices up to date, a patch to fix it is just kicking it on the shelf at samsung.  Meanwhile the carrier just lets all their users phones shit the bed.   

We need the FTC to step in and say enough is enough.  Get the carrier out of the way.  All it needs to do is connect my call.  There is NOTHING about the software on the phone that will fuck that up.  The ONLY approval they should have over updates is when the update is to the radio.  But what's funny is, they don't even need to do that because unlocked users flash those all the time with no problems.  

There has not been a single case of modified phone software harming the network.  On the other hand, there seems be a shitload of locked down phones harming users going on.    




 You're on the exynos though... the article only lists the American carrier models as the ones at risk.  The international carrier free phones did not come with swiftkey.  Only samsung and google. (my 910c only came w/samsung)  swiftkey is different.  Swiftkey made a special bloatware version specifically for carrier model samsung phones.   This bloatware ended up being a bloated sack of ever expanding shitdemon. 

People, If you're on a carrier phone, and you were required to get it contracted to afford it... STOP DOING THAT!  Buy the unlocked versions only. Better to put it on a credit card and pay it down over 3 or 4 months than to get locked into a 2 year aggreement and no control over your own shit.    Don't let the carriers do this shit anymore.  People don't want bloatware for a good fucking reason and this is the biggest fucking one.    




 Accident warranty only covers it if you haven't voided your warranty, you are correct.  

People should just save that money and spend it on insurance instead.  ESPECIALLY if you root or play with bootloaders; you should have the 3rd party insurance.  its only 99 bucks to replace it if you brick it.   




 To be fair, it wasn't TRYING to kill humans.   It was just trying to fuck one of them.  Then it succeeded by using a bald lady to fuck Fred Jones.

 A good representation would be to take bowl of water and a straw.  Blow straight down softly until an indentation appears and grows slightly.   

If you observe the edges of this indentation expanded and shrink rapidly.  

The edge of the termination shock is sort of doing the same thing... which is where voyager is. It's not leaving just returning readings of the turbulent convergence point of the two medium of interstellar space and solar wind.     

It is caught in the turbulence of the edge.   

Edit: clarifications. 




 away from it.  




 No, you dote, Voyager is in the Gamma Quadrant.  Broccoli hasn't rescued them yet! 



 




 No.  

Because the people who can figure out how to do it will go to XDA or Rootzwiki and follow information that already exists.  

If you do it here, every derp in the world will try it, then fail... only furthering the cause the carriers have to continue locking this stuff down.

 Thus enters the Patriot Act and all that secret court shit. 

Apple cannot unencrypt the system portion of the device.  That requires your password as the key.   

The rest is not encrypted in the same manner and for whatever reasons likely to remain secret, Apple is able to respond to these warrants with retrieval of partial data.  

All these companies were required to keep backdoors in shit because of the Patriot Act.

 WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHERE YOU BUY UNDERWEAR?! WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?! UNDERWEAR IS UNDERWEAR! IT IS UNDERWEAR WHEREVER YOU BUY IT! IN CINCINNATI OR WHEREVER!! 




 If it is encrypted, they can get it unencrypted by apple with a warrant.   They don't get 100 percent of data but they get anything that is important.  TXT messages, phone records, contacts, and media files.   

They cannot get into the system of the phone though.   So they "don't get 100 percent"  




 The ends do not justify the means.

 This is why you **ALWAYS smell the wine before tasting it.**

 Staying together and making it work does not equal total trust again.  

No matter how long it's been.... it'll always be there.  In the back of your mind.    You can't unlearn it.   

You could spend 40 years afterwards in a completely blissful marriage.  And if the cheater were to go alone into a room with another female... or drive with one in his car... Or on his walk you see him wave hello to the lady down the street and she returns his greeting with a big sloppy tongue kiss....   you'd wonder.  and if you say you wouldn't you're a damn liar or a fool.   


Edit: All kidding aside. you'd still wonder even if all the actions were innocent.  You'd still wonder if you need to wonder.  Past experience guides future behavior.  You really don't just undo betrayal.    
 




 Even if they aren't cheating; once you stoop to secretly checking the other persons private things, the trust can never come back.   Snooping email, text messages, looking through their files, and combing through their internet history is wrong.  Don't do it.      

They could be completely innocent, and you're snooping through their things.   The relationship is over at that point because the communication is not there.  Neither is the respect.

 Uh yes he was.  He created a whole type of warfare called ["hard war"](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/rethinking-shermans-march/?_r=0) that involved starving civilians to death and shelling innocent towns.  

He stripped the civilian population of food on his march... even though he had more food than his soldiers could consume.  They'd take it anyway.   

The only people he did not kill were the one's that got out of his way and allowed him to brutalize others.  If you resisted at all, say to protect your last remaining cow, you and your whole family were dead.  

So it's often said "Sherman's March did not include mass killings"   That's true.  Instead, they were precision targeted killings.  Personal vendetta killings.  A die in a fire killings.   Killings of the most desperate who's backs were against the wall.

Ultimately, [his idea of war](http://www.historynet.com/general-william-tecumseh-sherman) was to make innocent civilians suffer as much as possible before they died.  

Also, Sherman seeded the term, "The only good indian is a dead indian" as a shortened version of his original words ""The only good Indians I ever saw were dead."   

So yeah... he loved killing.  And he loved it to be close and personal.   [And he loved inflicting as much hardship and pain as possible before doing so. Because his desire was to "make them howl."](http://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/shermans-march)

 Or like mixing abilities.  Of course you'll always have your pure builds.  But this everyone the same shit is stupid.  

And stop making encounters so that you HAVE TO have a specific class/build there.   The encounters should be dynamic to provide a challenge and an incentive to keep basic needs covered.... but let people get creative.  You might see some amazing shit happen during a boss fight then.  Instead of every single encounter being exactly the same, you're gonna have encounters change and evolve somewhat each time.
