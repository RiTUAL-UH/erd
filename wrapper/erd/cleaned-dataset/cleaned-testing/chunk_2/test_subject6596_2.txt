 All of them are our heroes and Simo is also one of the greatest. But there is still so many forgetten hero who was even greater. 




 Well I know Simo Hyh... I am finnish after all. But if you compare the balls you need to take alone 10tanks with birch logs versus shooting people from the distance I think it is over hype. Simo wasnt even awarded with war award (mannerheimin ristinritari) even it was proposed. The award is given to those who show enormous courage in battle. There was multiple fins with no single media attentation who fough with ten times bigger balls than hyh. Specially those in command/guerilla troops (kaukopartio) who fought behind enemy lines. They splitted russians troops on road with machine gun and when russians were in small groups they took them one by one. Kaukopartio troops were also the reason fins had more guns/ammunations/tanks in the end of war than in the begin. 




 I think white dead is kinda over hype. There is actually multiple awarded veteran (mannehriemin ristinritari) who stopped tanks with birch logs. Some of them actually stopped almost 10 tanks in one battle. Some of them even went top of tank and knocked the hatch and said "death is knocking". 




 It was so cold that if you got wound your blood circulation stopped almost instantly and you died standing. There is also legend that some fin patrol cut the russian patrol throats open with knifes and the whole rus patrol was standing on road throats open. 




 Well just look the russian comments.. 




 Well you are not obviously on map with politics or just naive. 




 Maybe you havent understood this joke then? It it joke about russians being "puppet" aka dolls. Jokes can be disrespectful too, how many n**** you know? And btw I am not even Russian myself. It is not about "dolls", it is political joke. 




 I think this post is hateful and disrespectful, but it also shows you dont know russians. You think socialism grew out of hate towards others? No, It grew out of idea people being equal. Yeah, It didint work out in real life, but at least they tried.

I think capitalism isnt good either, but it is the best we got now. It makes people work and world going on. We just need to hold in it as long as we get something better. Maybe it is socialism where robots are working for us, but let capitalism be our vehicle in that bright future. 




 Who said we download? we make. 




 All this free space for more porn. 




 Before I buy anything I try to justify it first. My whole property is pretty much: phone, laptop, desktop, cloths, desk and bed. 




 Is that BACON? :OO 




 Aika ptevn olonen kaveri kun miettii et toi on sen eka video. Vois olla oikeesti sen olonen kaveri mink videoita vois oikeesti alkaa katsomaan. 




 I definetly undestand javascript in browser side, but node.js? Really? Personally I go for anything else. Because having setup that encourages you to make errors you certainly will. Then there is those design patterns that try to fix javascript flaws but usually ends up making debugging hell. I personally love strongly typed, compiled, consistence and pure languages like haskell. Because it will protect me from making mistakes. 




 Your periods are already in sync? 




 Lack of consistence and some designs decisions are really bad and with unexperienced programmer you usually end up with horrible mess. It is also sad to see javascript being so popular with beginners.

 +1 AQ40 boss

 Wow, such handsome fellow redditor.

You got some specific gtk theme installed? firefox looks neat. 




 Tss on tllnen hieman homostava mieheks metsstj joka metsst "raakaa lihaa", joka sattuu olemaan "lauma urosturisteja". Lisksi on tamperelaisia "urosturisteja" jotka ovat kyrsn pern. Lisksi videolla naapuri jahtaaja joka on kanssa "urosturistin" pern.

Edit: Niin ja unohtui tm ett urosturistin kanssa piti kyttyt "miehekkmmpin ja isommin". 




 Kuten youtube kommenteissakin lukee: onhan tm vhn homoa. Homosaatio on siis tullut mys hmeenkyrn. 




 Sailaksen kirjoitus oli vhn hassu siin mieless ett hiriveesti kritisoi sit ett ei mitn tehd, mutta ei kuitenkaan itse kerro sitten mit pitisi tehd. Tavallaan todisti oman ajattelunsa todeksi tekemll paskan kirjoituksen. 




 HEY GUYS! There is football dude in hockey thread! 




 ebola mentioned better to go bat shit crazy! never mind i am not murican 




 Tst tulee aina talvisota elokuvat mieleen. Talvisota elokuvista tulee taas mieleen kuinka uskovaiset tulivat myymn lastenkirjoja. He luovuttivat siin vaiheessa kun nkivt minut sohvan takana, kypr pss ja rynkky kdess huutamassa ett KUOLE RYSS! Oli muuten UN kypr :P 




 Kyllhn sen ny nkee tosta jtkst ett se on jonkin sortin kommunisti. Ei yhtn osaa arvostaa itsenisyytt. Lienekk edes armeijaa kynyt. 




 No excuse, I am already happy the way I am. 




 Kyl ne hommat on ulkoistettu aikoi sit. 




 Niiss ei pahemmin tarvi yhdyssanoi ;D 




 No se idinkieli on osa sit viestintkokonaisuutta, samalla tapaa kuin pakkoruotsi. Minhn en siis tee milln tapaa minknlaista viestint, lhinn ptn teknologia asioista. 




 Mynnetn viestintopinnot ei ehk mennyt ihan nappiin, mutta kuka nyt olisi tydellinen? ja sit varten on sihteerit. 




 Itse olen kyhn vasemmisto perheen lapsi, jonka iti kuoli yliannostukseen. Ei olisi mitenkn mahdollista ett seisoisin tss ja nyt korkeasti koulutettuna ja johtavassa asemassa ilman ett yhteiskunta olisi tukenut minua.

Se ett miss muodossa yhteiskunnan tuki tulee ei ole mitn merkityst, koska hyvinvointi yhteiskunnassa se tulee joka tapauksessa. Yhteiskunnalla on taas merkityst sill kuinka paljon tuon tuen maksamisen maksaa. Ja mit vhemmn tuo tuki maksaa sit enemmn tukia ja palveluita voidaan jrjest.

Ihan vaan kommari vihaajille, minulla on kokoomuksen jsenkirja. 




 Arch? if you want to be cool install gentoo. Even those Arch dudes dont have balls to install it. 




 Thanks! 




 More like.. "I saw your grandma last night" 




 That sounds cool. Is there actually some magic or does it just run some 3rd program? Can you share the script? and also that python screenshot one? :) 




 I like it, but somehow that sperm behind girl is kinda distracting. 




 I can definetly agree with this.
One good way to reply is to be really polite.
Like example if somebody tells you to be "retroactively aborted", you just thanks and you tell you will talk about it with doctor. 




 You can actually find similar behaviour from multiple lower class workplace. It is pretty common that in building site somebody is called with names. It is not like it is mean to be anyway personal. Those who take it personal should grow some balls, get over it and do better work next time. 




 This is also culture thing. In Finland we dont have concept of small talk. Also we dont really like to talk much and when we talk we usually like to talk straight and only "facts". That is just way we roll. Linus also talked about "you need to earn respect" which is also quite true in here. 




 I wonder where the fuck you work when it is allowed to watch butt pics. 




 I try to make favour and get this pic NSFW tagged, because if i see this pervert way, I am sure there is boss who sees it same way. And instead "thank you", I am called fucking pedophile, please go and hang yourself. 




 Well sorry, I am not native english speaker :3 




 Well you can look muricans and see where their foods are taking them. It is not only fat and salt but also all those chemicals and gene manipulated shit they put in their bodies. All those chemicals are not even properly tested. GL, I am still going to eat naturally. ;3 




 They are not naturally produced. Why you should put anything non natural in food? 




 It is not like we dont know what it is. We also know it is not dangerous to people. But idea of using blood entsyms in food to make it look more appealing is just alone discusting. Well I think this might also be culture thing and what I have understood there is quite lot wierd things going in food production in murica. 




 Well that partitial thing is the worst, it is like little teasing. 




 It is pretty, I like it. 




 Well not THAT WAY SEXUAL retards.... There is definetly one damn fancy naked butt in that pic.. and usually fancy naked butt pics are NSFW.  




 I am pretty sure OP is some kind of engineer. "Hey lets build perfect meal! All we need is some glue". 




 nvm, that sounds creepy if you think it wrong way.. 




 "Dad, why babysitter is hairy man with leather suit?" 




 Can you actually turn somebody gay? :O 




 Well you basically made factory produced food for your family. 




 So you are basically feeding your family with this... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydzIlKJmwV4 




 I think this is kinda sexual.. NSFW? 




 That hat? You are going to make some kind left-wing hippie out of her? 




 I would probably taste it, but seriously meat glue? I am not sure how common meat glue is in murica but in here it is same as eating shit. 




 The guy in mid is obvious hipster. He had glasses before they were cool and stopped using them when they became mainstream.
