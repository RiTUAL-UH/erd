 The guy in the picture is thinking *no way in hell I'm passing up a hot dog* 




 Just trying to gather some info from those who've newly found teaching positions in the area, and from those who are still looking.

What type of certification will districts be looking for? How big is the pool of applicants in respect to the number of positions open? 

Thanks!  




 Welcome back, Solar Bears. Such a quirky team with a weird history. Win a championship...cease to exist for a decade. 

Hope they are still wearing turquoise and eggplant purple jerseys with lowercase letters on the back. Be traditional, Orlando!

 Surprisingly enough, Defensive TD Total (7) = Rushing TD Total (7).

Not to mention, Forte: 3 Total TDs. Tillman   Briggs (combined): 4 TDs 




 He is 5th overall in WR scoring in my league. I'd say a must start every week. He was a full-participant in practice as well.

 I guess you need to look at economic/social trends in Eastern Europe. I live in an area with a high population of new immigrants from Poland. BMWs, iphones, and flashy clothing is very ubiquitous among this group. (much different from my Polish relatives who came here ~100 years ago, who primarily came in a wave of lesser-skilled labor)

A number of the 21st Century immigrants are probably coming here for work because of their technical or specialized knowledge. 




 Where's the bright green relish? 




 Total Bears domination in all phases. 




 51= Highest point total recorded by the Bears since 1980.
 




 Great idea here: new logo features a man with a hockey stick.  




 Ah. That makes more sense.
 




 Not the "Fighting Sioux" anymore, I guess. 









 You mean pop 




 60 Gears?
 




 The bad luck began on draft day for this kid, being taken by the Islanders, a team that hasn't made a serious playoff run in his lifetime. 




 Was Georges [Dennis Rodman] (http://www.rrstar.com/carousel/x12623212/Grounded-Dennis-Rodman-to-visit-Rockford-on-Friday?photo=0) for Halloween? 




 I've been used to working 55 hrs a week for a while now. Draining work for sure, but I've got to imagine it's only about 4 months. 




 Thanks! This sounds a lot like what the job climate/ lifestyle is like for my uncle. I am definitely going to seek out his point of view as well. 




 Not incredibly random. I have a family member who is successful in the field, and have seen some of my college classmates transition into the professional field fairly soon after graduation.

It really takes a special kind of person to become an MD, and it really only pays more in the long run, considering that 4yrs of medical school + being an intern + the cost of school-related debt and malpractice insurance etc., etc., ...I cannot imagine that most MDs are making good money until they are past 30.  




 As is the case with many of us who are fresh graduates. Does an internship necessarily mean that you work for months in the field w/o getting paid? Already did an "internship" while student teaching, where I pretty much took over a classroom for 4 months, having to work nights and weekends w/o my university or cooperating school district knowing. Hoping not to get stuck in that situation at this point in my life.  




 Here is my situation: 24 y/o BA in Secondary Education; BA in History.

After two unsuccessful summers of not landing a full-time position as a history teacher, I am planning to do something more practical in place of the subject that I feel passionate about. The economic incentives of being a substitute teacher or a private school teacher are non-existent. I make more in my current position at a reading clinic/ my union weekend job.

From a purely practical/economic perspective, does it make sense for me to jump into a Masters of Science in Accounting program? 

It seems that the opportunities are more bountiful in this field, and if I strike out at landing a teaching job next year I'm probably going to give up anyway. Assuming that I can complete CPA certification, I probably can use a family connection to help me land a position in the accounting field. Just wanted to know if there is anything beneath the surface that would make it equally difficult for me in this field.

Thanks!
TLDR: (see title of post)  




 If lost forever in an endless field of celery, with no other edible items available I would begin to cannibalize myself before taking my first bite of celery. 




  In the game without disc Kane has significant shortcomings. 




 His presence on the power play was such valuable piece to the championship run. Let's be honest; the power play last year sucked. So, yes I miss the guy who was an immovable beast causing havoc in front of the goal. 




 Is this why cilantro tastes like soap to me? Not many flavors out there that I dislike, I'm just not a huge fan of soap. 




 [Cumin, Wicker Park.] (http://www.cumin-chicago.com/) You can get a big serving of Lamb or Chicken Vindaloo for $12.  




 So many good ones from Season 2. That fact alone is why I've already given up trying to make a list. I'd like someone to list "Dennis   Dee get a new dad" though. Frank's *my wife is a whooooor* meltdown was legendary. 




 Piranha plant 




 I am starting F.Jones, Sproles, and Wayne week 7; I think you'd be best suited with F.Jones and Ridley in your starting lineup. A good dilemma to have @ WR, you can't go wrong. I like Wayne   Welker. They should see tons of targets.     




 Great start for Eddie Lack. This is his year to show that he has what it takes to play in the NHL. Anything less than an all-star nomination will be a disappointment. 




 Not the most popular, but one of the best lines was while driving a TVR. 

*and this CS button is for... Commit Suicide*
 




 Pick up Richardson if possible. He fell an eyelash short of 100 yds yesterday and had just 13 touches (11 rushes, 2 catches). Plus, the Rams are probably going to part ways w/ SJax at the end of the year, so they will probably give him a good deal of work in the near future to see what he can do.  




 Yes. Maclin isn't on too many leagues' waiver wires, jump on that opportunity. 




 As soon as i read the description for this thread an image of a purple Prowler just appeared in my mind. 




 Damn. Primarily over-expansion and overspending.  




 **[ENTRY]** [Pontiac Fiero GT] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FIEROi2.jpg) Why? An American mid-engine two-seater from a defunct manufacturer that is made almost entirely of plastic and has a weird cargo section near the engine, no bonnet (hood), and still has a cult following. 

Get Clarkson in one of these, would love to see his reactions to it.  




 [This video] (http://www.empireofsoccer.com/flashback-vid-the-nasl-shootout-new-york-cosmos-v-washington-diplomats/) shows the intensity and suspense that were present in NASL shootouts. The league really had a few glory moments. Pele came to the New York Cosmos, and for a while fans were thrilled and passionate. 

I watched the movie "Once in a Lifetime" the story of the New York Cosmos, and it seemed like the league could have created a whole new soccer experience for Americans.

I wasn't alive to experience the NASL, so my question for those who were is this: Why did it fizzle out? 
 




 Soccer is and has always been my favorite sport, but I honestly hate matches that end in a draw. [The NASL concept] (http://www.empireofsoccer.com/flashback-vid-the-nasl-shootout-new-york-cosmos-v-washington-diplomats/) to end matches had to have been such a suspenseful and awesome experience for fans though. I just wish that this concept would have caught on on a bigger scale, because no true soccer fan likes watching matches decided on penalty kicks. 




 The tie is a dead concept in the NHL with the dawn of the shootout. 




 This kid was quite the sniper for the Rampage a few years back. Such an abrupt and unfortunate ending. 




 In... the wulllld. 




 Merry Christmas from Chernobyl. 




 VW Fox? 




 Wayne. He's red hot and getting a plethora of targets. NYJ are not playing good defense at all. 




 Pettigrew is droppable. I hesitated to pull the plug on him, but his 5pts per week simply aren't paying off. You've got a better option there in K. Rudolph.    




 Risque pics. Your Volvo was showing in the last two. 




 My opponent will be praying that he scores 52 tonight. Not a bad monday night outside of the fact that the Texans/Jets matchup isn't interesting.  




 [second creepiest] (http://www.imglols.com/disturbing-jesus-chair/) 




 Your pictures are a testament to how much Hyundai evolved from decades past. From the time [this was their idea of a sports coupe] ( http://www.autoevolution.com/cars/hyundai-scoupe-1992.html) until now it's reasonable to say that no other car manufacture has underwent such a image transformation. 




 In the spirit of this post, it's redundant redundancy. 




 Those were some sad times, my friend. That was our scoring line in Chicago. 




 5 ints! Romo is did a better impression of a Bears quarterback than the actual Bears quarterback. 




 Almost a decade later and the mention of [that] (http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=105344) still makes me cringe. Scott Stevens couldn't exist in today's NHL. 




 Hockey's Champions' League? What fan of hockey wouldn't love that. 




 Hell yes. A truly International Hockey League? The old IHL (RIP 1945-2001) only had one team, Soviet Wings, outside of N.A. for just one season.   

This would open up so many opportunities to see different styles of play   really good players who never fit into the North American style of play.  




 Not that surprising at all. A number of people in Jefferson Park, including my aunt, are keeping chickens. The serenade of chicken clucks and shrieks  isn't foreign to the Northside. 

When I was in undergrad i saw [this guy] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lJqRq0RAsk) almost every day! 




 Considering that most of this car is made of plastic, and that V8 is sitting right in the middle of it, you've got a very quick little ride there. 

I cannot look at this too long though, it's making me sad. Why it had to end for Pontiac while soulless Buick keeps on living is a reality I do not want to accept. 




 Consider the Mazda 3. Consumer Report is saying that it is a great buy. The new "Skyactiv" engine gets the best fuel economy in its class and is actually more fuel-efficient than Mazda's subcompact Mazda 2. Additionally, the long-term costs are projected to be low considering the trends of the Mazda 3's build quality and reliability over the past few years. The price is not that much different than the Cruze or Focus either.

I wish i was in the market for one today.
