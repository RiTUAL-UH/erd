 and some with good modding community if no magic system?

Good as in interesting magic systems. 














 It says on the official page one of the reviews say that it's similar to Nobilis, that's why i said that. 




  Mythender

People say it's like Nobilis do you know more about the system?

As in how do powers work and such?

Also game's free, awsome. 




 Although in french it looks like a good and original system what i don't seem to like is the limited number or powers and such, but i may try to house rule some more in there.

I like the weapons having free will, i can already imagine a paladin with a murderous rapist sword, you know, classy stuff, like in the example of the guy saving two girls and the sword wanting a "peculiar reward" against the wielder's will. 




 How powerful can a rifts character become? 




 How powerful can a character be? 




 I love those kinds of systems, i know about Nobilis, Chuubo, Don't rest your head, Mage the awakening, amber dice less one thing i disliked about amber is it's short array of powers, i like having alot of room to choose.

Also giving little more info on how powerful can a character be would be great.
