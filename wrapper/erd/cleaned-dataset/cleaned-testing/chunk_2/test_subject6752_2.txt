 It's just so disheartening that they don't understand what donation is and what it's like to not be able to have a kid with the person you love. Forget their lack of respect for their SO's bodily autonomy. 









 About me: I'm 20F and married to a woman. I identify as nonbinary but my mom said I can "get a sex change ten years after" she's dead. My wife is also 20. We've been together nearly five years.

A bit of back story; I had this job working with a guy with Down syndrome. I loved it. I love him. The agency doesn't pay regularly and every two weeks, when my pay was due, I was crying because they somehow fucked me over. This caused me to lose my apartment. I have since quit the job. During my last week, the last week of January, the master cylinder in my car went so I have no brakes. I used my dad's truck for work, and emailed my professors that I couldn't be on campus. I have not gone to class in two weeks and am at risk for being dropped from 18 credits and losing my financial aid.

Last night, he comes home from work and starts yelling at me that the truck is damaged and I drove it last. We live in a college town and have several houses on our street that have college kids. One had a party Friday night. Apparently someone drunk ripped off his mirror. I said I had nothing to do with it, which I didn't, and he starts yelling that I wasted a ton of gas and abused my use of the truck. When I told him that I hadn't used it except to go a mile each night but that on Friday I had a ton to do to get my car fixed, and that I was at risk for failing out of school, he yelled at me that it wasn't his fault and that if I didn't run my car into the ground this wouldn't have happened. 

I told him the master cylinder went on a 10 year old car and there was nothing I could have done. I went  upstairs to grab my stuff to leave and he yelled "don't forget to slam your door" in the douchiest tone possible. 

As I went down the stairs, I said "I'm depressed and can't afford counseling and nobody in this house cares!" And then I left. I called my best friend crying and he came to hang out with me in a local Rite Aid. We tried to drive my car but the brakes are completely gone so my dad told me to take his truck, no reference to previous conversation. My mom hasn't mentioned it either. 

She had known that I was seeing a counselor at my college for about three months and knew it ended with the last semester. She hasn't mentioned except, when I told her I was going, to say that I was "stronger than that". She has known for five years that I have panic attacks but says that's I'm over dramatic. 

How it's a good thing: I have been not going to the hospital for help because I didn't want to disapoint anyone. They don't care. I'm free to go. 

TL;DR: life sucks, then what? 









 I am knitting this for my friend and my idea is that when her little girl outgrows it, it can be her first pillowcase. Is this safe? 


































 If I have a disagreement with my parents about anything, my wife takes their side. She claims she hates confrontation and is trying to avoid a fight but she just makes me livid. 

Today, for instance, my sick and physically disabled mother was struggling to breathe. When asked if she needed to go to the hospital, she made up an excuse about insurance and not wanting to go. My wife said wait until Monday and then if she isn't better she will go. I have class all day on Monday. My mom said wait until Tuesday. My wife agreed with her. 

Tl;dr: MY MOTHER CAN'T BREATHE AND MY WIFE AGREED TO PUT OFF A HOSPITAL VISIT. 









 I have a 1997 850 and the other day the brake light came on. The manual said it needed fluid, and, when I went to go buy fluid, I had no breaks. My brother put some of his in it and we pumped the breaks and it kept seeming to drain but it isn't spraying or leaking anywhere we can see. Anyone know what's wrong and if it's an easy fix? 




 I think I want T in the future, but I know I want to give birth and breastfeed. If I go on T before that, how likely am I to become infertile? Will I be able to breastfeed? I want to do gel if that matters because I want as much control as possible over results. 




 I have some really severe suicidal ideation, including a preferred method if I were to do so. However, I don't intend to. My understanding is that ER staff do not discriminate between suicidal ideation and suicidal intent. Is this accurate? Do I need to distinguish which I am experiencing?

My mom is physically disabled and rather sick. Since I am self admitting, can I leave if there is an emergency with my family? If so do I need to make this concern clear ahead of time?

I know that, at my hospital, if you have a baby or are sick, your spouse can stay with you overnight once in a while. Is this possible for this situation?

How much say over visitors do I get? My mom can't go and my dad won't so I would really rather be able to just say I don't want them there, but I do want my wife to be able to see me. Is this possible? 

Since I am planning ahead, am I not sick enough or is it not an emergency enough that I should go?

What I need is medication. If possible, I'd like to get a prescription and get out of there. I don't have health insurance or free clinics near me and I'm broke. I'd rather not get even more behind in school if I can avoid it. Can that happen?

Does my college have to be accommodating to this? I'm a first semester sophomore at a community college and I'm taking 18 credits, 3 of them writing intensive. Do they have to be lenient with me or can they fail me over it? Last semester I saw a counselor at my school and we were supposed to work on finding me real help but my insurance fell through. She diagnosed me with depression and anxiety but it's not on paper anywhere. She seemed scared and insistant that I get help ASAP but I really couldn't. Is that relevant or helpful to me?

When I get nervous, I smile, laugh, and joke. In high school when I tried to get help at the safe room, they didn't belive me because of it. I really can't control it. Will the hospital do the same thing?

Is there anything I'm not thinking of that may be important?

Edit: I'm 20 but married. Will I be with kids or adults or adolescents? I live in Pennsylvania for reference. 









 I've poked around and even posted here a bit before, but here goes, I suppose.

I'm Trish/Patric. I'm genderqueer transmasculine. I'm not picky about pronouns at all. Use whatever you like.  My wife and my best friend, who is a transguy, are the only people I'm out to really at the moment. I don't intend to be out to my immediate family. Top surgery is a definite and T is a maybe, bottom surgery is a no go for me. Feel free to ask me whatever you'd like to know. 




 I have diagnosed clinical depression and anxiety and have for almost a decade. For me, that means insomnia and not caring about myself at all. Typically, an adult can bounce back and at least bother to do the bare minimum. I was 11 or 12, though, and not caring developed into terrible habits, that, at 20, I'm still struggling to kick. 

When I joined reddit a bit over a year ago, and came across SCA, I subscribed because I've always been lucky to have great skin, so I figured I might enjoy learning to actually wash my face. It took another nine months or so before I actually used it, but hey, I did eventually. 

Since then, I've started to remember to brush my teeth regularly. I know, gross, but being young and depressed is making bad choices. I've also started to drink water almost exclusively. I'm chubby, by like a lot, and have always been the kind of kid to cut gym class and hang out somewhere else, even if somewhere else is a bathroom. I've started using my college fitness center by choice. 

SCA has really helped me make some positive changes in my life, and I thank all of you for that. 




 My college has a free fitness center available to students. I'm finally taking advantage of it. I'm heavy. Depression will do that to you, as I'm sure a lot of you know. I don't care about losing weight right now. I'm just happy to be able to take the steps without getting winded. Today was day three of roughly 20 minute workouts and already I feel better physically. It doesn't seem to help my depression like people claim it will, but physically its not bad and I even find myself enjoying after years of cutting gym in high school. It's something at least. 









 Married: 1 month, 10 days.

Number of times we've had sex: 17.

Highlights: 10 were in the first week of being married. 

On our wedding night, you fell asleep with my nipple in your mouth, throwing me into a panic attack. I still count that time. 

You've gone down on me once, and you weren't happy about it. 

I love you but dammit baby you're supposed to want to have sex with your new wife. If we did the penny jar first year thing, we couldn't buy a McChicken at the end of the year.


Edit: thank you guys for being so supportive. I was in a bad spot last night when I posted this. I have diagnosed depression and anxiety and one of my symptoms when I get seriously upset is that I can't sleep, which manifested into this. My wife and I (yes, we're lesbians for those of you who expressed confusion) communicate endlessly. She has a lower sex drive than me and I need to get over it. Last night I was upset because, I after I went down on her and then got her off a second time, she had no interest in either going down on me or otherwise doing what I like. We have discussed it multiple times and I need to learn to accept it. Prior to getting married we averaged 3 to 4 times every week. Our wedding week ramped it up and I'm just hating the slow down. She has PCOS so hormone stuff is totally wacky meaning her libido is, too, but it sucks to be 20 and have her have a low sex drive. 




 I have what my best friend, who's a transguy, and I call "trans memories" which are memories from childhood that, if it happened now, you would know that you were trans*. For me, these include being seven and trying to use a toilet paper roll as an STP; being 10 and seeing the "Transitions" episode of Law and Order: SVU and crying because I thought my parents must have had me surgically made into a girl when I was born. Also during my childhood, I had plenty of experience being reminded that my mom knew when she found out she was pregnant with me that I would be a healthy girl because God didn't give her 16 years of not being able to get pregnant to give her another boy (I have two older adopted brothers and my parents fostered over 40 boys in the mid 80s). Whenever I wear my binder, which I have been a lot lately thanks to you guys giving me advice on it, she makes comments about how I look deformed and says that I must be binding in the most disgusted voice. I'm out to her as a butch lesbian, but when I came out she told me I had to wait until 10 years after she was dead if I was going to become a guy. She accepts other transpeople she just doesn't want it for me. It's hard. I'm just starting to feel better in my skin and she makes fun of me... I can't be out to her. It would kill her. She's physically disabled with a whole list of medical problems. It just sucks. 




 I work 17.5 hours every week, I have 18 credit hours this semester, I take care of my disabled mom and I need to do well this semester to graduate on time. I transport my wife to and from her job, too. My dad expects me to do everything. Today he told me brother (who does nothing. I repeat, nothing at all. He plays video games and sponges off of my family and his girlfriend. He's almost 19.) To tell me I had to get the balance of his debit card. They are both more than capable and I already do so much else and I didn't want to so I refused. He started harassing me about how I eat off the money so I can do it. He gets my food almost never. 

My wife and I both work. If we don't have enough after bills, my mom will get us food. I left. I wanted a cigarette so fucking bad but I'm trying not to smoke this year. Also, I don't have any money to buy a pack with. I want to die so bad. It's always little bullshit like this, but it adds up. It sounds so fucking stupid that this makes me feel this way. 

I'm quitting my job in 2 weeks because they often don't bother to pay me and I have to wait forever for my money. That's why my wife and I live with my parents. I feel like a goddamn failure. I'm 20, married, doing well enough for me in school (I have a 3.08) and I love my job but they don't pay me so I have to live at home. It fucking sucks. I know I won't kill myself. I have too much responsibility to kill myself. One day it will get better. But right now it fucking sucks. 


My school councilor diagnosed me with depression and anxiety but she can't really do anything to help. I don't have money for a doctor or insurance so I'm just fucking stuck. I can't check out of life for a week to get help because of all the fucking responsibility. I'm sorry for the wall of text. I just sort of needed to vent and all.

Edit: You guys are so great. I don't have a response right now for each of you, but know that you help me greatly. I ended up hanging out with a friend tonight and walking around the mall locally. I don't know if I'll go to the hospital any time soon, honestly. My wife won't have a way to get to and from school without me. That's not fair to her. Honestly, I'm scared. We haven't slept apart for more than one night since I was like 16. I don't want to be without her for that long.  




 I have a full torso binder, but it rolls too much so I'm trying to fold it up and over like some dudes suggested the other day. It's great for my chest, but I feel like I look pregnantish. Did anyone else feel this way at first? When did that feeling go away? I am trying to lose weight, but I'm pre or non T (not sure yet) so my body fat is very female distrusted. 



















 Where did you find binding/packing materials and the like? How did you get information about therapists and HRT? It's tough enough now with the Internet to help, but I can't figure out how it was done before then. 




 I have and Underworks 997 binder and a very large chest. While it does a pretty good job of flattening me, it will roll up on occasion, and it's very difficult to get it back down without my wife's help. Has anyone else had this problem? How can I keep this from happening?  
























 My job requires paperwork to be done at home, on my time. It takes three times as long to do it by hand as by computer, so I computerized all of it and have no access to the means to do it by hand. I have the forms that must be filled already partially and incorrectly filled in Excel, but no access to fix it. My job has already withheld my pay for 3 weeks and it will likely be 3 more or even longer before I see my money. I cannot afford to pay for the one month subscription. If anyone is willing to let me use their login just temporarily, I would really appreciate it. 







































 I don't care about the discrimination I face. I don't care that teachers bullied me in high school. I care that my mom and so many other people say that if I had the choice I'd have chosen to be straight. I wouldn't. I love everything about being gay. I love gay culture, I love having a cause, I love my wife, I love going to pride. I love being gay. Why is that such a bad thing? That really gets me down... 




 The character, who's name escapes me, dies in Phoenix with his boyfriend and I think his mother. The hospital disposes of his body wrapped in a garbage bag with other garbage. His boyfriend pays a funeral establishment to have him cremated despite the hospital's refusal to issue a death certificate. I have tried to Google this, but I can't come up with anything definitively confirming or denying it. 




 My job doesn't pay me when or what or how they're supposed to and it's really contributed to my mounting depression and anxiety. 

In high school, I started the Gay Straight Alliance for my school. Today I found out that my successor's successor, whom I selected for the role, got into her dream school with a full merit scholarship strongly because of her role as President of the GSA. She Facebook messaged me and thanked me for giving her the opportunity to reach this goal. 

It helped me to realize that I have a positive impact on people's lives and gave me the boost I needed to send this email. I don't even know if the place is hiring, but I tried, and for that I'm proud of myself. 

Today was a good day, Reddit. 




 I'm pretty upset for good reason and sitting in a McDonald's typing this, so sorry if it's all jumbled and fucked up.

We recently moved back in with my parents because my job doesn't like to pay me correctly and we couldn't keep up with our rent. My 18 year old brother is prince of the mother fucking earth. He does whatever the fuck he wants, including, tonight, when he came in the bathroom while I was showering and turned on the sink water and started flipping out and calling me names because I let his stupid ass dog in his room so it wouldn't shit on my goddamn flood. Big surprise, the fucking puppy shit on the floor. He should have taken the fucking dog out or put it in it's crate if he wasn't going to be able to take it out. I told him to turn the water off because the family dog had just puked all over me and I was trying to get cleaned off. He wouldn't. I told him to get the fuck out of the bathroom. He said "Or what, you'll sit on me?" 

I ran to my room and got dressed. I went downstairs and told my parents that SOMETHING needs to be done about their goddamn hellion. My dad said "I hate to say it, but I think it's time you find a place to live." My wife and I left and came to this McDonald's. I don't know what the fuck to do from here. We have no money, about 200$ in food stamps and a quarter of a tank of gas. I have to work tomorrow and I know they won't fucking pay me anyway. We just finished the last day of our semester of college, so switching to dorming isn't possible right now. I don't know what to do. 

If you're just commenting to tell me I'm awful, please, save it.

**tl;dr**: My brother's the best and I think I'm homeless. 














 Faux Thanksgiving was the Tuesday after the normal holiday; all of the talk was about her 18 year old, single, uneducated, unemployed, knocked up sister. That's fine. It was all super positive and everyone (except those of us with brains) is excited for her. My wife's aunt and uncle were there. They didn't say hello to me and only spoke to me to show me a picture of their dog. They also walked past me to say goodbye to others and didn't acknowledge me again. Then, we found out, her mother and said knocked up sister started shit talking us as soon as we left. 

Her mother originally did not intend to come to our wedding. After she was called out on it, she decided she would show up. Knocked up sister had an appointment and didn't show up. Mother made fun of our venue, made fun of my wife's outfit and feet, and complained that it was too small of a wedding. She left as soon as possible, no congratulations were offered and she texted later asking for her Crock Pot back since she forgot it. She owes my wife 15 dollars for a Mary Kay item and we haven't seen the money despite asking several times and really needing the money, and I felt it was ballsy to ask for it back when she owes us.

Last night was the family Christmas party. The only people who said hello to me were my MIL's ex roomate who felt awkward that everyone was ignoring me and my wife's other aunt. The pregnant sister tried to push me down some stairs and everyone else pretty much just ignored me. My wife was said hello to, I was just ignored.

My wife also has 3 younger sisters; they're 15, 15, and 13. I went all out on gifts for them. They're great kids and we get along great. I do not feel at all motivated or obligated to get gifts for the mother or other sister for Christmas. I need my money more. I am sick of going to things like this to be treated like shit. I hate it.

**tl;dr**: Wife's family is a bunch of twatwaffles and I'm sick of it. 
























 :D 









 I'm a lesbian and a United Methodist. If this sub isn't really a gay friendly one, can anyone direct me to one that is? I'm working on trying to get over my depression, and seeing homophobic posts won't help. 









 I hope this is okay here; just subscribed today and this is my first post here. Sorry if it's not okay.


I unsubscribed from a lot of the defaults with the whole "bro culture" thing going on and am hoping it will help, since I let the comments and what not affect me too much. If it doesn't help, I'm probably going to leave reddit for a while, or at least delete the app from my phone, because for the last year, my depression has gotten worse and the main change has been my use of reddit that has gone up drastically, especially over the last several months. I dunno. I guess I'm just trying.  




 Are any littles... nonhuman? My little's "character" is a baby bear (age 5 and a half) named Meribell. Is name changing typical too? I also have a "character" that's a little who is a baby horse (age 4 and a half) named Ponyo. Is that at all common? Her "real" self is the big to my little and vice versus. Sometimes the littles play together and get into mischief. Does that happen for anyone else? It's also 100% non sexual. We're actually both turned off by the idea of including littles in sexual stuff. Is that at all common? I read the FAQ but I guess I'm a little confused about if we qualify? 









 She is 20, almost 21, and we have been together for over four years. She is likes to talk about fairies and princesses and has this intense love for all things "cute and chubby" as she puts it, meaning adorably pudgy dogs and bunnies and the like. She loves to tell bedtime stories before we go to sleep, which usually either center around fairies, princesses, or horses. She is obsessed with horses, but without a real desire to own one.

It's the cutest thing in the world. I can't wait for us to get married in a little over a week. I hope she never grows up. 














 /r/BoiFashionAdvice/

/r/MaleFashionAdvice tends not to help us out much, though their style is great, and /r/LesbianFashionAdvice is dead and focuses primarily on femmes. I created something for those of us who are bois, and fall somewhere south of masculine but not quite feminine either. 









 Edit: I didn't mean medical services sucked, I meant administration. Also, why doesn't the ACA help with this? Or has it just not yet? I get that vets shouldn't have to, but with the demand they may benefit from going outside the VA. I just feel like there is a lot I don't get. 



















 Bought a pack about a month ago. Wondering what they'll be like and for how long.  









 I personally like to fall asleep to audio books. I don't like to pay for them just to fall asleep. They're free on YouTube. 









 My girlfriend and I had been getting pretty heavy before she left for work. We had agreed that, when she got home, sexy times were to be had. Since we are currently living with my parents, they have to be sort of planned. 

Being a good girlfriend, I decided to wash our collection while I was in the shower, and left them out to dry on her towel, with it folded over. The family dog comes in, and, being the good dog that she is, starts snuggling me. When my girlfriend got home, I had shown her that I washed everything, so the towel was folded up, and everything was exposed.

Now I'm sure plenty of you are thinking that my dog grabbed one and brought it to my mom. That, happily, is not what happened. My brother came in my room to see if I wanted him to get the dog. After he left, I glanced over at the dog, and, between her and I, was a towel covered in sex toys. My brother just left and I'm hoping he decides to avoid talking to me until he forgets about this.

TL;DR I washed my sex toys then put them on display for my brother. 




 My soon-to-be-wife and I will be most likely attending Smith in about a year. We want to start a queer girl Four Seasons cover band. Anyone with knowledge or interest, feel free to comment! 




 Ask anything you wanna know, even if it's offensive. I will answer anything. 
























 I am a full time student. I am extremely intelligent, as awkward as it is for me to proclaim that. My GPA is falling fast.

I am the only daughter and despite the fact that my father is still married to and lives with my mom, I am the one primarily if not soley responsible for her care now that she is disabled. No one else will do anything for her but me.

I work as a companion to a man with Down Syndrome. I have for almost a year and a half. I go out of my way to better his life. No raise or even a thank you. I work until 10 most Fridays with a 10 hour day so he can belong to a bowling league and I get no praise. The paperwork tripled and I can't keep up with it and everything else and I haven't been paid my hours in 2 months and my gas reimbursement in 3 and a half. 

I am so burnt out.

Edit: I think I misexplained. I haven't been paid because I can't keep up with the paper work required to get my pay. I have to write the equivalent of a one page essay on the guy every night, plus the math for the mileage, and I just can't keep up. I was promised it would decrease after I complained, but it hasn't. It's my fault I haven't been paid.

This a picture of my stuffed doll, Baby. I got her 20 years ago for my first Christmas. She originally had an attached blanket on her wrist (left I believe) that was cut off from being holey when I was a kid. My understanding is that she was a FisherPrice doll that came in blue, yellow, or, like mine, pink terrycloth. Clearly, she has grown tattered over the years. I am hoping to be able to purchase another one. I have tried various searches over the last several years, and if you have any direction to offer, please feel free. Thank you. 




 I want genital changes and not really facial or body hair. Is this possible? 



















 I'm genderqueer, sorta somewhere not quite sure, but I'd like to have the possibility in the event that I choose to medically transition. I am applying for Obamacare in a few days and I was just wondering. I live in Pennsylvania if it matters. 




 My girlfriend, or well, fiance, and I are getting married December 10th! I am SO happy. We had originally planned our wedding for spring of 2016, but recently learned that if we did that, she would not be able to get financial aid for college. We are having a quick ceremony with a district magistrate and then having a small party. We are announcing it as our engagement, and that's great by me. She's happy about it, too. I am just so happy and wanted to share. 



















 I have been out for almost six years. I have been with my partner for over four. Last night, though we've had sex, even great sex, before, was the first time I've ever truly made love to a woman.

For the first time, I didn't emotionally compare it to what my expectations of sex with a man are. For one, they're unrealistic as I've never had sex with a man, and for two, it is so stupid to try to compare sex with a woman to sex with a man.

For the first time, I didn't have to fantasize to orgasm. Generally, I think about something I've read or watched, not really filling myself or my partner into any of the roles. It also generally involves a man. Last night, I didn't. When I tried to in order to finish faster, it made it more difficult. I didn't have to think at all; just feel.

For the first time, I was completely satisfied after I finished. I didn't really crave anything else. Typically, after my partner has gone to sleep, I will get myself off one more time before I fall asleep. Last night I had no desire to do that.

For the first time, I didn't concentrate on what might be best for her while she's touching me. I paid attention to me, since it was my "turn" anyway. I generally do whatever it takes to finish fast for her so she isn't left spending a million years on me. Last night, I just cared about what felt good and let myself enjoy it.

We discussed it afterword, and she felt the same way. She is the only woman I've ever dated, though, since I'm not even 20 and we've been together so long, it isn't that surprising. I'm the only woman she has ever dated. I guess there is still a bit of a learning curve, but I'm really looking forward to experiencing this and more again.  












































 My girlfriend has three little sisters; twin 15yo and the other will be 14 in the beginning of January. The twins have been asking my advice on skin care because mine is flawless (THANK YOU FOR TEACHING ME!) and they both have acne rather bad. The younger one has great skin but care isn't a bad thing and she's a copycat and would love it. Now, about their skin.

Twins; both girls have normal to oily skin, leaning slightly more toward oily. Both have acne, primarily in the form of white heads and some scarring due to their mother doing extractions. They are allergic to salicylic acid. Their goals are to clear up acne and my goal for them is to teach them the importance of skin care even when your skin is clear. Their skin is the opposite of mine so I don't really know what they need. They are on hormonal birth control to help control their acne as well.

Younger sister; normal skin that is clear with minor breakouts now and then but nothing extreme. Also allergic to salicylic acid, so my routine goes out the window dispite having very similar skin. She desires to prevent breakouts and be like her sisters. 

If you have specific product recommendations or anything to avoid, please, any advice helps. 




 My girlfriend and I have been together four years and are 19 and 20. My parents are rather poor and provide housing for us but we are responsible for our own food and cell phones and we pay the electric bill. My girlfriend's parents are both very well off and provide absolutely nothing for her, including emotional support. Their incomes have both increased dramatically over the last year, and her younger sister is no longer a dependent so her financial aid will be terrible and she does not benefit from her parents' money at all.


We live in a state with same sex marriage and are willing to go that route, as we plan to marry next spring anyway, but we would prefer to wait until then if possible. Can she get declared independent otherwise?

 My girlfriend is the oldest of five girls and was born to her mother when her mother and father were 19. She has a very poor relationship with her father and a so-so one with her mother. Her three youngest sisters and her get along great, but her other sister, the only one with the same father as my girlfriend, has had issues with my girlfriend since we got together. She has actively tried to ruin our relationship and give my girlfriend's parents false information about me to get them to hate me as well. It worked with her father.

Tonight, we went to dinner at her mom's for the first time in over six months. Her mother was insistent that my girlfriend get into contact with her sister. My girlfriend has been trying to talk to her sister, but her sister has no interest as, this summer, when her sister got "engaged" to a man she has known for 2 months and been dating for one, my girlfriend texted her asking exactly how long they had been together. We found out about her engagement via Facebook. Her mother, after my girlfriend's explanation, showed my girlfriend ultrasound pictures with sister's name on them. She is due in April.

My girlfriend tried to contact her sister through call and text, she ignored the texts and literally made sounds like she had no signal on the phone. She intentionally went to her friend's house so she wouldn't see us. Also, she and the "fiance" broke up and she is moving 3 hours away to live with their dad next week.

My girlfriend wants to be involved, but was asked not to let on that she knew. She wants to see her before she leaves as well. We have no idea what she should do.

**tl;dr**: Sister is pregnant and hiding it and won't talk to us and is moving away in a week.

 Ma'am,
You passed so well that after walking away from you my girlfriend and I commented to each other on it. I assure you no one else was reading you. But I did. I read you when we made eye contact and you looked terrified that you thought I knew. It wasn't your height, even though you stood several inches above my 5'5". It wasn't your face, which was just as feminine as any other lady's face. It was your lack of confidence and fear that made me see any other indicators. I wanted in that moment so badly to hug you and tell you it was all okay and not to be so worried. Walmart at midnight may not be the safest place, but it also isn't the worst. No one even knew. You were just as safe as all other women in that store were and I wish there had been a way for me to communicate that to you. I hope my subtle smile and aversion of my eyes after our eye contact didn't further freighten you or make you think you didn't pass. I am proud of you for being yourself and presenting in public. I hope youbhave the courage to do it again, and maybe next time, if I see you, I'll have a better way to show you that I support you. 

Signed, 
The Lesbian from 2368. 









 We were riding in the car chatting about how, the previous night, she wanted me to cuddle her because she was feeling sick and I wanted sex because I was feeling horny. In order to not bother her, I opted to watch porn when she fell asleep. All in good fun, she was ribbing me about the fact that I hate her because I didn't cuddle her. I corrected her and said that I didn't cuddle her because I hate her is what she meant. Then, Reddit, I fucked up. I said "I don't hate you because you're fat, you're fat because I hate you." 




 I know Reddit circle jerks about how stupid it is but I don't know what it is. Please explain. 














 I'm sorry if this isn't allowed but I didn't know where else to ask. I work as a companion to a 29 year old man with Down Syndrome. Socially amd emotionally, I'd guess he's between 12 and 14, but he is illiterate to the point of not knowing the alphabet.  

We have rules about his cell phone. He isn't to call me before 7:50 am ever. Last week we added the rules that on Mondays I will call him at 10am to chat since I have off and don't want to be up that early and if he needs to call and I don't pick up, he calls once and I will call back.

In July we had a big issue because he called me at 6:30 in the morning. He hasn't been allowed to visit with some questionable friends since. Last Monday, he called at 7:30, leading to the establishment of the additional cell phone rules. 

Yesterday morning, while he knew I was on vacation, he called me four times between 7:52 am and 9:30 am. I chose not to call him because he gave up that privilege when he broke the rules. We spoke about it briefly this morning while I drove him to work and he says he won't do it again but I know he will and, rather than apologizing for his actions, he apologized for the fact that I was upset with him. 

What can I do to help set some better, stronger boundaries and get him to stick to them? Games and stuff are fine as long as they aren't geared at two year olds or overly wordy. Thank you so much! 









 Eateries you like, anything gay, whatever. 














 My girlfriend and I (lesbians) have managed to acquire a JW lady who keeps coming to us. We couldn't turn her away the first time because she came with my girlfriend's aunt, who is a Witness. Now the woman keeps coming back and even purchased each of us a "Bible" and another book. We don't want to convert, and we don't want to stop being lesbians. How do we nicely tell her we aren't even remotely interested without hurting her feelings? 




 I disagree with 99.9% of the things Reddit circlejerks about. 

I am a feminist, Chrisitan, lesbian who identifies as genderqueer. 

Basically, the majority of Reddit's outspoken members hate me and the feeling is rather mutual. I have been here almost a year and don't know why I keep coming back. 



















 Moving back with my parents soon to a 10' by 7' bedroom with 8' ceilings and three doorways. How would you make the most of this space? 









 We compared tongue size. When I woke up this morning I understood why guys compare dick size. 





























 I know you fart more because of contractions in the uterus also cause some in the GI tract, but why are they so smelly?
