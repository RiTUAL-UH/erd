 I was gonna vote for Hillary. Then I died. 




 He isn't using it right. I follow 700 news org in one list and it tells me a lot :) 




 We report, you decide ;) 




 Could you autograph that pic using the sharpie in your ass? Cause that would be freakin awesome. 




 I'll be waiting on my check. I can't vote for her though - she was born in kenya (FACT!) and she promised to take away every gun in America and change us over to Sharia law. 

Yeah. I made all that up. But put it on a website and post it around the net and people on the right will just believe it without thinking. 




 I'm gonna write my own bible, the Chance-a-Sutra. It will have a lot of pictures, including some with guns in them. Can't wait to pass it out at schools there. 




 More than 2,100 paratroopers took place in the operation.

The 82nd Airborne Division conducts thousands of airborne operations each year. Exiting an aircraft in flight with a full combat equipment load comes with inherent risks, but we take prudent precautions to minimize potential injuries, Wilkinson said.

 *Koonin's main point was that humans, together with nature, are now determining the evolution of the Earth's climate, Rosner said. "That is amazing, and given the difficulties we have in managing our affairs, also very scary," he said.*

*"It is time to move on from the fake debate over whether climate change is real or poses a risk, and onto the worthy debate about what actions we must take to avoid a climate catastrophe," he said in an email.*

Well stated - something I am betting many on the right will miss in the whole article. 




 Hannity is pimping this fake story as well - but considering the rw'ers who listen to him I can see why he would. They question nothing and just blindly believe anything (hmmm and many on the right are religious isis like fundies as well....)

Anyway - Obama is planning on letting them fly here in stolen Libyan jets after the isis folks have been exposed to ebola and finished training mexican kids to bring with them for terror attacks. 

Mexican authorities at Taco Bell told me all about Obama's plan. 




 I just thought "5 black guys" was the name of a new burger joint... 




 Yeah....blah blah blah. Obama will take all your guns, crash stock market, destroy America, he is a kenyan born muslim, he will put christians in fema camps, etc.

The right seems to be wrong. A lot. But not one has the guts to ever admit it, do they? I might take their criticism of hillary more seriously if they didn't make up things and fail to own them when they are proven wrong.

Waaah...What is hillary gonna do? Same things the right swore Obama would? ROFL. OK....we believe you. 




 Number 1 answer: "I am conservative who thinks gays are causing god to punish us, that we need more religion in our laws, more wars, less taxes and more money for defense and israel" 




 LOL OMG. You dredge up some old old old newspaper article?

Hillary owns the mind of the right. It is a beautiful thing to behold how she has them all running around.  




 Ohhhh. Rubio...Yeah. This guy:

He criticized judges who are redefining marriage from the bench, claiming that pro-marriage-equality decisions take away the rights of Americans like myself who oppose same-sex marriage: Those who support same-sex marriage have a right to lobby their state legislature to change its laws. But Americans like myself who support keeping the traditional definition of marriage also have the right to work to keep the traditional definition of marriage in our laws without seeing them overturned by a judge.

Calling tolerance a two-way street, he lamented that today there is a growing intolerance on this issue, intolerance towards those who continue to support traditional marriage.

The Florida Family Policy Council announced today that it will host *Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) at its 2013 Annual Dinner. The FFPC is led by John Stemberger, the anti-gay activist who most recently helped launch a Boy Scouts splinter group that will ban openly gay youth, and the fundraiser will honor Liberty Counsel head Mat Staver.* 




 Who is he? Didn't his dad invent the Rubio's cube, or Marco Polo game, or something? 




 Not everyone has time to read all the questions everyday so there will invariably be duplicates. 




 Hey, don't give away our secrets or they will ban that too! 




 Or take it to work and put it in the water cooler. 




 It's funny how the right sees all of this.

God is mad over two men kissing - but he doesn't care at all about wars, murders, robberies, rapes, cops shooting and beating people, poor people starving or not getting health care, putting as many people in prison as you can, etc and so on.

No...all he is mad about is gays and economic policies where you try to help out those in need.

Conservative fundies...they make no sense. 




 I used to vote republican. Up until 2004. Now they are so far gone I don't think I will ever, in my lifetime, even consider voting for them. 

But, either way, they are losing the culture war. Their regressive, religious, policies keep getting beaten. 

Consider this. The right complains about ISIS/Fundie muslims all the time. The reason? Because those groups aren't as progressives as they say Christians now are. Think about that. They are actually saying progressive changes are good and regressive fundies (the muslim ones) are evil/bad.

Maybe, just maybe, they will run with that and move to being even more progressive....now that they use the term 'progressive' in a positive light. I won't hold my breath, but what they rail against is, to some extent, what they are here in the US. Regressive. 




 Indeed. In fact, it from one of their playbooks:
1. Cut unemployment benefits because people getting them are milking the system and not getting jobs.

2. Shoot down proposals to spur job creation.

3. Complain that, because of Obama there are no jobs. Blame Obama and the unemployed.

4. Claim to have a solution - cut even more benefits (food stamps) and decrease taxes on the rich so they can create more jobs (oddly enough, again, admitting there aren't enough jobs but cutting benefits anyway and calling those in need lazy welfare bums).

Not much they do makes sense. But then, folks like rush and such wanted America to fail so they can blame Obama and tell people 'told you so' for electing Obama (the old fundie idea of punishing 'sinners')

Conservatives....they want to break America for some reason (and yet, they have failed to do so the last 8 years, which makes them sad). 




 I prefer local talk radio (and have worked in some radio over the years and did my own show). One of my fav stations here for many years have been over taken by beck/rush/hannity/levin. Yeah, there are other stations locally but none I have found that are mostly local talk.

Local issues don't get enough play. One of the guys that had a show here moved onto 700wlw so I pick him up there but still not really 'local' anymore (same state). 

Add into the mix how difficult it is to get a license and choices plummet (our show was on pirate radio). Big companies buy up the spectrum and keep out competing stations. 




 *Really to believe that 5 million Jews know better than 6 billion people of the world?* 

It isn't just Jews in Israel. It's republicans here in the US who put god/bible/Israel ahead of country. 

They worship Israel, hate gays, etc all because they fear what god might do to 'murica (they ignore crime, wars, adultery, eating bacon, screwing over the poor and those in prison, etc).

We have our own little isis like group in the US that vote for and push for laws based on religion and will toss this country aside for another country that runs itself based on religion. 




 I don't expect a lot from various subreddits :) but one would think fellow humans participating wouldn't be so...well, dumb or transparent. 




 I lived there for a spell. It is the armpit of CA. Sooo glad to be away from there. Ridgecrest and Tehachapi were much better places IMHO. 




 Apparently. I can think of whole news orgs that annoy me ;) 




 Maybe it is because she is running the youtube server from her home? Benghazi!!! 




 Because this was an action by a government official and not some random kid. 




 It's not like it could hurt him any.... 




 He was also born in kenya, had a fake BC, took away all the guns in the US, allowed ebola to spread and kill millions of Americans, crashed the stock market, sold out the US to muslims for a caliphate....etc.

And this is what pisses people off? LOL. 




 This is an update to some earlier stories, now with video and more information. 




 Well, is it legal like moving your HQ to another country to avoid taxes? If so, how can anyone complain about it. I am sure there won't be any republicans or conservatives who will complain that the Obama's operated within the law for their own benefit. 

PS - no, I am not upset with Obama here since he exercised a right other parents have as well. 




 I bet, because he said that, conservatives won't vote for Hillary. Damn, that man sure is powerful and intelligent! "Don't trust someone I don't like!" because, you know, before all republicans did.

Gonna be a long, dumb, campaign season. 




 Hmmm "thepunditpress". Let's see how conservatives will view something like this.

Guessing: It will make them say things like "See!! It's all fake, no one has ever mistreated a black/muslim/woman/gay person. This is why I am SMART and don't trust people!"

But then, someone posts a story where a cop shoots an unarmed American citizen, and it's on video. Suddenly..."So, one bad apple! You can't judge all cops by this. If a cop says he shot someone I got his back and won't just assume he/she is lying!"

Cons..... 




 If Bush and Clinton ran together they would be unstoppable. The, after 8 years Chelsea and another Bush could run together. 

It would be like Kang and Kodos. The two families could rule the earth together forever. 




 It cooks faster than in a conventional oven. 




 Is this your 'I am going to pretend to be a smart person but really gonna act like a conservative' account? What is your brilliant analysis of the left's agenda? That they treat fellow humans in a more decent way than rw fundies? Dang, that's a plain awful thing right there. Damned libruls! 




 It's gonna be a fun 8 years with her as president. I don't like her myself, but man o man cons hate her. I can see why, after 8 glorious years of bill and her in the white house they ended up with bush who screwed up everything. From 9/11 to wars to recessions. 

Then a dem black man takes over and fixes the messes bush made. Republicans are just pining for those wonderful bush years again. Go Jeb.... 




 Here's the video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uY7gLZDmn4 feature=youtu.be 




 Looks like you signed up with that name just to bash ole hillary. Or troll. Either way, your argument doesn't make any sense. Hillary may be to the right of your President, Obama, but she is left of the loons running as republicans. Are you one of them 'purists' or just conservative who is pretending to be 'concerned'? 




 Well, if they are a woman, holding open a door will ruin their day from what I have been told. Benevolent sexism. Every once in a while I hold open a door or do something nice for a woman just to ruin their day. Oddly, many smile and thank me - but that just tells me they are mental slaves of the patriarchy. Or something like that. 




 Republicans are the whiniest group of people I have ever met. "WAAAH he is meeting with some human being I don't like instead of killing him all the men/women/children in a country I don't like because they don't think like me! I wanna control them. Me me me!"

That about sums up the foreign policy of conservatives.  




 This man is just too stupid to be president. 




 I was one. There were some decent folks on the force but overall there was an atmosphere of corruption and people who let power get to their head. I don't regret leaving there (back in the 80's).

Cops will stab other cops in the back first chance they get to save themselves. I was a friend with the sheriff before I worked there and became friends with the lt. of Internal Affairs (all cops hate IA....). This upset other deputies. You don't want to get on the bad side of those directly above you - they come together and can make your life hell.

We used to tie up some inmates, face down, arms pulled up behind their backs, and leave them like that 45 minutes or so till they were in so much pain they were crying. My senior officer on floor with me one night (mostly worked in the main jail) sat and watched a guy hang himself - we cut him down in time, but he told me not to interfere and let him do it if he wanted. 

There is a corrupt culture and a good old boy's network - but, yeah, there are some good cops. Problem is they fight an uphill battle against the system.  




 Depends on your personality and age. When I was a young man I read "Follow My Leader" 14 times (about a kid who goes blind - oddly enough he was named Jimmy Carter). Then there was The Dark Is Rising series by Susan Cooper.

Sci-Fi? Start with and oldie like Rendezvous With Rama - not too intense but interesting and easy read, and fun.

Just a few personal suggestions :) 




 Criminal? What has she been convicted of? I missed it. 




 Call Palin, because she could shoot at the Russians from her back porch. 




 Perhaps that is indeed the case. But at some point we have to deal with today and what is going on instead of letting either party get away with "They did it before so it's our turn to screw things up."

As a citizen I say "Yep, you both have been dicks and held up progress at times. Now get to work and earn your damned pay check and fill the positions we need. Slackers." 




 4chan: Already when back in time and told some woman she would have a baby and to name him Jesus. Then they snuck him out of his tomb later and wandered around dressed up as him.

Reddit: Figured it out and created /r/Atheism to combat their evil plans.

Tumblr: Went back in time and helped created boy bands who can't play a tune but make them feel special - which ended the real rock and roll era and broke up what was once a new, amazing band, comprised of members of The Who, Rolling Stones, and The Beatles.  




 From her FB page:

Good LA Times story about the immigration reform bills I've introduced. Two things not mentioned in the story: Legal permanent resident are being deported, as well. And not only do several states use the pretrial diversion system my bills would adopt, California did, as well, until the legislature changed it as part of the costly, failed, War on Drugs whose consequences we are still working through. 




 Because she doesn't want to see the American isis like party back in control pushing their religious agenda?

Or, maybe, she is like Romney and feels she deserves the job and wants the power that goes with it. She liked being in the whitehouse and all the attention/power it had which is why she carpetbagged a senate gig.

I don't like her myself but I would vote for her over anyone running on the right (unless huntsman were to try again). Big business will end up with the two candidates they want the most and the rest of us will pick one for them. 




 Try looking at it from the view of an investor. You put $x into a company and you push to get as much back out as you can. 

You start a company (investing your time/money) and want to get the most you can from your investment.

People cheer that on. Until the people doing the actual labor (investing their time, and even money on a car, gas, clothes) want more. Then suddenly people talk about 'greed' and how awful it is. 

Prices go up all the time because the first two groups want more. They lay off people, shift jobs to Vietnam, etc, just to grab a few more dollars. But when workers want a bit more of the wealth they are helping to create folks get bent out of shape and pine for the glory days of the early 1800's. 

All of these years of having a min wage and the right still says we are the greatest country on earth, most innovative, wealthiest country, etc. Maybe it isn't the big boogeyman people have made it out to be after all. 




 Also, worth noting, this is based off of 233 businesses. They sent questionnaires to 1000 and 233 replied. What's the over/under on businesses downsizing at anyone one time in Oakland? You can read the study at the link. Not what I would call 'well done'. Heck, it could be worse than that. Could be better. 

I wouldn't be opposed to a more Scandinavian model, tiered min wage based on age.  




 Here, let me help some folks out:

Back when we started NAFTA (and now, maybe TPP) what people tell you is "Yes, in the short term there will be job losses but long term there will be gains" (of course, the people who lost jobs back then were called lazy, etc, by the right and then when they did finally got jobs had lost seniority, etc, and so on).

Anywho...this will all pan out in the long run. More people with more money spread a tiny bit more evenly. People have whined about the min wage since I was 18 and making 3.35/hr and the country is still going strong. 




 All of the others aren't the topic of conversation right now. I actually don't watch much news (I use a twitter list w/every tv news station in the US, etc).

One might also find your posting rather spammish as you posted it, what, like 4 places at once? And you obviously agree with the content so I wouldn't guess you would be a good peer reviewer of fox news ;) 




 People don't jump on fox without cause.

It was, for fox, a decently written article. But note the use of the word 'activists' (5 times) and how and when in the past they have used that term. In the article they state: *Though Lomax is tied to the oil-and-gas industry* note they aren't calling him any sort of 'activist'. 

Fox didn't question the author worth a damn. They basically just reposted what he said without 'peer reviewing' him. Now, as far as the peer reviewing- they don't even explain what it is or how it works, which may sound silly. Until you think about this:

**The journal's editors send the article to several other scientists who work in the same field (i.e., the "peers" of peer review). Those reviewers provide feedback on the article and tell the editor whether or not they think the study is of high enough quality to be published.**

So peers review the data. And in this case, where one could make an issue with the data, is in who collected it (which is outlined in the actual paper). But that doesn't detract from the actual paper or the findings about the air samples. Other people who have done similar research reviewed the paper and found it acceptable. 

If, in fact, you read what the peers wrote you will see that they had questions themselves about some things. One reviewer states that air testing near such operations is very difficult and this is not a final answer but is valuable because it assesses areas identified by the public. All of them offered revisions and had some questions. 

None of this was expanded upon by fox, discussed, etc. Thei 'journalism' was basically reposting and asking a few pointed questions to the reviewers. Basically - typical fox clickbait that doesn't require a person to think. 




 Was the password 'Pencil'? 




 "obama WILL ban ALL your guns!"

Yeah. Never happened. 




 Ok...yeah. So? Is there a point you are trying to make? If so. What is it? 




 Betting cons will believe Iran over our president. The same cons who before were telling us Iran lies all the time. 




 You mean like in the bible, where it says you can handle them without fear? Oh wait - I forgot, god only protects from snakes, for everything else we use bullets and bombs because we don't trust god (though the right is pretty certain god will personally attack america for letting gay people marry -using hurricanes, floods, etc). 




 Yeah, I think the right is going to call for 15 investigations and millions of our taxpayer dollars to investigate this. It's the only way to be sure! 




 Cons seem to get a lot wrong. Climate. Iraq. Obama was born in Kenya. No shock that the tea party takeover has just added to their problems. 




 Being #1 doesn't always mean you're better, it could just mean a lot of people blindly listen to your crap. 

Kind of like cons probably listen to some crappy boy band and yell about how they are better than the Who ever was and proudly proclaim "My group is #1 right now, it means something!" 




 Obama told the truth about where he was born and cons are still whining like babies about it saying he lied.

Telling the truth gets you nowhere with the party of whiners. 




 *Also, what is a Koran defector?*

An ex-muslim from korea? 




 Do people there have dvd players? 




 And what I posted:
http://mediamatters.org/research/2009/04/09/media-conservatives-fearmongering-obama-will-ta/149054

None of what proposed would ban/take away all guns - which is what people were claiming. Even in 2013 he didn't try to take away guns, he supported the AWB back in 2004 (so nothing new there).

He did not try to, nor ever said he would, take away all the guns.  




 This one? Which ones was it gonna ban?

Proposed Congressional Actions

    Requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, including those by private sellers that currently are exempt.
    Reinstating and strengthening the ban on assault weapons that was in place from 1994 to 2004.
    Limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds.
    Banning the possession of armor-piercing bullets by anyone other than members of the military and law enforcement.
    Increasing criminal penalties for "straw purchasers," people who pass the required background check to buy a gun on behalf of someone else.
    Acting on a $4 billion administration proposal to help keep 15,000 police officers on the street.
    Confirming President Obama's nominee for director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
    Eliminating a restriction that requires the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to allow the importation of weapons that are more than 50 years old.
    Financing programs to train more police officers, first responders and school officials on how to respond to active armed attacks.
    Provide additional $20 million to help expand the a system that tracks violent deaths across the nation from 18 states to 50 states.
    Providing $30 million in grants to states to help schools develop emergency response plans.
    Providing financing to expand mental health programs for young people.  




 No more that I can see, can't recall every hearing of this before - since they are covering it later on the news they may update the article later. 




 This can't be right. Conservatives assured us in 2008 Obama would take away all guns. Not that he wanted to, not that he said he would, but that he would in fact do it. Not sure how, but apparently the right understands government better than the rest of us.

Then in 2012 they said the same thing, that he was just waiting until his second term to ban them all. Again, no mention of how he could but were told he would.

Apparently they were wrong. Again. And still no one will own up to the lies and hype. Benghazi!! 




 I am still waiting for you to explain your post. Did folks here like my op or not? (checks the karma on it...957) so...anyway, you were whining about what again?

I think you are just trolling, as I said before, and it appears I was right and I win. Concede any time you want -unless, as I said, you are trolling.

Either way. You lost. I love the smell of trolls roasting in the morning.  




 Ohhh, I like that :)

You threw in the whole porn thing, which is supposed to mean...I dunno, what? Maybe you are projecting here.

What the heck is a wank licker? it is obviously something you know about. Please, be an adult and enlighten us.

All this fuss over one pic - apparently you are greatly upset over it all. Please, enlighten us all as to why. All I did was post a pic from some news source and you are completely upset about it - how did this all happen? It must mean a great deal to you. I am just not sure why. 




 So sorry...but apparently a lot of other people didn't agree with you on whether or not it was an interesting post.

What - are you some sort of religious purist and you think you are the sole arbiter of what is or isn't interesting here?

Yeah...No. Maybe, just maybe, not everyone is you. There are a lot of interesting things out there that make people go "wtf?" - And your attempt to make it all about you and what you like isn't going so well. 




 Apparently folks actually appreciated my post. Why does that bother you so much? I don't get it.

I care about link karma because I actually care about posting things that people might enjoy reading. I don't care about comment karma. 

Seriously - maybe I am totally off on things. Is there something I am missing here? Why are you and a few others so upset with an interesting post? I am trying to understand it- I am just not seeing it.

I have no reason to 'defend' myself to anyone for anything. Seriously? Is your life so sad/bad that this is something you are willing to get all upset about?

Fun thread, interesting topic, and your are focusing on me in it all? I think you have issues beyond what I can help with. 




 Oh...I'm sorry...downvotes?

Is that something you personally track? How many votes does this thread have?

Yeah. And how much link Karma do you have compared to me?

Yeah. I thought so :)

You were saying? 




 It's a damned shame how people act at times :) I upvoted your reply because I think it is genuine and honest. 

It is really sad that I regret posting something I thought people might enjoy. I was gonna post it in news (where I usually post) but didn't see it as a news story, so I posted it where I thought appropriate.

Out of all the things I have posted in 2 years on reddit I don't think I have ever posted something where I have gotten so much hate. 

All over a pic...sheesh. I get why some people rant about reddit now. But - hell, I will keep doing what I do and screw the haters - it isn't like I will get a check in the mail or gold/etc anyway :) 




 Yeah...no. You're failing in that. But it's ok. 

"When I see" is a rather broad definition. I saw it in a news story, posted it. And all you are able to contribute to this thread is whining about me?

Heh. I'll give you a 8/10 on the trolling front - because I am enjoying it.

Keep trying, I think we can bump you up to a 9/10 if you play it right.  




 Where did I imply that I did?  Can you point that out to me?

I bet you can't. 




 Yeah, well...tell that to the folks over there kicking my ass for some reason over it all.

On the other hand, don't bother. I think they are either just trolling or butthurt about something.

I really don't get some areas of reddit at times. I try to find interesting things for folks, don't ask for upvotes, gold, etc, just try to post links people might find interesting and get nothing for it - and for some odd reason some want to kick my ass for it.

Meh. Screw em. Tomorrow they will forget my name and so will I lol. 




 That's so cute!

Yes, when I see a big cat dragging a shark out of the water is WTF worthy. I guess you see that each day and it doesn't elicit a response from you.

Who knew. Hey...how about you post all the pics of that happening you probably have? Go ahead...I'll wait.  




 LOL - well, apparently, some people in my thread think I 'stole' the thread from someone. I don't get it....I honestly didn't see yours or the other thread when I posted mine. I monitor about 700 news sources on twitter/etc and saw this and thought it was interesting, but a few people in my thread are on some sort of down voting spree over it all.

http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/31selr/bobcat_dragging_shark_out_of_sea/

God...I hope my life never becomes that lame. I mean, it's lame right now, but I don't go around whining about people posting something I posted (and kudos to you for not being a jerk about it).

 




 Does this one post of mine to reddit, out of all the ones I have made, upset a few folks this much?

Maybe I am not the one acting like a 14 yr old here. 




 "All (  only) things that make you say WTF." - and that pic/story made me say "WTF?" when I saw it.

So...do I understand it or do you have some other interpretation you would like to share? 




 I posted the other thread, didn't see yours at the time :) For some odd reason that pissed off a few people....Sometimes, I just don't understand the internet. 




 That's cool. You must be a conservative. How ya doing? See any good movies lately? 

You know, I have always wanted to be one of the "you people" crowd. Funny how easy it is to get such a designation. 




 Indeed, that is when facebook is forcing all the apps to change their API to new platform. 




 No, I got it from a news outlet. I never claimed it was my photo. 




 My friends at a christian bakery snuck me out through their closet :) 




 Guess not all of us lead a life where we are refreshing a wbepage every few minutes. Go you. 




 Could be. We need a full investigation - where is Issa when we need him to look into things like this?? 




 That was a horrible movie. I like end of the world style movies so I sucked it up and watched it.

Now I did enjoy The Remaining:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2714380/

It sucked, but in a Plan 9 From Outer Space way. It was a hoot. IMHO, best ever movie about the end times with a christian twist to it. Left behind was just a HORRID movie. Not even one I can watch for fun. The story line was god awful, that whole thing with his daughter, etc...good lord it just sucked so bad it made me wish the end was here. 




 I think it was caused by god as punishment against gay bakeries...or something like that.

 I don't even get what the diagnosis is. Too energetic??  




 Well, it is better on tap than from amazon :) 




 LOL. Yep. Just like Obama was going to take away all the guns (never said he would, never happened), he was gonna crash the stock market, would ignore ebola and we would all die from it....etc.

The right will believe anything :) 




 It's great in coffee. Or, uh, so I hear. 




 Yep, I was gonna reply "Gamer". :) 




 If I may:

I understand all too well the conditioning. And then there is the history, and community, and perhaps biggest of all, acceptance by others (family, friends, etc).

What you wanted, in being a wise old jewish man on a mountain, was a sense of purpose and knowledge that you thought perhaps would help not only you but also others (I don't know, speculating).

You existed in a framework. And you wanted to do well within that framework. 

Now I would like to look at it from a different view for a moment - in part because just the other night on fedflix (old govt movies) I watched a show about Jews in Chicago, made by the police department.

I ventured to guess, while watching it, that there were probably some in the Jewish community who weren't really believers (at least to some extent). But that they knew and understood the importance of culture and history and the things which tie people together. Sure - maybe moses never existed, but the traditions passed down had a net positive influence so such things were worth keeping and celebrating because of the larger lessons they conveyed.

Religion is a mufti-facteted thing and sometimes leaders see that even when they don't believe in the facts of story. There is worth in a common past, those experiences can be celebrated, understood, and carried on. Not always my cup of tea of course :)

Anyway, sorry if I am off the mark, I am personally dealing with a lot myself in this arena (though not from a jewish perspective). 




 What is it you are debating actually? That there can't be anything higher than humans? That something you can't see can't possibly exist? That the only things which can be are the things we can see and understand with our current technology?

Logically, such debates aren't even really debates. The more we learn the more we realize there is that we don't know. It would be like complaining that theoretical physicists and things they talk about are bunk because they haven't been proven. Proof requires the ability to prove things which may be currently beyond our physical capabilities. You don't discard such things out of hand but try to understand how the theories came to be, are they plausible, etc and so on.

Agnostics are the theoretical branch, imho, of atheism. 




 The point is there doesn't have to be a point. As humans we discuss a great many things and disagree on them. Sports, for example. I can easily get into a debate about the Buckeyes being better than other teams (which I have done a lot of....) when it comes to football. It won't matter in the end but people have views on things and shit happens.

Now, as to 'those who can't be reasoned with' I would tend to disagree on that in a broad sense. Sure, right now they can't, but part of that is because few challenge them directly. Popping the bubble people live in isn't usually a one time affair. But the more they see that others aren't like them (on beliefs/etc) the more their bubble is altered. 

A door opened a crack today by you could be opened a bit more tomorrow by someone else. I wouldn't say it is a goal to change the mind of people but to open the minds of others to help them better determine for themselves certain things.

Ignorance, on many things, hurts us all, and picking up even little bits of 'education' on something here and there can lead to better things down the road.  




 I agree. 




 They were elected to stop the policies of Barack Obama and the Democrat Party, Limbaugh asserted. Unfortunately, however, Republicans are making it clear that they intend on working together with Democrats and the president to get things done, particularly Obamas free trade agenda.

Ive got a lot of members who believe that international trade agreements are a winner for America and the president and I discussed that right before I came over here, said Senator McConnell, who among other Republicans, shares Obamas vision about the trade partnerships. I think hes interested in moving forward. I said, Send us trade agreements; were anxious to look at them.

Even Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has voiced his support for the trade agreements, encouraging the president to prioritize passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Speaking at the Center for the National Interest dinner in New York City on October 23, Senator Paul said:

Our national power is a function of the national economy. During the Reagan renaissance, our strength in the world reflected our successful economy.

Low growth, high unemployment, and big deficits have undercut our influence in the world. Americans have suffered real consequences from a weak economy.

President George W. Bush understood that part of the projection of American power is the exporting of American goods and culture. His administration successfully brokered fourteen new free trade agreements and negotiated three others that are the only new free trade agreements approved since President Obama took office. Instead of just talking about a so-called pivot to Asia, the Obama administration should prioritize negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership by years end.

 Let's just start a rumor that it stops discrimination against gays and prevents Iran from getting a nuke, and that Obama is 100% for it all. The right won't even look into it and organize against it, including setting up a gofundme for the pizzaparlorSuperPac. 




 So what? They are investors. They don't work, they invest their money and it works for them - the are able to finally do this under Obama. 

Of course the children, those in college, jail, etc probably aren't working, and given how racist the justice system is one can better understand the numbers (Note: conservatives don't think the system is racist at all and, in fact, support more discrimination in America against blacks, muslims, gays, etc). 

And don't worry folks - some republican will campaign on forcing those black folks into the labor force...just like, what to cons, were the 'good ole days'. 




 They like to hire people to look for acorns, shop muslim bakeries, and things like this. 




 I don't think anyone ever accused her of being very bright. Out of the dems in power there are 10-12% who are loons. On the right it is about 65%. And people keep electing both. 




 "Jesus will transform you - suddenly you will hate the poor, push for wars, seek out ways to force his words on others through laws, instead of the healing the sick you shall shame them. Instead of selling all you have and helping others you will set up venture capitalist companies and sell all others have to enrich thyself. The lord will show you that to support our troops you send them die, to support the sick you will turn the other cheek, those in prison you shall laugh at and hope for their misery."  




 Drove alone across country with only a 2 hour nap. Twice.

 Find a liquor store and some guns. Hole up there and wait for other cool people who want to drink to do the same. Party on until things calm down. 

In other words, pretty much my current life. 




 Help, help, I'm being repressed :) 




 Not sure how the two are related, except maybe in the mind of a conservative: "I support discrimination and so does Iran, why can't you treat America like Iran? Inconsistent! They are the exact same countries doing the exact same things! If only libtards were as smart us to see that!" 




 Real gross domestic product -- the value of the production of goods and services in the United
States, adjusted for price changes -- increased at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of
2014, according to the "third" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  In the third
quarter, real GDP increased 5.0 percent.

 Basically - the economy is growing under Obama, unlike under Bush - conservatives told us the economy would crash, stock market would plummet, and Obama would take all of our guns. Seems like they got everything wrong. 




 Does that include Liberty University?

 Title was from the twitter feed. 




 I can hear the conservatives now: "See, we got a republican congress and we turned things around......" 




 Hope I win. I had a pet rock once, those are like ponies right? 




 The headline is the story, what else do you want to know - what he was wearing when he signed it? :) 




 "We're bigots and promote discrimination and people don't agree with us on that being a good christian idea! WAAAAAAH" 




 The question is - would I have to bake her a cake?? 




 That was the title when I posted it.  




 Progress always wins. Look at how cons talk about Islam and how regressive it is - even they admit becoming more liberal/progressive is the right way to go.

Sadly, many fundies want to halt and roll back progression to please their god.  




 Odd, it sure seemed to be about current US politics to me. Weird. 




 Here is my problem with free trade and conservatives:

Theory - free trade will help poorer countries grow which will open new markets for the US and spur job growth.

Reality - ok, makes sense....but you forgot something.

What happens is businesses close here and people lose jobs as the first step. Then they lose their house, car, etc. And maybe, just maybe in 5-10 years more jobs will open up. All the while conservatives are yelling at people needing food stamps, unemployment, etc and calling them lazy. And, of course, they are busy union busting so when some jobs do come back you won't be making as much as you were before. 




 They think their job is to go to bat for republicans - they really don't care about the US. 




 LOL ok...now I am a muslim apologist for calling out click bait biased 'journalism'? I am pretty much an atheist and don't have any love for anyones religion. 

This is a blatant attempt from a rw source to feed the feeble minded hatred of an entire group of people that is vastly larger than the few militant idiots here.  




 So, once again, the term 'militants' is there but the headline leaves it out. 

So I guess it would be accurate for me to say "Christians sexually abuse children" when writing an article about some catholics and them covering up abuse?

Or "Christian Nation" (as the rw likes to call the US) starts a war with Iraq. Hundreds of thousands killed by US Christians in search for oil and wmd's..... 




 From the article: "Militants from extremist group Boko Haram" and the headline becomes "Muslims".

Yeah....ok :)  




 Interesting how they use the term 'muslims' here to identify someone. In the US I never see them say "A Christian did x/y/z/". I am guessing the only reason they mention it and care in the first place has something to do with their personal biases. What's next, "Gun owner shoots/robs someone?" No? I wonder why. 




 If I get my membership renewed later this week I will help you out, lvl 100 Necromancer. You just plan on farming the last section with Malistaire or the whole area? 




 Sounds like something a conservative would say. Not true and try to push fear - because, well, facts are pesky things that get in the way of agendas. 




 Troll much?

 Teacher who died in a crash. He crashed into a phone poll which allowed his spirit to tap into the internet/wi-fi - and he used the GPS to kill the guy in the car (but let his wife out first). 




 I found it interesting because a recent episode of Supernatural had pretty much the same thing happen. Someone needs to get Sam and Dean on the case. 




 Never stoop to the student level. Just break out the rifle and duct tape and then tell em you are going to go all nazi on their asses....man, I miss my teaching days, my methods were ahead of their time. Or behind the times. 




 I love the image of Iran the right pushes. Nothing about the caviar sales from there, the tourism, etc - it's like how they played people on iraq and babies/incubators, shredders, and nukes/etc. 

And why are they 'concerned' about Israel? Oh. Yeah. Jesus and the Bible. It's like our own mini isis in the US. 




 Blazing Saddles. 




 What did they do, bring him back from the dead so he could die again? Sounds like something fox would try to do with reagan. 




 But see, rmoney was being a smart business man and we need smart business to run our country just like a business - make profit, cut workers, outsource military, and if people don't like crumbling roads they can drive on someone else's roads. 




 I call it DeadBart because it seems everything is ghost written by someone who hates obama.... 




 You don't need to rally them, they will vote for any republican that hates progress, science, muslims, anyone not white and Christian.

What they need is someone to rally moderates and swing voters.

 Here, cry into my glass so I can add your tears to my vintage bottles from 2008 and 2012. I do so like a glass of those in awhile. 




 Hey, I can't stand the lady myself, but this is a witch hunt. Are you saying the state department is lying that they didn't get everything? 




 Yeah - after the emails were turned over to the state dept and the ones asked for by gowdy were given to them.

 




 So, looks like Boehner is for the TPP as well. For once there is something both the right and the left can bash obama over and the right is quiet as can be. Huh. 




 The butler with the candlestick.  




 Rand Paul, Ron Paul, Ru Paul....what's the difference. We need people with new names. 




 Soldiers have alleged (although the Pentagon has said it cant confirm) at least six U.S. troops died in clashes with the Taliban while hunting for Bergdahl after he went missing and was seized by the Taliban in Paktika province on June 30, 2009.

http://time.com/author/mark-thompson/ 




 She probably wouldn't like my Meat Loaf Mondays or our White Castles Wednesdays :) 




 Wait....what? We funded them for years, because, well, the soviets. We wanted the Taliban. Back then they weren't a 'threat'. They were tools we used. 

And I don't think back then they were going to rush into the USSR anymore than I think they are going to rush into the US. 

I am being honest here - I don't see the big threat to us. Do I think some people can hook up and do terrorist things? Yep. But hell, lone wolf folks here could do a lot more for any number of reasons. 

What, exactly, if you can elucidate on it, scares you about them? 




 Awww....look at you being all scared.

Go ahead, tell us all what these 5 folks are going to do that scares you so much. 

What IS the cost side? What is it you fear and 'believe' they can or will do? Should American's be quaking in their boots over these folks?

Apparently you think these 5 humans, out of 6+ billion, are some huge threat to our country.

Can you detail out how they are such a threat? 




 What is it people think they are going to be able to do? Have a tupperware party and plot to overthrow the US?

5 People, out of the entire population of earth. Now I am sure some might think they can come back and inspire others - but the track record here is the US kills folks like them all the time. 

Maybe the fear people have is that they will use their time and notoriety to influence fundamentalists to jihad - to which I say, I am more worried about the fundies here than there.

Where did the taliban come from? What can these guys actually offer the taliban now? Or is it Al qadea I am supposed to be afraid of now. Or Isis?

Seems there is always someone in the ME that I should be afraid of. I live in Ohio. I am more worried about the Wolverines come football season or the Spartans than some no name guy in the ME who wants to kill someone else in the ME.

Hell, for all I know there some russian guy who pines for the old days and wants to work with some of his comrades to launch a nuke. Really, I am not afraid of 5 guys from the ME who have more of a bone with countries there over Islam than here.

Perspective. We should get it. 




 As far as the last part: *How is that relevant to Bergdahl?*

It goes to the worries and concerns the right seems to have. Really. I am not scared of the people we traded for one of our own. What are they going to do to the US? Nothing. They don't scare me. If I had to put my 'worries' in some order or other, those 5 would fall below my X. Countries and people that have the actual ability to do us real harm (China/Russia) would be high up on the list.

This is about one thing - people who hate Obama and want to use this whole thing for political reasons. 

I see a US soldier, who for whatever reason, was captured and in danger. He is home now. That's one bottom line for me in all of this. I was no fan of Bush, though I voted for him in 2000, but I wouldn't have ripped him a new one for bringing home one of our own. Our soldiers face a lot, sometimes they have issues, but you don't leave em behind. Period. 

Maybe 'patriot' means something different to others. One of our own was captive. We had those guys we traded for awhile and got whatever it is we wanted from them. They were no use to us. It isn't like they are gonna rise up and come over here and whip us. Seriously, there are bigger and worse things to be scared of than them.

But it's all about politics and bashing Obama - I can find a lot better things to bash him over than this.

 




 And you can understand the hype over '5 high ranking' and 'trade', right?

We had a fellow American, a soldier, being held. We kill 'high ranking' al qaeda people every day before breakfast with drones. What, you think those 5 had some sort of magical abilities or something? Ohhh scary people we held. I mean overall, were you one of those people who though Iraq was some huge threat to the US in the first place? 

We traded some losers not from this country for someone who was a US citizen. That is a good trade all day long because I am not really sitting here scared of those folks all day long. 

I'm still more worried about the soviets their nukes because they could actually do something other than yelling allah ackbar while killing each other. 




 (*puts on conservative hat*) Why aren't we using our soldiers to do more of this? Shouldn't our kids, spouses, etc be the ones on the front lines? We need a real president again like Bush who gladly sent our people to do the fighting instead of asking others to do their part. We need to pull up our bootstraps and hand money to other countries and our fellow Americans to die and protect our freedoms from....well, crap, I don't know which of our freedoms is at risk over there right now.

Anyone know? 




 Honestly, I can't answer that. But it does bring up something:

I though Obama threw open the borders and anyone could just walk in here? I mean, republicans have basically said that - so why does this person even need a visa? Is it possible they are just fear mongering (again)?

And I am guessing that the US still has some of the best healthcare in the world on some things. Even Ted Cruz signed up for the ACA :) 




 I think we know why. Gays. God is punishing the US for the most evil of all evils. Gay people. That is why he has sent hurricanes and storms like this. 

Never before in our history have we had to deal with such storms. It was only after the commie liberals starting pushing for gays to be married and allowed to serve their country that god started this. This is why we need to vote for the super smart awesome christian republicans. They can guide us out of the wilderness and strike down the gays for Jesus.

Yeah...might be some sarcasm in that directed at the most backwards people around - Fundamentalists (who all seem to gravitate to 'conservatives' whether here or in the middle east.) 




 So what he is saying is: "Well, there have been many problems for years we blew off, but now that there is the ACA and it's helping people we want to remove it and then we will finally, maybe, do something about the problems we have been ignoring"

Whatever happens, the ACA gave attention to a problem long ignored. Progress. The right can't stop it. From allowing their fellow countrymen/women who are gay serve their country to healthcare to gay marriage - progress marches on. 




 So you wanted Obama to treat him as a criminal before he had a chance to share his side of things? A soldier came home. Now they are saying he is guilty of something. Two separate events that should be treated as such. 




 So as commander in chief you would let someone rot without definitive proof? He could have had mental issues, ptsd, who knows what and your thought is "Screw you, we're leaving you behind on the word of others and without you being able to defend yourself."

Nice. 




 So, basically, you would leave a man behind because of what some people believe? Funny how some people abandon their principles first chance they get. Regardless of how you feel the president has a duty to treat him as a US soldier in good standing until proven otherwise. 




 And he still was convicted of nothing until now. So yeah, I tend to stick to my principles even when they end up maybe not having the best result. Something it seems other are willing to ditch because they never honestly held them in the first place. 




 So you judge people before you look for them?

Hindsight is one thing, and being upset in hindsight is too. But not looking for someone based on hearsay/suspicion is something else. 




 So advisors determine guilt and innocence now without even talking to a person. Ok. Whatever floats your boat :) 




 And the right would rather leave a soldier to rot than bring him home.

It is obvious that they have totally abandoned their principles on this - but hey, remember Darren Wilson and Ferguson? They got upset when people judged him before his day in court. Suddenly they don't care anymore.

 




 They can be upset about that all day long. But they would be upset no matter what he did. If he had left him there to rot because someone said he deserted, without proof and chance to defend himself, and it came out he could have rescued him? The right would be screaming about it.

It goes to principles. Should he have treated the man as innocent first? Would you? Or has that principle went out the window because people hate Obama ? 




 I'll say what I have elsewhere. Obama acted properly and treated him as innocent until proven guilty.

Something I think conservatives used to believe in but are now ditching because of Obama. Funny how that works. Guess they will from here on out never, ever, mention the idea of innocent until proven guilty.

Had it come out that Obama had the chance and did nothing because he believed he deserted than the right would be howling about that too. 




 So you are saying Obama shouldn't have done anything and just accepted the word of others that he was a deserter, without a tribunal, hearing, etc? Without even talking to him (or having others do so)?

And here I thought conservatives had some principles on people being seen as innocent until proven guilty or at least being able to testify on their own behalf.

I am guessing conservatives are abandoning their principles right now to smear Obama. Which means they never really held those principles in the first place. 




 Reminder to the conservatives on this: The man was seen as innocent until proven guilty, and Obama acted in a manor consistent with that.

I am sure that is what is making the cons unhappy now :) 




 SO.....Let me see if I understand this. Obama didn't declare him guilty beforehand, helped get him rescued, and people are upset about this? Same people who were saying D. Wilson shouldn't be seen as guilty till all the facts come out wanted Obama to do the same for this soldier?

Ok.... 




 Stupid to apologize. The right has been 'accusing' Obama of being a muslim as though that is a bad thing. They whine about muslims in politics here all the time.

So how is it a 'slur' in this case? 




 Ah republicans -  they see others as less American and less human because of their race, religion, orientation.  




 Yeah, but we still don't know where the Ark really is. Except that it is in some desert warehouse run by the government. I bet Obama uses it for a footstool!  




 They got the ideas for fines from Cruz and Liberty university :) 




 Conservative view on this (which you can see around the web): 
"Good. Obama is evil and took all our guns. Bibi should be our president and I support any country spying on us. I hate America because the person I wanted to win didn't so I fully endorse foreign nations spying on us. We must support Israel and stop gays here or we will get more deadly hurricanes. 

We should be more like them and how they treat gays and how they handle health care - not like Obama, we need leader like Bibi to hold us cause we are scared of mooslims too! Not to mention baby Jeebus loves Israel and will curse us if we fail to kneel and serve her, Obama is a muslim and doesn't know what the bible says about us serving them!"

---Yep, that pretty sums up the rw and anything Israel/Obama 




 You have to use AT-AT's for that since they can get under the shield ;) 




 My dad's dad died when he was young. He missed his dad. That didn't mean his mom was gonna rush out and marry some guy. 

What is it conservatives are always saying? "Suck it up, pull yourself up by your bootstraps and don't blame others!"

So if you end up with two moms, one, none, whatever - deal with it and do the best you can because they probably are.
 




 Baby steps :) Maybe he is now against gays getting 'stoned' because he thinks god hates pot now and he is just confused. 




 ah yes, fear mongering. Obama will take all your guns, stop parents from allowing kids to do chores, will crash the stock market, destroy america!

Blah blah blah. Still waiting on all the crap people claimed WOULD happen to actually happen. And so far? Not ONE has had the guts to admit they were wrong and apologize for fear mongering.

Israel - beware fundie christians who want to use you for their apocalypse they dream of. 




 So...basically like your run of the mill fundies elsewhere in the world. 

"Oh, look at us, hugging those like us, helping those who profess the same beliefs. And bombing those who don't back to the stone age or being over run by our manifest destiny"

Fundies are their own countries within countries. 




 Woohoo! That guy produces more green house gasses out of his mouth than every farting animal on the planet (I'm looking at you, cows).

I hope he gets the nomination too - that would be classic. 




 According to conservatives only lazy people aren't working - that is why they want to always cut aid. So - according to them, Obama is awesome because everyone can get a job. 




 In the future we will have mated dogs to chickens, then that creation to pigs, and then that one to cows. We will have an awesome food source that gives meat, milk, and eggs all while being potty trained and able to sniff out drugs/bombs. 




 Don't we all ;) 




 Yep. Better stock up now. You could make a killing selling that stuff later. Of course, if you get caught, you could be in a cell next to bubba. "What ya in for?" --  "I sold lip balm!" 




 You seem to run around saying that a lot, and complaining about reddit in general. Maybe the problem isn't reddit.... 




 I did both. Book from the library and the librarian. Man oh man, that reference desk has everything :) 




 Also worth noting: It was national foreign language week. There are a million things to be concerned about these days. Kids learning something new about the world isn't one of them I would put on the short list. 




 Here are my thoughts. When I was in elementary school we had one jewish kid (and 2 black kids) and I don't know if any were atheist or not. But we did have fun Christmas celebrations and plays. And we also learned about Jewish holidays and did activities with that spinny thing made of clay stuff and some candle thingees....

Anyway. Being exposed to actual, real life, cultures and languages that a good chunk of our fellow earthlings are involved in I don't see as a bad thing. It's one thing to read about something in a book and another to hear it/see/etc.

I mean, which would you rather do - learn about sex from a book or from actually doing it? :)

Reality. It's outside the bubble some want to wrap themselves in. 




 No, I am just a prophet. Sometimes when I see a headline I get glimpses of the future (started to happen after sex with a leprechaun). Give it time, rw fundies will be talking about gay lasers.

More Aircraft Laser Incidents Pinned on Gay Club-Goers
http://swiftreport.blogs.com/news/2005/02/more_aircraft_l.html

;) 




 Fox headline will be "Lasers can turn your eye's blue, can they also make you gay?" Then those bright rw congress folks will get scared and try to ban it thinking gay people with laser pointers could be pointing them at your kids and making them gay.

America. Land of the free... and crazy rw'ers who believe gays cause hurricanes and punishments from an invisible sky fairy. You read it here first, gay lasers will be a thing. 




 So they want to ban women from getting ammo?
