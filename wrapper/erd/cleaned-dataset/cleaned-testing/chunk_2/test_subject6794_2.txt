 Um ... what? How is being a trans person okay, but being a cross dresser is too weird? I don't get it.

Whatever. I cross dress too, so I'd be totally into it! Sounds like a great time to me :D 




 I'm guessing I shouldn't click that link. 




 That is a really tough issue. In my current relationship everything works out because I'm not totally opposed to sex, and we're also poly so my partner is free to have sex with someone else if he wants. But we aren't married and don't have any kids, so I can't give you any perspective there.

What I can tell you is that you shouldn't feel horrible or that you're a freak. You can't help wanting to have sex with your wife - you're a sexual person, and I'm sure you love her very much. However, speaking from an asexual perspective, I probably understand your wife's situation better than I do yours. I sometimes feel guilty about the fact that my SO and I aren't entirely sexually compatible. I know that he wants to please me and share physical contact with me; that is a core part of a relationship for most people. Whenever we are intimate, I can tell that he wishes he could do more for me, but I'm just not that into sex. And then I feel bad because he feels bad, even though it's neither of our faults.

I think that's a key point here - this isn't anyone's fault. You can't help having desires, and she can't help not having them. Both of you are perfectly normal in this. But it is causing friction in your marriage, so it does have to be dealt with. If you've been married long enough that you have more than one child I assume you've probably been through a lot together, and you love each other and want to make each other happy. Start from there. Have a conversation about this with your wife. Remember that no one is the guilty party here, and have a frank discussion about your feelings. Be honest with each other. Once you figure out what each person wants and needs, you can work together to form a strategy to fix the issues you're having. This doesn't have to be a huge issue in your relationship, but it will only get worse if you don't communicate about it. 




 Exactly. This is something I've actually discussed at length in LGBTQ groups - all queer people struggle, but some gay activists try to claim that because there's no laws keeping asexual people from getting married (which of course ignores the fact that some aces have same-sex partners) and no one gets bullied for being asexual like they would for being gay or gets told they'll go to hell (neither of which are necessarily true either but it is true that it's probably not as common), aces shouldn't be considered part of the queer community. It's this mentality of "you're obviously not as openly oppressed as I am, therefore you don't matter."

Of course, not all people think that way. But ignorance like that is still a huge issue for us. Invisibility creates a whole different oppression dynamic. After all, if no one knows anything about you, then how can they possibly know your struggles or try to help you overcome them? I feel like being an ace activist, at least in my area, is first and foremost a struggle for people to recognize that I even exist. And that's pretty messed up. 




 Yeah, that can be tough. It's how life often works, though - you get unexpected reactions from people sometimes.

Whenever my roommate came out to his family, he thought that his dad's mother would be pretty understanding since she's relatively liberal, but was more afraid to come out to his mom's mother because that side of the family is more conservative. Turns out, dad's mom was really shitty about the whole thing and continues to tell nasty lies about him to the rest of the family, while his mom's mom has been his biggest advocate in the family and has actually gotten somewhat closer to him after he came out. There's really just no telling what will happen when you tell people about your identity. 




 I would say that you did. Who knows what could have happened if the situation had continued to escalate? The best thing you could possibly do is remove yourself from the situation, and in this case it was telling your stepdad to leave.

I can definitely relate to where you're coming from. I was abused as a kid, and just this past spring I had to testify in a court hearing over an issue that was completely blown out of proportion by my stepdad and younger brother. Family drama sucks, but it's especially miserable when your relationships are so incredibly toxic.

I'm glad you stood up for yourself and that your stepdad can no longer push you around. And I also understand why you feel bad for your little brother - I felt a lot of guilt for leaving behind my little sister whenever I finally escaped my family. She's twelve now, but she was only nine whenever I went away for college. I was always worried about what would happen to her without me there to protect her. But ultimately, you are your own person and you can only do so much. Your safety is the priority here, and I'm sure that if the argument between you and your stepdad continued it is very likely you or your husband or even your daughter could have gotten hurt. You protected them and yourself when you told him to leave.

Don't forget, though, that if you find out about anything bad happening to your younger brother, you can call child services. Most places have some sort of system where if they find out a child is being abused they can hold the parents accountable and remove the child from that situation. 




 One of the biggest problems with identifying as asexual is that so few people have even heard of it, let alone actually know anything about it. That's why so many of us go for most of our childhoods and even a large portion of our adult lives feeling that we're different but not really knowing why or how to explain it. I've seen people on the AVEN forums who are past their fifties and just now discovering the asexual label and community. That's a huge issue.

I can say it's definitely affected me personally, and I'm sure that others have had similar experiences. For one thing, I grew up thinking that I was a freak. I never had any crushes on anyone as a kid, but growing up as a little girl was tough because crushes and boyfriends are a primary discussion topic for girls from the time they're about eight or nine years old. I really struggled with feelings of loneliness and isolation for a long time, as well as my own frustrations that I should be fitting into the sexist notions of what it meant to be a young girl. I was constantly under pressure to worry about clothes, hair, makeup, boys ... and I hated every minute of it.

While I'm much more comfortable with myself and my identity now, I'm still usually the only openly asexual person that the people I know have ever come across. Coming out to people is so exhausting. On top of the concern that someone will reject you for being queer, you have the added pressure of explaining what your sexuality even means for the benefit of someone who has had absolutely no exposure to an entire group of people. It takes time, patience, effort, and it's a lot of pressure.

I feel like if there were at least one or two people in the public sphere that were well-known aces, in the way that there are now more and more celebrities or public officials coming out as gay or bisexual or even transgender, it would greatly ease the coming out process and other discussions around asexuality for the rest of us. Right now the conversations I have with people usually look like this:

 Me: I'm asexual.
 
 Friend: What's that?
 
 M: Basically I'm not physically attracted to other people, regardless of their sex or gender.
 
 Friend: ... That's a thing? I didn't think it was possible./How can you not want to have sex?/Are you sure you just don't have a hormone problem?/A lot of women are picky, that's okay. You'll feel differently once you find the right guy./Etc., etc.

Instead, the conversation could look like:

 M: I'm asexual.
 
 F: What's that?
 
 M: Basically I'm not physically attracted to other people, regardless of their sex or gender.
 
 F: Oh, I think I've heard of that before ... isn't [insert famous person] also asexual?

Considering how many people will deny the existence of ace-spectrum identities directly to your face after you just came out to them, having a few public roles models who are asexual would definitely help to ease some of that ignorance. 




 I've never been straight up told that I don't love my SO, but I have been told that if I did love him I should let him sexually assault me. There are some awful people out there that say stupid and ignorant things. All that really matters is that you and your girlfriend are happy, so I hope what they said doesn't get you too down. :/ 




 Really?? A gallifrey cross-stitch name would be awesome. I'm not even into DW really but I have friends who are and that is no small feat. How could anyone not like such a cool gift?? 




 I have at least 6 or 7 halfway-done projects right now ... every time I look at them I feel a little guilty but I just never feel like working on them, haha. 




 You're not the only one, haha. I'm panromantic so I'm certainly not limited to male partners, but a lot of people see me with my boyfriend and just assume. 

Yeah, AAW is pretty similar to pride month - same basic idea. It's a week where the community activists try extra hard to promote awareness of asexuality as well as demisexuality and grey-area asexuality too.  




 I don't mind at all!

I don't usually tell people right off the bat when I meet them or anything. However, whenever I'm talking to people and discussing relationship stuff (which happens pretty frequently when socializing with people), I'll bring it up occasionally. This is usually how I come out to friends - just bring it up casually as part of a general discussion. I've been lucky because most of my friends were pretty accepting of it after I explained it to them, and now I can talk with them freely about this sort of thing.

It doesn't really come up that often, though, so for a long time only a few close friends knew about my identity. So as part of Asexuality Awareness Week (which was back in October) I decided to come out on facebook. That went pretty well too, because I could just link people to stuff and they didn't have to ask me a million questions - they could go find out about it themselves. Quite a few people told me they were glad they learned something new, and a friend of mine from back in high school messaged me saying that she was also asexual and had been too afraid to tell anyone because she had a bad coming-out experience once with another friend. It made me pretty happy that we had something in common like that, and the stuff I posted gave her hope about her own future.

Since then, though, I've still been following the same method of waiting until it will be more relevant in a discussion about relationships. Also, I've had to correct people a few times whenever they assume I'm straight because I'm dating a guy, and that usually leads to discussion as well. 




 I do the same thing. I usually like to knit or crochet in my free time between classes or while listening to lectures, so I'll get 20-45 min. here and there. So a project that might take two weeks if I worked on it like a part-time job schedule ends up taking two months. 




 heterosexual romantic asexual

I think the term you're looking for is heteroromantic. And like I said in my other comment, such a relationship is possible, although difficult. If you aren't comfortable having sex at all, that does unfortunately narrow your choices. But it will probably help in the future if you discuss your identity with any future partners. That way you can both work out what you're comfortable with. Some partners are willing to forgo sex, other times (like in my case) you can have sex occasionally but not so often that you feel too pressured. Also, a lot of people (myself included) have poly relationships where their partner is allowed to have sex with other people. That solves the problem of not wanting to have sex on your end, but also your partner's issue of being able to satisfy their physical needs. This isn't for everyone, however, so you just need to think about what you want and are comfortable doing. 




 Fellow asexual person here!!

First off, I'm glad that you've figured out your identity and you're starting to feel more comfortable with yourself. Unlike a lot of other GRSM groups, being asexual is hard because there is so little known about it. Many people go for long periods without understanding such an important part of themselves because they don't even know that it's possible, or they don't have a word that describes who they are. Everyone knows what it means to be gay, but very few people understand asexuality.

It's totally normal for you to feel a little weird about this realization. Asexuality totally flies in the face of most people's conceptualization of sexuality, romance, and relationships. So it's understandable if you have some concerns!

As far as finding a partner, don't worry - it's not impossible. Fortunately, more and more people in the queer community are becoming aware of asexuality, and it's starting to come into public awareness as well. For a movement that only started in the '90s, asexuality awareness has come a long way.

That said, the chances of you finding another asexual partner are relatively low. But there are a lot of sexual people who are find with having an asexual partner. I'm currently dating a straight guy, and he's very accommodating about my identity. The important thing to remember is that open, honest communication is absolutely key - both of you need to communicate your needs and make sure that there is no pressure or resentment when it comes to the physical aspect of your relationship.

As far as coming out to friends and family, I will tell you right now that it will be hard. Again, pretty much everyone knows what it means when you say "I'm gay" or "I'm bi" but not "I'm asexual." You will likely have to explain your sexuality dozens of times to various people, and they will most likely have lots of questions. It's good that you've been looking through a lot of research on the subject already - this means that you can use those same resources when communicating your identity to other people. The AVEN FAQs are pretty handy. Also, I highly recommend [this Huff Post series](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/17/asexuality-the-x-in-a-sexual-world_n_3444417.html?1371476630 utm_hp_ref=fb src=sp comm_ref=false) about asexuality - it covers a lot of things that the FAQs don't.

Whether or not you do decide to come out, I wish you luck. Just know that no matter what happens, you're not alone, and the rest of the community is here to support you! Feel free to message me anytime. : 




 True. A lot of people don't understand the value of hand-made items. I didn't really have a materials cost since I used leftover yarn that I already had, but if I were to calculate how much it would cost by how many hours of work I put into it, that scarf would get expensive fast. 




 I realize, I just thought it was worth saying - like, this is the exception. The point is put some effort forth, right?

Also, thanks! Crafting talents certainly open up a lot of gifting options. 




 I mostly agree. Although it would be nice for personalized wrapping and notes, it's also difficult if you're buying gifts online. I'd say in that case that people should maybe send a card as well as a gift, or even a message on reddit if you're really strapped for cash. Just let your giftee know that you put thought into your gift and you care about them.

Also, I didn't spend $20 on my gift. I actually spent less than $10. But in addition to the things that I bought, I also added a hand-crocheted scarf especially tailored for my giftee's interests. So even though I couldn't spend a whole lot of money I still put a lot of effort into my gift, and I hope they appreciated it. Not everyone has a lot of money, but finding something special or making a gift should still be an option, I think. 




 There's a lot of people on the internet lately who've been diagnosing themselves or their friends with just about anything they can google. I've seen it a lot on tumblr especially.

Also, it's been more and more common in the media lately - a lot of characters on popular TV shows depict some version of mental illness. Sheldon Cooper (Big Bang Theory), Dr. Brennan (Bones), Sherlock Holmes (BBC Sherlock), Sugar Motta (Glee), etc. Of course, not all of them are entirely accurate and a lot of fans misinterpret symptoms (because not just anyone can pick up the DSM and diagnose, that's why people get degrees for it). This of course leads to further trendiness and also complete misunderstanding of how mental illness works and impacts people's lives. 




 Exactly. People who flippantly say things like "oh I'm so OCD" for wanting to be neat or "I was so depressed" about something relatively minor make it that much harder for people with actual mental issues to be understood.

OCD isn't wanting to stay organized, it's not being able to control your thoughts and being so obsessed with things you know are completely irrational but still have them to the point where it's debilitating. Depression is barely being able to muster the energy to get out of bed and go to the bathroom or find something to eat - you know, basic biological functions - because you feel absolutely no desire to do anything. You just sit there, being numb and completely unproductive, and you don't even know why, but the deeper your depression goes the more you feel like shit for being a burden on other people. These things are not fun, or minor. They quite literally take over your life.

The other one that really gets me is how autism has now made it into public awareness so anyone who's even slightly socially awkward says they have Asperger's. Being awkward does not mean you have fucking Asperger's. My brother has that. I challenge anyone who tries to claim they do to live with him for one week and then see how they feel about it afterward. Autism is not a joke. 




 People who try to claim they have a mental illness because it's trendy can fuck off straight to another universe. Anyone who does it is a shitty excuse for a human being. I share your frustration, OP - and if I were you I would not keep this "friend" around much longer. 




 I don't particularly care, as long as it doesn't start to get super crazy long because then it's harder to keep clean and you have the awful occurrence of getting hairs in your mouth during oral ... ugh. 




 I agree with Diogenes. If you're comfortable, come out to your friend and then take it from there. The easiest way to find out if he's interested is to just straight up ask. I wish you good luck, and I hope the two of you are happy : 




 My best friend is into Terry Pratchett, the only thing I've read by them is Good Omens. I'll have to ask her if I can borrow some of the Discworld books. 




 I hate when people complain about others "shaming" them for doing stupid, harmful things. If you're doing something wrong and someone points it out, that's not shaming you, it's correcting you. Ugh. 




 I never flush tampons. There are some tampons that have flushable *applicators*, but that's totally different than flushing the actual tampon. I have never seen tampons that are flushable.

Also, pretty much from the time I started having periods it's been pounded into my brain that YOU DO NO FLUSH tampons, or any feminine hygiene products, because they will clog your pipes. If your gf seriously thinks that wrapping them in tp and throwing them away isn't possible or it will make the bathroom "stinky" she's full of shit. I've done that my whole life, never had any issues. And I've lived with up to three other women at a time who also have periods. For women and no stink? Pretty sure that means it's okay. As long as you take out the trash regularly it doesn't matter. It's no stinkier than kitchen garbage - old food is way stinkier than tampons. 




 You look so great! I'm glad you were able to afford the trip and the surgery. It can do so much to improve your life :D 




 I don't care, honestly. I would be totally happy if they were friends or if they got together. But yeah, the bear feels fjdkls 




 Exactly. How often do you read a medieval fantasy book that not only has just as many important female characters as male characters, but has women who aren't super-beautiful-elf/princess/elf princess types? Pretty much never. Except for ASoIaF. So much love for GRRM. 




 FemShep is best Shep. Seriously, she has much better voice acting. It's so sad that she's been completely ignored by all the PR material for the Mass Effect series. 




 Brienne of Tarth and Daenerys Targaryen from A Song of Ice and Fire. All of the female characters in that series are really well written and varied, which is awesome, but these two are my favorites. Throughout the books you watch Dany go from being a frightened young girl who is abused by her older brother to a young woman capable of toppling cities with her armies and leading thousands of people. It's really interesting to watch her grow and struggle with love and the responsibilities of leadership. I love Brienne because I relate to her more than probably any other character in the series - she is a woman who is not conventionally attractive and prefers armor and swords to dresses and embroidery needles. Her struggles with the men surrounding her, threats of rape, teasing, disrespect, and constantly being underestimated and worrying about being a "freak," are all so real to me.

There are lots of others but those are the first two that popped into my head because I'm currently reading A Dance with Dragons. 




 Yes. It's stupid. Your feelings are your feelings, and implying that someone is moody because they're female is just a way to undermine someone's feelings. You're basically saying that "you have a vagina, your feelings don't matter." It's really sad when women say this too, because it's just internalized misogyny.

In the same vein, I hate whenever I (or another female) is angry or upset about something and some douchebag says it must be because I'm on my period. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize that I was only allowed to be angry about things while bleeding from my vagina and all the rest of the time I should be happy and perky constantly. 




 Speaking as someone else who's been through a similar experience, I realize how huge it can be to forgive someone, especially someone that has repeatedly done so many awful things to you.

I think what really made me come to the point that you have now was mostly practicality. After years and years of holding on to the anger, the hatred, the resentment, I realized that none of that really mattered. That the person I was holding all these negative feelings in for had no idea. They hadn't seen me in years; what did it matter to them whether I hated them or not? Either way, it would have absolutely no impact on their life.

I let it go. I finally figured out that I was just wasting all this time and effort and emotion for someone who didn't give a flying fuck about me, so why should I care about them? Not that I'll necessarily be overflowing with love and adoration for any of the people who have irreversibly fucked up my life, but at the end of the day *they just aren't worth the effort of hating.* That's really all there is to it.

So I forgave them and moved on. 




 Wow. I can't imagine how stressed out you and your boyfriend have been throughout this whole ordeal. It's always scary whenever you or a loved one has to deal with serious illness.

For what it's worth, I sincerely hope that you aren't positive and that your boyfriend is healthy as well. If not, then I just want you to know that there are lots of nice people on the internet who wish you well and will be here to listen, if you need it.

Much love and I hope that you and your boyfriend can be happy together, regardless of what happens. : 




 I would say that if your friend was already seriously pursuing this guy, it would be a good idea to back off. However, to me it seems like she's being pretty immature about it. Yeah, it sucks when one of your friends ends up dating your crush. But it's not like she owns him or anything. He is free to date anyone he pleases, as are you.

Regardless of whether or not your friend gets mad, I would say that you should definitely pursue this guy. You seem to have hit it off really well and if you're both interested, why not?

Obviously if you do end up together you shouldn't rub it in your friend's face or anything, but if she starts being snippy again or tries to raise a fuss over it just remind her that if she wanted to date him she easily could have asked him out herself. That's on her, not you. 




 *Extra awesome hugs*

I hope you had a great day too! And everyone else here. You guys are all awesome. Happy holidays, and I hope everybody has a wonderful new year! 




 I wasn't sure if it would accept it if the form wasn't all filled out. But I'll go ahead and do that, thanks! 




 So I've been tracking my secret santa package, and it came yesterday. Just called my roommate to confirm (since our mail sometimes gets stolen, I live in a sketchy building). I'm so happy and excited that my gift got to my house safely!!

The problem? I'm not at my house. I'm visiting relatives for the holidays. Relatives that live an hour and a half away. And I won't be home until well after New Year's.

http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130616023724/dumbledoresarmyroleplay/images/3/3d/Red_NOOOOO_Gif.gif 




 Yeah, you could accidentally end up looking like a huge ass. 




 I've been in similar situations too. I'm trying to chat with someone and then suddenly other people assume I'm flirting with them or we like each other. I guess that sort of thing is really subjective. 




 What is it about them that you find cute? Mostly physical features, or is it more about who they are as a person?

I dunno, maybe you could go with gray-a. 




 I don't blame you. It was pretty bad. That scene was certainly not for the squeamish. 









 Gotcha. I will definitely get them as soon as possible, even if I can't read them before ADWD. 




 Yes, biology can influence gender. No, it is not the only factor. And most of the division of labor has nothing to do with biology.

I'm not talking about transexuals, I'm talking about trans* people. Many of them would be much more offended by you using such an outdated and heavy-loaded word. And once again, you completely misunderstand how gender works. People who are transgender that experience gender dysphoria aren't the only ones involved here. There are also people who are genderqueer, genderfluid, third gender, agender, etc. All of the people who lie outside the gender binary fit into this idea. Many queer people realize that the way most of Western society is arranged with "male" and "female" as the only two categories is a gender construct, and they do not identify with this construct.

Also, it should be brought up that a lot of evolutionary theory in regards to sex in humans is biased and used to justify sexism. And I'm not even going to touch your last paragraph. 




 You know I'd completely forgotten about it, but Cat certainly follows her family's words quite well. 




  you are trying to spoil r/asoiaf by bringing radical sexology theory into it

I don't believe I'm spoiling anything. There is no reason that we can't apply critical thinking to the books we read and have meta-discussions about them rather than purely discussing the books' events and characters in regards to future plot development.

Also, I'm well aware of the David Riemer case. I study psychology. His unfortunate circumstances are often brought up in discussions about gender or childhood development. What John Money and Reimer's parents did to him was inexcusable.

 the theorist who came up with the idea that gender is a social construct, was proved wrong by his own empirical investigations and caused the depression and ultimate death of the boy he 'treated'

Actually, David's case doesn't prove that the idea of gender as a social construct is wrong. Assuming that this is the case completely ignores the existence of people who are trans*. Not to mention that it shows how you have a complete misunderstanding of how gender constructs work.

As far as biological sex goes, with the human species there is mainly male (xy) and female (xx), as well as many intersex people who have dozens of other chromosomal combinations. Sex is determined by genetics, and influences physical characteristics such as the development of genitals, and secondary characteristis like breasts or hair growth.

Gender, on the other hand, is the way in which people in a given society perceive sex and determine roles for its members based on those perceptions.

In other words, sex would be "this person has two x chromosomes, therefore they are female" while gender is "this person is female, therefore they have to wear these clothes and hold these jobs." Gender has no real biological basis; for instance, there is nothing in our DNA that determines men should wear pants while women should wear skirts or dresses. That is a gender construct.

This applies to Brienne, because she doesn't fit into the gender role society has prescribed for her - according to Westerosi society, she should be wearing dresses, getting married, and having children as part of the female gender role. Instead, she chose to take on a male role; she dresses in armor, has trained with weapons, and acts as a knight.

But your sorts try to convert everyone.

I don't know what you mean by "your sorts," but I'm not trying to convert anyone here, just have a discussion about what I see as a really well written character in a great book. You are the only person who is bothered by this. 




 I always thought that Cat was compelling because while she is a noble lady she is also a mother, and sometimes she puts her motherly duties before her duties as a lady. That's really what results in a lot of her rash, less well-thought out decisions; she just wants to protect her children, regardless of how it might affect politics. 




 Well I own the main five but not the other books, so I don't know how feasible that is. 




 I was wondering about all the other characters to, then partway through reading it one of my friends told me that AFFC and ADWD was originally one book and he decided to split it by characters rather than chronologically. It made sense to me, so it didn't really bother me. 




 To be fair, Brienne had to search a whole kingdom for one girl in the middle of a war. Of course it wasn't that likely that she was in the ruins, but she had to chase down the lead just in case. After all, what if it *had* been Sansa and Brienne had thought, "no that's not likely I won't even try." She had to take even the slightest chance just in case. After all, as far as Brienne knew Sansa hadn't been abducted, and even if she did know that it didn't necessarily mean she was taken to the Eyrie. After all, why would her aunt (who wants to stay out of the war) abduct her, rather than someone who wanted to use her for political gain? It just so happened that the person who did abduct her happened to go to where her aunt is. Don't mistake the fact that just because YOU as the reader know a lot doesn't mean that the characters do. It's called dramatic irony. 




 It was in Brienne VII, if I count correctly. After she and Podrick and the others got to the inn where Gendry and all the orphans were staying, Brienne went to go take Gendry some supper out in the forge. Then Biter and the outlaw wearing Clegane's helm show up, and start threatening Willow and the other orphans, so Brienne challenged them. The new "Hound" charged at her and she killed him, and that's when Biter attacked. 




 Same! The whole time I was reading the attack scene I was mentally screaming "OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD." I actually physically flinched more than once. 




 Exactly. He doesn't just show a bunch of awesome warrior ladies. He shows women who are forced to play a certain role in society because of their birth, which is really important, because not every woman can go off and be a knight. 




 Um ... yes, it is. 




 Well, there are plenty of asexual people who masturbate, or even watch porn. And not all ace people hate sex, either.

The key, though, is the attraction - asexual people aren't physically attracted to other people. So if you find people physically attractive, you probably aren't asexual. However, aces can still experience romantic attraction. So if you are attracted to someone's personality but not their body that would still apply.

That said, no one can really decide what your identity should be but you. I hope this all helps you figure stuff out, let me know if you have any other questions : 




 Well I downloaded the main ones as a set, but I haven't had the money for the other ones. :/ 




 Same. 




 I suppose that's understandable. But honestly, I don't feel like everything each character does necessarily has to have a huge impact on the entire country. I mean, a lot of the stuff that happened with Sam doesn't really have a huge impact on the main plot, either.

And sure, we know that Brienne wasn't anywhere close to Sansa. But while searching we were also able to check up on some of the other characters we hadn't seen in a while - the Brotherhood, Catelyn Stark, Gendry, Podrick, etc. 




 But would you honestly want to read pages of dialogue saying the same things you had just spent chapters reading? I would say that unless Martin had something else that was new to add, or could somehow use Brienne's dialogue to put new perspective on the events, there is no reason to watch it all happen to her and then also hear her tell someone else about it at length. 




 Ah, ok. 




 Long car trip? Yep, that would do it. I've been trying to read this book while also studying and writing papers for finals, so I was pretty much doomed to be interrupted. 




 I've definitely wanted to check them out, I was just trying to finish the main five books first. 




 Fair enough. Personally, the kingsmoot was my least favorite part of the book. I have absolutely no emotional investment in any of the Ironmen; I really could care less about their politics or who leads them. However, it will be interesting to see where Euron takes them... 




 I've been picking up the series whenever I have time to read, so this book has taken me about two weeks since I haven't read every day. But it definitely went really fast for me compared to the other books. I'm not sure if that's because it's shorter - I'm reading the ebook versions on my Kindle so I really have no concept of how physically long these books are. 




 I get where you're coming from, but I have to say I disagree. By the time Brienne tells him her story, we've already read through it. If Martin had decided to repeat the whole thing by having Brienne verbally recite it, it probably would have become tedious. Instead he just sums it up nicely for us. 




 I'm confused ... 




 Agreed, it was really cool to see all those women compared side by side and the differences (and similarities) in how they lead their lives.

I think the only part of the book I didn't like was probably the Kingsmoot with the Ironmen. That part was necessary, although relatively boring compared to the rest of the book. 




 I feel you there. Every time I hit another one of Cersei's chapters I was like "ugghhhh gotta get this over with." Not that the scenes aren't written well or important character development-wise, but she is just so unlikeable at this point in the story. I'm so glad that Jaime threw her message into the fire. 




 Biter took at least two big chunks out of one cheek as well as her ear, and from the description of the wounds that Thoros gave she would definitely have significant scarring. 




 It was certainly interesting to see a more realistic and lesser-taken approach to the knight's quest to save a fair maid story. I also appreciate that by showing Brienne's POV, Martin manages to fairly adequately show a lot of the issues that women who break the mold go through. It isn't easy being in Brienne's shoes. I can certainly relate to her character, and I hope that even if she does die tragically she at least gets a little justice before she goes. 




 Well I know I definitely enjoyed it the first time around, no matter what other people seem to think of it. It was really fun seeing how certain characters thought and felt that weren't given a lot of POV parts before, as well as giving more/new perspective for characters that we've already seen a lot of. This is the book that really cemented my liking Jaime Lannister. It might not have huge battles or massive plots but imho it had just as many emotionally charged scenes that really gave you a connection to the characters. And what's the point of having epic battles if you don't care about any of the participants? Why should I care who comes into power if I don't have any investment in the people I'm reading about? If you ask me, without those sorts of scenes the action-packed bits would be a lot less meaningful or exciting.

Oh, and I'm definitely looking forward to finishing the series so that I can finally start looking into all the conspiracy theories and whatnot. And then I'll read them all again and look for prophecies and foreshadowing. It will be a lot of fun! 




 Really? I thought they were interesting. I mean, sure, there are some slower parts as far as action and intrigue go but they were really important for character development, so they certainly weren't just filling up space ... 




 Okay, so I just finished the fourth book this morning. I gotta say, there were a lot of interesting events in this one, but the parts that got to me the most were Brienne's chapters. Hearing more of her backstory and finding out the details of all her failed betrothals and the treatment she got from the other soldiers she was stationed with was a bit of a tearjerker. Not to mention that every time she spoke to Tarly I wanted to reach through the pages into the world of Westeros and punch that guy in the face.

As infuriating as it was to read about all the shit Brienne goes through, at the same time I'm glad that Martin wrote the scenes the way he did. Some people (who haven't really read the whole series, or at least not closely) criticized him for making a series so brutally violent, and especially so for the incredible amount of violence against women. But after reading Brienne's story, I believe that Martin knows what he's doing. How he depicts Brienne and other characters' reactions to her is a rather good depiction of how gender roles are constructed, defied, and the consequences of such.

I, for one, hope that Martin continues to write his characters so well. 




 The only one I can think of is Lonely Yuri. It's mostly just really cute fluff, no actual sex on screen. 




 I agree, it's really stupid to shame girls for liking "girl stuff." I really liked the Avengers, because I'm a total comic book geek, but I also think that Love Actually is an incredibly heart-warming and cleverly written film (and one of the few romantic movies I genuinely enjoy). You shouldn't be made to feel small or lesser because you prefer romance to action. It's just a preference. 




 I applaud you, sir, for realizing the truth and being willing to speak up about it. 




 Nope. It's just a pillow - it measures 16". Just big enough to rest your head. Although you aren't the only person who wants a bean bag Snorlax, apparently. 




 Well, the yarn and the pillow cost just under $20, so not that expensive materials-wise, but it did take me the better part of a week to finish. I put at least 40 hours into it. 




 No, it happened when I was still a minor. Something like this would be ideal, but I live in the U.S. so unfortunately it doesn't help me much. Thanks, though! 




 Ok. I'll definitely post a comment here about it, and I'll try to message anyone who specifically asks so you won't miss it : 




 The easiest way would be to just use a smaller hook and a much thinner yarn. Modifying the pattern would probably take way too long. I think sports weight would probably do it. 




 Well I'm thinking about writing up the pattern, when I do I'll let you know. 




 Possible? Yes. Likely? Not really. At least, not if it was crocheted. That would take forever. Now if I was sewing it would be a whole lot easier. 




 Aw, man. Now I can't unsee it either. 




 No problem! I hope you find it as useful as I did. 




 Here's the link to [my shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Knitin8bit) if you're interested. 




 I tried to make a very happy Snorlax. After all, no one wants a sad Snorlax. 




 Hello, all! I would like to promote my shop, Knitin8bit. I just started a few months ago and haven't been doing much because of school, but I hope that it will pick up soon as I have a few things I plan on posting over my winter break!

I'm really into video games, so a lot of what I make is video-game related. Lately I've been creating items that are references to Legend of Zelda, Animal Crossing, Mario, PacMan, Pokemon, and others. I also make some anime-related items. Generally, anything nerdy is something I can get behind! I try to make things that aren't just plushies (although plushies are lovely), but also things that have some practical purpose while showing off your favorite games. For example, I've made gloves, scarves, hats, pillows, tote bags, and dice pouches in the past.

Here's the link to my [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Knitin8bit), I have a few items on sale at the moment. It's currently a mix of knitting, crochet, and a little beading.

Also, here's a link to my [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Knitin8bit?ref=stream) where I post updates occasionally about things I am working on or pictures of some of my creations that are given as gifts (and therefore aren't in my shop).

Even if I don't make any sales, I would still like some feedback from people about what they think of my products. Ideas on other things I could make are also welcome. Thanks everyone! 




 Yeah, I have that sometimes, I just pick it off and go on with my day. 




 I made this using a 16" pillow form and some worsted weight yarn. For the body of the pillow I just crocheted a circle and made increases and decreases as necessary to fit the pillow shape. For the legs, arms, and head I free-handed all of it. It's super soft and comfy, and I got a yarn that's machine washable and dryable so it's pretty kid-friendly too. If you guys have any questions I'd love to answer them!

Edit: Wow! So many people want patterns. Okay, I will definitely be writing that out later tonight or tomorrow, whenever I have time. I'll probably charge for the pattern, though - does $5 sound fair? 














 I really want to make a hood that will keep my face warm in this awful winter weather. Will be making up my own design to look like the [traveler from Journey](http://cdnl.complex.com/mp/620/400/80/0/bb/1/ffffff/4a9b343e63fcfd6377ab5bad41b450ae/images_/assets/CHANNEL_IMAGES/VIDEO_GAMES/2013/02/journey_by_warrand4t9abc.jpg). 




 While some fans of any given franchise might be annoying (as someone who is a frequent con-goer for anime related things, believe me, you have no idea how bad it can get unless you've done it too), you really shouldn't worry about other people "ruining" the fandom or how people from outside the fandom view you because of them.

Yes, there are a lot of things that have gotten hugely popular but the behavior of some people in the fan base has driven others away (Homestuck, Hetalia, SuperWhoLock, etc.) and this is certainly a problem. However, if it really bothers you that much the best advice I can give you is just don't associate with those people and like whatever the hell you want to like. You shouldn't be afraid of judgement of others for being a fan of something.

Also, as a side note, I've never had anyone look at me like a Brony for liking Hannibal. Probably because it's a show about serial killers, so I'm definitely within the target demographic, unlike MLP where a lot of the fans are decidedly too old to be within the target audience. Even then, though, I'm not gonna judge unless you're one of those Bronies that buys sex toy versions of the plushies because holy shit why. 




 If you're really worried that asking him will make you seem like you're being really nosy or that he might take it the wrong way or something, there aren't a whole lot of other options. Of course asking him yourself would be the most straight-forward route. But perhaps you can have one of your mutual friends ask on your behalf? That way if it turns out he's straight you won't have to deal with the fallout of "Oh, wait, you're into me?? No, I don't swing that way." 




 Maybe just a little. 




 [Here you go](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/17/asexuality-the-x-in-a-sexual-world_n_3444417.html?1371476630 utm_hp_ref=fb src=sp comm_ref=false) :) 




 Sexual assault is defined differently. Check the link. 




 I second this. 




 Actually, [assault](http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/sexassault.htm). 




 Unfortunately, there is somewhat of a double standard here. What you're describing is sexual assault. Sexual assault is not okay, and no one should have to suffer it, so of course you have a right to be angry. Someone touched you in a way you didn't consent to. That's not cool.

Unfortunately, while women face a lot of sexual assault because of sexism, whenever men go through it the same sexism comes back to haunt them. According to patriarchal thought, women are weak and should be sexually available for men's pleasure. So of course women get assaulted by men a lot, and when it happens it is largely ignored. But if a woman does it to a man, it's assumed that the guy should want it - because men always want sex, right? And even if they didn't, how could a weaker woman force a guy to do anything he didn't want to do?

This is one of those cases in which fighting sexism definitely benefits men as much as women. You might get a lot of shit if you complain about this sort of thing, but I hope that you won't let it stop you from doing it.

In the future, whenever a woman does this, you should call her out on it right then and there. Say "whoa, why are you touching me?" Tell her that's not okay. Because it isn't. And not doing anything when it happens reinforces the idea that sexual assault is no big deal, or that unless someone does something that leaves you in the hospital it isn't REALLY sexual assault. This is definitely a problem, so don't be afraid to stand up for yourself! 




 Depressed? Perhaps not. Personality disorder? More likely. 




 I don't think that wanting to get this guy out of your lives is partriarchal. It's wanting to get rid of someone who is increasingly becoming a source of stress, frustration, hurt feelings, and emotionally manipulative behavior. I'm not sure that straight up banning him is a good idea, because your wife seems to be a bit starry-eyed about the guy and might rebel against it just as a knee-jerk reflex. However, I would definitely suggest that you talk to your wife about this. Holding in your feelings isn't helping anybody.

You should tell your wife how you feel. Don't be pushy or judgemental about it. Just tell her that you think this guy isn't that great for her. Explain to her calmly why. Tell her that if your positions were reversed you would want her to tell you that you were in a bad situation. Tell her that you're concerned and you can't deal with how the emotional turmoil in her relationship with this other guy is affecting your marriage. Great sex is fine, but it's not worth wrecking your other relationships.

I hope that you can help your wife see that this dude is just toying with her. We've all been in situations like that, where someone pulls the wool over our eyes. But this guy is not healthy for her, or for you. 




 I wouldn't mind if they said hi or waved to them, maybe exchanged a few pleasantries to be polite, but if we're on a date you should be focusing on me, not someone you're no longer dating. Say hi and move on. 




 Honestly, though, even if someone was doing self-harm to get attention I don't think they necessarily need to be bashed for that either. If they are that desperate for attention that they feel the need to cut themselves, they're obviously a little fucked up and they need to seek help from a therapist or something.
