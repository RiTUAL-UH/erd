 That knife is worth more than $20... 




 Should of had a better best man.  




 Watch TV, golf, and eat out all the time. Oh, we both have new cars.  




 THIS MAKES ME SO ANGRY!  




 I'm now survivor ready.  




 Robin.  Sorry.  




 I was waiting for her to throw or drop it, to show how easily damaged our brain is.  I was disappointed.  




 Batman and Robin.  Batman Forever was bad enough to demand a reboot, but the pushed it one more time.  Batman and Robyn will be forever known to me as the worst movie ever.  




 Blow jobs 




 I find it hard to feel sorry for people who made millions then blew it all.  




 Women drivers  




 This is what i tell my wife all the time.  That and the speech from Team America World Police.  There are three types of people in the world; dicks, pussys, and assholes.  I'm a dick and i feel responsible to fuck assholes who think it's on to shit on you pussys.

She doesn't agree, but it's been 5 years, so i think she's at least accepted.  




 What is wrong with you?  Do you only like happy cartoons?  




 Leaving Las Vegas  




 Did i miss the funny?  




 The kid was a dumb thug.  The cops testimony isn't that hard to believe.  The evidence backs it up.  Blood in the cop car, kid shot at close range.  




 So, what about people that aren't homeless or in prison?  Is there a genetic predisposition to being gay, but there needs to be the triggers in your life?  Similar to people that suffer from addiction?  I've always figured everything in life is a mix of nurture AND nature.  




 I've always thought this was more the case with gay men.  Of course some women become lesbians, even gay men think women are attractive. It's sex with them that scares them.  




 So by that logic, a person who is constantly scorned by the opposite sex, and accepted by their sex, could develop long term "gay" feelings and behaviors?   




 I got an idea.  Everyone there hates the police, so the police should just leave.  Let the towns people protect themselves.  




 One study last week said it proved it was genetics, now this study is suggesting it's a learned behavior.  Nurture vs. Nature rages on.  




 Never worked in a shop?  Oil and air.  




 A beautiful American history lesson from JizzBomb. 









 Literally, unbelievable.  




 Fuck that lady.  I'll drive slow in the left lane, be reckless and film the guy I'm blocking, then laugh when he crashes because I've forced him to speed past my self righteous ass.  




 Fuck more women 




 This should be at the top of the list! 




 This man is my new hero.  




 Did he take the charger? 




 ITT: no shit  




 Police don't just show up and start harassing people.  Something had to draw their attention to said person. If that person then was polite, respectful, and didn't question authority and act like they know the law/their rights, then unless you are breaking the law, the cop will go away.   I've always been polite and respectful, and i always walk away.  My friends tend to mouth off and make sudden movements, and end up in jail. 

Is it right?  Fuck no.  Fuck the police, their agenda, and their corporate masters.  But, i like my "freedom", so when i see a cop, i do my best to be John Q. Public Taxpayer,  and i suggest you do the same.  




 Yes, fuck you.  Safe distance is half a car length, at any speed.  




 Why would we want to buy a tank from the French anyways?  Maybe we were being polite...  Look France, it's not your tank, it's us. We just don't understand, but thanks anyways.  




 These are all mostly designed as a one time use part.   




 Your suspension components.   But sure, drive that thing in, techs need to eat too.  




 Women drivers 




 False.  Porsche 356 pre A. 




 I was once told, you may be able to buy a used Mercedes, but you can't afford to maintain one.  




 Funny, i feel the same.  What's even more funny is i always considered Daft Punk to be an EDM type "band". 




 My wife votes Democrat, and i vote Republican, so now we both save time and neither of us vote.  




 How exactly does one, suck a fuck?  




 Bad luck Brian.  Turns found gun over to the police.  Gets arrested when gun comes back tied to a double homicide. 

Remember,  possession is 9/10 of the law and police don't care who did it, as long as they can arrest someone.  Hopefully it won't be you.  




 This is why 4, 5, and 6 are far better than 1, 2, and 3.   If you take that much time on the models and special effects, you're going to put as much effort into the story and charters.  1, 2, and 3 were beautiful c.g.i. effects, but had no depth beyond that.  




 What does something that happened a hundred years ago have to do with a guy getting jumped by three black guys?  




 Roland 




 Holy shit, i live within 15 miles of there!  I'll be visiting soon.  




 That's the problem.  Engines and oil are getting better, so they tell people that you can go longer in between oil changes, but we still use paper filters.  I don't like going past 5k.  




 No, it's still bitching and he still sounds like a dick. 




 This. I've interviewed close to 50 people and it bugs the shit out of me when they are half an hour early.  I feel that is worse than 5 minutes late.  I'm a busy guy and I gave you the appointment time for a reason.  Last guy showed up while I was still eating my lunch.  =/ 




 Worst. Porn. Ever. 




 Well, that's disappointing.  




 Problem is, too many people drive like thoughtless idiots, so they walk the same.
