 As an average man who has been crushed by his single cat being hit by a car, I can attest to this. 




 While your *science* is right, you left out the main ingredient to pegasi, dragons, and large beards: magic. 




 Yeah, I generally use it for CQB, but I like how it can handle targets at range effectively if you know what you're doing. The P90 and MP7 and worthless past anything other than buildings, otherwise I'd be using the MP7 everywhere. 




 SEAL Team 7 has a clan server up. When we are in, we keep it in good condition 




 Oh ok, forgot that variable. Thanks for making it known 




 First of all, llama and infectios, your posts are not helpful and annoyingly pointless to the post, please read the reddiquette.

In regards to the post, I think the beacon would be overpowered if everyone could spawn on it. Imagine if all 12 soldiers or even 32 spawned on it at once. It would be extreme mayhem. The idea would be cool, helpful, and useful, but way too powerful. They would have to put a security measure on it, like a half second or full second spawn delay between each spawn if they made this possible. 




 It released the 4th with premium in the US. Where are you located?



Edit: they were unplayable from a bug for like a day or two however 




 I suggest you buy it for xbox. Comparing pc to console is like comparing apples to oranges, simply uncomparable. That being said, buy a good gaming pc later. premium is more worth it now than it will be as more dlc releases, but pc gaming can be more fun. Its really up to you. 


Tl;dr - Buy premium now on xbox, then pc later down the road for other gaming frontiers 




 He mentioned jets, but his post mostly concerned helicopters. You only have rockets in a helo if you're an AA pilot, so we need pods to do something. Read the post better next time before you make a fool of yourself 




 I was about to post a thread there, then thought, there are more interactive andy's on BL then intelligent people, so I came here haha 




 My main gun is the PDW-R, and I use it on medic or support mainly because I'm pretty bad with rifles and completely trash with LMGs. I'm great with carbines and snipers, otherwise id use it their too.  




 Yeah I saw that text shrink as well. He literally bumps his troll posts if they're stagnant for an hour to get the responses coming. Its so sad. 




 Yeah, I saw the troll post. Of course his kdr and skill are high, he hides in the back while getting mav kills only. No deaths means no drop in skill.  




 The last 30 seconds were most gripping, as I expected the soldier we were following to get knifed by the recon near the end, so they could share their remorse.  




 Yeah, this. I tried to record some footage back in the alpha so I could give feedback, but my super powerful pc was incapable of playing and recording simultaneously.  




 I was exaggerating, but 3 or 4 is less than 6 to 11. It must have just been the very few times I was playing that it happened 




 It only takes like a single bullet to kill people on hardcore lol I think the thing that turned me off to it was the stupid blueberries not realizing that there is friendly fire, so I die from my own soldiers constantly. Super off putting 




 I never really play hardcore. Idk why. It's not like it's too difficult, it's just less fun for me. You enjoy it more?

 Never used the extinguisher, but that's because I thought it could only be used once. Is it pretty useful now? 




 Surviving within an inch of life after an epic slaughter... These are battlefield moments that I play for 




 These are the moments when you feel good, like you're a true, skilled soldier. Good feel 




 Are you in my clan? We feel this way everyday haha 




 After playing close quarters with conquest domination, capping a regular conquest flag feels like the microwave minute from hell. I know the feeling 




 I would like to hear any of your more unusual moments where your first reaction drenched you in the fear that you would soon meet your demise, but your valorous Battlefieldian mindset brought you through to victory. Here's mine:

Today I was capturing point Bravo on Caspian Border, when a large tree on the C side of the capture point was knocked down somehow. The tree pinned my soldier so I could run around between the branches, but I was trapped within them until it disappeared. In all of my long hours since the game released in October, this has never happened to me. Meanwhile, through the brush, I witnessed a jeep with two men drive up, and a third soft target following close behind. I quickly threw on my big boy pants, locked and loaded, and screamed my war cry as I fired on the jeep's driver first, killing him, then his gunner, with a few (probably lucky) shots. The third man discovered my hideout but I used my prison to my advantage, using the branches as a shield, successfully luring him one way so that I could shoot him in the back and rain victorious, just prior to the tree vanishing. I successfully held Bravo while hiding in what I had assumed would be my grave, and now I want to hear your stories. Anything is fine, but preferably the strange. 




 Thank you, this sufficiently answers my query, and it makes perfect sense. I doubt uTorrent cares enough, or is even capable of showing a more defined graph, one which would support to what you are referring. Good enough for me.  




 I can watch the graph update every second. Does it calculate it in reference to the prior speed? Or through some other equation? If what you're saying is true then the graph it supplies me while it's downloading the torrent is a farse, and it's not showing me real speed data.

The way I'm making sense of what you're saying, is that when the transmissions are interrupted, the speeds decelerate, which is why they fall, until they can connect to another peer, where they begin to lift again? Let me know if this is a completely false assumption. 




 The last sentence sort of answers my question. I suppose that make sense. Dropping and picking up peers would appear to cause that, except the slopes are pretty defined over proper intervals, so there should be more to it than that.
