 OMG!! This is better than anything I have ever heard before. I would put this mix in the same bracket as D B mixes from ANDY C, Fabio, Zinc and Lambshank. 









 The original is terrible for Swedish House Mafia standards!

 Thanks for all the great responses guys. I think setting up my own business would be a bit too extreme for me. I think the non-immigrant "b" approach with the visa runs sounds like the best idea. Maybe getting a TEFL before I go out is an idea. Or I could work illegally??  




 Hi guys my girlfriend has recently been given a conservation job in Thailand. I am hoping to join her maybe for as much as a year. I would like to travel a bit as well as some local employment to keep funds going. I've looked into visa's and work permits but it seems a little confusing and would like a little advise on it. I am a British citizen.

 Can I get one that says  "Elevated Earache Pt III" 









 That wasn't a miracle. The only act of God was the avalanche. God tried to kill this man, but thanks to technology and his friends he survived. Man - 1 God - 0
