My family knew it straight away, the scream was pretty loud.

 Here's the thing though, they don't dodge, they just kinda run into you guns blazing.

 "Soldiers hate him!" 




 I would leave if they did anything to my precious Liberty Launcher that isn't a buff.  
  
I would go back to MGEing with my friend if the Shotgun got a nerf, he's a bitch with that thing doing 75 damage like every shot, Valve please remove kebab 




 They move like a texas rattle snake, they strike with no fear or remorse, they will never back down from a fight. These players are always destroying me, when I see a Heavy, it's game over. A Pyro? Dead. You could argue that I should just move away and flank them, but they will never. Stop. Coming. It's been an ordeal, especially when there's a Medic shoved firmly up the rectum of the Heavy. Does anyone else fear these... These, *monsters*?  
  
Edit: I woke up this morning and had like 500 mail. I got really scared until I saw this on the front page. 




 Just a Reddit tip for the future, using a " ^ " symbol will do a thing ^this ^^is ^^^the ^^thing  
  
Add in multiples for smaller text, that's why your smiley face is a Demoman :] 




 Maybe you'll see me, maybe you'll see my spikey shield, maybe you'll see my Pan, you can never really know what to expect when it comes to pro players such as me. :] 




 "ICH BIN I JUST KICKED YOUR ASS!"  
  
Then put Medics Killed and Medics with full uber killed strange parts. 




 Glad that you asked, I actually found that I have become a better Engineer from the experience, with the knowledge that the Chargin' Targe is the weapon that takes the most skill, I know to only fear the Shield using Demomen, I don't even sweat when I see anything that isn't a shield.  
  
I also have become a better Medic, the reason for this is that I know that only a skilled player could kill me with the Targe, it's really just about the confidence that I obtained when I got that kill. 




 [Sure] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440_2_3383129766) 




 I personally tried out a B.A.S.E. Jumper/Cow Mangler set a couple days back, the idea was simple, Alt fire to jump high without descending by being on fire, then RAIN HELL. It worked about 300x better than expected.  
  
Although I guess 300 x 0 is still 0...  
  
Anyways, what stupid loadouts do you use that you have done well with? 




 You win this round, Mista-Smitty-Waberjenmansen, but I shall return as #1!

 I got kicked for saying "Medic is noob class don't even kill anyone" whenever I heard someone say we need a medic, then I got called a hacker so I spammed "B" and "N" which are my LMAObox spam binds. I got kicked.

Very important, very TF2 related question: http://strawpoll.me/4173377  
  
So yeah if you could go ahead and answer a couple of these, mostly the first two, that'd be great 




 ??? 









 The rocket launcher mostly is based on splash damage, removed by the Direct Hit's stats, you need to literally get direct hits to do anything with that. The Grenade Launcher, however, is based on mostly direct hits from the pills. The shattering pills from the Loch aren't as bad as the Direct Hit's rockets that basically shatter on surfaces anyway.  
  
TL;DR, this isn't really that long so not reading it just kinda makes you lazy if I'm being honest, but pretty much the play style for Soldier changes to being direct rockets and Demo's doesn't because direct pills are his thing I guess. 




 My friend was playing some TF2, can't remember the map, I think it was ctf_well, and I joined on an alt account to start pissing him off by doing dumb things like whacking his sentry when I'm not an Engineer or building right next to him because he HATES that. So I'm doing that and then I guess I walked onto a metal spawn or something because he starts talking to me in the Skype about how a Soldier took his metal. So he picks up his dispenser and says "No. This Soldier is not using my dispenser." So I walk into him as a medic and start calling for a dispenser, he gets pissed and starts to call a vote kick on me, I plead in the chat and say it's my third game and that I'm sorry and I will try harder, I stay in, but he still wont let me use the dispenser, he picks it up every time and while that's happening I need to pretend to be on Reddit laughing at something. Eventually I stop and leave him be. Until a Pyro comes and sets everyone on fire including me. At that point I stood next to his dispenser spamming thanks while other people enjoy the heals. He picks it up and burns to death. I think it was worth it on his end. 




 I got a 23 on my math test, I assure you! I-uh, totally got a 23 on something unrelated to the button! 




 You got me, it's actually about the yellows! 




 This is about the gray flairs what does mine matter for?

 This is one of the things that just screams "Fake". Or at least I would hope it does. 




 You've not been touched by the Based God yet, hopefully some day you will be blessed by Lil B  




 One time I was typing and I heard a DR spy decloak, on instinct I hit enter and sent the message of "I still think Lil B is the be" then turning around to crit pan the spy then get LITERALLY 3 CROCKETS INTO MY COCKET! 




 That is uhh, absolutely unique and not painted. I don't understand. How is the Slick the only thing that's done this? 




 I never take baths!

Supa hot fire.  
DON'T FORGET THE SUPAHHHHH! 




 Can you link us your backpack so we can see it? Don't worry about if you made a mistake and realised that it does have the paint, I've made that mistake before too. 




 It's more convenient sometimes, and if you're facing a Medic who [masks uber] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78inJ5Kd9Y4) it does help

 If you want to be silent and get some free kills, play Spy. Unless you're on the opposite team from me, in that case you can keep on doing that.

 This is amazing and my favourite taunt, can I have your permission to make this my Steam profile picture? And if you don't win I can give you mine, I'm always happy to share a cup of coffee with someone 




 I just spent like 3 hours drawing something and it didn't save so I had to redo it quickly [Shotgun 3](http://i.imgur.com/O7j3MIW.png)  




 Gibus and Duffelbag are irrelevant, the fast learner is funny though 









 Then use the power of steam pics 




 The name changers aren't hard for me to kick, if "UIgjjjYGK5256" is hacking and I can't see him in the kick screen, I can assume that "KbilLLfyh*712(* " is probably the same dude, and if he's changing to people in your team, ask the real one to kick him. 




 B-bison, a joke weapon? What? 




 Alright just making sure, the community market is around 300,000,000% "GIVE ME $300 FOR THIS HAT BECAUSE I WANT CASH!" 









 It almost looks like you dived out of the way at the perfect time 




 You're right, that's when the hot fire comes from me and the air comes from you!
