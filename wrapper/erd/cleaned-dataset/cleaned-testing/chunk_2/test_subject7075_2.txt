 I've had similar things happen to me. It's strange that you mention swimming lessons. I used to dread going to my swimming lessons when I was young (for some unknown reason).

The phone then rang a couple minutes later saying the lesson was cancelled. As you said, these feelings passed as I grew up and became more confident.

 I know you asked for books, but you should search for Paul Sellers' YouTube channel. He is very informative. I really enjoy watching him.
