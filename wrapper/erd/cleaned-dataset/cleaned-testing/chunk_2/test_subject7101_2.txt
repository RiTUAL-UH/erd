 watching a old video clip and bringing someone back as a hologram after death is completely different 




 they didn't give the ok to be used as a hologram after death it's different from old recordings and clips etc.. 

the family giving the ok is not the same.. let people rest in peace there is no need for holograms 




 they are the ones that would have to ok it in the first place they could sue otherwise 




 enough with these holograms!!! first 2-pac then Micheal Jackson and now Senna

i can't support this because they are dead they get no say in it (sure the family or whatever gives the ok but not the actual person who obviously can't)

let them rest in peace 




 it's like they think Ferrari is sitting around not upgrading their car at best they'll be able to compete with williams 




 if i'm not mistaken they have like 10 tokens left.. how much do you think they will improve this years car?

will they be able to match Mercedes on pace rather than adopting an alternate strategy

Raikkonen said in an article after yesterdays race that he thinks this will happen.. hopefully it's true 




 cheers.. these streams are pretty shit today keeps cutting out 




 Renault provided a gigantic turd of an engine 




 what did he say my stream keeps screwing up 




 i don't expect it to be any better next year 




 got a feeling rosberg will take hamilton out 




 yep it will be another hamilton rosberg vettel podium unless the mercs chew the tyres like Malaysia  




 hard to pass cars when the car is powered by a gigantic turd 




 massa has electrical problems? 




 he's using any excuse he can think of 




 going to guess it will be a Hamilton Rosberg Vettel podium 




 get used to this podium it will be like this all year 




 it was boring and a sign of how the rest of the year will be

some teams are struggling to even finish a race.. Rosberg doesn't have what it takes to challenge Hamilton, the Ferrari's have improved but not enough to pose a threat to the Mercedes and we have yet to see a good vettel kimi battle because something always fucks it

williams not good enough to keep up with the ferrari so we can expect the same results each race 1.hamilton 2 rosberg 3 vettel 4 kimi 5-6 bottas/massa
 




 so for the rest of the year it's going to be 1. hamilton 2. rosberg 3. vettel 4. kimi then the williams 5-6 and so on 




 another boring race.. Malaysia probably going to be the only interesting race of the year if it stays like this 




 it's on of my favourite maps what i'm saying is it's annoying to have it voted for several times in a row or only have 1 or 2 different maps inbetween playing it again 




 its like some people just can't get enough of it that they have to constantly vote for it a gazillion times

just played a few rounds of casual for fun and dust2 was voted for 3 times (twice in a row) happens every day

maps been out for like (15 years?) you would think people wouldn't want to play it every 5 seconds

 




 he'll be kicking himself for it the ferrari is vastly improved from last year and McLaren is pile of shit 




 alonso will be kicking himself now for leaving ferrari.. McLaren look like they will have there worst season ever and the ferrari seems a lot better then last year 




 this had better not be how the rest of the season is utterly boring race 




 the issue is the crap engine in his redbull he'll be lucky to get a win this season with that Renault turd powering his car 




 time for redbull to get a different power unit the Renault is basically a gigantic turd 




 the redbull seems to be a powered by a pile of shit 




 it's going to be a Mercedes dominated year again so i think it's going to be pretty boring all year round 




 even so he really shouldn't discuss/show things like that in the first place as it's a review

they are not supposed to reveal plot twists and endings 




 they need to make the movie appeal to both rooster teeth fans and neutral people (who may not even know what rooster teeth is)

if it's just a movie full of RT references and in jokes it won't be successful  




 this is more then 5000 people i think it's grouping all  players together

saw a post on the gameloft forum where someone tested a low score and got 29,434th place

this happened on a event before and they never fixed it 




 was going to post something similar unless you run a ben riley you are almost certain to lose your combo in the high rise area

hate it with a passion 




 well that sucks 




 just noticed the new event so had a quick go  got 1.6 million on my first try (died because of a stupid mistake)

i thought that would be good enough for a decent position that i could work on later.. nope 360th place don't even want to kow what the top 50 scores would be

1.6 million in previous events would of got into the top 100 no problems seems now you got to get over 4-6 million to place well 




 that's why they should come up with something to keep people occupied that isn't 30 day long events one after the other

they can't keep this pace up forever 




 they are far too greedy for that they would much rather release several 200 clam items every event so people have to buy several $100 clam options to have everything

personally i wouldn't spend $100 on a mobile app even if it gave unlimited clams i play this game for 1-2 minutes maybe 2-3 times a day.. not the same as spending $100 on a PC/console game that will give me 100's of hours of immersive gameplay  




 i uninstalled simpsons because of it family guy might go soon as well as it's just getting tiresome if you want anything decent for the game without paying the ridiculous prices they charge 




 it will be another copy paste event you can't make something unique when you are put events out one after the other 




 got another score of 2.4 million luckily this one registered so i'm in the running for the 50 iso 8 prize 




 i'm a little burned out on this game atm

king butt, comic con which went for 40 days then Halloween and now american dad to me that's far too many events in a short period of time

once this one finishes they'll likely have a Christmas one as well

game needs some downtime between events maybe release a new district or have smaller weekend things like they used to do not month long events one after each other 




 this only seems to happen to me on my best runs and ones i use ISO-8 to continue on

i just scored 2.6 million on the daily run and game decides not to register it i even used 6 ISO during the game

game is more than happy to take the ISO and not register the score

seriously getting over the glitches this fucking game has (not to mention the lag)

restart of phone etc isn't making the game register the new score

don't have screenshots because i shouldn't have to take them after every run in case this BS happens. 




 a lot of people make far more vials then they can ever spend

i average 800 on a bad run and over 1000 on a good run playing 5-10 times a day you end up with a lot more vials then you can ever spend

they should add a mystery box for like 100k vials that you can win ISO or portals or something 




 this happens to me a lot and it's annoying 




 progress rewards are 2500 vials and 1 iso 3500 vials 2 iso 10 iso and last prize premium portal and 10 ISO

the entire event (and leaderboard) is based on how many enemies you can kill.. 

doens't matter if you score 20 million it's based on the amount of enemies killed

not sure who gives the bonus if there even is one... i've got 80 enemies so far and i'm in 486th place don't play often enough to score higher in events like these 




 i try to use my highest level spiders with a bulletproof as the main one due to the abilities of near miss and extra points from enemy kills.. 

my multiplier is 33 and if i have a good run i can get around 2.5-3 million average runs if at least 1 million

other then that it's just down to luck.. only use ISO to continue a run if you are sure you can get a higher score for a good prize otherwise it's just a waste 




 the new event didn't register my score of 4.7 million to the leader board

it knows i got 4.7 million because each time i die it says best score of 4,7 million but it never went on the leader board fucking pissed me off

all scores i get know go up but just not my best one 




 the event isn't registering my scores got 4.7 million but it didn't register

fuck this game has been really glitched recently

edit-- getting a message leaderboard data unavailable that might be why it's not showing 




 it designed to make you want to spend money to get it quicker. otherwise you just have to wait and get them from premium portals which all depends on luck

just score enough to get them on the daily leader board or try to get 50 iso-8 and buy the discount ones or get them in events

no way in hell i'm spending 800 ISO to rank up my 5 star bulletproof one 




 i was thinking about this because right now in issue 4 it's already requiring higher then level 70 to continue

the later issues will probably go higher then level 90 as they already have a 7 star in the game

hopefully they release all of them as 7 star otherwise it will be a pain in the ass to rank one from 1 to 7 star 




 yep changed back on andriod as well although i somehow managed to get the bronze prize yesterday and got 50 iso-8

i don't even remember making a 2.5 million run in unlimited mode but apparently i did and it was enough for 50 iso-8 




 android daily rewards have changed again no more premium portal

the 4th price (1000-9999) is 5 ISO-8..

sucks when it's 12 for a discount portal.. i relied on that portal as i've been a bit low on ISO lately (even though it gave me spiders i didn't need)

if i'm lucky i'll be able to get 8 or 9 ISO a day 









 it's hard to say what it is as the number needed would increase everyday as more people get better spidermen

the premium portal prize 1000-9999 used to only need a score of 300k now it's increasing to 450-500+
