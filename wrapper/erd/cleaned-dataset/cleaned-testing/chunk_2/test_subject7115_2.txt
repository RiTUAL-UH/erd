 I got dumped a couple of weeks ago for the first time after 8 months with my first ever boyfriend. I had never been in a relationship with anyone before, nor had I done things with a guy so he was my first everything. I even ended up giving him my virginity because I thought I was ready. I don't regret it. But I just still have a lot of emotion towards the breakup and keep trying to tell myself I'm past it but it really hurt my self esteem. I'm a bigger guy and so it was hard finding my first relationship and took a lot of time and hard work. I'm 19 and I just can't figure out how to get past it and rebuild myself. All my confidence is gone and I don't know many other gay guys to ask. Please be nice. Thanks. 









 Exactly. 




 Those feels. They hurt. 




 I upvoted because you're cute 




 The red brick road leads to death, disease, anguish and sadness. There's also cookies and milk. 




 Do I see egg clusters from flies or just puss? 




 I don't get it. Is it wtf because its the same? 




 Yummy! That hair! ;) 




 How did it happen? This makes me so sad.. 




 WHAT?!? 




 He can keep playing with those joysticks he has. I'll take the one in his shorts. 




 This is fucking hot 




 Stalin had an iconic mustache yet people still wear the style and he was worse than Hitler and killed millions more than the Nazi's did. Sadly, I admire his mustache. 




 I'm gay and I just got pregnant. I'm scared but I'm keeping it. Take that nature! 




 This is how I feel on all three dating sites I'm a member of, and in real life when I ever get any courage to try and ask anyone out. 




 He gets me all sorts of hot and bothered 




 Decomposition. You'd look like this too if we left you out somewhere to rot. 




 A woman who fucked up cooking?! This is an abomination! 




 Nothing funny about this but damn they're hot! 




 Did you think it meant January 1913? 




 I'm assuming you think that flesh colored thing right under the kangaroo is a ballsack. You're blind. It's a foot. Otherwise, what the fuck are we looking for? 




 I ain't saying he a gold digger... 




 Buddha hand. They smell fantastic. 









 So jealous! 




 Hot damn! 




 Totally a bag from a box of wine. I've done it at parties. 




 Can I marry him? 




 Dark Helmet from Spaceballs. Very nice. Love that movie.

 There is nothing significant in this photo 




 I think he's trying to get into porn or he might have already done so. Anyways, he's fucking attractive now. 




 Ahhhh, Hispanics 




 I think he likes you. With his penis. 




 I honestly thought this was a man who had put on fake boobs. 




 It actually is a legitimate photo taken during a paranormal investigation of the Amityville murder house. It was taken in the 1970s. 




 Yeah, with no explanation your picture makes absolutely no sense. But since I now know, I can say she's stupid. 




 Agreed 




 Nice makeup. It looks good...but obviously not good enough. 




 Try posting a picture of your mother. Wait. That's what this is. Never mind. 




 Could help with sex 




 I'd bang 




 How about attention whore who probably has daddy issues 




 Looks like Amanda forgot to clean out her locker. 




 Just broke up last night. I can't wait until I no longer care. 




 He looks like Wall-E. 




 It's all a matter of food distribution.  









 I did too. And I'm a man. 









 No. Too late. It's been posted quite a bit already. 




 It's a repost. Trust me. I made the same mistake... 




 There are people with thyroid conditions which causes them to gain weight uncontrollably even though they have a healthy diet. 




 Apparently someone already put this up. I didn't see it on here so I thought I was the first person to post it and then learn that someone beat my by an hour. Dammit. So I have to call my own post a repost. I'm so sad.. 














 I agree. It looks pretty good. 




 She didn't choose the wookie life. The wookie life chose her. 




 Where do people get all these photos of my family?! 




 Last year when I spent Halloween in College Station, I got into two car accidents with the same car and had it break down. Then proceeded to push it half a mile into a parking garage. The car was also covered in puke. The worst part about my night? I was sober. 




 Dammit grandma! I said later!
