 and that's how tyranny happens. 




 But....Bush!!! 




 The "most transparent administration in US history".

Riiiiiiiiiight. 




 Obama saying something else is Bush's fault?  When will he start leading?
He is one who **provided ISIS with TOW missiles**.

Also, is there any **single one thing** that Obama likes about America?

This man is not fit to lead a kindergarten teeball team.  He should be put in handcuffs and removed from office. 




 And Democrats want the federal govt in charge of the health system. 














 This is what happens when governments run schools. 




 "The most transparent administration in history."

Yet another lie. 









   United States has been heavily arming an apartheid state that has WMD.

Ahhh, to be young and naive again.
 




 That's easy to say when terrorists aren't firing artillery into your neighborhood. 




 Anthropomorphic global warming is a farce and a political movement to undermine Western capitalist nations.

Devastating periods of climate activity are going to happen, with or without humans present. Consider the ice ages. Glaciers several kilometers thick formed and moved thousands of miles, crushing everything in their paths. There is no scientist on earth that can tell you why this occurred.  There were several interglacial periods of warming, where ice was rapidly melting.   We are probably in one of those periods now.  


Even the founder of Greenpeace stated before Congress there is no scientific evidence of anthropomorphic global warming.   

Relax, the sky's not falling. We don't need more govt control to avert another fake crisis. Sound familiar? 




 Democrats have expanded the federal government every chance they've had.

Obama voters: You've made your bed. Now lie in it. 




 They are not going to release the account number of the US Treasury. 




 You know what I call people who rob stores? 

Thugs. 









 Paging Al "The ice caps could be gone by 2014" Gore. 









 Just because you post things on the Internet doesn't make them true.
Obama is on the verge of enabling a nuclear Iran.  Yes even Democrats are jumping ship on this one.

 Please tell me how a nuclear-capable Iran is patriotic and good for America. 









 Health care costs started rising when the federal government got involved with Medicare.  Put the govt out of the equation and market forces will work things out.

Edit: Market equilibrium would never allow a $50 aspirin. Govt intervention  through Medicare is how this initially happened.  Why is the British national pastime queuing? The inefficiencies and bureaucracies of Socialism. 




 Obama is a naive idealogue..  It is fucking insane that we are negotiating to allow a nuclear capable Iran. 




 I read the letter and think it was a great idea. 




 So any criticism of her action is bigotry? It's racism? 
That card is old, worn and a weak argument. 









 But the earth was supposed to be out of crude oil by now.

The polar bears were supposed to be gone unless we curbed energy expansion.

The ice caps were supposed to be gone by now unless we stopped using fossil fuels. 

Acid rain was supposed to destroy the world unless we stopped building factories.

The hole is the ozone layer was supposed to heat the earth unless we stopped using aerosol.

Deforestation was going to destroy the rain forest unless we curtailed Western Civilization's footprint on the earth.

The sky was supposed to fall unlesss we repealed capitalism and submitted all economic control to the state. 




 The intolerance of the left strikes again. 









 Yes. How else do you think ISIS got their hands on TOW missiles they are seen using in their propaganda videos?  

Standing with the muslims? Yes we can!

 This person is celebrating attempted murder of police officers.  If you think this is cool or even acceptable you should probably move out of your mom's basement. 









 They won't stop until they control all facets of our lives.  Tyranny isn't coming in the front door wearing a white hood.  It is coming in the back under the guise of green living. 














 "The lunches are heavily subsidized by the Government"

So these lunches really aren't 60 cents. Someone is paying for them and probably at a high markup/overhead considering they are government funded. 




 Wake up Reddit!  Don't buy this!  Why would Obama support a nuclear Iran?  They have stated the *intention* to "wipe Israel off the map".  Israel is a free and Democratic nation unlike Iran where homosexuals are hanged.

It's unbelievable that any American supports Iran or negotiations with them.  The fact that Obama and Kerry are so passive and even supportive of Russia and Iran is indicative of ethical collapse. 









 But the shooters were such good boys. They DinDuNuffin. 




 Where do you get this reality from?  Most likely you are not a climate scientist, so you get your 'reality' about our climate from a little rectangular screen that tells you what to think,

 




 Who makes up these codes? Who decides what speech in a private setting is not allowed? 














 "I'll have more flexibility after the election."
Barack Hussein Obama to Russian president

Charge him with treason. 




 If you think government is more accountable than the private sector you're going to have a bad time. 




 "Hiding profits in tax havens is one of the most common ways large corporations avoid paying their fair share to the IRS."

You know what's not fair?  Working hard to get somewhere and having to provide free housing, Obama phones, food stamps, disability, education and health care to people who sit around and smoke weed all day.  Most low to medium income people don't understand this because they pay little, none or even negative tax.

Rewarding the unsuccessful and punishing the successful is an unsustainable economic proposition. 




 Don't you mean Russia's actions in Crimea make it very possible? 




 Why is the Secretary of State running a charity while in office? The potential for corruption is high with this one. 









 More excuses for the lies and corruption of the Democrat party.  You will make a good serf. 









 More nonchalance from the Democrat semen chuggers of Reddit. Your nonstop excuses for Democrat lies and corruption will be a double edged sword. 




 More gargling of Democrat semen by Reddit.  
If a Democrat commits a crime, not a big deal.  The rule of law is not important here, just whims of the mob. 




 You now carry a burden so others don't have to. 


































 The root of the global warming movement lies in a big government, anti-capitalist ideology.  When global warming was discredited by data, they swiftly changed to climate change.

Climate change is not about the environment but, like most left of center ideas, it's about societal control and the repeal of capitalism. 




 I'd rather have wrong ideas than outlawed ideas. 




 The author is an atmospheric physicist from MIT.  It looks like you are the denier of science.

Or do you just baaaa that when it fits your agenda? 




 Liberalism: Ideas so good they're mandatory. 
























 The truth will come out about Benghazi.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i4tuuy1jsw

Q: Why was no support **ever** sent while American troops were being overrun? The fought for over eight hours with an unarmed drone overhead watching them die.

Q: Why did we send an unarmed drone and not fighter jets that were **one hour away** in Italy?

Q: Why did Obama go to bed and then fly to Las Vegas for a fundraiser the next morning, all while the Ambassador's whereabouts were unknown?

 I knew before I even looked. 




 "Gov. Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that al-Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not al-Qaida. You said Russia ... the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years,"
-Barack Hussein Obama

This is what happens when you put an amateur in the White House. 




 We can't have black people wandering off the Democrat plantation and thinking for themselves. /s 














 It's good to see the State Dept has time to tweet in between their arms shipments to ISIS. 









 The only thing wrong about this article is the number.  There are 20+ million illegals in the US. Since Obama's executive amnesty and his orders to cease deportations and even apprehensions, they are pouring in.  

Third world status?

Yes we can! 




 They most certainly will not be deported for voting. 









 How about deporting people that have broken our laws and not paid a dime of income tax? 




 Don't you know who occupies 1600 Pennsylvania Ave? 

It's the Chicago way. 



















 The rule of law is no more. 




 Don't worry liberal hipsters.

Your man pajamas, lattes and tolerance will protect you. /s
