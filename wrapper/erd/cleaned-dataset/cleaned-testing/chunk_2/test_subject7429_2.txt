 Half-Life. I want them to just say that 3 won't be made so I can be done with it forever. The fandom is annoying, Gordon Freeman isn't really a character, so why should he be revered the way he is, and I'm tired of hearing about it literally everywhere. 




 That band, man... 




 MOTHERFUCKIN' SHIBE 




 So worth it. 




 I Hate Hartley 




 Saw these guys on their first American tour. They were amazing then and have only gotten better! 




 A fire breathing beaver! 




 I never got to see it, what was so bad about it? 




 Shaking hands.... 




 And /r/thecheapestofamazon 




 Contrasumption? 




 We've known Teppei personally for a few years, now. He's a really cool and layer back guy!

Edit: We took him to dinner before the shows every time he came to CO since we met him. 









 I still do. It's the handle, man. The handle makes drinking anything better. 




 Most probable worst case scenario, you YLOD and need new thermal paste. You'll probably be ok! 




 My school had an assembly about it. I had no choice. 




 Wait... Then what the fuck is a berry? 




 It's a collection of all the TF2 comics, L4D comics, and the like for other games. 




 That sounds fucking awesome. Literal all-star cast. 




 Ah, I see you've unlocked the [Butthurt] trait. New player? 




 Thanks for making me realize I don't know how borrowing works... Asshole. 




 Aaaaaaaaand you're a bad person. 




 One of my favorite bands! 









 FUCK YOU, FERD, YOU UNFABULOUS SHIT

Edit: Why the *fuck* do I keep seeing you?! 




 You two will always be at odds.  




 Well, realistically, Tolkien never would've been able to finish it because it's just so extensive. 




 Dammit, I can't handle unfinished Middle-Earth, if GoT is never finished I'll go insane. 




 Yeah, I pretty much said "fuck that" after seeing words like vivacious, bemused, and haughtiness. I learned two of those words last year. 




 Everything on NoSleep is true even if it isn't. 




 Dude... Fuck you. 




 I'm afraid of the beach, oceans, and lakes for this very reason. 




 Tricycles. I am terrified of riding tricycles.

Edit: also, laying on my stomach with my legs hanging over an edge. I'm terrified someone is just going to walk up and break my knees by hitting/pushing my lower legs really hard.

Edit 2: OH! And moths flying into my ears.  




 It's gonna be Cooking Mama X Mass Effect! 




 I thought that was a subreddit and tried exceptionally hard to figure out how it would be relevant before clicking on it. Needless to say, I was disappointed. 




 /r/DIY ? It sounds like it belongs there... But I've never seen a casket on it, so I don't know. 




 Well there's different words for different age groups. I can't remember off the type of my head, but pedophile really only applies to a range of like 7-9 year olds or something like that. 




 What's one of the most fun things you've ever done and why? 




 I agree. Not to mention, I feel like exclamation points make me seem excited, so caps convey anger better. 




 I'd like some recommendations, any genre at all.  If you like it, I'll check it out.

Edit: Thanks a bunch! I'll do my best to check all of them out! 




 I'd like something new to read and I'm not going to say what I've already read in order to get a little more variety. So, bring it on!

Edit: Why the down votes? I'd just like a few new comics to read....

Edit 2: Thanks a lot, guys! I'll try and check all of them out! 




  (`)
LOOK AT IT
Just... FUCKING LOOK AT IT
 (`) 




  (`) 




 I still hate you.... Like, a lot.  




 TIL that the Fire Nation is North Korea. 




 Be honest.... Did you search "period blood?" 




 Why the *fuck* did you spell the numbers?! 




 My current favorite has to be Our Darkest Days by Ignite.

http://youtu.be/pToEaI9TkJI - Bleeding 




 Please provide a link to the album or a song from it! 




 I saw a Prius that said "smuggg" on the plates in reference to the Southpark episode. I thought it was pretty funny. 




 There's nothing fabulous about you, Ferd.... 




 THANK YOU O_O 




 That's my phone's shadow. 









 Ooh! ME! 




 Over yonder! 




 I'm a T Swift fan, myself. 




 With Taylor Swift? She won an award and he jumped up on stage and took the mic from her and started screaming about how Beyonce should've won. It's where the "I'mma let you finish, but..." Joke came from. 




 There was a duffel bag left in the school parking lot and the police were called. All this bomb threat jazz and it was later found out to be a Kermit the Frog doll that was stolen from one of the teachers earlier that year. It is now a school "holiday" where everybody wears green. 




 1497 




 I thought he literally pulled out a quarter and then it somehow broke. I was always confused what the quarter had to do with the situation at hand. 




 Redditors for 334 days... You check out. 




 Will.i.am is just awkward all around. 




 No one beats Liam fucking Neeson in FO3! 




 Well, since I'm all the way down here.... 




 I know a lot of military and they're good people that are going through exactly what we're going through. Don't blame them. 




 It was the same with me. A game with no dialogue or really in depth backstory made me tear up at the end. Only game that ever made me do that. 




 I'd recommend you get Journey and the Unfinished Swan. They're both PS Store purchases and they're amazing. 




 Oh, yeah. My bad. 




 There's an arcade game called T.E.C. 3001. It's awesome.

Edit: Indie* 




 Because it's a heavily anticipated game from a prestigious studio. 




 Well, by your logic, you got your ignorance from your father and you're completely ignorant of the fact. 




 YOU'RE AN AWFUL THREAD 




 As much as I dislike GameStop's way of business, I'd hate to see them go. They have some good stuff and the employees their are some of the best conversations I've had about the video game industry and really nice guys. 




 Completely absurd, my good man. 




 May I partake?


YOU SHIT-EATING, CRUSTY, JAGGED PIECE OF WALRUS ANUS 




 Not exactly what I was looking for, but I still like it! Thanks! 




 Like one that shows off really cool or creative cars, motorcycles, ect. 




 I also think the PS3's Netflix layout is a lot better. The Xbox' is just annoying to use. 




 I saw the thumbnail and didn't read the title... I thought it was an Anchorman 2 picture. I'll just say I was disappointed. 




 In quite a butthurt fashion, might I say. 




 The butthurt is strong in this one. 




 Ah, I believe you meant to say empanada, my good man. 




 I keep getting Serious Sam and Duke Nukem 3D coupons. 




 What's with Guy Fawkes masks and these pictures? 




 I... I take 45 minute bathroom breaks. No one believes that I just don't care enough to get up sometimes. 




 BUT SHE'S ALREADY SAT HERSELF DOWN SO GINGERLY! 




 You need 4 leg holes for 2 penises? 




 Um... Thanks? 




 Um... Thanks? 




 "*Yes.*"
