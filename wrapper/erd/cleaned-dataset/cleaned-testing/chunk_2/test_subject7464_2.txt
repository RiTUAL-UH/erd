 Came across [this woman's account of her attack](http://dayre.me/davienne/pLKsQpVoUr). She's also a young Singaporean in he mid-twenties and similarly, her attacker was a cyclist that came across her on a walkway at night.

Thanks for sharing your experience. Reading both of your accounts has reminded me that I should not take it for granted that Singapore is a relatively safe place. Heck, i walk home past midnight along dimly-lit walkways quite often without batting an eyelid. Not sure if I'd dare to do so anymore.
