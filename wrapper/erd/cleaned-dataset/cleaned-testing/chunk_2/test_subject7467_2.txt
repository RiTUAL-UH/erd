 Disrespectful American dogs are trying to disgrace our glorious leader with pitiful capitalist propaganda.

 Your hands look like they could use some lotion. 




 I really enjoyed the nemesis system but never prgressed very far in the story. I managed to get evrything you can that doesnt unlock in story mode. there was just no push to play the story in that game 




 Yea having  books make you look more smarter 




 i didnt know onions were toxic to dogs. They grow wild all over my backyard and the dogs like to dig them up.

 That woke something inside of him 




 A new pub is opening up on the square, in case the Abbey inn and loophole weren't enough. How many restaurants does this town need? It's ridiculous 









 There are a few posts regarding the push for $15 per hour. Of closer the objectivist.deem to be out in force. I consist this an important sub for us. Its got young people who are tired of capitalist exploitation, but many have never heard good arguments for socialism. 




 I'm a full time student and I'm working full-time as well. I don't have any spare time to do stand up. I really like it, but have only managed to go up a few times, and that was when I wasn't working as much. 




 SJW hate freedom of speech. They believe we deserve to always feel comfortable. Nothing offensive should be seen or heard. Everyone is special and unique, but only socialize with the group you were born in to.  To want anything else, or to feel offended is wrong. 









 But I don't have a gym membership. How do I turn my home into a temple? 









 I have several tvs and I have no idea how to optimize the settings. The picture looks different in all of them, but I have no idea what the settings do our what optimal should look like 














 It's been two days already. 









 After seeking treatment for depression and being on meds for two years I'm off and feeling great! My only problem is I feel like I can't focus. I'm more distracted and know for a fact my attention span and memory are not the same. Has anyone else experienced something similar? I have been off lecapro for a few months now also. 




 Where does this leave me? I fundamentally agree with communism and Marxism, but the violent employed by lenin and stalin are appalling to me. How can you justify slave labor and famine as means of control? It seems like I can't be a pacifist communist. Would I just be a socialist then? 




 I am looking for readings about feminism. I figure there had to be some people who have a real knowledge about it, not just stuff they picked up on a blog, in this sub. 









 I really have no idea. I thought it was about a girl who slept with reviewers for a better ratings for her game. Was that ever a thing, or just a rumor? Now it seems to be about women in gaming? 




 If you set all the pet birds free in America they couldn't all get picked off by predators. Then they might breed and we would have pretty parrots 




 Archery has always looked cool. Is there is anywhere nearby I could take a lesson? 




 I was looking to do some wildlife rehab or other kinds of wildlife volunteering. Can someone point me in the right direction? 




 Or wait for lollipop. I don't really know much about rooting but I would like to take off all the bloatware on my phone 














 And communism as well. I understand there aren't a lot of communists, but in my view almost all the worlds problems are socioeconomic. If we lived in an equal society we wouldn't need mens rights or feminism. I used to think that was the goal of both groups, but now I think they want to be better than each other. Both want their gender to dominate. It just seems odd and at ends with the origins of both movements. 




 Obviously we are gonna lose some people along the way. But basically we should breed bears to be smaller so we could keep them as pets. That would be easier than domestication. If they were like bobcat sized that would be awesome. 




 Why did he make the war on drugs can suck my cock? 









 So my prescription ran out like two weeks ago and I haven't been able to go see my doctor since then. First week was terrible. I had gotten off on my medication I've before during the two years I have been on them so I knew roughly what to expect. I thought I could get them this past week, but my new job and school didn't give me any time to go to my hometown doctor. So now it's been a fee weeks and I feel again. The brain zaps have stopped too. I am supposed to start therapy again soon, but now I don't want to go back on meds. I feel good. I.didn't realize I was.zombied while on meds. I've felt so many emotions lately and it's great. Had anyone experienced something similar? I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow and I don't know if I want to start meds again. 




 I was having the classic lack of diverse superheroes conversation, when someone brought up Silverman being white. I think for the first time I realized he's an alien, so that doesn't make him white. What do you think? 




 Can I just use sohangum moss? Do I need to mix a soil with it? 




 I picked some cotton the other day and decided to try and grow some. I planted a few in a pot and a few in my yard as it's getting closer to winter I want to make sure at least one survives. When it's grown what can I do with it? 









 Mens genitals would be unobstructed in skirts, and women's would be the same in pants. 




 I like to leave my pitcher outside, but I see squirrels around it all the time and if like to protect it. Does anyone grow theirs in a protected area like that? And if you do, can I do any other plants outside in a terrarium? 









 What should I include in seed bombs for usda zone 8? I have milkweed and wildflower seeds.  









 I live in Texas and from why I've read I can plant the seeds in pots and place those outside in sunlight. I also have grow lights. Would it be better to jut keep them under those 24 hrs a day? Also how many seeds should I place in a pot? (6 in)  














 I was watching cosmos last night and NDT described the knowledge that all things are made of star stuff as spiritual. I've always immediately dismissed the word spiritual or anything people claim as spiritual. Now that I'm older I feel that spirituality doesn't have to be incompatible with atheism, but I don't know how they can coexist. Thoughts? How do you define your spirituality? Is it something intrinsically human that we as atheists are trying to suppress?  




 He's upset with me right now for two warrants I have out for unpaid parking tickets. No reason I didn't pay them, just that I just didn't care about them. He's been telling me I need to get it together and I know he's right. I'm just too embarrassed to call because I haven't taken cars of the warrants yet and blew all my money this week.  




 So I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for two years now. I've also been on medication and attended therapy. I feel like I've made no progress. And I'm tired of it. Lately I've had the thought of taking shrooms or acid to see if that helps my depression. I've read lots of anecdotal trip reports where people claim if helped with theirs. I have experimented with psychedelics before, but never more than stupid swaying or mild visuals? Has anyone had the type of experience I'm looking for? 



















 I really like warframe, but my biggest complaint is a lack of storytelling. The Tenno universe is so cool, but the only story you really get is occasional chatter from bosses. I wish DE would expand on the story more.  









 Preferably more recent writing that talk about 21st century communism? That might not make sense but I'm new to communism. It just seems that a lot of the suggested readings are a bit dated. Not that it makes them invalid, I was just looking for a modern interpretation.  



















 The contestants would have to find a new romantic partner and keep the relationship going. The partners can't know anything about the show. The contestant that manages to stay in their relationship the longest will split a large sum of money with their partner 70-30 for the contestant; if the contestant breaks up with their partner upon learning they are the last contestant. The contest could go on for years, with deep intimate bonds forming. If they don't break up they win nothing. This contest will only attract terrible, terrible people. Which will make great tv.  




 I've been on lexapro for a year and a half now. I've been to therapy as well and I feel good now. Im starting a great job this week where I'll make at least three times what I make now. I'm also going back to school in the fall to get a degree in something I like. I know I need to talk to my doctor and gradually taper off, but what was it like when you stopped medication?
