 :D 




 Does it happen more frequently with vegans than non-vegans? In the unfortunate cases where it does happen is it actually attributable to the diet being vegan or is it due to some other factor?

Those are questions that the organizations I cited look into before publishing their statements. I'm willing to bet that whatever sensationalist news story you read did not look into those questions.

The scientific consensus behind the position that appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life is overwhelming. 




 Every major dietetic association in the world agrees that appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life, and they nearly all encourage breast feeding of infants. There is no evidence supporting your assertion that vegan breast milk is any different from non-vegan breast milk (and in fact quite a lot of evidence to the contrary).

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

 I expect Action For Animals to have the tour schedule worked out within the next 2-3 weeks, so they will let you know by then. 




 We had someone bail while I was on tour in 2013 and it messed things up for us quite a bit. 

Can you let me know what shows you might be able to do? I'll check once a schedule has been put together and see if we are still shorthanded for any of those shows. 




 Send a follow up e-mail to your original e-mail letting Action For Animals know that you are interested now. They are trying to work out a schedule for all the shows and that would be good for them to know as they are planning. 




 No. Action For Animals has wristbands that will get volunteers into the shows. When you get to the show you will give one of the volunteers who is travelling with the Tour a call and we will come out and find you to let you in.

 Congrats, that's an awesome position! 




 [Unfortunately, the district attorney has already decided not to press any charges](http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/no-charges-for-colorado-farmworkers-videotaped-hitting-pigs/).

If what was revealed in this video wasn't criminal then the laws need to be fixed. 




 [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/) is a great resource for people looking to include less meat in their diets.

Reddit also has awesome communities at /r/vegetarian, /r/vegan, /r/vegrecipes, and /r/veganrecipes! 




 If companies can get away with treating animals terribly and allowing their workers to outright abuse animals while still selling their product and making a profit then they will continue to do so. Corporations care about what consumers are buying. 




 But instead of doing that, factory farmers are pushing for [ag-gag laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ag-gag) all across the country so they can continue to treat animals terribly while not having to worry about their terrible treatment of animals being exposed to the public. 




 Reddit was also outraged when some tourists lit a quokka on fire in New Zealand, but then we got even more outraged when commenters asked why we were outraged about the quokka while remaining apathetic about all the other animals that are commonly treated poorly. 




 lol, I would have taken it as a joke, but unfortunately far too many people say those things seriously. 




 I certainly appreciated meat. I ate a lot of meat growing up and enjoyed the taste as much as anyone.

Unfortunately, just because something is natural doesn't mean that it is ethical. For example, humans have waged war for millennia. We even see tribal clashes between different groups of great apes. Could anything be more natural? Yet I think we can both recognize that despite being natural we both would condemn unnecessary warfare.

To determine if something is ethical we must look at both the benefits (such as my enjoyment of meat), and the negatives (the harm caused to other animals). As much as I enjoyed the taste of meat, there was little doubt that the harm caused to other animals outweighed these benefits in almost all cases. (One exception might be a food like oysters. While they are technically animals they possess a very minimal nervous system.) 




 Also, /u/YawnY86's long comment said nothing about what is best for the cows. It was simply how their farm maximizes profit at auction. It is incredibly telling how many people in the industry lose the ability to differentiate between what cows might appreciate and what maximizes a farmer's profits. 




 If meat could be produced without any harm to animals I would have no ethical objections to consuming it and would likely eat it on occasion. 




 [Like this](http://store.afa-online.org/product.php?productid=17410 cat=0 page=1)?

Action For Animals has a couple other colors as well if you look through their store. All the money you spend there goes to supporting Action For Animals' activism! 




 Vegans are actually largely supporting and even funding the push for synthetic meat. [Here is an essay from Ingrid Newkirk](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/20/magazine/ethics-eating-meat.html?_r=0) (president of PETA. ^I ^know ^they ^suck ) about how she is excited to eat meat for the first time in 40 years once it can be synthesized.

As much as reddit likes to circlejerk about vegans needing to feel special that really isn't why people choose to be vegan.

[Here is a quote from the animal rights group Vegan Outreach](http://www.veganoutreach.org/advocacy/path.html):

We want a vegan world, not a vegan club. 




 You should share your tofu recipe in the /r/vegan thread for simple vegan recipes. 




 Hey, it's that woman who abuses her chickens by letting them eat their own eggs!
 




 Recipe for /u/test_subject7471's steamed vegetables:

1. Purchase cook-in-bag frozen vegetables.
2. Insert in microwave for amount of time indicated on bag.
 




 I read the comment /u/PumpkinMomma is referring to. I would have found that pretty insulting.  




 Did you look at the other comments about what a great prank this is? People clearly understand that this is a prank and not the most effective way to advocate for animal rights.

We can enjoy humor on this subreddit too. 




 We had a thread from an omni a couple weeks ago saying what a friendly and welcoming community they thought /r/vegan is. I have to say that I have found this community to live up to that reputation as well, and the only hatemongering I see is in posts that try to condemn us all with a single brush.

I do find your second paragraph to be quite telling however. Eating animal products is not merely a personal choice as it does not simply impact oneself. It causes harm to the animals being slaughtered and consumed as well. Vegans view this treatment of animals as being unethical. If you view every comment on the vegan subreddit that says "using animals in this way is wrong" as being hatemongering then it is hardly a surprise that you reach the conclusion that this subreddit is hateful.  




 It is produced by bacteria. It is vegan. 




 I want my own brussel-sprout-hatred ever after story. 




 I ate a vegetable once and I almost puked. How can vegans compare this to REAL foods like chicken nuggets?

Finally, I guarantee that you know some of [these famous vegans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vegans) who look quite healthy. 




 There isn't going to be any product on the market that tastes exactly identical to meat, but there certainly are products that are indistinguishable in certain settings. I have seen taste tests with vegan sausages and vegan ground meat where people were fed these alternatives and conventional meats and they were unable to identify which was which.

People's perception of these products also plays a strong role in how they will claim the products taste. I have seen research on protein bars where they fed people the bar with a wrapper that either said, "contains 9 grams of protein" or "contains 9 grams of soy protein". Despite the bars being identical, the people who received the "soy protein" wrapper rated the product as tasting much worse, but they perceived it as being healthier. 

There isn't anything on the market today that will replicate a 12 oz  chunk of steak, but there are indistinguishable alternatives for many of the settings in which people eat meat today, as long as you go into it without prejudiced expectations based upon knowing the product is vegan. In addition to this for the meats that are not yet being replicated, many of the vegan alternatives on the market are still delicious in their own right and can be a new food that many people would enjoy having added into their diet.

Finally, tastes vary from person to person, so the only way to really discover which foods you like best are to try them out for yourself. 




 [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/) is a great resource for people looking to add more plant-based foods to their diet. 




 [My favorite picture from that site](https://nakedvegancooking.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/cranachan.jpg) 




 You're not at the top of the food chain. An animal that exclusively eats other carnivorous animals, would be at the top of the food chain. That said, the food chain isn't something that tells us how we ought to behave either, it is merely a description of the current state of nature (you cannot derive an ought from an is). 

Clearly you don't need to worry about becoming prey for another animal just because you have chosen to eat more plant-based foods. Your position in that sense is safe. 




 [The actor in that scene went vegan after filming the movie](http://www.humanesociety.org/news/magazines/2015/01-02/unprejudiced-heart-interview-with-babe-actor-james-cromwell.html):

It also inspired me to become vegan. After having worked all morning with these extraordinary animals, I'd see their relatives on the lunch table. They had ham and duck, every animal except horse. That's when I said, "I've got to try to be a vegan." And for the most part, I have been vegan since 1994. 




 Choosing to become vegetarian or vegan isn't going to solve all of the world's problems or even all of the problems with how animals are treated today, but it is something simple that each and every one of us can do that will make a world of difference for those animals who will be spared a life of unimaginable misery thanks to our choices. Reddit has excellent communities at /r/vegetarian, /r/vegan, /r/VegRecipes, and /r/veganrecipes for anyone who is interested in adding more plant-based foods into their diet. I'm thrilled to see redditors caring more and more about how our choices in what we eat impact other animals. 




 If demand declines cows won't be starved. As demand declines fewer cows will be bred to meet the lower demand. 




 While I am not pictured in the photograph, I am comfortable with you thinking that I am any of the four individuals in this image. 




 Well there is a difference in that sea world keeps tens of animals in captivity, while tens of billions of animals are kept on factory farms (and then slaughtered). I would say that is a difference of roughly a factor of a billion. 




 Every major dietetic association in the world agrees that appropriately planned meat-free diets are healthy for all stages of life. Given this wide consensus that there is no need to eat meat for nourishment, can you acknowledge that eating meat is no better than killing animals for pleasure?

 1. It isn't true.

2. [That's not what it means to be vegan](http://www.vegansociety.com/try-vegan/definition-veganism) 




 Commercial free-range egg production isn't much better. Producers still compete with one another to cut costs at the expense of the animals' well being.

[Here is a picture of a free-range egg laying operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-range_eggs#/media/File:Free-range-hens.jpg) 




 You can promote a vegan product to omnivores without encouraging them to consume more non-vegan products at the same time. I have [successfully shared several vegan recipes on non-vegan subreddits](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/search?q=test_subject7471 restrict_sr=on sort=relevance t=all) without having to compromise on my values. The harm they are causing by encouraging people to use chicken breasts almost certainly outweighs the good of getting a few more people to try Daiya.  




 How did you come across the movie Fowl Play?

 The school cafeteria is going to point you to a food service company. If you're lucky they will tell you a packaging/manufacturing or some other wholesaler that they get a specific product from. That company may source product from one or dozens of places that refine ingredients, which they are unlikely to divulge. Finally the ingredient refiners probably source from hundreds of farms. 

It is going to be very difficult to trace the chain back all the way to a farm.

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

 I agree. Bullfighting is still incredibly cruel, but too many people glaze over the fact that the way animals are treated on today's farms is even worse. 




 I'm sure there will be a post soon about how vegans need to stop hatefully shoving our views about cutting on the bias down the throats of lacto-ovo vegetarians (since obviously /r/vegetarian is only for lacto-ovos). Then we will have to keep all posts that mention cutting on the bias on /r/vegan too. 




 [You wanna fight? I'll take you down so hard!](http://i.imgur.com/kHRKOcu.gifv) 




 What about their sensitive vegetarian feelings when they see how much better we look than they do? 




 I was really reluctant to become vegan even after I found out more about how terribly animals are treated for dairy and egg production (and slaughtered all the same). I tried signing up on the Vegan Freak forums though since I really liked their podcast, but I told them that going vegan was too hard for me. They were a bunch of meanies and told me that my excuses sucked and that their forums were a safe place for vegans only.

I decided to give veganism a shot since I wanted to be a part of the forums, and 7 years later I couldn't be more happy that I did! 




 Are you saying we need to start posting more nudes to /r/vegetarian? I suppose I could help out. 




 I usually recommend [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/) to omnis who might be interested in adopting a diet with fewer animal products. It is run by Mercy For Animals and everything they promote is entirely vegan. 




 Don't worry, on /r/vegan we have lots of talk about our awesome vegan poops. 




 I'm not sure if your comment is sarcastic or not. Clearly there are still issues with things like factory farming that nobody should support whether they are omni, lacto-ovo, or vegan. 




 Woah, if you are trying to disagree with something that a lacto-ovo vegetarian says you can only do that over at /r/vegan! 




 I'm not sure how I feel about getting multiplied by carnistscum. 




 Seriously, if she wants to not eat dairy and eggs that is her personal choice, but it is my right to consume these products that don't harm anyone. It's not like anyone is going to cry if I choose to drink milk, and it's not like anyone gets ground up alive so that I can eat eggs. 

If you vegans want to disagree with me on that point then you can only say that over at /r/vegan where nobody here will have to listen to you. 




 Oh come on, I have contributed enough to this subreddit to earn my place on the list of people you don't like. 




 Why don't you do your thing over at /r/meatfreediet? If people want to only hear about what you like then they'll join you over there.

/r/vegetarian is a place for discussing all types of vegetarian diets and that includes vegan ones. 




 You keep acting like vegans aren't also vegetarians. The purpose of /r/vegetarian is to promote vegetarian lifestyles and that includes vegan ones. 




 People need to be careful about what they say or they could make someone cry like a baby calf that has been separated from his mother.  




 The purpose of /r/vegetarian is whatever vegetarians are interested in. That is a wide variety of topics, some of which also includes harm caused to animals by production of some vegetarian foods. If something is upvoted that tends to be a pretty good sign that vegetarians find it relevant to the subreddit. We don't need additional censorship from the mods. 




 But I have to be careful to only consider the feelings of the people on /r/literallyhitler, and not the ~~jews~~ chickens that are being gassed, right? 




 You aren't the one suffering. The animals are the ones being oppressed. Vegans aren't oppressing vegetarians by discussing issues pertaining to the treatment of other animals on this subreddit. 

People who care about how animals are treated, which I would argue is the majority of this subreddit, want to see discussions on the topic, even if it goes beyond simply how eating the flesh of animals is bad for animals. 




 It was my thread that they are accusing of vegetarian-shaming! 




 60% of my redditing is done from my throne of moral superiority. 




 I happen to be reading Nick Cooney's new book on the subject right now. 

[How To Be Great At Doing Good by Nick Cooney on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Great-Doing-Good-ebook/dp/B00SZ6378S/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8 sr= qid=) 




 One cruel step in an incredibly cruel system. 




 The cage free picture is from [this Sierra Club article](http://www.sierraclub.org/chicago/sierra/2015-2-march-april/feature/local-roots-vs-industrial-agriculture#8)

The Free Range picture is from [the Wikipedia article on free range eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-range_eggs)

The organic picture is from [this CBS news article](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trouble-in-the-henhouse-the-scam-of-organic-eggs/) 




 Here's the thing that people frequently miss when judging the environmental impact of local products versus far away products. If you buy steak or any other product from 5,000 miles away they aren't putting that one steak in a car and having someone drive it 5,000 miles. They are loading 10,000 lbs of product onto a truck/airplane and shipping all of that. If you bought 1lb of steak your portion of that is equivalent to roughly half a mile of transport. If you drove an extra 5 miles to find a place that sells locally sourced meat that is going to be roughly 10 times as harmful as buying the meat from across the country if you as an individual drive a shorter distance to pick it up.

Then again, none of this actually looks at how the animals are treated.  The places where lots of people live aren't able to produce lots of products that rely upon vast open land area to be produced. To meet a city's increasing demand for local products it is only possible if it becomes increasingly intensive and increasingly confined. 




 [Here are pictures of cage-free, free-range, and organic egg laying operations](http://imgur.com/a/fp7C0). They are also all local to somewhere. 




 Yeah dawg 




 If I've learned one thing about nutrition from vegans it is eat a lot of just one thing. Too much variety is never healthy in your diet. 




 They're all sleeping right now. Probably dreaming about eating vegan fish and chips. 




 Why would things only matter if they exist indefinitely? If it doesn't matter that you have had a positive impact for 100 years or 100 million years into the future, why would longer or indefinite periods of time make your impact matter? 




 I'm not impossible. I'm right here. 




 Did Dave talk to you a bunch about getting snipped while you were on tour with him? 




 The same thing that happened to all the people who were working in VCR factories, retailers, and repair shops when people stopped buying VCRs. They will find new jobs. Most likely ones that utilize similar skill sets. 




 Check out [VeganBodyBuilding.com](http://veganbodybuilding.com/) 




 Won the lottery and one step closer to getting your shiny vegan badge! 




 Plant foods are great sources of B-vitamins with the exception of vitamin B12.

Vitamin B12 isn't costly to get anywhere. It is produced by bacteria, and can only be reliably obtained from animal based foods, fortified foods, or a supplement. 




 A multivitamin costs less than $0.10 per day. Tons of foods like cereals and soy milks are fortified as well. 




 You haven't made a case for why either one of those things is okay. Killing animals for either of those reasons probably is not acceptable. 




 I have heard that vegan foods are so low in nutrients that vegans need to eat a mountain of food every day just to be able to survive. 




 The real key is the fiber. Studies have found that 99% of omnis suffer from pernicious fiber deficiency, and this can lead to digestive duress, bad stories for their poop blogs, and even death. This looks like a healthy (and delicious) high fiber meal. 




 /u/BlizeH. I also got an additional 1 quid (also from BlizeH) since I made the above comment. 




 I was hoping to see this as a gif 




 So far I have earned $1 and 6 months of reddit gold from my activism. Well on my way to retirement! 




 This is a gif that I submitted to /r/aww and /r/gifs today. There are a lot of good comments on the /r/gifs submission. 




 It is a loving cow. 




 A big part of getting the price down is having the capital to begin mass producing product and begin getting product out to lots of stores/people very efficiently. The large investment is a good sign that this product could be at a very competitive price. 




 Any other pangolins out there?

[pictures of /u/test_subject7471](https://www.google.com/search?q=pangolin espv=2 biw=1920 bih=971 site=webhp source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=r4M4VZqbHcHdoASInICYAQ ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ) 




 I hope to see this on the front page tomorrow. 




 Use the .gifv file format. Actual .gif files take forever to load. Also that is a really good gif. 




 How do you know that someone thinks they could never be vegan?

Don't worry, they'll tell you. 




 That /u/infinity guy is really popular. I wish I got as many username mentions as he does.

(My username starts with a lowercase L) 




 Oh no! I don't want to kill anything!  :P 




 There are a couple people who keep accusing my gifs of being a secret vegan plot to control reddit (or something like that). 

I'm not trying to be secretive about what I'm doing. I'm vegan and I'm thrilled when more people choose to cut back on animal products, especially when it is because of one of my posts. All I'm doing though is sharing content that I appreciate and that I think other redditors will appreciate too. There's nothing secretive or sinister about that. 




 Yeah, I do a good amount of leafleting and tabling. I donate to Animal Charity Evaluators' recommended charities. I started an animal rights club back in college. I have toured as a volunteer with Action For Animals at the Warped Tour for the past couple years and I'm planning to do it for a little over a week again this summer.

That sounds like a lot, but I really still am a normal guy most of the time. I could/should be doing much more. 




 I wonder how /u/infinity feels about getting all these username mentions. 




 Really?  In the "What is philosophy?" guidelines to posting it mentions, "Value Theory, which includes ethics/moral philosophy, political philosophy, aesthetics, and similar areas."

I can't see how this would not fall under that umbrella. 




 Record it on video and upload it to YouTube so that we can show even more omnis! 




 [Here it is](http://i.imgur.com/99X3uRh.gifv) 




 [This is my favorite gif of pigs eating](http://i.imgur.com/IovOTlX.gifv) 




 Pigs are such incredible animals... [Look at this one doing a puzzle!](http://i.imgur.com/O6h0DPM.gifv) 




 This is my favorite comment. :) 




 There are other gay vegan dudes in the South right now thinking to themselves how much they would like to find someone who's vegan. 




  Maccas

Found the Australian! 




 I know that they raised a lot of money that they put toward improving their ability to distribute Soylent efficiently. I'm not sure if they have fixed all of the issues with the long wait times to distribute product yet, but I expect it to either be resolved by now or it will be soon. 




 It is difficult to really show if someone else feels pain. Fish respond to painkillers in ways that seem to suggest that pain is being relieved. [Here is a site which refers to some good studies about that](http://www.fishpain.com/fish-and-pain-analgesic.htm).

Also, this doesn't specifically deal with pain, but [Wikipedia has a good article on Fish Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_intelligence). 




 You should be upset. What they are doing is absolutely not okay. I'm sure their condesention and dismissive attitude is beyond frustrating as well. Don't try to get rid of that passion that you feel.

Keep in mind though that you aren't the one suffering. When reacting to your parents or anyone else think of what will be best for helping the animals, not what will feel most satisfying for you. Sometimes that might mean showing your frustration or telling someone off, but more often that means remaining cool and rational, acting like you understand where people are coming from, and presenting the animals' case in the most levelheaded way you can. 




 This is a case that will go down in history. When the future looks back at the abysmal treatment of most animals today they will point to this case as setting important precedent for securing non-human animals better protection under the law. 




 Thank you. 

First of all I want to thank my mom and dad for always being there for me. Gotta thank the big man upstairs. And of course all those fans out there who upvoted me. I couldn't have done it without you guys. 




 Pig farmer Bob Comis who holds himself to the highest standards of animal welfare writes, "I cannot think of one sound ethical argument in favor of slaughtering animals for their meat." After years getting to know the personalities of the animals he raises, he questions whether it is right for him to go on in the industry. 




 If I had to compare the taste to something I would say it tastes something like pancake batter, but I think it is more enjoyable than drinking straight pancake batter would be. It definitely works for keeping me full and keeping my energy levels up. 




 I have given up on dating omnis. We don't share enough in common and it is much too emotionally draining to see someone you care about regularly acting in ways that you find to be unethical. I am content with being single until I can find a worthwhile vegan girlfriend. 




 There are tons of cosmetics available that aren't tested on animals and do not contain animal products. That said, what someone's mom does should have no impact on that person's ability to speak up about what is right and wrong. 




 I remember hearing something from them about raising a lot of capital to improve their ability to distribute their product more efficiently (it took almost 4 months for me to receive my order). I wouldn't be surprised to see them making international shipping available soon. 




 I can't wait to hear why people shouldn't be able to protest animal abuse if their moms wear makeup... 




 I have been using it for the past month or so. The taste is unobjectionable and it is incredibly convenient. I don't use it at normal meals, but if I don't feel like making anything or if I'm putting off a trip to the supermarket it is great to have around. I'm sure it would be great to take along while backpacking or travelling too. 




 They don't do any of those things. 




 They do not. 




 Have you considered just getting some [soylent](http://www.soylent.me/) to bring with you to places where you may not have many food options? 




 This gives me an idea of something to try. Sharing videos with people that have vegan videos in the related videos or as the "Up Next" video in the sidebar. 




 The average person also doesn't live to 80 years old without scientific interventions. You benefit every day from iodized salt, fortified breakfast cereals, enriched flour, and countless other fortified foods. We should embrace the better choices we can continue to make in the future thanks to today's technological advances.

 That has nothing to do with the parents being vegan and everything to do with parents who fed an infant apple juice and soy milk instead of breast milk or infant formula.

Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

 Let me quote /u/paleolitech:

Vegans abuse less plants you idiot, the inefficiency of animals (80% at best, 5% at worst) means you will indirectly kill 20% to 95% more plants in your lifetime than the average vegan.

And before you insult me or accuse me of "Lol PETA asshole", I mod /r/anti_vegan, so you know you're an idiot when even somebody critical of veganism calls you out on your BULLSHIT.

And HOOOOOLY FUCK, it's funny how you people are outraged somebody lit a little animal on fire then instantly reduce said animal to the non-conciousness of plants in seconds, all to make yourselves feel better.

Fucking idiotic. 




 First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out
Because I was not a Socialist.

Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.

Then they came for meand there was no one left to speak for me.

 New York City cannot grow enough crops or produce enough meat to sustain its population. Instead of starving they have decided to import food from outside the city. 




 In college I used to tape things like this up in bathroom stalls on campus. People at bulletin boards tend to just glance past things that are a lot of text, but when someone is on the toilet they are a captive audience. 




  I'd like to see some more concrete borders on what is ethically wrong with eating animals rather than the classic utilitarian "if it can feel suffering" because that is easily refuted.

Oh really? Let me hear how you easily refute the utilitarian reason for not harming other animals. 




 Plenty of people claimed that slavery was natural 200 years ago. It had been happening for all of recorded human history and was written into the bible.

 /r/SummerScavengerHunt

 We run a photo   video scavenger hunt each summer where participants show items they've found or tasks they've completed from the scavenger hunt list (last year's list can be found in the sidebar). The moderators then award points to your team if the submission meets the criteria (teams can be one or two people).

This year's scavenger hunt will be starting on June 1st. 




 That picture should be a submission of its own on /r/vegan. More people should see the impact that having these discussions can have.

 Nope. Every major dietetic association in the world agrees that appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life!

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

  A system of moral principles are views of right and wrong ~~enforce by a society~~. Since not eating meat is not enforced nor viewed as bad by society, it is by definition ethical.

Using that first definition your conclusion does not follow. 

The dictionary's example works that the ethics of a culture are a system of moral principles of a culture. That doesn't mean that the word can only refer to the moral principles of a culture or society. It refers, as the definition states, to a system of moral principles.

Your argument is being mocked on /r/badphilosophy. I don't think you can claim that vegans are the only ones who find holes in your reasoning.

 




 No, you were not using definition #1. Definition #1 does not limit the system of moral principles to only those held by society as a whole. Your argument relied upon that point. 




 [Dictionary.com definitions of "ethics"](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ethics?s=t)

1. (used with a singular or plural verb) a system of moral principles:
*the ethics of a culture.*


2. the rules of conduct recognized in respect to a particular class of human actions or a particular group, culture, etc.:
*medical ethics; Christian ethics.*

3. moral principles, as of an individual:
*His ethics forbade betrayal of a confidence.*

4. (usually used with a singular verb) that branch of philosophy dealing with values relating to human conduct, with respect to the rightness and wrongness of certain actions and to the goodness and badness of the motives and ends of such actions.

You seem to have used definition 2 as if it was the only definition. When clearly definition 1 fits far better for how the term is frequently used and used in the context to which you are attempting to respond. And definition 3 states that ethics and morals can be used interchangeably contrary to your entire argument. 




 Suppose another group of humans decided that you weren't part of their society and they amassed more military force than you had available to protect you. Would that make it okay for them to treat you as you would condone treating animals?

 PETA is certainly a group with significant shortcomings, and people should donate to other animal rights groups ([Here are charities that Animal Charity Evaluators has recommended as the most effective for helping animals](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/)); however, PETA does not kill 95% of animals in their van, and there is a good reason why they have a high euthanasia rate (they offer humane euthanasia options to a community that cannot afford it otherwise).

 It is only vitamin B-12 that vegetarians and vegans need to look out for. They tend to get plenty of the other B vitamins. 

Products like soy milks and meat alternatives that are designed with vegetarian and vegan consumers in mind are frequently fortified with vitamin B12 accordingly, as are many other common foods like breakfast cereals. As an added precaution a supplement is also encouraged to protect against B12 deficiency. Personally, I [take one of these multivitamins](http://smile.amazon.com/Deva-Vegan-Vitamins-Multivitamin-Supplement/dp/B001GAOHVG/) every couple days so that I don't have to worry about it.

 Yes, if the same tissue could be produced without contributing to any harm to animals then I would happily consume it.

Generally people who are vegetarian or vegan for ethical reasons would be happy to consume animal products produced without harming animals. Those who are veg* for health reasons would not consume the products, and those who abstain for environmental reasons would need to know the environmental impact of producing tissue in this fasion.

 [Did you read the research?](https://humaneleaguelabs.wordpress.com/2013/07/19/report-which-leaflet-is-more-effective/). It found rates around 1% went vegetarian and far more who reported giving up some meat.

These numbers were actually lower estimates. When Humane League Labs did [better research the following year](https://humaneleaguelabs.wordpress.com/2014/05/20/report-what-elements-make-a-leaflet-more-effective/) they found that people had cut even more meat out of their diets and the  number of people who went vegetarian after receiving a booklet was once again around 1%

[Someone flew a drone over the subreddit and took this picture](http://i.imgur.com/imcWlKx.jpg) 




  given the sheer number of leaflets that have been distributed, we should expect significantly more vegetarians and vegans than there actually are.

Have you tried doing the math on this? Vegan Outreach has distributed roughly 20,000,000 booklets. If we assume that 1% of people who receive a booklet go vegetarian that would be 200,000 vegetarians. Far fewer than the total number of vegetarians in the United States.

 You are awesome. 




 Relative to the RDA, oats are higher in protein than carbs or fat. 




 I would still try to make choices that cause as little pain as possible. 




 Right now you are benefiting from eating countless fortified foods. Iodine deficiency has plummeted since the advent of iodized salt. You eat enriched flour and breakfast cereals fortified with dozens of vitamins and minerals. You can't recreate these things without relying on the store.

Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis.
 




 Those are factual statements. I'm not following how you get from there to how we ought to behave.

I can say. "Humans have waged war for millennia. Violence is natural." However, I still condemn unnecessary violence. Wouldn't you? 




 I happen to think I am more capable of making informed ethical decisions, but if you think other animals are smarter than you are then I can see why you would look to them to guide your ethics. 




 So is it because something has happened for a long time that you think makes it okay, or are you trying to suggest that humans have evolved eating meat therefore it cannot be healthy to not eat meat? Could you flesh out this position a bit more? 




 Vegan Outreach shared it on Facebook. 




 I see that there is another party called "Shooters and Fishers" that won two seats. [This appears to be a political party centered around protecting people's "right" to hunt and fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooters_and_Fishers_Party).  

*sigh* 




 I want my beliefs to be able to stand up to all accurate information. If there is information that would challenge my beliefs then it is my beliefs that should change, not the information that should be silenced. 




 If you lived in a violent and bloody society you wouldn't just be the one committing the violence. You would also live in fear of or perhaps be the victim of violence against yourself.

This isn't just hypothetical either. Humans have waged war and participated in tribal violence for millennia. We even see other great apes occasionally engaging in territorial skirmishes with neighboring groups. What could possibly be more natural? 

Yet when you look at a terrible and bloody war taking place right now you would never simply say, "oh, it is just natural so that makes it okay." None of us really believe that nature should be the arbiter of our ethics.
