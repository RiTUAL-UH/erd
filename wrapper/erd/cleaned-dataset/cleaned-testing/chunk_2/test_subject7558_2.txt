 I threw up on myself a couple years ago, the third time i ever tossed and washed. It was the last dose I owned and I was pissed. Ever since then I'm just more careful about it, and hasn't happened since.
 




 That's incredibly inaccurate. I prefer HS over Mmm, Speciosa all day. The quality IMO is better and it's way cheaper. 




 Cost isn't a huge factor? OH SHIT THIS NIGGA BALLIN 




 iOSPoundcake? 




 Wayward apostrophe's

 Well, you can OD on anything, technically. But you would have to eat a pretty god damn ridiculous amount of kratom to die from it. So accidental  overdoses aren't especially harmful with kratom, you can just throw up or lie down until it goes away. 




 You're a dirty nigger 




 What kratomkorner coupons? I don't know of any. 




 He's confusing shills with people who love their products, prices and service. I recommend them all the time. They just have a large following. I'm quite interested to see some concrete shillage though, if there is any. 




 I'll bet you a package of Monistat 7 that it's extremely relevant. 




 The other day I was feeling adventurous, so I decided to try a 3-way strain mixture. I went 2 grams of Red Vein Sumatran, 2 grams of Green Bali, and 2 grams of Red Vein Thai. About 45 minutes later, I was feeling pretty great, when I suddenly felt the need to shit. I went and got on the toilet and squeezed a good one out. However, I was still feeling quite adventurous, so I decided to wipe from back to front. I've always wiped from front to back, and I was just curious what it would be like to not have to lean off the seat to wipe... I could just reach down between my legs. Unfortunately, because of this, I ended up with a yeast infection on my nutsack. Do not recommend. 




 Phenibut and benzos don't have a cross-tolerance? Could that be why? IDK anything about phenibut. I used to be prescribed k-pins as well, i'd get 90 1 mg pills and i would blast through them in 5 days, which i never remembered. It's a horrible drug to be addicted to, and a dangerous one to get off of. 




 Does your tolerance not build when you take DXM? Can I get away with taking a really small dose of DXM? I really don't like the idea of using it every day though. 




 Looks like I better try this tomorrow. I can't seem to talk myself into a washout, unfortunately. 




 Try a different strain. Maeng Da makes me feel like shit. 




 I used to shoot heroin. The first time I ever took kratom, I took 7 grams. I don't know which strain, I didn't know enough about kratom at the time to care. I went from being dope sick to feeling ok in about 20 minutes, it was really quite noticeable. 

I didn't catch a buzz off it at all, I just felt normal again. That was the problem. I didn't want to just be ok, I wanted to be high. I took kratom a few more times at pretty high doses, and then just went back to the opiates.

It wasn't until I went back to prison this last time and got out, that I decided to give kratom a go again. This time it worked great, because I was at baseline as far as my tolerance was concerned. It filled the void I had in me. Even though I'd been sober for about 8 months (I'd used Suboxone in prison in the beginning of my bid) , I still just felt empty. So I gave it a shot and I haven't looked back since. It's been about 8 months. 

The problem is, when he's hooked like that, the mental aspect is half the battle. And having a plant that just keeps him feeling OK is just going to cover the physical side of things, it won't do much for the mental cravings. I would say his best bet would be to (somehow) get off the opiates for about a month and then start a kratom regimen... that way it does something for him both mentally and physically. Other than that, he could start a kratom regimen now and seek outpatient treatment and/or NA/AA for the mental side of things. I don't know. I hope this helps. 




 Call the ambulance right before you take it so they're there when you start to lose your shit. 




 That sounds detrimental to your health. Not the sort of thing you want to deal with long term, who knows what the effects could be. What about veins? Does it happen with red, green and white veins? 




 I can't make heads or tails of this comment. 




 Tomorrow, around noon. 




 Just slip a few grams into her soup and then she'll see the light. 




 Did you pay several hundo for it? Maybe it's heroin. Maybe those are heroin rocks. 




 You do this every day? I need to find a solid method myself. 




 I giggled at your comment. 




 The only green I touch is Bali, mixed with reds, and I haven't been getting any palpitations... so yeah, might be worth experimenting. I also have a history of heart palpitations and anxiety anyway, so I suppose the whites might exacerbate it. 




 What strain are you using? White veins and Maeng Da both give me heart palpitations, along with a plethora of other side effects. I've sworn them off. 




 4) Green stains are hell. Grass stains were always the bane of Mama's existence. 




 Be careful. 




 Tobacco: You may crave tobacco more when using kratom. I chew tobacco and I feel nothing extra after I chew, other than I'm always ready for another chaw as soon as I spit my last one out. Food: Always take kratom on an empty stomach, being full can minimize the effects greatly. Some claim eating a small meal 45 minutes after kratom ingestion can actually potentiate it. I've never witnessed it. Soda: Some also say caffeine increases kratom efficacy. Once again, I've never noticed it. 




 MAKE ME, DICK FACE 




 That brother can keep his ass over here. 




 100 mg oral morphine? Forget about it. Kratom is for people who want to maintain, not for people looking to get high. You'll never achieve that sort of feeling from kratom. Come back and give it a try when you're all strung out and out of options. Until then it's going to be pretty useless to you. Even if you take a heroic dose, the side effects will have you fucked up long before any sort of opioid feeling will. 




 It's really not even comparable to cannabis. If you're opioid naive, you can certainly get a high from it in the beginning. I've never smoked it but I've read reports that it's hardly even worth doing. I'd imagine you'd have to smoke a couple grams of it at once to achieve desired effect, although I'm not familiar with it at all. 




 It's apples and oranges. Kratom is the type of thing that might tempt you to indulge in it more often than you originally planned. I wouldn't recommend it if you're just trying to make your weed go longer. 




 I'll review as well. 




 Junk-Gnomes are sneaking in your room and shooting you with H right after you fall asleep. 




 That's who I think about while I fuck the sandwich. 




 I just saw your name and your comment and I immediately imagined what it'd be like to stick my dick in a vacuum cleaner hose that has a club sandwich jammed in the tip. 




 I have an Amazon gift card, was thinking of coppin some kratom myself but would be pissed if I wasn't happy with it. Best to not chance it I guess. 




 I'll notice he's gone. I'll notice how fuckin peaceful it is without his negativity. lol 




 Your mom choked to death on my wiener 




 I hate the taste of tea.

Herbal Salvation: Great value, my personal vendor****
MMM, Speciosa: Known to have highest quality, but you pay for it.******
Strains: Red Veins (Sumatran, Borneo, Thai, etc.) are best for sedation but I throw a little Green Bali in there to spice it up a notch. It seems to really potentiate the Red Veins, and it's not too speedy. Such combos are great for pain.  




 Good question. He's a dirty shill. 




 Ha. In reality, he's actually a boner consumer. 




 Awwww. Poor thing. 




 Only 77 dollars for 2 ounces. What a steal. 




 You guys could have at least posted a couple other times before dropping your shill post. This is just blatantly obvious and disrespectful to this sub and its subscribers. 




 Cop a sample pack and try them all, see which ones (or combinations) you like best and go from there. Use ginger if you get nausea. Use as little as possible. Get plain leaf, no extracts. Go several days cold turkey from your pain meds before you try kratom and the results will be much better than if you try to transition from one directly to another.  




 This is downright snazzy. Bravo. 




 A couple... When I pooped, my poop already had toilet paper in it. Also, I now own 5 less grams of kratom. 




 It really itched. Do not recommend.

 




 DAMN. THAT BROTHER ASTUTE. 




 Can you deliver to New York? I'll give you a handy-j. 




 Withdrawal from any sort of opioid gives me nightmares, if I can even manage to sleep. 




 WHERE'D IT GO? 




 YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 




 Robbed?

You nod from UEI? 




 Reminds me of people that think ecstasy is cut with heroin or coke. It just doesn't make any sense. Kratom vendors are going to synthesize methadone so they can lace their kratom with it? Sounds crazy.  Surely they wouldn't be using pharmaceutical methadone. That would be even crazier. They wouldn't be able to afford it. I would know for sure if there was methadone in my kratom, lol. I'd be ripped all day, rather than feeling good for a couple hours and then just feeling a glow the rest of the day. Tell ya what though... if somebody finds kratom with methadone in it, I want some. 




 Just jam a ball into your vein. Then you don't have to worry about coming down... ever. 




 Go for it. I chase every dose with ginger ale. If I don't, I get nausea. Ginger ale works really well though. I wouldn't be using kratom without it. I suggest you get some. 




 One time I wiped my ass from back to front and I got a yeast infection on my nutsack. 




 Even when it isn't the holidays, USPS screws up once in a while and loses a package in circulation anywhere from 1 to 10 days. It just happens. It's much more likely during the holidays. I'm sure it'll make it, but give it a week or two. If it never arrives, I imagine MS would replace it.  




 The only thing I understand in this post is MS. 




 I go 2:1 RVS to Green Bali. The RVS does hardly anything by itself, no matter how much I take. But that 1/3rd of Bali REALLY potentiates the RVS. It's the only way I roll.
