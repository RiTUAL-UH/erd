 its ok that you really liked her and now you miss her even if she wasnt in your life that long. i get it; it happens. thats just something you are going to have to give yourself time to get over and move on. 

On the other hand it sounds like the girl has some issues of her own that she is dealing with; trust, commitment, not knowing who she is or what she wants (all hypothetical of course but she was obviously flipflopping at the very least based on this tiny impression you gave on her) so this might just be for the best. 

keep in mind; you didnt end anything on bad terms, take your time and go easy on yourself and try to find some fun distractions in the meantime is my advice. you said you have gone on other dates, so you will clearly have new options, keep an open mind and you never know what will happen.

you should maybe post this over at r/advice or r/relationships because i feel they would be more inclined to give in-depth advice at those types of subs. 




 so but who gets that donut? 




 the home depot logo makes it particularly classy ;) 




 its gross but ive probably gone like 1-2 weeks when im in a bout of depression; they get all stained up (mostly by coffee and cigarettes) and they feel grimy in my mouth. Also plaque builds up, which is the only thing that isnt fixed once i start brushing again (thank god for whitening toothpaste). 

when i start back with the brushing and flossing i also notice all the space and holes between my teeth which i couldnt feel at all during the non-brushing weeks, and notice the food stuck in between them immediate. so the less you floss your teeth, the less it feels like you even have to floss, cuz your teeth are all clogged up with grime.

i feel like i talked for way too long about this gross personal subject. im going to hit save before i change my mind completely.

edit: spellings 




 my highschool had "math for everyday life" which was supposed to be the remedial math class, but was probably the most useful class for highschool students since it taught you how to understand and calculate mortgages, bank ( /other) loans and interest rates, how do understand and do your income ( /other) taxes; stuff that people actually need to know to be an adult. I thought that was pretty good, too bad it was only supposed to be for the "dumb" kids cuz im pretty sure everyone would benefit from that type of class... 




 highschool sweetheart: we were both too immature to particpate in a real relationship. we are friends now and have talked about how different it would have been if we were both mature adults. our relationship was technically "off and on" because we broke up over every (stupid) fight but became "official" again shortly thereafter, rinse and repeat for 2-3 years. lots of jealousy and dumb arguments, that type of shit.

 leave it; its his closet now.
