 If you like military games 




 I didn't think it was his best work either, but still overall a great read. The thing about Slaughterhouse Five (and most of what I've read of Vonnegut) is some of the passages in the book just stand out, and are unforgettable. Someone posted here the other day the excerpt about the poor in America, so I'll throw this one out there instead -

The visitor from outer space made a serious study of Christianity, to learn, if he could, why Christians found it so easy to be cruel. He concluded that at least part of the trouble was slipshod storytelling in the New Testament. He supposed that the intent of the Gospels was to teach people, among other things, to be merciful, even to the lowest of the low.

But the Gospels actually taught this:

Before you kill somebody, make absolutely sure he isnt well connected. So it goes.

The flaw in the Christ stories, said the visitor from outer space, was that Christ, who didnt look like much, was actually the Son of the Most Powerful Being in the Universe. Readers understood that, so, when they came to the crucifixion, they naturally thought, and Rosewater read out loud again:

Oh, boythey sure picked the wrong guy to lynch _that_ time!

And that thought had a brother: There are right people to lynch. Who? People not well connected. So it goes." 




 Sorry for the tired often repeated post, just looking for opinions. I have about every rare and most epics. I've been maining curi's board control warlock, but am trying to build towards druid or maybe shaman.

I have: Sylvanas, Rag, Tinkmaster, Velen, King Krush.

Should I craft Cenarius? Black Knight? Cairne? Something Else? 




 I'm not really into CS, but in League when someone on your team sucks, they end up feeding the other team which inherently makes that member of the other team a lot more powerful. If they're bad enough, they will make someone on the other team so powerful that they have essentially singlehandedly lost the game for your team, all the while you have to suffer and play against someone who is a lot more powerful than you are until the game is over. You likely end up dying a lot due to something out of your control.

Not an excuse to be an asshole, but a possible explanation of why League/DOTA can be really frustrating. 




 Overcosted is the wrong word, should have used too expensive. It's too expensive to be played right now, as it's a dead card in aggro matchups. Maybe that changes after the next patch, when it seems like aggro will drop off a little and druid and shaman control will rise up (or maybe hunter becomes playable) 




 The effect is still pretty insane, but it's now really overcosted since the nerf 




 Hunter otk is gone, warrior charge otk is gone, pyroblast and mages were nerfed. It's pretty clear Blizzard isn't fostering one turn kill mechanics and that they don't want them in the game. 




  but in heartstone you can win with some classes in one turn even if the other guy have 20 health and board control and there is nothing you can do about it

Not true anymore

 




 You are getting downvotes because you are whining and stating things that aren't actually correct. I did not downvote you, but I'll try to address your points fairly.

* **It's mostly luck-based.** Yes, this game is not chess, it is a card game. All card games are based on a mixture of skill and luck. Just becuase there are RNG minions, does not mean the game is total luck though. Have you ever played poker? It's a game based on calculating odds based on known and unknown factors. I'll take your mad bomber example - Let's say I have a 3/1 divine Shield, and you have 3 minions, one of which is a blood imp. Is it worth mad bombering here? How important is getting rid of your blood imp to me? Can I afford to have the bomber hit my own life total or get rid of my shield? Should I save the bomber for a more opportune moment or do I need the 3/2 body to keep tempo? Should I attack first, increasing the odds of hitting your blood imp but potentially allowing my 3/1 to be killed? Am I playing into board sweep or setting up a potentially bad trade based on what I'm anticipating you to have? Do you have Hellfire in hand?

  Sometimes your mad bomber just kills your 3/3, and yeah, that is super unlikely and really sucks, but to claim there is no strategy because of it? That is not true.

  Cards like Blood Knight are perfectly fine. It is a sick answer to a metagame dominated by argent squires to catch people unaware. A mediocre card that is really good against certain deck types - literally every competitive CCG has cards like this.

* **It's Pay-To-Win.** Hearthstone has just about the least offensive model of any CCG. Solforge? Far worse. Magic? Hahaha. The top constructed decks have around 1-5 legendary cards in them, with Druid Control generally being the most expensive. I practically have this entire deck after one or two months without spending a dime - I'm missing two of the five legendaries. Also, the legendaries AREN'T EVEN THAT GOOD OR GAMESHAPING! Most are niche cards, with exceptions being Sylvanas and maybe Rag. You do not need legendaries to be competitive. Crafting them is also very easy and not nearly as hard as you make it to be. I've crafted two legendaries in a month or two without even disenchanting anything besides duplicates. Not to mention you can craft any card you want - unlike other games where you need to just keep cracking packs.

* **One of the two game modes sits behind a paywall.** No, this is pretty much a huge exaggeration. Yes, arena costs 150 gold or $1.99. Daily quests give you anywhere from 40 to 100 gold, and you get 10 gold per 3 constructed wins. Not only that, but winning in arena GIVES YOU MORE GOLD. Going 7-3 gives you over 150 gold! Arena is far from random and very skill based. Many, many players are able to average 7-12 wins per run. Also, stating that Blizzard has reduced the rewards is just a straight up lie - they actually INCREASED them nearly across the board when they made the move to 12 being the maximum win number. I have never paid for arena and do one or more nearly every day.

So yeah, that is probably why you are getting the downvotes 




 Seriously? Solforge is pretty fun but it is super pay to win. The free to play rewards I get are most often a small amount of silver and a common I have numerous copies of. The Drafts are great, but as a f2p player expect to be able to play one every week if you're lucky.

Constructed is really dependent on legendaries (hope you got lucky and have 3 Thundersaurs!) and incredibly unbalanced - at least when N/T Shapers was completely dominant you only needed a few legendaries - Zimus, Phoenix, etc. Now that A/U Weirwood Thundersaur is the best deck by a country mile, hope you have thundersaurs, blightsteel gargoyles, 2/4 free robot guy, etc 




 It's almost like games became more complex or something 




 Sure you can, you can stop writing off people complaining about being threatened as being "pretty damn irritating" 




 Yeah, being empathetic towards other people's problem totally sucks 




 That's not true at all. It's simple, but it has a lot of decisions. Obviously it relies on random factor, but so does every card game. Arena in itself has 30 decisions just when making the deck. Then there are decisions to be made with the mulligan process, with which creature to attack, when to attack your opponent's creatures rather than go to the face, trying to predict what your opponent's possible responses to your plays are, etc. What you are saying is simply wrong 




 ok 




 Well, you've spent 60 bucks, by all means extrapolate on how you'd like to rape this guy's mother 




 The point is they actually get paid well enough to deal with that sort of bullshit 




  The fact is 90% of games are shipped broken, buggy, or half-finished. It doesn't help you go to shit like CES with amazing pre-rendered scenes, but the game never looks anything like it.

Said by someone who clearly has no idea how programming works

 




 How is it not clear that this only applies to the chuckleheads actually doing this sort of thing 




  Have you seen the hatred lobbed at Michael Bay and Justin Bieber? How about George Lucas from 1999 on? Its nothing new and certainly isn't unique to gaming.

* George Lucas net worth - 7.3 billion dollars.

* Michael Bay net worth - 400 million dollars.

* Justin Bieber net worth - 130 million dollars.


Totally fair to compare them to the Call of Duty balance patch guy who makes a 6 figure salary if he's lucky

 




 Fuck all of this "tl:dr - it's the internet, learn to deal with trolls, blah blah blah" nonsense. Not sure why it's so hard to just say that yeah this guy is right, we shouldn't be dicks 




  And I'm sick of indie developers and publishers thinking they're entitled to my money simply because they "made a game".

And you got "indie and entitled" from a guy saying he just finished working on a AAA game how? Oh right, because you didn't read the article

 




 There is a tutorial, it does a good job teaching you the basics of the game. 




 Easy. It is less complicated and more streamlined than most other card games, but still has a good amount of complexity to the game. 




 I'm sure bloggers will strictly follow those rules! Betting this game sucks 




 Nice metagame, lol 




 "Franchises we would like to see on the WiiU" 




 Looks like a guy drumming up page views with some fake F-Zero fan art to me 




 Sylvanas 




 Yeah. I might keep truesilver because it's just so good, but most of the time, I think just being able to play out a 2-3-4 or 2-2-3-4 with the coin start usually just trumps keeping a good card. Getting behind in this game is pretty brutal and I believe coming out strong is pretty important for arena.

Plus, this game 9 times out of 10 just gives you back the cards you mull anyways, so you might just get that sick 4 drop back ;) 




 Stormwind champ vs faerie dragon is close and you could probably make an argument that the champ is the better pick, especially in this deck. 




 One of those cases where it depends. Is it a 3 card or 4 card hand? What does the curve of your deck look like? How many 2 drops are you running? How awful would it be to drop your hero power turn 2? (Pally being not ideal, warrior completely awful?) Hearthstone is more complex than most make it out to be.

Yeti is obviously a top 4 drop, and if you manage to draw into something to play on turn 2/3, slamming a yeti turn 4 is obviously awesome. All I can really say is know your deck. Sometimes I'll have a deck with nuts lategame (3 flamestrikes or something like that) and not enough lower drops. In that case, I'd throw the yeti back, as I know I'd be drawing lategame power. Other times your curve just looks like a diagonal line from 2 drops down, so there I'd probably keep the yeti in hopes of out-tempoing my opponent and winning quickly.

In most general cases, I'd likely throw it back on a 3 card hand, and keep it (assuming it's the sole keeper) in a 4 card hand. I know "it depends" isn't the ideal answer, but it's the case here. 




 Pick 5: I'd take the 5/4 Taunt over mirror image, but it's probably close

Pick 6: Definitely frostbolt. Frostbolt Is one of the top cards you can get in a mage draft, murloc tidehunter is not very good.

Pick 8: Really don't like ice lance, I'd just take the 2/3.

Pick 10: Twilight Drake over counterspell. Twilight Drake often gets silenced but when he doesn't he's like a chillwind yeti or better. counterspell is ok but not as good

Pick 17: worgen infiltrator, or mana wyrm over mirror image. Not really a big mirror image fan, you probably overvalue it a bit.

Pick 18: your 2 slot is filling up but i'd probably still take faerie dragon over stormwind champ

pick 28: shieldmasta. Curve is important, but you're placing a bit too much importance on it.  Still take really good cards like shieldmasta over mediocre ones like argent squire.

pick 29: you can never have enough frostbolts

 ----------------------

Not horrible but a couple of mispicks. You don't need to deliberate over frostbolt, it's a slam every time unless there's something else like flamestrike, fireball, water elemental, etc

 




 I'll keep waiting for 10 or under, but thanks for the update! 




 Don't fret - many of us have been playing card games for almost 20 years. As long as you keep learning from making mistakes, you will keep improving.

**Step 1: Drafting your arena deck**

Look over tier lists - the following lists are very helpful references. Do not be afraid to do a few drafts directly following the tier lists. The more drafts you do, the more you will get a feel for which cards are very good and which are not, and you can deviate a bit based on personal preference.

http://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1ujhzo/antigrav1tys_arena_draft_tier_list/

http://www.ihearthu.com/trumps-arena-card-rankings/

http://www.ihearthu.com/vivafringes-guide-to-arena/

**Step 2: Draft mana curve**

Ideally, you want to balance tier lists with mana curve. Don't pass up something like Argent Commander for a mediocre 2 drop, but you want to be able to have enough 2 drops to be able to curve out (2 drop on turn 2, 3 drop on turn 3, 4 drop on turn 4). Having around 6 2 drops you can actually play on turn 2 is a good metric to start with.

Practice makes perfect. Although it's work, write down all 30 of your picks (including all 3 cards and what you chose) and post it here. You'll get a critique from a large amount of people who will quickly show you your faults - and if you don't, PM me and I'll look it over. It will be super helpful in seeing if it's the cards you're picking that's the problem.

**Step 3: Draft Classes**

Don't be afraid to pick "overpowered" classes. I pick mage every time it comes up and if mage isn't there, I'll pick paladin. The point of the game is to win. Your mileage may vary, but mage and paladin are generally considered two of the more powerful classes.

**Step 4: Mulligans**

On the play, you want to have a 2, 3, and 4 drop. On the draw, coin gives you options but try for a 2-2-3-4, 2-4-4, or a 3-3-4 start. You generally always want a 2 drop in hand. If you draw 3 4 drops, mull them all, unless one is something really insane. Anything over 4 do not keep is a good arena rule of thumb.

**Step 5: Gameplay**

Always be thinking of what gets you the most value. At worst you want to trade one of your cards for theirs. In general you want to look to get added value. Getting 2 cards with one of yours is how you win games. If you play a shattered sun cleric and trade with the 3/3 taunt bear, you get small value because you traded a 3 drop for a 3 drop but still have the battlecry on another creature. Small value adds up and wins games.

Finally, don't give up - once it clicks, you'll be rattling off 8+ wins every time. Good luck 




 I totally disagree. if this guy can't string together more than 3 wins in arena, the first thing he should do is strictly emulate the guides to see what approaches are known to work. 

Once he gets the basics down and experiences some success, your advice has merit, but until then, if he just plays the way he feels like he won't magically get better. 




 EUIV on sale any time soon? 




 Black Knight is a literal game winner. Eating a shieldmasta or sunwalker is such a huge tempo shift. Worst case he's an expensive Chillwind Yeti, which is obviously worse than Illidan, but it isn't very hard to get insane value from him.

Illidan usually needs to survive a turn to provide good value, otherwise he is kind of mediocre. The Beast is usually just pretty bad. Usually just eats removal and gives your opponent a free guy. 




 [Gallipoli](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082432/)? 




 Why would it be so awful to give every arena deck equal opportunity to be great instead of having to get lucky enough to get the class cards for a good run.

That exists, it's called playing constructed 




 Yeah, 3 is probably ideal, but depending on what the other two cards are, I wouldn't feel too awful taking more than that.

Let's be real, if I was handed a mage deck with 5 flamestrikes, I probably wouldn't complain too hard. 




 Great list, minor disagreements here and there. As mage I do not agree with maxing out flamestrikes at 2. 




 I used towerofthehand.com as my reference. It allows you to put what the last book you finished as a scope, so it will avoid spoilers. 




 Solution: If you don't like playing buggy unfinished games, stop buying games in early access 




 Totally a mystery why people would pick the best arena class if given the option 




 Setting challenges for reading is great, 50 is about double what I'll read this year most likely. Not sure I'd be a huge fan of only being able to read US born authors for an entire year, however. 




 I feel it's fine where it is. It's fairly weak unless you have lots of pump and not a card I'm super happy to pick. 




 The Third Bear by Jeff Vandermeer 




 Blizzard, hotfix the game immediately, we need to take Ice Block out because it's the only card guy who has been playing for four days has a problem losing to 




 **Hearthstone!** 

Blizzard's TCG wildly surpassed my expectations, arena is tons of fun, and I'm really looking forward to seeing where Blizzard takes it next year and into the future. 




 It is also incredible - most underrated game of the year, and in my personal top ten list. If you like old school platformers, particularly Ghouls n Ghosts, snap pick this up 




 Yeah, I see the appeal (though not for me) and liking it is one thing, but I can't imagine people enjoying it so much that it made their top ten lists. Have people here put hours into Divekick? Is there an active online community to it?

In a year with so many good games, I just question seeing it listed above some others. 




 Yes, it is much better than the original 2/2

Yes, hunters are awful

Yes, it wouldn't make hunters OP

No, Blizzard will not buff up a card to be better than the original version of a card they just nerfed about a month ago (hunters were pretty awful back then too) 




 You really think Blood Imp would be a lot better as a 2/2 without stealth? If so I doubt you understand why it's good in the first place. Just because people are currently packing bad cards like Fan of Knives to deal with Warlock Rush doesn't mean that a 1/1 stealth with a super powerful ability would be worse than a plain 2/2 that literally dies to nearly anything other than a hero ability 




 That's besides the point, why would they make a card they just nerfed better than it was originally? 




 Why is Divekick in so many top 10 lists? 




 Making it 1/1 stealth makes it much more powerful than it was originally at 2/2. More powerful than Blood Imp most likely 




 To be fair sacrificial pact at its best is killing your opponents demon for free, which is pretty sick. Card is still awful don't get me wrong 




 Card advantage is important, but the MOST important thing in this game is tempo and curve. In arena, if you miss a turn 1 and 2 drop on the play and don't have a plan, like a turn 4 hellfire or consecration, most cases you won't be able to keep up with a t1 coin into a 2 drop t2 2 drop t3 3 drop t4 4 drop.

From there, it's all about getting card advantage and making value trades. Rarely is there any "drop it and I win" cards like mtg (Gideon Jura in Rise draft, baneslayer angel, etc) 




 Nothing better than sorry spamming a sorry spammer when they preemptively, aggressively, GG you. 




 I am really bothered by the coin sitting in your hand on turn 6+ 




 Puppy Games are an awesome dev, great fresh takes on old school arcade games. Ultratron is a great Robotron 2084 knockoff. I recommend the bundle even though I'm not a fan of having to BTA for steam keys. 




 DO YOU LIKE TO PLAY WITH FIIIIRRE 




 hex 




 This card is currently not playable in constructed, but can be a very good card in arena. It is deck dependent, but in a shaman, paladin, or a low curve deck with lots of guys, it can be insane.

Regarding it being win-more, I don't think that is true. Just because you have minions on board does not mean you are winning. When you drop him, it allows you to instantly make favorable trades and get a ton of value. It lets you trade a 2-drop 2/3 and a 1/1 paladin token for something like a chillwind yeti. In this case you might even be behind on board, and the champion lets you surge back with all sorts of favorable trades.

If you are slightly winning, he lets you get even more value, wipe any threats they have while trading up, and secures his own safety from on board minions. If your opponent does not instantly deal with him, you will likely win.

Certainly an underrated arena card IMO. 




 I don't know about that 




 Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes might be worth checking out then 




 You don't think it would be incredibly rude if InXile offered up beta access to all for much cheaper than what actual backers paid the moment it came out? People would have their pitchforks ready. 




 If you think that $60 is too much to ask to opt into a beta, then just wait until release. For them to release the game at any less of a price would be spitting in the face of the people who are the largest fans and backed them on Kickstarter.

The game is speculated to be in the $20-30 range on release, so I don't see what the big deal is.

 




 yeah, it was a totally innocent question too, totally not implying anything 




 The comment thread here literally makes me want to vomit. Could you guys try and dismiss this any harder? Some assholes jack off into this dev's phone and all you can talk about is how she probably faked the whole thing?

 "Cyber Self Harm" (It weirdly exists http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25120783) as it's pretty easy to garner sympathy that way. If it is option b I don't get why she elected to do it on such a small image board, maybe it's because like I said a thread about this on /v/ was just full of people who had no idea who she was.


 Could possibly be option B. How did the image board get that photo of her?


 this seems to be a quest for attention


 blowing it out of proportion


 We can discuss it and condemn them all we went but that won't change a thing.


 As a developer is listing your gender a requirement to get something Green-lighted?


 To me it sounds all fishy...


 she didn't have to state that she was female


 I have a feeling that SJW's are going to use minimal or fake "backlash" or harassment to garner more attention to their creative endeavors


 The victim complex is a million dollar industry for feminism, and you're just seeing it take root in their newest infection via gaming


 With that said, I'm skeptical of this.


Fucking Shameful.

Edit: and the mods actually put misleading title on this....fuck this sub
 




 stop condoning/dismissing the behavior 




  EDIT: And then I fire the catapult during their turn. Does the opponent see you mess with the board items?

no

psych 




 Contender for most over-hyped game of the year. It was an interesting concept and isn't a bad game per say, but when it came out all I heard was rave reviews and comparisons of this being the next Portal. I bought in, played it for a couple of hours, smirked a few times, and never went back to it. 




 Any comments on how the PC port is? 




 If you do daily quests and are competent at the game you can bust out 1-2 arenas a day. Within a month you will have a good collection, all for free. 




 and so is the individual card limit. 




 It's still 1112 cards vs. 381. 5 times the number of sets may have been misleading although true.

A lot of what you say is pretty misleading as well though. You can't simply discount manafixing, non-basics, etc as "not cards". You can't write off trash, unplayable, limited fodder in MTG without also doing it for Hearthstone. 




 But it's still 5 times the number of sets that hearthstone has available. 




 Lol, look at some MTG standard top 8s lately and you'll realize that's not quite true 




 Because it's popular and people like to be hip and contrarian 




 Because it's an aesthetic choice? Better looking is relative to you. Give me pixels over polygons any day. 




 Maybe it's because some people like these types of games 




 Be prepared to be burnt at the SJW stake!

 http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Davies

He was on lost 




 Yeah I appreciate the backup, just pointing out this guy is clueless 




 he's taking 7 turn 2, and if you arcane intellect turn 3 he's taking 9. That leaves him at 14 and even if he SW:D's your 5/3 wurm, you still have a 4/3 ready to bash him next turn.

I agree it is deck dependent, but if it's burn mage he isn't going to be playing many guys at all and a turn 4 fireball gets the priest to 3 life, card advantage is moot at this point 




 I'm aware

 




 his suggestion was actually

what? wyrm is only 1 mana if you are going to coin on turn 1 why not

Wyrm, coin, mirror image

on turn 2
wyrm mirror image

turn 3

Arcane int.

 




  the guy i was originally replying to said:
 TURN 1
 Wyrm Coin
 Turn 2
 wyrm mirror image.

I definitely didn't say that

 




 So from turn 3 on you just don't play anymore spells until they die?  




 But if he has a SWP he's killing your t1 wurm anyways. 2 SWPs ruins your day, but why would a priest even keep that hand against a mage? 




 Coining into 2 wurms turn 1 gives you 3 additional turn 2 damage at the cost of -1 attack to the second wurm. You would need to get in hits with the second wurm on turns 3, 4, 5, and 6 for coining on turn 2 to be more damage efficient.

TBH I think the difference between the 2 plays is REALLY small anyways so not that it makes much of a difference. 




 so on turn 2 you'd rather have a 4/3 and a summoning sick 2/3 than a 4/3 and a 3/3 that are both able to attack? 




 Interesting line, not sure if it's better to coin on turn 1 or 2. Turn 1 gives you 3 extra damage on turn 2 at the cost of a -1 attack on one of your wurms.

Keeping the wurms at 4 seems good, but assuming it's constructed and not arena, SW:D isn't that highly played anymore (or is it? seems like I've been seeing less and they aren't very good), and you are going to get SW:P'd on his turn 2 if he has it regardless. 




 * T1 wurm - coin - wurm

* T2 mirror entirty -  mirror entity

* T3 arcane intellect, or one of your drawn spells if it gives you a better option


Leaving you with a 5/3 and 4/3 with 4 0/2 taunts the priest is going to struggle to get through. I don't think you wait to play the second mirror entity. Maybe if he has a SW:P turn 2 to kill one of your wurms, but even then I think I'd still just jam both of them out.

 




 It is way better than both of those cards. Assuming it's early in the draft and we're just picking best card, I'll take it over average cards like razorfen hunter, bloodsail raider, reckless rocketeer, etc 




 You don't use the whole card in the example though. Slime is irrelevant to the issue 




 If you need it explained, you get 2+ uses out of eaglehorn bow 




 more like 1.5 cards 




 It isn't a card I'd pick over anything else in arena, but it's definitely a great arena card I'd never be unhappy playing. 




 Magic has its own large set of problems, ranging from social retardation to smug prickish undeserved elitism 




 I never use "well played" unless I lost and you didn't say it yet, or in response to a "well played" from the loser.

Otherwise it feels like aggressive GGing 




 It is definitely a cumulative experience - the more you read, the more you want to read, and the easier it becomes. Find an author or genre you like to read and start there, but don't be afraid to branch out into new genres or experiences. Reading is the best, welcome.

 As much as I really despise the direction Final Fantasy has taken, it's pretty unfair to compare sales of a series spinoff to one of the numbered entries.

 Then just concede against priests and requeue - problem solved. Just because you don't find playing as or against control fun doesn't mean it should be stricken from the game. 




 It's one of the best cards in the game, I would just craft them. If you're totally free-to-play, you might crack 2 in packs nearly right away, or it could take you months to crack a set. 




 You can always find a way to scum the system. However, the playtime will certainly help more than it will hurt the case of people lying about how much they have played the game. 




 I think they should work on adding a filter to which scores get counted and displayed for you- things like "at least X hours of playtime in game", "at least X games owned", "at least X reviews submitted", "X% of achievements completed", etc.

You can set the default on these and have most users be fine with it, but adding the filters can only help. 




 yeah, that's definitely not true
