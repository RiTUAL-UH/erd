 Every time I try to vote on something, it says "Your vote cannot be cast at this time".  Why? 























































































































 The guy buying all of the stock thinks that slavery is morally wrong, but only sees one way out of it for them.  He "buys" them, then sets them free.  Tells them to head north, and gives them a compass, and a watch. 


































 I came to a stop, put my rig in neutral, set the brake, and ran out and saw if the dude was OK. He was fine, but the engines shit out on him, so I called 911. I was a few counties over in Shoshone county. I damned near shit a brick because a DAMNED PLANE ALMOST LANDED ON ME!  That dude scared the fucking shit out of me.  I heard a "WUNK" on my roof, so I backed off, (what the fuck was that?) then I hear the plane again, and it touches down. 

 HOLY SHIT!  DOWNSHIFT!  DROP THE CLUTCH, NEURAL! 911!  OH FUCK  I'M GONNA KILL THIS GUY!  OH SHIT!  I stopped 30 yards back.  Then I'm on the phone after I see if the guy is still alive.  Scary shit!  STAY NEXT TO THE PLANE!  STAY STILL!  Turns out he ran out of gas, and had to land, so he just went for the nearest highway, and he accidently tried landing on me.  After he hit my roof, he took another pass, (faster), and landed ahead.  WTF?  

**EDIT:** paragraphs 









 Right now, shit's going real bad.  I'm about ready to be homeless, and the only thing I'll have left is what I can haul on my back, and my cat.  Unless change happens really soon, I'm going to end up homeless, and I'll be resorted to armed robbery to pay the bills.  My SIL is even leaving.  I don't know what to do, but I'm going to soon lose everything unless shit changes really fast.  The thought of doing a hostile takeover because of an emergent situation has never occurred to me, but I'm about ready to go knock over a service station.  Right now, I basically have nothing to lose, so why keep alive? 





































































 Except for potentially killing myself if I build it wrong, what If I do it, and set it off?  Also, how to do so safely in town?  OK, I might build 2, and torch them off, but what would happen if I got caught?  Is it worth the risk?  I wouldn't be using them as weapons, just to make a hell of a boom, (and run like my ass is on fire because nitro). 
























 Drop trou, and fuck it in the ass. 














 Since tasers are LTL options, (like I as a civillian have the option of pommelling you with my knife, or turning it around and spearing you with it, and after that drawing a gun and stopping you), but if I pommeled a person to stop a threat, (Ideally I don't want to get that close if I have to use it), I would be arrested if I hit somebody in the temple and accidently killed them even if it was self-defense.  Then released because if I'm drawing a weapon and was using proper escalation of force, then no charges filed in WA state).

But what happens if a cop pulls a taser, uses it, and the guy drops dead?  Would an investigation occur?  I personally won't pull anything on anybody unless I intend on using it, and am pretty sure I might have to. 














 Such as lines instead of saying "Then I told him that he's clueless", they wrote something like "All y'all don't know jack shit, eh?  Fuck ya!" 









 Oh, and what's your thoughts to "Not yet.  I just got off of work, I'm going home to do exactly that."  I got stopped 4 days ago because my headlight was out of alignment and I was apparently blinding him when I passed.  He smiled when I said that, then it was back to business.  Now I have to figure out how to re-align my head light. 









 The only time I was terminated from a job, (and borderline suicidal), I used my sunglasses to hide my emotions  They couldn't tell anything was wrong since I had my eyes covered. 





























 Then a police officer grabs me, (one hand on my shoulder, and one hand on my right hand to restrain me).  Why did he do that?  I spun around and was about ready to deck the guy because I though somebody was going to rob me, but I stopped once I recognized that it's a cop, and not somebody going to rob/assault me.  So why did he feel the need to mildly restrain me, to risk getting punched in the face?  

Once I saw it was a city officer, I stood down, but I thought it was some random dude trying to stop me from getting away from the several mortars about ready to shoot off.  He should have shouted over his bull horn, eh?

He asked me if I owned this road, and told him "no, but nobody else is using it eh?  so I'm setting off fireworks."  He stood there and watched the fireworks with me, then ran my background info, then told me not to set off fireworks in a public roadway.

  Then he told me to pack up my shit and go to the parking lot if I'm intent on setting off fireworks, so I did.  He shook his head, and took off. 




 Ever since updating to 10051, the start menu doesn't work, and nor does Project Spartan.  I ran sfc /scannow, to try and fix it, but that didn't do anything for those two issues. 



















 How do I fix it?  I can still launch shit with the search function, but start is completely non-functional. 




 Stopping people for minor traffic violations, (didn't signal, broken headlight on passenger side, and turned into the far lane) just to get a verbal warning, and when they stick their head in the rig, it's obvious that they're trying to smell drugs/alcohol, so I suspect that was the "real reason" for the stop?

Is that a thing, or am I paranoid?  No, I wasn't drinking, Just nobody was there, so I pulled into the left lane.  I got let off and basically told "don't do that", then sent on my merry way.  This just happened, if it helps. 




 Such as a brown bear, you make yourself bigger and charge it if you can.  The bear will likely be scared off, as it now thinks you're a threat to it

Dogs, slowly back off while not turning your back, always locking eyes with it, (if you turn and run, it will kill you).

Large cats, you stop moving, and slowly back off, never losing eye contact.  Get to safety, but slowly.  If you run, you're now the prey, and it will kill you.

Gators, RUN. If you run your ass off, they'll give up after a few meters.  Try and stare down a gator, you're not gonna have a good day. 




 While driving down the road, how do police decide to not stop somebody going VERY FAST (2-3 times the speed limit, running lights (reasonably safely, but emergently) , and blaring his horn and having on the 4 ways while flashing his high beams), Is it because he's on the phone to 911 and talking to dispatch as it happens "live", or some other reason?

When my wife cut her hand on a stupid-ass soup can, I was honestly faster than the ambulance, so "get in my truck and buckle up.  We're hauling ass".  After she got in my rig, I went 65 through town through 20 zones, and police actually got out of my way.  

I was heading the most direct rout for the hospital that I possibly could, and had my 4 ways on and was jumping lights.  I think it was pretty damned obvious that it was an emergency, ( I normally don't drive like that,  eh?)  But they knew to get out of my way and close down intersections somehow.  Is it because I was on the phone to dispatch ( 911 ), while I was rushing to the hospital as fast as I felt safe going?  

No, I didn't jump lights if it was unsafe, but if there was a gap, I did the left, right forward?  CLEAR  thing?  While I ran several lights, and wouldn't have stopped until the hospital, (then surrendered, because somebody bleeding to death on me), everybody (including several emgergency vehicles were just getting out of my way.  About half way there, I got a lead rig and a pilot rig.  How did they know that I needed a police escort when all I gave on the phone was present location, description of the vehicle, license plate number, and direction of heading?  How the fuck did the cops know not to stop me, clear the roads, and take me to the hospital? 





























 How does one adopt non-local vernacular?  I've adopted several sayings, and I honestly have no clue where I got them from.  I'm a native to Eastern WA, (Whitman County).  I've managed to pick up the following words and I don't know how or why:

Buggy = "shopping cart"

Y'all = "You all / you guys / you"

Eh? = "Huh? / what? / right? / yeah?"

Sup = "What's up?"

Pillock = "Dick"

Arse = "ass"

Thank god I didn't adopt "cunt", or "hoser", eh? 

Sorry if this a "shit post", (whatever the hell that is), but I don't know where else to ask this.

And why don't people know what a buggy is?  I don't get it.  "shopping cart" now sounds dumb to me. 









 Because God doesn't trust the English in the dark, eh? 
























 I have 2GB of RAM installed, if it matters. 
























 To me, it's a 4 wheeled thing you shove around a store to load your shit in.  I met an Alaskan today, and he thinks it's a strange moterized vehicle that looks like a rock crawler, but designed for mud.  Around here, we call those  "rock crawlers".

He was talking about how much shit he can fit in his buggy, and I was getting confused, so I said "buggy?  you mean that thing that you do this with in stores?", (did the buggy shoving gesture).  He then tried to describe what he meant, but I still had to guess.  I had no clue what he was talking about for about 3 min, until I asked, "like a rock crawler?" 




 Like "g CZ52" and it goes through Google, but if I type "b CZ52", it does the same search but through bing? 




 If I do it, it's armed robbery and I face 10-life. If the government does it, it's tax collection, and publicly applauded. 




 A black hole. Because once you go black, you never come back. 





























 Why not?  I have it connected through FB.

 No, it's more like this:

**"Old Atheism"**

Guy 1:  I don't believe in god.

Guy 2:  Shut up, and go along to get along.  

Guy 1:  OK

****"New Atheism"****

Guy 1:  I don't believe in god.

Guy 2:  Shut up. Go along to get along.

Guy 1:  No.  Why don't you shut up about your god?

Guy 2:  PERSECUTION!  YOU HATE GOD!

Guy 1:  No more than you hate Thor.

Guy 2:  THAT IS OF THE DEVIL!  OF COURSE I HATE THOR!!

Guy 1:  OK, no more than you hate Bigfoot.

Guy 2:  Bigfoot isn't real.

Guy 1:  Exactly.

Guy 2:  ..... 
























 In WA, I don't think I can conceal my ka-bar, (because of the "dangerous weapons" law, but in ID, I can, so long as I have an ID LCCW, or WA CPL.  I called the police, and while I can open carry basically anything I want, I can't "Furtively" carry any dangerous weapon, (except pistol since I'm licensed to do so).  So why the law difference?

Also, is it a good idea to inform, even though I don't have to?  I got in a collision back in 2012, and an officer responded.  After asking for DL/reg/ins, 

I gave him all the paperwork, and also gave him my CPL, and told him that "Since I'm armed today, here is my CPL."  He just looked at it, asked me where it as, and said "cool, if you don't touch yours, I won't touch mine."  I didn't care, but I felt like I should inform the officer even if I legally don't have to. 



















 I was formally employed as a cashier/assembler/toy sales associate/cart associate/freight unloader at Walmart, and recently left that job.  I got a new job as a landscape maintenance technician, and MY GOD, the labor is hard work!

Before I worked at Walmart, I was a car wash guy, and before that, I was a groundskeeper.  I don't remember how long it took me to adjust to manual labor, so I'm asking here.  It's Saturday, and my muscles still hurt from the work week. 


















































































































 Free food and free housing for the rest of his life, so why not do it? 




 They figure.  "Fine, want to fine us for being "anti-competitive"?  Fine by me.  I'll just "delete" the last 20 years of technological progress from the average consumer perspective." 




 Some people are wondering where Montgomery Ward's is, as it was just there yesterday, but now it turned into a Big 5 overnight. 









 Just for shits and grins, I burnt a DVD, and decided to re-install.  A USB drive takes all of 20 min, (max), but from a DVD, it takes over an hour to install the OS.  MS should by default provide USB drives to install the OS, and have them fill out a form if they want a DVD, (like was done until Windows XP, with shipping CD's and including a card that if you want FDD's to write MS)

MS should transition to USB installation.  Installing W10 with a DVD is the first time I've even used that drive since 2010. 
























 Some of them are wondering where Montgomery Ward's is, because it used to be there yesterday, but it's now a Big5 over night. 
























  Violators of the curfew order will be arrested on site. Rioters, looters, and arsonists will be shot on site.   









 They wouldn't march next year. 









 I think there was an aqua-car int he movie, but it's been about 20 years since Ive seen it, so I don't remember.  I think Kevin Costner was in it.  It came out WAY before "The Postman". 



























































 I tried to replace the front glass, (not very sucessfull).  I got the front glass off, but the LCD was still stuck to the screen, even after heating it up with a hair dryer.  at first, none of the buttons except for power and volUp and VolDn were working, so I took apart the phone completly, (MB, and screen/bezel assembly as one unit) and noticed that a connecter came loose on the touch screen link to the lower buttons.  

I got the home, menu, and back buttons to work again, but I still can't use the touch screen at all.  It simply doesn't recognize input.  Is there a way to fix the touch screen?  It displays everything fine, but input via touch is now impossible.  Is there a connecter that I may have missed?  I would like to not spend $71 if I don't have to buy a new front screen/bezel assembly.

**EDIT:**  Well, now that I tore it apart again, and put it back together, the phone won't turn on at all.  :(  Fuck.  Now it looks like I'm going to have to buy one. :(  I'm now back to my backup phone, which is a i997 flashed with CM11 (unofficial) 4.4.4.  Do you think I EMPed it by accident? Even plugging it in, it won't signify charging at all. 



















 

The phone identifies as an i9300 in the sticker in the back of the phone, and in the ROM. However, when I boot into download mode, it shows up as an i747, and trying to flash a i9300 ROM fails. Is there a way to resolve this? 




 MS!  GET RID OF THE "LESS OPTIONS" IN TASK MANAGER!  It's Fucking USELESS!  I can't use it for shit!  "More Options" should be the default, (and only option for task manager).  The way it's set up now, it's little more useful than the task bar!  If I go Ctrl+Shift+Escape, I WANT THE FUCKING TASK MANAGER!  WHY DO YOU TORTURE US LIKE THIS?  

The way its used now is fucking retarded and useless!  Get rid of it!  Bring the old style back!  OK, done rant now.  But seriously, whoever thought of that needs to be bitch slapped! 









 "Fuck the police!"  I'm not talking about spouting off at the mouth, but making his land a deadly trap to anything that moves.  Anything that intrudes is shot on site.  Now what?  They will not be negotiated with.  They have RPG-7's, and aren't afraid to use them.  Prisoners ar taken, and severely tortured on live TV before execution. 



















 Example:  We got in WWII because of the Jewish holocaust.

No, we didn't.  We didn't even recognize them until 1943, when the war machine was starting to lose support, so it was revealed to the American public about execution camps, so we must fight the evil. The USA actually turned back Jewish refugees in 1938, because we didn't want them either.  (Source:  http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267 ) 

We REALLY got involve in WWII because we embargoed the japs for oil, so we got struck in the territory of HI, so we declared war on them.  Then, since JP was allied with GE, they declared war on us.  Boom!  WWII.  The rest is history as we know it.

Anyhow, how do these modern propaganda stories get passed down as fact, when they are incredibly wrong, and why do people believe it, when even a modicum of research would prove it wrong? 




 If you aren't liberal, you're "not a true atheist". The only thing missing is worship of a deity. Oh wait, most "practicing" atheists these days do worship something. Government has taken the place of a god. So it's a secular religion for most "practitioners" of atheism. If you don't comply to the "doctrine", you will be rooted out, and banned on FB. Small minds think alike, eh? Yeah, they're "tolerant", so long as you agree with them. 




   Would Obama start cussing to nobody in particular while live on the air?  How far would he get before the networks cut away from him or he realized he was uttering a stream of profanities before he stopped talking and left the stage? 

















































 My cat is an indoor cat, but a few times she has gotten outside, she doesn't even leave the property, and when I had her at my old place, (an apartment), she never left the stoop of my place.  

But she swill wants outside even though she never leaves my property, (a tenth of an acre).  She even restricts herself to the front lawn when she does get out. She's not a wanderer, so why does she even want out?  When the weather's nice, I leave open a couple of windows so she can look out, but she still wants out. 









 It is done so nobody calls the air force to report a UFO and strange lights all over America that cause the sky to glow all night long for over 4 weeks.  (basically "Oooh, look at the pretty lights!" is what it is passed off as).

But here's the catch:  The test is really to see what a HEMP would do the CONUS, and the test is not only hailed as a "progress of mankind" or some such bullshit, but it's really a covert mission to EMP the entire USA before the fucking Russians can do it, just to take the "wind out of their sails".

Now what? 




 Russian hands, and Roman fingers.
