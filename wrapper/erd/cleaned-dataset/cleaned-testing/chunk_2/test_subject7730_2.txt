 Woody's channel would then be the equivalent to the sahara desert. 




 Is it on Netflix? 




 I just wanted to know, cause the show needs a little more salt in its game. 




 I thought you were correcting my spelling, but it was correct and I just didn't know what you were trying to convey. Good day sir. 




 "They just cracked inter-dimensional travel" 




 ??? 




 This is a suggestion for the PKA crew to watch. Woody, in PKA 238, said he wanted to stream movies and I immediately thought of Black Mirror. WATCH EPISODE TWO, this is a tv show like 'The Twilight Zone' only it is a more modern, rated-r version. I would love you guys to give theories on what you think the second episode (the best episode) symbolizes because there is a lot a room for interpretation.

Edit: I think Kyle may have mentioned this show before on PKA. He may have already seen it so idk. 




 After the fiasco on PKA 238, where 98% of viewers were screaming map names at their computer screens. I have engineered a link of sorts that will resolve any future map name struggles. Your welcome.

 You know, it wouldn't be hard at all for woody to literally search 'MW2 Maps' on google. 




 Why? there are a bunch of tutorials on how to moon walk 




 Be black. 




 I don't know what made me laugh harder, your comment or your username.

 10/10 would laugh again 




 I wouldn't risk it bro.  




 Dude, worse could have happened, trust me. Just wait about a month and no one will ever remember that you said that. It really wasn't even a scumbag thing to say in the joking atmosphere. Don't worry about it. 




 Good ol' anvil jokes 




 I cosign with this suggestion. It really was great Netflix original, very dark. 




 You might be my long lost twin...Hello brother. 




 Gotta keep in mind that they are just friends that are having a conversation, not your AP U.S History teachers. 




 That's really selfish dude. There are about 200,000 or so of us and I, for one, do not enjoy this topic and I DEFINITELY know that I am not alone.  




 WTF are you trying to articulate??? 




 50's 




 What kind of dog is that? 




 Only problem is that these subs only have like 2,000 subscribers and max 25 people on at a given time :( 




 Thanks for posting this! 




 None of them allow you to post your own music. If they do please let me know where you post. I make Hip-Hop beats 




 It really is annoying :( 




 It seems like you get on sub-reddits like WeAreTheMusicMakers and I can't even show what I have created. Kind of frustrating to see every subreddit I encounter discourage self posting. Anyway, where can I post my music? Which sub-reddits?

Edit: I'm a Hip-Hop/Rap Music Producer 









 If you have 1 video and split it in to like 8 videos, but get a fourth of the views of the original on each of the 8 videos he'd still be making twice as much money.  









 I actually charge $25 for a basic lease. PM me if you're still interested! 




 Woody probably still going to do short clips, Gotta get that money. 




 Annnnnnd Fuck your Poll it is! Love those style of videos!
