 Cherylee by Gowns on spotify, second half of the song is powerful 




 John Frusciante's solo in Wet Sand by Red Hot Chili Peppers or the face melting solo in Alive by Mike McCready of Pearl Jam 




 What's your favorite short song? I'm gonna set the limit as anything 3:00 or shorter, I think that's reasonable enough to be considered short. So what're your favorites? I think the top on many people's list might be Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin, but I think my favorite is Songbird by Oasis, great summer tune. 




 As soon as saw this as a topic I knew it'd be about these lines of the song. If I were green I would die just fits the melody. It's the same thing as misheard lyrics to me. In Pearl Jam's song Yellow Ledbetter, Eddie says, "but they don't wave" but it legitimately sounds like "potato wave". We all know it's not potato wave but it sure as hell sounds like it. 




 I'm in love with their ability to tell a story that can draw emotional responses from the listener 




 That Western Skyline or A Little Bit of Everything by Dawes 




 John Frusciante's cover of How Deep Is Your love, originally by the Bee Gees

This is so awesome, John is so talented, love this guy. 




 Wow, yes it is still on netflix, I checked, looks super intriguing, thanks. 




 RHCP is in my current top 5 bands, I love those dudes, I dont care if reddit thinks they've fallen off either 




 Helllll yes, I love early hip hop, this is gonna be awesome 




 If this isn't a documentary about Kevin Federline as a backup dancer than I don't wanna watch it. Nah, I'm kidding, thanks for the netflix link. 




 hmm I'm not familiar with any of these, that can only be good news 




 Hmm first 3-4 albums you say? I'll give it a whirl 




 Definitely looking forward to seeing the Talking Heads, I don't know much about them really, pretty obscure fellows I imagine 




 Hopefully this will help me understand the punk scene more! Thanks for the suggestion 




 AWESOME, I'm a fan of all these dudes, can't wait, thanks 




 They recently came to Hershey, PA. Near where I'm from, and I think some people said they put on a pretty good show. I'm not a fan of theirs myself, but I can appreciate good showmanship 




 I love watching documentaries, and I love music and I've watched a few rock docs. Can anyone suggest any good rock docs that discuss music from any time frame between the 50's and now? I like when they are specifically talking about genres or artists, but I wouldn't mind a documentary discussing multiple genres at once and how their fan bases felt towards each other, and how it effected the genre in all. 




 Ayyyyy a Marina fan, I see you kid  




 Spotify has allowed me to broaden my horizons so immensely, I'm very thankful for it 




 Gnarly amigo, that's what I like to hear 




 This song is so gnarly, too bad only one album was ever made. 




 Ahhh!!!!!!! I totally had a similar situation with Black! It was always one of my favorites, but after a certain situation it actually made tears swell in my ears and I had trouble listening to those exact lyrics.

Sage Francis from his new album. "May the bridges that we burn light the way"

And lastly Johnny Cash's cover of Hurt in combination with his music video is heavy shit. "You can have it all, this empire of dirt" as his hand is trembling and pour out a drink onto the ground. 




 I was in England at the time she died, and there was a bunch of hooplah, but I frankly didn't care a whole lot. I don't know why I'm not a fan, it could be because she dated a bum and she shoplifted tabloid magazines, but I guess that shouldn't affect my opinion of her as a musician, but oh well, it does. 




 Hmm, its easy to see the benefits. I would envision that this would grant the new player base experience in going forward with their gameplay.  




 Ahh it was a low budget (relatively speaking) indie film that received all great reviews as far as I know. I think the movie is awesome. Anyways... I always, for some reason thought the song "Satellite" always seemed like a narrative for the movie District 9. I dont know... something about this combination always made me think they clicked together.  




 Thats actually the song I had in mind when you mentioned Rise Against, debatably my top 3 song of theirs. Ok Sephiroth, I have a question, have you ever seen District 9? 




 I've always admired Rise Against's lyricism, good lyric choice 




 I really liked Copper Gone by Sage Francis and Southsiders by Atmosphere 




 That was awesome 




 Ahh gotcha, thanks man, I was trying to get a general gist of what people thought, and this makes sense to me. 




 Hey guys, I was just wondering  what all of your guys' favorite Frusciante songs. I dig Central, Murderers, The Mirror, Before the Beginning, Time Goes Back, and The Past Recedes. Those are my top 5 probably in no particular order.  




 Mariah Carey

 Ahh, so I guess that's why it's never brought up :P Thanks for the heads up man. I also totally dig the album, and Greenwood rips the tits off his guitar. I guess now I'll just sit and wait for my ass kicking. 




 Hey all, I've been browsing the music subreddit for only about a week or so and I've seen a bunch of Radiohead fans (not really a surpirse), however, most of the discussion I've seen has been about OK Computer or Kid A, deservedly so. I was just curious as to what the community thought about Pablo Honey, being there first album and all. Creep doesn't need to be mentioned, but you all probably already knew that. 

One of my favorite tracks is definitely "You". Yorke's voice just incredibly shreds through the song and gives me awesome chills and I'm left amazed. I just thought I'd make this quick point.

Anyways, I was just wondering what the general feeling of this album was, cheers. 




 Michael Jackson, why do you call Sprite "Jesus juice?" 




 Keith Moon - Wanna grab a beer since we have the same birthday? And maybe we can talk about your Holiday Inn story 




 The first time I heard contact I was actually blown away by the build up, I thought it was Sooo good, but you're right it almost feels like the the rest of the song is anticlimactic. 




 Hmm and I only like the first half of Touch... Maybe RAM wasn't the best choice on second thought 




 Hey not a bad remix to it, you definitely did enough adjusting to "make it your own" so to speak. 




 I've only listened through it once so far, and it seemed like if you like Rise Against, you'll probably like this album. It didn't seem to stray too far from the norm, which is fine. I was just wondering what the community on here thought about it. Thanks. 




 Motherboard on Random Access Memories didn't do much for me 




 I agree, I think I get the message that Radiohead was trying to convey, but I wouldn't say it ruined the album. I definitely could have done without it though. 




 Open Happiness by a collective of artists 




 you're awesome

 It can sometimes be hard to pull off a tribute song that is really as cohesive as this one. Slug did an awesome job. R.eye.P 









 The intro of "Stranglehold" by Ted Nugent. As soon as you hear that you know I'm in the zone and about to show you a girthy yet humble 6.4 inch dong slice 




 I stopped filling it out once I saw Mac miller with more votes than slug 




 O.A.R. Are one of my summer bands 




 As if I needed another reason to love Eddie. 




 Yep I'm not sure if it's still on there, but yeah we started watching it as a joke, then we decided to stop ha 




 Lost me at Avril lavigne, and made me want to kill myself at Bieber. 

EDIT: just saw Bruno Mars (I'm dead) 




 Skalett Johansson 




 FIZZZ LESS'GO 




 The only thing I could think to hide is when my roommate and I watched the first 10 minutes "Nude Nuns with Big Guns". I could not wait to get that off my previously watched list. 




 Fancy - Iggy Azalea 




 Ahh sorry to hear that man, truly I am. It's also good that you have BB to turn to that can bring back good memories. 




 Bringing back the memories of listening to Breaking Ben. First heard of them playing Halo 2 and their song "Blow Me Away" was in the campaign.  




 Thanks fellas, I'm going to check these out ASAP 




 Piano Man by Billy Joel, American Pie by Don McLean, Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, and Under the Bridge by Red Hot Chili Peppers 




 I re-watched School of Rock the other day, and it has always been one of my favorite movies from when I was growing up (come at me). I think I first watched it when I was in middle school. I can still remember that scene where "Bonzo Goes to Bitburg" by the Ramones is playing and Jack Black is basically teaching his students everything about the History of Rock, and what a huge impact this scene had on me the first time I watched it. This was the first moment I can remember really getting into music, and it was because of this scene. With Freddy watching live performances of the The Who's Keith Moon, and Jack Black filling the blackboard with hundreds of bands and connecting their genres and influences. It was just incredible to me. So after re-watching it, I wanted to know some of the best live/historic performances ever to watch. I want to see how the legends played and the iconic moments they had. THANKS :) 




 Teams should always be bigger than the players in any sport. There are usually BIG problems that arise when players think they are bigger than the team. 




 Well so much for being coy. I reciprocate the feelings, what can I say. 




 Put your ear down to the earth and listen for it. Put your heart into it, and ye shall find what your heart desires! 




 you're right, as much as it pains me, gotta take it down. 




 Stop thinking of it as a losing streak. Each game is independent of one another. So try to just put past losses behind you and focus on the next game, to avoid going on tilt

 




 No one pays them. It's a video game. 




 Anyone else think that it would be nicer if they played the replays a bit slower so the pros have enough time to speak about the fight. A lot of time the fights are too fast paced and some of the strategy and analysis is left out. Especially in crucial fights when there are so any moving parts, it'd be nice to absorb as much info as possible. 




 Somebody is on Fantasy tilt 




 Looking at the champs compared to the actor. Christian Bale seems the most believable. 




 Ahh okay, I would think of a champ with no cc. Multiple abilities that can cc usually help define a support champ as well as their ability to shield or heal you. Master yi offers no cc and will steal your cs without protecting you. An adc also come to mind that doesn't really support but helps kill, is Lucian. Zed also doesn't seem to offer too much into the role. And I'm not sure about Vlad or not. 




 You mean the most viable, nonpopular pick? Or do you literally want the worst champion that could ever try and support? 




 I think it's the fact that no team is really head and shoulder above the other teams. So confidence in ending games is an issue. It took TSM so long to close out that game. 




 Xpecial and Cop on the analysts desk, stick knives in my ears plsssss 




 Cosplay still sucks. 




 Who's this guy at the announcer's desk???? WTF 




 Why did he make out with Meachum? Can anyone explain that scene? 




 Actually really helpful and concise. I've been wanting to learn Elise as well, but was kind of discouraged by her two forms. I don't like champs with 2 forms because I have a tough time judging each forms power. Thanks. 




 So basically this post is about how EU LCS makes me really hard, but ends up being anti-climactic. Reflects my last 3 days fairly accurately. 




 Not sure if a parody or not. 0(o.o)0 




 If reddit didn't have a "remember me" system when logging into the site, you'd be screwed. 




 really? :( first time I've seen it. It's original to me. Uh-oh philosophical debate incoming.  




 CLASSIC MIX-UP 




 I'm confused. Explain pls. 




 Hmmmm Interesting. 

Pros: Rewards team for defending wards ( as you stated)  

Cons:Would make the pink slightly stronger (not sure if a noticeable difference) [Not sure if this is even a con]

Hmm. It's actually a pretty fresh and original idea. Good Work. Wouldn't mind seeing it implemented. Not sure if it will, but I like it nonetheless. 




 Dodging is the last good defense against trolls, I say lower the LP penalty, even though i'll never reach that division. I approve of the ideology behind it. 




 Can you make a tutorial video pls? I think the community would be grateful. 12/10 on improvements, would buy it from a 3am infomercial on comedy central
