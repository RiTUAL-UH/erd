 Cute overload. 




 I love that you call him "The Chew".  My friends dog looks nothing like Chewbacca, but can make the Chewbacca noise on command.  It. Is. AWESOME. 




 He is beautiful!  And his face looks so wise. :) 




 I do wish that I had seen this about 3 month ago.  I really wanted to live in that direction.  Alas, too late! 




 Cool!  And I also hope that there are some LA firms there.  I'll try to check it out if I can get over there after word, and will spread the word among the grad students! 




 Hey lady_elayne!  Nice to know I'm not alone!  You should PM me and tell me ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL about your Saddlebreds!  I'm a Morgan girl myself, but I've ridden and shown my share of Saddlebreds and Hackneys as well. 




 Thank you!  And no, you didn't sound too "judge-y". :)  




 Sorry to confuse, captainstag!  And you're right, just like anything (even riding in general) it can be done well and to the advantage of the horse, or poorly to the ultimate disadvantage of the horse. 




 Ah I see.  Since I'm a Morgan person, I'm more on the "fewer aids" side of the camp too.  And yes, the clump of dirt!  Always a big hit with my horse too.  But ohhhhh the dreaded baby powder bottle...all you have to do is pick it up!  He clearly thinks it's going to eat him. XD 




 Oh man, my horse LOVES the fire extinguisher -- he thinks it's hilarious. :)

And to answer your question, I show Morgans.

What do you mean when you say that Arabs are one of the more natural breeds?  Do you mean for saddleseat?  Because my view was always that the Arabs were the most unnatural saddleseat horses, simply because their motion (historically) was to move with lower action and a sweeping stride to cross desert sands efficiently, not to step high and raise the knees.  I know that they are now breeding for the bend at the knee, but I don't know how true it is to the breed's origins.  Your opinions? 




 I'd love to know what you do to your soil to get those nice onions!  We have onions, but they are always small and never get to be the nice, large onions we would like.  Doesn't matter which variety we try, they are always puny. 




 Well, the equitation is completely different - so comparing a saddleseat rider to a hunter/jumper rider is like comparing apples and oranges.  To effectively ride our horses we need to sit back, legs away from our horse's sides, hands elevated.  Saddleseat equitation should look like this: http://www.discoverhorses.com/saddle-seat-equitation.html  Of course, there are people out there that ride like this (ick):http://www.uphaonline.com/images/charming.jpg

If course, the same goes for any discipline. I founded and formed an equestrian team at my college and was the only non-jumper person.  I was SHOCKED at the lack of ability in most of the riders.  So many of them were pushed to jump before they really had developed a seat.  I think this is why jumping is seen as "dangerous", simply because people haven't really learned how to "sit" yet.

And yes, I've done LOTs of cross-training.  My mare transitioned to huntseat years ago, so for the past several years I've been riding both Saddleseat and Huntseat, and I've had to develop two different forms of equitation depending on which horse I'm riding.  I've also done hunter/jumper stuff in college, some dressage, and LOTS of driving.  I think everyone should take a "vacation" from their discipline and try something else for a few months!  It's so helpful.  

You can judge my equitation for yourself if you like, I'm by no means an "equitation rider" and was never trained as one, but this is how I sit when I ride huntseat.  http://i.imgur.com/jFVcm.jpg 




 I can't follow you captainstag.  What about horses that wear Easyboots?  Do you think that horses shouldn't wear shoes at all?  Show horses' longer feet and weighted shoes cause no ill effects.  Many show horses compete into their 20's and are completely sound.  I wish I had a picture of my horse's feet -- they're really not that much longer than your average horse.

I do think that the TWHs stress out their horse's joints in the "big lick" division.  Those shoes are huge, heavy, and throw the entire stance of the horse off.  AND they ride two year olds that way!  Those horses are too often crippled before they hit 10.  So sad. 




 No, he only wears it in the summer, and that's only on days leading up to a show.  Also, it's it really hot we just leave it off.   




 Hey FlameGirl!  I'll go through these one by one:

1) You can do some things to encourage head and neck position, but most of all the horse has to be built for it.  My horse is not, that is is why he because a hunter and not a saddleseat-type horse.  However, assuming the horse is upheaded to begin with, the upheadedness and head carriage come from a) building muscle and b) collection.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Dumb jockeys are used, taking the place of a rider when a horse isn't being ridden.  They help teach a horse the proper "frame" to be in.  When we ride, our hands are elevated to meet the elevation of our horse's head and neck.  While riding, you can bump and tickle your snaffle bit to ask the horse to keep his head up.  Of course, none of this is possible without good impulsion from the hind end.  When a horse pushes off its hind end, it elevates its front end.  There are plenty of horse that go around the ring with their head down because they are not collected and pushing off the hind!  

2) I don't know much about rollkur.  I've never seen it used outside of dressage. :/

3) The rider sitting farther back on the horse does not have any ill effects on the horse's back.  Morgans, Saddlebreds, etc. have a center of gravity that is in the middle of their back (they are built in an upright fashion) as opposed to a thoroughbred or quarter horse whose center of gravity is over the shoulders.  The saddles are designed to sit in the middle of the horse's back and the flaps are cut back to free up the horse's shoulders and not impede their movement.

4) Whips are used pretty much like they are in any other discipline I suppose.  Lots of riders show without whips.  I rarely use them, even at home when training.  Sometimes they are carried as a "prop", especially in equitation classes, and I carry one in the ring sometimes because my horse tends to focus and listen better if I'm holding it.  Otherwise, it's just an aid, as it is with anything else.

5)  Many Saddlebreds and Hackneys have had their tail "set".  In other words, a muscle in the underside of the tail has been cut to allow the tail to stretch up and bend over at the top.  Some people think that the tail bone is broken, which is not the case (and would be awful!).  My horse is a Morgan, so this type of procedure is illegal for our breed.  He does, however, wear a bustle in his stall to encourage an "arched" tail carriage.  Desired Morgan tail carriage looks like this: http://www.playmorfarm.com/Play_mor_farms_stallions/stallion_images/centerpiece-thumb-2010-2.jpg  Desired Saddlebred tail carriage looks like this: http://www.goinggaited.com/Born_Contender_al_12-4-06.jpg

Feel free to ask follow up questions! 




 The topics that always come up with "abuse" in the saddleseat world generally has to do with several things: shoeing, soring, and training aids.

1) Saddleseat horses wear weighted shoes, and their hooves are grown out longer than, say, a thoroughbred's hooves.  Many people see this as strange because their horses don't have feet like this, and thing that a) the shoes are heavy and hurt the horse and that b) the hooves lose the proper angle when they are grown out and it is detrimental to the horse's legs.  The shoes are, in actuality, quite light.  We have to realize that we're dealing with a 1000 lb animal, and the shoes weigh a matter of ounces.  Also, when the hooves are grown out longer, proper angles HAVE to be maintained for the horse to be sound and happy, so it's actually very important to keep the angles correct.  Of course there are crappy farriers out there, but that can happen to any horse of any breed/discipline.  It is also important to point out that hoof length and shoe length are strictly regulated -- every time I leave the ring after a class there is a steward there measuring my horse's hooves, making sure we are within the regulations. 

2) People often think that Saddlebreds, Morgans, National Show Horses, etc. are "sored" in the fashion that some Tennessee Walking Horses are.  In the TWH world, some trainers (not all) apply chemicals to the legs of the horses that burn or cause pain, causing the horse to lift its legs high to try and get away from the sensation.  It's abusive, but it does work, and the reason it works for TWHs is that they are gaited (meaning they perform a running walk) and do not perform a trot.  A sored horse will look lame at the trot (because they are).  Therefore, soring for trotting breeds is irrational.  Even a Saddlebred that can perform the two extra "gaited horse" gaits (the slow-gait and rack) still have to trot in the show ring, and a sored horse would stick out like, well, a sore thumb.  I do not condone what is done to the Walking Horses, and will never be about to understand how the owners and riders of these horses can put their horses through this and still say they love them.  

3) Training aids used in the saddleseat world are things like stretchies and chains.  Stretchies are simply a length of rubber surgical tubing that is connected between the horses front legs to provide resistance.  They look like this: http://i.imgur.com/vpc0W.jpg.  Have you done this at the gym? http://www.health.com/health/static/hw/media/medical/hw/h9991377_001_02.jpg  It works the same way, building up the chest and shoulder muscles of the horse -- this can create a higher step through improving muscle tone.  Some horses, like my horse, don't use them -- they take short steps to avoid them, basically looking at me and saying "yeah...whatever". :)  As for chains, they are places like bracelets around the horse's ankles, and again, encourage a higher step.  The combination of a bit of weight (think ankle weights) plus the looseness of the chain (the chain flings forward when the horse trots, and carries the foot a bit with it, creating a higher, more open step).  Here is a picture of a horse trotting wearing chains.  You can see how the chain is flinging forward on her hind leg http://morganshowcase.com/Listing.php?HorseName=Wonderful%20Tonight Page=Photo Order=4.  Some folks think that these chains are exceptionally heavy, but really, they're just chains.  Perhaps like one you'd lock up your bike with.  Kids put them on their feet at horse shows and pretend to be "show horses" all the time.  There is also the misconception that the chains bang onto the horses feet causing as "soring" effect.  Again, soring a trotting horse doesn't work, and moreover this is not an effect of using chains.  Some chains come coated, padded, or are wrapped to prevent any sort of injury from occurring, and many horses get worked with their legs wrapped and boots on.  An added bonus of riding a horse wearing chains is that they jingle, and it's a good exercise for riders to listen to the rhythm of the chains to determine their horse's stride, cadence, and speed.

Wowzers, that got long!  Thanks for your questions CaptainCorpsie! 




 Hello fellow Reddit equestrians!  I have been constantly seeing forum after forum of people blogging, posting, and ranting about "show horse abuse" in all disciplines, and one that always arises are the Saddleseat horses.  I read the comments, I look at the examples, and generally people who make negative comments are doing so because they're not sure what the discipline is all about, and don't understand the training, riding, and showing of these horses.  

Also, many people don't know what Saddleseat is at all, which is understandable since it's sort of a small world compared to the western and hunter circuits.

So here I am, a saddleseat rider putting myself out there.  AMA!!! 




 You're welcome! 




 Well, marathons ARE very impressive! :D  So yes, maybe you do have HMS, but isn't it great that someone could basically throw you off a building?  I have video of me getting thrown very hard off of a horse and when I hit the ground, I bounce. 




 aaaaaaaaaand that looks like me. 




 I was, and still am, that girl. 




 Some people with HMS can certainly still run, it's just not one of the things I'm able to do.  I wouldn't rush into the doctor, but next time you go in for a check up you might want to mention it.  They may look at you right there, or if you like, you could have them refer you to a rhumatologist (that's who diagnosed me).  

The back pain may be unrelated, as many people have back pain, but the sprains and dislocations could be a sign of HMS.  Have you ever broken a bone?  I tend to sprain/dislocate in situations where other people may break (falling off horses, having a horse fall on top of me, etc.).  I wonder if you are the same.

Also, it's AWESOME that you compete in marathons -- something I would love to be able to do! 




 Fortunately, I do not have the life-shortening form of Ehlers.  The rarer forms are quite debilitating and deadly.  And yes, I have very soft and stretchy skin.  I have a huge wenis! http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wenis 




 I can and I do!  I can't do some things -- like if I do pushups I basically dislocate my shoulders, but I do squats, flys, presses, etc.  It actually helps to do some strength training because it builds up muscle around the joints which helps them stabilize. 




 I'm worried about having kids for this very reason, and also because I'm afraid I'll pass on the HMS to my children.  I score a 7, so we're pretty close in the regard.  What exactly happened when you were pregnant? 




 I can't tell you what the difference is, and there is a recent study that shows they aren't different at all.  There are several types of Ehlers Danlos, and hypermobility is one of the types.  I do have the elastic skin, and I break blood vessels and veins all the time.  I bruise like a ripe peach too, so I never know what exactly to call what I have.  I just stick with calling it "hypermobility".   




 Oh yes, it is ALL about the impact.  The elliptical machine at the gym and I are BFFs. 




 The best way to be!  Now go freak out all of your friends!!! 




 I have been diagnosed by a doctor.  I was diagnosed when I was about 13 or 14. 




 Those are definitely the two camps that people split into!  Typically, people who are into medicine are in the "ooooOOOOOoooo" camp and most other people are in the "OH GOD MAKE IT STOP" camp.  My boyfriend is used to it, but I think it still freaks him out on occasion -- especially the hands.

I don't demonstrate very often, and I do think there is something to be said for the theory that demonstrating makes things go bad faster.  You keep stretching and stretching every time you do it, so at the very least, you're not making things any better.  But yeah, I do it in my sleep, and there are also things I do that I figured were normal, and apparently aren't.  I scared the crap out of a yoga instructor once. :)

As for the running vs. biking, for me it's definitely not an issue of fitness.  I work out and my recovery time is amazing, but once I start to run, all kinds of shit starts to go down.  Basically, when I run and my body is subjected to the impact of the running motion, my legs can't hold themselves together.  So then my muscles try to compensate for the loose joints and overtax *themselves* and then my heart begins to work overtime trying to get blood and oxygen to the muscles.  My doctor told me to not take up regular running, as it may overtax my heart.  




 One other idea is to go the the Red Stag Supperclub on Tuesdays, which is their "Cheap Date Night".  Two entrees, a bottle of wine, and two desserts for $32, and the atmosphere is wonderful.  A nicer place where you could dress up a bit and make an occasion out of it.  Call ahead for reservations though, the deal is very popular! 




 I went into the doctor thinking I had juvenile arthritis.  When she found no sign of that, she started putting me through flexibility tests and basically tied me into a knot on her exam table.  She got it right on the nose that it was HMS, but other doctors thought it was just "growing pains" even though I hadn't grown in years, or didn't have an explanation.  Not many docs I've meant know about it, and so I educate every medical student I run into about HMS!  I sat next to one on the plane and we started talking about it -- he had just studied it in class and was fascinated that he was sitting next to a living embodiment of his textbook!   




 I found out about the name ON REDDIT!  Hooray for Reddit!  And yes, you are not alone. :D 




 Thanks for pointing out that this is serious, dizzysparrow.  While it is entertaining, there is quite a bit of pain associated with it.  I partially dislocate things all the time -- they often pop back in on their own shortly after, but that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.   I've also sprained my left ankle 18 times, usually just by walking down the sidewalk, and my right 13 times.  This to me is "normal".  

As for how it effects my daily life, it depends.  I cannot hold a pen for very long, so I take all notes on my laptop when I'm in classes.  Winter is the hardest -- my hands and legs stiffen up and I have problems holding onto things and moving my fingers.  I was in a drawing class this winter where I had to hold a pen for hours.  I would have to come home at night and use hot packs on my hands to ease the pain.  Of course there is the obvious -- I can't run, so fun co-ed sports are out (mostly) and I have to invest in a gym membership to stay fit since I can't just go running (though I do bike in the summer).  I believe that the worst thing about HMS is that people can't tell you have it, and therefore can't understand why you hurt or think you are "whiny".  If you looked at me walking down the street, I look no different than most people aside from a slight limp I sometimes have.  You cannot always see pain. 




 ZOMG BENDY ZOMBIES!!! 




 Interesting to know.  I read that myopia can be related, so I figure that it could be a lack of strength in the eye tissues causing it, but since they're not sure what causes visual snow, who knows? 




 I am really good at goofing-off wrestling!  Someone thinks they have me pinned and then BAM!, I'm bent in half backwards giving them an epic wedgie. 




 It may, or you may just be flexible.  Do you have the associated chronic pain?  Or are you just delightfully bendy? 




 My pain did not subside when I finished growing that I can remember, but my pain also got worse when I was 13 or 14.  I stopped growing when I was 11, so I hadn't even hit puberty yet.  I'm really not sure how your son will be effected, but my doctor believes that as my body naturally tightens up with age (the way normal people become "stiff" with old age), I will simply become more normal and the pain will subside.  

It's interesting to hear about your son's hamstrings.  Mine are also incredibly tight -- I can't even touch my toes despite being so flexible, but I've never had any physical therapy done to loosen them up, or heard of any positive reason to do so, but I sure hope it is helping your son.  As for things like sports, let your son play!  I'm not sure where you stand on this, but don' let his EDS hold him back.  I was a three sport athlete in high school (before I was told to stop running) and had no ill effects.  I am currently an internationally competing equestrian, and I can tell you that horseback riding is great exercise for EDS kids.  Balance, muscle tone, and cardio all without the impact of running.  It is something I can do with few problems.

Tell your son to hang in there and use ice/hot packs when the going gets tough.  If you have any other coping questions let me know! 




 Here are some photos for you all.  I can't take my two favorite poses because that would require another person (me bending in half backwards touching my toes to my forehead and me popping my shoulder blades out like a spiny dinosaur), but maybe I can get them later today.

Me bending my fingers backward (no this does not hurt) http://i.imgur.com/51PjQ.jpg

My fingers bending by themselves (without me pushing them back).  I can hold a tennis ball this way!  http://i.imgur.com/y5sc6.jpg

How I type.  Palms stay flat on the laptop, and only my fingers move: http://i.imgur.com/RLVPL.jpg

 From your description it sounds like she may, though I have no business diagnosing people.  Does she have chronic pain?  Aches in her joints and muscles?  It is possible to have hypermobility without the pain -- my mom has it as well (it is genetic) but can run and do things I can't do.  My 63-year old mom can outrun me!  

Of course, if she does gymnastics, yoga, pilates, or other "stretching" forms of exercise, it could simply be from that.  You can "become" a bit hypermobile through certain exercises. 




 Well, if you're referring to sexual positions (which I'm guessing you are), it IS rather beneficial.  You can basically put any part of my body anywhere you like.  

On a more serious note though, there can be complications with pregnancy, and this condition is genetic, so he and I both have some concerns about having kids, if we ever choose to.  I can't say I would want my future children to go what I've been through.    




 Huzzah!  Don't let the haters get you down, man. 




 Haha!  Now that I'm sitting here at my desk trying it out, I would say that yes, it is rather easy. 




 I like you too kaizerfloyd!   




 I have always been a bendy individual, but chronic pain in high school
sent me to the rheumatologist to figure out what was going on with my
body. Turns out I have hypermobility syndrome, sometimes called benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS) and, more recently, believed to be the same as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_joint_hypermobility_syndrome#Hypermobility_syndrome.

I also have visual snow (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow)
but I'm not sure if there is any correlation between the two, since
little research on visual snow has been done.

I sprain all the time, I type like a freak (according to my
boyfriend), I sleep in positions that look like I've been in a
horrible accident, and I can't run (my legs can't handle it), but I do
live an active and joyful life despite my rebellious body! AMA!

Edit: pictures have been taken and are linked below! 




 Well, he has a son...so too late!  Also, from what I have seen/heard, he is a FANTASTIC father.

 *hugs fellow Artie-loving Redditor* 




 Whoever made this, bless you for including Artie - The Strongest Man in the World. 




 Mine looks almost identical too, but probably larger from what I can see in the photo.  He is springer spaniel/golden retriever.  http://imgur.com/F8o6g  Maybe the postman's dog was a golden?   




 When I was a little kid I thought that the Colonel Sanders logo was a chicken nugget with a face and tie.  




 I second what amaltheas2 has said.  As another horse owner/rider/competitor of many years, stick to riding lessons, and lease a horse before you buy.  If you are going to eventually buy a horse for your children, make sure you have a professional trainer you know and trust try out the horse for you, and also have your kids try out the horse to make sure it is suitable for them and their riding abilities.  Also, even if your kids are small DO NOT buy them a pony.  Ponies are smart, quick, and sometimes rather mean.  Even though they seem more intimidating because they are larger, get an older horse for your children instead.  It may be a longer way to fall off, but they will most likely fall off much less often.  Be safe and good luck! 









 I've always thought royal blue looked great on lighter, redder bays, but I'm not sure what colors they have.  I'm sure she'll look great in any color! 




 1: Awesome coloring job.

2: You are some serious eye candy (assuming you're the guy in the photo).
