 yes? your point being? 




 merely asking for proof of god, nothing more. should be simple enough, no? 




 no, i have seen no proof of god, until such proof exists, there is no god. pretty simple. science is all based on proof. show me proof and i will believe. until then. there is no god. 




 and there's the actual bible that treats women like property.

 yes, and comics are proof that  mutants exist.  




 oh we dont, we're still waiting for people to prove that god exists. so far, nothing. 




 please see - ALL the Crusades

aaaaaaaaaaaaaand we're done  




 an entire body of medical professionals would disagree with you about both sexuality and gender. and given a choice between the two, i'll go with medicine. religion isnt logical in the slightest. the belief in people coming back from the dead, or walking on water would require too much of a suspension of common sense. the bible isnt meant to be literal, there are too many contradictions. and unless you're reading it in its original aramaic and greek, you're not really getting the true context 




 do you really want me to start listing out all the so called christians who have been caught doing something unchristian? i mean there's an entire 2000 year  history of JUST the catholic church. 




 you know what, if more people had your attitude, i'd be a really happy trans girl 




 misguided, maybe, but not inherently bad 




 it'll open in an incognito window 




 amen 




 you should see my inbox. yeeesh. it's always the fundies. YOU WILL BURN IN HELL FOR ALL ETERNITY, but i will pray for your eternal soul.

uhhhh.... ok, thanks? 




 i have, that's how i became an atheist 




 only pointing out the hypocrites who preach family values who are then caught doing something they shouldnt be doing, like all the priests diddling little alter boys beneath their robes. 

were there atheist pedophiles? i'm sure there were, but they didnt have organized religion to hide behind so that they could continue doing it. 




 the bible is a fairy tale, and the sooner more people see that, the better off we will all be. people created god in their own image, and people can kill him too.

you will not accept homosexuality because of the bible? a book that says the sun is fixed in the sky? and that the moon is a light source? 

i used to think the way you did, i grew up christian, and then i studied the bible and i saw the error of my ways and became an atheist.

When I was a child, I spoke and thought and reasoned as a child. But when I grew up, I put away childish things. - 1 Corinthians 13:11 




 religion = choice

my sexuality and/or gender = not choice

when you use religion to criticize my sexuality and/or gender, then you are choosing to do so. because you could just as easily choose not to. therefore, you are in the wrong. pretty dang simple. 




 you didnt just compare homosexuality to pedophilia and torturing people at the stake, did you? christianity is a lifestyle choice, my sexuality and gender arent. my life isnt a "theory", i live it every day. and i take offense to anyone who criticizes it because of something somebody passed down thru oral tradition from the Bronze Age. society has evolved way past the need for religion. the faster it dies, the better off all of us will be.  




 i'd love to see a few examples of atheist "family values" hypocrisy if you could post a few articles. i'd do the same with the hypocritical christians, but even if i limited myself to the scandals that came out this year, i'd run out of space pretty quick. 




 well, first off, i have to point out that if anyone is against homosexuality/ non male/female marriages, then they are a bigot, even if they couch their arguments with the cloak of religion. religion is a choice, my sexuality isnt. so people can choose NOT to be a bigot, because there are plenty of christians who accept homosexuality for what it is, part of every day life. 




 http://imgur.com/DStRYfh 




 look at how many supposedly "good christian" people who preach their "good christian" values end up getting caught for doing something inappropriate which go against said "good christian" values.

and again, the only thing atheists argue for is that there arent any gods. that's pretty much it. everything else about how to live your life is completely up to you, good OR bad. 




 but atheists dont go around preaching family values explicitly laid down for them in a holy book. 




 it's pulled directly from the summary. 




 the title is pulled directly from the summary 




 jeez, it's like you become a pariah. i told a cousin that when i came out, i picked as an example of the kind of girl i wanted to be look wise (we have the same body type) and the first thing she says to me is "Look, i'm a REAL girl, ok? 100% female"

urgh.

i have to add that she's since become one of my biggest allies, because the REST of the fam fam hasnt come around yet. 




 actually, it was pulled from the summary 




 yes, and which is why we say that you can discuss YOUR OWN DOSE as well as to state that we ARENT doctors.

every single one of us knows somebody who self-meds. some do because they didnt want to spend one more day as a gender they werent. some of us just had no access to a doctor who would prescribe them hormones. 

we are NOT against self-medding. we just ask that people not give out advice as if there were only one dose for everybody. there isnt. i'm not on spiro, or progesterone, only estrogen shots. one of my girlfriends is on shots too, but she takes them every week as opposed to every two weeks like me. my other partner is on spiro, estrogen, and progesterone, and she might add avodart to her regimen.

the mods of /r/asktransgender care about the community, which is why we became mods in the first place.   




 yeah, they WERE rewritten as of Jan this year. i totes WAS going off the old rules. still stands tho. we're not doctors. we cant be going around giving out medical advice. we CAN discuss what OUR dosages are, and point out that there isnt a "standard" dose for everybody.

 




 no one standard dose, i should have said. i stand corrected. i was just trying to make the point that you cant just go around telling people that they should just take a certain dose of certain types of pills  




 i'm 42, came out when i was 39, and yes, i feel like i'm still in my teens/20's. totes should have come out earlier. but i cant go back and change the past, i dunno if i would, i like the way my life turned out, i've had a blast and i continue to have fun.

i guess it's all in how you perceive it.  




 i'm not a doctor, there is no such thing as a "standard dose" which part about those two things dont make sense? not everyone reacts to hormones in the same way, which is why we should ALWAYS see a doctor first.

yes, not all of us have access to a doctor. which is why we allow discussions about dosing AS LONG AS WE DONT SUGGEST THAT IT IS WHAT EVERYONE SHOULD DO.

i have two other trans girls living with me, and we are ALL on different prescriptions. it is the height of arrogance to assume that you know what the other person's correct dosage should be.



 




 and we choose to abide by those rules. we arent doctors. and even if we were, the people asking for advice to DIY arent our patients. and even if they were, we STILL couldnt prescribe them meds because we'd have to do a full check up first.

yes, there are those of us who DIY, but it should be the absolute last resort.

i'm sorry you seem to disagree, but we have a responsibility as mods to the trans community and to the reddit community as a whole to abide by the rules the admins have set down. 




 we've tried to keep everybody informed with the changes we've made AND we've asked for suggestions. so to say we've got "secret rules" is simply not true.

 the footy is something else entirely, because i think that any club other than liverpool is sub-standard, but i do enjoy the rangers celtic matches to no end. 




 i know you feel alone, when i came out, i thought i'd have to do this all by my lonesome, and my friends not only supported me, but they wanted to come along for the ride. i have never cried as much as i did the day i came out to my friends and one by one they almost all gave me their unconditional support. by the time i was done telling all my friends, i was a blubbering pile of jello.

you're not alone, you never will be.

your answer means that you'd be happier as a girl, which means the answer to your question of whether or not to transition is "YES"

if you are trans, then the only option for us IS to transition. who can only find true happiness if we are in turn true to ourselves. living a lie will never achieve that. 




 i grew up methodist, spent ten summers at bible camp, i know religious stupid. my dad doesnt believe that trans is a thing. out of my entire family, i have two cousins who support me.... and that's it. if you have a religious fam fam like i did, you are shit of out luck. my dad tells me all the time that he'll pray for me. 

my friends are my family now, although i'm not giving up hope that my fam fam will come around.

but you transition or not because you're trans, or not. not because of anyone else but you. 

if you had that magic button to press, and you could wake up tomorrow in the other gender and no one would be the wiser, would you do it or not? therein lies your answer. 




 hang on, dont chew my head off, i was merely trying to lighten the mood. but honestly, it really is a decision only you can make. nobody here lives in your head or knows the situation better than you do, so it really does have to be up to you.

if you already are seeing a therapist, that's great, please continue to do so and i hope they they can help you ultimately make the decision.  




 lol, you looking for permission?? with the power bestowed upon me by the poodles before me, i hereby grant thee permission to transition!

ta daaaaaaaaaaaa!

but seriously, have you had a talk with a gender therapist? because that's something only you can really answer for yourself.

as far as how you look... you're preeeeeeeeetty andro right now, 




 there's no one way to be genderfluid, if you sub to /r/genderqueer (i mod over there too), you'll find lots of people who experience gender in MANY different ways and who present in many more variants than you think possible.

i know plenty of people who shift abruptly, somtimes from one extreme to another, i.e. super femme to super butch.

i cant speak to your other issues, but your gender issues are NOT out of the ordinary.

come over and chat, post the same question you did here, you'll find plenty of people replying 




 lucky for me that i went to college, so i know better than what they teach in high school 




 like i said, i'd agree with your opinion, but then we would both be wrong 




 well, i'd agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong 




 except that it was supposed to be an "adrenaline shot to the arm"  




 you're welcome! altho i'm more of an F1 kinda girl.

 yes, which is why it is flaired with the "Social Science" tag 




 every religious figure you can mention was a flawed human being.

Martin Luther  King was a serial adulterer, the FBIs monitoring of King  make up much of what we now know about the mans personal life. King had engaged in so many extramarital affairs that his wife, Coretta Scott King, had reportedly become disillusioned with their marriage.

Kings right-hand man, Ralph Abernathy, wrote in his 1989 autobiography that the staff all understood and believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside marriage. It was just that he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation.

Billy Graham? Homophobic bigot. He considered homosexual behavior to be a "sinister form of perversion," a lifestyle choice that will lead gays to personal ruin. When a young woman wrote him about her sexual love for another woman in 1974, the evangelist replied with a threat: homosexual perverts will not inherit the kingdom of heaven. "Your affection for another of your own sex is misdirected and will be judged by God's holy standards," he answered.

Mahatma Gandhi? He had unusual personal practices (which included, alongside his famed chastity, sleeping naked next to nubile, naked women to test his restraint.) The pre-independence prime minister of the Indian state of Travancore called him, "a most dangerous, semi-repressed sex maniac"

 




 more like BANG! "i was forced to shoot him because he was wielding something in his hand in a threatening manner and i feared for my life." 




 with raw story, none, however, the study that it is linked to is.

 that's a really good question. i only knew i had switched over when i got gendered female over the phone while talking to a bank rep. first i cracked the biggest smile ever, but then i stopped and asked myself when the heck i switched over, because the only thing i consciously did was to stop resonating. the pitch i must have unconsciously raised over time.  




 i dont think anybody here is under any illusions that bernie will win the nomination. what he's doing is shifting the conversation and the attitudes of the democrats to the left, where they should be. if the tea party shows us where the hard right is, then bernie shows us where the hard left is.

 i've known people who decide not to transition after psychotherapy. i've known one trans person who detransitioned after ten years. i've known somebody who detransitioned, only to re-transition after two years. transition is pretty personal, and everybody's journey is unique.

The Mod Poodle 




 Warren 2016 




 before i came out, i crossdressed pretty much only to fap too. i was turned on by wearing all the sexy lingerie. then i decided to go out en femme one halloween, i found the frilliest outfit to wear, and i was TERRIFIED of going out like that because i was scared i was going to have a raging boner the whole time thru. once i walked thru that door(took me about half an hour to work up the courage), i was just HAPPY to be dressed as a girl. i loved the feeling of the air swishing past my thighs. 

and once i started hrt, even the morning wood went away. i still love dressing up in sexy lingerie, but only because it makes me feel super sexy. i blame testosterone poisoning, "here, let me take a simple situation AND SEXUALIZE IT TO THE MAX"

seriously, if you're a girl, fuck testoerone. (for the guys, carry on) 




 i know you can use quotes in video submissions, i gotta ask the mods if i can do that in articles without the headline if it's misleading. that's a really good point, thank you 




 yes, earlier 




 it has a link to the actual study 




 good point, thank you for your reply. 




 not in the comments 




 exactly 




 look, 90% marginal rate will never happen, knowing bernie tho, he really means it. also knowing bernie, should he become president, he would also compromise so that he'd settle for a marginal tax around 40%

better to ask for the moon than to start somewhere around 50%. 




 something something party of good christian family values 




 yeah, but rules say i cant change the title 




 cant change the title, remember? 




 no fucking choice, it's the fucking rules 




 this is /r/politics, i gotta go with the actual title of the article 




 But in the rush  to publish everything, how do you guard against fraud? i ask because of the recent controversy over the raw data in the study that showed that gay canvassers swayed voters opinions in a lasting way.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/26/science/maligned-study-on-gay-marriage-is-shaking-trust.html?partner=socialflow smid=tw-nytimes _r=1

*edit: another article about false and retracted studies

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/23/opinion/whats-behind-big-science-frauds.html 




 a guardian article that referenced the study AND quoted the researchers that collated almost every twin study across the world from the past 50 years.

so yeah, it's a valid news article. 




 josh needs to go for treatment, his parents need to be taken to task, the girls he molested need help too.  




 josh duggar is not a pedophile, he's a sexual abuser. big difference. and his parents are the most at fault here because they covered it up, didnt get him the help he needed, and blamed the girls because of their fucked up version of christianity that they subscribe to. 




 see Bobby Jindal 




 yes 




 missed it by THAT  much 




 they've tried to change the mind to fit the body, and they've shown that it just doesnt work. so that's why the recommended course of treatment for people diagnosed with gender dysphoria is to transition.

http://www.bbc.com/news/health-11814300

so just like how homosexuality was deemed to be not a harmful disorder, so too with being transgender. it is far easier to change the body than to change the mind.   




 uhh, if the Duggars are liberal, i sure as heck dont want to see what they consider a true conservative 




 they can keep on keeping on, their numbers will keep on shrinking right along with that attitude. 




 the Schadenfreude is overwhelming 




 some are, what this brings up is the whole "Nature" vs "Nurture" argument 

http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/19/are-we-products-of-nature-or-nuture-science-answers-age-old-question

science says that it's 50/50 




 cuz it's yours, silly. 




 as a fellow gay transwoman, i have only been able to achieve penetration with help from viagra. the dysphoria down there is just too dang high. has been since the beginning.

on a side note:- arent girl orgasms WAY better than boy orgasms? like holyshitballs batman. 




 right? 




 hey, i've removed your comment because of the "fucking exclusive dude club" bit. we try to be inclusive here, and that also means NOT picking on the people who DO identify with the binary.

if you'd like to repost the comment with something less judgemental like "no, i didnt want into the dude club," it'd be better. 




 *sigh*

i'm sorry, i'm a li'l jumpy, i spent too long replying to the anti-abortionists in this thread. a woman should have a choice, dammit, i just wish people could see that. i'm pro-life, i think we ALL are, i just believe that abortion should be the last resort, but i DO believe that the choice should ultimately belong to the woman whose child it is. 




 please see

"if you cannot force a person to have a blood transfusion even if it will save their life, if you cannot harvest viable organs from dead people unless they consented prior, then you cannot force women to NOT have an abortion. case closed." 




 tell me about it 




 for a kiss? yeeeesh 




 i'm still male on my singapore IC, female on my ID in the US 




 i came out as trans when i was 39, i know people who have come out as gay, genderqueer, lesbian, and all things inbetween on the spectra  of gender and sexuality at all ages.

it is NEVER too late 




 the fetus cannot survive outside of the mother's body until the third trimester, until then she has every right to abort the fetus is she so chooses.

again, it's pretty simple.  




 ok, let's take this from the top, shall we?

the jews werent growing inside the germans' bodies. babies are. if you cannot force a person to have a blood transfusion even if it will save their life, if you cannot harvest viable organs from dead people unless they consented prior, then you cannot force women to NOT have an abortion. case closed.

come back with a different analogy, one that doesnt involve nazis. 




 *sigh* again with the concentration camp analogies. just stop already. whatever women want to do with their bodies is really up to them.  




 yeeeeeeeeeeeup 




 first and second trimester, the fetus is dependant on the mother's body to survive, therefore any and all medical decisions, including whether or not to abort lies solely with the mother. end of story. you may not agree with it, but if we cannot force someone to get a blood transfusion to save their life, and we cannot harvest viable organs from their body after they die, then we cannot force a person not to have an abortion. it's really that simple. 




 we're all pro-life, some of us just believe that sometimes abortion becomes ncessary 




 we're talking about the first and second trimester 




 no, it supports pro choice. because at the end of the day, if the fetus is still in its first or second trimester, than the choice lies with the mother. 




 http://www.lifenews.com/2013/11/07/pro-choice-blogger-promotes-10-reasons-to-have-an-abortion/ 




 you're welcome 




 the fetus is dependent on the mother to survive until the third trimester, until then, the decision on what to do with the pregnancy lies solely with the mother.

suicide should be legal if the person is of sound mental health.

a woman chooses to have sex, not to have a baby. should a pregnancy arise because the woman had sex, then the choice of what to do with said pregnancy lies only with her up to the third trimester.

pretty simple actually. 




 in the third tri-mester, yes. which is why there are restrictions on late term abortions 




 the baby is dependant on the mother for life, therefore, any medical decisions rests soley with her.  




 we shouldnt be blaming immigrants for contributing to the drought 




 and they still use a majority of the water. whatever they put back will still be less than what was taken out, so the water level in the reservoirs drop to the point where we're in the current crisis. it's unsustainable.  




 but that person doesnt have to be the mother, it cant be someone else. so if the mother decides she doesnt want to take care of the baby, she can give it up for adoption. 




 you cannot make medical decisions for another person, pretty simple actually, even if you vehemently disagree with those decisions.   




 an unborn child is dependent on the mother's body to survive, so all medical decisions rest with her. once the fetus becomes viable outside the mother's body is when abortion is restricted, which is why almost every country in the world has restrictions on third trimester abortions. 




 actually, no, because the medical descion of what can and cannot be done rests with the individual, in this case, the mother. you cannot force anyone to have or not have a medical procedure they do or do not want to have. so you cannot force a jehovah's witness to receive a blood transfusion even if it to save their life. you cannot remove viable organs from a recently deceased person, even if it is to save another person's life, because even dead bodies have certain rights. the right to have an abortion lies solely with the mother. end of story. 




 except that statewide, average water use is roughly 50% environmental, 40% agricultural, and only 10% urban. population has minimal impact on water use, it's the agriculture that's sucking cali dry 




 yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeup 




 *sigh* 




 um. wat. 




 uhhhh.....

how did he get elected again? 




 any medical decisions pertaining to the mother's body rest with her, unless she is incapacitated. if you cannot force a jehovah's witness to have something as simple as a blood transfusion to save their own life, then you cannot force a woman to NOT have an abortion. pretty simple. 

 




 abortion is a medical decision, which rests with the mother, who has final say. 




 he's that predictable? 




 but it still comes down to the fact that we cannot make ANY medical decisions for the woman, we cant make a jehovah's witness have a blood transfusion, even if it is to save her life.  




 ahhhh, the old "abortion clinics are like nazi concentration camps." well, let's see where that analogy breaks down, shall we? the jews werent growing inside another human being, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand we're done.  




 because that unborn human is growing inside of another human being with rights over her body, whom we cannot force to do anything she doesnt want to do. 




 because you cant even force a jehovah's witness  to have a simple blood transfusion, even if it's to save their life. therefore, you cannot force a woman NOT to have an abortion. it's not your body. 




 making college free would enable more people to get an education who would normally never be able to get one 




 because the bottom line is that other people do not get to decide what a person does with his or her body. we cant even take viable organs from dead bodies, because even dead bodies have rights.  




 ;-) 




 it's not your body, you cannot decide for another person what to do with her body, it is as simple as that. 




 no, it should be up to the woman to decide 




 because heaven forbid that we hear from the ones who didnt die 




 1) Staff Sergeant Eric Fidelis Alva EARNED a Purple Heart.

as for the height? have you scrolled thru /r/tall? you're one of the shorter girls there. i'm 5'11" and i rock 5 inch heels all the time. (size 9.5 shoe)

who knew that tall girls have big feet? /s

took me a year before i finally saw a girl staring back at me in the mirror.

and listen, your mom can call you a jabberwocky for all that it matters, it doesnt make it true. you know you're a girl, nothing on this plane of existence or beyond can change that fact.

that's the pesky thing about facts, they're true whether people choose to believe in them or not.

you're a girl. simple as that. 




 something something, separation of church and state 




 y'all do guilt at expert level. like i'm asian, and i get the whole "we're very disappointed in you" speech from my mom and dad, but my ex got the third degree, like her dad would keep telling her how they spent all the money to make sure she was raised right, went to church, bought all the clothes for her,cooked, cleaned up after her. 

like i said, at the end of it i was gonna volunteer as tribute. jeez. 




 i dont envy you the guilt trip your parents are gonna lay down on you. i would feel SO bad when my ex got into it with her parents. like it would get so bad that sometimes i felt that  I  should detransition for them. Korean guilt, on par with jewish mom level.  




 pffffffffffffft, no worries there, i'd run out of fingers and toes on five people before i ran out of friends in the bay area. shoot me a PM when you're here and i'll get the info on a few therapists and endos for you. 




 which city are you going to for your studies? if it's a big one, i prolly have friends there and i can get the info of the therapists in that area that they see. 




 because an education is never wasted. because all the people who graduated from college should give back so that others can have the same opportunity they did 




 ha, if you're  coming to the states, get all the documentation you need from therapists here. the hormones will be covered under your school's health insurance. 

and as far as me ex, we broke up before she heard back from the military, so i cant help you there. i'll text her and ask for you.

 well, have you been diagnosed with gender dysphoria? and are you out to your parents? my Korean ex-girlfriend was in the same boat as you are, but she came to the US on a student visa and transitioned here, so she has an official diagnosis and a letter she sent back asking for an exemption.

 well, having served in the army, i can tell you that in some ways, it's actually easier, because every minute of every day is planned for you, and when you DO have down time, you're so exhausted, you usually sleep.

also, if your service is mandatory like israel, singapore, taiwan, south korea etc, there's usually an exemption for trans people.

do you want to talk about it? i could prolly find the regulation on service exemption if you tell me what country you're from

 




 the article directly quotes Hasselback, American Family Association, and Penny Nance, all saying terrible things about trans people, as well as anti trans bathroom bills in states like Florida and Nevada brought up by republican legislators. 

the science is settled, the repuvblicans are the ones making it a political issue. 




 so you're saying that those republicans didnt say the things they are on record saying about trans people? 




 i was 7, so i dont remember thinking about gender at all. but then i saw a documentary about a bunch of trans girl prostitutes working to save up for reassignment surgery. after that, i pretty much thought about it pretty much non-stop til i came out..... 33 years later. :-p 




 there's a reason i havent gone back in twenty years 




 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand now i'm crying all over again. 




 And the founder of a chain of Christian treatment center Josh was sent to, resigned in 2014 under a cloud of accusations that he had sexually groomed and harassed young women and teens in his ministry.

the only thing missing from this circus is a clown car..... oh wait 




 something something hypocrisy of "family values" 




 hmmm, you raise a good point there. i didnt even think about it in that way. 




 as a queer trans girl lesbian, it makes me happy to read the comments of lgbt support in this thread 




 From the WPATH Standards of Care

A mental health screening and/or assessment is needed for referral to hormonal
and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria. In contrast, psychotherapyalthough highly
recommendedis not a requirement. 

The SOC do not recommend a minimum number of psychotherapy sessions prior to hormone
therapy or surgery. The reasons for this are multifaceted (Lev, 2009). First, a minimum number of
sessions tends to be construed as a hurdle, which discourages the genuine opportunity for personal
growth. Second, mental health professionals can offer important support to clients throughout
all phases of exploration of gender identity, gender expression, and possible transitionnot just
prior to any possible medical interventions. Third, clients and their psychotherapists differ in their
abilities to attain similar goals in a specified time period.

And RLE is only require for GCS,  not HRT

From the WPATH SoC:

The current Board of Directors of the WPATH herewith expresses its conviction that sex (gender) reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures. Genital reconstruction is not required for social gender recognition, and such surgery should not be a prerequisite for document or record changes; the Real Life Experience component of the transition process is crucial to psychological adjustment, and is usually completed prior to any genital reconstruction, when appropriate for the patient, according to the WPATH Standards of Care. Changes to documentation are important aids to social functioning, and are a necessary component of the pre-surgical process; delay of document changes may have a deleterious impact on a patient's social integration and personal safety.
 




 people engage in different ways, but there has to be a spark somewhere. take this sub, for instance, i'm sure there are many more lay people with only a cursory understanding of science that get so much more knowledge simply from reading the studies posted here and asking questions because they dont understand an aspect of the study and have someone more knowledgeable answer the question in a way that give the questioner a deeper understanding of the  topic of discussion. 




 well, they said in the article that the most likely application was for electric car batteries and home storage batteries. 




 but if you present it in a fun way that actually encourages understanding and prompts follow up questions and a desire to further one's knowledge, then we all win.

i've seen studies done on beer, and pot, and laughter, and poker. science CAN be fun too.

 Ezekiel 16:49 "Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy." 




 to be fair, they DID say that these were EARLY results, and even mentioned the potential weakness of the battery with the lithium anode in terms of long-term stability and safety 




 i have never seen so many messages in my inbox. lots of them were from my friends with nothing but support. had a few from bible thumping friends i had when i was going to an all boys christian school and ten years of summer bible camp. those werent too fun, mostly cuz they were along the lines of "god doesnt make mistakes" and "i'll pray for you to see the light" or some other ineffectual bullshit. 

family was the hardest, my parents didnt take it too well, nor my religious aunt and cousin. i have a really big fam fam, and only two of my cousins talk to me right now. 

my friends are my family now. i honestly thought i'd have to go thru transition by myself, and my friends made me cry because not only did they support me, but they wanted to come along for the ride. and that made me smile inside, even tho i was bawling my eyes out like a baby.

it's been a blast, and i dont regret it one bit.
