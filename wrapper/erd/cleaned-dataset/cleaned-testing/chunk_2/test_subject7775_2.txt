 There is plenty of people who would give people one on one support like AceCool. 




 A lot of people in Australia would be on Free TV, that is where you can find this Television channel I am talking about. If you go to One (Name of the channel) if you go up one (to SBS radio) then up again. You get to see a channel that has a moderate amount of static, there is no shows being broadcasted just a Windows Vista looking desktop, with russian words in all 4 corners. There is a program open, may be Task Manager due to it saying "Processes" in the program, but the reason it is strange to me, is that there is an error.

I am trying to make an insertion in a blackhawk, except when it lands, it only ejects me and not the rest of my squad.

 Really? Making people pay to learn Garry's Mod LUA? Why would anyone pay for this when people like cosmicseagull makes tutorials that are free on youtube. 




 Don't even try to hack. Use money printers in the server, put them underground and somewhere no one will hear it or see it. 




 What "stuff" are you stuck on? 




 Driving threw Cherno in a V3S isn't counted as "running" through the town. 




 First actual good use of that quote. 




 Game would probably still be broken by then, how about 3 years? 




 3 or 4 I am not really sure. 




 No GPS, 1/10 




 Bondage Fetish. 




 One quick question. Why are you wearing a school girl dress? 




 Go on a heli run around Green Mountain, that's where you will find an M4 or an AUG.
