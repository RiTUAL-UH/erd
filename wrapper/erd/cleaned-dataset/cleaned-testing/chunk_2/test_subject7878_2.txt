 I was a high school senior employed at a theater when that came out. I must have watched that movie 10-15 times in the theater. It was so NEW and mind-blowing at the time. 




 Star Wars Episode V: A New Hope

It was the father of modern-day sci-fi. 




 "Remote" or "Remote control". 




 Money.

I doubt their paid in pillow mints and tiny bottles of toiletries.  




 That made me laugh so hard the first time I saw him. No respect for him at all. Haha! 




 Up until recently, it's been Republican.

I've gone more Independent/Libertarian lately. 




 I don't know the baby on the right is smoking; baby on the left was not THAT funny at all. ;-) 




 Yep--same here. 




 Why the HELL did the parish allow some unprofessional moron do that?! It boggles my mind. 




 Super hi-res photo? 




 It all comes down to what people define "dance" as. To me, twerking isn't dancing; it's looking like a damn fool. 




 Bing: Translating Ebonics for your benefit. 




 Meh, I knew he'd have to die. I wouldn't consider his death a "happy" ending. More like a bitter-sweet ending.

I felt sorry for the guy in the beginning. Then he became an asshole. Then a complete dick. Then at the end, realized he was too far gone. I felt empathy for the poor bastard. Like I sort of did for Hitler after watching "Downfall". 




 Premium is worth it to me. I have it on all day during work, and all night as I sleep.  I love me some music. Haha! 




 Yep. The download tracks is awesome for when one has no wifi and a crappy data signal.

I never get ads though since I got premium. Weird... 




 Facebook is no longer required. 




 I'm a Spotify user myself.

I've used several in the past: iTunes, Rhapsody, Milk Music, etc... 




 Man, I frickin' love my GatorGrip. 




 So. Much. Plastic. Surgery. 




 Yeah--I'm hoping they are keeping a lot up their sleeves. 









 Is this more of that Common Core math? 




 He might have kicked them off in a fit of joy. 




 Seems like they just took Reddington's brain, and used it for Ultron.  LOL 




 Real interplanetary beings probably love all the decoys.  ;-) 




 Yes, that was my assumption as well (see video description). 




 I pretty much say that in the video description.  Also the reason why I put UFO in quotation marks.

It ***was*** unidentified... until I saw it moving. 














 The dress-wearing llama.  




 I agree. I hate games that practically require puchases.

"Flow" and "Flow Bridges" are fun to waste time with. 




 It's just simple politeness.  You're telling them to have a good night('s rest). 




 No. I was too busy working by that age.  




 From a bowl... with a spoon... 




 What is?  The fact that they serve Pepsi products instead of Coca-Cola? 









 Yeah--because THAT wasn't happening for the 30 minutes before I made this picture. 














 Go back to 4chan. 




 Go back to 4chan.

 Dur, that's because the average Anon is an underage moron who can't grow facial hair yet. 




 Go back to 4chan.

 Found this Conservative website with all of their "proof":

 [sarcasm]

How ***dare*** a privately-owned business be able to run it as they see fit!

[/sarcasm]

I don't agree with them doing so, but I don't think a government should FORCE them to do anything. Period. 




 For even MORE of a trip, set the playback speed to x2. 




 What would YOU do with the ability to freeze time? 



















 Obi-Faht Somewhere-Elsei... you're my only hope... damnit... 




 MY EARS!!!!!!!! 




 As a convert, I've often wondered if Jesus was telling us to pray that exact prayer, or just to say prayers LIKE that. The wording is sort of misleading.  




 "(sic)" by Slipknot. 




 It gets opened all the way, and used as a makeshift plate. 




 When did you know you fucked up with that unnecessary comma? 




 I was reading the daily readings today, and it reminded me of this difference. 




 It even SAYS that on the green/red/yellow band trailer screens. 




 [The one with sound added is ***SO*** much better.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXLelAXhgtA) 




 They had me at the drummer and guitarist in the beginning.  HAHA!

 "[Doing a topless shoot is] just against the way I was raised."

Apparently, getting a third boob was okay during her childhood then? 




 Great decision, Disney! 




 Yes, I'm a registered Republican, and they're been pissing me off lately.  So much so, that I'm seriously thinking about unregistering and voting more Libertarian. 









 Looks the same; just flipped. 




 She was so hot... what a waste.

[Just remember kids...](http://cdn.meme.am/instances/24368947.jpg) 









 Depends on the city. Bicycles in my city are dangerous. 




 Phantom Menace.

1. Bloated, unnecessary storyline.

2. Jar-Jar Binks.

3. Too much politics.

4. Midi-fucking-clorians.

5. Podracing was pointless. 




 Born with a penis, you're a man; born with a vagina, you're a woman. 




 How in the hell does anyone even find out about a glitch like that? 




 It wasn't obvious... hence my comment and the upvotes it received. 




 Not a hard decision at all.  GoT  TMNT 




 Yep.  [MyFitnessPal](http://www.MyFitnessPall.com) has helped me tremendously.  I'm on day 210 today. 




 Be sure you have some GOOD boudin while you're down. 




 Yep.  You got one from me.  Alabama is worse. 




 I've lived in [Louisiana](http://www.mapsofworld.com/usa/area-codes/maps/louisiana-area-code-map.jpg) (225 area code) my entire life of 34 years.

I've never eaten, snapping turtle, raccoon, nutria, opossum, muskrat, armadillo, or goat.

All the rest, I've had.  This place must be down in the bayou.  504 area code is New Orleans.  That's surprising.  I'd have guessed it was from the 337 area code. 




 Poor Dwight... Jim's gotten even worse with the pranks! 




 I won't lie; that was pretty damn cool. 














 Same here. I've ordered from ProFlowers 2 or 3 times. I've decided to go to a local florist from now on. Not as convenient as the internet, but at least the flowers won't be delivered uncut in a damn box. 




 While no longer cannon, the Dark Empire series was great. Read those in graphic novel form. 




 WHY?! We have 
 $18,140,773,498,471.70 USD in national debt, and we're STILL spending money on other countries' problems.  What the hell is wrong with our government?! 




 My FitBit alarm goes off, and I'm up and getting ready for the day. 




 I became to mature and civilized for 4chan. 




 [This was your PC today.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ruJBKFrRCk) 




 Reminded me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIAdHEwiAy8). 




 Sickening.

NO ONE'S faith or religious buildings should be treated this way.  Even a Satanic cult's building and faith.  I pray for them, but I wouldn't beat them up strictly for being a Satanist.

God is love, and Jesus taught us to treat others as we would treat ourselves. 




 My wife and I binge-watched it on Netflix over a few months from start to finish. It was awesome!
