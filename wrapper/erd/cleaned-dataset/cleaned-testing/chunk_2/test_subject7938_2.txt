 Did it make a sound? 




 Eva Green is the name of the BioRad PCR reagent we use. 




 No. 




 Is that from the top of the Stadium? 




 Yes, as you vaporize your gas would create a momentary buffer for your space ship. 




 You have cancer. 




 It looks to me like Solanum quitoense. 









 This is a common misconception. Adults invented cinnamon toast crunch. I personally put it in my coffee. 




 The real trick is to just spend one Sunday brushing your teeth and you are good to go for a year. 




 If Binge drinking 5 or more drinks, and the "bottle" is the unit of wine, does that mean I can drink 4 bottles of wine in a sitting without binging? 




 A catalyst stabliizes the intermediate molecule. You can think that in the process of the beginning products going to the ending products, this is a middle point where they are all together and it's some combination of bonds. Even "half bonds". This step is the unstable step. It takes a lot of energy to hold it in this step.

A catalyst, will take the two starting products, and stablize the half-bonded middle step. Then it could either slide back to start, or slide down to the lower energy end products.

All this essentially means it lower the barrier of the activation engery, allowing the reaction to more easily move to end point.

 If it's coming from all directions, the light receptors wouldn't meaure a difference between any two directions, so it would act like normal and grow upward due to gravity. 




 Oh damn! You are right! I knew I fixed that decimal the wrong direction. 




 There's no need to guess. It can be calculated. 




 Also, for reference, if the Earth was the size of a basball the moon would be about 7.5 feet away and the Milky way would be 3.4 billion miles wide.

Space is big. 




 Fun Question. So, The Milky way is about 100,000 light years in diameter. Andromeda is about 2.5 million light years away. So, Andromeda is about 25 time farther away than the milkyway is wide.

A baseball is 7.3cm in diameter. 7.3cm * 25 = 1.825 meters or about 6 feet.

Space is big.

Edit: misplaced a decimal. And Again 




 Yes, it's about that simple. Two things you might want to know though. Many plants (Magnolias included) prefer to be cross-pollinated, as in, pollen from one plant fertillizing the flower of a different plant. It's more robust on a genetic level for the species. You can self-pollinate (essentially inbreeding). It will work for Magnolias, but you may get a lower seed set than if you had another tree around.

The second is that some plants, to encouage outcrossing, mature the pollen and the stigma (the receptive female part of the flower) at different times. I don't think this happens in Magnolias, but to be safe try several flowers at once.

Good luck! 




 Yep, it will work. It's best when you can see the pollen grains starting to fall out of the stamens, just like in your photo. Fun fact: Magnolias are a very anceint lineage of flowering plants. They pollinated by beetles because when Magnolias evolved, bees were millions of years in the future. 




 It looks much more like an opportunistic infection. In other words, it moved in after the damage was done. Could you take a closer photo? As close as you can make it clear. 









 I'm a plant path grad student. I love it. I like biological interactions. It's a field (like much of biology) where you can spend your time in fields or forests or in the lab running constant PCR. 




 Looks like a Ganoderma. Likely Ganoderma tsugae. Nice shot! 




 Most of the time, no. If you compress it AND drop the temperature, then yes, almost all gases will form a solid at some point.

The reason a thing is a gas is becuase it has enough energy to overcome the molecules attraction to one another. This attraction is fairly weak for things that are gases at room temperature (hence why they are gases). If you take many gases and compress them, but keep the temperature around 70F (25C), they will form a [superfluid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfluidity). Superfluidity is a special and weird and very cool form of matter.  




 They also have 8 sets of chromosomes (Octoploidy) and most cultivated ones are hybrids between two continents. And are delicious.
