 "The floor is lava! That's the lava game, when you pretend that the floor is lava and you climb up on all the furniture. I see some of you don't get that. I don't care, that's okay. You might have called it something else, but it meant the same thing; you were poor. I'd tell my mom, "I want a Nintendo." and she'd reply "The floor is lava!" "What's wrong with our house? Why can't we afford better carpeting? It's called two jobs, bitch!" That's how I used to talk. I was very street" -Daniel Tosh  




 Can you imagine dropping and watching this video in its entirety? 




 They upgraded tv's and downgraded carpet from 50 years from the first 50 years

 I won the Pennsylvania lottery back in 1983 

My family quit Our jobs and we lived frugally 

Our lawyer took 1/4 of the $2,600 but he still remains a family friend to this day..

....?!?!?! $2,600 I'm assuming that's a typo 


It could have been $3,000 but we wanted the money up front  




 "Our pastor says that UFOs are proof"

"Proof that what?"

"That God"

 What's long and hard and full of seamen? 




 Thanks Patriot Act!  




 His name is junkyard Willie and he'll sell you hubcaps

 Demonic possession now available at Red box!

 You're "special" brother Daniel ;) 




 Hey Brother Daniel, you're a big p*ssy boy!  




 Guy just kept cleaning and didn't even care that the guy drove off lol like you Think any normal person would be like "hey sir I'm back here!"  




 I wonder how painful it would be to get that filled in with ink. Think about the stories you could tell...
"Cool tat bro where'd you get that idea?..

"Oh that's where I got struck by lightning back in '99"
...__ 




 Ah Fuck me in the goat ass 




 he says "sex time!". I said fine but only if he took off his knife hands

This had me fucking dying. 




 I've got the weirdest boner right now  




 Not a terrible movie, actually pretty comical at times. Not purposefully, either. 




 Who's the blonde? 









 Dex! Which season did you enjoy filming most? Least? 

In my opinion season 4 was the best. 

...now bring me one of those donuts! 




 Your girlfriend pulled a fast one on ya with the most elaborate setup yet. She "faked" sick   clued in one of her friends to your little game. She even planned it to the extent of when it would be storming and also pretended to be asleep. All the while snickering behind the door while you look for her and talk to yourself.  




 Is this a depiction of Noah and the Ark? 




 Cocaine is a helluva drug! 




 Exactly what the Fuck is this supposed to be? Dude cannot drive for shit either  




 Yeah I'm sure this one is similar to the brick above in regards to the screams. The officer truly was pleading for his life. And screaming after being shot multiple times. The sounds he makes in his final breaths are disturbing too, don't watch it. 




 Great parenting right here! World needs more selfless men and women like this. Well in this case girl :)  




 Slice of Life 




 That'd be perfect because if I raged I could just throw all my shit right in the river  




 He's all like "sup, bro?...don't mind me." 




 Love how the one chick responds with "why thank you!" Haha no shame  














 Yeah it's so sad. Such a storied franchise tarnished by such incompetence. It pisses me off more that they haven't come out with any statement since. Just tell us what's going on. Quit saying thanks for your continued patience. Nobody's been patient. You got the benefit of the doubt but two weeks later and nothings fixed.  




 Wait so someone escaped the cradle? Through your floor and out your door?!? Please update, OP! And a gun is useless unloaded btw  














 Wear pooka shell necklaces and Abercrombie clothes. And frosted tips. Nobody does that anymore unless you're Guy Fieri 




 Almost 24 hrs later and no fixes. Lol ok 3v4v3

 Still looking for Alan/Steve
