 Me and my old colleagues used to include the question of flight or invisibility during job interviews. It would really throw some applicants off, the creative ones were always hired....never failed.

 I know for sure... You want a good steak, you go to a steakhouse. You want a good kebab, you go to a kebab shop. You want a good burger, you sure as hell don't go to a kebab shop!

 I am continually saddened by the fact that this kind of information is no longer shocking to me... The income gap is so absurdly unbalanced that it would take an all out class war of the greatest magnitude to overcome.

 I'm sorry, but did you even read the article? It clearly states that, and I quote, "Although ancient peoples probably did not realize that fingerprints could uniquely identify individuals,[51] references from the age of the Babylonian king Hammurabi (1792-1750 BCE) indicate that law officials would take the fingerprints of people who had been arrested.[52]"

 Tried to post in /r/gaming but it wouldn't show up and mods never replied to my message...

So I was cleaning the floors in our bedroom and pulling all of the shit out from under our bed and I find these beauties in a box covered in dust. Now, I've never been much of a gamer, but I loved these two systems! The Game Boy Color still works, however, the screen on the Game Gear is not working. I can hear sound and barely see an image if I hold screen at an angle. Can it be repaired cheaply and easily?

Also (sorry).... What is this? Can I connect the Game Gear to my TV or monitor?

 Ok, so about 7 years ago, I was working out pretty hard and supplementing Creatine. I was taking the capsules, which you are supposed to swallow with a LARGE glass of water. Well, one morning I was running late for work, after the gym, and I throw the capsules in my mouth and swallow them at the water fountain. About a mile down the road my throat starts drying up severely and then I cough... POOF... Creatine powder everywhere and it tastes like shit so I start gagging until I pull over, open the door, and puke...and puke...and puke. The Creatine powder coated my throat so bad I couldn't stop gagging.

Also, I took my glasses off in the process of puking and set them on my seat... I sat on them and broke them when I got back into the car.

TL;DR Creatine and then sat on my glasses, breaking them.
