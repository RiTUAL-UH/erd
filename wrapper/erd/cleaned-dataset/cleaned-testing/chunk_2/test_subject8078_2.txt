 If your mom blew your dad instead, we wouldn't be having this convo.   




 Truth 




 Got him tagged as "Funny troll".  First time I've seen him in the wild, post-tag. 




 I've used [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mrchops.android.digihud hl=en) on my android.  It works pretty well, especially for being free. 

You just need to mock up some kind of holder for it.  




 And Montana, Alabama, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey, and some of those NE states.  




 Why not just tie something around the thumb?  No need to cut off blood supply to the rest of the hand/fingers.  




 Does Texas really need three teams?  I am sure San Antonio can support them, but aren't there more untapped markets out there?  Portland?  Louisville?  Other more obvious cities? 




 Well yeah, how many people are still alive that experienced the Hurricane of 1938 or 1944?  Yes Sandy was bad, but so were those two.  




 That's not Robin Williams.........Ohhh 




 /r/iamverysmart  









 I can point my gun at a baby (or person) as well.  I mean of COURSE I'm not gonna shoot them. Right? 




 For the first pick overall, Football Butt selects Vince Young 




 Does this Shark Week have anything true/informational in it?  Or is it another SyFy rip off, like in recent years?  I rather not waste my time watching fantasy crap.   









 Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend

Somewhere along in the bitterness

And I would have stayed up with you all night

Had I known how to save a life

 I've had multiple "shared interest" like that, but only liked one of the pages.  It's weird. 




 Why does it list **Arrested Development** twice under Shared Interest?  I've seen that multiple times.   




 Isn't the issue getting back to your home country.   




 That missed PAT and 2point conversion is looking bad now 




 WHAT A JUMP 




 I remember watching Webb when he played at UAB.  He looks the same, which is good 




 Half Cam half Tolbert 




 Is that Joe Webb?!!? 




 Get outta here you Krispy Kreme hating commie! 




 CLANK! 




 TOUCHDOWNNNNN!!! 




 Is the stadium noise coming through with these commercials? 




 LUUUUKEEE likes CPI Security?  So do I!! 




 Rather no Cam for the preseason, as long as he is 100% for the first game that matters.   




 20 YEARS of

###PANTHER **FOOTBALL** 




 So 2017 in Raleigh, and 2018 will be bought out 




 Wow, this guy puts /r/conspiracy to shame! 









 Could "Air Jordan" pay for the naming rights of TWC Center?  That would be sweet.

 [Edward Digges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Digges) served as one of the Colonial Governor of Virginia.  

On his [tombstone](http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr GRid=32117881) it states, among other things:
 "...He had issue **6 sons and 7 daughters** by the body of Elizabeth his wife who of her conjugal affection hath dedicated to him this Memorial."

The [Will](http://books.google.com/books?id=f8kWVOafFtQC lpg=PA170 pg=PA174#v=onepage q f=false) of Edward Digges only mentions "four boys and four girls"

---
In the book **[The Spirit in the South](http://books.google.com/books?id=QLETmBQzY8YC lpg=PA335 ots=mLJY-d6xnC dq=%22Catherine%20digges%22%20%22edward%20digges%22%20jamestown pg=PA335#v=onepage q f=false)**, it gives a lot of circumstantial evidence that Catherine is indeed the daughter of Edward.  

[Catherine](http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr GRid=68821007) married William Herndon in 1677.  William supported Nathaniel Bacon, and his [rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon's_Rebellion), which could have given cause for Edward to disown Catherine.  

According to this [post](http://genforum.genealogy.com/cgi-bin/pageload.cgi?doubts::herndon::457.html), the New England Historical and Genealogical Society doubts Catherine is the daughter of Edward.  But I can't find the actual document.  

Is there anything out there that could give more evidence towards lineage or not?  




 What the fuck is this fucking shit?! 




 Videos take too long to watch, gifs are easier and quicker  




 I missed the original vote!  Oh well 




 That sounds like a word from "The League" 




 Why isn't it "are"?  I was referring to a plural number of speakers? 

EDIT:  Thanks guys,  I think I have it! 




 How do you know if they are a native/fluent English speaker? 




 What's the world coming to? "You should know" basic grammar? I mean, you're taking "you should know" in the most literal sense here.


Implying every person in /r/YouShouldKnow are native/fluent English speakers.   




 It is a western thing.  OU (Oklahoma), CU (Colorado), KU (Kansas), NU (Nebraska), UU (Utah, ha), MU (Missouri).

Actually seems like a Big Eight thing.

 But you only need one person to oversee four (or more) self checkouts.  Normally, there would be one/two people per checkout line.   




 It looks like a bunch of ticks   




 When I first watched AD, I just assumed these people were doing cameos.  It didn't even occur to me they weren't famous yet.

And it also reminds me of Freaks   Geeks.  There were a NUMBER of future (and past) stars on that show.

 But it is different in Denmark and Germany compared to the US.

The 12th largest city in Denmark is Lyngby-Taarbka, which has a population of 51,887. Germany it's Leipzig with a population of 522,883.  The closest city to Leipzig is Tucson, Arizona with 526,116 (#33).

 Probably has to do with inciting our memory of 9/11 as well.   









 It would be neat to see these on-time performances ranked by track length.  I bet there would be some kind of correlation.

 Where can someone go to search for public records?  Almost everywhere I have looked, is through a private company and requires money.

 Well rewrite and cite it!

 Washington doesn't have "seatbelt" checkpoints or "license" checkpoints instead?

 How do y'all feel about [WikiPathways](http://wikipathways.org/index.php/WikiPathways)? 




 Oh those guys?  They've been here for a while! 




 I almost had this happen to me.  I had some random very specific question about Word, and couldn't find anything online.  So I called my university's IT support and asked them.  They had no idea, but gave me a number to Microsoft Office tech.  Called that number, everything seemed fine at first.  He remotely logged into my computer via Logmein. But "bells" started going off and he said I had a virus on my computer etc etc, but he could fix it.  At that point, I realized it wasn't Microsoft and I let some random person into my computer.

I shut down that conversation and ran a bunch of scans. I also spoke to the "higher level" IT people at my university and they ran stuff as well.  It sounded like a Scare scam to them.

They seemed to have gotten an old Microsoft phone number, but websites still has MS as the listed business.

Learned me a big lesson. 
 




 I understand that bra.  But its an obvious punchline.  Like Kevin Hart with his "I'm a small black man" stuff.  It would be really funny and unexpected if more jokes weren't about that.   




 Oh I get it.....it is cause he is fat.

It would be clever to come up with a non-fat punchline.

 When you type "Google" in the omnibox does it automatically change to www.Google.com, or will it search for "Google"?

 I didn't.  I got lost clicking on articles and ended up reading the background on this trial.

 Last Week Tonight with John Oliver did an amazing piece on stuff like this last Sunday.

When clicking the "+filter" [button](http://i.imgur.com/D4UWsce), only the [subreddit](http://i.imgur.com/r0f11TC.png) is added, not the needed "/r/".

So basically a fix is needed to add "/r/" with the specific subreddit.   




 First off, I love this extension.  It is extremely helpful reading the crap I am assigned, ha.  

Whenever the "Alt" button is pressed, paragraph's are highlighted in grey, allowing me to used Readline, if needed.  But it keeps you from clicking hyperlinks. (Which was EXTREMELY annoying, until I figured the Alt key was doing it.  I almost deleted it)

But I use the Alt-button for other tasks, mostly Alt-Tab to other window screens.  That task "activates" Readline, forcing me to go through the steps to unactivate it.

It's not a serious issue, but a major annoyance.  I am still pretty novice with the intricacies of your app, so there could be an easy fix on the user-side.  

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/zICJ6xD.png) are the settings I have currently marked.

Anything further I can help with, let me know!

Thanks again
