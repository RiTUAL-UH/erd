 Lyk dis if u cry evertim 




 Where are you that there's this much snow? Because there as hell doesn't seem to be that much anywhere else in Indiana. 




 So then who's the Tecmo Super Bo? 




 Fortunately we figured that out this year. 




 JUCO transfers like Aaron Rodgers I'd be ok with us taking. I don't want us taking guys who had trouble qualifying academically, but if it was a skill thing I don't see a reason we couldn't, or at least have 1 exception a year for it or something. 




 AXE Body Spray: Because who doesn't want to smell like a middle school locker room? 




 I won't miss his ability to somehow make our DBs forget how to cover. 




 Same idea but with icy hot. 




 Yeah I got eliminated from valedictorian my first semester of high school when I took electives. The salutatorian was 2nd because he accidentally took an extra art class freshman year. 




 I wish this was the first thread where I'd read about someone sticking their dick in milk today. 




 He did Parks and Rec instead. 




 Terrifying. 




 They said learned how to dress. 




 Every time I see a picture of Shaun White I think why is someone talking about Carrot Top? 




 Yeah I'm at Notre Dame and our highest paid employee is our investment officer. And he's still only making a fraction of what he'd make in the private sector. 




 I have full faith in us being the first 1 seed to lose in the first round if we ever get seeded that highly. 




 Your mistake for having faith in us to win. 




 I thought everyone thought that. 




 We finally found the one person who would hit the share button when watching porn. 




 My marketing class was basically teaching us how to do market research and what you needed to know. I.e. how to figure out where to sell, who to target, what types of products will be successful, etc. 




 Best: Notre Dame beating Stanford this year.

Worst: Losing to Boston College in 2002 or the Bartman play. 




 Seeley Booth vs. Angel.

On the other side of the spectrum, Miachel Cera as George Michael and Evan would be pretty even, too. 




 Lynyrd Skynyrd, Public Enemy, and Lady Gaga. 




 Buffy taught me no. 




 I work at my campus dining hall. This kid got fired while making personal pizzas for people for insulting students, throwing knives, and using the word "nigdick", his own invention. After he graduated, this wonderful human being enrolled in seminary, but then I ran into him at a bar later and learned he dropped out because "celibacy sucks". He is one of 2 people to have fired in probably the last 6 or 7 years, the other being a student manager who gave out tequila shots to students in the basement. Another was almost fired for dealing to full time staff, but he got arrested first. 




 Doubly so for /r/funny. 




 We had a presentation from a guy that does innovation for a beer company. The one time I didn't want to see a presentation on beer. 




 But Scotty doesn't know. 




 He went to IU though. 




 I had an RA that used to do this. 




 Click. That shit was supposed to be Adam Sandler playing with time and kicking people in the balls.  




 The Ivy League is all private. 




 Ring by Spring. 




 "Memories" 




 Should have masturbated more. We talk about prostate cancer plenty. 









 The fact that the B1G is all state schools except Northwestern doesn't help either. That has the potential of being on the wrong side of a lot of votes. 




 No parents no rules! 




 And so stylish. 




 I think now it's grad students that start it and goes to seniors. No more grad students splitting sophomores and juniors. 




 I hope it was [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxq-aOiGmQU). 




 The shower's in the toilet! That's amazing! 




 Debt can even be good if you can invest the money toward something with a higher rate than the interest you're paying. If I'm paying say 4% interest on my house and I have extra money after monthly payments, I could use that money to pay off extra money on my mortgage. However, given that the market tends to average somewhere between 8 and 12% in a year that's not a crash, you're usually better off investing that money elsewhere. 




 I had this same thing happen with my ex. 




 The only one I remember was someone bought condoms and a drug test. She paid all in singles. 




 This happens to me all the time Not having Friday classes really fucks with my head. 




 It make you look like Dwight. 




 Freitag just felt wrong though. There needs to be a Yeagley coaching there forever. 




 That's a cheap wedding. 




 Next: Beer 30! 




 Beer 30 has my favorite can ever though. 




 I took it as part of a job application. It was really easy. 




 Hamm's 




 Maybe LSU is just more willing to rise above it.

In all honesty it's most likely because of the way it was phrased. If they mentioned LSU doing it, too, Louisiana probably would have been ok with it. 




 I don't think anyone underrated Samardzija when he was here. Everyone knew he was awesome. I'd go with Jimmy personally. He had a great year for us his junior year, but had an awful o-line and a defense that didn't tackle, they just pushed. Was he an asshole? Yes. But a damn good player. 




 I've been really impressed with Wilson. I think he's going to lead you guys to a level that you haven't reached since Mallory. Also the win for Hoep in 2007 was just awesome. Considering how bad 2007 was for ND, IU at least gave me something to be happy about. 




 Fucking Gary Gray and Fucking Tommy Rees. 




 I don't think I've ever had a minimum time for presentations. Questions counting for time would screw me over every time because it'd end up pushing my presentations over the time limit. 




 Shit I just assumed that's what those were. 




 My nightmares of ND football all involve Tommy. 




 That has nothing to do with snow and everything to do with it being 465. That's awful driving no matter what time of year. 




 Hell yeah Chilly Willies. 




 What part of Indiana is this? Every part I've been in has been fine driving with snow. 




 Tell that to an accounting firm. 




 I'll agree with you on that first one. We have an assload of bandwagon fans. That's pretty much what leads to all of those other 3. We get preferential treatment because we have a lot of fans so our games = ratings and people will go to them as well. It's that combined with the fact that we have a fair amount of wealthy alumni, so they'll pay to go. 3 comes mostly from the bandwagon fans. Most alumni and students have the most pessimistic views of ND. As for 4, there's no reason for us to join financially so why should we? That comes from the first 2. 




 The Big Ten is an awful idea. I'd completely prefer the ACC. The ACC has schools that are way more similar to us, such as Duke, BC, Wake, Miami, and Syracuse. In the Big Ten we'd have Northwestern. I don't want to be one of the only 2 private schools in our conference. Conference affiliation need to be about more than athletics. Only reason I'd prefer the Big Ten would be to join the Committee on Institutional Cooperation. Still don't want to join one though. 




 He threw a really pretty ball by his junior year, too. I don't think he gets enough credit for how good he was his last year because he spent 3 years with a defense that didn't know how to tackle. 




 If it's in the game, it's in the game. 




 It won't be 600. It'll be 599 US Dollars. 




 I felt like in this scenario it was the equivalent of shouting while someone is talking and saying I can't hear you.

"Please stop writing to me"

"I can't understand a word you're saying" 




 We had a 3 week debate 2 years ago about them. Started by a guy who was against them. 




 He didn't end up taking it I think. I think that was before he came back for another year to get enough credits for the CPA exam. 




 That engineering wasn't for me. Almost failed out of school before I realized it. Made the switch to business and I've enjoyed it so much more and done way better. 




 I used to live in Bloomington, so IU apparel was huge there. I worked at a Kmart, and there was one month we got a huge shipment of Oklahoma gear. I'm pretty sure someone fucked up because of the similar logos. Needless to say they didn't sell very well. 




 A friend of mine took a year off from college because he had cancer. At an interview the interviewer said "I notice you took a year off from college. Were you spending a year finding yourself?" in kind of a smarmy tone. He of course replied no, he was fighting cancer. He got an offer. 




 My roommate did this for a summer and only sold one thing. But he referred a guy who got really into it and so he made a bunch from that. 




 Fucking magnets, how do they work? 




 But that means you're missing Pigtostal! 




 We've got a couple of those. 




 It's not that we're too good to join a conference, it's that there's no reason for us to. We're not going to join one for the sake of joining one. 




 We've won national championships in women's soccer, fencing, and women's basketball recently, and are competing in each of those every year. We're also really strong in men's soccer, men's lacrosse, and men's hockey, and have a good but not great men's basketball program. I think our tennis teams are usually pretty good, too. Women's lacrosse has also been good in the last few years. Our rugby team was good until they got disbanded for selling the vans they rented to go on a trip in the 90s to buy alcohol and drugs, but it's back and doing alright. 




 Except in 1989. 




 This is why I don't want us to join the Big Ten. No desire to be on the wrong end of a bunch of 2-whatever votes. 




 It shouldn't take Mad Men for you to realize this. 




 I think I'd take another year of Eifert over Rudolph honestly. It'd be pretty close. I also think we're weaker at WR next year than TE so I'd probably go with Golden. Plus Golden was just awesome. 




 Mendoza! 




 And as Amy Poehler once said, BC is the Harvard of Boston. 




 Someone never read [The Official Pokemon Handbook](http://i.imgur.com/YOkOqpo.jpg) as a kid. 




 But whips and chains excite her. 




 For Love of the Game as well. Awful book, great movie. To a lesser extent, Field of Dreams also. 




 Always glad to help. 




 Seems like you would have had trouble typing that then.

 ND-USC has been much more consistent as a rivalry than ND-Michigan though. We've been playing playing USC almost every year since the 20s. Michigan has been off and on. 




 All girls are suckers for that neckbeard. 




 Quick! Someone call Kevin Bacon! 




 Would have been better if she'd said wicked smart. 




 I'd never have believed it if he hadn't assured me it was true. 




 No that's just katy. 




 And that's why you always leave a note.
