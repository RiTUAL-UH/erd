 So in a toaster, there must be something that controls the amount of heat allowed to be put in the wirey things that make the heat.

In theory, could I take out or disable whatever this is and put the toaster together and see what happens? Instant toast?  



















 THANKS CRATE AND XYSTED FOR SHOWING ME THE LIGHT 














 I'm doing a presentation on depression in adolescence for my sociology class and since I have no friends or people to survey at my school I'd like to ask you guys some questions here if that's allowed. If only teens could answer that'd be ideal, but if you guys remember being depressed as teens/have had depression since your teen years I'd love those answers too. 

1. How old are you?  
2. Are you male of female?  
3. At what age were you diagnosed with depression?  
4. What is depression like for you?  
5. What is the root of your depression?  

If this type of post then I don't mind if it's deleted, but if you guys could answer I'd love to bring light to this topic in my presentation. This survey would help a lot.  




 I really want to do a loadout with all OD green gear, or a mixture of OD green and tan. I'm mostly leaning towards all OD though because camo can be a hassle and I just want something simple, effective, and that won't break the budget. 

How effective can solid color loadouts be? Do any of you guys have solid colored loadouts you could post for reference?  









 I got my feels hurt :( 




 I'm super excited. Not sure of the quality but there are plenty of seeders and the comments say it's good quality.

 I keep getting flooded with different suggestions from Meep and Dacrate and I just need a solid list of three shows. Lately my thing has been slice of life, shit with good lessons at the end of show, mind fucks, , and good character development (i.e. toradora, mikakunin de shinkoukei, sakurasou no pet na kanojo, welcome to the nhk)

I need answers and options people, shoot.  





























 Cameroncock said it would be today and I can't find anything saying so nor do I have the one year club thingy. I was assuming that I'd get that right when it was my cakeday or something. What do. I want to shitpost mp5k on /r/airsoft.  




 What are your guys' New Years resolutions? Mine is to do more meaningful things and to be better than I am now.  




 lolwut

I DIDN'T SPELL ANYTHING WRONG 









 I looked up the soundtracks and bgm's on youtube and I can't seem to find the song I'm looking for. It sounds like there are some sorts of deeper string instruments, and it plays during the scene that the Sleeping Knights are taking their picture by the wall. It also plays before this when Asuna and Kirito are flying back to their cabin they lived in during the Aincrad arc. It appears countless other times in the show but this is all I could think of for how to find it off of the top of my head. Any help would be great, I need to download this song somehow.  









 I've decided on playing a designated marksman/sniper-ish role and I've been researching a lot of different rifles and found myself really digging really long snipers and guns of the 7.62 variety. After looking around I thought a G3 would really fit this role. Sadly, the only decent option would be the Classic Army G3, which I can't find in stock anywhere or the Tokyo Marui G3, but I don't like ordering from non-American retailers because of shipping price. This left me with the option of the JG G3, or the Marui PSG-1 which I was far more welcoming of. Also, I love how it looks and it's *loooooong*.

After digging through pages of Google searches and picking through YouTube trying to find a decent review or video of it in action, I couldn't find much. All that I really got out of my research was that it had a weird air nozzle or cylinder or something, it's old, and it's **creaky.** The creaky thing was the most stressed out of anything, which I don't really mind. 

Now, I'm not the tech savviest guy. I can change a hop-up, motor, and some other junk. Nothing too godly. My concern is that this gun won't perform as I need it to stock, and I'm not sure I can do what I need to get it shooting great. I know there are plenty of other guns in the price point that will outperform this gun a thousand times over, but I can't get over the great look of the PSG and I want something unique. 

Will the Marui PSG-1 be worth it if I get it? Will it make all of my wildest operator dreams come true? Or should I get researching another option for my designated marksman adventures? 




 I'm delving into the world of sneakier gameplay and the designated marksman sort of role, and have mostly everything planned out. Except for a side arm. Now I've had bad experiences with GBB's and I want something that I can play with all year that won't die on me. Now I've narrowed down my choices and read/watched about every review about some of my choices, but I'm still iffy.

Tokyo Marui MP7 AEP is my first choice because I've heard nothing but good things about it, I heard that it's quieter and have seen videos of it shooting and it seemed quieter than the normal AEG/AEP. 

My next choice would be the Galaxy/CYMA MP5K but it's hard to find in the US and I've heard mixed reviews about it. What's nice about the MP5K is that it uses a normal gearbox so maintainence isn't as big of a deal. 

My final choice would be the JG MAC-10 or possibly the marui, but I want to keep it HK for the sake of my guns matching. The JG seems nice though and sturdy. It's also really really quiet from the videos I've seen of it shooting. 

I'm stuck and I don't know what to do. What are your guys' opinions? Are any of these a good choice? Do you guys have any good options or ideas? 




 All of my what, http://www.evike.com/products/50670/ 
























 To give a little background, I just turned 17 on the third, don't know if this has anything to do with anything. Some of my Reddit friends may see that I posted this, I don't really care. I want to travel the world and I want more now. I live in a shitty small town of only 1,000 to 1,200 people. At this point in my life my grades are only good enough to get out of highschool. I own a small business doing graphic design and articles, and I wash dishes at a local restaurant and started training to cook, but that won't get me anywhere. I need to take charge but it's so hard. When I graduate I'm either going to be a neet, or working my shitty jobs living in a shitty apartment. Now, I've had plans to take two years of general studies and get some sort of art degree, but I don't think that will get me where I want to be or anything. I just want to help people and see the world, and get away.

Now that that's out of the way. I would follow my uncle's footsteps and join the military, but even then I don't think it'd be worth it. I don't believe in anything that we're fighting for. Would joining the peace corps or whatever work? Should I just pack up and leave when I turn 18 and freelance? I'm at my wits end, but the only thing I really want now is to be away and to help people.  




 I thought it was bullpups, ak's, and other things but I've finally realized, it's 7.62 stuff with big magazines. SCAR-H's, FAL's, M14's, G3's. Love em'. 









 In a group of friends we are conducting one of the first studies on weaboos, why they happen, and other stuff. We're even going as far as going to an anime con to interview ourselves some weabs and get primary source information. Then we're filming it all, and making a documentary. Wish me luck. You guys got any articles or sources? 














 I got this idea for a show. You take a bunch of tactical gear with googly eyes and attach them to strings like puppets, and the main character is a shemagh with googly eyes who has a blog. They are all best friends. It would be called, "Shemagh with a Blog."

Let's make millions.  
 




 Feelsgoodman. 





























 I have to record all results so I have to put that and the sweary words in my report lol. She probably won't care though and I got enough info to complete the assignment, thanks.  














 I just stuffed that fucker with toilet paper and turned it on over and over again. By the time I was done it was making smoke. Should I go back and stop it?

You know, with your obsession with Russian stuff lately this only makes sense.  




 **SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY** ONLY WITNESS THE HANDICAPPED HORROR, THE BED RIDDEN BEDLAM, AND THE RETRIBUTION OF THE RETARDED. IT'S GOING **DOWN**. 




 If they ever made a live action movie of the anime Steins;Gate, [Keanu Reeves] (https://hollywoodhatesme.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/keanu-reeves.jpg) would be perfect for the part of the main character [Okabe Rintarou] (http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/122643.jpg) if he slicked back his hair messily. 
 














 All of the sudden I have this harem of SMG's I want to buy and I am very confuse. It's between the new [Echo 1 Spectre] (http://www.evike.com/products/49769) and the [KWA Scorpion.] (http://www.evike.com/products/49710) Turns out Tuesday I got paid so now I have $200~ more than I thought. I'm on the verge of just buying both guns. Will I regret this decision? I still have to pay my dad for my car but that would only be another month of work. I am confuse.  




 Now all Eastern bloc and Russian guns seem cool to me. The want started with an AKS-74UN then to RPK, but now I just want to buy everything Russian and Eastern European. Fuck.  




 [Linkerino.] (http://www.evike.com/products/49710/)

I'm thinking of just picking one up next check for plinking around and for fun until more magazines come out. Also, people will be scouring YouTube for reviews and even if I put out a average to shit-tier review people will eat it up and I'll get views.  




 And yes EzDeezer, I know American Psycho is. *Shhhhh*

I haven't watch anything but Comedy Central and anime for months so my knowledge of movies is pretty dead. Also I need shit to read and keep me busy in class. 

**DISCUSS** 









 Drawing sucks. I will post my shitty art project tomorrow because it is ber operator. 

Have any of you guys even taken a shitty drawing class? 


































 Look promising at least. I've still had my HERO2 for awhile so it might be time for an upgrade. What action cams do you guys have?

Edit: Linkerino, http://www.evike.com/products/49539/ 









 That is all. Also I know about the other chat sub for the super secret cool kids so you guys should approve me.  














 If so, **OH MY GOD IT'S SO MUCH MOR-** 

They're making  up for that last season if you ask me, but now there's guns and stuff so it's like 25% better.  




 So every day of the week is dress up, and I think that I'm going to dress up like a terrorist as a joke. Monday is dress like a hero day so I think that'll be funny.  




 I think pudding is a beverage.  




 Usually I get up do all of my morning stuff and go to school. Today I grabbed a handful of anxiety medicine and some sort of pain killers and jammed them in my pocket. Took something my dad was taking for eye surgery pain and that made the walk to school way better. It was fucking awesome. 

Walking to school was awesome. Sitting in class was awesome. I actually talked to people and didn't give a fuck about how I looked. Psycho ex girlfriend's friend stabbed me in the hand with a pencil and I shrugged it off and called her a stupid cunt. Everything was fun and had meaning. It was weird. 

Whenever I would get in trouble in class before the teacher said what I did bad I would just take the detention, tell them what I did, explain why I know it's wrong and why I have fun being a dick, and then I'd go off to my next class. They didn't even have anything to say I was so on top of shit all day.  














 That is all. They didn't like my shitty average M4. Should I take a picture of it on my bed in the dark with a cellphone or something, because there are people who are getting more upvotes just doing that.  









 It's like six terabytes of the word poop and I'm going to put it in the shared files so a bunch of people open it. *Hue hue hue* 














 Supposedly there's a bunch of methane in Texas drinking water or something the front page told me. Catbrain needs to light the water from his tap on fire and post the results.  









 They don't though.  
What things do you guys like to dip in coffee? I like me a good apple cider doughnut or cinnamon Poptart with my coffee. One time I even dipped beef jerky in coffee (who knows why) and it tasted pretty good.  









 Found it on /r/teenagers, just type in mermur.it and it'll pop up.  









 I know the SRC is more realistic, and the KWA is better performance wise, but this gun is a nice middle ground. Should I get this pistol and take the risk? I know it will be better than the SRC because I've seen shotty reviews on the SRC. The SRC looks like a better collector's weapon than a skirmishing weapon. I really want a TT-33, and I really want a pistol. [The gun in question.] (http://www.evike.com/products/44404/) 




 I'm so tired and depressed I can't even force any jokes today. Feels like I'm going to crash and burn.  




 I don't think it's too bad for a first time

 What would happen if someone were to poo in a metal box, and then weld a lid on there and leave the box for a few years. Like, would the poo be gone?  




 I wish there was a game like Skyrim with a vast free roam and mountains, but imagine if there were huge and unimaginable monsters and beasts. Like mind boggling size and awe. I've always been fascinated with that concept and I wish something would come out. I'm talking like [this] (http://i.imgur.com/I6Vh4L1.jpg) big that just roam around and shit. The best part would be landscapes like Skyrim where you can just fucking go and go man.  




 Makes you feel like you're fucking autistic and when you have no missing assignments on a Monday you get a treat like a fucking child. There's also this point system she's talking about with coupons like I'm in second grade. The only upside is that I can usually burn through two episodes of an anime and she doesn't notice. Wtf.  




 I have no clue what is happening. I just take everything home and do it there. 









 Do not watch this. It will make you sad. 

:( 




 :( 




 I am seeing if we can or not by posting this. Don't mind little old me. 

Edit: No, no we can't. 
*Sigh* 




 Now I have to wait six days to watch the new SAO? Last week I could watch it right when I woke up. Now I can't watch it before going to my shitty job like I always do. Wtf.  




 So right after I grabbed on to the casket to pallbearerer or whatever my phone went off. The Fresh Prince of Bell Air theme song. It rang throughout the crowd of appalled family members and the large cemetery. Since the casket was so heavy, and we were already carrying it I couldn't get to my phone to turn it off and the phone was left in my pocket to play the whole time we carried it to the grave. What the fuck. Why.  




 Just kidding they aren't. I don't want to go. I am not sad and I don't care that the relative that died is dead. This is more painful to me because now I can't go to work tonight. I would rather make money.  




 What is happening I am very confuse. 

Edit: I am not learning anything wtf 




 I'm a fairly short guy and I ordered a Barrett as most of the regulars on the sub know. I've watched a lot of videos but I never realized how big the Barrett actually is. It's like 4.7 feet long, and I'm not a very tall guy. Will this be fine? Will I die of exhaustion just heaving it around?  









 This thing just began working so I can post some shit. I have nothing to post, but do you guys have to deal with stupid shit like this? School issued Ipads or anything? 




 Yeah it just turned on and has been running on the charger for about ten minutes. Lel.  









 After five years of usage my DSi died today. It's been across the US from Wisconsin, to South Dakota. It's even been to Canada. My DSi has gone with me through various moves, and different houses as well. I was 11 when I first got it. I remember going to Gamestop with my dad to get it, and being first in line at the stroke of 12:00 AM. I remember the giddy excitement and first turning it on and tinkering with it during the car ride home. I remember pure joy. 

It didn't have a name or anything, just my initials carved in the back. I've beaten countless games, and played through many games of Pokemon with it. I've beaten many people too with my DSi, and won many battles. I've had many great times during lunch with friends playing Pokemon,  trading, battling. I've had countless adventures. I've had many a good memory with my DSi in hand. 

Over the course of the past five years I've taken my DSi all over the US. When I was 11, I took my DSi to Washington, Alaska, and even Canada. I remember taking it to the top of the Seattle Space Needle, and through the bustling Pike's Place Fish Market. While taking a cruise in Alaska I played my DSi looking to the open ocean. I took it to the beautiful Butchart Gardens of British Columbia, Canada. When I was living at my grandfathers farm my sisters and I took a trip to South Dakota. I remember sitting in the beating sun looking over the barren Badlands with my DSi in hand. I even took pictures of a rabbit we found with my DSi. 

While moving from my grandfathers house to where I lived on the golf course I remember buying Pokemon White, the game I played until today. By now the corners were smashed/damaged and the L and R buttons on top didn't even work. As long as I could play Pokemon I was content. While working on the house, painting, and during the move I remember good times defeating the new game while taking breaks. While living at this house though I took a break from my DSi. This time was spent diving into the world of Call of Duty and X-box, so I would fit in with others. My DSi took it's rest in my desk drawer collecting dust. 

A year or so would pass, and eventually I would move into the house I am living in now. During the move I found my DSi, and dug up a charger. After plugging it in, bingo, it worked. I started a new game on Pokemon White and began to play a lot more. My X-box had become repetitive, but I found time for both game systems. This past year was the most time I had ever spent playing on my DSi and I even made a good friend in the process. 

With the introduction of school issued I-pads I figured, more people were playing games, and if I were to play my DSi nobody would care. This I was correct on, and I would begin my day in Photography class on Pokemon White smart mouthing the teacher. This I regret, however playing I do not. I would find time in the hallways to play, during my study halls in the school library, and in Geometry class. I had been playing one day during lunch and a now good friend Jacob struck up a conversation about what I was playing. Before this I never talked with about much, and Pokemon became our common ground. Every day we would play during lunch and get stronger, battle, trade. This past year was great, and my DSi was being used to it's full potential. 

Today, while waiting for my student teacher conference I sat in the car, and sipped on my cup of coffee. I felt around in my pocket for my DSi, which I always carried with me. I flipped it open as usual, clicked and tapped away, and played Pokemon like usual. While playing the screen froze. Odd enough, but I thought it was probably the cartridge. I turned it off, closed it, and took out the game. I inspected the game, and the slot. Everything seemed normal so I plugged the game cartridge back in and turned it on. It turned on, but the screen was white. It remained frozen and then shut off. Since the battery was fully charged from the night before, I attempted to turn it on again. Nothing. I had assumed the worst, closed my DSi, and came to terms with it's demise before going to my conference. 

5 years of pure joy is what my Nintendo DSi had brought me, and it was worth every penny. There are so many other adventures I've left out of this, but so many that will not be forgotten. I used my DSi until the day it couldn't run, and simply couldn't turn on. 5 years of pure joy.

 I have one last chance to make my last day of summer mean something. 

Just kidding, I'm probably going to watch anime and eat in the dark while people do things and don't invite me.  









 Mine was probably about a minute ago, I picked up a sock to blow my nose and it was  a fap sock. I still blew my nose with it though. 

Either that, or to get my current job I got the old cook re-addicted to crack so he would get fired.  









 Ground up.  




 Pretty shitty last day to say the least, and I had it all planned out to make it the best last day of summer ever. 

**Fuck Up No. 1**  
I planned to go for a walk with this girl I like and then go back to her place to play guitar and shit. This was supposed to be at 12:00 in the afternoon, I woke up merely twenty minutes ago as I write this.

**Fuck Up No. 2**  
My pizza oven broke and my regular oven isn't working. I really really wanted a stuffed crust Tombstone pizza to lift my mood.

**Fuck Up No. 3**  
The girl mentioned before called me. You know when you answer the phone and you're nervous and you accidentally hang up? Ha, well of course that happened. Oh also, now she thinks I'm mad at her. 

**Fuck Up No. 4**  
So when I'm bummed out, sometimes shooting my airsoft guns is fun. I went to grab my good ol' [JG AUG] (http://i.imgur.com/BqMGLVH.jpg) from the wall to plink around at some cans. It would not fire. I take off the barrel and receiver and look around inside looking for some sort of answer. Nothing. Fucked. My dad is letting me order my new gun when he gets home anyways, so hey not too bad. 

**Fuck up No. 5**  
My grandmother died. Fell down the stairs, hit her head, aneurysm, whatever. I don't care that she died, I just don't want to miss work for a funeral. I want to make money. Also, I have to be a pallbearer and I don't want to carry heavy things while people stare at me. Fuck. 

Well at least I have some anime and instant coffee to make this day at least 25% better. How is/was your guys' last day of summer?  



















 My friend called me a bitch, I ain't even mad. Now I hear [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-t06qBtiJk) song and get bummed out.  









 Their new album is out October 7th if any of y'all are stoked. I know I'm super fucking pumped because I'm 83% sure it will redeem their last piece of shit. The name of the album is kind of lame though (Everything Will Be All Right in the End) so we'll see.  




 I'm such a loser that I've watched so much anime to know what some of the Japanese stuff says. 

HA.  




 I was just having a conversation with a friend and realized this, I mean I guess that's how any band name is formed but still. 

Like, "Ricky Ross and the Staplers"  
"Plywood and Pete"  
"Street Curb something something"  
"Camera Lense McCarmichael and the Nickel Train" 

The possibilities are endless.  




 Well I guess how they smell is a matter of opinion, but I'm talking about [these] (http://stinkbugsguide.net/brown-marmorated-stink-bug.jpg) little fuckers. But you know I always thought, where do they come from? What do the little baby ones look like?

Well, while I was cleaning up dog poo today I looked in the garden wheelbarrow where there were some old zucchini and sure enough, there were [little baby ones living all over it.] (http://i.imgur.com/P8o8A93.jpg) 

Sorry, the picture is bad because they were flying at me and stuff, but they were the same thing. I'm like 97% percent sure.

Edit: Well fuck I guess I can take [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwPsqP87l64feature=youtu.be) too.    




 This is somewhat random but I just stumbled upon the thought reading some manga. 
 
For me, 

**1.** Coffee  
**2.** Elite Force BB's  
**3.** New book/manga  
**4.** The oven at work  
**5.** Autumn leaves  

What about you guys?

Edit: Oh yeah, A1 steak sauce. That stuff is my shit.  




 I told him that just because the gun is heavy doesn't mean it's realistic and he replied,

 "I know but I mean the heaviness makes it feel like you have a real weapon. Air soft is a great sport don't get me wrong but paintball is more of a rush when playing since being shot in the head with a paintball gun can kill you if they cheat where as with air soft gun hurt but the worst it can do is break skin or hit an eye."

Wat. 

Edit: I looked up the annual injuries in paintball, averaging around 20 per every 100,00 annual players. I also showed him a chart and demolished this argument. I'll post what he says next. 

Another Edit: He said he had to go do chores and that the argument was over. Ha. 

 




 Yeah, it doesn't work worth shit. Fuck whoever told me this. 

Also, Starbucks Instant coffee packets actually taste like real coffee and they don't taste bad.  




 I want some to randomly put in montage parodies or airsoft montages. I like [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upkYQqbrjSc) song. 

You guys got any?
