 Hes retired  




 It was a movie about a guy who lost his family in a car crash and the girl who killed them a drama story basically, it could have been its own movie without the Other Earth storyline.  




 Yeah I mean it was a good movie I liked it but just seems like a huge wasted opportunity.  




 Yeah the first one was stupid but I did like the AVP fight scene thats about it. The second was a little better but not that much.  




 Another Earth  




 Its pretty good cant wait to see what the rest of the season brings!!!!!!  




 Yeah she is now the new Jennifer Lawrence and Shailene Woodley.  




 She was a little underrated before both this and Jack Reacher made her a little bigger. Hopefully she gets some well deserved recognition for this one!!! Might I also mention that she was very sexy in GG too.  




 Yes she was really good in it I am hoping this movie raises her profile more.  




 I dont think neither won its left deliberately ambiguis.  




 I watched a trailer for this movie with Haley Joel Osment called Home of the Giants and it literally gave away the entire movie. I felt bad now after watching the trailer first from that point on I never do that.  




 Maybe  




 I liked it, it was Homeland I like how they have a new start with new storylines and stuff. Just what this show needs.  




 Whenever I have an argument or someone has wronged me I usually imagine myself getting revenge on the person often in horrific ways. Example I was fired a few months ago and the boss was so unforgiving about it he is an ass and sometimes I imagine myself returning to work there and taking him out. the same with my dad I dont like him that mush and I imagine making him pay. Just thought I would put that to writing.  




 I also remember a movie with Robert Redford and Willem dafoe called The clearing that is rated R for literally 1 F bomb.  




 As well as some graphic nudity.  




 I Love You Phillip Morris.  




 Lost in Translation is rated R for one brief scene of nudity but I have seen other pg13 movies with more nudity than that that didnt get R.  




 jax doesnt know that he was high when he said it plus he doesnt really have a good track record with the club.  




 I wish he had killed Lin and all of his guys that way he can be done with this pointless vendetta.  




 thats what I was thinking and I hope that that happens.  




 Me too what scares me the most about that is that it can actually happen that thought just gives me the shivers.   




 I just used my fist to break my fall that was it.  




 Just leave dude dont let your life get any worse.  




 Yeah true.  




 Its entertaining, thats about it.  




 I dot have a job ATM so whenever I somehow scrape together some cash and I am a little short I go into my dads room and grab a few quarters. Over the past year it must have equaled 20 dollars. I kinda feel bad but not really cuz he is an asshole.  




 Jesus FUCKING CHRIST!!!!!!! I didnt mean to hit you it was an accident I tripped and hit you on the back with my fist it was a complete accident you did not need to act like i actually hit you for no reason because I didnt!!!!! And you made me look like a fool in front of my fucking MOTHER!!!!!!! You are a piece of shit I always hated you!!!!!! You dont know what an accident is or use common sense like I was trying to explain to you, you just started yelling at me for no fucking reason!!!!! You are a piece of shit and I officially hate you now.  




 Mike Myers - The Love guru  




 Charlie Wilson is indirectly responsible for 9/11.  




 it took WAY to long to come out and it just wasnt as good as its predecessor.  




 Yes  




 Never seen it.  




 Good one  




 What are some good ones???  




 Best Actress fo sho if she gets a nom tho.  




 Yes she probably went to China for a few years in the universe anyways.  




 I used to get Abbie Cornish and Katherine Heigl confused 
 




 Christopher Meloni and Elias Koteas  




 YES!!!!!!!!!!!  




 Also because of all the nudity and stuff plus I thought anything Gay related automatically got an R Rating.  




 Joe Dirts dad  




 I always wondered why Chuck and Larry is Rated PG13 it seems R Rated to me.  




 LOVED it it was an exact adaptation of the book also loved the performances especially Rosamund Pike she was so DAM SEXY in that movie!!!!!!  




 Yes he is a good actor and one of my favorites I wish he would become an A Lister again. He just needs the right role I guess.  




 Exactly.  




 I didnt like it at all I wish at least one of them died or something. Cant wait to see the movie tho!!!!!  




 Fina-Freakin-LY  




 Bale  




 let the Harry Potter jokes begin!!!!!  




 Breaking Bad  




 They r all about the same but my personal favorite out of the 3 is Phoenix he is so good in all of his roles.  




 Tusk and I want my mind erased of everything I knew about the movie beforehand too so I could watch it blind.  




 yes I will.  




 LOVED IT!!!!! A bit disturbing at some parts but still funny and weird all at the same time.  




 Yes  




 halloween the original.  




 Interesting  




 Yeah I am, almost done with the book just like 80 pages left and stuff.  




 K I got some reading to do then but first i have to finish Gone Girl in time for Friday LOL.  




 Oh alright im gonna keep going I think I heard Brans storyline doesnt add up in the books and tv show anyways.  




 Yes thats why they became decepticons they r basically Megatrons Children.  




 Alright cool I will keep reading then, its just so long and I already know whats gonna happen.  




 BOOOOOOOOOOOO  




 I am currently reading the Game of Thrones books and I am on book 2 a clash of kings but I am wondering if I should just skip ahead to book 4 because I have already seen the tv show and know what happens. what should I do??  




 I liked it a very realistic revenge film and well made to for a debut film.  




 cool  




 Gemmas secret not getting out.  




 Yeah I like seeing them at church now it doesnt really happen that much.  




 Wolverine 3 will come out a year later I believe.  




 All  




 Star Wars  




 Yes would love to see more of Davids adventures and what villains he would encounter.  




 Yeah he is a good actor wish he was in more movies that would challenge him tho instead of just playing Bruce Willis all the time.  




 Mostly cuz he is a part of a worldwide Cult but aside from that I like him he is a good actor and I have only seen him in a few bad movies.  




 Good  




 Did u miss Mel Gibson???  




 The Cabin in the Woods I thought it was gonna be another horror movie where everyone dies but I was pleasantly surprised now it is one of my favorite movies.  




 Furry Vengeance happened.  




 Why is there a picture of Godzilla???  




 i am a student studying something else now and i am currently looking for a new job.  




 I went to film school for a year and a half.  




 I agree with everything u just typed I hope Dumb to will bring his career back and that he will become a leading man again it has been forever and yeah I dont think I will ever watch Mr Poppers Peguins even if he is in it. He is like my all time favorite actor.  




 Jim Carrey  




 Finally some good news about this project.  




 Yeah Jax will probably fuck him over and stab him in the back like he does to everyone.  




 Yeah Jax will probably fuck him over and stab him in the back like he does to everyone.  




 Oh yeah thats what I like.  




 It is awesome nothing can stop it now!!!! I am glad AOS is here that way I can get my weekly dose.  




 It could go either way I wouldnt mind seeing Marks be a badass again and actually killing someone.  




 So the club is now going to kill at least 3 people every episode now?? AWESOME!!!!!   




 Yes loved that part its good to see Marks threatening people again instead of being all goody goody.  




 Not really movie news plus that is Colin Farrell  




 Cant wait for the trailer!!!!  




 Not at all  




 Oh yes and IMO there has never been a more perfect time to play that song in a movie.  




 Thank you  




 Denzel Washington, Tom Hanks also Jim Carrey  




 Interesting theory how have I not thought of this already.  




 LOL  




 O okay well I am not religious even if I was I wouldnt care LOL.  




 I have always wanted to read the books and see what happens. I think I will now.
