 Same thing happend to me. Only way I was able to settle this was to show PROOF of ownership by looking up my modem s/n via the manufacturer website. Actually, proof that Comcast didn't purchase it. For Arris/Motorola/General Instruments, you can provide proof of ownership via:

 No, I'm just a pissed off Comcast customer with no choice but to use them for internet service.

 Yea - I think a rep reviews and will reply. Try calling them up if you don't hear back. They're required to provide you with this information.

 If you watch TV via digital set-top, it's a data transmission. So if you leave your set-top on 24/7, how come that's not being charged for usage?  

My point is, it shouldn't matter how much data is used, just like the air you breath.
