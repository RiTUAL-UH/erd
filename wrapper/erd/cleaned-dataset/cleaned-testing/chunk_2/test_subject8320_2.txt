 Dude I know... BS2 gets hate sometimes but I loved it, while the story did have afew plot holes I felt it improved on everything else especially combat and atmosphere (plus Minerva's den is probably one of my fave DLC's of all time) 




 Didn't superman kill more people in MOS then Godzilla in the latest Godzilla film?
 




 Should I buy it? (I own all the bioshocks and love them all to death especially BS2)
EDIT: Bought SS2 and I'm really surprised on how well it holds up (game play wise any way) It was definitely worth the 3$ and I also am hearing some sound effects that were used in BS1   




 I found a bunk file in my uninstall, removed it and everything is fine now :)  




 At my school some kids have speakers in their back packs... Needless to say its fucking irritating  




 Thanks :) 




 Recently I downloaded VLC media player off a bad site and it screwed with internet explorer and chrome (slower then normal and pop-ups). I was able to find where the junk files installed and deleted the file and completely cleared my browser cash but chrome is still running slow and while it happens a lot less then before I'm still getting pop-ups. Virus scans show nothing (windows defender) (I don't know my specs from memory so I will update this later if need be). 




 Wow man! Thanks for this, I could never really pin down what nu-style was so I guessed as much but form the bottom of my heart... Thanks :) P.S. Yoji is awesome (still trying to find a place where I can buy airport :/) 




 One of Shingo's older songs, the kick isn't great and with youtube being what it was back in 09 the quality is a little rough. Look past that however and you will be hooked! P.S. If your into speedcore check out Shingo's other alias Round Wave Crusher (RWC) 









 I AM RADIATING HYPE LIKE A SUPER SAYAN! 




 I see what you mean 




 I use to draw the line at Gabber but now I've heard it all, Speedcore all the way up to extra tone. I traveled to the edge of the abyss, listened and enjoyed what I heard :^ ) 




 :( I didn't get to see the show because the the venue was 18+  




 Slum Village - Fall in love (Moody Good Remix) 




 Life with a monster girl..... ^^^^^^^^^^^Iwasneverhere 




 Captain: "Run full speed and just don't think about it"

Crew member: "But captain I don't think..." 

Captain: "Don't think about it"  




 OMG! That's the exact sign from FO3   FO:NV 

EDIT: Just rememberd that Bethesda was the publisher for this game 




 His FB page is still active but as for realeases IDK 









 I don't really know of any albums but have you tried hard trance? :) It's great for zoning out and quite a few of the songs I have heard have a bit of a sci-if feel to them :) check out the song "disarray" by Lisa lashes, Alex kidd   Kidd kaos (be sure to let me know if you need suggestions :D 




 Not exactaly what I'm looking for but thanks for showing me this :) it's got a really nostalgic vibe to it 




 Dose anyone know of any songs that have propaganda samples form WWII or The Cold War?

 You mean Castles in the sky by DJ Satomi? That song is my jam! 









 Ohhhh.... I see what you mean and no I don't think so 




 Man... Qlimax 2006 looked like it was a lot of fun! Who did the anthem for this one?

 Da Tweekaz are incredible!! They make the best euphoric stuff 




 I'm really not trying to be a genre nazi but, Hardcore + DnB = Crossbreed and Breakbeat + Hardcore = Breakcore 




 Also if your looking to get into freeform check out [Alek Szahala](http://youtu.be/uube-JJarcc) 




 Also while he isn't japanese, Shingo DJ/Round Wave Crusher has done a lot of touhou remixes and samples a lot of Hentai/Anime for his songs

[Kobaryo](http://youtu.be/vnc6VykRI7E)

[M1dy](http://youtu.be/DTnHdWA9WTE) 




 Duuuudeee!!! Japanese hard dance is the best! Kobaryo, M-Project and M1dy FTW!! 




 Remember when Prizyms first started posting Hardstyle to the sub? Well it's been a while and I have to ask, how dose everyone feel about hard dance now? I Actually love it more then I ever thought I would! I've been listening to genres I though I would always hate (speedcore and beond)  









 LOVE R.O. Belgian swing was amazing!  




 theirs a art to being a charming ass and Joel nails it  




 "Dike Martians" I guess monstercat's home planet was pretty kinky (   ) 




 He also loves hardstyle 




 Especially so if said artists have done work with noisia! 




 You guys should bug nick to get a reddit account 




 Maby a part for string bass? :D 




 It's awesome knowing that you like bee and puppy cat 

EDIT: what did you think of the first two episodes? 




 All we need is nick and the entirety of evol intent will be here 









 Computer club ILY M8 p.s. The liquid was amazing 3 




 Monstercat should meet a girl monstercat at some point. I think that would be cute 




 Prizymz actually is spinnin' (he dose their cover art) 









 If your not familiar with EVOL Intent, it is a group of three guys (one of those guys being bro safari) who mainly make DnB and have done songs with Noisia and give out a lot of their music for free over soundcloud  




 Your GQ comes with a free car, but you gotta pay tax  




 Ill do my best senpai!!!! (  ) 




 any idea where i can find some good reads on supersaws? :) 




 Dose anyone know of any good patches/tutorials? I have the FL signature bundle and harmor if that helps :) 









 [Downlink and Calvertron - Immortal (F3tch Remix)](http://www.beatport.com/track/immortal-f3tch-remix/5773480)

 









 TFW when you don't have a monstercat to snuggle with 




 Kawaii AF + DnB x nanobii - possible cover art by skrillbug if he chooses to finish this = ()*:	 




 It's one of the songs that got me started on trance  




 Wow that's a good remix! [heres a link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7UVCxcW46Y) to RWC's remix of reach for the moon immortal smoke 




 If your interested you should checkout some of shingo's other thohou remixes, he's done a lot. (He's also remixed a few songs as Round Wave Crusher) 




 I will do the best I can :) 




 Just downloaded Bad Boi   the uncaged remixes. Looking at my Traktor library I'm sitting on a lot of PBN songs, sooo mega mix anyone.... All the PBN songs I have (excluding the one's I can't mix nicely) originals and remixes 




 Not a huge fan of the kick in this one but if you look past it and listen to the melody you will be hooked!!!  









 That sounds awesome!!!! It could be a genre use to classify futile Japan style trance 




 Why can't people just leave the poor guy alone? 




 Plus more money to swery means a better chance of D4 Pt.2 coming out 




 Your pickles come with a free car but you got to pay tax on it 




 Swery should get a reddit account so people can ask him about clam chowder  




 I see him! 
 




 0_0 wow... And I thought Mordor was inhospitable before. This would actually be really cool in the movies though, a place where you are either freezing or super hot, all while being watched by the eye 




 Like pats many little babby yelps could be used for text notifications 

"AH!" Ooo it looks like I got a text 




 Oh wow :( I just got a really sad though in my head... It's of shep. Going into the gun room and seeing one of the those tags hanging from one of the guns and silently weeping because she got the Turian she loved killed 




 Ya up here in Wisconsin it gets down to -10 F at night 




 Come on man learn the lore, everyone knows the Asari evolved from crabs /s 




 you'd probably want WAV. or higher for modding 

EDIT: Actually you could use MP3's it just depends on how well compressed they are 




 I didn't notice the legs until you guys pointed it out.... jeez it looks like Liara was staying in the uncanny valley when this was painted   




 The thumbnail makes it look like shes doing [this](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121209083120/adventuretimewithfinnandjake/images/a/a6/Mckayla_is_Unimpressed.png), Cool shep. though! :D 




 Bring it here bro *opens arms for hugz* 




 I think they would make really cool one shots for DJing 




 I would really like one in red (purple is a sweet color but I've always liked the red hoods better)  




 Oh the fun I will have with this in FL 11 




 Freeform!!!! Check out Alek Szahala  




 You might like freeform :) it's a combination of hardcore and trance. [Check this one out](http://youtu.be/uube-JJarcc) 














 Woa... :0 thanks dude! 




 I've been getting into the genre lately and I was woundering if some one could give me some suggestions :) 




 Actually their all full tracks (with a few edits thrown in) 




 I accidentally deleted my comment with all the songs I linked :I I'll just give them to you and link them later 

Ophidian - Sounds of the machine 

Meander (Ophidian's crossbreed alias) - Greyscale

Angerfist - And Jeasus wept 

Kobaryo - Clock Control 

I:gor - The Devil has a name

Outside Agency - Hours   Dreams

S3rl - Feel the melody  




 Thanks man! 




 In E-force's song seven the tempo goes up at the second climax and then goes back to 150 for the next, dose anyone know what the tempo goes up to? I'm having a hard time figuring it out  




 If you showed him a pic of that he would block you on Twitter  




 Hard Dance: Kobaryo (he's already had a few releases on mob squad but it would be cool to see him bring the gabber sound to MC) 




 All right m7s let's get to know eachother a little better :), I absolutely love hard dance! If you don't know what that is it's stuff like hardcore, hardstyle, hard house, hard trance .etc 




 How did you get out of Skyrim with the war going on? (Torbjrn is the most Skyrimish name I have ever heard) 




 Scary monsters and nice sprites will always have a special place in my heart 




 Lisa lashes v.s Alex Kidd and Kidd Kaos - Dissaray (amazing hard trance) 




 Oh..... OH! Ow  




 During sophomore year (last year) this freshman girl came to school with face paint on. I'm talking full face cheeta patern..... P.S. You sound like a cool girl :) 




 toonie? 




 I remember back in middle school in the wake of COD black ops people would sharpen pencils to a dangerous point and whip them at each other while yelling "Tomahawk!" I think one kid got stuck in the leg with a colored pencil  




 I followed the advice given to me and I have to say I'm happy with how it turned out, I updated the [PP](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-dST9JfmygNvSEaYppJVyBqe36W_bYfXJMalfE6xZjU/edit?usp=sharing) and the [mix](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/hard-dance-lession-update) (this one flows a lot better), I also dropped Breakcore in favor of Tekstyle and I think a certain someone on this sub will be happy with my hardstyle song choice ;) *cough cough* /u/audiofrq     




 I know the pic he's talking about!! Allow me to do some digging 

EDIT: [Found it!](http://25.media.tumblr.com/bb0681713936b617bc3d3ac099dbaee7/tumblr_muqkczkYBi1s0aezvo1_250.png) sorry the image is so small 




 [this](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/skeleton-war)  




 Fuck boy (can't quote right because I'm on mobile), When the skeleton war starts I'm going to find Cameron Dallas and put his head on a pike 




 Have you heard his latest album? One word... Lush 




 we must de-Liam them before the milk goes sour and makes woolie (and anyone really) vomit  




 Where do I sign up?! 




 Woa Jack of sound... on Mcat.... 3 




 The R Is Silent is amazing! great combo of neruo and dubstep 




 Did anyone notice the ships shadow? It was like 20FPS  




 ...will help Liam pay off his vita, ...will help us get Liam out of the vents, ...will help Liam get gud, ...Will help save school girls from Liam (all I got for now)

EDIT: it should cut to Liam holding his vita crying and saying it was worth it surrounded by the 3 games the vita has 




 It would be cool to see this girl do a cover of bad apple 




 Probably ment to say "what the F" but engrish  




 He was trained by a master of CQC 




 0_0 I never knew you were on reddit! Also thank you for answering my question, I think I speak for everyone on here when I say that I can't wait! 




 Thanks! This will help a lot with kick making  




 So in less techinal terms it's the "Punch" at the beginning of the kick? P.s. Thank you :) 




 Sorry for the noobish question but I've been seeing the term a lot and I don't really have a firm grasp on it 




 It would be cool to see more electro from him but I have to say his mid-tempo stuff is my favorite 




 Check that reverse bass! 









 I remember reading some where that ophidian and Sam were working on something together, did anything ever come out of it? 




 If be fine with that especially if we get more songs like mirror mirror 




 Get your sides to send picks (especially of the clam chowder) 




 Yes yes yes yes!!! 




 Me too ^^^^choo^^^^choo 




 Sadly my presentation can only be 10min and putting showtek in there is just me forgetting to put "(older work)" next to them 




 Oh I didn't mean boring in that way, what I meant was if you find that it's becoming a slog or if your getting bored working on a track taking a little video game (or anything else really) break can be refreshing and will inspire/clear your mind 




 Hmmm.. You do have some good points, I'll rework it a bit and see if I can get a better progression out of it. Also before I replaced it with "worth fighting for" the song I had was Accelerate, the reason I changed it was it didn't think it went with all the other songs I have in the mix  




 Same with me but just remember when it starts to get boring a little break can make you feel awesome :) 




 VIDEO GAMES!!!
 




 Hello everyone! you may remember me as the guy who asked for euphoric hardstyle needed in a [mix for a school talent show](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/comments/2itn3g/a_call_to_everyone/), well here's an update. Me and my friend decided to do our own things for the talent show, it was after that I got to thinking "why just show people hardstyle when there's a whole genre of music (Hard Dance) I could expose them too". So after some work I have made a mix and a power point, I'm going to do a live mix while projecting the power point behind me. Each slide will have the genre of the current song, facts and what song is currently playing. This is where you guys come in, [heres a link to the mix](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/hard-dance-lession) [and heres a link to the PP](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-dST9JfmygNvSEaYppJVyBqe36W_bYfXJMalfE6xZjU/edit?usp=sharing), I've made it so you guys can leave notes on the PP in case I got any facts wrong. Thanks in advance :)  




 [Based freq gave a good explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/comments/287r9t/holy_shtball_these_kicks_sound_like_nuclear/ci8ww6v) 




 I searched "kpop hardstyle" 









 He's soo cute 




 [ummmmmm](https://soundcloud.com/djmatduke/matduke-utopia) 




 IDK what arion's been up too and as for GQ he might be working on some music  




 Kai wachi hype! 




 Never never never never compare yourself to your favorite producer/s it never helps the creative process and it will make you feel bad about your self. I'm an aspiring hard dance producer and when ever I think I have a good kick I remember how sweet and amazing ophidians, audiofreqs, zatoxs, angerfists, nosferatus.etc kicks sound and I feel so bad. Take your time, watch some videos (seamlessR FTW) and most importantly have fun because if your not having fun your basically working a day job you payed 600$+ for 




 Link to the space fund plz 




 For those wondering where this is from, in the gal gun video Liam said that plague sent him a link to these. Oh plague senpai... (`) you with your ahegao faces and busty furry girls (still waiting on the fan art of the lizard girls from bug island plague)
