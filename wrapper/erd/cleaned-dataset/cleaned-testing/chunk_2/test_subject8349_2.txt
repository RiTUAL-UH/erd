 The countries with the highest percentages of white people tend to be the most developed and have better quality of life and gender equality. 




 Are you Dick Cheney? 




 I live in Portugal and I've never seen actual snow in real life. Scandinavians are so lucky :/

 And then you found out it was on ThePirateBay? :P 









 The Internet as we now know it. I find it amazing we can send a message to the other side of the world in less than 1 second, store thousands and thousands of photos when we once need countless albums... 




 Visiting London for 6 days with my classmates/friends. It'll be next year, and of course I'm going. 




 Would people in Sweden consider someone white if they have black hair, dark brown eyes and slightly tanned skin? 




 CyberGhost is great as well, and they offer a free version. Premium is worth it, though. 




 Most brands are worth the money unless they're incredibly overpriced (like Apple, for instance). Some generic brands are good enough, but you never have the guarantee you're getting a quality product. Two things from these brands you should avoid are shower gel and toothpaste. 




 If so, tell me a bit about your experience. I'm a newbie that cracks simple programs for entertainment. 




 Ignite.

 Crysis 3. I enjoyed the alpha/beta multiplayer, so I bought the full game. 1st mistake was buying it on a local retail store instead of some online key store. 2nd mistake was buying it at all :) 




 My Portuguese teacher wanted my to help her make a PowerPoint presentation of some poems we were forced to write. I don't get paid anything in the first place, needless to say I refused :) 




 A friend's gameboy, when I was like 5 years old or so. I freaked out when I saw it stopped working. The guarantee wouldn't cover it, so my parents ended up paying either for the repairs or for a new one (can't remember). 




 They saved money on toilet paper to buy all that expensive cool stuff ^^ 




 I didn't win the "genetic lottery" at all. I have dark brown eyes, black hair, big nose, big lips considering that I'm white (or at least I think I am), wide teeth that have gone yellow-ish even though I never had teeth problems and always washed them, and tanned skin. I would love to have light blue eyes, small nose, normal-sized lips, normal white teeth and fair skin. The only thing I like is being tall, actually. 




 No. There are no real movies in 4k yet, many TV channels still broadcast in 720p and the price of a 4k TV is ridiculous. By the time 4k gets popular, they will be 1/2 or 1/3 of their current price. As someone suggested, a 4k monitor might make a difference, though. 4k gaming is great, and a huge monitor can be great if you usually have many windows opened. 




 Wait a day before spending money on something you've just seen and are really excited about. I guarantee that in many cases the "excitement" just goes away and you save some money. 




 I never quite knew how to socialize, specially with people I didn't know. The older ones in the parties always found something to make fun of me, and I was never seen as an equal to other people in the party. 




 Just the way I style it, I guess.

 Every single one from my friends.

 I have this memory of looking up in crib and seeing those crib toys. Probably a fake memory though. 




 Besides of the basic info about yourself, try to memorize the names of new people you just met. If you meet them again, they'll feel nice as they were remembered, and if you need anything from them you're more likely to get it. 




 Gravity. It was so boring and pointless (in my opinion). If there are guys who like it, I recommend checking their testosterone levels. 




 Meeting a tourist girl around my age. I create various scenarios and daydream.   




 I hate them, I'd much rather date a flat chick. Having fake breasts means you're not confident about yourself to the point you wanna "get a masK".
