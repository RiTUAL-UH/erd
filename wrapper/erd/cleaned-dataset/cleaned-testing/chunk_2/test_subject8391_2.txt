 That is one reason that she began to think about it, believe it or not. 




 Unfortunately, she would take this at a sign that she made the right decision... 




 I'm hoping to do exactly that. 














 "Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in Harris Interactive surveys. The data have been weighted to reflect the composition of the adult population. Because the sample is based on those who agreed to participate in the Harris Interactive panel, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated."

 There are actually three glass beaches in Fort Bragg -- The one in  MacKerricher State Park has almost been cleared of all the glass. This appears to be the [1943  1949 dump site which is just south of it](http://www.nationalparksblog.com/sea-glass-beach-fort-bragg-california/).

 




 You know what you are passionate about -- whatever that is, figure out a way to make money at it. I have a friend that spends her entire time looking for seaglass on the beach and making it into jewelry that she sells. by picking something that you truly enjoy, you have a much better chance at success.

 I discovered that cows have really long tongues when I was in Japan and helping out on a dairy farm -- was feeding them in the morning and one decided to wrap its tongue completely around my face while my back was turned and give a good lick. Had nightmares about it for the next month... 














 Actually, Japan uses paper money far more than in the US. When I wasliving in Japan (10 years ago) I was paid in cash each month to the tune of $3000. Almost all homes have a fairly large stash of cash which would have been washed away. Things have changed quite a bit, but the older generation still uses cash almost exclusively. 




 damn, what is that? I lived in Japan for 10 years and never saw anything like that served to me at a sushi bar...

 It's the same problem other search engines have with Google -- why change if you know something works well? The only way they can regain their reputation is not meet what foreign car companies are doing, but surpass them.  




 Thank you. Very much appreciated. 




 I don't know enough about James Wilson or whether this is accurate to respond to this. Part of the problem is she jumps about and talks about a lot more than just the pledge of allegiance. Need some help on the best way to respond to this argument. This was her response after I explained that God was added to the pledge of allegiance in 1954 and explaining the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

"What is been taken away is the freedom to acknowledge God in schools and government arenas ...that was never the intent of the Founding Fathers.....Just because the did not the phrase "under God" until later it does not reflect the original intention. Founding Father, James Wilson, Supreme Court Judge He was appointed by George Washington to the Supreme Court. He served for nine years. 

Signed the Dec. of Ind. And the Constitution His legal lectures (three books) were used in the first organized legal training for law students. You can still get copies of those books. Here is what he said. Law made for men and nations flows from the same divine source the law of God, what we do must be founded on what he has done. The deficiency of our laws must be supplied by the perfections of his. 

Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is Divine. 

In factthe early court made numerous decision defending the Ten Commandments. You were just as likely to find the Ten Commandments hanging in a government building and school, as you were a church. 

Marshall said the Ten Commandments must be fundamental precepts of our civil society 

Quotes from George Washington: 

You do well to wish to learn our arts and ways of life, and above all, the religion of Jesus Christ. These will make you a greater and happier people than you are. 

While we are zealously performing the duties of good citizens and soldiers, we certainly ought not to be inattentive to the higher duties of religion. To the distinguished character of Patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian. The blessing and protection of Heaven are at all times necessary but especially so in times of public distress and danger. The General hopes and trusts that every officer and man will endeavor to live and act as becomes a Christian soldier, defending the dearest rights and liberties of his country. 

I now make it my earnest prayer that God would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice, to love mercy, and to demean ourselves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of the mind which were the characteristics of the Divine Author of our blessed religion."

 I would prefer that you give a donation to the local food bank because I think that will do more good :) 




 It helped me make a decision. I usually fly to LA from SF bay area and rent a car, but I decided to rent a car and spend a day driving down there next month. The cost is about the same (an extra two days of rental car + gas = plane ticket), but it does mean a lot more time - something I am willing to accept to avoid the screening machines. 

Unfortunately, this isn't going to be possible for many of the longer flights that I must take, but I'm hoping if enough people start opting out of shorter flights, the airlines will also start to place pressure on this issue. 









 I have always thought I believed that all human beings are equal. I recently started thinking that I could save someone's life if I were to donate one of my kidneys to someone in need of one. Why is it that I hesitate in doing this because I don't know the person it will go to when I wouldn't hesitate to do the same for someone I know. Does this mean that I really don't believe that all human life is equal?

 It's been completed funded - thanks for bringing it to my attention :) 




 Yes, totally sincere. It is how I live my life. As MrStuff said, most of the atheists I know feel this way and are some of the most generous people I know.

Even a small donations can have a significant impact in this race:

* $10 = 250 voter contacts (phone) 
* $25 = A 4x4 ft. "barn sign" 
* $50 = A 30-second radio ad 
* $100 = 50 yard signs 
* $200 = 2000 lapel stickers 
* $250 = A 30-second spot on non-primetime network TV 
* $500 = 1000 voter contacts (paid canvassing) 
* $1000 = 25,000 voter contacts (phone) 

 




 I am an ultimately selfish person but I show it through generosity and goodwill and humility. 

I believe that good will towards others earns me more happiness than my dominance could. I am an atheist.
 









 I assume it was something [like this](http://www.grocerycouponguide.com/articles/eating-well-on-1-a-day/)? 














 There is a limit to the number of coupons you can print off the Internet which is usually 2 per computer. The more computers you have access to, the more coupons you can print. 




 I think the fact that the government tried to cover it up and outright lied about what happened has a lot to do with it... 




 I just donated in the memory of all those killed in the video. I hope you will all consider doing the same. 
























 Every year as a adsense user, Google sends me a gift. This year this message is what I received with a link to url above:

Hello,

As we near the end of the year, we wanted to take a moment to thank you for the time, energy, commitment, and trust you've shared with us in 2009.

With sharing in mind, this year we've decided to do something a little different. We hope you'll find it fits the spirit of the holiday season. 

We're looking forward to working with you to build lasting success in 2010.

Happy Holidays,
Your Google Team 







































 I often find that the cheapest ticket still ends up being on the airline's site. After using an aggregate search, always go directly to the airline site that was the least expensive. You'll likely get the same ticket there for less. The aggregate sites just allow you to save time from going to every airline site one by one.

 OK, then explain why I'm living in Japan because my husband needed heart surgery which cost $2000 here but would have cost $25,000 in the US? The standard of living in Japan is not much lower than in the US. 














 Good - then the media are free to ask her tough and detailed energy questions and there can be no excuse if she can't answer them - she has now been billed as the top energy expert
