the local community of the wadi they confirmed that wadi Gaza used to flow
regularly during the winter season for at least two months and used to bring
huge amounts of water.
Since the early seventies this amount of water started to decrease considerably
due to the built up of [check dams](http://www.appropedia.org/Check_dam) and diversion schemes by Israel on the upper
course of the Wadi (Photo.., Annex 3). 
Since then the volume and duration of flow has decreased much with some
occasional flash floods sweeping down the Wadi bed at wet years.

Their website says  that the video was purchased from University of South Carolina Newsfilm Library in Columbia, South Carolina in April 1992. 

Acquisition Notes:
The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum purchased this from University of South Carolina Newsfilm Library in Columbia, South Carolina in April 1992. The footage was obtained as research for the Museum's Permanent Exhibition.

Notes:

This clip is also on Film ID 235. Film IDs 235 and 236 have the same time codes. Film ID 235 contains more stories than Film ID 236, but the USHMM only has a VHS copy of Film ID 235.


The big question is if Film ID 235 is in this video (Film 237) or there's more footage. 




 [FBI Press Release](http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/reward-announced-for-cyber-fugitive) 




 A check dam doesn't have gates that can be opened. It's a small fixed barrier which reduces the water flow velocity in order for the water to be diverted.

[Read this study](http://vinc.s.free.fr/IMG/palsd_hydro-2.pdf) on Wadi Gaza Wetland Area from [The Mediterranean Wetlands Initiative](http://medwet.org/aboutmedwet/)   




 There are no dams, only [check dams](http://www.appropedia.org/Check_dam)  and diversions. The diversions and check dams actually mitigate flooding in Wadi Gaza.

 and then fill a bucket and hold your head underneath, 

As much as you'd like to think so, the truth is Israel is not in-control of rainfall

The real question is, what is happening in the rest of the area under Israeli water control? Have any Jewish-majority areas in Israel been evacuated because of floods? Any West Bank settlements? These aren't rhetorical questions, I really don't know and you seem to have access to reliable sources.

http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4629185,00.html

"Around 2pm, Southern Police's Negev Mountains rescue unit was called up to help two civilians whose car was stuck in a flood in HaBesor Stream on Route 222."

"Police closed Route 222 and other roads in the area and urged the public not to try to cross Vadis and running streams, even if it seems passable."
 
"Meanwhile, residents of Ein Gedi, Neot HaKikar and Ein Tamar have been stuck in their homes for two days now after flooding in streams in the area led to the closure of Highway 90."

 









 I brought proof that before Israel diverted water into farming and reserves, the Wadi Gaza used to overflow during every winter, bring huge amounts of rainwater and disturb the transportation between the northern and southern parts of the Gaza Strip.  Israels diversion of the watercourse is mitigating the flooding.

It's logical to assume that harsh weather could bring on same conditions as was before the diversion.

 OMG there are no israeli towns flooded and no Israeli farms flooded over the last 12 hours

Wrong. 

http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4629185,00.html

"Meanwhile, residents of Ein Gedi, Neot HaKikar and Ein Tamar have been stuck in their homes for two days now after flooding in streams in the area led to the closure of Highway 90."

"Two civilians whose vehicle got stuck in the flooding from HaBesor Stream in southern Israel found themselves in need of assistance from an IAF helicopter and police divers on Saturday"

"We hope there isn't an emergency because we can't get out," Shahaf Homeri from Ein Gedi said. "The Arugot Stream is completely flooded. All of the streams south of here - Hever Stream and Tze'elim Stream - are flowing in a raging torrent and there's no way we could cross them. We're stuck from north and south, we can't go anywhere. It's just like we're on an island, you can't get to us." 




 [Wadi Gaza](http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en lat=31.321821 lon=34.490461 z=15 m=b show=/31088593/) is a wetland that has a potential to store the volume of more than 100,000 m3 of surface water.

 It is historically known to overflow during the winter, disturbing the transportation between the northern and southern parts of the Gaza Strip. Before Israel diverted some of the water into farming and reserves the Wadi Gaza used to overflow during every winter and bring huge amounts of rainwater. Now after the diversion the flooding is only after a big storm due to natural causes.


"Wadi Gaza wetland pond acts as important surface water storage reservoir, it
has the potential to store a volume of more than 100, 000 m3 of surface water."

Could flooding possibly be because Hamas won't build proper infrastructure? 




 It came from the same place the flooding did till the late sixties 

 




 Where is the proof there was any release at dams? The flooding was caused by excessive rain.  




 The diversion is mitigating the flooding.

 If a nation takes all the water of a watercourse and then releases mass amounts into a dry water way in times of heavy rains it must take proactive steps to prevent damage to other nations.

For the third time, where is the proof Israel released any extra water in to the watercourse? 

Before Israel diverted some of the water into farming and reserves the Wadi Gaza used to overflow during every winter and bring huge amounts of rainwater. Now the flooding is only after a big storm due to natural causes.

"Article 7 makes clear that the "no-harm rule"..

Not only is Israel not violating the "no-harm rule", the diversion is mitigating the flooding.

First they blame Israel for diverting their natural resources and creating a shortage of water. Then, when it  rains an abundant amount of water in a short period of time and the Wadi naturally overflows, Israel is blamed for flooding. Logical?

The BRA had in mind a $30 million program to reverse the structural decline of the aging South Boston neighborhood, just across the channel on the south side of the city, under the heading of "General Neighborhood Renewal Plan". Estimating the some 47 percent of the district's housing stock was badly in need of repair or demolition, especially in the lower end, the plan called for 22 percent of the housing to be torn down, some new housing constructed, and the remaining dwelling units rehabilitated...
Signs exclaiming "To Hell with Urban Renewal" went up all over the neighborhood as residents engaged in picketing, sit-ins, and public demonstration, determined to hold on to their homes until they were "driven out by force".

 The BRA had in mind a $30 million program to  reverse the structural decline of the aging South Boston neighborhood, just across the channel on the south side of the city, under the heading of "General Neighborhood Renewal Plan". Estimating the some 47 percent of the district's housing stock was badly in need of repair or demolition, especially in the lower end, the plan called for 22 percent of the housing to be torn down, some new housing constructed, and the remaining dwelling units rehabilitated...

Signs exclaiming "To Hell with Urban Renewal" went up all over the neighborhood as residents engaged in picketing, sit-ins, and public demonstration, determined to hold on to their until they were "driven out by force".

 I found the missing pilot in the December 23, 1943 [Aircraft Action Report] (http://imgur.com/7kxWDC7,jorNfTW,upyKYiy,Svesq9E) (4 pages).

It was a F4U-1 like you said not a F4U-1D.

My [source](https://books.google.com/books?id=nV1IAwAAQBAJ pg=PA394 lpg=PA394 dq=F4U+12/25/43 source=bl ots=U9yOOfhg1G sig=NWuahXkkGVxs-IIM4bzmb4fSeVE hl=en sa=X ei=dzvlVNveKoOXNtingdgK ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage q=F4U%2012%2F25%2F43 f=false) is incorrect. 
  




  Corsairs were in the Pacific in 1943, but not F4U-1Ds

On [12/25/**1943**](https://books.google.com/books?id=nV1IAwAAQBAJ pg=PA394 lpg=PA394 dq=F4U+12/25/43 source=bl ots=U9yOOfhg1G sig=NWuahXkkGVxs-IIM4bzmb4fSeVE hl=en sa=X ei=dzvlVNveKoOXNtingdgK ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage q=F4U%2012%2F25%2F43 f=false) a F4U-1D based in Vella Lavella went missing.

So yes, F4U-1Ds were in the Pacific in 1943.
 




 EDIT: I should also mention that this would have been taken in 1945 most likely, or perhaps very late 1944, but definitely not 1943.

EDIT 2: I should also note that the US Army Air Force did not use Corsairs, so this is either a Navy or Marine aircraft, as they were the American users of the type.

You are wrong on *Edit:[the first] (both) assumption(s).

In February 1943 the [307th Operation Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/307th_Operations_Group) of the United States Air Force was assigned to the Thirteenth Air Force and stationed to Solomon Island in the Pacific.
Navy Corsairs were assigned as fighter escort for Air Force B-24 bombers belonging to the 307th Bomb Group.

 Very misleading. Material non-lethal aid not Military aid. 




 The Hoover Dam was actually the first construction site to mandate hard hats on the job.

The Las Vegas Review Journal -  October 28, 1931
 
Nobody will be allowed in the canyon bottom without one of the helmets, henceforth, according to Ed Brockman, supervisor of insurance and safety for the Big Six. 

"And Six Companies is paying the bill.  A helmet for every man!  And more than fifty dozen already have been issued.  Others are en route from the factory, enough to protect the craniums of the army in its entirety.

I guess it was 
"A helmet for every man!"
except politicians...  




 It sure took a lot more then two workers to build those penstock steel pipes.

 In 2013, 12 year-old girl [**Naomi Kutin**](https://www.google.com/#q=naomi+kutin+weightlifting+)  was in the news for lifting 231 pounds and setting the All-time World Record (again) for the Raw Squat for the Women's 97 pound weight class.

If you only look at the weight difference, **Patricia O'Keefe** would hold the world record for greatest ratio.
