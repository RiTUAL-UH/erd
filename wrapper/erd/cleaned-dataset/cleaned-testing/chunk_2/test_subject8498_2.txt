 That's a very interesting phenomenon. I always wondered if this [House MD experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbE2ch-9ZFc)  (S6 mild spoilers) would work in real life.

 *And the gold medal goes to gravity!* 




 Interestingly enough, here in my country it's against the law to cheat if you're married. You theoretically could go to jail because of it. 

And I say theoretically because you could fucking murder someone here and be out the next day.

  You're saying that people who experienced unwanted sexual contact weren't raped because three decades later they don't roll into the fetal position and cry any time a joke is made that vaguely resembles their trauma.

Yeah, no. I'm pretty sure that's real fucking far from what I said.    

 




 Why is it that in so many of these irrational decisions stories this guy name's comes up?

 Slightly unrelated question: I've seen videos of people sneaking behind enemies and slaying their throats with daggers, but I couldn't find the perk to do this. Is it in a mod, or am I missing something far more obvious?

 Ahhh, I see know. I always thought "charge" was refering to "ammount of energy", huge mistake. In what parameters we define charge? Do we have units for measuring it? And, if you had to ELI5 the definition of charge, what would it be?

Thanks so much for your answers! 




 What do we mean when we talk about positive and negative charges, such as in protons and electrons? How is there a negative value for energy? 




 Exactly, remember that smaller and bigger stars than the Sun can host planets where life could exist. They're just at a different distance. 




 I read once here on Reddit that diabetic people are told to inyect water on oranges so they can practice before inyecting themselves with insulin, and one time a doctor/nurse saw a person with this disease on the ER with ridiculous high sugar levels on their blood.        

They were inyecting the oranges with the insulin and then eating them. 




 Hey, congratulations! Keep consistency and I wish to you the best of successes :)

 You're refering to the guy moving on the background at 4:04? I just noticed it, what is that? 




 In all seriousness, who in their right minds would tattoo this to someone? I mean, money is cool and shit, but there are limits, man... It's pretty obvious that this girl isn't the sharpest tool in the box, why would you agree to tattoo her insanity? It's just fucked up.

 The state holds them (properties and money) until they're 18. 









 Yes. In my district, there is a "consejal" (I'm sorry, I wouldn't know how to name this position in english, it's a helper and a votant on the choices our mayor takes) that's currently 18, but has been since the age of 16.

It's nepotism (mayor's son) and utterly corruption, but almost nothing isn't it anymore around here. 




 I could own a house, and drive a car when I was 16 in Canada...
16 is when you get your G1... sure you need someone in the car with you but you can drive one.. and there is no legal age limit on how old someone has to be to own a house.. a 2 year old could own a house if their parents put it in their name.

None of those things are legal here (Argentina). 




 Voy a escribir en espaol ya que el ingls soy malo

 




 In my country, the legal voting age is 16, and you can vote even for presidential elections. I mean, you can't own a house, drive a car, or decide if you want to drink a beer, but you get to participate in the election of politicians. It's fucked up.

 I installed "DSLR Remote" (Android), it has multiple brands of cameras and a few cool functions. 




 I was trying to fix my IR remote for my Nikon D90, with no luck. I remembered I had some radios and a cable, which I used as a remote shooter in the past, but the cable was broken and I was beggining to feel defeated.    

Then I thought that maybe my S4 Mini had a IR transmitter, and searched for an app. Found one, installed it, and thought "this won't work, I'm sure". Great was my surprise when it actually worked PERFECTLY! I now have a remote IR shooter on my smartphone. I should've realised earlier, but well. Maybe my post helps someone in a similar situation, it's super useful and pretty cool as well.

 Could it be that they are accounting only pure water? As in H2O only. I'm blindly saying this as a chance, I don't know how much of our seas are impurities and how much is actually pure water. 




 What an incredible, gorgeous movie. I'm so glad Nolan picked up so many things from it for Interstellar. In the slight chance that someone in this subreddit doesn't know where that quote is from, it's from Contact, a film from 1997. 




 I just wanted to chip in and say that after a very intense (and arguably irresponsible) salvia trip that led me to a very similar state like OP's, I did exactly this and got better in no time. Depression kicks A LOT stronger when you aren't completely sober. As this commenter says, stay it for a while. Keeping active, forcing yourself to go out and do activities helps a lot. It's hard at first but it does help.
   
I started meditating a few days ago and I'm really enjoying it, so I recommend you OP check it out too. I don't know if it's for everybody, but I did think it wasn't for me, and I'm glad I was wrong. Look it up, it's super simple, and it may help you calm down and stay more focused.

 Thanks so much! I'm definitely going to watch this video. 




 So, I've been having some issues lately that gave me some panic attacks and constant fear, and last night my fear "peaked" and I was very paranoid about very very stupid things.    

I've been thinking about meditating for some time now, and lurked this subreddit and read a bunch of the top posts to get good info on how to do it. I started today, feeling very down, seeing very desaturated colors, and with some fear still in my heart.   

I sat in a towel, with my legs crossed, and the tip of my thumbs touching (I did as described on the #1 top post here). I concentrated on my breathing after puting the alarm for 10 minutes, and started focusing. At first, lots of thoughts came by, that meditation wasn't for me, that it will accomplish nothing, etc etc, but as I read, I contemplated the thoughts and let them flow and pass by.       
          
Later, I began to relax, and to feel good. I could see my problems with a lot of perspective, and they started to feel very solvable. This brought a smile and a feeling of happiness. Over the course of those 10 minutes, I relaxed and reached a very clear mental status. I'm now totally and utterly astonished about my experience. It served me in a great deal, and although I know this is the first step of many, just doing it makes me feel great.

I look foward to do this again tomorrow, and the day after that. And the day after that as well. I have a trip in 2 weeks, in which I'm hoping to practice this as well.          

It was beautiful and very helpful, and I wished to share that with you. Of course any tips or advice are very well welcomed.  
   
Thanks for reading :)
