 Same boat as you my friend (although i only bruised the top of my foot)
life will get better for us average Joe's  




 Hey Ross, 
First up, you're my fav with all the delicious puns and such,
and if you had to stick playing one video game for the rest of your life,
What game would that be? 









 My best guess would be a sever migraine, They have many ways to suppress them if they become more frequent, but usualy a acute migrane (as you described) can take over your whole day, feel better buddy
