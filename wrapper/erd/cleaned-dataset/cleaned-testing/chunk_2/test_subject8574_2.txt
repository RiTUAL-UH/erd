 Wait... the smiling man is a Let's not meet post? My day just got a whole lot more sleepless... Fuck. 




 I actually just looked it up. I feel like an idiot... Thank you though. Criticism isn't something to take as an insult, but an opportunity to learn. :]        




 I will admit, I ain't really good at grammar and such. I tried my best but I'll keep working on my writing skill. I'm looking up the words you gave me. Either my teacher's never taught me that in school, or I forgot. I wasn't a good learner in school. But I'll work on it for sure. 




 Ya, I'm trying to get better with my grammar and such. Sorry about that. Though, I'm glad you found it interesting. Fun fact: Never have eaten a cake after that. NEVER AGAIN. 




 For the past five or so week's my throat has been having this itch. It started out simple enough. 
Ironically, it happened on my birthday. My mom, dad, little brother, big sister, and her two kids were there. 
The cake was very beautiful. Icing roses, and amazing artwork by my sister made with some gooey candy stuff that I can't quite remember the name of. 
A little card, kind of like the one you would get from a business place with contact info on it, seated itself atop the cake with the writing "Happy Birthday!" It was a good day. 
One of my nephews was whacking around a foam sword, unintentionally breaking three of the most expensive things in my house. 
I joked with my sister that we should keep a tally on how many things would be in pieces before the day would end. 
She laughed and turned to face me. 
Because of this, she didn't see my nephew coming full force with his foam sword. 
Splat, the cake was mushed to a pulp. My sister scolded her son for a second. 
She then took away the foam swords and apologized. 
I told her it was nothing. She gave me a look and fixed her eyes on the cake. "It's still good" I said. 
I then proceeded to convince her along with the rest of the family that this was the case. 
After all, it would be a bitch to fix up another one. And, I honestly didn't think I deserved that much treatment. That was the reason I convinced them it was fine; the cake was still good. 

When all was good and done, I said my good bye's to my family before they went home. 
I was in good spirits, I didn't even notice that little tickle in my throat. 
It wasn't until I was laying silent in bed, moon looming over me. Swallowing, I felt this strange tingle of pain. 
I got some water, and then the pain seemed to settle. over the course of two days, it got worse. 
It wasn't pain this time, it was a tickle. After the third day, I just couldn't concentrate on anything. 
Because of this, I decided to see a Doctor. I thought of a bunch of thing's this tickle could possibly be. 
A sexual disease, flu, my smoking catching up with me, and loads more. 
If your curios about the first one, I just started dating this wonderful girl. You never know. Let's move on. 
The Doctor thought nothing of it when i told him how it felt. He "diagnosed" that I had a sore throat, or an allergy. I took what he had said as the truth. No reason to worry, right? 
It wasn't really hurting at this point, so I couldn't say other wise. 
Well, unfortunately, it turned back into a sore throat a day later. 
I decided to call in sick, my throat bothered me enough to do so. 
With enough sleep and a healthy dose of water, I would get over this I thought. 
I had no idea how bad things would escalate.

That same god damn tickle turned into an itch. Sooner or later I started to scratch the outside of my neck. 
Then, inside my throat as well. It wasn't like before where I would swallow constantly to stop the pain. 
This time I used my nail's to sooth the pain in my throat. My neck for some weird reason became more of a problem as time went on as well. I started scratching a lot there too. Without even thinking, I started to scratch. 
When the pain would engulf my throat and neck, I would scratch. 
Later on, If I wasn't scratching, I could feel the pain. Over a short period of time this itch got out of hand. 
The pain kept getting severe, and more so as time went on. I kept scratching. 
From then on, the blind's remained closed since the light from outside started to hurt my eyes. 
With the blinds closed, it hurt less to see. Funny enough though, with the blinds closed I could barely see. 
I was okay with it though. I always preferred the dark anyway.  

After awhile, I started getting call's from work after four days of being absent; I stopped answering them. 
After three week's of this itch, I was kinda loopy. I knew this wasn't normal, something was going on. 
The problem with knowing something's wrong is when you don't quite know what that problem is. 
A day literally felt like a week. 
In the back of my mind, I even started to think that a ghost or a demon was behind this. 
I never thought that was the issue, though it was hard trying to keep it out of mind. Soon, it got hard to talk. 
At one point, I almost felt as if i couldn't say a word without pain rushing behind my sentences. 
My throat was completely void of any moisture. 
Truthfully, I didn't think it was as bad as it was, despite knowing this was not your normal sore throat. 
In my head, my logical calm self was in charge. 
It said "Mike, you should really see a doctor soon and get back to your boss about this." 
I was worried, but not as much as I should have been.

After some debate in my head, I decided to call the doctor to schedule another appointment. 
My head started to feel clouded, and I couldn't think straight without mustering enough mentality to do so. 
My hand reached for my cell, it was charging in front of the alarm clock. God, when was the last time I used it? 
I stopped as my hand touched the phone. Something looked off. 
I didn't notice it at first, and I cannot comprehend how I didn't notice sooner. 
How often I was scratching, all I did was sleep, thought's seeming cloudy, thinking it was just the same pain I had in my throat from the very start. I had blood on my fingers. 
I tried to yell out "Jesus Christ!", but it was so painful I couldn't bear one letter. 
If the light from the alarm clock didn't alert me when I went to grab my phone, I don't know how much longer that stained hand would have gone unnoticed. 
Despite the major headache that ensued from getting up too quickly, I opened the blinds. 
The Light felt like a literal stab in the eyes. I didn't let that stop me from turning around to check my bed. 
I couldn't tell that there was a nice big blotch of blood on my bed, my vision was way to impaired too. 
I just stood there until I could see exactly what I suspected to see. 
The only thing that scared me is it was a little bigger than I first thought. 
I looked down afterwards to see a puddle forming in front of me. 
I shoved my fingers down my throat to where I had been scratching. There was an indent. I felt my neck. There was a slight, shallow indent. And from what I could see, a whole lot of blood. Things started to blur. 

I was absolutely terrified.

I started to black out, so I tried to reach for my phone to call 911. 
I tripped, and landed with my face leaning against the bed. 
I tried my best to get up, yet due to my blood loss I kept fumbling over and over again. 
I really thought I was going to die right there. 
Although, my will power, or instinct, whatever you call it, came over me and I forced myself up. 
My vision was literally coming in and out as I stumbled over my bed. It felt kinda like slow motion. 
That's the best way I could describe it. 
Sounds a little dramatic, but I wasn't scared anymore; I was trying to survive. 
I finally got to my phone and then attempted to dial 911. 
I don't remember if I got it wrong once or twice, just that I wanted to cry when I messed up. 

Finally, the ring. *ring* *ring* *ri-* "Hello, this is 911, what's your emergency?" 

I felt so woozy as I tried to speak. When I finally did mange to focus enough to speak, I couldn't. 
My throat, my fucking throat hurt so immensely that I couldn't even say a word. I was dying, I could feel it. 
Once again, I was scared. I then screamed in my mind "Your gonna die, so just yell. Yell as hard as you can." 
I slammed the phone on the counter, Then I yelled at the top of my lungs. 
It was the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life. After that last desperate call for help, nothing, black.

I woke up in a hospital bed, light hurting my eyes. My family wasn't there yet. 
I looked around until I saw a doctor walking towards me, he wanted to make sure I was looking fine and stable. 
He then explained everything that happened to me. how lucky I was to be alive, my family should be here soon, the condition I was is, and the surgical process they went through. 

You want to hear the funny part of this story? 

During surgery, they removed a certain something from my throat. 

It was a small, cardboard like paper. You know the one's they give to you at business places with their contact info and all that? It was like that. There was also something written on it.

"HAPPY BIRTHDAY!"
 




 Honestly, I haven't seen him in a few days. I'll keep you posted. 




 Honestly... I agree with this. Damn, guess i gotta start being a bit more nice... 




 My apologies. As you read, I wrote this late at night. I was really tired and posted this once I thought I proof read it as much as I needed too. Oh dear god was I wrong. I'm in the middle of editing it now, so soon it can be legible. Thank you for being honest. criticism isn't something to take as an insult, but as a lesson to be learned. Thank you, friend. :]
