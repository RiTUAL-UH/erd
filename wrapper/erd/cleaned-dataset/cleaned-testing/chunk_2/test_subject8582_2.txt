 This is more than a disgrace, it's a bit disappointing factually.  




 Clifford is out of character but not bloodlusted.  














 Destoroyah has been killed, but Godzilla is still going to melt down. Can Elsa freeze him and save the Earth? If not, can she do it with the help of:

Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)

Articuno (Pokemon)

Kyurem (Pokemon)

Frozone (The Incredibles)

Iceman (X-Men) 









 1) in-character

2) out-of-character

3) completely bloodlusted

Bonus: what lantern ring would he use and who could he beat then? 



















 Who can use the most powerful thing in the universe -rock and roll- to its fullest?  




 Aside from the original version and the English translation, what are your favorite versions of the song? I have 8 on my phone and I hunger for more. 

edit: i only just now realized I typed the title like a lolcat.  









 As proven by Ramiel's AT field being broken by the Positron Sniper Rifle, AT field's aren't infallible to non-Lance of Longinus weapons. So who's the weakest can break one? 









 Who's the strongest these fusions could beat, and who could beat them?

Godzilla and Mothra- Mothrilla

King Ghidorah and Godzilla- Godzorah

Gidorah and Gigan- Gigorah

Gorosaurus and Zilla (Godzilla 98)- GINOsaurus 
























 [Bulbapedia entry on Victini](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Victini_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29)

The Victini I will be using in this battle, however, has some improvements. In one hand it is using Excalibur, and in the other it wields the Lance of Longinus (the Bible one). It is also being watched over by its patron god, Nike. To top it off, this Victini is wearing a brand new set of plot armor. With all this on it, who can still bring it down? 




 1: Mothra vs the male M.U.T.O.

2: Rodan vs the male M.U.T.O.

3: Mothra vs the female M.U.T.O.

4: Rodan vs the female M.U.T.O.

5: 2v2 tag team match

If any of the rounds is too one-sided, the weaker monster gets to call in their partner 




 Groudon, legendary pokemon of the continents, has been captured by Brendan. When he is, he creates an earthquake which awakens the King of the Monsters, Godzilla. Groudon is as powerful as it can be when it confronts Godzilla. Assume Groudon is playing by anime rules, meaning it isn't bound by EVs, IVs, four move slots, or level.  














 Is there a legendary responsible for the randomness of the universe?

I've been breeding Espurrs for literally months now. I have boxes and boxes full of Espurrs and I still don't have a shiny. Who do I turn to now?  




 Shinji's Angels attack Daten City in the order of their numbering in the show (starting with Sachiel because we haven't seen any non-impact feats from the first two), Panty and Stocking get a week in between each attack to recover. 

EDIT: Stocking's katanas now have the ability to cut through AT fields like beast Unit-02 in 2.22. This means that they can break the AT fields, but she will struggle with stronger ones.  




 I like most of the cross explosions in the rebuilds when the angels die, or the angels use an attack, or really anything happens to the angels. I want a wallpaper (preferably 1366x768) of one of them, but all I can find is Sachiel's death. Do you guys have any other ones? 









 Craig Boone, badass sniper of the wastes, is given a job to kill the Dark Knight. 

Boone gets 7 days of prep time. Batman has an anonymous tip that someone will try to kill him, but not where, when, or how. 

BONUS: no morals Batman vs a deathclaw.  




 Two items enchanted to guarantee victory. They are pitted against each other, what happens? 




 By my count there are 5.25 Saiyans in the universe: Vetega, Goku, Tarble (100% Saiyan), Gohan, Goten, Trunks, Bulla (50% Saiyans, 2 Saiyans total) and Pan (.25 saiyans) are there any i missed who are still alive when Goku flies off to train Uub? 
























 Gigan has decided to attack Tokyo-3 because he's Gigan and he does what he *wants*. SEELE decides that this is the time to send in the Mass-production Evangelion units. He fights them one-on-one, and if he can defeat them he then fights the real Evas. First Unit-00, then unit-02, and finally unit-01. Gigan has his quad-chainsaw armor and between fights he can rest and heal.  









 [The tardigrade](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade)

One of these has been mutated to the size of 100 meters, with all its existing powers scaled up. In addition, it also has the ability to breathe radiation (think Godzilla's atomic breath) if it absorbs enough before firing. The fight will take place in one of three places:

1: A Forest, with the pond that the Tardigrade originated in. It is not near any towns, but there are wildlife and people there if your character still has morals. 

2: Tokyo. Come on, it's a giant monster, how is it *not* going to attack Tokyo? The fight will begin at 4pm Tokyo time. This is real-world Tokyo, so they don't have Mechagodzilla or any variation thereof. 

3: The ISS. Combatants will have to bounce off of space debris to attack, as well as contending with Newton's third law.  




 [this video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=SUamHEvVQy0)

Based on Unit-01's height and the speed at which the wheels are turning, how fast is the bike? 
























 I love Army of Darkness and I want to know how to say it. It's as simple as that. I suppose *baby* could be swapped out for any regional slang for a loved one.  









 Both cryomancers are attempting to stop Mothra who is attacking the city they're in because someone kidnapped the Shojibin. Again. So, they decide to try and freeze her so she'll stop destroying the city. Through teamwork, will they be able to bring down Mothra without killing her, will they have to use excessive force, or will they just fail. 

Bonus: how many Elsa's would be needed to cool down Burning Godzilla from Godzilla vs Destoroyah? 




 I like that shot where they're hugging and amir is in Annette, but I'm a loser and a Jew who can't edit worth shit. Can one of you coy divas make it for me? 




 The fight takes place in Tokyo. An army of Liberty Primes are marching to spread freedom to their mecha brothers, who are deployed in an effort to stop them. All the Mecha-Gs are deployed at once, how many Liberty Primes are needed before the Mecha-Gs are overwhelmed? 




 Lex Luthor kidnaps the Cosmos (like every other greedy businessman), and so Mothra does what she always does and tears apart Metropolis to save her fairies. Because she's tearing apart the city, Superman has come to stop her. 

I think that Mothra would win because she has magic, but my friend think Supes would win.  




 Sephiroth replaces Kaworu as the white-haired Lilim body containing the soul of Adam and fifth child. He waits until the MP-Evas are completed to try to break into Terminal Dogma. Because of convenience, Unit-00 is also fully repaired and Asuka can pilot again. Because his soul is Adam, Sephiroth can cast an AT-field. This is his one-winged form from ACC, not his Safir form from FFVII.  




 Is his body of Adam? I know he has Adam's soul and is therefore an Angeru, but is his body that of a Lilim or a child of Adam with a human-like form? 









 I did a report on origin stories from different cultures (I.e. Not Big Bang or Judeo-Christian Genesis) and my teacher let me use the Arceus creation story. So thank you for helping me with actual things in my real life. Praise Arceus! 




 As in a game focusing solely on Mothra herself (and probably also Leo). What kind of gameplay would you want while controlling her? How many forced karaoke sections with the Cosmos would you want?  




 Something went wrong with SEELE's Dead Sea Scrolls. Ramiel (the 5th angel in NGE, 6th in 1.11) and Leliel (12th Angel in NGE, the black and white orb that ate unit 01) end up in Tokyo-3 at the same time. Baffled, their only option is to battle it out.  




 Let's assume Jesus is willing to kill if he seems it necessary.  




 Nigguh wut the fuk 









 The fight takes place in Steelport, and the Boss has the Iron Saint suit and has upgraded his/her powers to the maximum.  





























 The MP-Eva gets the sword/spear of Longinus replica and nothing else. It does not start out with knowledge of how to kill a Titan. Titan Shifters are included and all the Titans are working together. The Titans have access to the real Lance of Longinus but would need to retrieve it from Terminal Dogma. The fight takes place inside the Geofront.  




 The American military as portrayed in games like Battlefield, Call of Duty, and Medal of Honor, have been convinced that Dr. Doom is a brown person who speaks foreign, so they invade Latveria. Both armies get a week of prep time before the invasion.  




 From what I can tell, all the Evangelion related merchandise is either the Eva's themselves or Asuka/Rei/Mari in suggestive poses. But is there anything with the Lance? It's one of my favorite things from Evangelion and I haven't seen anything of it except for one with half-naked Rei.  
























 I really want to play an Evangelion game but I've heard they're pretty bad. Is there a good one or am I better off modding an Eva into a game I already own? 




 Both get all their equipment maxed out. The fight takes place in DOOM's depiction of Hell. Who wins?  




 Mothra discovers that she can grow into a Titan version of herself and grow by 1000%. As a Titan, she has an increased healing factor and is only vulnerable in the nape of her neck (which I guess is right below the skull for her), which is where her original body is located. She also gets the crystallization thing that the Female Titan did. 

At the same time, Godzilla discovers that he's part Saiyan (somehow) and can become a super saiyan. In this state, he is 50X more powerful in every regard and drains energy quicker. 


Being the Kaiju they are, the have no choice but to use their newfound powers and do battle in Tokyo.  









 I have an HP Pavilion DV6-6b47dx and I want to upgrade the APU to an AMD A10 because it's cheaper than building a whole new PC for gaming. Can I do it or do I just need to get a real PC? 



















 Round 1: no weapons

Round 2: Gypsy gets all the equipped weapons, Unit-01 gets the knife thing, one of the huge gun Shinji used against the fourth Angel, and access to (but not starting with) the Lance of Longinus. 

Both fights take place in Neo-Tokyo.  




 Round 1: A rock-off between the two bands. 

Round 2: A battle between them based on feats and abilities from their songs. 

Round 3: NSP take the place of Tenacious D during the Pick of Destiny movie. Can they retrieve the Pick and defeat Satan? 




 The first round is a fight, taking place in a colosseum. Ash gets his Chainsaw, robot hand, and Boomstick. RMWAS gets what he keeps on him. 

Round 2 has RMWAS take Ash's place in Army of Darkness after Ash already misspoke the words and awoke the army of the dead. He doesn't get the things in the Oldsmobile, but does get his normal gear. Can he defeat evil Ash and protect the Necronomicon?  




 My perfect fighter is as follows: 

Begin with Godzilla. All the feats and abilities of every Godzilla combined. Next, add in the wings of Mothra, scaled appropriately. Add in Saiyan DNA and have him be trained by Goku and Vegeta. He has the ability to become SSJ3 maximum. He also absorbs Kryptonian DNA and gets all Superman's powers. He gains the mind of Rational Man With a Shotgun and invests in Wayne Enterprises, making him the richest monster alive. He somehow becomes a Titan Shifter and the Dragonborn, gaining all abilities related to that, once again scaled up (about 750%). He gains scaled up Sonic's legs and ability to transform, then gains 400 rings and the Super Emeralds (meaning he's Hyper Sonic now). His biggest Form now pilots a scaled up Evangelion Unit-01, wielding a scaled-up Lance of Longinus. His Evangelion now has all his powers because of reasons. His bones and his Evangelion are made of Adamantium.  He gains Martian Manhunter's psychic abilities and is trained by him. 

Who can he beat? 









 Dragon Ball Z's Android 17 and Android 18 face off against OG Mechagodzilla, Moguera, and Kiryu. First, 17 vs each Mechagodzilla, gauntlet-style. Then 18 runs the gauntlet. If they don't win either, they fight the same gauntlet together.  




 [Zilla](http://godzilla.wikia.com/wiki/Zilla) (not real Godzilla, the one from the 1998 movie) gets dropped into Jurassic Park during the events of the first movie right after the outbreak, meaning Jeff Goldblum and Samuel L. Jackson are still there. 

Round 1: Victory is earned by becoming recognized Queen of the Dinosaurs (to stick it to *real* Godzilla). 

Round 2: Victory is earned by not becoming Queen, but her species maintaining a presence on the island living alongside all the other dinosaurs (to pretend she has nothing to do with *real* Godzilla). 

Round 3: She, and only she, must murder every creature on the island. No kids, just murder. No presence, just murder.  




 To the death/regeneration. The Doctor is Tennant and gets everything he usually carries. 

My friend thinks the Terminator would win and I think he's full of shit.  









 Elsa #1 is taken from Arendelle after the death of her parent and trained by Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat) for three years until Coronation day. 

Elsa #2 is taken at the same time to Charles Xavier's School for the gifted from X-Men, where she trains her powers for three years and also probably bangs Iceman.  

When the time comes that they must be crowned Queen, they end up going to the same Arendelle through some multiverse mistake, and decide the only logical choice is a fight it out. 

Bonus: Sub-Zero vs Charles Xavier at singing "Let it Go".  




 Everyone, ever, is entered into the next Mortal Kombat tournament. After every round, the winner MUST perform their fatality. This is how they advance to the next round. They are judged in one of 3 categories: Disturbingness (How shocking it is to watch and how likely someone is to get PTSD from watching it), Violence (How excessive the force used is or how gorey the fatality is), and Awesomeness (How inventive the fatality is). I have both Disturbing and visceral because the most visceral one might not be the most disturbing. 

The judges for the PTSD category: A US marine, the ESRB (their decision counts as one of three votes), and your mother

The judges for the Visceral category: A janitor (judging how 
much he'll have to clean up), Sephiroth, and Walter White

The judges for the Replay category: A frat bro, TF2's Heavy, and the Boss (Saints Row)

Each judge gives a rating out of ten, and the contestant's score is the total of the three scores. Which character would take home the gold in each category and how would they do it? 




 Was it in the manga? Because in the show and movies there was only numbers, save for Lilith, Adam, and Kaworu.  




 That wasn't a mistype. I want to know who can consume his delicious Saiyan flesh, preferably not in one bite because that takes all the fun away. 

Bonus, who could prepare him the best? 




 Elsa fights against an Elsa-sized Eva unit 002 (because Shinji's a pansy). Asuka is scaled down appropriately as well as all the Eva's functions (So its AT field is only as strong as that of a human). If she loses in a match with the Eva's umbilical cord, can she survive for five minutes with no cord? 




 Arceus is said to have created the universe with its "Ten Thousand Arms", despite having a significant lack of any arms whatsoever. Also, its base stat total is less than that of Mega-Mewtwos X and Y, which shouldn't be possible for a mortal when comparing itself to an Omnipotent. Speaking of which, Arceus can't even learn all the moves in the games. So, there's only one logical conclusion I can come to. The Arceus who appears before Lucas and Dawn in Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, is not at His fully realized form. Similar to how the Judeo-Christian God appeared before Moses as a perpetually burning bush, Arceus limits His power before stepping into the world of mortals. Because the True Form is a abstract concept, and not necessarily equine, or even perceptible to the human mind. Like Cthulhu, perhaps Arceus exists in a higher dimension, and simply wqants to limit himself to a 3-dimensional form to keep from driving the Pokemon Master insane. 

That's my theory, anyway. What do you guys think? 














 [Elesa](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Elesa)

Elsa fights against Elesa's teams all by herself, without being able to spawn any Marshmallows. If she gets KO'd, she is allowed to spawn up to one Snowman at a time in the rematch. If she does, it becomes a normal Pokemon battle, with Elsa as the trainer, though she is allowed to switch in at any tine.  




 In all of the multiverse, is there anyone who's more emo than Shinji? Bonus if they aren't a joke character.  









 Your favorite character fights every pokemon in the Pokedex, gauntlet-style, in order. They start with Bulbasaur, then Ivysaur, then Venusaur, and so on. If they lose, they move on to the starters of the next generation (so if they lose Gen I, they start again at Chickorita). How far do they get, and which pokemon finally beats them? 














 A baseball team consisting of Goku, Superman, Godzilla, Hulk, Mewtwo, Evangelion unit-001 (including Shinji), Cloud Strife, One-Punch Man, and Eren Jeager's Titan Form. The game is scaled up to the size of Godzilla and the team gets a year of prep time to accommodate for the huge bats and balls. 

Game 1: A team of Pacific Rim Jeagers. 

Game 2: An all-star team of real baseball champions, each of them is Eva sized. 

Game 3: A team of Majin Buus

Game 4: 1v9, Cthulhu

Bonus: The entire team pilots an infinity Jeager-style (without Godzilla). Who's the strongest foe they can beat? 




 Elizabeth Comstock AKA Anna Dewitt vs the Doctor with his TARDIS

It's good, old-fashioned, time travel race. Starting in Columbia, who can get to Paris in 1983 to catch Revenge of the Jedi first? 




 Evangelion-001, with Shinji as its pilot, fights against legendary pokemon because I assume it would wipe the floor with anything short of legendary. Who's the strongest it can beat? Who's the strongest pokemon all three Evangelions can beat? 




 Typing feels amazing and I just don't want to stop ever. Give me an excuse to keep typing.  




 Elsa has started the eternal winter, so the sun has been blocked out for a day. Superman comes to find her and bring back summer, but is met with that magic blast thing that she nearly killed Anna with. Knowing a kiss from Hans probably won't save his life, Superman has no choice but to fight Elsa. Can she survive the onslaught long enough for Supes to freeze to death? Golden Age Superman, end of the movie Elsa with control of her powers.  









 After the death of Aeris, Cloud becomes a super Saiyan instead of a whiny bitch (looking at you, Advent Children.) 

He gets his Ultima sword and Ultima, KOTR, mega-All, and any other Materia he needs. He would be at max level before the transformation. His hair is really, *really*, blond. Who could he beat? 



















 The battle takes place on Namek because why not. Mewtwo can evolve into one of his Mega-evolutions and Frieza starts in his base form.  









 Midgar from Final Fantasy VII is under attack from the King of Monsters. 

Round 1: Beginning of the game, Cloud has not yet joined AVALANCHE
Round 2: Beginning of the game, level 7 Cloud has Barret and Tifa. 
Round 3: No Cloud, but the city has the Sister Ray. 
Round 4: End of disc 2, during the raid. 
Round 5: 1v1 Cloud vs Godzilla
Round 5.5: Winner gets to call in either Barret and Tifa or Mothra and Rodan is they get stomped too hard. 

Bonus: How does Big G do against the individual Weapons? Ultimate, Diamond, Emerald, and Ruby.  









 The chainsaws are automatically started and never run out of fuel. The shotgun needs to be reloaded but has infinite ammo. Also, the man with the shotgun dick still has his testicles, so he needs to worry about recoil.  




 The new Godzilla was the first one I've seen, and now I really want to see more Godzilla movies. Where can I watch the old ones online and where should I start?  




 The male and female individually, then together.  




 Me neither 



















 Round 1: Marty is 'Clint Eastwood' in the third movie, so he has his Peacemaker and ammo, and access to the hover board. Ash is from Army of Darkness, with either the Chainsaw or his robot hand, plus the Boomstick. 

Round 2: the DeLorean vs the Oldsmobile. The Oldsmobile is the armored version from Army of Darkness, and the DeLorean can't fly and is equipped with the Mr. Fusion, but the Time Circuits are scrambled so Marty can't time travel. It's a race from the Empire State Building to Yankee Stadium. 

Round 3: once they get to Yankee Stadium, it's a car-battle to the death. All of a sudden, the DeLorean can fly again, but still no time travel. 

In all three rounds, Marty has no problem killing Ash.  














 In Super Smash Bros Brawl. Who do they choose and who wins? 

Game rules: no items, Final Destination, 5 minutes, best of 5 rounds

Bonus: let them use the Smash Ball.  









 If your favorite character is already evil enough to control a goatee, they fight themselves with no goatee.  



















 Round 1: 4-way debate about something they know nothing about. 

Round 2: /u/Unidan and Bill Nye vs. Tyson and Mr. Rogers in a team rap battle. 

Round 3: all four have to separately convince Galactus not to consume Earth

Round 4: /u/Unidan and Mr. Rogers are counter-terrorist vs. Nye and Tyson as terrorists in a Counter-Strike (Source because why not). Best of five rounds. 

Round 5: everyone is leading their own equally powerful nation, each the size and wealth of the Cold War USA. Assuming Nye and Tyson don't know how to actually build a rocket, who wins the Space Race?

Round 6: Everyone gets their choice of a Buster Sword, dagger, or one- or two-handed axe. They are dropped into the Capital Wasteland from Fallout 3 one week before the Lone Wanderer escapes and must survive. The first person to find anything from the game can have it. Who lasts the longest? 









 They have to be attractive because of their own charisma, not power of any kind. So no, DOOM can't win because he can tell any Latverian woman to sleep with him.  




 Deadpool and Joker aren't allowed to kill, they just have to rustle as many Jimmies as possible. 

for the lazy: /r/braveryjerk and /r/coaxedintoasnafu 




 I'm running Windows 7 on an HP Pavilion dv6, and after LEGO Marvel Superheroes crashed on me, I was told that Aero ran out of memory and Windows changed to a less memory-intensive theme. But now that I have a whole lot of RAM available, the theme won't change back to the one I had before. I've tried manually changing it back in Control Panel but it didn't work.  




 Protectors of the American way decide to run the country. Who are their running mates, who wins the votes and from which states? Does the winner do a good job and get re-elected or does the loser come back four years later and fix the place?

EDIT: congress has made an amendment so Kryptonians can run.  




 Out of everything, which is the most entertaining way to:

Travel a few blocks
Commute to work
Long-distance road trip (Cross-Country)
Long-Distance (space travel) 




 Anything that he can do as a Kryptonian (so no Super Saiyan transformation, no almost-death-thing whose name escapes me).  




 Raditz gains the ability to come back every time he dies. He's always just as strong as he was at the time of his first death, but he decides to try and take out some of the strongest warriors in the multiverse. 
How many times does he have to try before he wins?
In no particular order, the combatants:

Mewtwo
The Boss (Saints Row IV)
Frieza
Hercules
Super Perfect Cell
Batman
Superman
Deadpool
Wolverine
Thor
Goku (Namek Saga, non-super Saiyan)
Gohan (SSJ2, Cell Games)
Vegeta (peak, non-super Saiyan)
Goku (absolute maximum)

 Goku from Battle of the Gods vs. A basket of week-old kittens.  




 Octodad from Octodad: Dadliest Catch vs. Goat from Goat Simulator.  









 [Mewtwo](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mewtwo_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\)) with all its powers from X and Y, including one megastone per fight.  



















 At basketball.  




 Since Godzilla would probably lose to all 700-something Pokemon, how would he fare against only the Pokemon in OU? 


List of current OU:

Aegislash, Alakazam, Azumarill, Bisharp, Blissey, Breloom, Charizard, Clefable, Conkeldurr, Deoxys's Speed form, Ditto, Dragonite, Espeon, Excadrill, Ferrothorn, Galvantula, Garchomp, Genesect, Gengar, Gliscor, Goodra, Greninja, Gyarados, Heatran, Kangaskhan, Klefki, Landorus, Landorus's Therian form, Latios, Lucario, Mamoswine, Mandibuzz, Mawile, Pinsir, Washing Machine Rotom, Scizor, Skarmory, Smeargle, Talonflame, Thundurus, Togekiss, Trevenant, Tyranitar, Venusaur, Volcarona

Banned Items: Soul Dew, Gengarite, Kangaskhanite, Lucarionite

Anything that can mega evolve is allowed to unless its item is banned or hasn't been announced yet.  




 Anna is obviously the younger if the two. Elsa actually came of age on Coronation Day, which would mean Anna is still underage. Why does Anna even consider marriage at all, and why would Elsa not point that out?  




 The battle takes place in my kitchen. Maximum of 30 mins prep time. Both are Bloodlusted

Round 1: Which is more delicious for dinner after a day of work?
Round 2: Maximum power, cooked by an expert of each food. 
Round 3: Both are armed with medieval broadswords. 

Bonus: Which would have an easier time killing Batman? 




 I haven't seen /u/Zoltarr777, /u/DeadeyeSigma, or /u/pokefollower in a while. Where are you guys? It's pretty much just me and /u/toonlink10 left.  




 Rules: No new things out of the blue. It has to have some connection to your actual feats. That's it.  














 All the omnipotent gods (I.e not limited to one region like the Greek or Norse gods) are competing against each other. 

Round 1: who can build the best universe the fastest? Starting with nothing, they must build a utopian paradise and fill it with diverse life, laws of physics, light sources, and anything a civilization would need to survive. 

Round 2: who can build the best world in 6 days? Whose universe would last the longest without all the civilizations tearing each other apart? Given six full days, as long as it took in Genesis, who will win this interdimensional game of Civ?

Round 3: Who can destroy said universe with natural disasters most uniquely? Not just a snap of the fingers and the universe is gone, something like Noah's flood. 

Round 4: bloodlusted fight to the death takes place in a limbo state, a complete absence if anything.  




 Mewtwo is sentient like in the movie, with stats and moves from X and Y. He has a completely filled trainer's bag and has again kidnapped Nurse Joy, as well as a move re-learner. He has both Mega Stones, but can only carry one at a time. His Nurse and Move Tutor stay behind when he goes to fight, so if he wants to heal he has to leave and come back. His goal, using the creation trio to travel between universes, is to take all of them over by killing or recruiting (Mystery Dungeon style) all of their strongest fighters. For example, he has to kill every legendary pokemon who refuses to cooperate, every Godzilla monster, the entire Justice League, etc. Can he do it? If not, who stops him? 




 Mewtwo is encountered in three games, all at level 70: FireRed/LeafGreen, HeartGold/SoulSilver (We're assuming the remakes are canon because they're more recent) and X/Y. The Mewtwo in HGSS is rumored to be Red's Mewtwo after being released, but since HGSS takes place two years after FRLG, this can't be true because Mewtwo is still level 70. If it was released by Red, it would have leveled up by at least one at some point. Levels represent a pokemon's natural growth, with an older pokemon being a higher level due to its age rather than directly being linked to power. In the game, this manifests in levels, but for this theory we'll assume that level=age. This means that Mewtwo is the same age two years later, which can't be possible. Therefore, the Mewtwo as caught by Ethan and Lyra is a different Mewtwo from the one caught by Red and Leaf. Then there's the matter of Calem and Serena's Mewtwo, which is again level 70, and this time there's two in Kalos: Mewtwo X and Mewtwo Y, one for each Mega Stone. It's implied that X and Y take place around the same time as Red and Blue, because Blue was actually in Kalos and the one person who mentioned him doesn't mention that he's a champion or gym leader, meaning at that point he hadn't beaten the Pokemon League yet. This could also be when Sycamore got his hands on Kanto starters, but that's a different theory. So there's two Mewtwos in Kalos, and two in Kanto, albiet at different times. There's another theory stating that the Mewtwo in Kalos is in fact Red's, which ran away to live in secrecy, but it didn't age, so that's out of the question. Since the one Mewtwo we have canon information about, Red's, was the son of Mew, born on February 6, we can assume this means that the three other Mewtwos are also directly the children of Mews. Mewtwo is a mutation of the Mew DNA, meaning Mewtwo can't reproduce stably. The Kanto Mew probably gave birth to both Mewtwos which have inhabited Cerulean Cave (at different times), and the Kalos Mew probably had twin Mewtwos. This isn't even taking into account non-main series games like Mystery Dungeon or Ranger.  




 Assuming he knows how to work a modern car. He also tries to steal as much as he can from Wayne Manor and the Batcave.  









 What are the strongest and weakest characters you can think of, and what's the most balanced battle they could be in?
