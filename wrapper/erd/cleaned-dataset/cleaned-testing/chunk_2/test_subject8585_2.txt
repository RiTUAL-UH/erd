 Really?, I guess the morals of the whole Bible were cherry-picked to death by the founders of the US or at least the Republican party? 

You make the declaration that your Christian god has given us absolute moral laws to abide by given your view. You say that this is a nation of freedom of religion as long as all other religions acknowledge that your religion is dominate and others must just suck it up.  

As far as I can read, the bible and it's new and old parts are as immoral as any book comes.  If you want to ban an obscene book from the public or school libraries it would be this book although I would never do that because I don't believe in banning books.  

I'd like to remind you that other religions say their morals are as right as yours.  You've decided to put your faith in a Christian god.  Good luck with that! 




 Have you ever considered that the image that God created mankind is not a physical mirror image but a potential mirror image of His intent and His compassion reflected in your soul/spirit?   




 Maybe "God' intentionally made the possibility of what "we" would call an aberration of nature for a purpose. Maybe he had a purpose for these people? 

I'm not one to delve into knowing the mind of such a God but it seems to me that if there is a god, all his creations were meant for some purpose even if they don't fit into our limited and contrived boxes and as such maybe, just maybe, this god is testing your compassion and what this god gave people as far as intellect.  

I kinda remember a sermon were Jesus said something along the lines of "as you treat the least fortunate then my father shall treat you".

Jog my memory please!   




 You define these Christians as hypocritical.  I do not.  A thorough reading of the Bible states that true believers are compelled to spread the gospel of Christ and make unbelievers understand the consequences of the choice they are given.  If they then choose to not follow the rules and commandments of Christianity then they shall burn in hell if the Christians don't do it first.  They've just replaced the actual burning with yelling taunts and insults. Everyone likes 
some encouragement!

The tired argument that Fundamental Christians are tolerant is laughable.  They are as intolerant as the most Fundamentalist Muslim radicals. 

A true follower of Christianity understands this and I respect their devout faith. It certainly rings truer than the milk-toasty pick and choose bible verses that fits whatever society you're in now deems moral for the majority of Christians of late. Talk about hypocritical! 

I'm saying that the true Christians aren't hypocritical or self-apologizing for their persecution of non-Christians. They truly believe that conversion is a matter of everlasting life.  Where I would rein them in is when it comes to mine or my children's rights to a neutral place to work or go to school. 




 Okay, I'm getting the picture now.  I've had to pay the property tax on my mothers house too.  I wouldn't include that in my own tax bill though.  You and your sister and mother have moved back on to help offset his tax burden and their housing situation.  That is your (PA=you'ins) choice but you didn't have to.  So don't include this in you recap of taxes you have to pay.  The $1600+ would be the same as if you were buying food, repairs to the home, insurance or paid for a replacement AC.  

What I'm saying is you misrepresented yourself in your original argument with ACA concerning your tax liabilities.   




 
"If in your world "Christians" are bullying non Christian people, then they aren't Christians at all."

In the real world, real Christians from many denominations have not only bullied but persecuted and many times murdered non-Christians or Christians from other sects all over the world.  Your No True Scotsman argument is quite false.

As far as your question about my own experience I would like to point out that I never said I was persecuted.  I said members of my family were bullied in school by Christians.  One example I can give you among many was the bullying my niece received at her school from her classmates when she "revealed" that her grandparents were Buddhist.  One would have thought by the reactions she received that she had said her grandparents were Satanist that practiced ritual baby killings.  The mean comments and ostracizing she got from the other kids were vicious and unrelenting even though she, herself was Christan  She would come home and cry uncontrollably because she couldn't defend herself or her grandparents at her age and none of her teachers ever tried stop the bullying.  This is the reason that these clubs, even in elementary schools are needed.  

It's not an agenda supposedly pushing atheism or even homosexuality.  It's about giving children of different backgrounds, different faiths or lack of, and sexual orientation a safe place to express themselves, vent, and connect with others of like mind.  The sad thing is many schools willfully oppose and actively try to prevent these non-traditional clubs from forming.  
 




 I'm going to assume that the 30.57% for property tax is based on the % of the total taxes you pay which you state is $16,000.  That would mean your property tax is around $4800.  

I pay about $1800 a year in property tax on a house appraised at $100,000. Assuming rates in PA are the same, you are living in a home valued at around $250,000 on a income of $25,000?  

I can see where you might appreciate the help of your relatives.  With such a limited income you couldn't afford a mortgage, insurance, and taxes.  Did you inherit this property?   




 Your total tax rate is 64% (or higher because standard deductions weren't included) in your earnings bracket? Where the heck do you live that state or city taxes are that high? 




 How are they using bulling as a weapon?  A weapon against what? The fact that Christians in the the USA have dominated and bullied other members of other religions for centuries and are now crying discrimination because they can't bully and discriminate? You should apologize! The only agenda I see from atheists is full inclusion into society and the protection of their children from hateful comments like, "you and your whole family is going to burn in Hell" from a 8 year old classmate.  

Whether or not you are aware of Christian religious bulling in schools it in fact happens and my family has has been in its cross-hairs.  If you think that atheist are only the bully maybe you're confused with the rights that adult atheists have tried to stand up for but, as far as the school yard persecution, that is alive and well and these clubs may help to keep these groups (non-christians and atheists) safe and maybe even excepted despite the bigotry and myopic views that are handed down to the unfortunate children of ignorant parents.  




 In a convenience store in New Orleans in front of the clerk an old black man asked me if I wanted to be a virgin again and said he could do it.  I was a 34 yr old white woman holding my 4 yr old son's hand.    




 Are you writing a dissertation or something? To your questions, he doesn't subscribe to any hard religions and is keeping his mind open but doesn't identify with Satanism anymore.  I think your comment was valid.  The point I was trying to make is that non-religious parents sometimes make the same mistakes as religious ones....in that your children aren't really your own. That you may wish for a  cookie-cutter imprint on them, don't expect it because they are separate human beings with a mind of their own.  




 Funny but I did research Satanism at the time and came up with more or less the same conclusion although I refrained from quizzes. 

He's 18 now and has a completely different perspective.  He does play the bass and after a brief love affair with Pantera has embraced Jazz and Blues.  His IQ is around 160 and will be entering the Navy's nuke program soon unless I can talk him out of being a MU!

To all the freethinker parents out there beware and yes, it's a good idea to teach your child basic religious instruction. 




 I'm shaking my head in disbelief that you've equated physical strength to intellectual and emotional strength. Women are for the most part, physically weaker then men. So what. The largest mammal on the earth is a female. Do you really equate that to some elementary school yard argument that men are, as a gender, smarter then women and thus supports the bibles' arguments of gender inequality when it comes to matters of social involvement in religion and politics? 




 Being an atheist I thought very hard about my influence on my child.  I wanted him to be a freethinker and hoped he would come close to the same conclusions I've come to so I tried to teach him critical thinking skills assuming he would reach the "right" conclusion.  Was I ever thrown for a loop when he announced he was a Satanist on his Facebook page when he was 15!  




 Well if we are to dive into the reasons gay marriage should be illegal under the Christian Flag then we should also consider the circumstances that would allow marriages to be legal under the same flag.  

First, polygamy.  Many of the Old Testament Prophets and Patriarchs had multiple wives, including Lamech, Abraham, Jacob, Esau, Gideon, Saul, David, Solomon, Rehoboam, Elkanah, Ashur, Abijah and Jehoiada. Some interpretations also suggest Moses had a second wife in Tharbis. Other polygamists identified in the Bible include Ahab, Ahasuerus, Ashur, Belshazzar, Benhadad, Caleb, Eliphaz, Ezra, Jehoiachin, Jehoram, Jerahmeel, Joash, Machir, Manasseh, Mered, Nahor, Simeon, and Zedekiah.

Second, the age of the bride was usually customary to be 12 years or even younger. 

Third, that rape victims were required to marry their rapist since their value as property was diminished. Deuteronomy 22:28-29.

Forth, slaves or prisoners of war were forced in marriage. Numbers 31:7-18 and Judges 21: 10-24.

Want to base US laws on what your myopic view of Christianity deems fitting as marriage then go right ahead and see how your Christian flag gets saluted!  




 Indulge me to allow the rephrasing of your statement:

 "The argument is that men and women differ and are not the same. You guys like to foment the idea that that is not true - that men and women are the same, have same capabilities, same responses, same reactions, and you are simply incorrect."

The argument is that blacks and whites differ and are not the same. You guys like to (sic)foment the idea that that is not true - that blacks and whites are the same, have same capabilities, same responses, same reactions, and you are simply incorrect.

Sounds a lot like an argument for the Jim Crow, separate but equal laws doesn't it?
 
Racism and sexism are both based on fear and the idea of superiority, dominance and submission.  The fact is the bible, from the beginning to the end, stresses the superiority of men over women. Whether one can prove Paul promoted this or not is irrelevant since the rest of the "good book" is quite clear.  




 You made the statement that men and women differ in some sort of mental capacity that affects their abilities to respond or react which somehow prevents a woman from being equal to a man. I asked you for examples and instead you asked me for examples from my experience in the military which I will provide after you defend your original statement.     




 rape seed oil = canola oil.  




 I'd like you to show some examples where women and men have different capabilities, responses or reactions that aren't culturally ingrained.  

As a former military member I've seen the gamut and find that men are no more different in their intellectual makeup then women especially under stress.    




 B. This one always got me.  Eve was deceived by a smooth talking serpent that claimed to know the mind of God and what would happen to them.  Since Eve didn't know right from wrong how could she make an ethical decision based on her experience. (If you've ever had young children you will know that telling them not to do something doesn't mean they understand that it's wrong or evil). Adam is influenced by Eve, who is, for all intent and purposes is a lessor creature and as naive as he is but he succumbs to, not a sly talking serpent, but a mere woman. Does he get the brunt of God's wrath for being gullible? No! Eve does! She has to bear children in pain for her "crime" alone. They both have to leave Eden but Adam had no specific punishment for his "crime".

Sorry, but just typing this out makes the story even more ridiculous!  




 From my experience and that of my mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, great great grandmother etc., we all agree that all men and women came from a women body following the conception required from both sexes.  

The fact that the bible considers women an afterthought and not made in the same image or glory of god is the reason that half of the human population has been treated like sub-humans without the basic freedoms of thought, speech, movement or self-determination that the average man enjoys.  Paul clearly defines a woman's role as existing for the benefit of men. To me, it's not much different then Playboy's exploitation of women.   




 As to your original question.....YES! 




 My ex was a framer/carpenter and grew a beard every winter.  I went through this same thing every spring when he shaved it off although it was kinda like makin' out with a different guy for awhile! 




 First person to mention emotional pain. That kind of pain can last a long time and no medicine can really help.  I'd give you gold if I had it.  Sorry for your loss. 




 Diverticulitis!  Occurs when small indigestible things like seeds, corn or bits of nuts get stuck in small pockets that have formed in the lower intestine and then become infected.  When the first bout occurred they gave me 1.0 gram of dilaudid which is 8x stronger than morphine and that wasn't even close enough to allow me to stand up straight!  The worst part is that I'm a chef and can no longer eat anything that has those ingredients.   




 I think Annie Oakley said it best when she said men, that were a sure shot, were considered marksmen but when she did it, it was trick-shooting.  

In this day and age, the favorite double standard between male and female managers is that men have an opinion on how to get things done and women have an opinionated view that is female centered. Complete BS!  




 Good for you bitch! 




 As the overweight middle-aged woman that uses the scooters in the grocery store and gets the occasional funny looks from some people I don't even know, I say screw them.  This is what they don't know.  I'm a military veteran that is 90% disabled. I can walk short distances but prolonged standing or walking is excruciating. The steroids I'm given have significantly contributed to my size along with depression and PTSD. I resisted using a cart at shopping outings but my husband loves to shop and browse so I gave in.   

So to all the redditors out there that say I'm not a person, I'm gross, don't have any self-discipline, selfish because I took a cart from an old person, or whatever other vitriolic spew comes forth, I'll tell you to look in the mirror. How many of you have served your country and suffered from it?  To those that have served you know, but the majority of comments are from those that have no clue and to those I say you're welcome. Every time I get those looks or comments here I hold my head up high and wish everyone a peaceful good day! 

  




 The problem is that you're being intellectually dishonest with yourself and you aren't living in the reality that those "words" can motivate people to justify their position that they are entitled to withhold a persons right to full representation in government and in the free market. 

Here in Texas, I'm not allowed to hold a public office even though I'm a highly decorated and disabled veteran of the military.  Why?  Because I'm an atheist and I refuse to say that an ice cream cone on a hot summers day is my definition of a god.    




 The church I grew up and was confirmed in refused to let me get married there because I hadn't attended in 8 years. I was a minor and my mother moved to another side of our city. He was British so this didn't surprise me although I was disappointed with the congregation's reaction. 




 Heh, my mom was talking about this and I can't help but chime in on the subject (I am her son).  Honestly, I really have no opinion on the subject, as I have never had a partner say "Eeew, I don't like you being cut, so we just aren't going to have sex." or vice versa.  I am not any happier or in any way saddened by being cut.  Hey, at the very bottom line, I'm a little grateful for being able to be lazy with hygiene (although I'm not) and get away with it.  Also: As I know no different, I can't say for sure that I'm as sexually "effective" as I would otherwise be, but I'm not impotent, and that's the (relatively, because I don't plan on having any kids any time soon) important part.

Oh, and I know a few people that are Jewish, and it's more about honoring Abraham than appeasing any kind of god. 




 Your putting up a paper tiger.  

Explain to me why I, as a disabled military veteran with an approved dog can be refused service from a taxi driver because his religious beliefs think that dogs are unclean or my religious beliefs won't let you carry a bottle of wine in my luggage.  What if, as a taxi business, I wouldn't pick you up and drop you off at your home because my religious beliefs dictated that as a woman you have no rights?   




 Are you a parent?  




 I covered the ability to provide part.  My analysis is not "silly". If you're too lazy to research the topic then try this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGx4IlppSgU Although not comprehensive into full series of the Mask of Men it's a starting point!  




 I'm not ashamed but I do regret my part in the decision. His father had a say in the matter too.  However, your anger at me is misdirected.  Our society puts a lot of pressure to conform and while my decision was partially based on this I do not think he is deformed or had his sexuality affected in any way.
  
With that being said, I'm sure your own mother and father would like to circumcise whatever organ that causes the vitriolic bile that spews from your mouth and replace it with a civilized prosthetic.        




 No. There were studies then that indicated circumcision reduced the rate of cancer and other diseases but they were later  dismissed because the subjects studied were in third-world countries were sanitation/hygiene weren't considered a priority.      




 Hoping it's not a nail! 




 As an Atheist/Buddhist I had my son circumcised because of health reasons and concerns from his father as far as being different.  I've asked him as an adult and he has no problem with it.  As as women and have experienced both I'd say I prefer a circumcised penis. Sorry Foreskin!  




 Only the balls man, only the balls! Dicks don't cause pregnancy, nads do.  Keep the penis! 




 I think you hit the nail on the head!  




 Unlike girls, that naturally "become" women based on their first menses, some cultures feel the need to provide a time in which boys "become" men based also on their ability to procreate since there is no specific event for males.  Menstruation and childbirth=pain and blood so, in some cultures, not surprisingly, they require boys to demonstrate their ability to withstand pain and/or survive an injury involving blood, although this can also coincide with an ability to provide for his family.  The example above does both and also puts the burden of birth control on the male!  




 Again my friend, what are you referring to? 

You have the right to refuse service to anyone as long as it's not based on sex, religion, national origin, race or sexual orientation.  These categories are based on federal laws.  Do you feel you have the religious right to circumvent federal laws.....yes or no? 

 




 Not my first memory but when I was six I remember the phone rang one evening and my Mom answered. She then threw the receiver at my Dad saying it was his girlfriend. Two months later he was gone and my mother started working. We were babysat at home and on July 5 I fell and broke my arm looking for fireworks my gran had given us. I spent 2 days in the hospital then went to live with my cousins and never went back home. Fast-forward to 2009 and my gran died on July 4th.  You'd think Independence Day would be a sad time for me but it hasn't. 

I hope Christmas wasn't totally ruined for you. 




 "gay couple discriminating based on religion".....what are you talking about? 




 Did you type these estimates/statistics with a straight face? LOL 




 Reminds me of "The Incredible Mr Limpet"! 




 If you have a public business then yes, you have to give a valid reason to refuse service. 

It's not based on a sense of entitlement but a history of discrimination that did not allow blacks to use the same front door or stay at the same hotel where they entertaining whites ect.

If you are going to discriminate based on race, religion, sex, or disability then you have to state this and prove why. 




 Sorry Sid, at first I thought you meant that all gays were good at flower arrangements and decorating cakes. You still however, haven't answered the soundness of your proposed business plan.  




 Considering that HC covered 282 laws it would definably be impressive!

The problem with the Big 10 is that six of the "laws" directly conflict with the US Constitution. The remaining four are almost universal and do not need to be tied to a specific religion.    




 The largest Christian charity is Christian but not Catholic.

Real justice under your oldest, continuously operating institution in the world that condoned murder upon innocents and "heretics" in the past for over 400 years and in real time, (it's denial of their support the Catholic Church gave Hitler.) leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Don't believe me LIU. 




 Well said. 




 Does a person starting a business that only targets 10% of the population across all socio-economic status that may or may not get married much less use a florist or baker sound like they have a good business plan? 

BTW, your narrow-minded stereotype of gays is almost laughable if it weren't out-dated.     




 It can if it will get all those Christians to stop insisting on the "big ten" being posted everywhere based on the US being a Christian Nation! 




 I should clarify that I'm looking for the reasons or arguments to justify any discrimination based on religious beliefs and how far should you be allowed to go and not solutions.  If you believe religious discrimination is okay then is it okay for you to be discriminated against based on another religion. The case of Muslim taxi drivers that won't allow service dogs or bottles of alcohol in in their cabs comes to mind.  




 "What church do you go to" 




 You don't have to blow up. Calmly tell them that you disagree and that while you understand and appreciate their concerns you must follow your own conscience. Maybe you can add that sometime in the future you may change your mind just to give them hope and shut them up. 

I understand how it hurts to think that family could think this way but you need to understand that they don't wish this upon you. They really believe this to be your fate and only want the best for you however misguided. Life is short. Live your life as true to yourself as you possibly can no matter is it upsets ANYONE. Live in reality always and never live a lie! 




 You, your parents and brother are all behaving hypocritically. Is your sister the source of tension? Why can't you all hold your own opinions?

 




 If you are an atheist or agnostic and have read the AA material that treats "patients" like some primitive sub-humans that will someday see the light then well, its no wonder its supposed miracle cure doesn't work. Just a little snake oil and a lot of jobs in the rehab business are on the hook if this lie is ever found out.
   




 I could be wrong now, but I don't think so!

At an AA meeting you are depending on others that are emotionally stunted due to their substance dependence to help you through your own problems. Sounds like a bad plan to me. 




 The expectation though is that you will eventually "mature" or grow to understand that your limited view of a higher power actually is the Christian god.  I guess that if believing a doorknob is your higher power and it helps to stop you from self destruction then go for it. 

For me and others like me, this is intellectually dishonest so the program could never provide any help. I never had any legal problems involving alcohol. I just knew I was drinking too much and needed help so I self referred to the Navy's rehab program.  What I didn't do was check my constitutional right to freedom of religion at the door in order to get medical care.    




 I find your attitude about 12-step programs refreshing.  So many of those that have been helped by AA/NA, which are few compared to the number of people that have tried it, become almost cultish about 12-steps being the only program that works.

I'm an atheistic Buddhist so AA's principles were in conflict with the Buddhist principle that the power to change comes from within yourself and, of course the fact that I hold no belief in Gods.

There are several organizations that you can recommend. I used Rational Recovery but there is also S.O.S., Secular Organization for Sobriety and Women for Sobriety.  

WFS is particularly helpful because the challenges female alcoholics face are usually different then mens and some AA/NA groups can be predatory toward women that are in a vulnerable state i.e., the 13th step.  

Again thanks for having the insight to realize AA is not a one fits all fix.
Best wishes to you!
 




 "I don't think the literature, or the opinion of many recovering addicts, agrees with your notion that AA "is clearly a religious program" and requires a belief in God."

Several federal court opinions have found that compulsory participation in AA/NA is unconstitutional because of its religious nature.  Have you read the condescending chapter in the Big Book addressed to the Agnostic? It clearly says that a higher power is a reference to God.
 




 The moral of the story is don't let anyone define you including yourself. 




 I agree that actually making love with a woman is preferable to watching and jacking off to a porn video. I like to watch porn and sometimes with my SO *BUT*......
The problem is most porn makes a caricature of what actual sex is like so that people, especially if they are young with no experience, think that this is the norm when it's not.  Young women don't feel they measure up to the women they see  in the videos. Young men often feel inadequate compared to the videos. When this is their bench mark, and you have to include the performances of their favorite entertainers, they have no REAL REFERENCE POINT to gauge their real  sexuality and how to express it.  This has led to to so much sexual dysfunction among Americans that is could be be referred to as an epidemic.

Pat's worse than a moron. He's a charlatan that has bilked millions to pay for his extreme wealthy lifestyle. He's smart and savvy. A moron doesn't know better but Pat is the poster child of why religious entities such as church's like his needs to be audited by the IRS.

He is nothing more than a snake-oil salesmen and HE KNOW THIS! Just can't wait for his except status is pulled.     




 You didn't listen to Pat, the pictures are the problem because we can never measure up. Maxim did teach me how to hypnotize a live lobster though the purpose of this knowledge was just to impress/seduce a woman.   




 Okay, I agree but only if you include men that read Maxim. It too offers the same idiotic advise to men as Cosmo gives to women only spelled different. 




 You obviously should be so proud of your Dad. 




 Urine is sterile by the way.  




 Can you explain? I thought any number multiplied by 0=0.  




 Pissing on yourself or your "friend" will stop the pain from some plants and insects such as bull nettles, mosquitoes, ant bites and some jellyfish stings. Ammonia works well too if ya don't have it in ya.  




 Nice try! 




 And was appealed and overturned. 




 Most menstruating women that have cramps don't go to sickcall unless it's severe or are bleeding heavily or for too long. Believe it or not, women know that Pamperin and Motrin can help and use those.  Most though, just get through it and get on with life. 

What exceptional story are you referring to? 




 What a beautiful calli! We have one that's a stray. She drinks from our Koi pond and catches the mice so we feed her dry food. She got flack from our two cats but doesn't anymore.  Try this; make sure Sasha is there before you feed her. Give Sasha a Tablespoon of what you're feeding the stray (even if it's the same thing you feed your cat everyday, Sasha will go for it for territorial reasons).  It's a distraction and it reinforces a positive element to the visits from the stray.  Worked for us, they now touch noses through the glass door to our sunroom.

As far as the hole......bad idea!  You're inviting squirrels, coons, skunks and possums to make their home there. 

Good luck and best wishes! 




 What happened? 




 Blame it on their period? JK I know guys get it too. 




 Chef here, most of us keep super glue in our knife bag for this exact purpose. Also, black pepper is great to stop bleeding on a small cut. 




 This may surprise you but no.  Some of the best sex talkers out there are guys! 




 I'm sorry for this but I just imagined Lil Jon saying "What!, what?. 

Any deaf people out the that want to enjoy phone sex? Maybe I'll make a million printing the "white" pages. 




 Keep trying.  Do you have assists other than the VA? You might try the DVR in your state 




 The military medical corps is advised to try to distinguish between real medical situations vs. those that are suspect. The end result is everyone is considered suspect until otherwise proven because of ppl trying to get out of duty, which, if you are in a medical emergency can be fatal in the wrong command and can't get proper medical evaluation.  




 Hope your Dad is Okay but still, NOT COOL! 




 I've heard if you crush up the tablets and heat them with ammonia it makes a very good mesquito remedy. 




 Sounds like my uncle.  He has prostrate problems that he take meds for fluid retention. He was hospitalized for it and has high blood pressure but he'll drink a 2 liter coke a day and even salts his pizza and smokes. He's homeless and I let him stay here briefly with me and my husband during which he pissed on our guest bed. I made him wear diapers the rest of the time but he became insulted and left. If he doesn't care, why should I? 




 Exactly  




 military? 




 You're so right. I've heard many stories of the Navy blowing off back pain, men and women but women have to go through the ol' is it your period or pregnant part first even if we're post menopausal and it's in our record lol. 
VA care isn't much better. 




 If you cut off a small piece called an "eye" that then can sprout it's possible but doubtful.  




 Really dude, What kind of outward sign do you need to have your arbitrary pain taken seriously?   After being given Motrin and sent back to the field when I couldn't stand up-right I ended up at the local civilian hospital and after they took the time to look for a cause, found I was suffering from diverticulitis (not rare) and given morphine for pain.

I hope you're not anywhere in the medical field especially the military. 




 Yeh well maybe she forgot or didn't know that a potato cause those symptoms.  




 Maybe. It's not legally considered part of the sex industry though child labor laws might come into play. I guess you wouldn't be able to call your service as Googoo, ooo, oooo, ooooo, Gaga, aa, aaa , aaaaa!   




 My family member hasn't faced murder charges but he told me he killed his best friends' wife because she took/sold all his pain medication until he died of cancer. I have no evidence he did this and someone else was with him. I only have his word.     




 Phone sex operator. It's legal, you can be any age or in any shape/disability and work your own hours. Put an ad in the paper. Great tax write-offs too! 




 "woman came in complaining of severe stomach pain. He was expecting to diagnose her with menstrual cramps or something else rudimentary and gave her basic pain meds etc"

This pisses me off. As a female with a 20 yr career in the Navy I can't count how many times some male corpsman blew off my symptoms this way.  If this story was true, which I doubt because a vine growing from a potato would not be able to grow outside the uterus/vagina and make its way to the spine, and she was in severe abdominal pain and the only thing he did was give her Motrin then send her on her way he would have been brought up on charges if it was found she was suffering from a real medical emergency condition. 

That said, I think your buddy was just drunkenly jerking your leg. Thanks for letting me vent though!  




 Barry, can you back any of your statements with facts?

Or are you just being ignorant and ranting because you're well, ignorant. 




 No, this is soo right! 




 Sorry bicyclists, but you get what you deserve. Saw this all the time in San Diego. Bike clubs would ride in formation and since there were so many of them they would block stop signs and force the whole group to go through, blocking regular traffic and pedestrian traffic. I guess the spandex and the fact that they are "what?" means they are above the rules.  




 Why do you think I should have reverence for a book that has negatively influenced the treatment of half of the human population simply because of the sex that they were born into. The bible, and specifically the Genesis story has condemned women into second-class status slightly higher than a child. Woman are held responsible for the downfall of all mankind and because of your "good" book women have paid tremendous injustices over the centuries for just being born female.  

 The story of A   E is a myth that has been used to subjugate women  by blame and slander. As for the morality of 1,000 years ago when slavery and entire nations drew their moral code from the bible, I just wonder what kind of planet you think live on ???  




 Let their dog shit all over the complex but especially the area around the mail boxes and not pick it up so we have to smell it when picking up our mail.  




 You're not too well acquainted with the correctional/justice system. As a law student you should be. Jails don't correct anyone. If anything they create criminals.  

My question was how is the law practically applied? Does society only arrest those that say, threaten to jump off a bridge and in doing so tie up traffic? 




 Haven't heard this in years but it's appropriate, http://youtu.be/3Vl9Uz-rmIU 




 Pre-law student,  I was not arrested after my suicide attempt and, as far as I know, you can't charge someone who's dead with self murder, how is this law (if there is one) applied? 




 If you were a burned out ex-meth user, felon, and alcoholic homeless guy with permanent brain damage that has left you with mental health problems along with physical problems brought about by poor lifestyle choices, ie, diet, smoking, no exercise etc. which together makes you unable to hold down any kind of job and you have no friends or family that would be hurt if you died and you also decided to commit suicide in a manner that wouldn't affect any strangers, would it still be considered selfish? 




 So what? I don't care if Christianity, Judaism. or Islam has solid evidence of interpretation. Which they don't. What does solid evidence of interpretation mean?  
  If you mean that a religious myth has had a solid tradition of being handed down through generations of interpretations then..Big Deal! Ignorant parents raising ignorant kids. What is your point?
  The constitution of the US is infinitively greater than your holy book.
   




 Makes me wonder how they did that. As a parent you would think that it would be impossible not to develop emotional attachments. Did they just turn it on after the first birthday? 




 Pepper, never ever concede that which you have no proof of. Ever.

You are correct that Perry and his cronies' only objective is to change the foundation of our state government to be based on Christian Biblical rules and laws including the education of our children. I base this on his ties to the Dominionist's organizations he has supported and their specific legislation. I also agree that educator's within my state abuse and flaunt established laws and the state doesn't come down hard enough when violations are discovered. 
There are, however, a few diligent rational folks in Texas that have managed, to some degree, to keep them in check.

If you know of a school district that has allowed creationism to be taught as fact you need to let me know where or at least contact the TBE. 

BTW: Regarding concessions, I'm not a teacher but thanks anyway.  I'm only a disabled Navy(cook) Veteran that has had an interest in Paleontology for the last 30 years.  




 That's the mafia's take on it anyway. 




 Yes I do.

"In July 2011, the Texas Board of Education, which oversees the Texas Education Agency, did not approve anti-evolution instructional materials submitted by International Databases, LLC, while continuing to approve materials from mainstream publishers."

It might be helpful if you thoroughly read the entire contents of the links you provide.  That said, critical analysis of darwinian evolution could include the small debate between punctuated equilibrium vs uniform phyletic gradualism. The TEA does not require the teaching of creationism. Critical analysis is good to teach public school students. It also helps when reading articles on the internet.  




 Teaching creationism is not required in Texas. JS 




 Thank God it's working! 




 From the Bible, we find passages that won't even acknowledge a child until they are a month old. Maybe because of the death rate but at least one would simply acknowledge that they existed but they didn't.
