 I never abused in the sense of addiction. Just in the illegality part.

I don't currently have moda (no script) but I do have Adrafinil, is this suitable? 




 I'm no professional, but I know my way around customs and drugs. I'd say just bring them in your bag, not in any container, just in the carry on/suitcase. Suitcases aren't checked as...precariously. 




 I have an incredibly bad work ethic and focus on work, I've taken all sorts of CNS (Central nervous system) stimulants. even Amphetamines, and recently I've came around to Afinil's. do you guys think these are viable option for it, if so which ones would be the best. All advice is welcome!
