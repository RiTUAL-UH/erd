 I am in desperate need of some casual (cost-efficient) socks of varying colors. Suggestions of where to find them online for a quick purchase? And am I looking for design? No design? And what colors? 




 [Winter to Spring Transition](http://i.imgur.com/gIFkcWR.jpg)

Don't know if it is too late to post my outfit. And noticed that it is dark so it is difficult to see color/detail. This is my first outfit post. Please help with suggestions/comments! 




 We went through this about a month ago. Fake as fake can be, my friend. 




 Tack, you are 39 on the leader board of Win % for players playing over 1,000 games. You are beyond great.  




 I think this is about as accurate as one could get. 




 Obviously, this is a subjective question. A lot of it depends on degree and many other factors. And there will surely be jokes of "100% winz lol!!1!" 


Nonetheless, at what number would you say someone has a **great** Win %?  




 A drive-thru liquor store. 

I guess it still helps waste your night away, just with a different product.  




 Yeah, I should have addressed that. I know that we are supposed to have separate shoes for each, but I want to be the exception (duh)! 

I won't do heavy athletics in them. I would simply wear them while at the gym doing light lifting/running. Likewise, I wouldn't wear them casually much at all, just when I need a dark shoe to compliment a particular outfit. 




 Here are the qualities I am looking for in the shoe:

* I don't want to spend more than $75.
* They need to be a dark color (preferably black).  
* Must have decent/good support.
* Must strike a perfect balance, allowing me to wear them to the gym for light running/weight lifting AND out on the town with a casual day-to-day outfit. 

Ideas? I've found these so far:

[**Puma ZDC82**](http://www.amazon.com/ZDC82-Peacoat-Black-Heritage-Trainers-UK/dp/B00DEENV5K/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1394861709 sr=8-2 keywords=puma+zdc) 









 Dude, you look great! 

Awesome job maintaining your fashion in spite of your disabilities! You are one that we can all look up to. None of us have a good enough excuse to just "not care." Thanks for the inspiration!  




 I am still not sure if we can take these tweets as confirmation that ACV is underway. Don't get me wrong, I do believe that ACV is well underway (if not nearing  completion), but these tweets say absolutely nothing about ACV.

Ashraf Ismail was the game director for ACIV. I highly doubt that he will be the head game director for ACV as well. Although I might be wrong. 




 Noted. Will stray away from that practice. Thanks for the input everyone. 




 BTW, I didn't just make up blazer sleeve rolling:

**[Example 2](http://images.asos.com/inv/Y/15/254/884667/Blue/image1xl.jpg)**

**[Example 3](http://i509.photobucket.com/albums/s332/CurtJWild/NavyBlazerChinos00003f.jpg)** 




 TL;DR - It'd look good if I changed the outfit? 




 Well, my sleeves are rolled because, obviously, I (mistakenly) thought it looked good. And because it's warmer here.  




 Fairly simple question. It'd normally go under Outfit Feedback, but those don't occur on Wednesday.

I am conflicted on whether or not this works as a good navy blazer. Thoughts?

Any other general comments concerning the outfit as a whole would be beneficial as well. Thank you for your help! 




 You make great points. And I think the majority of the discussion regarding other people's finances all has to do with percentages. I do understand that some people can buy a mansion like I can buy a Big Mac. I do understand that. 

But just because it is difficult to tell when night ends and day begins doesn't mean that we can't know it's midnight.

I think there is an amount of balance and wisdom in the equation. I am not to judge. And I don't really want to. It was just a personal observation and I am fully aware that I might be wrong.

*P.S. Love having the insightful conversation with you /u/BAMF_3.*  




 See, I think that is the very and only response that can be made. We all make judgments based off of what we see. A nice person won't make constant decisions to do mean things. Just as a selfless person wouldn't make regular decisions to be selfish. 

Actions help us determine character.  




 Great article! This is where I am at:

While the two shirts are uniquely different and, to be fair,  the two MFA uses are uniquely different, I do not see $450 worth of value ever making sense to just "get *exactly* what one wants. I think that is a prideful and abundantly selfish thing. Sure, you could argue that clothing and fashion is a selfish pursuit to begin with. But I think this is excessive 99% of the time.  




 Absolutely. Coming your way. 




 Hello friendly mods. I was told that this is where I post to join the Assassin ranks. I currently have 565 comment karma (yes, most of my karma is from our subreddit). Can I be a Milite!? 




 I feel like everyone on this thread just gathered together for a big group hug...and I'm not going to lie, it felt good.  




 Calm as a butterfly licking nectar from a common dandelion, my fiery friend.  




 *As did I. We will show him.* 




 Remember when you told me to go f*** off and die in another thread? Do you remember who you are mean to and who you are nice to? Or did you forget? 




 By the way, someone literally went through this entire post and downvoted everyone's comment. Who does that? 




 I think so too. I saw someone else say it and I have to agree, I am going to keep my hopes up until the 17th. If nothing has been revealed by then, I'll settle back down until E3 (still holding on to some hope it will be at a conference before then). 




 Make sure we are reporting the facts correctly. I don't think it is Ubisoft that has two big announcements tomorrow, I believe it is IGN per [this tweet](https://twitter.com/IGN/status/442407804939550720). 




 Newly released video footage of Evan Ebel in a 100 mph chase and shootout with Texas authorities on March 21, 2013. 

Things get real at the 6:00 minute mark, although the entire thing is full of tension. 









 The Genesis account is clear that representatives of all the *kinds* of land and air animals were brought to the ark ([Genesis 6:19-20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen+6%3A19-20 version=NIV)). This, for example, does not mean that there were two tigers and two lions, but that there were two feline kinds. 

If this true, the animals that survived the Flood would have had the genetic makeup to repopulate and create the current species that we have all around the world.

Animals do not have soul, but that does not mean that they are out of God's control. He is, after all, the Divine Creator. He has complete authority over all of creation, including animals. So yes, they are obeying God.

Scripture isn't clear on a localized flood although I think this is most fitting. The Flood would have covered the *known* world at the time, as the human author would have surely meant with his limited knowledge.

**TLDR:** If God is truly a miraculous God of which the Bible purports, He could surely do the miraculous to bring about a chain of events that preserve animals through and after the Flood. 




 That was significantly more mean than the first. 




 That was mean. 




 Don't know who deleted this but find it just silly since that is what all of today has been in this subreddit--an attempt to come up with believable rumors. 

Oh well, Darby liked it... 




 Do you know how to use correct punctuation? 

Anyways...your comments are what's making this worth it! 




 It's called time travel. Are you really that dense? 




 Nah. Actually, that is the pic I was in. Someone must have photoshopped me out. Weird.

I just met Darby at a creative writing conference. I had no clue that he would even be there. I freaked out when I saw him. We joked about recent Reddit hype. We talked about the future of Assassin's Creed. He let me in on some stuff. Just let me say, we will all be happy by the end of the week. 




 I live in the Line Islands, which just happen to be the earliest time zone in the world (UTC+14:00). We are literally at the exact same time as Hawaii, but a day ahead. Anyways...

Our island's Best Buy just released the artwork and cinematic trailer here. I don't want to ruin it for you guys. Let's just say...there's a new assassin!!! 




 Guys, honestly. I was on a cruise ship the other day and we were raided by pirates. No kidding. They swung on board screaming, "WE WANT YOUR BOOTY!" I freaked out. I had no clue what to do. So I did the only logical thing I could think of...

So when I abandoned ship and dove into the water I took a diving bell to get deep and far away from the booty snatchin' pirates. You're not going to believe what happened next...

After I punched the shark in the eye it swam away. I found another barrel, refreshed my oxygen supply, and continued to dive. Guess what happened...

I opened the treasure box that I found at the bottom of the ocean. I didn't even have to fumble with the latch, I just hit the box and it sprung open. Inside...Inside guys...there's no guessing this one so I'll just tell you...

A rolled up parchment. It read: *ACVREVEAL3414*

I have no clue what it means, just thought I should share. 




 Ender's Game is a fantastic book. It shows the brilliant potential of children and takes you into the mind of a genius. The cast of characters are dynamic and compelling. The story is riveting and well-rounded, easily accessible for many ages, backgrounds, and enjoyments. 

If you decide to continue the series, stay with the Ender's Saga (Speaker for the Dead) if you enjoy the intellectual/philosophical nature of Ender's Game. Move to the Bean Saga (Ender's Shadow) if you enjoyed the action sequences the most in Ender's Game. 




 They've commented numerous times that there will be an annual canonical release. [Here](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-director-defends-yearly-releases/1100-6391787/) you go.
 




 No one needs to relax. This is all part of the fun. We love Assassin's Creed. We love conspiracies. And we love hype. So...

Hop on the hype train. It's a lot of fun.
