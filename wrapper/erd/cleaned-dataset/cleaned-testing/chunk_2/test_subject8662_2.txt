 Some of the comments seem to indicate it's fairly new terminology.  




 Yeah, it's not the primary probability. We're mainly thinking it was exhaustion since it hadn't happened before or repeated. Also going to my PCP to run some tests to check for sleep disorders and the like.  




 The TR army grows stronger.  




 Hey I'm writing and answering it at work so no shame there. Thanks! 




 *insert physics joke that I'm not smart enough to make*
 




 Internet hug for you. I deal with some minor anxiety, but nothing major. I'm involved in theatre and I worked for my college's res life department so I know quite a few transsexuals and know that in the early years it can be tough. Hang in there and if you ever need to talk you can pm me.  




 I've actually been suicidal twice in my life, to the point of almost acting upon it. What's somewhat fucked up is what stops me is other people. I've always cared much more about the well being of others than my own, and I couldn't stand the idea of someone I love finding the body.

Also, though I'm straight I'm going to co opt this, the hope and assurance that it will get better gives me something to shoot for.  




 THERE WAS NO AARON 




 Much appreciated. I find it funny that I posted this just to start a discussion, saw the cake and realized what the day was, did a separate post to Karma Whore, and that's going no where.  




 Hey I kind of like it. Made for some good jokes between my friends if nothing else. The official diagnosis is Dysthymia with secondary presentation of a Major Depressive Disorder.  




 Which is one of the things that we're looking at. I haven't ever dissociated before that I'm aware of and no one close to me has reported any odd mood/personality shifts beyond the normal, but we are keeping that in mind.  




 It was the driving home that got me. If I had run someone over, would I have even known it? That sort of thing.  




 It does... quite a bit.  




 We can agree to disagree here, I'm not gonna argue about it anymore, I don't want a medical flame war. I would consider a disease with a secondary presentation one diagnosis and one treatment, as did my psychologist, but if you see it otherwise, cool.  




 I'm working my way up to exercising. Apathy is the major symptom at the moment and overcoming that will be the first big hurdle. So said because it's hard and I'm also really really fat.  




 It's just the wording. It is rather absurd. But you have to laugh about it, I learned that a while ago. If I hadn't developed my sense of humor, I probably wouldn't have made it.  




 I was diagnosed a little under a week ago. And I didn't realize today was cake day... 




 Freaked me out pretty good. Hasn't repeated since though.  




 I wish 




 In that I cannot be convicted for it, yes it is.  




 While I am that, it is not the clinical definition no.  




 It has cost me jobs in the past simply by me being too apathetic to get out and look, but at the moment, and I can't believe I'm saying this, I'm luckily broke as shit. I say that because I have two roomates and a dog depending on me, so even when I don't give a shit about taking care of myself, I'm beholden to them so I can drag myself up. 

But yes on a regular basis I cannot bring myself to do what should be basic tasks like getting up and going to class. I take 3 classes a week, I'm in my last semester, and when things were at their worst this year I was missing weeks at a time. 

The exhaustion may be linked to the depression mixed with working a full time job and commuting to school. I'm glad to only have 1 more month of this.  




 INCEPTION 




 Back at you. Taking things a step at a time to learn how to deal with it. Good luck with yours. 




 It's like you just kinda move to an acceptance that you're always going to be the eeyore of whatever group your in until you hit whatever bottom you need to to make you realize it doesnt have to be like that.  




 We'll see. I'm starting off on the lowest dose and will move up after about a month, and keep doing so as long as that's effective. 




 One of my roomates refers to it as my double potions class. Seems appropriate.  




 I can see your point, but just because those precise two words aren't, the condition is so it is a mental disorder that can be diagnosed, and the diagnosis can use a colloquial name.  




 You're absolutely right now that I'm rereading it. Either the psychologist told me the wrong thing or, more probably, I mixed up some of what he was telling me. Thank you for pointing that out, I'll get clarification on my next visit so I don't sound like an ass. 




 At the moment we're starting me off on prozac. We'll increase my dosage until I get to a point where it's not helping or I reach a degree of normalcy. The problem with Prozac is there can be side effects including the little general going permanently awol that may need to be taken care of with other meds, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

If I hit a wall with the Prozac, we'll look at moving me on to a more expensive cocktail of drugs but hopefully it won't come to that. Prozac is cheap and effective.  




 You should. As I said above, if you feel like somethings wrong, I cannot express enough ho important it is to see someone. It could just be that your stressed and overwhelmed, it could be that you have a chemical imbalance. Either way it's best to get a helping hand before anything becomes too much to handle. I let it get that far a couple of time and it almost ended really badly. 




 Thank you, well caught. 




 See my quadrupal depression reply 




 It's no problem. I can't stress enough the value and importance of seeking help. Sometimes it takes a while to find the right person, be it counselor, therapist, or psychologist, but it is worth taking the time to find the right fit. In the mean time, if you ever need, I'm here and r/depression is here to lend a sensitive ear whenever you need. 




 They do have different classifications for types of depression like any other illness. The one that I have just happens to be two different categories mixing together.

The thing with any mental health profession that most people don't realize is that a lot of it we still don't understand. We know what does and doesn't work in terms of treatment, but the why of it all, (i.e. why does the chemical imbalance start, why do certain medicines work) is still all in the very hypothetical at this point. 




 Thank you! I'm on stronger medication and things are starting to get better slowly. There are more bad days than good, but the fact that there are starting to be good days at all makes things a little easier to deal with.

 ... Yes it really really is. 

Double depression is dysthymia with secondary episodes of major depression. It's a clinical diagnosis. 




 No but it does come with a large sprite mixed with Holly Hunters tears. 




 It's fairly constant. The way my psychiatrist put it is, we all have good days and bad, but we mostly live at an emotional normal. A center line if you want to look at it like a graph. I'm constantly in the lower hemisphere of that and rarely if ever reach another persons emotional norm.

Put it another day. When an average person comes home after a long day; not necessarily terrible but not great either, and they're tired, somewhat fed up, and just want to lay down and rest? That's the happiest I feel with any amount of consistency. 

The depression itself I would say is worse because I have a fairly good support system that helps get me through. The worst thing though is feelings of complete helpless loneliness. I live with a roommate and their SO. They do what they can, but there's still a puzzle piece missing that neither can provide. At least not without causing a much larger amount of drama than it's worth. 




 A couple of minor things here and there, increased lethargy, ambivalence. The major one though was a few weeks ago I lost 10 hours. I work in a place where my day is split between two sites. I work in one for 7 hours, and another across the street for the last two. A few weeks ago I was gathering my things to leave at 7, and then woke up at 5 o'clock in my bed.

The fucked up part is I seemed to have functioned normally in the in between time. No one mentioned any abnormal behavior at work. I drove myself home, and actually made an appointment with a psychologist, so I must have known something was not right. 

We're not sure yet if that is related to the depression, if it was just extreme exhaustion, or if it's something else physical. More tests coming. 









 It's esentially when you have dysthmia mixed with a major depressive disorder. 

Dysthymia is the more common thing that most people will get at some point in their lives. It's minor and usually non recurring, but when it does recur, it can be overwhelming and crippling. When people say they feel trapped and can never feel happy, that's usually recurring Dysthymia. 

Double depression takes that and combines it with a major depressive disorder. Which has a quicker onset and greater initial impact. So when you mix the two together, it's like taking on someone else's heavy camping backpack while you're already lugging two armfuls of your own shit up a hill.
