 So I'm going to take an exam this afternoon that I haven't studied for. I'm pretty much resigned to the fact that I'm going to fail. What do you do when you take an exam you haven't studied for? 




 I would definitely suggest going back and trying to watch it again. It is intense...but worth watching!!  




 It's unclear whether it's genetic or not, but my family (from what I've been told) has a history of mental illness. I can't help but think that maybe without that, growing up would have been a lot easier.
