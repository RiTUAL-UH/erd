 I would suggest a curling wand. I have long hair and it works wonders for me. Some can be expensive, like between $100 and $200 but the one I have is ConAir brand and its right at the top of your price range. They can run for a lot more expensive than $40 so I thought it was a pretty good deal.

I suggest a wand because it doesn't have a clamp, so you don't get that annoying little kink at the end when you try to curl your hair. All you do is wrap your hair around it, hold it there for a bit, and let it go. It makes really tight curls or really bouncy beach waves depending on the size of the section you are wrapping. The bigger the section, the bigger the waves. 

Also, if it's your first time using it, be careful! It's really easy to burn yourself on it. 




 That dog is so cute! I know this isn't the point of your post, but could I get a better look at your tattoo? I kinda like tattoos...a lot. 




 That creepy smile.... 




 When I heard they were from La Crosse, I thought to myself, "Oh dear lord. I hope I know at least one of them." 




 this is really sad.
 




 The best part is the empty chip bag. 




 To me she looks like Kaley Cuoco, I don't know if I'm just crazy or what.
 




 Assuming you are referring to the Bible, I'm pretty sure that set of laws from Leviticus were for Jewish people before the time of Jesus. They are not Christian. 




 But if he said that, it would be interpreted as a pickup line and not a dig. He thought she was pregnant because she was *glowing,* not because he thought she was fat.  




 Smooth as fuck. 




 I came here to say exactly this. Upvote for you. 




 My brother and I are close in age, and my little sister is tall for her age and has abnormally large feet. I am 18 and she is 12 and her feet are almost bigger than mine.

Anyway, when we were kids, my mom always bought us all socks that looked almost identical, and we would all have screaming matches over whose socks we had. Pretty stupid. 




 I worked at this one fairly successful family-owned restaurant as a waitress where the two owners hardly ever hired men, made at least one waitress cry every day, treated the hispanic workers like shit, and where they discriminated against and harassed the pregnant women.

 It was the most stressful thing that I have ever had to do. At the time, I was 17 and I had school, but they were hesitant to work with my schedule. At first they gave me too many hours a week for me (about 28-30) and then they gave me too little hours (about 10). Also, there was one time where I worked a 12 hour day and got one 20 min break. I'm not entirely sure about the legality of that situation, but it certainly felt illegal. 

Also, if you made a mistake, the owners weren't afraid of yelling at you in front of the customers and they would also smack-talk you to the people sitting at your table. It once was so bad that the customers at my table actually stood up for me and told one of the owners that they were never coming back because of the way they treated their waitstaff. That day, the owner tried to fire me because of that situation. My only mistake was that the customer wanted pecan pancakes and I accidentally typed in regular pancakes. I almost let her fire me, but I needed the job and the tips could be great on a good day. 




 This is absolutely ridiculous. "What's the lasting effect on two young boys being sent to jail?" well what's the fucking effect of RAPE ON THE VICTIM.

Also, they made it sound like the fact that there was alcohol made it okay that she got raped.

And so many other things that I could just rant about 
 




 So that was terrifying.

 We broke up during our first couple months at college. I thought I was still in love with him then, and all I wanted to do was just talk to him. I wanted nothing more than to get back together with him. Then, later on he came to visit me the weekend before Thanksgiving break. We went to a party together, and I got drunk, but he didn't drink a single drop. By the time we got back, I was still a little tipsy. I got into bed, and he pulled out a condom and asked me if I wanted to have sex. Of course, drunk little test_subject8773 said yes. And it wasnt only the alcohol, I had genuine feelings for him. He had sex with me, finished in five minutes, then went to bed and hadnt touched me other than to put his dick in me. I asked if we could cuddle and maybe he could touch me a little and he told me that he was too tired and that cuddling would be uncomfortable and make him too hot. The next morning I asked if we were going to get back together, and he said "I dont know, my parents don't really like you all that much and I don't know if we should get serious again." Keep in mind, we lost our virginities to each other about a year and a half beforehand, and I was the only person he ever had sex with. That is still true today. It's not even like hes this big player who doesnt care about girls. He does. He just doesnt care about me. 




 "Kickin in the front seat, chillin in the back seat, gotta make my mind up, which seat can I take??" 




 Wow, this is awesome!
 




 Only child? 




 Do you have a link to that AMA? 




 Mmm. 




 why is a repost this blatant on the front page. 




 I just got goosebumps all over just watching that. ewewewewewew 




 wat 




 Did she have siblings? If she did, maybe she was verifying her own feelings about them. Maybe she feels that she doesn't love her sibling or wouldn't cry if they died.  




 Not gonna lie, this would scare the shit outta me every time I walked into the bathroom. Even if I were the owner. 




 What a motherfucker.
