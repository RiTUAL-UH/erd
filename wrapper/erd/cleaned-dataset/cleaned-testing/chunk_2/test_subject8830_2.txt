 Blitzball is hands down the best mini game in a Final Fantasy. Second the entire Gold Saucer from 7. If you ever get a chance to play 9 I do highly recommend it. It's quite different from all the others 




 I would have to say Final Fantasy 9. I am a big rpg fan and I remember playing it so much when I was younger. I've completed it several times. I would say the others ones from the sort of time (7, 8 and 10) are some of my favourite but for me nothing beats 9. The world, the characters who never seem to take themselves quite seriously and the little glimpse of what's to come when you see Garnets edilons when you first control her! 
Ahh the brilliant memories of playing tetra master...
