  Barkley: Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden! 

On November 28, 2012 Tales of Game's announced the game's sequel, The Magical Realms of Tr na ng: Escape from Necron 7  Revenge of Cuchulainn: The Official Game of the Movie  Chapter 2 of the Hoopz Barkley SaGa, with a Kickstarter campaign to help fund it. The campaign ended on December 28, 2012, and raised $120,335.

While the sequel will retain the original's self-aware tone, all of the artwork is being created from scratch to avoid copyright issues.

  also wouldn't be an old image that this reporter simply doesn't recognize. Ted Kord has only ever shared a single panel with this version of Booster Gold before -- in Futures End: Booster Gold. That issue saw Booster careening out of control through DC's Multiverse, before ending up "home" in the pre-Flashpoint DC Universe. The armored costume -- generally depicted with an A.R.G.U.S. emblem on it, although not here -- first appeared in the Justice League International Annual #1 in the New 52, meaning that Ted Kord was not a superhero and shared no history with Booster Gold when that look debuted.

It's likely that this Booster Gold is the same one who, in a different uniform, lent guidance and occasional surreptitious assitance to his younger self and his son Rip Hunter during Booster Gold Volume 2. That "Older Booster" was last seen just before Flashpoint during the Time Masters: Vanishing Point miniseries tied to the Return of Bruce Wayne event. That version of Booster would have been the one whose younger self worked extensively with Blue Beetle on the JLI and later the Justice League America.

Currently, the pair of old friends and former Justice Leaguers are working together in Justice League 3000...but that doesn't take place in the "regular" DC Universe, but instead in a similar universe where Keith Giffen and J.M. DeMatteis' humor-tinged, nostalgic take on the Justice League International is the standard. That world is a version of the pre-New 52 DC Universe, but one in which (among other things) Ralph Dibny isn't dead and Max Lord never went evil.



DC is a clusterfuck.
