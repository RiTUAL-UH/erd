 no, actually, but thanks for offering :)  I've been writing songs since middle school.  I'm in grad school now, though not for music.  I write   sing pop rock / alternative. 




 and I'm always happy to help a fellow student.  btw, I was curious, did you write the poem/lyrics?   If so, do you write songs too? 




 no problem; I was a little bashful to record it here in my dorm, even though I sing in here everyday :) 




 ok; here it is; I hope it helps! https://soundcloud.com/test_subject8889/sets/poem-recording-for-vocoder-in-5-parts 




 ok, I'm singing it btw.  I've recorded the first three parts, but in the last part, on the 4th and 5th lines, you have the repeated "the" at the end of the 4th line and the beginning of the 5th line.  So would you like it on the 4th or 5th line, because that affects the rhythm also.  thanks :) 




 oh, wow; I didn't notice it was two links.  sorry about that :) 




 Idk if you're still looking for recordings, but if so, where is the text of the poem? 




 I actually pulled it up yesterday.   I just opened more threads in more tabs than I could read yesterday. 




 Didn't find out about this until starting Grad school.  Used to do all the searching myself. :/

 thanks for the reminder.  My AP Music Theory teacher in HS told us about it, but I had since forgotten 




 Do you mean New York blended with North Carolina? 




 Raised in south by parents from the north.  so I would say my accent is neutrally American.  




 I grew up in the south, but my whole family is from NY (deets here http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7)

So, in the south they say I have a neutral accent, but in the north they say its southern.

But I do not say y'all.  I have always said "you guys" 




 same, just within America, and with Spanish  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7 




 Yeah, sometimes accents are clearcut and sometimes they are not so strong and are percieved differently by different groups; I would assume that is based on the comparison with their own accents.  I have a similar situation http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7 




 I was raised bilingual (English and Spanish).  I learned French in HS, but apparently I speak French with a Spanish accent.   




 I don't live on a border, but I know exactly what that's like: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7 




 This is actually a complicated question for me.

I grew up in the American South (North Carolina to be specific), but my parents grew up in New York (and we regularly visited the rest of the family up there).  So I learned to talk around ex New Yorkers.

So, in NC anyways, everyone says I have a neutral accent; after I give speeches, sometimes people tell me they like the sound of my voice.  So yeah.

One time though, my cousin, from Brooklyn, while in Brooklyn, said that I have a "thick southern accent;" and I told her that she has no idea what that is.  There are people in my town that I cannot understand a word they say, but I digress.

So to my relatives in NY, I have some degree of a southern accent.
In the actual south, where I am from, I have a neutral accent. 

I am currently studying in the UK.  I have a clearly American accent.  

Also, to complicate it more, I am hispanic; my parents are fluent, but given ESL, I have been gradually learning that I have been pronouncing some words in a spanish way. (like Acetominophen (Tylenol) is, in English, pronounced Ah See Toe Min Uh Fen, and I had been saying, Ah Ceh Toh Mean Oh Fen, as that was the only way I'd ever head it said, by my parents).

TL; DR:  Raised in NC by ex NY-ers; accent sounds neutral to southerners but sounds southern to northerners, with some spanish elements mixed in

 I don't read romance novels on principle, but I have a high amount of respect for John Green as a writer.  These are certainly more than just romance stories, tackling lots of complex issues.

Given that, I still have not read TFIOS because I am avoiding the disappointment I felt after reading Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants when it was so popular and I was in middle school. 

I had jumped on that bandwagon, and the ending just rubbed me the wrong way so much.  I would have rathered she dated the counselor or never slept with him at all.  

I know the gist of TFIOS, and have read the first chapter or so as an excerpt somewhere, but I don't think I want to read it and be disappointed by the inevitable tragedy or "oblivion" within.   




 I've never seen any of that either...maybe I'm just lucky too. 




 That some colleges have math course requirements to get in if you're transferring from community college.  So if you took AP's, make sure to follow up that admissions received your AP score report, because it gets delivered to a different record keeping department by default, so if admissions never sees it, you will not be shown as meeting the course requirements to get in, so you will be denied.   And if you go to the school to point out your APs and ask them to fix it, they will say its too late and just tell you to come back next year.

Sorry about the run-on; its past midnight and idc

Source: this happened to me, so I went to a school online (Southern New Hampshire University) and finished in just one more year.  I am now in grad school studying abroad. 




 here's the thing though; we were told this so much in high school.  BUT, if you're taking AP courses and dual-enrolled in college courses while in high school, and participating in clubs as well, when you do go to college it will be so much easier. 

They drilled into us how college is so much harder, and I am in grad school now and have only had one course that was in any way harder than my high school courses, and not really, I just didn't try.  

The pressure to succeed and the workload is triple for a high school junior or senior with APs and Extra Curriculars than it is for a college student.

Disclosure: My degrees are in Criminal Justice and Forensic Psychology; and the graduate program I am in is Political Science.
(These majors involve more essays than tests).

Second disclosure: I am the kind of person who doesn't study.  But I take extensive notes.  The act of writing something down makes me remember it.  




 Well I made it to the end of the first semester of Grad school before that happened to me... 




 some schools have a policy that you cannot check out a book from the library if it is a required textbook for a course you are enrolled in. 




 I was raised bilingual (english and spanish) , and I just realized this last year 




 I heard the same story from my French teacher in high school. 




 well we already know you're against it :)

But in all seriousness, neither Israel nor Palestine would want to give up territory to Hamas and allow them to form a "legitimate" state.

Palestine might be more willing to compromise on that, given that Hamas is already involved in their government, but I don't think Israel would be willing to make that concession.  




 "whoa oh I, could have done better than a girl like you." 




 Didn't "Yesterday"  start out as "scrambled eggs, ooh baby how I love your legs?" 




 "can you go on hold?  I have to call in an expert." 




 "yay; new additions for your rock collection!" 




 "This is a delicious burger; thanks"
"No problem"
"and thanks for disposing of that dead raccoon for me; It was stinking up my driveway. I know you were tried from your shift at the restaurant."
"speaking of which" 




 "aww; what a cute baby! How old is he/she?" 




 "don't you have an interview in an hour?" 




 "...my baby, she's up for anything I wanna do.  If it's on TV or ever in a magazine, she can take a fantasy and make it a reality..." 




 "If I never see your face again, I don't mind, cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight." 




 "Want to play a game?" 




 love the flair 




 "so can I buy this boat with your credit card?"
