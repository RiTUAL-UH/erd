 Fucking radical. 




 That's some expert level photoshopping right there. 




 I recommend nachos always, for everything. 




 And dancing midgets. Can't forget the dancing midgets. 




 The correct meteorological term is "fallstreak hole." 




 amazing railgun  
  
Sounds like a tagline for a sideshow exhibit: "Come one, come all! It's the Amazing Railgun! Come see the splendiferously superb sailors of the US Navy and their ravingly reckless railgun!"

 3 pointer! 




 Poop while you sleep! It saves precious minutes you would have otherwise wasted pooping while you were conscious. 




 You gave "Pony Mario" an M rating? That must mean that's not a horn sticking out of the pony's head. 




 Don't gild me either. 




 Y'all got anymore of that gold? 




 Vodka.  
  
I take a bottle of vodka, open it, and pour it into a glass. I can get wasted on it at lunch time and go back into work without a really strong smell of booze on my breath.  




 All this time... I thought I was alone. Thank you, sister/brother.  




 That's a lot of silent letters. 




 No one tell them about this. Ever. Please. 




 No way, this has to be shopped. 




 Plot twist: Gordon Lightfoot is Bryan Cranston's older brother and Neil Patrick Harris' father. 




 Peanut butter on hamburgers, peanut butter in ramen, peanut butter on fired eggs, peanut butter and mayonnaise sandwiches... I love peanut butter. 




 Reminds me of the [monkey Jesus](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/22/article-2400354-1B46E378000005DC-437_634x478.jpg) fiasco in Spain. 




 There is NOTHING shitty about peanut butter. EVER. You hear me? You could spread PB on a turd and I would happily eat it. 




 I liked having a tall locker. The smaller ones were hard to get into if the dude below you was fucking around in theirs. I once had a small locker (a bottom one), and the person who had the locker above mine left a sandwich in theirs throughout the Christmas break. The smell of rotten salami and mayonnaise made its way into my locker and stayed there for the rest of the year. The few articles of clothing I left behind over the break smelled, my gym shoes smelled (and not like my sweaty feet), and worst of all my text books smelled. I had to throw out everything except the text books, because I couldn't just replace those --they were way too expensive. I used those text books for the rest of the year, even though they stunk up every classroom they entered.  
  
TL;DR - don't rent a small locker. 




 Take it easy, buuuuuuuuuuuuuud-day. 




 They have an entire YouTube channel dedicated to videos of them fucking with their poor father. No wonder the man is angry. 




 Robin Hood reincarnated? 




 Good job? 




 Never work, live forever. Seems legit. 




 their father was holding them and farting on their nipples since birth.  
  
Is that some sort of weird pedo fetish? 




 How do you plan on fulfilling your sexual desires? Is this an open relationship? 




 This picture might look cool, but remember that during his reign this man was responsible for the spread of Wahhabism and the torture and oppression of his own citizens.

 What a dick. 




 Do people post things like this solely for the internet's entertainment? 




 Did anyone else expect something more like [this](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view2/1358756/lighting-fart-on-fire-o.gif) when they clicked on the post? 




 i.e. It is known  
  
i.e. No, it's not. 




 Good. 




 I meant ice hockey, not field hockey.

 Are you sure this isn't just [a scene from Ghost Rider?](http://i.imgur.com/QmD9jIU.jpg) 




 Women's underwear were much larger before they started trimming their you-know-whats. 




 Or you can just leave the gif open and it will play over and over.

 I don't think Miss Britain's uniform is accurate, unless they've recently made "triple corporal" a rank in their military. 




 Did your landlord happen to do something to piss you off? 




 For shibble, my homeman. 




 And Benedict Cumberbatch as "4chan." 




 "Doing stuff = cost  
It's that simple  
Pay up"

 China sure has some colourful water. 




 In less than 100 words, what is the meaning of life? 




 People still say "wicked?" 

















































 I just had a sausage and a glass of milk for lunch.

Update: Thanks for the questions, folks! It's been a great AMA, but I have to get back to relaxing. 









































































































































































 I'm thinking of hanging up my video game skates and never bothering with another EA NHL game again. I know I can just mute people or ignore their messages, but it still makes me uncomfortable knowing that that I'm playing against this kind of people. 




 I've lived in the Halifax area for the last two years and in the Maritimes all my life. I've never seen a June bug outside of the May-June (sometimes early July) timeframe that they come out. Did anyone else see any June bugs recently? 




 DAE? Amirite?
