 Wonder what that statement was? 

I'm abusive?

...

I'm a terrorist?

...

I'm a misogynist?
 









 Or worse, the beef patty? 









 Yes, and what if the entrance was surrounded by anti-gun protestors yelling at you to reconsider your decision, for fear someone might die, and holding huge posters with dead people killed by bullets?  














 After the mass shooting in the theater there that killed Jonathan Blunk, 26, Alexander J. Boik, 18, Jesse Childress, 29, Gordon Cowden, 51, Jessica Ghawi, 24, John Larimer, 27, Matt McQuinn, 27, Micayla Medek, 23, Veronica Moser-Sullivan, 6, Alex Sullivan, 27, Alexander C. Teves, 24, and Rebecca Wingo, 31, I'm shocked we haven't seen Open Carry overturned. Here's hoping this little nitwit just wrote that history with his actions; prediction: Open Carry will be overturned in Colorado.  



















 MUSKEGON TOWNSHIP, MI --  The 27-year-old Muskegon Township man who was nearly naked and reportedly high on acid when he allegedly discharged his gun outside a pizza business on Saturday, with three kids in tow, has been arraigned on four misdemeanor charges.

...


Engle had three children with him  ages 6, 4 and 3  when police said he stood outside the pizza business wearing only a towel and pounding on the glass windows of the business until one shattered. His .40 caliber semi-automatic handgun went off in the process, damaging the casing on the business door. 









 In Florida all jobs require you have an assault record And weapon.  




 Someone find it!! 




 I remember the anti-poverty campaigns of the 70's and early 80's. And it seems our poverty problem is much worse this time around - it's going to take a massive shift in the perception of public opinion. But I'd argue the true public opinion is to help thy neighbor. It's just when people are manipulated into thinking that fixing the poverty problem is somehow giving people a free lotto ticket. It's just a fucked marketing campaign of the Paul Ryan austerity types, sitting pretty and calling out hate speech against the worst-off among us.  




 Go outside so I can play Deep Purple and enjoy my Rollie.  









 I don't understand why the cops didn't hang around and patrol around the park if there are "bad guys" living nearby. Their answer is that kids can't use the park, not that they will keep an eye out for the creepers? What the fuck is wrong with America right now?? GAWD.  














 Gotta wonder if they took a history class in their short education experience. Did they go to school at all??  














 I get the sense that Joffrey is also considered inbred and flawed - is that not the case? It seems he's evil because he is genetically jacked.  




 More death, more death, more death. Wonder no more! 



















 There should be a number similar to 911 that people could forward threatening texts to in the case that they know the aggressor is armed, or potentially armed. Something that could immediately send out an emergency alert like an Amber Alert to the area. (A Red Alert?) 



















 As we saw in the Santa Barbara massacre, the parents tried to warn cops but they needed access to his home. Now, a law is being passed so that concern IS the justifiable cause. This may help. 

I always hear that people don't want laws because law abiding citizens follow them and criminals don't. However, if we make selling a handgun without a background check illegal, all that does is put the good guys on notice to run background checks to ensure they aren't selling to a bad guy - which happens! Felons buy guns without background checks right now. One way or another we need that to end. If a GGWAG is selling in a private transaction and runs a background check and the buyer is a felon, the GGWAG has just potentially saved lives. I'll never get why someone who is supposedly a good guy gun owner would be against that.  



















 Background checks aren't required on all gun sales. It's one of the big issues for gun safety advocates right now.  




 It's come out that the majority of mass shootings have been done by people who have illegally obtained guns. It seems to ME that anyone pro-gun with half a brain would agree that background checks and registration would make their own gun ownership safer and more protected, because it could stop many of these massacres that make so many people afraid of gun owners. What's your take on this? Why not require background checks and registration of every firearm? 









 This is one of the best pieces I've read on the gun plague, especially interesting about her own personal connection to firearms via her father. Worth a read, y'all 
























 Mr. Milleas wife, Krista Millea, is also listed as a plaintiff in the suit. She was eight months pregnant at the time of the crash and, the suit says, suffered in the absence of her husband.

Ugh. Here's hoping this lawsuit forces a reversal of the recently-loosened regulations on truckers and hours / safety.  



















 If that belligerent dog doesn't recognize the honor of the badge, that's his problem! /s 














 The comparison was retrieved from thin air.  
























 Could you tell a dickish lion from a friendly one? That's the real talent!  









 Yes! And your employer is a Mormon so no transfusions for you! Wheeeee

Wake the fuck up. Praise no one.   




 It could be seen as precedent for allowing such refusal but it's my understanding that another court case would need to be brought to find out for sure.  




 Cool. So when your kid is sick and needs a blood transfusion and then you find out the owner of your corporation - who has never said anything about religion to you - refuses to cover it because it's against his faith...well, just get another job, dummy! It's not his problem 




 After they gave Dubbya the presidency, he have them the fanatics in order to deliver rulings like this. I agree and I call for SCOTUS term limits in the face of these extremists.  




 Fuck you  




 My sentiments exactly. Take the power away from employers.  




 Furious. I think we need term limits so these old fucks don't get to camp out for decades ruining the lives of Americans.  




 Fuck that. Welcome to sharia law  



















 Just have to say, as a ginger with light lashes, I love that you rock the light lashes naturally. Whoohoooo

 Funny thing is, those calling themselves "conservative" are actually fanatically radical. The progressives are the true conservatives today - economically, ecologically and socially.  




 He's after a Presidential hummer.  




 Hurr durr drunk driving should be legal Burp because only criminals would break laws right?  




 Thank goodness. Fuck the NRA.  









 You mean the media outlets that pounded the drumbeat for war when Cheney wanted to invade? The ones that berated the occupy wall street folks? Why would you ever tune in to that shit. GO seek independent media. Http://www.Democracynow.org is one, PRI, and occasionally the BBc.  




 Quiet people are shy 




 Yeah. Let's get rid of drunk driving and molestation laws too. After all, people break them, so why have laws at all? WHEEEEEEE
