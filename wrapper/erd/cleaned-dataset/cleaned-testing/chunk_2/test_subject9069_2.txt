 This is the abridged version. Originally she gave a three minute monologue on the nature of seeing, how the eyes are a window to the soul, and how great it would be if they were somewhere where it was snowing instead.

 Shame he couldn't have costarred with Dane Cook on the episode about him ripping off CK too. It could have been a big get together of CK copiers.

 Newsradio. It seemed like a perfect balance of personalities that kept you from getting bored by any of the subplots. Even as broad as the performances and writing got, they stayed likable to me.  




 A badly directed movie is likely to miss deadlines and go over budget.

No [William Dickson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6b0wpBTR1s) for some reason, but still a bunch of unfamiliar names and faces in it.  









 I like that Rarity's not blushing in embarrassment or anything. She's just pissed.  




 Enter The Void certainly has some memorably lit scenes that I like, but many people will probably just think they're tacky as hell if not headache inducing.  




 I'd wait for this to happen a couple times before leaping to that conclusion. Maybe he just wasn't in a chatty mood for a change. 




 I like to imagine she did something to make the lasers visible like blowing dust, popped her foreleg tendons, limbered up, bent down, and then just stood up and just barged right through the lasers to set them all off.

 Oh man, they have so many drinking games for it. Those pony mudflaps for their 18-wheelers. It's all good.  




 So what are we talking here? Like he possesses some pony or drags one away into the smoke (we later see he or she is fine cause it's a kid's show?) 









 I'll be honest, I don't really like that shot in RfaD. It kinda comes out of nowhere, has no impact on anything else in her story, and so on.  




 http://listverse.com/2014/09/18/10-of-the-worst-plagiarists-in-history/

I guess ones like Shakespeare aren't in there because the author would consider them the "best plagiarists" or something.  




 You must not have actually read it. 

"Tusk has a lot going for it. Michael Parks has a knack for making Smiths overwritten speeches sound like prose-poems, and Smith doesnt squander that assethe lets Howes long, winding stories anchor the movie. And that Mr. Tusk costume is genuinely horrific, with bloody scars and a general ungainliness that makes the Wallace-walrus look like hes in excruciating discomfort. (Theres a scene about three-quarters of the way through Tusk where Howe forces the man-beast to learn how to swim, and the combination of Wallaces panic and what he finds beneath the water is as terrifying as anything a veteran horror director couldve staged.) Tusk also has some subtle touches that speak to Smiths personality"

I mean, come on! 



















 Why in the world did I get more karma than you when my bit of snark was based on a false impression? 




 As a projectionist, my reaction would be "No, LYNCH! YOU ARE NOT MY FRIEND!" Then I'd crumple up the message.

 I was just curious what times before modern history its recorded that one nation heard another one had a natural disaster or something and sent workers, resources, or soldiers to charitably restore order (instead of as some cover for a military invasion.) 

Thank you for your time.   









 Oh, so you murder a few children and suddenly no one cares about the rest of your life!  




 The sad part was that Derpy didn't even use The Force there.  




 Now clearly she should have treated herself to a front row seat.  




 I'm surprised so many people don't know that Rarity is Jewish. After all her original name was Rariwitz.  




 Usually they mean the marketing was either underfunded or the trailer and promotional images were designed to give an inaccurate impression of the movie. Often this means that a satirical movie like Punisher: War Zone is marketed in a way that gives the impression it's played completely straight, then you see it and it plays its action and story for laughs.

 I just visited /r/creepy and all the top-rated posts are from imgur, none give the artist credit. There were credits for the artists in the comments, but obviously only a fraction of the people that will click the link will check out that. I've done this rehosting stuff too, but I always try to cite where I got it from. Why do so many people upvote links that don't give credit?  




 I am bored shitless by there being black   white morality in movies and kids should be taught that villains and heroes are so easily divided in real life. 




 That's not the source. SCP doesn't create original images, just takes them from wherever online without attribution.  




 Source please.  




 Like, when Youtube shows an eleven, twenty, or forty minute ad, clearly that's way likely going to be skipped through instead of the fifteen second ad. Does it reward the channel at all if the viewer is willing to watch/let the full ad play out on a seperate tab?  









 That model? Alberta Einstein.  




 The reason you guys like these fucking overposted stories so much is that they're so short even your tiny attention spans can deal with them.   




 So, where'd you spend the last few weeks away from /r/funny?  




 Because Vonnegut loved the film adaptation Slaughterhouse Five, possibly.

 This does not apply to me at all. I've flagged down cops and stuff. But then, I live in a suburb where I wasn't taught that cops are Satan.

 SomeOrdinaryGamers is terrible. Their readings are boring, their analysis is dull both in the sense they rarely have anything halfway interesting to say and their conclusions are sometimes stupid too because they want to be liked.

 Does someone need to watch the entire video or just the ad to get the full revenue from it?  




 Unforgivable! No biscuits or anything!  









 Like I said, Retsupurae does it a lot. Plus X channel may have way more subscribers than you would if you decided to just start your own and there can be significant cross-promotion.  














 I just saw Retsupurae's latest video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-OWaeBpqh8 and hearing that they had a fan that captured the initial video for them made me wonder who here has done that for a channel with a bigger fandom than theirs or whom has that done for them. How did it work out?  




 When I opened my eyes in that cabin and I felt the straps on my arms, legs, and across my torso holding me fast to the bed with a tarp beneath me, you better believe I was praying to God for help. It was a one-room building with paneled walls and a musty smell. I must have been where whoever brought me there was sure no one could hear anything that would happen. In the far upper corners there were ceiling mounted cameras aimed at me, red lights on. Along the far wall there was a table with a green plastic sheet over it. There were the tips of instrument handles visible on the table. 

I struggled against the restraints, barely able to move my hands and feet. I screamed and struggled for what had to be at least a minute. I stopped only at the sight of the door opening.

A man stood in the doorway. He was six feet tall at least, fit as an ox, and a little bored. He wore a surgical apron. When I saw that, I began screaming again. He didnt respond as I alternately begged him for mercy and threatened him. He went over to a laptop the cameras were connected to and made some adjustments. He walked over to my side then.

Shut up! he yelled at me, his tone more annoyed and exhausted than angry. I complied.

Okay, checking, checking, audio test, he said. He went back to the laptop and played back what hed just recorded. After a nod of satisfaction, he picked up a piece of paper from next to the laptop. He looked from the paper to me as he read.

Hello from the husband you fucked along with her, he read robotically. 

E-Ellen? I said weakly. Is this about Ellen? But she said that- He looked up at me and I stopped speaking again. He shook his head slightly and continued.

Did the bitch even tell you about me? Are you still hoping youre gonna escape? You still thinking the man who strapped you down is just gonna scare you? Ive seen too much of you with her to ever let you live. Youre gonna die really slowly. Were are gonna watch everything. Youre not the first other man to stick his cock in her but you will be the last. He sighed, crumpled up the paper, and tossed it on one of the tables as he made for the instruments hed laid out.

Without so much as another glance at my face, he came over to me with a scalpel. He spread my largest and second toe on my left foot, and began to cut the webbing. I had never experienced anything like that before and showed no strength in the face of it. I shrieked like an animal.

Make him stop, I thought. Please God, make him stop.

He seemed finished with my left foot and made for my right hand. I tried to clench it into a fist but that did nothing to slow him down. He went for the flesh between my ring and pinkie finger and began to cut. I was dimly aware of mucus touching my lips as I tried to scream.

He stopped after an eternity and stepped back, breathing heavily. I faintly heard the sound of him peeling off his gloves. I begged him to not to continue while he got on two replacement pairs of gloves without acknowledging what I had to say.

He came back to me with a surgical retractor in one hand and the scalpel in the other. He grabbed a section of my lip below the nose in the retractor and pulled it. He pressed the blade of the scalpel against my lip and began to cut.

I couldnt take any more. I hoped hed forgive me.

Medulla! I screeched as loud as I could. Immediately he stopped. He went back to the table hed kept his instruments on.

Okay, hang in there, Joe. Itll be over soon! Ive got the tetracaine ready! Almost immediately after he took away the pain, he got out the kit to give me the stitches. While he was doing that, I actually fell asleep from sheer exhaustion. 

*	*	*

So now Im at our home. Hes downstairs doing the laundry, insisting on doing all the chores now. I dont think Ill be able to walk properly for a few days, but we have our story for how I got injured like this for our coworkers. He has all the written and video evidence he would need to show that it was consensual and that he respected the safety word in case I decide to go to the police or anything. Not that I would do that. 

He told me he was more than satisfied with what wed done. He really liked the little bit Id come up with about Ellen. Thats left me pretty satisfied too. Anything for him. I love him so much. I should have let him go farther. Next time Im sure I will. It wont be for some time of course. 

He's got a partner that will let him live out his fantasies. He didn't dare tell any of his old lovers about this fetish. He didn't hesitate to stop when I said the word. He loves me.

I know this goes far beyond a normal S M relationship, but it doesnt matter. He's never going to do this to anyone else. Not to someone who doesn't know the safety word. He's definitely never going to just keep going until I can't say the word. He loves me.

I haven't just given him a taste. I haven't made him want to go farther so much he won't be able to stop next time. He loves me. Hes not going to cut anyone else. Please God, hes not.

Please, oh please God.

 No, it's really mostly obvious bullshit. Accomplishments and skills do not make people [inherently happier](http://www.nj.com/parenting/index.ssf/2014/08/post_42.html) so your pie in the sky hopes that all you have to do is get a job with specialized skills or a promotion so you can fuck someone and its all better. That metaphor of how being a "nice person" is useless is obviously Pargin justifying his own and other people's dickishness based on professional desirability. Creating stuff often doesn't "increase your value as a human being" most of the time because many of us don't have the means to make our products do anything or share them with significant numbers of people or have a significant impact on those we can reach.    

I think people are overly impressed by this article because he isn't offering easy answers, but he's still offering simple answers that aren't true. Read his article about stuff you don't learn in school and he blatantly admits in there that he lucked into the position at Cracked that compels anyone to pay attention to him.  




 i.e. "Model wants to pander to nerds, asks which member of a local camera crew if they know someone with a room like this, goes and does shoot there."  









 I often deflect mockery by saying "In 70 years, what I'm doing will be retro!"  




 I've had this idea for the past few days and I wanted to know what you guys around here would think of it. I don't know if it would benefit from actually being shot like a silent film. 

The premise would be that some modern equivalent to Charlie Chaplin's Tramp character would be in a zombie outbreak, more or less going about his usual business by basically dodging zombie hordes through a series of improvised setups and gymnastic abilities. One day he runs into a female survivalist who is the last of her group. He becomes smitten with her and imagines her as a delicate flower despite her in reality being tough and completely uninterested in him except for he knows how to get where she wants to go safely. As they make their way there, she insists on killing zombies (sometimes gratuitously) but he is completely abhorrent of the idea, arguing that some day they might be cured. 

That's all I've got in mind for the story right now. I just wanted to see the reaction around here to it.

 I didn't want to mess around with it but from what I thought you just undo the bolts on either side, but then you have the chain and all that in the way so I wanted to make sure I don't charge into it and cause expensive damage. So what's the procedure to avoid doing so?   









 I have no idea whether this will help, but apparently Jan endorsed it on one of his videos. In light of his recent claims that the C   D might have come from a legal firm that represented Hasbro instead of Big H itself, apparently there's a bit of hope this will be sorted out in a positive way for Jan. Maybe not.
