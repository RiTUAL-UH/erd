 We made it to the table of 32. But still... HAIL SOUTHERN 




 [Next year we get the Cure Bowl in Orlando against an AAC team](http://curebowl.com)

The fifth bid starting in 2016 is actually gonna be on a rotational basis between a handful of conferences.  




 Sun Belt gets a fourth bowl bid next year, and a fifth after that. But Georgia Southern and CrApp State will be eligible so Texas might miss out again. :P 




 Yeah Georgia Southern is just buried in that article. :( 




 Lol Georgia Southern went 9-3 in their first season in the FBS and came within a score of beating both our ACC opponents this season. We ain't no cupcake team. 




 Aww sorry Sam Houston Bro. :( We are taking good care of him! 




 HAIL SOUTHERN :) 




 LOL I never thought about it that way but you are right. :) 









 Ooh that's neat! I like the buddy ticket idea. I'm sad you can't sit on the hill anymore though. :( 




 I work for UA Museums. Love it!  




 When I was at Georgia Southern (I graduated in '12) the football games were free if you paid your athletic fee (about 150? but it included other things like renovation costs and the rec center access too).

I work for the University of Alabama and they run a fac/staff season ticket lottery based on seniority. You have to buy the whole season. 




 Why not State of Georgia University Panthers? 




 [Here this friendly PSA should clear up any confusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=putYM15zC0Y feature=youtu.be) 




 [NO](http://mylolface.com/assets/faces/angry-no.jpg) 




 I get so sad that people still get confused by this. :( 




 Overall an exemplary season for the Panthers. They do a good job keeping Paulson North warm for us. 




 Hey they did their best to only win by one point. Don't be too hard on em. 




 Awesome. That makes me happy. 




 GSU AD actually reached out to the NCAA about doing it. Betcha can guess what those bastards said. :( 




 NCAA- Not Controlling Athletics Association /s 




 Kleinlein is a stand up guy. 









 All of them. The answer is all of them. 




 I bet someone down Auburn way might take him. ;) 




 I'm glad we could help you guys reach 15,006 average attendance.
 




 OK I'm gonna use Alabama, because I work there. [They had eight players drafted in 2014](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Alabama_Crimson_Tide_players_in_the_NFL_draft).

Their starting kicker, Cade Foster, was not among them. He is now a free agent. 

Players like that, who don't get drafted yet expected to. What kind of a future can they look forward to? What's the likelihood they will get picked up? Do they have skills they can fall back on if not? I'm legitimately concerned. The graduation - employment rate is low enough as it is. I should know I am a (gainfully employed!) recent anthropology grad. :) 




 If their coaches are not properly educating their players about what a long shot it is (about 3% according to the NCAA website, but that's across all divisions) then they are doing those kids a disservice. I'd really like to know what happens to the kid who stakes all his hopes on getting into the NFL and prepared for no other option. What does he do? Flip burgers? 




 Yeah but they're not all gonna get drafted.
 




 I enjoyed the analysis of this article and I'd like to see the data from other Universities. I feel like this should all be public information for any public institution. 




 I always implore our defense to squish 'em, but I never claimed to not be weird. 




 GREATEST THING 




 Georgia Southern was the first team to be undefeated in conference/outright champs in the first year of transition since the rule was made. 

Still sad panda. :( 




 I read somewhere that ODU wasn't eligible either because of transition. 




 I think you got down votes because most Georgia Southern Fans don't think very highly of UGA even though we can't really be considered football 'rivals.' A lot of it goes way back to when Erk Russell left UGA to start our program. Some of it has to do with how hard they fought to block us becoming a University as well. We like Tech though. 




 HAIL SOUTHERN 




 YES 




 Yes, that is also a good one because it shows us being classy in our celebrations. 




 So we should change it to mountain goats, or what? 




 LOL @ CrApp State Sheep and Sad Georgia State ball. :)

 I would attend this game.

However wouldn't Georgia Southern get in trouble? :( 




 The difference is Georgia Southern went 8-0 in conference play and holds an outright championship.

EDIT TO ADD- And we are the first team to have done so since the rule was implemented. 




 Almost like they are rewarding certain conferences for having an actual championship game... Hmmm ;) 




 Those boys are not giving up... LOVE IT GO JACKETS 




 This happens with cameramen inexperienced with the Option
 




 He didn't learn it at Southern....he just coached it there first

aight 




 Truth. Although that game made me sad face. 




 I believe we face both your flairs next season :) 




 Gators. 




 Everyone in here like 'WOO GT's OFFENSE' but CPJ learned it at Georgia Southern 




 Samesies 




 No passing, no problem budday 




 OK Drink get nekkid 




 Time to WRECK THE NOLES
