 Looks like you forgot to list Steam in the pic. 














 Vendor: Can I help you sir?
Me: Yes, I'll take a Big Dick and a Fuck Cunt please.
Vendor: That'll be $2 please.
Me (thinking in mind): Why haven't I come here before for this stuff? 









 My brothers and I still play Wrestlemania 2000 over No Mercy.  For some reason that game just stuck with us better. 




 Looks, good, but I think it would be better if she would have dressed up as Samus! 




 I was looking for Leo walking in the background. 




 The Cubs actually win the world series in BTTF.  That's who you need to bet on in 2015. 














 So um, how did it taste when it was ready? 









 The best I've ever found that was thrown out was a PS3 controller.  It needed taken apart and cleaned up, but it works just fine! 




 Good lord it's the loch ness monster!! 




 I was thinking the same thing in regards to people saying it's a relatives first meme. 



















 Haha, good one! 









 I always hope for this to happen when I get a friend request out of nowhere.  Never does though. 









 So apparently black clothes was the choice for the picture.  Looks like Will didn't get the memo. 




 And that means a lot more coming at the end of the year as opposed to the beginning. 




 At least the comic doesn't tell them about the arrow to the knee.  That could ruin the entire game for someone! 









 She could probably get the abortion at Costco. 



















 Doc, I think we've hit 88 mph! 




 But since this is random just for the sole fact that Ellemeno pointed out that is should be random, does that make this random pic relevant? 




 That's a start! 









 I agree on overhand on being the correct way too.  But it can vary per person. 









 And here all these years I thought you were supposed to bend backwards when playing limbo. 




 Holy crap, I had to do a double take with the picture.  My parents have a setup almost identicle to this one.  Except, they actually did put up a christmas tree in a different spot. 



















 That selection looks about right. 




 Why would you stop in the first place if it's only going to make you mad that you have to wait on a person crossing the road?  And it was your own choice. 




 When I was in college cars would stop on a regular basis and they were the LAST car going by.  Doing this only made things take longer for me walking and the driver. 




 I lost mine about a year ago.  GGG kept the cash for himself as a reward, but was kind enough to return everything else at least. 




 Oh, I get it. [Filmsy](http://www.filmsy.com/) 




 And then goes to the bar! 




 You could hang out a lot in freshly stacked haystacks with people who need hay... 




 Although I have never seen or read any of the Harry Potter's, I still find this pretty amusing. 




 SIMPSONS DID IT....er wait, different episode. 




 I see what a person is doing when paying a homeless person like this.  But lets say someone paid a homeless person $5 just to do this.  To justify that money you would have to be gone for more than $5 worth of parking in that spot. 




 A ticket pulls in more money than an extra $.50 in a parking meter is probably the main reason. 




 Since a little over 10 years have passed already , you actually only have just a hair over 12 years left to wait.  That time will fly by! 




 Ah, I guess I missed the really small one above the plate before.  I'd say it's small anough it shouldn't count anyhow. 




 Watching 6 movies with only 5 screens.  Wizardry? 




 They're going to get neck cramps looking up like that the whole time. 




 So why is he questioning his answer yes? 




 Makes me think of Wrestlemania 2000 on the N64. The game came out in 1999, but it lets you input dates for when you win a belt back to something like 1955.

 




 6 months?  So did Easter get moved back, or Christmas moved up? 




 I believe the blu ray release that is coming out next year for the 30th anniversary is putting the guns back in again. 




 So no one washes their face with soap?  Because when you do that you're also cleaning your eyebrows in the process.  Unless I've been fooling myself this whole time. 




 So where do I place my order? 




 My plan was to buy the book from the store and use it until the last day for full refunds.  Then order the book through the library and use that copy for free the rest of the quarter. 




 Problem 4 on page 87 has been changed.  Because of that, wecan't use the previous version anymore. 




 I kind of feel like I have a connection with each of you just because I work at Ohio State!! 




 She must be an avid Portal player!
