 In my country (Poland) where mech keyboards are not popular, Razer is quite easy available. I bought it as it was for ~100$ when buying any other would be around 200$ (120$ + 40-50$ (shipping) + duty charge (20-30$) = around 200$).

So Razer was quite good choice considering situation. I own black widow tournament edition (love tkl), and now I'm considering buying Shine 3 TKL with browns.

It's polish portal similar to reddit, a guy with nick "noisy" asked somebody to ordered 2 pizzas to [Oawa](https://goo.gl/maps/6JWSz) offering 10k in Dogecoins.
A guy "SharpNieSharp" took a challenge and ordered them, a special ask was to write "Dogecoin" on a box.
Pierogi (dumplings) was an extra thing - personal choice of SharpNieSharp.



Edit: If you need any translation - just ask (exam tomorrow so I will do anything apart from studying).  




 Is that setup sponsored by Razer and Pepsi? 




 I thought it would be cheaper to sell whole keyboard and buy new switches - then I looked at prices per switch... 




 Why do you want to save pieces (switches as I suppose), is it better to clean it (without desoldering) and sell? And use that money to spend on new one?

 Do you also wrap it up and send it to yourself - few days of that feeling "Is today going to be THAT day?" 




 Let's start with ***"640K ought to be enough for anybody."*** - Bill Gates, not true at all - sorry folks.  














 If you tried and didn't fall in love, lucky you - that shit is expensive, but in my opinion worth it. 




 Try mechanical - never go back... 




 Sorry for not changing system language or trying to make it English-readable. Top is "Birthday are celebrating by:" and buttons are "Send birthday wishes".

As a extra info - Polish is one of hardest to learn language - If you have any questions I will glad to answer them.

 Painful is to see it reposted X time...  




 I see 12z (it is about 4$), so

A) It doesn't work

B)Not yet has spreaded through play store

C)It is region limited promotion 









 Uff... you didn't find it. This is just a hoodie that I get as a mobile dev, so it is just a promo, if you expected a viral Nokia clothes commercial - sorry to disappoint you, not that time.





There is nothing in the background. 




 She laughed, otherwise it wouldn't be here. So don't think of me as that bad person. 




 I got it as a mobile dev and she really liked it, plus I'm into Android, so I wasn't regretting it. 




 I recommend to watch that: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyTEKhkB8OM#t=86

one of his commercials. 









 I was as well afraid but I gave it a shot... and it totally worked - she was just angry that I didn't crop out the background, but not such things I have seen on reddit.

That is awesome collection of ergonomic keyboards! 




 What are your personal feeling on cherry mx clear? Asking from curiosity as I'm more then happy with blue. 




 Can you write something more about how they work (comparing to 'normal' keys)? 
Is there any 3d model of a universal keyboard key or did you do it by yourself?
Awesome idea!
