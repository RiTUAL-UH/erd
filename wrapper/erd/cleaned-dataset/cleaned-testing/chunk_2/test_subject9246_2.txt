 I'm not good at showing emotions so I just ate them and said how great they were.   




 My sister thinks I'm going through a phase and am crazy, yet at the same time she is one of my supporters.  




 Exactly. My parents keep vegetarian burgers, lasagnas, etc in the freezer for when I come home to visit. It's nice then even though I don't live with them, they want to make sure I have quick and easy access to food when I'm around.  




 I've been a fish eating vegetarian (pescatarian) for about 10 months now and the hardest part is family gatherings especially around holidays. Today is my family's Christmas get together and for Christmas we do a lot of finger foods: meatballs, ham rollups, veggies, etc. One of my favorite foods are my mom's ham rollups. I could easily eat a whole platter. I have never asked my family to change their recipes or make special accomodations for me - it's never been an issue finding something to munch on. Well today as we are setting the table, I notice something different, my mom made vegetarian ham rollups. Instead of wrapping the pickle and cream cheese spread in ham, she wrapped them in a spinach leaf. They tasted so good, even some of my meat eating family were snacking on them, I actually had to make sure I got some because the regular ham rollups were being ignored. 

This small gesture meant a lot to me, and I just wanted to share with you how awesome my mom is.  




 Inconceivable!  




 I'm sorry. I suppose I have some pretty understanding friends/family. I've received some grief from meat eaters, but I tend to brush it off and move on. I also found not mentioning it helps. Many of my friends don't even realize I'm pescatarian. Got to be stealthy. ;)  




 I'm pescatarian and it makes it easier. Make fish or order fish at a restaurant is easier than ordering vegetarian or vegan. My family loves that I'm not full out vegetarian because they can cook one meal everyone will eat.

 Do you still need six and seven? 




 I know the feeling. I actually deleted my Facebook a couple months ago and it was the best thing for me. 
I've gotten closer with my few close friends, I've stopped worrying about what is going on in the lives of people who I used to know and comparing them to myself. I've even had some old friends reach out through phone calls and texts to see what's new in my life. The things I would want to post and sometimes did post, I now turn to my friends about and they've been a lot more helpful than I'd ever imagine.  




 As a Stephen King fan, I am super jealous. I own maybe ten of his books, but my goal is to have a Stephen King bookshelf one day. Thanks for sharing. :)  




 You are correct. Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, but a dietician requires school, internship, and then an exam to become certified.

 I will. Thank you!  




 Thank you. 




 Thank you for sharing what you went through. It's nice to know others have gone through the same thing. 

I've started searching for a good psychiatrist near me. 

Funny you should mention reading. Growing up I'd escape inside a book daily, but with school and work I haven't found time lately. Well last night I pushed everything aside and read just a few chapters of a non school related book. I've missed that.  




 I've contemplated driving recklessly into a tree. 




 To me up north was always the UP. 




 Mt pleasant is not up north....is it? 




 That's why I generally resort to saying "I'm tired" or "I'm stressed"
 




 True, I wouldn't want to put someone through that.  




 Thank you so much for taking the time to respond to all my questions. It really means a lot. :) 




 I've gone to the free services on campus before, but they don't really know how to deal with things like this. You get x amount of free visits and they are more for homesickness, help adjusting to college, balancing work and school, and various things like that. Their advice to me was "get involved on campus" and you'll feel better. Not really helpful in my case. :/  




 Thank you. I'm not ready to give up yet.  




 Getting hit by a car is another one that crosses my mind sometimes.  




 Have you had any negative side effects from taking GABA? 

Thank you for sharing what worked for you. :)  




 Same here.  




 Couldn't have said it better myself.  




 I work out when I can, could probably do it more often though. 

Slightly afraid of AD side effects, but also against the idea of them in general 
- I don't like taking medication in general.
