 The whole concept of a neg doesn't fucking work. If someone told me I was ugly, would you seriously expect me to start taking off my clothes and exposing myself? No, I'd run and hide and never have sex again.  




 I think there are a huge number of men who are attracted to shy women.  




 Would people in this thread like to answer their own questions? It could make things quite interesting. 




 "What are the signs that a girl likes a guy?"

Bi-weekly at least. 




 Can we sidebar something like this? I see these threads at least once a week, from both genders in both subreddits, and the answers are always the same - followed by 'just go for it and ask him/her already.' 




 Can someone translate this please? 




 I tend to find that the 'spark' doesn't appear until you are comfortable with the person - particularly when you're actually going out. If you asked him out (I assume he'll say yes) and both of you relax, you will have a lot more fun together. The awkwardness will disappear when he doesn't feel he constantly has to impress you (which he does if he likes you).

Also, the 'chemistry' mentioned in movies can be exaggerated, and is better labelled as 'having fun in their company.' Expecting some strange and magical feeling of love at first sight to suddenly strike you down is quite simply not going to happen. 




 Maybe he's one of the 64 




 bend over backwards for them

Well there's your problem. Sorry mate, but you're about to hear some harsh truths. 

You're a *nice guy* - otherwise referred to as the most unattractive object in the world. Sorry. There's an excellent guide to helping you in r/askwomen or something, and I'll link you to it when I'm not on my phone, unless somebody helpful will do it for me. 

Basically you're coming across totally wrong - in your desire to not be a loser, you're making yourself even more so. Rather than conveying 'a sensitive, caring guy who just wants love,' you're putting across 'needy, possibly obsessive, and high maintenance with very low self-esteem.'

they say I'll find somebody

Can you please elaborate more on the conversation leading up to this? It will help us dissect what you're saying wrong. 

I have no doubt that you're a great guy with a lot to offer a girl - and you *need* to believe this too - but the way you're conveying yourself is unfortunately of a weak, needy... loser.  




 I would hope so, seeing as they're married.

 The fuck? Since when was violin less cool than flute? And I'm pretty sure even professional musicians who are male flautists still get ridiculed. 

I played Trombone in high school. If I hadn't also been able to sing my dorkness would have been over 9000.  




 Well, the person who stole it does.  




 If you want him, you need to put in some effort and step outside your comfort zone. It's as simple as that.  




 r/seduction would have an apoplexy if the guy gave a girl his number. But I think it builds a bit of trust and makes you look less like yore just trying to get in her pants. Opinions, anybody? 




 There's such an emphasis on males upholding this side of a relationship - he must always tell you you're beautiful, that you look nice, etc. etc. or he's not worth being with - but it never goes both ways. 




 Well laaa di dah  




 Or that something has gone wrong.  




 Dolce et decorum est 




 I don't think there should be conscription for anyone, but I think we can have gender equality long before we have world peace, so I'm working on achievable goals.  




 I didn't say I was *right*. 




 While I am all for feminism, this has always irritated me. You can't seriously expect women to have an equal place to men in society when we can be forced to kill and to die, and you can't.  




 So by that maths, Afghanistan has -1 health care systems? 




 I'm a historian, and I don't agree.  




 If you did the cover a long time ago, how can you be a new player/singer? 




 I suppose at 18 I'm not really old enough to say 'I know how you feel,' but I'm going to anyway.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I always try to be outgoing, happy and fun, I have numerous friends (mostly female, in fact) in several circles who think I'm funny and good company, I go well out of my way to ensure people around me are happy. I dress as well as I can afford (thank you MFA), I always try to be polite, and I don't think I'm stupid. I'm a paid, professional singer, and I can play guitar. I have no problems approaching girls and talking to them, and I don't think I'm boring - even so, I've studied r/socialskills intently. Sounds good on paper, right?

Wrong. 

I have always been the third wheel, for my entire life. I had one girlfriend for two months, who seriously fucked me over emotionally and then cheated on me with some sixteen year old cunt. My friends and hers (who are no longer her friends) all agree that I did everything perfectly - was understanding, supportive, romantic; in one girl's words "the perfect boyfriend." Besides her, not a single girl has ever shown interest in me, and whenever I try to initiate - which I do on a DAILY basis - they always make it more than clear that they're not interested. I've joined clubs and pursued hobbies, I've taken ballroom dancing classes, am involved in more musical ensembles than is healthy for my sanity. I go out drinking/dancing/clubbing; every person in the group will hook up with someone - except me. It doesn't matter. I meet so many people, and I'm friends with most of them almost instantly, but NONE of them ever display any interest in me beyond that. 

I've concluded that I'm ugly, which makes me a little sad, because there's nothing I can do about it (besides plastic surgery - fuck that shit), so I'm stuck being lonely for the rest of my life. 

P.S. I don't whinge about the 'friendzone' because that attitude is pathetic, but when a girl you really like refers to you as her Gay Best Friend it stings.  




 Am I the only person in the world that finds something to talk about, and doesn't just say 'hey'? 




 Quiet... drama girl? Quiet drama people exist? 




 Or where he fits in Kara!

 Don't feel like you should *have* to kiss etc, as if it's not a real relationship without it. If you're comfortable just being with each other, so much the better.  




 Being in a relationship is just like being really good friends, but with sex. If you're not having sex yet (totally understandable at her age, and it's important not to pressure her) then you don't even need to worry about that. Hang out, go to movies and shit, do whatever you would normally with other friends. Don't have sexual contact with anyone besides her. There is an implicit emotional connection; you will probably be her go-to person for emotional support, and likewise. 

The bottom line: have fun. It should be about opportunities, not duties.  




 Shirts three sizes too big on girls are EXTREMELY flattering.  




 Wait, so the baby had down's syndrome, was fathered by an ex boyfriend, who was the daddy?

Or the girl had down's syndrome and her dad, who was not only her ex but also a baby, was wailing in the car? 




 Dude. She's talking about sex stories with you. Clear sign that (to quote Superbad) she wants your dick, in and around her mouth. 

All you have to do now is make a move and go get some! 




 If you approach him, it will make his day. His week. His life. 

He's probably beating himself up about not having the confidence to approach you, but if you give him a lead in he'll most likely gain a ton of it. And it'll put a smile on his face for a month. 

EDIT: if what you're saying about the looking and looking away is true, then he likes you. No doubt. This is a classic for shy guys.  




 Can I ask why he is being downvoted? I make these kind of jokes all the time - especially when girls are talking about girl things, like waxing their legs etc - and they're great for a quick laugh.

And the bottom line of social skills is that once you've shared a joke with someone your relationship with them will never be the same. It's the oldest form of connection (besides probably sex) in human history.  




 By 'went back to his place' I'm assuming you mean you slept with him - in which case, if he doesn't contact you and does a hit  amp; quit, then he's a dickhead and not worth being with anyway. If he's not, he will!

EDIT: I have absolutely no problems with her sleeping with anyone, it just affects the situation.  




 I think she's using 'stalk' lightheartedly. I certainly do when talking about Facebook, and I hear it constantly from other people.  




 With notable exceptions on both sides, I find particularly attractive people to be less giving in all walks of life. Not that they're unkind, but less attractive people are more likely to go well out of their way for other people, because unfortunately they have to.  




 I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. SIT THE FUCK DOWN AND WRITE PART 2. NOW.

AND PART 3, AND PART 4, AND PART 5. 




 You said that everybody has left and there is nobody in your town like you - this is a bit of a defeatist attitude and not be done lightly, but have you considered leaving too?

EDIT: As an artsy person who found great happiness in the big smoke 




 I really loved this comment, but how does it relate to kissing? 




 I've need seen it used in a sentence, so perhaps the Supine is just the 'dictionary' form of the Participle? 




 What if another rocket fails and they don't want us to know? 




 I'm currently doing Latin at University, and we learned (just last week actually) that the Participle is derived from the Supine form, but the Supine is still used as the Principal Part. That's from the Cambridge Latin textbook.  




 That's the next line of the song.  




 Coz papa's gonna be bringing' home the... gingerbread! 




 Latin verbs have four principle parts - the Present Indicative Active, Present Infinitive, Perfect Indicative Active, and Supine. 

I can see how this relates to English, but I've never heard our words organized in this way. Is it used in teaching the language? 




 I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with the term 'Venetian Blonde.' This may because Venice is on the other side of the world from Australia.  




 Can you imagine the world before that song? CHAOS.  




 Aussies unite. Our chicks are by far the best. 

Which is my excuse for why I still miss her.  




 Gingers are orange.  




 Yeah the PM gives them all a bad name 




 ... the pub? 




 
Running their fingers through my ginger beard? 




 As someone who is familiar with Principal Parts in other languages but not English, can you please explain how they function in this language? I am fascinated. I didn't know we had them.  




 Yeah, this thread was not a good move.  




 I waltz over and talk to girls all the time, and they do think it's weird. They think I'm eccentric as hell. Which is probably true. 

But they also think I'm fun, outgoing, and confident - which equals attractive.  




 We are making some progress. 

I said a bang, bang, bangity bang, I said a bang bang bangity bang.  




 I can only assume this is what they did. 




 Getting called gay when you're clearly not is a compliment? ... this changes everything.  




 To be fair, Romans were always in sex mode. 

One of the duties of the Censors (an elected position) was to prevent celibacy. Yes, conservative Christians and Texan sexual educators, you heard that right. PREVENT.  




 I would like to point out that not all guys find confidence attractive. It doesn't change a single thing for me, and I would almost prefer a quiet shy girl (albeit one who is still attractive) to an overtly confident girl.  




 Yes, bikinis are major factor. But the whole salty hair, warm   tanned skin, and general fun atmosphere of the beach makes it a particularly sexy place.  




 Here's the secret: you actually look really sexy at the beach, just in a totally different way.
