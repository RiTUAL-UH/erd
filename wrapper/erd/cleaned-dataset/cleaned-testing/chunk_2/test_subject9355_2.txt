 I'm so sorry to hear this, how old were you?  




 Theres an instrumental by Danny Elfman called 'Finale' used in the film Kingdom, gets me everytime. 




 People like to say they hate it because other people say they hate it. Its really quirky! 




 8tracks.com is a great website   app, basically people upload there own playlists and tag them by genre, theme ect
