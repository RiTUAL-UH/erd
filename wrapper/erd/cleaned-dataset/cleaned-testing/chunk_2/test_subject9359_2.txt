 ill be your friend  




 thank you for the advice and support. i do want to be with him for as long as possible in my life because i love him loads. he supports my problems as i take antidepressants as well but I've never had a decrease in libido. i will talk to him about a sex therapist. we can think about exploring new things to do. i do get quite upset when he can't make me orgasm but that is rare. i give him direction in what i like but i think the problem is also that he hasn't tried anything in terms of sexual experience and experiments. i have in the past done sex acts outside of the bedroom and in the public but he hasn't so that is something we can do together. maybe get a new sex toy purchase.   




 that is the dose that works for him but not sexually. i think he's going to try and lower it and take something else as well so he doesn't feel as bad  




 are you being sarcastic?  




 i have talked to him about it. I've told him various times recently and in the past I'm thinking about leaving him. i told him yesterday i was thinking about cheating on him. it made him cry.  




 i know how you feel. i am angry all the time. everything annoys me. my body aches. i get fatigued. 

keep venting. keep talking.  




 i dont recall the one that he took at the time  




 he said he will go on different antidepressants  




 i havent  




 i told him it was making me unhappy
