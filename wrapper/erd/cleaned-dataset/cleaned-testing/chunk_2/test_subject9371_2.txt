 For someone's TDEE to be 1200 is a very rare occurrence.

[This calculator](http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/) says your TDEE is 1,422 calories a day. [This one](http://scoobysworkshop.com/calorie-calculator/) says 1,525. Your dietitian knows what she's talking about, ~~unlike mine who seems to only want me to suffer~~.
