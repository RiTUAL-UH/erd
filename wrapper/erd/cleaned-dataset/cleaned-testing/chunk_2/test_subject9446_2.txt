 *GASP*  It always eventually gets back to one!!  I'm SO telling all my friends about this... 




 Farmville will do that to you... 




 I eventually stopped playing the classical guitar because I just couldn't put up with the nails any longer...

I hated getting odd looks from girls and having to smile and reply, "Oh, it's okay, I play the guitar"

	int n, length, i;
	char buffer[256];
	bzero( buffer,256);
	
	// Get data from socket, replace line feed with null
	n = read(connfd, buffer, 255);
	if (n  0) error("ERROR reading from socket");

	length = strlen(buffer);
	for (i = 0; i  length; i++) {
		if (buffer[i] == '\n') {
			buffer[i] = '\0';
		}
	}

 I was homeschooled K-12.  My last two years of high school I dual-enrolled at a community college.  This enabled me to transfer in as a sophomore right out of highschool.  I got my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering in 3 years, and I my Master's in Computer Networking in 4, all with a 3.75+ GPA.

Thanks Mom and Dad for homeschooling me! 









 Damn, I want to know if it hit the boy or not!  There's a split second where the camera loses the soda-rocket (pop-rocket if you're from up North), and I can't tell if it hits the kid or if he manages to evade it.

Frustrating. 




 Exactly.  It depends on the type of pictures.  In most cases, no...but we should have a look just to be sure. 




 Get Ye Flask.

This is my favorite thing to say to bartenders. 




 I'd be in charge of setting up LAN parties to train and instruct the younger generation in the art of zombie warfare.
My curriculum would consist of the L4D series, and the Resident Evil series.
Allowed ages would be 10-17.  Sign up your kids now, before it's too late... 




 It's perfectly normal for girls to appreciate and enjoy this type of game play.  There's no reason to assume this makes you a lesbian in any way. 




 It's also for Computer Engineers.  I'm a CPE and a member at my local university.

It's kind of like a high school chess club...except all the nerds are 3-4 years older. 




 I'm just down the road at NCSU...

 Whoever said giving is better than receiving was full of crap...

This is way cooler. 




 Wait, Micheal Jackson died?? 




 The internet has really made me appreciate my siblings more.  Sure we'd have our occasional spats, but nothing remotely as devastating as this... 




 What's worse than the holocaust?  Half a worm in your apple... 




 I could be out partying with my friends, but instead I'm here with you guys.  Virtual parties ftw... 




 I believe [General Patton](http://thinkexist.com/quotation/the_object_of_war_is_not_to_die_for_your_country/206600.html) can be credited with that quote. 




 Hey Reddit,
My community holds a "Senior Breakfast" for the elderly folk in the area a couple times every year.  For the next one, I've been asked to do some form of humorous entertainment (nothing too lengthy maybe 5-10min).  Now I've done some standup before, but not with this specific demographic as my audience.  So my question is, what do you think the seniors today would find funny?

Feel free to recommend specific jokes, online resources, etc.  Your thoughts are much appreciated! 




 Now with double-fisting action... 




 Apparently the swine flu was brought about by pigs with excess appendages.  Oh the horror!!
