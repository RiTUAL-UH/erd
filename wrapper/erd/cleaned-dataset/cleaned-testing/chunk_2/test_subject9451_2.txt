 I'm literally the only person in my family who isn't an addict of some sort, which has made me an outcast. If I want to spend time with my family, even if it's breakfast, drinking is involved. They drink and drive like it's a normal part of life. I've seen my parents loose everything, a large fortune, homes, 6 vehicles and have to move back in with my grandparents...but they kept drinking. Once at lunch I suggested my sister shouldn't be drinking and driving with my new born (3 weeks old) baby nephew in the car, and she told me to mind my business and she can do whatever the fuck she wants, then got a drink TO GO. 
Also, I grew up in a very physically, emotionally and sexually abusive household. I can never forget the things that happened. 

TL; DR:  my refusal to condone my family's lifestyle choices, and my mistreatment as a child and a teen. 




 As scary as potentially losing your ring is, that's pretty awesome!!! Nothing says progress like an item that used to fit comfortably flying off. Congratulations on your progress!!! 




 That's a good idea, I'll start looking for races in my area! I really thought I could run the whole thing but now I see that's not such a great idea. I live in Southern Louisiana so I'm sure I can run the whole Mardin Grass 5k next year, maybe more! 




 That's great advice! I can't imagine how nervous I'll be on race day, but I will try to remember to take it all in and document my time. And ill try to remember to take my time and walk if i need to. I really thought if i tried hard enough i could run the whole thing but I admit my expectations were a little unrealistic.  I've always dreamed of being a runner, so hopefully this will be my first of many races! Thank you for the advice!  




 Thank you for the concern and advice! I'm actually surprised to hear the program takes 9 weeks. For some reason I thought if I trained hard enough I could run the whole thing. Now it seems like that will lead to an injury that would take me out of the race all together. Thanks again!  




 This past summer I joined a boxing gym and fell in love with working out. I was going 3-5 times a week, started to get in great shape and felt better about myself than I ever had. But then I got injured and took some time off  from the gym. Immediately following that, I went on vacation for a week and did zero work outs. I came home with a terrible sunburn and sun poisoning, which kept me out for another week. I ended up being out for over a month. That was July, and I'm still struggling to get back into a routine, I can hardly manage getting to the gym once a week now. I've also gained weight, and I'm not 10 lbs higher than my original start weight! This is what hurts most. I worked so hard and it's all disappeared. My plan at the beginning of the year was to look better for this holiday season than I did the last. I just got married in February and wore a size 16 dress. My new goal is to be at a size 10 for my 1 year anniversary. 
The thing is, it's not even just about looks and dress sizes. Heart disease and diabetes runs on both sides of my family. I want to be healthy enough to live a long, fulfilling life with my husband and raise a family. 

To help cure myself of this, I just singed up for my first 5k. It's not much but I've never ran that far before. Given that I paid the entry fee, I'm hoping it will light a fire under me and get me back into a solid training routine. I'm so nervous but at the same time I havnt stopped smiling since I registered.

God, I hope this doesn't blow up in my face. I'm so tired of failing and starting over again.



EDIT: structure and spelling. 
EDIT 2: only a few people have commented so far but I just love how supportive this community is! Thank you all for the encouragement and advice!  




 Battlestar Galactia reboot. I can't count the number of times I've re watched it. 




 Dude, really? Is that entirely necessary?  




 Unfortunately this is completely normal here in the US 




 I'm just a socially awkward person, still new to reddit and asking a question. Didn't mean to bring down the quality of content, I was referred to another sub that is more fitting.  




 Didn't know about this subreddit! Thanks for the link, hopefully I can learn a thing or two. 




 Don't forget to hold hands and look both ways

 I never even enrolled into college mostly because I wasn't willing to go so far into debt when I know I could learn through autodidacticism. I realized I was into graphic design, so I got a job as a personal assistant to a designer and ended up doing a lot of her work. With that experience I was able to get a great job as a graphic designer and have been there for 2 years. Meanwhile, I take online classes at my leisure. I get certificates of completion if I pass the class, which I can use on my resume. 

I do sometimes regret not getting the college experience and wonder what I missed out on learning wise, but overall I have no regrets. Hard lessons learned are not easily forgotten. 


For those interested: I use edx.com and courseusa.com to take classes. The ones I take are free by choice, but you can pay for the class to get a validated certificate and credits. I'm currently taking an epidemiology class from professors at Penn State,  and  soon i am starting an advanced astronomy class.

 Do you carry them all the time even when you're not on your period?

Yes, and not just for myself but for any fellow ladies who happen to be without one in a time of need. I would give me greatest enemy a tampon if she needed one.
NEVER deny a woman a tampon.
