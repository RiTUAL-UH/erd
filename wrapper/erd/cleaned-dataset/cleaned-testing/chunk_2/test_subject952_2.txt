 Yaaaay i love them! 




 Jade Sueta. Ill help you out and play with ya. 




 Now i am since i clicked the link. 




 Well, Allegiant would be rated R, because of the sex, but the other movies should be okay i think 




 And they don't mention Marcus at all in the trailer and that worries me. 




 The trailer makes it look like this is a love story. Sure, she is in love with Tobias, but it looks like they take out the action. That one sneak peak we get with the cheesy music is part of the love story. I hope it more action than love in the real movie 




 Haha shovelface i l o l ed 




 I thought the Hunger Games was about what Suzanne Collins thinks of reality tv.... That it is so stupid where people enjoy watching kids kill each other. 




 I hope its not the next hunger games. I loved the books, and Catching Fire was great, but SOOO many people havent read the book. I want Divergent to be popular to where only people who have read the book see the movie even though that eill never happen :P 




 Jade sueta is my name. I have a mic 




 Jade Sueta. Ill be on tomorrow 




 What does that do? 









 Relevant username  




 When Ezra was A. 




 Why?

 As you can read from the title it says that i want to go to the End. I currently have a mic but dont use it often. Anyone can join, you dont need a mic but i prefer one. I will be on for multiple hours today if anyone wants to beat the ender dragon with me. GT: Jade Sueta 




 Ill play. gT: Jade Sueta 




 Jade sueta is my gamertag 




 How will you speak too that H-o-o-o-o-rse. WHAT DOES THE FOX SAY 




 I really hope its not and that ezra just found the lair. But yes, it showed it right there, so i think its Ezra 




 Have you written anything yet?  




 I don't know if this is bad or good..... 




 Stapling water to a tree. Not everything is possible, people!!! 




 Jade Sueta is the name, im happy to play the game! 




 I might be on tomorrow. GT: Jade Sueta 




 I can see why people think that, since that is what they grow up with. A tv show I don't like that is old is Lizzy Mcguier or however you say her name. A tv show I don't like now is Dog with a blog. That is teaching kids that animals can speak because then they will try to talk to their dog like they are a human and annoy the shit out of their parents. But who doesn't like sponge bob???? 




 Please be under the age of sixteen  




 Yeah what's your user?
