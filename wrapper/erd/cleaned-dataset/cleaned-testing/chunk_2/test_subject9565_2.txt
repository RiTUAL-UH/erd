 Hope so, I'm a new fan of her work. Who knew she could sing 




 Cuz she is amazing slash she was in Frozen and her show Veronica Mars got cancelled but Kickstarter brought it back to life into movie form thanks to the fans.  




 Should I delete it and repost in March?  




 Sorry! But keep on watching, I just got into the series recently. It's so good! 




 Yes 




 **My 5 Questions:**

1. One word to describe the feeling you felt when you got to portray Veronica Mars once again? 
2. Veronica Mars is known for causing trouble, what was the worst thing you have ever done when you were in high school? 
3. Out of all the mystery twists such as (Aaron Echollos being the murder of Lilly Kane, Cassidy being the school bus killer, Logan's friend being the rapist in Season 3, the TA killing the dean etc) which one shocked you the most?
4. Veronica Mars had so many guest stars that were not well known when the show was airing, but are well known now such as Jessica Chastain, Paul Rudd, Melissa Leo, Jane Lynch, Michael Cera, Aaron Paul just to name a few. Is there a guest star that was featured on the show that you would love to work with again?
5. If you could take one thing from the Veronica Movie set what would it be and why?

 If you plan on being sexually active use a condom at least. This situation could of been somewhat prevented. You should find a way for her to use the pregnancy test because you both need to discus your options if she is.  




 I would tell your gf before she finds out  




 American Hustle was labelled as a comedy as well which it was not. 




 I don't have friends who like movies as much as I do. But whenever I go see a movie with my friends we discuss the movie for a little bit. The acting, plot and is it worth watching again. You know its a good movie if you can't stop talking about it with your friends I also search on IMDB because my hearing isn't so great I want to know the characters names and more about the film if I really enjoy it 




 V for Vendetta is one of my favourite movies. It's dark and is full of mysteries. I think it's a great movie much different than the other movies listed. Superhero movies are mostly for entertainment, but if you have the right writers and the right cast and director like Nolan for the Dark Knight Trilogly then you're set. 




 Maybe get her a stuff animal that says feel better sounds corny but every girl likes a stuff animal  




 I saw Her a few weeks ago and I really liked it. I thought the storyline was a unique love story that we haven't seen before. Congrats on the Golden Globe win, what was the hardest scene to shoot? 




 I only needed to read the header to know that your SO is not good, I would get out of the relationship as quick as you can.

 So I saw Blue Jasmine the other day and this is sadly the first Woody Allen movie I've seen. Cate Blanchett was out of this world. It was so good, I highly recommended it. What's your view on Blue Jasmine and what other Woody Allen movie should I see? 




 This guy is a douche.  




 It sucked what happened, but you got him back really good. But I hope your okay 




 At the end of the day it's up to you, but I say be a friend or keep your distance because that is a huge gap and its very noticeable when the girl is still in high school and where you are at the age where people have gradauted post-secondary school already. 




 I would talk to the police and I would tell your parents. This ''friend of yours'' looks like a ticking time bomb.  




 I know what you are going through. I've been hearing impaired all my life, I have been wearing hearing aids since I was 3 years old and I'm 20. Don't let your hearing disability define who you are. It sucks not being able to hear everything, I had friends tell me never never mind after I told them to repeat it but I told them please stop saying that. I just ask them to repeat it, if the laughing continues be straight up honest with them how you feel they are your friends, you are young and so are you friends, they don't realize what your going to and your probably their first friend with a hearing disability. You should tell them how you feel. And ignore those girls who called you ugly, its not worth your time  




 I don't know if you have mentioned it, but what was the cause of death? 




 I'm 20, never been in a relationship. Been on a few dates but never went anywhere. Had my first kiss a week before my 19 bday. It sucks trust me, but just wait you never know what will come your way 




 I have not been diagnosed with anything, but if this feeling continues I am going to go to the doctor. I've been really down on myself and the only thing that kind of cheers my mood is watching movies/tv shows. Anyways, I'm 20 years old, I got a friends mutual friends etc but I only tell like a few what is actually going on in my life. My dad cancer gotten worse. 3 years ago, it was very hard on me emotionally and I gained a lot of weight. My dad had a treatment where he was able to not loose weight or any hair which was really good because he continued on his life like nothing ever happened and he looked healthy. But about a month, the cancer spread liver, hip and spine and the doctors think the treatment will shrink the cancer but it crushed me in a million pieces. My sister got engaged and I'm just not looking forward to it because a little part of me is scared my dad won't make it.  I'm not as happy as I was before, I was the friend that cheered other people up but not anymore. Also one of my good friends was diagonsed with depression and has cut himself so I think that also made it harder for me as well. Plus there is this girl who I used to be friends with but I distanced myself because she has no filter and some of the things she says it's actually hurtful and she's kind of a bully but not intentionally. She also gets mad at the littest things, she was very mad that I didn't sleep over and made a whole big deal about it. It's hard to smile when at home and look at your life and it is not perfect 




 Dont give up, lol i hope 




 It really depends on the individual and when they think its right to loose it. If the oppournity comes if its a short-term boyfriend sure and a fling maybe. It all depends on the situation lol, i hope so! LOL we'll see  




 My best friend is gay and I hate it when people say ''ugh thats so gay''. Now there are people that use the word ''gay'' as a negative thing, where it is the opposite. There is nothing wrong with being gay, it's a whole other world that you should go into. You should not be ashamed of who you are. You are so brave to come out to your parents, I went to the pride parade to support my best friend, seeing him smile made me so happy its a community that he knows he for sure belongs in and he doesn't have to be scared of who he is. You shouldn't either, your parents will come around. You should join LGBT group to meet new friends. You are not a disappointment  




 My friend she lost it when she was 16 with her first boyfriend and she wished she waited because when she looks back she wished she lost it with her first real relationship and make it mean something. When your young you don't appericate it as much but it depends on the person. But when you play games or have discussions with friends, like who was your first time saying you lost it over a one night stand could make you regret it because it didn't mean anything to either person, but that first time will always be remebered as a one night stand  




 I'm 20 years old and I haven't lost virginity yet. 19 is a good age, many people have told me they regret loosing it at a younger age. I'm waiting for my first boyfriend, its a lot longer than I anticipated but I want my first to mean something than just a one night stand that means nothing. I don't think you will loose your boyfriend. 




 Not in order but here is my list
1. Veep
2. House of Cards
3. Scandal
4. Brookyln Nine Nine 




 By the grace of god listen to it  




 Make sure that she did not sleep with anyone else because there is a slim chance it could not be your baby. You should be supportive and ask what she wants. I think abortion would be the best route to go because its unplanned, you guys are both young, it was a one night stand but its all up to you two.  




 I think it's great that you were able to find an outlet, maybe explain to your parents in a way where she has to listen and say that you need this to help you. Do you like movies, TV shows, writting poems etc? Maybe there is another outlet you can use? My life is pretty hetic so I watch Movies, TV shows as an outlet to distract myself from the real world 




 Coming out is not easy. I don't know what it's like, but being able to come out of the closet and not know how people are going to react is very brave. You should be proud that you were able to do that, because unfortunately many are scared and hide their sexuality. Have you ever thought joining a LGBT group where you can meet new people and those that are experiencing what you are? You should not end your life, because if you do then your dad will win. You want to show your dad that you are better by living life to the fullest. You have so much to experience in so little time. Maybe go stay at a friends house? 




 Don't let it define who you are and make you think less about yourself. Go out there show it off and be yourself. Every one has someone for each other we just got to go ahead and find it.  




 Thank you, hearing someone else who have been through it helps me a lot. :) 




 Veep- Hilarious, foul mouth comedy- Julia from Seinfled is in it 
House Of Cards- Great dark drama- Kevin Spacey is in it 




 Easy A, Pitch Perfect, Walk To Remember
