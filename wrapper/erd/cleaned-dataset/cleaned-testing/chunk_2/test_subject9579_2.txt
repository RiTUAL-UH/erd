 Which is the best dungeon for finding Metal Mimics?

Cave of Desires Lvl 1 or 2? 




 Finally got him to drop after 10 tries. 

Good news is I didn't have any errors or significant problems clearing the dungeon. 

Bad news is, it took me 10 tries and I got a Guardian. *sigh*

Ran this team:

Lilly Matah (lead)

Darvanshel

Elimo

Lunaris

Mariudeth 

All were 6 star except Mariudeth who is maxed 5

I alternated between Maxwell, Grah, and Darvanshel friends.  




 I cannot access this sub's wiki (the one linked above)

I keep getting an error: 

you are not allowed to do that
 wiki_disabled.

Can anyone confirm if this is a site error or just a me error? 




 Great review!  I always love reading your analyses.

One small error I noticed though:
Garnan In-Depth Look, third bullet from the bottom, the second sentence should read non-Elza, I believe.

With so many similar sounding units I had to take a moment and research whether there was an Erza that I didn't know about  :)

 




 Ok, thanks for that.  Losing access to them in 5 days was definitely going to impact my strategy lol
