 We're going to WWHP in August. I would just like her to get a grasp of the basic story before, because she was too young to know when we went the first time. 




 Absolutely ABC. 




 Was Fred Rapier or Rodent? 




 I know! It was almost two years between GoF and OotP. 




 School always starts on September first, but it is sometimes a weekend date also. 




 The older two have already read them all. 




 I don't either, but Lucius never got the chance to rise to the state of power that Bartemius did. 




 I wanted to pass on my knowledge, my father's knowledge really; and make some humans, because the entire act is glorious. 




 Not Bellatrix? Not Rodolphus? Not Rabastan? Not Dolohov, Mulciber, Rookwood or Travers? 




 This is brilliant, great job.

The only problem I have is that Lucy didn't know that Snape was a good guy, but then Mister Malfoy was not necessarily a bad guy either.

 




 Regardless, I think Barty Jr. was guilty and just thought he could get away because of who his father was. I imagine Barty as the previous generation's Draco.

Barty didn't like it when his father heard about it. 




 Potions and sweat. 




 Tasty buds.

 Hoooold on.

 I just re-read it, chapter 30 GoF. 

As far as Sr. renouncing as his son, that didn't happen that way either did it? Or was Sr. simply complying to his wife's dying wishes?
 




 She's not having any trouble at all.

Love my little eaglet. 




 He was still caught with the other three.

I think it was a necessary punishment.
 




 I get that, but it wasn't until he mentioned it in front of Dobby in the staff room that his message got across. 




 Cheers!
 




 Well, you got the bit in the first book when they serve detention with Hagrid looking for whatever was killing the unicorns.

You got the bit in the second book when Hagrid told Harry and Ron to follow the spiders.

The bit in the third book when Hagrid walked his CoMC class deep into the forest to get to the hippogiriffs.

And I would also like to ad the scene in OotP when Hagrid introduced the trio to Grawp, and also when Hermione led Umbridge, Ron and Harry deep into the forest where Grawp was.

Edit: Ron didn't go with Harry, Hermione and Umbridge. 




 Not sure he was. Brings to mind the scene with the spider when he was showing the fourth years the unforgivables and he used the cruciatus curse in front of Neville, when he knew in fact that he had tortured Neville's parents to insanity using the same curse. Sure Neville didn't know his true identity at the time, but that was still a shitty thing to do. 




 Yaxley. He was an extremely powerful wizard with nothing but malice on his mind. 




 As you could probably read the book in an hour, I would start there. They are making this a trilogy all penned by Ms. Rowling herself, so it will go far and beyond the book I am almost sure. 




 Probably one of the first three. 




 They did say Voldemort in the cafe, but because of the fidelius charm on 12GP the DEs knew the general location, but they couldn't see the house. 




 There is a huge gap between canon and the films my slithery friend. 




 Chudley Cannons please. 




 LOL, all good man. 




 I love the entire arc of the book, but to me it drags on more than DH does sometimes. 

The main thing I dislike about it is fuckin' Umbridge. If any character in the history of fiction has ever made my skin crawl as much as Dolores Umbridge.

But she got hers in the end didn't she?

*clop clop* 




 Its not like the Death Eaters would be smart and keep them in separate evil lairs.

That made me laugh. 




 I agree completely my fellow lion. 




 I get the parenting thing, because I am one and I would do anything to get my daughter back, but I would not have resorted to telling my enemies/daughter's captor where the good guy was just to get her back.

I'm just saying that was a shitty thing to do. Why couldn't Xeno have just helped them, and let them leave in peace?

Edit: I'll answer my own question. That was after a bit of a lull in the story, so it brought some excitement.
 




 And he didn't even get Luna back after he said the taboo. The DEs just laughed at him.

*Treacherous little bleeder*
 




 Yea man, but stick to your convictions is what I say. 




 Xenophilius Lovegood. He was all about helping Harry until the DEs took Luna off the train. 




 If a person believes what they are saying, veritaserum can be tricked. It's the same reason a lie detector cannot be used in muggle court. 




 [The Greater Good](https://youtu.be/OGHBwk0quxs) is pretty awesome. 




 Correct, one is a curse, and the other is a charm. 




 If it were as simple as sending Voldemort an owl, don't you think the ministry would have thought of that? 




 If you read the text, chapter 13 of DH Hermione specifically uses the *Gemenio* charm to reproduce the locket. Chapther 26 of DH, Griphook plainly states that they have added the *Gemino* curse in the vault. Two different spells.

 I try to forget about Badenhop. 




 Don't know why you were downvoted, but this is correct. 




 did moody have the option of having a normal eye and chose to have the mad eye?

It's my headcanon that Moody made the eye himself, that would be the type of thing that would be dead useful for an auror, wouldn't you think? 




   And the security at Grimmauld place wasn't for Snape

No, Moody set up the tongue tying curse specifically for Snape, so he couldn't tell the other death eaters where it was. 




 Piertotem Locomortor

I've always wanted to use that spell. 




 What if d-o-g really spelled cat. 




 Definitely Helena Ravenclaw. 




 Yep, don't come here unless you want spoilers.
 




 That's what I thought. 




 I stand corrected. 




 Leave him be, the bible is as good a work of fiction as Harry Potter is. 




 He had seven after he attempted to kill Harry October 31, 1990, but it wasn't a real horcrux. 




 Correct, right before the start of year 4, so it might have been 93 even. 




 I don't know man, but if he is one of the best, they're sunk for the season. Chappy has already lost one this year, coaching perhaps? 




 Gemino curse was what caused the objects in the LeStranges' vault to multiplty. The Geminio charm is what Hermione used to replicate the locket after she took it from Umbridge, IIRC. 




 Only a knut to join SPEW. 




 It would have been a charm if anything and not a curse. I just think they sent that many. 




 He didn't make Nagini until 94 way after the basilisk was dead. Whether he knew that she was dead or not is another question. 









 What college do you go to? 




 I'm American, and I thought this was funny. Have my upvote OP. 




 Okay, I'm going to type slowly..

Kreacher belonged to the *Noble House of Black* and when Sirius told him to "Get out!" Kreacher took that as a command because Sirius was his master and he disappeared over the winter months, remember? Sirius was not very kind to Kreacher and the poor guy was locked up at 'Grim old place' with no one to talk to but Walburga's portrait. Padfoot even said he was crazy in the book.

When Harry inherited 12GP from Sirius he also inherited Kreacher, and that is why Kreacher was silenced when Harry told him to shut up in the chapter you spoke of, *Will and Won't?* One of my favorites. 




 Kreacher betrayed Sirius because he was abused and Sirius told him to, "Get out!"

Dobby on the other hand did what he thought was right, and punished himself accordingly. 




  it'd be quite beautiful if his last wand was the one he made for Luna.

I love this! 




 Ahhh, across the pond. I'll get there someday. 




 Gorgeous, where is that? 




 I think he would have been grateful, and would have probably made James, Albus, and Lily's wands for free.

If Harry had not come to Malfoy Manor, Garrick probably would have died there. 




 Been their many times. 




 Chum is FUM! 




 I like these, I watch these, but sometimes it's blatantly obvious that he did not read the books. 




 The Basilisk was a girl. The male are identifiable from the purple plume on their heads. 









 Da fuq?
 




 Correct. Hagrid made them walk deep into the forest, remember Ron and Harry thinking they were going to Aragog's lair? Hagrid probably just took down the corral and let them roam. 




 No, Harry is no where near as whiny as Luke. 




 Something like [this?](http://i.imgur.com/3woAuBW.jpg) 




 I don't know, it's hard to come up with an HP related pun for Parmelee.

Edit: Dumbledore's Parmy?
 




 Hippogriffs!

How sweet would it be to have a frickin' horse-eagle in your backyard anytime you wanted to go anywhere? 




 Dumbledore's Parmelee, FTFY. 









 How funny was Mel Brooks to work with on Mad About You? 




 Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition  




 Way to play it safe. ;o) 

I would expect nothing less from a classy lady such as yourself. 




 Hello Ms. Hunt. Who was your favorite actor to work with? 




 Sorry, it's a bad habit. 




 *Ob... viously..* 




 AHHH! My world has gone fubar for the day! How exciting would that have been? 




 One looks to the other and says "You know, I've never come this way before." The second replies, "Must be the cobblestones." 




 He shut the basilisk in the chamber and put it under a magical sleep until his own true heir returned to Hogwarts to awaken it, and that's what Riddle did. 




 How's Sunnyvale?
 









 That was the true veela at the QWC, and that is just the way they are. They weren't as nice looking when the leprechauns broke up their  chance at distracting the referee, were they?

Was it Mostafa? 




 Now that you mention it, I think I only know one or two people with real black hair. 




 Not sure what basis you're going on here, but they're described as beautiful creatures that have an ability to attract men. 

If you're on about the film, then that's just the way they chose to cast it. 




 Knew that Harry had Snape's old book? 




 I think Ron did in the film, but I'm almost sure Slughorn did when Harry approached him the first time about the horcrux after Albus gave him the task, it could have been another time. Maybe Hagrid's hut?

Edit: I mean the book in the second examples.
 




 that Slughorn called Harry the potions "Prince?" 




 I like to think that they shared little hints and such, and that was why Lily was so good? 




 Absolutely. Albus says something to the effect of Horace likes collecting famous and powerful people, and that he would try to collect Harry.

Dumbledore thought that because Lily was Horace's favorite student, and that Harry was her son, that Harry would be able to extract the memory to further the plot. 




 Thanks, I just know what I read in the books.
 




 I believe it was GoF after the graveyard that Dumbledore says that Harry Potter and Tom Riddle had gone farther to unite themselves than any two wizards in history that he knew of, so (paraphrasing) it was inevitable that there would be no way to completely keep them apart.

Albus was over 100 by then, a brilliant man such as himself would surely know wizarding history by now. 




 Regardless, Cornelius was literally ignoring the facts from someone that he would take advice from in the past, (Albus Dumbledore), nothing could have been said to assuage him. 




 Fudge would not have believed it anyway, and memories can be tampered with. 




 Still love your flair Boog. 




 There is a great book that starts out, "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four Privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much."

I'd start there.

Edit: I would avoid all of the films until you have read each book. 




 I was never a fan of the Lemon strains. Lemon Kush, Lemon Haze... they taste great but the high never lasts as long, and it's mostly in your head. 




 Not really as Kingsley was high up in the auror office at the time, I bet he could probably do whatever and wizards wouldn't give it a second thought.
 




   I assume Dumbeldore hooked him up somehow

I've asked this question before, and some have suggested that Kingsley nicked it from the ministry for him. 




 To add to your post OP, one of my biggest pet peeves is people that actually think that death created the hallows when in fact it was just three powerful wizards. 




 Right, the leaf doesn't reflect UV like the bud does. 




 I like that one. 




 I think it's just UV light. 




 I would call it albino.
 




 Not sure I'd risk naming my kid after my brother. What if he turned out to be an asshole? I would rather go with some folk that have already established themselves.
