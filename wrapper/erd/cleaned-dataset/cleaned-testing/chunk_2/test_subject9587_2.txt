 When we play the Seahawks in week 3, we will be underdogs (and rightfully so - predict 4.5 points or so).  That being said, the Broncos have the talent and tools to compete and win that game.  Seattle looked strong, but they did not look immortal by any means.   




 They have outtakes, but they call them, "Mulligans". 




 I want to die.

Source:  playing against a buddy who has Harvin, Lynch, and Hauscha. 




 K, FanBro.

Most people sort by new to follow the game.  People don't up vote very long because they are trying to keep up.  Cool your tits.  Fuck the Raiders. 




 I would say 80% hate him, 10% tolerate him, and 10% apologize for him. 




 Well when he tosses their salad and tastes his salty discharge, he'll know. 




 New Glarus?  Ale Asylum? 




 Fair statement.  




 Don't worry, we'll get em week3. 




 I am also playing against Beast Mode right now.  I am 40 points in the hole because my buddy has 3 seahawks.  




 I have redemption rye.

Cannonball comin! 




 All year.  It's what they do.  Remember how long Flacco/Moore was mentioned off hand Last year? 




 Feels bad, right?

Hug it in bros, I live in Madison now.  Feel many of your pains. 




 Is it 1991? 




 Yeah, that was a big win for the Pack. 




 Wow, you're a great human being. 




 That was poor. 




 He does.  He is a mixture of Al Gore ' s boring Ness and Hitler ' s meanness. 




 Yeah, I think so. 
Seems fine.  I'd watch, "Denzel Washington takes names all day". 




 I know right?   NBC cherry picking plays to meet their narrative of, "Wilson is maturing as a passer by getting rid of it quickly" 




 Collinsworth is flabbergasted that an NFL player can run all the way down the field . . . 




 Oh man, I don't know.  I have never seen them out of the Midwest.  




 I love football. 




 We have a superior version called cheese curds.  




 GE, getting weird and awesome on us. 




 I know right?  Leave willy wonka alone. 




 We've always been at war with Eastasia 




 Yeah, that is pretty great. 




 Richard?  Ya dead? 




 Oops, I'm racist. 




 Coooooooooooooooooooooon! 




 Awkward.  Blocked right into it. 




 Yes; for statistical purposes, a gain of 0 for the QB is a sack, and the closest defender gets credit if he runs out of bounds. 




 5 yard penalty; was only 4th and 2. 




 Back to back errors by the Pack. 




 Chipped my tooth on my fork tonight. 

DM; HF. 




 Bad news:  Three of the most improved teams are in the Central. 

Good news:  At least the Avs are one of them.

Starting to get really stoked for hockey! 




 Me too, actually.  I love to hate the Raiders more than the Chiefs and Chargers.  I want our rivals back! 




 Of course you're right.  As a fanbase, the Seattle loss hit us pretty hard.  Many newer fans weren't invested during the 80's blowouts, so Superbowls were fun and games to them.  Seattle taught many of them how horrible "The Big Game" can really be.  Hence, our hatred for Seattle is very fresh in our mind, and I want to destroy them.

That being said - if, by some miracle, Super Bowl 49 features a dominant Seahawks team vs. Derek Carr and the scrappy, surprise Raiders, I will be rooting for the Seahawks to destroy you filthy Raiders *44*-8, leading them to be declared the a new Dynasty, the greatest defense ever, and listening to their fans harp on about how "only the NFC West plays real football" for the next decade.

Any Broncos fan who feels otherwise has simply lost perspective. 




 I think one side is logos, and the other side is colors, right?  Logos are all the same, but half are orange and half are blue? 




 I think it is very reasonable to pick up Bubba (I am yelling in my wife's ear to grab him for her last bench slot right now).  Remember last year when Welker was out with his concussion and Bubba was the best player in the Thursday night loss vs. San Diego?

No reason that kind of thing can't happen again.  

You'd need a pretty deep league (12+ players, and at least 1 flex, maybe two) to give him a serious start those first four weeks, but in later rounds it is hard to see that much upside. 




 Your Montee team should be called, "The Montee Ball Problem".

 




 I came here to say this.  I always thought of Mostromart when seeing the Publix slogan. 




 The herpesvirus family has three groups:  alpha, beta, and gamma.  They are largely classified by the site where they establish a latent infection. 

Alphaherpesviruses are HSV1, HSV2,  and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV, which causes chickenpox upon initial infection, and shingles upon reactivation later in life).  Site of latency:  neurons.

Betaherpesviruses are things like Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and a few lesser known ones like HHV-6.  They are latent in certain progenitor blood cells.

Gammaherpesviruses are Epstein-Barr Virus, KSHV, and a few others.  They are latent in some immune blood cells.

So: tl; dr --  Related by genetics and similar life cycles, but specific sites of latency and disease states are different. 




 I think you've got it exactly right - the potential for a latent infection poses a real challenge for vaccination.  In addition, these viruses seem to be very good at modulating the immune system just enough to stay under the radar.

That being said, that a vaccination exists for Chicken Pox is encouraging. 




 Also, it was just in /r/ science:

http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/28vuzr/science_ama_series_iama_virologist_who_studies/ 




 Officially it was a Ph.D. In Biomedical Sciences -- Immunology   Microbiology.

Now I am studying a different herpes virus,  CMV, as a Post-doc.  This virus is also mentioned in the article that is posted, so I am planning on giving it a close read tomorrow. 




 Hey there!  I studied hsv-1 for my PhD thesis and did an AMA on /r/askscience.  Lots of great questions asked that day - many about distinguishing hsv 1 and 2. 




 I don't think that's right . . . 




 I am going with "The Montee Ball Problem". 




 This.  My worst fantasy season came with Stafford as my QB.

He'd throw three picks and flirt with a negative point total one week, and then go for 30+ the next week (after I benched him, obviously).

Do not go down the Matt Stafford road.  It is folly. 




 The Montee Ball Problem 




 Juwanaman!!! 




 *sigh* I'd watch it. 




 Man, his cheeks are going to be so warm in December . . .

Comment 6 or so 




 We're you around for the Taylor Swift parody fight between me and a Pats fan in the Championship Trask talk thread?  Seems like it might be up your alley. 




 These are definitely the Raiders.  




 Gotta say, Raiders are looking better than I thought. 

Seattle might actually kill Rodgers on opening night if this o line doesn't improve. 




 Whoo preseason!  I would watch another game too, but the Packers are on local TV so I don't have to hook up a computer. 




 Oh my god, YES! 

Can Phil Simms say more blatantly incorrect things? 




 [NO SPRINGS!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO-_LJZbG7E)
 




 Eh, forget my lawyer. 




 Hitler, North Dakota?
 




 I don't think so . . . 




 You mean at the end?  I think Homer told her over the phone that they were going to try one more place, and she decided to show up, too. 




 Yeah, Homer kind of white-washed how sexy that stag party was going to be, but that really isn't that big of a problem - he didn't lie to her about anything.

And, her criticism that he is teaching Bart that it is okay to objectify women is really unfair.  He is just dancing with a stripper - who isn't even partially naked!   




 Keep in mind that sometimes the Broncos can go 5 wide.  

Last year it was usually DT, Decker, Orange, Welker, and Caldwell.  Caldwell caught one of the opening day 7 TDs this way.

A similar 5-wide this year could include any from this group of 6:  DT, Orange, Sanders, Welker, Caldwell, Latimer.

So, he will get some snaps, even without injuries.  There's also the distinct possibility of him spelling DT after one of those long screen plays or some other deep-ball.

Of course, if a WR gets nicked up a bit, it will be much easier for him to get in there. 




 I would like to challenge your interpretation of the ending.

The final scene is Donald Duck, awakening from a nightmare wearing USA-themed pajamas with a *Home, Sweet Home* decoration behind his bed, and a shadow on his wall, seemingly cast by a Nazi heiling (possibly even Hitler).

It is then revealed that the shadow is cast by a novelty Statue of Liberty, upon which Donald hugs and kisses it and says, "Oh boy, am I glad to be a citizen of the United States of America "

So, three things here:  

First, the immense over-the-top patriotism noted both by the pajamas and the statement could easily be interpreted as approaching caricature - suggesting that such high praise for the USA is questionable, at best.

Second, there is the rather obvious observation that the Statue of Liberty casts a shadow image which is indicative of oppression and fascism.  This can be interpreted as a suggestion that even a system supposedly based on liberty could in fact be something else.  I believe if you check some of the leading intellectuals at the time, the idea that "freedom" was just another kind of control, and "tyranny" just another form of freedom was often discussed.

Finally, I consider it important that Donald's statement was in the form of a question.  If you are going for a happy, exclamatory statement about how great the USA is, it removes nothing to have Donald actually state it.  The fact that he asks the question, "Am I glad. . . ?" is telling.

Surface level, sure, it is very, very anti-Nazi.  But isn't there something going on underneath?  I think it is ultimately a cartoon pondering the danger of becoming the evil that you purport to be fighting against, in this case, due to overuse of propaganda, stereotypes, and stolen symbols.

 




 Oh, gotcha.  I was thinking "plot" all the way. 




 Yeah, that's the cat.
 




 This is indeed a disturbing universe. 




 My team's wins don't count, yet.

*YET.* 




 I would've gone with "Poltergeist". 




 Respect.

I mean, hatred too, obviously.

But still respect.

PS:  We're catching you in wins this year! 




 I think he means the weird-looking bespectacled dude with the long straight hair who always gets mustard or soda spilled all over his nice suit, often by J.P. (JG-L's buddy). 




 Happily upvoted a Raiders fan because he is 100% dead-on correct. 




 Be reasonable.  He can't be that awful. 




 Omar had really good coverage on that 3rd down there.  Defense is looking okay so far. 




 See, I like Carroll the least of them.  Sherman is loud and obnoxious, but backs it up so you tip your cap.  Wilson is scrappy and a leader who earned his spot and the Seahawks are riding the boon of paying him pittance for now (ditto *many* others).

Carroll just some failure Jets coach who cheated his way through a college system which rewards renown and flew the coop back to the pros when the writing was on the wall.

Fuck Pete Carroll.  




 Strangely, this is often my thought. 




 I mean, I will still contend that if those teams play 10 games, neither wins 7.  Seahawks won the one they played,  so who cares.

Week three will be horrible and awesome. 




 I mean, sometimes your shit gets tossed.  Happens to all of us.  All you can do is put on the orange, wear it proud, and go after the next trophy even harder. 

 




 Oh!  You mean like a pussy! 




 New strategy discussion: 

Isn't being up 6 better than up 5 or 4?

I mean 5 and 4 are basically no different,  but six means 2 FG ties and even a touchdown forced a make from 33 yards.  Seems like Broncos should go for 2 there. 




 People hate Seattle because they are the new kids on the block and act like they are the fucking 49ers.

Fans and players and coach alike.

I mean, it's fine if you want to act that way, but shit comes around in this league.  




 In "Fuck the Raiders" news:

Seattle ' s third string QB started for you last year.  And he looks bad against other third stringers.

And in related, "Fuck the Steelers" news:  you made him look good. 




 Thompson #40 jersey purchsed.

#notreallybutseriouslyamiright? 




 Yeah, seems dumb, but NFL wants to try it out. 




 Allegedly. 




 Check new rules.

For first 2 preseason games, all PAT will be snapped from 15.  Trial period for possible rule change this offseason. 




 Oh don't get me wrong; I am pissing and moaning at the tv, too, and getting way too riled up insinuating various phallus - pleasing transactions involving referees.

Thing is - we should relax. 




 Most starters should be out now (except for the de facto starters like Kayvon), and I was very pleased with both first team O and D.  I don't think anyone can say that the Broncos didn't show up and go toe to toe with, and likely best, the Superbowl champs.

Way pleased. 




 So here's the deal:  The refs are in their first preseason game too.  It is very fresh in their minds what they need to emphasize and call.  Much of it has been horribly tricky tack and pretty bullshit.   They should tone it down when the games matter, because it just looks stupid when they watch the film and a LB gets called for illegal contact on a 1 second play when the defender MISSES his man. 




 The wife and I just moved to Madison (first week anniversary, woo!).  Any resident Broncos fans or local hangouts?  Probably wont get too excited for the preseason, but I think once the games mean something we would love to meet up! 




 First, it is important to recognize that only certain kinds of viruses can do this.  Let's divide all human viruses into three broad categories:  DNA, RNA, and Retro- viruses.

RNA viruses only ever use RNA as their genetic material.  They will not leave DNA in our genome at all.  Flu, Cold, and the newly popular Chikungunya are a few examples. 

DNA viruses act pretty much like extra, tiny chromosomes, transcribing and replicating in a very similar fashion.  Some of these may have mechanisms for inserting their DNA into the host, but some of that research is still controversial.  Your DNA viruses are things like the herpesviruses,  HPV, Adenovirus and Poxviruses.

The Kings of integration, though, are Retroviruses (HIV being the most well known).  These viruses use RNA as their genetic material, but reverse - transcribe to DNA as an intermediate!  One part of the process involves an enzyme called integrase - it's job is to put the DNA intermediate into the host genome for subsequent activation (leaving it dormant).  Trouble is, sometimes the integration site isn't specific, and you can imagine how inserting Kilobases into a random gene could cause problems.   




 I would agree with you.  Having that line would be akin to Harrison Ford's stupid voice-over chiming in right after the "Like tears in rain" line in *Blade Runner*.

 




 Okay, I'll be there next week. 




 Struggled to come up with Brandon Lloyd, then it clicked with 1:30 left to go!

It was also fortunate that only two receivers who accomplished this feat *before* I was born:  Watson and Taylor.

One is prominently featured in numerous Elway documentaries, and the other is on the ring of fame.

Also, I spelled "Lelie" wrong about four times before I got him. 




 Good point;  we're on Verizon. 




 Will I have a pretty good view from behind my desk? 




 Awesome.  That will be an early visit, as the wife has never had cheese curds.  In fact, I had to explain what they were last week! 




 Standard deal; I understand. 




 Hey folk!

I am moving to Madison in about a week with my wife for a new job, and we are getting all of our Ps and Qs in order for the move (it is non-trivial; we are coming from Florida).

Some of the FAQs which interest me most are a bit outdated due to the nature of the questions, so I thought I would throw out another set of questions.

First, we are probably bailing on Bank of America.  They are fine, but it appears that the closest BoA in in Illinois - and while most of the stuff we would need is very do-able via the internet, it is probably best to be able to visit the bank in person just in case.  So, what kinds of banking / credit unions have impressed you?  We are looking at Chase, US Bank, and a couple credit unions.

Of equal importance - ISPs.  The FAQ in the sidebar is from three years ago, so I wanted a bit of an update.  What is the landscape of ISPs in Madison?  We are in western Madison, out by the Beltline Hwy, if that matters at all.  I know I can google up answers to these things, but I want any personal accounts of how things function for you folk.

Thanks a bunch!


Edit:  One day later and I've gotten a bunch of thought-out, awesome responses.  We've started researching some of the specifics, and you fine folk are definitely making the transition easier.  Many thanks! 




 It is still the same virus, the condition it causes is just called something else (because it has different effects).
