 How Reaper would have ended

 Ratings were marginal, although it was up against American Idol, which was a ratings juggernaut back then.

I really thought it was a good show. Ray Wise was great fun as the devil.  




 Champion! 




 You can watch the trailer for "DOOMED! The Untold Story of Roger Corman's THE FANTASTIC FOUR" and see what you think.

 The movie was made seriously on the cheap and a lot of the people who worked on the film took very little money to work on it in the hopes that the exposure of being in a major, superhero film would pay off for them.

Ooops. 




 That was...not good.

The parking garage fight was just a lot of guys randomly flailing at each other and once they get into the elevator, they just wave huge knives around in the air until everyone falls down. 




 I'm actually a big fan of smart, mixed-used development. But, as I noted above, there were a lot of unaddressed issues with The Lighthouse project, especially with respect to transit and infrastructure. Wang though he could just ignore them and push the project through by setting deadlines that he insisted the local authorities had to meet.

Not to mention the fact that the development rights to the area around the Coliseum were and are tremendously valuable. Why should Nassau give them away for free just because Wang happens to own a hockey team? 

And, since this is Nassau County, the bribe envelopes were probably just way too light. 




 Hey, you're young and swingin'

No time to think about tomorrow

But there ain't no way to deny it

Some day, you're gonna buy it.

Plan today,

Go with Ferryman tomorrow!

Ferryman, Ferryman,

he's the man with the plot, the man with the plan!

Ferryman, Ferryman,

He's the mortician man who loves you!

A lot!

 Wang wanted to build a huge, mixed use development around the area of the Coliseum, the Lighthouse Project. Problem was, there are a lot of issues with dropping a huge development like that into the heart of one of the most densely-packed counties int he nation. And, from what I remember, all of the serious issues, from traffic to parking to water and sewer, were essentially dismissed with head pats hand waves.

When that fell though, Wang turned around and asked Nassau to foot the bill for a 400 million building, which the people of Nassau wisely rejected.

It's sad that the Islanders are leaving, but these kind of huge development boondoggles can haunt local governments for decades if they go all pear shaped. Ask the Brooklynites how the Atlantic Yards thing is working out for them. 









 I still consider Dragonslayer one of the best Fantasy movies of all time. It engages seriously with a lot of the classic fantasy elements and slyly comments on them as well.

And, then there's this 

No, of course not. They never do tests. Not many real deeds either. Oh, conversation with your grandmother's shade in a darkened room, the odd love potion or two, but comes a doubter, why, then it's the wrong day, the planets are not in line, the entrails are not favorable, "we don't do tests"! 




 Bah, this could be such a cool show and they morph it into another CBS procedural.

Limitless would be cool as a Fugitive (or Incredible Hulk, if you prefer) "man on the run" show. You could still have the procedural element as the main character solves crimes and helps the downtrodden as he's tries to avoid being caught by the shadowy government agency that wants him dead and looks for the secret to NZT before he runs out.

Actually, sounds a lot like The Hulk. Man, I loved that show. 




 I'd say that L.A. Story is my favorite Steve Martin movie, but this one is certainly one of my favorites. It's such a rare thing for a romantic comedy to have both good romance and good comedy.

Martin is just so good as a romantic, leading man in this film, it's a little sad that he didn't do it more often in his career. And Daryl Hannah, while not bringing a lot to the table acting-wise, is at her peak hotness.

Plus I love that the nose is just so over-the-top, cartoonish and ridiculous, but everyone just plays it straight. 




 I asked my wife to marry me in a similar fashion. 

No cake, though. Ring rolled in a note tucked inside a piece of 1930's-era art pottery. 




 Here's what it means.

We're not going to pay you any actual money because we don't have any. Even though one of the biggest reasons for startups to fail is under capitalization, and not being able to pay employees is a huge, red flag, not to mention illegal,  we'd like you to risk everything on this supremely bad bet. 

 But, in the unlikely event that the company takes off and your equity is actually worth something, rest assured we'll find a way to screw you out of that too. 




 Not me. 

I don't mind a few ads, but because their ad inventory is so limited you see the same fucking ad over and over and over again.

I binge watched The Good Wife on Hulu+ and the only way I stayed sane was by pulling the earbud out of my ear whenever the ads started to roll. 




 In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. 




 Did you actually sign a non-compete agreement?

It's pretty unheard of for non-competes to be enforced against low-paid, hourly workers. Generally, you need to be fairly high up in the food chain and the business has to have legitimate business interests to protect, clients, trade secrets, etc. They can't enforce a non-compete just because they don't want you to work somewhere else.

What state do you live in? Non-compete laws vary widely by state and some states don't allow them at all. 




 Maybe he was dictating. 




 Generally, mandatory tip out/tip pools are limited to employees who regularly receive tips. A valid tip pool may not include employees who do not customarily and regularly received tips, such as dishwashers, cooks, chefs, and janitors.

 You don't have to type up an official letter. You're an intern.

Once you have a solid job offer from campus IT (very important), just meet with your boss as soon as possible and let him know when your last day is going to be. 

For something like this, it's always good to thank him for the opportunity and tell him how much you've enjoyed working there. Then ask if there's anything he wants you to finish up or document before you leave.

Then shake his hand and say thanks again. 




 Have you tried replacing the .htaccess file with a a blank one and then setting the permalink settings again?

I could probably help you with this, but you're probably better asking on /r/WordPress 




 Yeah, over 20 days you should get 2880 elves max from spawning and a potential 240 from tapping the elf cave, although in practice it would be pretty hard to do that unless you log in every eight hours on the dot.

That's 2920 elves. According to my calculations, the cogwheels to elf ratio is roughly 1.2. Tapped elves drop four cogwheels roughly 30% of the time. So your theoretical cogwheel max is 3504 from elves. Plus another 200 from your daily bonus once a week. That's 3704, which gets you to a level 16 cannon. 

You're still over 3000 short from level 20. 




 I'd like to see some DC animated stuff on the CW in prime time. I'm a little surprised that this hasn't happened already. 




 I'd say Arrow took about a half a season to really hit its stride. Things started to come together with the Huntress arc and really took off once Slade Wilson and Felicity Smoak became regulars.  




 Bottom line? The show is just a lot more fun than Arrow.

Don't get me wrong. I like Arrow and I think it's a fine and entertaining show, but we've seen a lot of that stuff before in other places. A lot of the tone is similar to what we got in the Nolan Batman movies. 

Flash is a more accessible character. The show has kept the brooding and self-loathing to a minimum and played up the lighter, more entertaining aspects of the story. Barry has a cool power and he enjoys it.

Plus, the CW really caught lightning in a bottle with Grant Gustin. He's got a ton of charisma . 




 You also might want to consider the possibility that you're being hazed. Blue collar jobs often involve some hazing of newbies. I could see that expecting you to remember the whole schedule could be a joke they're playing on you. 




 What kind of idiot runs a company based like this based on employee memory? You're talking about over a hundred different bits of data every week. I have a very good memory and there's no way I could handle that. 

What is it that your "too slow" about? If it takes you a couple minutes to look up data on a spreadsheet the world grinds to a halt? That's just very odd. 




 Some interesting responses so far. 

I've always been the guy, when random new things come up, I figure out how to make them work. That's kind of how I started doing web pages. I wrote my first CGI program in compiled DOS basic so it would run on an EMWACS web server. 

I'm also the guy who often figures out what the solution to a problem is, even if I don't personally have the skill set to implement it. I can usually find the right tool or the odd bit of software or the best person to do a job. Plus I have a knack for listening to people's problem and finding out what the real issue is and how to solve it in principle at least before we even get to the technology part of it.

I have one old client who calls me up when he has these kinds of seemingly intractable problems. But how would you market and monetize that to other people? 

Hey, I'm a lot smarter than anyone you have working for you. If you have something nobody you work with can figure out, I probably can.

Sounds pretty dubious and not a little bit douchey. 




 I believe that it is, in fact, mathematically impossible to get to level 20 cannon without dumping atomic shitloads of donuts into buying cogs.

If I did the math correctly, the total number of possible elves over the course of the event is 2880. That's six elves an hour times 24 hours times 20 days for the event. 

To get to level 20 you need over 6000+ cogwheels. 
 




 Dude, are you telling me that your bosses don't know the phone number for human resources? I find that hard to believe.

That's who you need to call. Tell them you're being paid the tipped minimum wage even though you receive no tips, in clear violation of the FLSA. Even if you were a tipped employee, you would have to be reporting your tips and Applebee's would have to make up the difference if your tips didn't push your earnings up to the minimum wage.

The odds that these people are just shining you on, telling you how hard they're working to correct your pay while not doing anything are pretty good.  

Good luck. 




 I've been doing part-time, freelance IT work for about two decades. I've done all manner of different and varied IT tasks for small and medium sized business. 

These days I mostly do WordPress websites, but I have one client, my oldest client, who calls me up when they have random issues that they have no answer for. For example they had a client whose website was built in some crappy, custom , undocumented PHP CMS and I was able to transfer it over to a new server and keep it running for a couple years while the new website was being built.

So, it occurred to me this week that this might be a way I could market myself. I'm a decent enough coder and I have a raft of general IT skills, but my true talent lies in being able to poke at a problem until I find the soft part where the solution lives.

I do a lot of this kind of random problem solving in my day job doing scientific research support.

So, the questions are are these. One, is there a real need for this sort of thing? And two, is there a way to market this without sounding like a self-important douche bag?  




 Except that this is not true at all. 

The US Attorney's office released some "get tough" press release where they said Aaron was potentially facing thirty or fifty years in prison or whatever. They took all the crimes he was charged with, added up the max sentences and voila, he's spending the rest of his life in prison. You see this kind of thing all the time. Blah blah person is facing SIX HUNDRED YEARS in prison or some nonsense.

Except that Federal sentencing doesn't work that. There are guidelines based on intent, damage caused, the number of offenses, etc. Given the circumstances it was very unlikely that Aaron would have gotten more than a year and even possible that he would have gotten off with probation.

It's a little confusing for some people because the CFAA, like a lot of federal crimes has a hefty max penalty, 20 years in this case, but no minimum. 




 Why was it wrong? What was wrong about it?

Swartz broke the law. He broke it knowingly and caused a lot of issues for people on the MIT campus.  It's certainly not unreasonable for a US Attorney to want him to spend a few months as a guest of the Federal Government because of that.

It was sad that he killed himself, but that's nobody's fault but his own. We don't even know that killed himself because of the prosecution. He didn't leave a note or other indication.  




 What's the point of that? If donuts don't give you much of an advantage, people won't buy them. 




 I'm thinking I might quit the game for a couple weeks. The whole tap the elves thing is boring as hell and there's no way I'm getting the island at this point. 




 I know, right. Every time I hang out Mike Colter he's all like, "The  Wire is the best show ever on television" 

And I have to go, "Dude, you know I love you, but season 5 still stinks" 




 The other reason to ask for a higher number is to discourage this from happening in the future, at least discourage it from happening routinely.

I assume that, since you quit, you don't want to work there anymore. If they feel they can call you back at your old salary, what's to stop them from doing it all the time?

If they really really need you to come back and train their new hire as a one time thing, double your original rate is very cheap. If they don't really need you to train this new person or if they actually want to see if they can get you to come back in and do more work from time to time, then double your rate is too expensive and they won't pay it. By this method, you determine their true intent.  




 The correct answer is at least double your regular hourly rate. 

Look, you're doing them a big favor here by coming back and training their new hire after giving them more than ample time to find a replacement. The least they can do is pay you for your time and inconvenience.

And tell them you want payment in advance. 




 The only thing I would say here is not to make a decision out of fear. You've got a year to go before your job might go away. Don't take a demotion and less money because of that.

A year is a long time. Anything can happen between now and then.

Believe in your own value. If it were me, I'd call the recruiter and tell him that you're not interested in a Tier 2 job. You've got the requisite experience and have been working in the Tier 3 role for some time and you can't see any good reason to take a step down in salary and responsibility.

Of course, that's easy for me to say. It's not my job on the line. But with a year to go, a good skill set and the economy on the upswing, I like your chances. 

Good luck.  




 You're being seriously underpaid. How are you getting your work? Is there some middleman or agency that's finding work for you?

What subjects are you writing about? 




 Why would you consider taking this offer? What's the point of going down in title and responsibility for a $5K bump? 

Do they offer something else that you want? Is there more opportunity at the new place? And why would you even think that you're a "self-entitled jerk" because you're unhappy that they pulled a bait and switch on you?  




 The underlying idea  is very cool. 

Scientists devise a way to record experiences and play them back. Not unlike Strange Days (1995). Some guy dies while wearing the recording headset and then the race is on to get that tape.

It's worth watching, if you've never seen it. I believe ut was Natalie Wood's last movie. 




 Brainstorm (1983)

 Approach it like it's just something they overlooked. 

"Hey Boss, I'm sorry to bring this up, but I checked the provincial overtime regulations and blah blah blah. I just wanted to bring this to your attention because we could be in trouble because it seems like we're not following them."

For a small business with few employees, they may not know all the relevant regulations. Even if it's an intentional oversight, playing it like it's an innocent mistake lets them correct the error and save face. 




 I don't think you have to mention the other job at all. You work there five days a month. What you do the rest of the time is none of their business.

Just tell the Job A boss that you've decided that driving an hour and a half to work four hours just doesn't make sense for you anymore but that you'd be willing to telecommute. Then stop talking and see what he says.

Be prepared with particulars, how they'd verify that you're working, how the work would get done, etc, but wait until asked.

Then just be polite and firm about it.

 Except that if you had a magic space drive that could give you constant, limitless 9.8m/s^2 acceleration, you'd reach near light speed in less than a year and make the 4.24 ly trip in something like five years.  




 You've made an error. The universe is not Newtonian. It is not possible to travel faster than the speed of light.

After about 354 days at 1g acceleration you've reached nearly the speed of light and traveled about half a light year. After that, you travel at close to light speed until you turn around and decelerate. 

So you spend a year traveling .5 light years. Coast at .9 C for about four years and then turn around and decelerate for a year.

That's about five years or so for a magical 1g drive to get to Proxima. 




 Any company that fires people when they give notice doesn't get notice. That's all part of the karma wheel.

Also, all commissions earned must be paid. You can take them to court if they don't.

Congratulations and good luck in your new adventure. 




 It always is. 




 You need to be compensated for any time spent on work tasks assigned to you by your employer. If they ask you to come in for a meeting on your off day, they must pay you for that. If they ask you to complete a self-evaluation form, they must pay you for that. If they expect you to study materials they provide to you so you can pass a test they give you, they must pay you for that.

In my job, I have a lot material to read, understand and pass tests on to remain qualified. All of the time I spend doing that is paid.

Frankly, a lot of this stuff sounds cuckoo bananas to me. I'd be looking for the exit door ASAP. 




 I don't know whether you can do the work or not, but I can tell you that everyone feels like this at one time or another. Google "Imposter Syndrome" and read up on it. It's very common.

Nobody knows everything. Everybody has to look shit up. 

Put your head down, work hard, use your brain and if you feel unsure of yourself, just fake it 'til you make it.

Good luck!  




 I loved this movie. My friends and I used quote it to each other all the time. 

"We only have sex twelve times a year"

"Once a month is not too bad"

"No, nothing all year and then twelve times in one night"

I think this ones is the list of movies that could never, ever be made today.  




 First a plum, then a banana...I think I know what he is trying to say, eh.  




 That woman was trying to sell you the Kirby Home Maintenance System. I was a Kirby salesman for a couple of months in 1986. 

Nice to see that the basic pitch hasn't changed in nearly 30 years. 




 Just tell him that vacation days are part of your compensation, just like your salary, health insurance, etc. They're not freebies that the company throws in because they like you.

If there's too much work for you to take time off, that's certainly a problem, but it's not your problem to solve. It's not right for your boss to ask you to forgo time off because there's too much work  any more than it would be right to ask you to skip a paycheck because the company had cash flow issues.

You shouldn't be thinking about snappy comebacks. You need to sit down with your boss at the beginning of the year and tell him that the company gives you X number of days a year for paid time off and you intend to use them, so when would be the best time of the year to schedule them. 




 It seems pretty dead at the moment. There was no I-Con in 2014 and probably no con in 2015.

It's very sad. My first I-Con was VII, I believe. I worked on the con for many years. And now it's gone. 




 You can look on fiverr.com and see if there are small jobs you can do for a few dollars here and there.  




 I don't know about that. I bought a cheapo Acer Chromebook and the battery life is pretty ridiculous. I can usually get eight solid hours of work out of it. 

MacBook Pro probably sucks a lot more juice, even though it has a bigger battery. 




 First, because race, as we commonly talk about it, is a social construct. There is no scientific, biological basis for the concept of race and no credible researcher in the field of human genetics talks about race.

Second, intelligence is a pretty mushy concept. How do we determine one person is more or less intelligent than another? The only tools we have are tests, all of which come with their own racial and cultural biases and very few of which have any success teasing out innate intelligence (whatever that means) from education and culture.

Third, the question has very little value, especially compared to the damage this topic has caused. 

So, anyone who really wants to talk about race and intelligence in a serious way is almost certainly ignorant, a crank or a stone racist.  




 A lot of times, breed rescue organizations will go through local shelters and take all the adoptable dogs in their specific breed. Sometimes they'll even take breed mixes. So what ends up happening is the only dogs you find are pits and pit mixes. 




 I was telling a guy at work about Blazing Saddles. He's from China and has never seen it. 

I had to speak about it somewhat indirectly because you can't say half the things in the movie at work without risking your job. 




 Not my work. My video editing skills are rudimentary at best and my artistic talent sadly sub par. 

I just found it on the interwebs and wanted to share it because I thought it was cool and I love the movie. Glad you enjoyed it. 




 This film pre-dates the PS2 by 16 years or so. 

I don't think I was that impressed with the effects when this came out. It was very different than what I was used to. 

I don't think anyone had seen anything like this before, so there was a lot of slack given. This was the first movie to use CGI visual effects for almost all of the space battle scenes.  




 I loved this movie when it came out. Saw it in the theater with my geek bros the summer after I graduated high school.

It's a little shocking that nobody has seriously talked about re-making this. It has all the YA elements those kids today seem to like. Maybe a lot of people just don't remember it or never heard of it. Maybe the rights are all tied up? Who knows.

And, of course,  who could replace the great Robert Preston? 









 No mayor is that stupid? Rob Ford? Marion Barry? And those were just two that were in the national news. 




 The value is pretty low, though. I'd guess that for this game you'd be able to pick up tix on StubHub or TicketExchange for pretty cheap.

Still, if I were a young kid and a big fan I could see doing something like this. Spend a day shoveling out the stadium with your fellow fans and then watch the game knowing that it was partially your sweat that made it possible.  




 There are no credible arguments against man-made global warming. While there's quite a bit of debate about the range of temperature change, the severity of the issue and so forth, the facts that the global climate is warming and human beings are at least somewhat responsible for it are not in dispute by any reputable scientist who actually studies the issue.

It's important also to understand that "scientist" is a pretty broad category and scientific research is broken up into fairly specialized fields. Someone who is a chemist, for example, has no more standing to talk about the scientific research with respect to climate change than any other well-educated lay person. The fact that you can line up a bunch of people who could be called scientists and get them to cast doubt on this subject means less than nothing, other than that they should know better. 




 How much do you want to bet that the guy did this on purpose to get some traffic on his website/twitter feed. There are multiple stories about this, many of them on some major sites who link back to his Twitter account.

Seems like $1,200 well spent to me.  




 Here's the trailer fot the movie. 

http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xrv4n3_the-great-imposter-trailer-tony-curtis_shortfilms

Not a bad film, for what it was.  














 Dude, you should Google for Autopen.  









 By the way, this is Percy (Lemon Beagle pup), Charlie (Great Pyrenees) and Samson (Great Pyrenees Mix). 




 To answer your direct question, no, you're not an asshole. You've been doing this job for a year without title or compensation. It's more than reasonable to ask for both. If this wasn't a family situation, nobody would even bat an eye.

Obviously there's a question about timing, but when would be good timing? Are you really expected to wait around until he passes away and then a respectful interval afterwards? That could be years.

And really, after all that, there's no guarantee that they don't find another relative to take over the production manager job. It's a family business. That's how they roll. My wife went without a raise for years because the family-owned company she worked for was short on funds. Not so short on funds that they would get rid of the owner's husband's job, which was essentially a no-show.

Whatever they decide to give you, accept it graciously. Then get your resume together and start looking for a new job. 









 That's awesome. Thanks! 




 My understanding is that the major actors in the film were mislead and not informed of the porn content of the film. The unsimulated sex acts were shot separately from the main action of the film and edited in. 




 The songwriter royalty from an iTunes purchase is roughly 9 cents. That means that Spotify made him the same amount of money as about 140,000 iTunes song sales. If you assume that the average iTunes purchaser listens to their song about a hundred times, that's about the same number of "spins" for the same amount of money.
