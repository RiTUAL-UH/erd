 Does anyone have any articles or information on heart rates that run a little on the high side? I've done some googleing but it's always helpful to see what others have found. 



 




 Decided I want to step it up and work towards trying out for US U23 in a year or two. Bring on the steady state. 




 I don't know what your normal workouts are like but basically yes. And then throw in some extra steady state. So maybe those two workouts and then two days of SS and then weights and whatever other stuff you do, but toned down a bit because you're erging so much. Also these workouts will give you an idea of what to shoot for. Make sure you're negative splitting; it's better for your erg times and your body. 

Also the hardest part about erging is the mentality, so that's probably what you need to work on the most. Even though you know the mental erg struggle, it's been awhile and a 2k is hell. So remember that, and keep your focus while you're erging, especially through the long pieces and the last couple sprint pieces. 




 You just have to work on erging endurance and the best way to do that is by erging. I'd do some (at least four) 500m sprints and then maybe some 3x1k at like a 28 and definitely some steady state (maybe start easy like 2 or 3x15'0 just to get back into the muscle memory of erging). Don't 2k again for another two preferably three weeks.
