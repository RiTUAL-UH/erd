 Looks great! Good to see cities that aren't just grids full of high density low wealth apartment blocks, and then tons of processor/electronics factories (ie. like most of my cities).

As for what you were thinking? Were you hungry for pretzels at the time perchance? 




 I think that's what's happening to one of my cities - 17k low wealth visiting shoppers, and I only have like 5000 low wealth goods for sale (although the number of unsatisfied sims isn't that high actually) 




 Okay, I see it. Should be fixed now, thanks! 




 Most of it was done on a boring Friday afternoon while working (and then a bit after work), and have been slowly adding stuff to it since.

Not too hard if you have Wordpress and access to a good theme.
