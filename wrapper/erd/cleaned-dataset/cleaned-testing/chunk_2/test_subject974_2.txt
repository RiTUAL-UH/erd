 man I love bandcamp - it's given me a new resurgence in love for metal - it's like it was 30 years ago - just browsing the metal section and seeing a tape w/ a killer cover and going for it...can you link me so I can follow you on Bandcamp? 




 NICE!

 Bruschetta.

it's brew-sketta...not broo-shetta. 




 The swing dancing fad of the late '90s / early '00s 




 I guess it's invite only - PM me your email and I'll send you an invite. 




 Farmers Black Market on Facebook.

 Armstrong Grove is right there in G-ville! 




 This has been one of the most enjoyable reading/listening experiences I've ever had.  As I read this book, I would listen to the albums I was reading about in real time on Spotify.  I could hear the evolution of metal as I read.  I did a quick search here and didn't see this book pop up so I wanted to recommend it to my fellow Shredditors.  

a quote: "Me and () had been awake for a pretty long time, drinking, and cutting ourselves, and the whole house we were in was full of vomit and blood."

 I recently picked up Ultimo Mondo Cannibale / Faceless and  Horror Of The Zombies on vinyl from Hells Headbangers on a whim - so glad I did - awesome pioneering stuff! \m/ 




 awesome man, just saw the SF show - CARCASS!!! 




 yea good point - have you heard Vastum though? 




 nice, I might have to make that my next show! and when did Oaktown become such a fucking hipster-fest? I went to the Vastum record release show w/ Christian Mistress at First Church of the Buzzard a few weeks back and it was ridiculous! 




 love Carach! dude, just looked at the line-up for that show - gonna be awesome! 




 dude that's gonna be fucking brutal!!  I just recently picked up a WarpVomit cassette from 20buckspin on a whim - bru-tal.  \m/

 a great highlighter moment from the book...

""Me and () had been awake for a pretty long time, drinking, and cutting ourselves, and the whole house we were in was full of vomit and blood."" 




 "Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult" was one of the best reading experiences I've ever had.  As I read, I would listen to the album/band I was reading about on Spotify in real time and I could hear the evolution of metal as I read - I highly recommend it! 




 "let us pray."
 




 "how much can you bench?"
