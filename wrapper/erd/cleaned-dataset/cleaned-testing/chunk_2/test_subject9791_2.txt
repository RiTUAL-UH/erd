 Much more worth it. Faster, silent, and less power
 




 They are actually two similar cards. Just that the control panel gets weird sometimes

 Right click on desktop --  NVIDIA control Panel 




 Around + 50 to 70% performance gain, depending on the game and if NVIDIA has optimised the drivers for the game 




 Miles better. I barely got 40FPS on Asetto Corsa on FULL settings with the GTX680 SLi. Now I am getting 100++ FPS 




 Which card? I've use the GTX980 reference card and it had no problem 




 You can see at the bottom it's set to the 2nd card 

PhysX - GTX970(2) 




 1. It's at the centre

2. Why would you put a 120Hz monitor on an inferior connection? HDMI won't have the sufficient bandwidth compared to a DVI-D 














 IIRC it's Grand Chelem 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Link_Interface

I based my explanation on this + forums and google. Usually when a new driver is announced by AMD/Nvidia, you can read in the update notes things like 

Optimised (game name here) for SLi/Crossfire

So that's how we can guess the drivers is the one handling the workload.  




 Usually the multi GPU setup is optimised by the drivers which will tell the GPU how to allocate the workload. even if the game is not optimised for multi GPU, the driver will make it work 




 The reaso  for red flag was ambulance on track i think 









 It's called panning. Focus on the subject, use low shutter speed, and burst the trigger while following the car in motion. usually 1 or 2 in 10 of your burst shots would be good enough as with the OP's shot.

These are some of mine

 One of the most dangerous thing i've read on this subreddit 




 Take your nostalgia goggles off. There have been quite a number of good alternatives to GP4 for years now. 

Asetto Corsa and rFactor 2 should be sufficient for the next few years 









 That is one ugly car 




 None. A dead team should stay dead. And crowdfunding is not a feasible answer

 Post the Jenson Button video where his helmet came loose and he has to drive the whole German Grand Prix with only one hand. He was in the Honda at the time 




 http://i.imgur.com/Ac811M4.png

That is the largest gap I've seen ever lol 




 30 car grid is normal considering the old rfactor had unlimited car grid with some hack. you just need a powerful pc to emulate all the cars 




 Luck got him into a front running car.

No. His speed does. That's why McLaren gave him that drive in 2007 instead of de la Rosa which was expected by everyone.  




 their old longer nose would IIRC.  




 rfactor2 mate 




 they have a three year cycle. Windows 7 was RTM in 2009 and replaced by Windows 8 RTM in 2012. Windows 10 should be released in 2015 




 I am sure some are not when they are in McLaren together 




 the first result for googling kl is? 




 isn't this what Brundle was saying when they first had the problem?  




 As the title said "posted on twitter"

 KL apparently 









 Stick shifter on the left masterrace here. I can easily text with my right hand 




 Petronas certainly won't agree on that Mercedes livery. They have a strict white font rule, except on certain cases. Also the shape does not make sense.  




 If i want revenue, i could register as a wiziwig partner and earn loads 




 If a racing team needs fan money to get into the sport, they are doing it wrong. 




 Consider if a Bridgestone runner was close to the back of a michelin runner going to that corner, and the michelin runner just slowed down suddenly, it would be really dangerous 




 Yeah, I am infuriated everytime I hear James Allen in commentary as well 




 You can buy a ticket for the track bus on the three days that will send you from/to either KLCC or KL Sentral

Some nigga hip hop song is better

What you smokin' mate 









 The back straight has a 45% view of the back side of the circuit. I totally recommend sitting here as it's cheaper than the front straight

http://i.imgur.com/vpEhlTx.jpg

Since i live in KL, the track is quite accessible by car, albeit will take a little time to reach there.  




 Win win situation for both honestly. Honda need a team to enter, and McLaren needs an engine manufacturer to back them up after loosing Mercedes monies 




 Tyres, and he was using less fuel than anybody else up to that point 




 Give him any kind of car, and he will drive it. While Alonso can be said to have a similar ability, Hamilton seems to just be able to get in the car, and just drive it, while Alonso might need more time to learn the car. 

I was impressed with Hamilton in 2009. He managed to wring that POS McLaren to places and wins that it was not supposed to have. It might be that during that time he used the car to learn how to drive on the edge, but yet save fuel and save his tyres, two thing that he was really bad at in 2008 and 2007

I still rate Alonso higher as he is the most complete package on the grid today, but I really love Hamilton as the pure racing driver 




 They are busy turning left 




 I think Crofty and Brundle were talking about what can be considered as taking an advantage, and Brundle explained that the stewards would see the sector times and their own racing experience to judge wether or not a driver gains or loses any advantage. 

Since Hamilton lost a lot of time on the first sector, he was deemed to have made a mistake and nothing more was thought of that 




 His highest was third IIRC in 2009 in the most shittiest McLaren ever. Never had much luck since. Usually incidents, and the most weird was the broken third spring that nobody realised in 2011 or 12 









 Was out of stock a month ago. Mine came in a box tho and IIRC this batch does not 




 Limited Edition. I bought the last one from the Real Madrid store 




 Monza 2013. Hamilton has no idea what to do that he pushed till the end. 




 Grand Prix 4, and the ISI's F1 Challenge was the shit back then, especially since I don't have a console 




 Hamilton was generally fine with it last year at Monza 




 It's always funny when English news always regards the second name as the family name, when it's actually patronymic. Bin Ahmad literally means Son of Ahmad 




 Forgot to post the whole thing

 I did say cheap. And honestly what you get in Singapore you can get in JB. except for booze 









 Tip: Stay in Singapore for the race, but go across the causeway for cheap food and everyday stuffs

 I can confirm that Malaysian tickets are cheap. Tickets + accommodations are so cheap that I've met Aussies that skipped the Melbourne race and went to Sepang instead since it meant a cheaper race + holiday package 




 I got mine for RM180ish (Sunday only) for the back straight. That is like, 60USD? 









 In anticipation of BF3 beta, bought two HD6850 thinking it would be enough. After 2 hours, sold it back and bought two GTX570, a new motherboard, and a new casing. 




 They still do. It's just not televised 




 It's hard not to get coverage without ads. Bernie charges A LOT for F1 broadcasting, and stations usually cover this cost by selling ad slots. Sky basically could run the coverage without ads because they can cover up the losses through other channels, and even then you have ads during free practice and qualy, and this is in a country where the F1 viewers are usually high

For North America, where the F1 viewer numbers are usually less than Europe, they have no choice. They have to have the ads. But if you find them too obtrusive, I suggest emailing them and suggeting them to make a side by side window for the ads. There are a lot of other sporting events where the ads are shown at the same time with the main sport. 






















































 F1 has long been dominated by European drivers. But once in a while you would see drivers from other continents, like Australia, South America and North America making a name for themselves in the sports. One continent that has the least amount of drivers competing in the sport is Asia. Currently, only Japan's Kamui Kobayashi is representing Asia in the sport. 

Let's take a look at up and coming prospects from Asia that might one day end up with a race seat in one of the F1 teams in the future

.............................................................................................................................



**Ma Qinghua** (China) - 26 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Unknown*

**Current Drive** Citron Total WTCC (*WTCC*)

The great hope of China, Ma was the Chinese chosen driver for the ill fated A1 Grand Prix series. He has a lot of European single seater race experience under his belt, and was the test driver for HRT and Caterham. Now driving for Citroen in the WTCC series. Is the first Chinese driver to win a WTCC round when he won in Russia

**Chances:** *Slim*   


................................................................................................................................



**Takuya Izawa** (Japan) - 31 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Honda?*

**Current Drive** ART Grand Prix Team (*GP2*)

A former Formula Nippon driver for Team Aguri, Izawa made a name for himself in the Japanese touring car race series, Super GT. Made a jump to European single seater this year as a driver for the highly rated ART Grand Prix team. Has had a lackluster season, but he had his first podium finish in Hungary after Colletti was penalised. 

**Chances:** *Slim (Might end up having a test driver role when Honda joins F1)*   


................................................................................................................................



**Rio Haryanto** (Indonesia) - 21 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Pertamina*

**Current Drive** EQ8 Caterham Racing (*GP2*)

Raced in single seater series in Asia and Australia, Rio made a move to European single seater in 2010 competing in GP3. He was mightily impressive, even winning a race in Turkey, and winning two more races in 2011. Was Max Chilton's partner in GP2. Considered a fast driver, but needs more experience under his belt. He is also the first Indonesian driver to qualify for a Superlicense. 

**Chances:** *Moderate (Pertamina might buy him a seat in the future)*   


................................................................................................................................



**Kimiya Sato** (Japan) - 24 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Unknown*

**Current Drive** Campos Racing (*GP2*), Euronova Racing (*AutoGP*)

A young and upcoming driver from the land of the rising sun, Kimiya amazingly started his single seater career in the UK with the Formula BMW racing series before going back to Japan. He was the runner's up in the 2009 All Japan Formula 3 National series, before making the trip back to Europe to join the Formula 3 Euro Series. Runners up in the AutoGP championship last year, and now racing in both GP2 and AutoGP. Currently leading the AutoGP championship, but having a torrid time in GP2. 

**Chances:** *High (Honda might find him the best bet to give a racing seat to a Japanese driver)*   


................................................................................................................................



**Sean Gelael** (Indonesia) - 17 y/o

**Sponsors:** *KFC Indonesia*

**Current Drive** Jagonya Ayam with Carlin (*F3*)

This young driver from Indonesia made a fast rise in his career. Only started professional racing in 2011, racing in the Asian Kartin series where he finished third. Wasting no time he moved to Europe just two years later competing in Formula 3. Currently in his second year of F3. Still has yet to show his rumoured potential.  

**Chances:** *Moderate/Low (Unless he shows results in the next few years, it's doubtful that he could break into F1, especially since Carlin is one of the best racing team in single seater. Considering that his sponsors is not really a traditional name in motorsports, they are most likely not to pay for his F1 seat)*   


................................................................................................................................



**Jazeman Jaafar** (Malaysia) - 21 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Petronas*

**Current Drive** ISR Racing (*Formula Renault 3.5*), HTP Motorsports (*Blancpain GT Series - One off race*)

Malaysia's hope for the future, Jazeman competed in karting in both Malaysia and Europe. Was one of the few drivers given a special leeway when he wanted to join Formula BMW Asia due to his really young age. Won the championship in hist first year, he then moved to Europe, competing with Raikkonen Robertson Racing. He then moved to Carlin to drive for their Formula 3 team. Had a lackluster two years before finishing second in British F3 in 2012. He then moved to Formula Renault 3.5 for again Carlin, before he moved to ISR Racing this year. Has a couple of podium in Monaco and Spa as well as finishing 5th in the Spa 24 hour race this year with HTP Motorsports.

**Chances:** *Moderate/High (A Petronas Motorsports development talent and might be given the test seat for Mercedes due to the close relationship with Petronas Motorsports and Mercedes)*

FAQ

**What is this?**

It's a *free* streaming site that I use to stream sports from my home. I actually use it so that I can watch my own TV when I am at the office, as I usually work 10~12 hours a day 

**What will you be streaming?**

Sports, mostly football and motorsports. Priorities for Formula 1 and Arsenal, in that order.

**What is the quality of your stream?**

Due to location (I am in Asia, and I am streaming it to a Ustream server in the USA) I limit the stream to 720p, 25fps, 1.5Mbps. 

**Why Ustream and not (insert the streaming choice of my liking)**

Because it's easy, and it can be watched by everyone no matter if they are on a PC or on a mobile phone. Also they are a bit lax on DMCA takedown. And if my stream do get taken down, registering another account is really easy. Also it's the fastest non pay RTMP streaming service that I have tested

**What is the channel source?**

Malaysian cable sports channel. So you won't get the same pre/post match thing that you would expect or get from UK channels. Also be prepared for last minute changes and fuck ups. 

**Are you making any monies from this?**

I do put some google ads on the site, but I don't actually care, as the monies from the ads can barely pay the monthly fees for internet and cable tv here. Also doing this to help fellow Gooners and F1 fans

If you guys have any questions or request, go on ahead! 









 Now that the summer break is here, how would you rate the drivers up till now?

Nico Rosberg

Calm, smart, and calculating. Took his chances and took it well. It's not surprising that he is leading the championship. But if there is an achilles heel, it's that he needs all of his engineers input to make his driving faster, and IMO this is what could derail his championship run at the end of the season


Lewis Hamilton

Definately the driver to watch. He is unlucky not to be leading the championship. But honestly the two drivers from the back of the grid to the podium in Germany and Hungary was the drives of the season. For the people who disagree, I would like to remind you that he drove in Germany with brakes that he hates, and in Hungary with a rebuilt car that he have no idea how it feels. He could still pip Nico at the end of the season


Daniel Ricciardo

Revelation of the season. Calm and adapted to life in the Red Bull like duck to water. If it's not for the Mercedes total domination, he could be up there fighting for the championship. Next year he will definately be closer tho. Expect more wins to come this season yet.


Seb Vettel

The loss of the blown diffuser hits him more than any other drivers on the grid. Still not being able to adapt to the new car, nevertheless he has been calm and mature. Other than the "tough luck" moment earlier in the season, he is quite okay with his teammate being faster. Might end up finding his form again after the season resumes


Nando Alonso

Best driver in the grid in not the best car on the grid. Flatters the Ferrari more than it actually should. The second half of the season would see if he stays at Ferrari or find a better team. 


Kimi Raikkonen

Struggling. That is the only way to describe him this season. And his bad back is definately not helping. Add to Ferrari's questionable tactics and strategy he finds himself in places he should not be at in the first place. Might be his last season in F1.


Valterri Bottas

Next great Finnish hope. Finished the half season with a lot of good drives. Took his chances and shows that he is faster than his much older teammate. If Williams can find more speed in the car, then he could find himself a win in the second half of the season, especially if the Mercs trips over each other


Felipe Massa

Guy can't seem to find a break. His bad luck, especially at the start of races seems to be much more worse than Hamilton's. Struggling to keep pace with his teammate


Jenson Button

Missing Hamilton's setup input. Does not help the McLaren is shit. With the departure of Whitmarsh, his place in the team is also under threat as Ron is not really his largest fan. Might be his last season with the team, unless he can turn his season around


Kevin Magnussen

Started the season with a podium but slid back. Shows some flashes of speed. But still does not show anything special, yet.
 
























 After seeing all of these 60FPS jokes on the console peasants, I was thinking, does it really matters to everyone here personally?

 











































































































































 http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10158756

Only selected races were recorded by me due to various reasons

- No race 1-3, as I had not acquired a capture card when it aird
- No race 10, as my cable provider did not air the Friday's race, and never aired a repeat of it.

All races are in 720p, 50FPS, at around 5mbps bitrate.

Enjoy 














 I mean honestly, year after year they would always amaze me. No matter what kind of rules that are thrown at them, there will be always someone, somewhere that can find a solution to the problem, and will be then copied down the grid. 

After 5 races, I can see the car can potentially be as fast as last year, and considering how much the FIA are restricting the downforce and aero, this is no mean feat. 














 It's interesting to see that everytime the fuel graphics comes out, it's Lewis Hamilton (and to some extent, the Williams) that is using the least fuel than anyone else during a race weekend.

This combined with the ability to still post competitive time is really quite amazing considering that people says he is an "all out driver". This could play into his hand later in the year if he needs some more power when push comes to shoves 



















 Tuned in to GP3, and found out the track is damp. This might change the race later today as tyre wear will worsen
