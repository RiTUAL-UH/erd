 It's appreciated all the same, though proper grammar is also incredibly flattering to me! 




 I believe in the first I was 13, the second I was 15 or so? Most recent, 25. 




 :) 




 My really pretty what? 




 Foggy, clear Converse. That sounds awful! 




 Aw, thank you :) 




 Yep! I remember refusing to participate in swim class in high school and my gym teacher made me do laps walking around the pool. He also gave me a VHS of [My First Mister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E24SGpVrs-s) because the girl in it reminded him of me. In retrospect, it was kind of creepy that he put that much thought into it, and the title is kind of wtf. 




 Note the fanny pack in the first photo... I don't even know what to say about those earrings, either. Heh, I remember he used to joke around and wear my **scrunchies** and jokingly call himself "Tina" in order to mess with my cousin and me... How he turned out to be a *relatively normal* human being is beyond me.

He also was diagnosed with [vitiligo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo) when he was a freshman in high school. He used to get picked on a lot because he wore makeup to cover the blotches. He was able to stop the progression of it by doing radiation, I believe. By the time he graduated, he was one of the most popular kids in high school. Complete 180. 




 I thought it would never happen. I still feel like that frumpy little girl who got picked on constantly... Thank you!  




 Thank you! :) 









 I did! The fist photo you can kind of see them. Derp. 




 I did say "wannabe" 









 I think that's what makes it so fantastic. It can be kind of boring at first, but the last half makes it totally worth the wait, imho. 




 Wow, Chris Rock is totally the guy watering the flowers... What an odd celebrity placement! 




 These guys are called [Spongmonkeys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spongmonkeys) and they originated on a website called [rathergood.com](http://www.rathergood.com/moon_song). 














 Fun Fact: While Jim Cummings did not play Kaa, the voice of Kaa *was indeed* [the voice of Winnie the Pooh](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001359/?ref_=tt_cl_t5) before Jim Cummings! 




 That's a huntsman spider... They're harmless, albeit freaky as all hell:

 I want this beautiful creature to exist IRL 




 Hey! You're one of the few girls that can be compared to a hippo without it actually being an insult (perhaps)...

Hippopotamus also sweat red! Their sweat is much more viscous and works as a natural sunblock. Maybe you're just more evolutionarily advanced!

  Migas

It's so easy to make, but damn it, I want it SERVED and I want everyone to know its glory. 




 But SHOULD I be worried? 




 Not true, I've seen my fair share of sexy ginger men!  




 They don't have to be a species to become extinct...

 Should I be worried for having big ocular cups? It is the only cup size that's big and I hear it can be a sign of ocular degeneration. *weep* 




 DAMN IT. I fucking love Migas and NO ONE in Boston has it or knows wtf it is. I miss the food in Texas :( 




 They are thought to become extinct within the next, um, 50 years or so? Shame.... Redheads make me swooooooon 




 Man, sometimes I miss living in Austin, but damn do they have messed up politics. I miss sneaking into deep eddy at night for swims, though. 




 Dude. Duolingo is a great language app to start with!  




 Do you have any hilarious phobias? 




 A man after my own heart 




 What was it like for you playing in a role like "Maniac"? It seems quite different than your usual roles (well, except maybe for the pantie snatcher in Eternal Sunshine)... It was an interesting POV, too!

Also, fuck Macaulay Culkin in "The Good Son".  




 The Craft 




 NOOOOOOOOOO I MISSED THIS?!

*weep* 




 Do either of you ever feel like, after 4 seasons, you're beating a dead horse? Ever consider moving on to a new region/theme/niche? 

Also, while I'm sure you're all incredibly appreciative of the reception you've gotten for Portlandia, do either of you regret any particular skits or aspects of the show? 
I have a ton of tattoos inspired by biology/zoology and I'm particularly fond of birds, but I am so sick of hearing "Put a bird on it." I'm curious if either of you ever have experiences like that... 









 Brilliant concept   execution! 




 Just getting into traditional media, I'm a bit rusty but I saw these blank watercolor postcards at the art supply store and decided they would be a good way to practice and make nice gifts! 









 Sardinia, Tuscany, Umbria, Palermo and Venice  




 MATT MURPHY'S. Seriously. A free half dozen 5p-7p on Monday's or until sold out. If you order food or a drink and you're generally likeable, they'll keep em coming on request. 




 Dorchester. Cheap rent, close to downtown and on the red line... It's hood, sure, but it's gentrifying. Fields corner isn't bad at all, tbh. 




 Came here to say this. Was not disappointed. 




 Have you read Bill Murray's IAMA about Garfield? Priceless....

Also, if Nicholas Cage isn't continuing to act for the sake of trolling alone, I'd have to say "no"

 Where do you live?
I think DMT is a much more profound experience than LSD... I've never done DMT, but from what I've heard and seen in documentaries, it is WAY more spiritually heavy than LSD, which is usually just a 'fun' thing to experience while still having some profound moments.
