 I actually find this interesting cause I have also found that (in my limited experience) that most of the discrimination towards me has come from other women.  




 Yeah my first job while I was still studying was as first level support on an IT helpdesk, and clients would ring up and assume that I was the receptionist and when I explained I wasn't and I was there to help them, sometimes they would still ask to speak to 'one of the boys'. I'd have to tell them that they were busy and ask again how I could help them. The guys were more experienced than me but 95-99% of client requests I was able to fix myself. 




 Being punched in the throat sucks, but I don't know that I'd like being punched in the boobs/chest either. Are they meant to punch you there? 




 Yeah that's tough. I had a friend who was in a similar situation as you. Some of the older female teachers were quite unfriendly. What level of teaching will you be doing? 




 I am a female in IT. I chose this field because I enjoy it, and it turns out I am good at it. I am not concerned about the gender bias because I feel my qualifications and experience speak for themselves, and so far that has been the case (the only time I have been discriminated against it has not affected my career progress). However, I'm relatively inexperienced and I would love to know other people's experiences in similar environments. 




 I will read, and then if I am feeling energetic still, I will write a list of all the things I have to do the next day, and the thought of that sometimes makes me mentally exhausted and I nod off. Plus if you're like me and think about all your problems, planning out the next day gives you something else to think about besides the problems. I also find that coming on the computer usually makes me stay up longer, so using it right before bed is often not a good idea for me if I'm trying to sleep.  




 Yes! I hate it when people do that on travelators and moving walkways too. Those things take so goddamn long. There's a shopping center near me and they have one on every level. Drives me crazy going there. It's 5 floors but if I know I'm going to the top level I take the carpark stairs instead.  




 I would probably call a pest controller. Then you can try to seal up/remove/clear clutter from any places where they are likely to hide. That is pretty hard when they hide in garden beds though I guess, but hopefully they won't go in your house. 




 Well that is bad timing. Just don't do what this guy did and leave his trousers on the floor between gardening sessions: http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23002709-5013016,00.html

 I was in a hotel in NYC a while back using the net in the narrow hallway cause the hotel signal didn't reach my room. This random creepy guy came past and asked me if I wanted to join the "party" in his room (with one other guy). I didn't use the net in the hallway anymore after that.   




 We recently had our headlamps replaced in our Toyota 4WD with some crappy ones when they broke. I don't think they were a genuine part, or they were 2nd hand. We drive about a 6-8hr drive (each way) at least 2 times a year in winter to go down south on highways and so we have to drive part of the way at night usually (cause we are slow getting away). The high beam on the old headlamps was really bad - I nearly hit a few dead kangaroos because of this. We got them replaced again with brand new ones after some scary driving experiences and it was HEAPS better - I could see at least 10 times as far. Didn't need HID lights, and I don't know why anyone really would need them. Definitely recommend replacing with the regular lights first before trying annoying HID lights. 




 I thought that the sound of thunder was the result of giants bowling in the sky on top of the clouds. 




 Is the $3 for a one way fare? Our tickets just went up today too. I used to pay AU$9.60 or sometihng like that for a return ticket to work on the train from my parents (approx 25km), but now it's AU$10 (USD$8.96/CAD$9.41) return. 

Bus isn't much better. When I'm at my city place (approx 5km from work), it costs me AU$2.60 each way on the bus.

I feel so ripped off.  




 We have trains here (Sydney). Then after 1am or something like that, they have nightride buses for most of the major train lines. Do you have anything like that once the subway stops or do you get stranded in the city/downtown?
 




 I think the gang-rape thing happened once or twice, and it hit newspapers pretty hard. I don't remember it being like a common trend. Most of those guys got decent prison sentences for the really bad rape, but some of them got away pretty lightly. 

The beach thing that happened was really disappointing. I definitely think the media fulled that incident, and I think most of the locals disapproved but there are idiots everywhere and sometimes it only takes a few. I definitely think there was a problem there long before this happened, and I think there still is. I honestly don't know what the solution is. Most of the guys are just stupid teenagers/young adults and are showing off to their friends in the most intolerable ways possible.
 




 I live in Sydney too. 

I agree about the people being rude. It's amazing how lonely you can feel with so many people around. I live and work in the city, but it is a bit stressful sometimes and I miss the open space that I have at my parents in the suburbs. Even then it's not as nice out there as it used to be, since the bush is now all gone and new housing developments went up when I was a kid. I remember when we used to go to the shopping centre everyone knew each other and we couldn't go through without mum having a million conversations... I used to think grocery shopping took forever... but now I realise we had it good. It's not like that as much anymore. 

Sure there are crowds at big events, but then again you don't have to go if you don't like that sort of thing. There are quite a few jerks around that just don't care about anyone else's experience, so you have to learn a great deal of tolerance and not let it get to you, otherwise you can never enjoy yourself. That said, sometimes it's hard to ignore. I went out to dinner one night (kind of late - 11pm), and saw 3 people throw up in the street while we were walking to the restaurant (in the space of one block). I was kind of glad we were too late to get food from for the restaurant. If you are with a group of friends and can ignore it, the atmosphere can be great (as long as you know the best spot to go). 

With the immigration, I agree there's a problem there in terms of people actively not wanting to be part of Australian society. Obviously I am glad some people have cultural identity, and can feel like they belong somewhere, but so often I feel like some have no respect for any other race or culture aside from their own, and often do try to intimidate you so they can force some sort of feeble excuse for respect from you. It's not like that everywhere in Sydney, and I think you can have a completely different experience and quality of life if you live in a nicer suburb as you suggested. I think that's like a lot of large cities as well, and because I haven't lived anywhere very long term I don't know enough to say that other places are any better. I'd like to think they would be though.

I used to go surfing a bit when I was younger and nowadays I don't like it so much. I used to go to Cronulla (where the riots happened a few years back) quite regularly. I had some problems myself long before that incident. I don't like city beaches much anymore. Especially after finding 3 syringes in the sand on separate occasions. That all said I will still go surfing and for most of the time (not hot ones cause those are the days that attract the idiots), it is a nice place. Advice tho: wear thongs   don't build sandcastles far away from the water's edge cause the rubbish tractors don't clear the edges of the beach very well.  

I used to love Sydney because I thought it had everything - beautiful harbour, beautiful beaches, convenient local area shopping centers, good restaurants, good nightlife, multiculturalism, etc. - but as I get older and see more of Sydney I think sometimes I feel that the things I dislike about it are outweighing the benefits as well. 

I have really mixed feelings about this place, and so often I do feel like I hate it. I definitely want to get out and experience other places as well. 

 




 My biggest fear is making a mess of my life, and screwing it up so bad I will lose everyone and everything that matters, and will eventually die alone with my own self pity and regret. 




 Shakespeare had a lot of themes in his plays, like greed, guilt, temptation, love, hate, revenge, forgiveness, violence, jealousy, etc. Maybe if you can pick a theme that interests you it might be a starting point for some ideas. (Oh, and I'm not saying to do a shakespeare style play or anything like that... just to get some ideas).

Otherwise what would interest your audience? Or you? What's something you've learned in life, or a interesting event that has happened? Anything interesting you've learned from someone else?  




 We were out watching fireworks a few years back and after they end the city goes crazy with drunks everywhere. I saw this girl and guy fighting, after which the guy punches her in the face. Probably cause she is a bit drunk she falls straight from her feet onto her head on the curb, with no arm out or anything. I hear this loud cracking noise as her head hits the curb, and the guy walks off, leaving her with her friend. The girl was probably okay because I heard her screaming and crying after she fell. I saw some police nearby who are stopping people from going on the bridge. I walked up to the first one and explained what happened a few meters away and asked if he could call an ambulance. He explained he was too busy watching the bridge. I walked over to the other cop working with him who was clearly the more senior cop and he called an ambulance. Not blaming the cop they were probably overwhelmed but that was a weird thing to see. 




 I think this time she should get all the cash. Maybe next time half :P 




 Explosive Diarrhea 




 I have this (Lite White):
http://www.dairyfarmers.com.au/df/ourproductsandrecipes/milk/dairyfarmersbrlitewhite

I used to hate skim milk but I am lactose intolerant so I get sick drinking full cream milk now. But I can drink this and it tastes good. 

I should get a job advertising this milk. 




 When I was a kid, my sister and I thought it was a great idea to eat hot two minute noodles (including the boiling water) on the trampoline. It was decided I would get up there first, she'd pass me the bowl (which I held on my lap), and then she'd get up afterwards, and we could enjoy noodles and trampolining concurrently.

I burnt my whole right upper leg and spent a few weeks sitting down and having this white cooling cream applied to the burns.  




 The OP annoyed the Twatty guy, who got up in anger and asked the rhetorical question "Do you know who my father is?" as if implying he is a man of great influence or importance, and someone not to be messed with. 

By interpreting the question non-rhetorically you could assume the person really doesn't know who their father is. The OP uses this to offend the Twatty guy by responding with "No. Have you tried asking your mother?" and implying that the mother either slept around or was no longer involved with the father of the Twatty guy.

I'm not great with explanations but hopefully that clears it up. 




 You're welcome! Happy New Year! 




 Looks like you're there! :P 




 Most of my debt is from FEE-HELP/HECS. 




 The only big accident I've had was reversing into my sister's car from the garage cause the outside light was broken and my car is a bit chunky at the back and I didn't look properly. 

Then after this, instead of getting out to check the damage, I drove forward again to separate the cars and pulled out some pipe full of oil that my tow bar had got stuck under. The car was spurting oil all over the driveway. Oh god I'm stupid. 




 Read the news, learn about other ways of life, meet non-US born people and learn some of the other countries' history.

I think learning history will make you appreciate other cultures more, and the things they have done in the past and present.

Also I liked doing charity volunteering a little while ago just on a few occasions, but for the few days I did it, the whole time I was thinking about how little people in these other places had and how much capacity we have to give.  




 Thanks. That's both disgusting and informative. 

Wouldn't wearing socks mean your feet don't dry properly though and you would make the bacteria growth worse? I mean even if I dry my feet with a towel I like to let them air a little bit before putting on socks or shoes. 




 My cousin is like this. He wouldn't eat anything besides meat and rice. My dad used to always ask him if he was constipated. 




 Same with me. I couldn't have any type of cheese unless it was melted on toast or pizza. Then I was introduced slowly to all different types of cheese and I realised that there are a billion types of cheese besides tasty cheese and those cheese sticks which I still think are gross! 

I still don't like all cheese but sometimes cheese just makes a sandwich or a meal! :) 




 Did you get an invite? I have a friend who's been on reddit for 2 months but won't be able to join cause apparently it's too short :(

It sucks cause he's the one who introduced me to reddit, he just didn't sign up for ages! 




 I sent you something small to say thanks! You started something awesome on reddit! :) 




 They have a minimum length of membership too. :( 




 I usually find a comment that says the same thing I would say and upvote it - otherwise you would have 1000 comments that are exactly the same, and that's kind of boring to read. 




 This is awesome. Thank you! Merry Christmas :) 




 I just found this. Thanks! 




 State: New South Wales 




 Cronulla. They upgraded the STP back in 1998 - haven't had any more ear infections since luckily. It used to be the dirtiest beach water in Sydney before that. 

One of my friends mum's also used to surf and now has permanent ear problems from getting ear infections, so I'm glad nothing permanent has happened to me.  




 SMH:
[http://www.smh.com.au/national/skydiver-dead-after-13th-jump-20091128-jxz5.html](http://www.smh.com.au/national/skydiver-dead-after-13th-jump-20091128-jxz5.html)

I think a couple of people die every year out there. I would freak out at that particular place cause they get dropped out right near the highway. I've seen some guys get pretty close to the traffic. 




 Yeah I used to get quite a few ear infections before they upgraded the sewage treatment plant.  




 I've swum there! I'm still more scared of [box jellyfish](http://www.barrierreefaustralia.com/the-great-barrier-reef/jellyfish.htm) than great whites, because with box jellyfish:
 

 You have virtually no chance of surviving the venomous sting, unless treated immediately. The pain is so excruciating and overwhelming that you would most likely go into shock and drown before reaching the shore. 









 I think some of it is to do with attitude towards a problem. 

The bigger the learning curve the more fear you have I.e. the bigger the perceived 'hardness'.

Sometimes learning something new can be really hard, because you might not have all the necessary background knowledge or know the terminology, and so at first you don't take it in. If you persist with it long enough and get past this point, the result can be really rewarding. 

I sometimes think maybe people have found something hard, began working on it but not persisted long enough to get the reward. So the next time they see a problem, they have an even bigger mental barrier because they didn't feel the satisfaction from last time. If this is a problem, at least for me I found the best thing to do is break it down into parts and then each time you understand a part you will feel a bit better - trying to understand a huge problem in one go can be really demotivating. 




 I went out with a guy that smoked and I didn't let him do it around me. I didn't break up with him, but I still didn't like it.

I don't consider objecting to someone else smoking as being controlling - more that you care about that person and don't want them to get addicted, waste money or damage their health. In reality, I could never stop him from smoking - he could just do it behind my back - but I did tell him how I felt about it and in the end he made his own decision to quit. 




 * Like this magnet on metal we joining together,
So make sure you're there when we make it forever.

* You might remember this date in your head,
But to be safe here's a magnet with the date we will wed.

* We'd love you to be attending our wedding, 
So here's a magnet so you don't go forgetting.

* Put this magnet somewhere you'll remember,
The date we'll make our vows together!

* This invitation has a magnetic field,
To make sure you're there when we seal the deal! 




 Don't you get cockroaches or insects? I live in a unit - if I left dishes out the cockroaches would come from all the other units and infest my place.  




 I don't expect everyone to smile back or that they are necessarily depressed cause they don't smile back, but I like it when they do.  




 It's for the buses. You buy ten trips in advance on Sydney Buses, and put it into the green ticket reader box when you get on a bus and it reads the magnetic strip and prints the trip on the back (bus number and time). They've been around for a while but you didn't have to use them before.
See the [Transport Infoline Website](http://www.131500.com.au/faresandpasses/sydneybuses_travelten.asp). Looks like [this](http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/object3/1528/118/n91760107804_3407.jpg) - non-concession adult has white instead of yellow background. 




 Everyone poops! If you didn't paint her walls with your poop I don't see any problem. Besides that, I guess it's her fault if her walls are so thin she can hear.
 
I can think of a few things you can do though:

A) You can try turning on the tv or radio beforehand if possible. Then just let it rip. Flush it and act like nothing happened. Avoid going near the bathroom for a while.

B) Get her to go to the toilet first and then act subtly disgusted and pretend like it sounded/smelt horrible. Then she'll be so worried about how horrible her poo was she won't even care if yours sounds/smells bad. 

C) Show her how awesome the poo you just did was. 




 Friendliness. Where I live people can be pretty unfriendly, and I hardly see people smile... it's kind of sad. I try to smile at people (whenever it's not weird) and I really like it when people smile back. :)  




 It's kind of hard to notice things when you live here cause it happens so slowly when you're here. Here's a few things I can think of off the top of my head:

* The Harbour Bridge and some other places are now cashless. You need one of those e-tags to cross it now. I hate toll roads. 

* Buses around the city require you to have a travel 10 to get on/off buses during peak periods (I think it's 7am-7pm but I can't remember), so you can't pay cash to travel. I think this is probably a good thing but most people who travel regularly get Travel 10s anyway cause they're cheaper. 

* There was some stuff going on with Bikie Gangs which is still happening. They [bludgeoned some guy to death at the domestic terminal](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/30/2530292.htm). 

* The international airport (departure) was getting upgraded and had barely any food in the food court there. It sucks to hang around at before a flight. [Due to finish 2010](http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/sacl/International-Terminal---Expansion-and-Upgrade.html).

* If you're already in Australia this won't make any difference but here anyway - 
[Utility costs have gone up](http://www.switzer.com.au/latest-news/news-stories/record-lift-in-utility-charges-proves-inflation-bogy/): 
Utility charges rose by a record (37 years) 10.2 per cent in the September quarter. Utility charges rose by 13.4 per cent over the year  the biggest increase in 26 years.

* Pitt Street mall is going through an upgrade. Not a very pretty sight at the moment (not that it really was before).

* RTA penalties for speeding have changed a few times now. P platers have zero alcohol limit now, and there are some new anti-hoon laws. 

* More and more school zones have flashing lights now when it is 40km/h

* God damn birds! I used to open my balcony window in the mornings, but the miner birds are trying to nest, and a pair flew into my unit (I'm on the 4th floor), as did a pigeon. Pigeons at least are pretty predictable and so that one just kept flying at the window trying to get out. I caught it with a towel and let it out. Then a few days later some miner birds flew in and were scared shitless of me, so shitless, they shat all over my unit. I had bird poop everywhere. This, along with the time a turkey tried to steal my lunch, now mean I only like some birds. 
 




 I hate cyclists mainly because of their outfits. How streamlined do they really need to be? I want to hold my food down. 




 Thanks for this article. I heard so many different opinions and didn't really understand what was going on. It makes more sense now.  




 From the Telegraph: [link](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/grant-edward-brown-refused-bail-after-being-charged-with-unprovoked-attack-on-circular-quay-to-manly-ferry/story-e6freuy9-1225798655514)

**Grant Edward Brown refused bail after being charged with unprovoked attack on Circular Quay to Manly ferry**

*November 17, 2009 3:31PM*


A PERSONAL trainer accused of striking a 70-year-old man in the head in a bout of unprovoked violence on a Manly ferry has been refused bail for the protection of the community.

Grant Edward Brown, 31, was charged with recklessly wounding after the incident on the Queenscliff ferry shortly after it left Circular Quay at 6pm yesterday.

Police allege Brown, visiting from Tasmania, struck John Edward Lane once to the face, causing him to fall heavily and his head hit the ground.

Documents tendered to Central Local Court this afternoon have revealed Brown was allegedly talking loudly and aggressively on a telephone shortly before the incident.

To the unknown person on the phone, Brown allegedly said: If someone on this ferry gets their head punched in, it will be on you.

A short time later, he was allegedly acting aggressively, kicking walls and bins before a companion of Mr Lanes then alleged approached him and told him to calm down.

He refused, threatening to bash your head in.

When Mr Lane then interjected urging him to relax as well, he was told: Step away, I swear Im going to punch your f***ing head in.

He then allegedly struck Mr Lane with a closed fist, causing the victim to fall to the ground and strike his head on the deck.

Witnesses have told police of seeing a large amount of blood and then hearing the accused man become hysterical: Someone help him, someone help him.

Magistrate Allan Moore refused the Tasmanian bail, saying he was not satisfied that the community would be safe if he was released to bail.

The case will be re-mentioned on Friday.
 




 Sure they have good facilities but how come it still looks so grey and work-like :( 




 I'm not sure if you mean modern day or older times, but for people who really travelled long distances, look up the older explorers from before the 19th century. 

You can start with this [list of explorers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_explorers) on Wikipedia. 




 Do you live under a bridge? 




 This is good but more relevant for essays and reports I think. 




 Those are pretty good. I like the [single fork](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-9.jpg), [can lid](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-14.jpg) and the [bee](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-33.jpg).  




 Yeah that's the difference. Ours get a decent wage so we don't have to tip. 

I also only recently learned you have to tip in Canada too. I thought they had the same system as Australia. 
 




 Does it vary from place to place or is it the same all over the US?
 




  Try to die in a month when the demand for funeral services is low.  Perhaps the summer or a temperate spring.  Your loved ones may get a good deal that way.

Okay I'll do my best. 




 Some of the first shots at night are a bit too dark to really see anything, or from different angles. The later ones are good. It's interesting to see most things haven't changed that much though. 




 Did it taste like Fanta?  




 Can someone explain to me how tipping works?

I gathered this:

Most places: 15%

Small towns: 10%

NYC: 20%

And then is it 5% either side of that if you liked or didn't like the service?
 




 My uncle went on the Queen Elizabeth II cruise ship and it was all you can eat all the time. He said there were some americans that had the following meals (each with a full buffet style serving):

* Breakfast

* Morning Tea

* Brunch

* Lunch

* Afternoon Tea

* Dinner (Entres included)

* Dessert

* Supper

When they docked they didn't have enough time to unload all the human waste - there were trucks lining up to take away the sewerage, so the ship left with still plenty of gunk on board.

He is not young (75+) and he said they were the fattest people he'd seen in his life. 




 Yeah :( 

It took me ages to notice too cause I always stare out the window. I only noticed once we went into the tunnels and I saw his reflection in the window.  




 I get the train and the bus, and I don't like public transport because:

* It's expensive

* It's slow

* If the buses fills up they don't stop to let passengers on. So you can't rely on it to get you somewhere on time. The next bus might not be for another 20 minutes.

* Has sick people spreading their illnesses

* It's uncomfortable and crowded - sometimes I can't get a seat and have to stand up, and sometimes I get squished by someone, I also do my groceries and have to carry them on my lap because someone decided to sit next to me with all my groceries instead of one of the other free chairs.

* It's dirty - people always leave their rubbish on the train, especially the later ones after peak hour.

* Bad experiences - a guy once jerked off next to me on the train.


I still catch public transport only because

* It's still slightly cheaper than driving

* The train can be faster than driving in peak hour

I sometimes stay near work and just walk to work, but it is 4km over fairly hilly terrain and can be a little tiring after a long work day, and not that safe. 




 The rule only applies to diagraphs ([link](http://alt-usage-english.org/I_before_E.html)). 




 Or nutella and banana! 




 Fair enough, I guess I found it hard to know what to buy. I half expected that multi grain bread would be just savoury type bread with grains in it, but it was heaps sweet. We don't have any bread that is sweet in the supermarket. Maybe if I went with an American they could have shown me what to buy.  




 I just went to a regular supermarket.  




 Don't worry about that! Just go for it! Have a little faith in yourself. The more obstacles you overcome the more confidence you'll gain, and things will hopefully become easier for you the more experience and knowledge you get. 




 I have always had pretty clear skin, but acne never bothered me on anyone else.

My ex had a lot of acne. When he got older it just went away naturally. He got a face peel done and it looked like he'd never had acne in the first place.  




 oink oink 




 I think what's gross is how pretty much all American food has a high concentration of sugar. For example, bread, cheese, breakfast cereals. The cheese from a regular supermarket there actually tastes like McDonalds cheese, and the bread is like lolly bread. Where do Americans go to buy savoury things, or things with no sugar?  




 I love avocados! 




 I think the US has the largest meal sizes for McDonalds. It's bad enough in the small sizes but the big sizes are just sickening (yet somehow still tasty). 

Their small meal size is equivalent to our medium, and their medium is our large. I'm not sure if a US-sized large McDonalds meal even exists here. 




 Does anyone actually finish their plate there? I've been to the US a couple of times now and I never finished a meal. They were like family sized servings. 




 I don't think your host family is representative of the rest of Australia. We eat pumpkin plenty. But we just don't normally make it into a pie. 




 Sorry, I have no idea. I'm not in that area. I'd need the name of the article to find it. Can you remember the author or journal name? Maybe try a search there. If you can find an link online that's even better. 




 Did you have to pee when you woke up? 




 Bleach is the way to go. Just make sure the room is well ventilated.

Also [DON'T mix bleach and ammonia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/classic/A795611). It produces toxic gases. Ammonia is contained in some household cleaners ([link](http://www.npi.gov.au/database/substance-info/profiles/pubs/ammonia.pdf)).

  




 This is all John West's fault. We don't have to have the best!! All tuna is excellent. 




 Take lunch breaks. For my first job I didn't. You need that - even 15 minutes - to just have a break and calm/de-stress yourself.

 Good Irish Yodel Farts? 




 Go in for the kiss and when she closes her eyes to wait for it, slap on some wax and let it rip! She'll thank you later. 




 Bad timing 




 A table was standing next to two stacked chairs. A gnome wearing a pointy hat was learning how to dance. He took three steps right and knocked the chairs off their neat stack. 




 Also good if you're paying for part of a meal shared with friends. Then you can just round up the amount to the nearest whole note you have.
