 They are satan. 




 Thank you for educating a young fellow like I. 




 It's in the old one though, by the way. Not the new one that just came out. 




 I do like the warped vocals of Ocean Man, and some of their songs aren't too appealing. I would suggest [Mutilated Lips] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzIHkFJnLbc) if you haven't heard it 




 Yeah, it's the outro song as the credits are playing. 




 Practice wife? 




 I personally haven't seen much *hate*, more of just people wanting Surf and getting frustrated. No one on this Subreddit could hate Chance really. 









 2:44 AM, ~4,000 views from 1,000,000. Currently on my 3^rd listen. 




 Definitely a close 2^nd for me. 




 People do crazy things when they're desperate. 




 Oh what the fucking dicks.

One of my favourite songs off "The Mollusk" that was released in 1997. And yes, I did find them off of the Spongebob Movie. 




 I'm interpreting the line "Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment are gearing up to drop their debut album, *Surf*, this week featuring Chance the Rapper." as in that they are gearing up this week for the release. Not that they are *releasing* Surf this week, but that they are *preparing* for the drop. 




 I'm decently sure you can't do that 




 I'm glad I could turn you on to them. They're one of my favourite brands as of now 




 I didn't know people resold Greats' shoes lol 









 I just rock a 3/5 Fade. At least that's what I call it. Nothing fancy

 Can someone please explain this 




 Considering neither #10Day nor Acid Rap were on vinyl, I would assume that the answer is no (rather sadly, might I add). However, this *is technically* Donnie's project that Chance has a big part in. So, we won't know until it happens.
