 I did half-GOMAD about a year or so ago and it definitely did work. The biggest problem is trying to adapt to a normal diet afterwards - milk doesn't really stretch your stomach that much and I found that I actually lost weight when I tried to switch back to solid foods as I couldn't eat as many solid calories. 




 Fun fact, I work in insurance and when you allow your email to be shared with third partys that includes us. We then use this info to help track you down if you flee an accident. 




 I used to work at Game in the UK. I remember other sales people thinking I was mad for not forcing a pre-order on this nervous little 9 year old kid who clearly didn't want it. I guess I just don't have the killer instinct needed for sales.

 It just occurred to me that the "v" gesture changed from a war-related symbol to the complete opposite! Any insight would be much appreciated. 




 Although I'm just a beginner I did read a paragraph on this in a gourmet shaving book today, the author said if a brush is still doing this after 1-2 weeks you should contact the seller. 




 I definitely will, I couldn't believe how generous it was! I want to shave 10 times tonight so I can try it all out! 




 He wrote a note that said "exceptionally cold" as well haha! Your warning has been heeded! 




 I just got given a sample of this but I'm totally new to shaving properly, should I be excited??
