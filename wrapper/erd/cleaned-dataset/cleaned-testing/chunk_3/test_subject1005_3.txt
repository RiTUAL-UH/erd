 Hahaha this is a good example of what I'm looking for though. I actually didn't see either of the newer Spidermans. Rebooting the Batmans made sense to me (because of years passed and newer technology) but Spiderman just seemed way too soon. I heard they were good though.  




 What is your favorite movie, its criticism and your defense for said criticism? 




 Especially their jam session at the end. I agree. 




 Yeah! I loved Whiplash and it definitely made me want to play percussion again.  




 And what do you say about music in movies? Or movies about music? You don't think that can be inspirational? Maybe I wasn't clear in my title. I didn't mean "What action scene inspired you to play the trombone?" lol  




 Are you saying you cannot be inspired by movies?  




 That Thing You Do inspired me to take up drums (for I am Spartacus) when I was a child. I'm a guitarist now, but always credit that movie as getting me started. What're yours? 




 He killed David Palmer too, you know. Fuck that guy.  




 That's what I mean by throw-back. The director was intentionally vague about the timeline. I mean, just the use of cellphones and whatnot, we can deduce it's a modern day movie, but the heavy use of synth music and the old-style movie theater, the cars, the black and white TVs. It was done intentionally to give you wide range of impressions and feelings. I suppose that doesn't work for everyone, but I enjoyed it.  




 I had the same reaction as you OP. But it was a really cool throw back to 70s/80s horror films with a peculiarly interesting new story. I think I appreciated it more than I liked it, if that makes sense.   




 One more thing....does she know her daughter is still alive *cue the trumpets 




 He wasn't a friend to the MC, but he wasn't a villain either. I guess we'd have to establish what we mean by "villain." If you're implying anyone against the MC, then he would qualify. But that's like saying Hank is the villain of Breaking Bad because the main character is Walter White.  




 Why is he being defined as a villain? 




 One of the most overused phrases on this sub, dude.  




 Roger Workman 









 Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for responding.  




 Can you please respond to my question below when you get a moment?  




 Eve was into oranges. Everybody knows that. Duh.  




 Thank you for this. It helped immensely.  




 THANKS EVE, YA JERK! 




 So all who are Christian are elect? 




 Yeah, I feel like there should be a better word than "election" to describe the situation.  




 Wouldn't the Cross be pointless if there was unconditional election? I feel like I'm still fuzzy on the particulars here. I thank you for your response. 




 It all started one day in Eden.... 




 Hi guys! First time poster on this sub. I'm a fairly new believer (little over a year or so) and have a question about this word: Elect. Let me preface my question with saying I don't believe God is ever surprised. Therefore it should come as no shock to Him when someone becomes saved. By this thought, you could say that all who are saved are "elect" because God knew they would come to Christ. But then why make the distinction? Why aren't the "elect" just called Christians? It may just be my misunderstanding of the term, but it stings my ears when I hear people say "elect." Even if I, myself, are "elect," I still hate the title. Can someone please explain to me where my misunderstanding is? It would mean a lot. 




 You're right, it is not. Reddit is full of idiots. FULL of them.  




 House of the Devil better than The Conjuring? Are you fucking high?
