 This past week I went to the new Diagon Alley section of Universal Studios. I was not disappointed. Hogsmeade was amazing, and Diagon Alley only added to that.
Going through the park, you can ride the Hogwarts Express and walk through a brick wall. The only problem is that you don't know you're doing it. Other people can see it, but you just see yourself walking through a door way. After riding both ways, my boyfriend and I hadn't found the wall, so we decided to ask about it. We, not thinking, asked on the Muggle London side. When I asked, the worker gave me a very confused look and informed me that there was Platforms 9 and 10 and if I wanted, I could throw quarters at the wall. She also advised I not walk through a wall because it would hurt. I walked away no closer to the wall, and yet I was completely satisfied.
Later, my family (me representing Gryffindor and my mom and boyfriend representing Slytherin) were approached by a dark looking witch. Conversation is as follows:
Witch (W): "You keep good company, Gryffindor!"
Me: "I don't think so" with a grin.
Witch: "Where is your wand?!"
Me: "It's at home. I forgot it."
Witch: "You better be careful especially in Knockturn Alley. It isn't safe for a Gryffindor witch. Better hope your friends protect you."

It was an amazing experience! Delicious Cottage Pie in the Leaky Caldron. Amazing Deathly Hallows show. Wonderful ice cream! Everyone should consider trying to make a trip, but I suggest staying at a resort to get early entry. Escape from Gringotts was a 5 hour wait by the third ride! 




 I looked at her recent posts, and 4 days ago she posted about feeling like someone is watching her. Then 68 days ago she said she didn't feel safe anymore. That's really scary. 




 With this scam, I assumed the "scientific code" was the number to a prepay card he had already stolen, so when I would type it in, the money would go on to his card and not the one I rang up. Then I would need to cash it out to be activated. 




 It's a good thing that I work nightshift, and only have to see her an hour every shift 




 Sorry about formatting and errors! I'm on mobile! I posted a little while back about my douche manager and did pretty well, so I'm going to do another about the douche daytime supervisor... She's not even my boss

If you missed my first post, I work in a regional grocery store putting up sale signs and hanging price tags on night shift. Of course, my boss was on vacation. Bad things always happen when he leaves. We got a phone call to the store after hours. The person claimed to be the store manager and asked to speak to someone who could run a register. I was the only one there who could, so I go to the phone. He tells me that he's my boss (not the store manager). So, I'm already suspicious, but since they're both named Michael, I thought maybe the man that answered the phone misheard. He proceeds to tell me to grab a pay as you go money card, put money on it, and he would give me a "scientific code" to put into the register, cash it out, and put it and the receipt on his desk. I tell him that he should know I can't cash out a transaction without the customer being there, but he can call back when the front line boss comes in. He then asks when they'll come in. I already know this is clearly not my boss or the store manager because they would know when the morning shift came in. So I tell him at 6:00 am when the store opens. He yells at me and tells me that he's the store manager and knew when the store opened and that he needed the cards done before 6am. I apologize and continue to tell him I can't do said transaction. He hangs up on me.

When the day shift boss comes in, I tell her about the scam. She yells at me for doing the transaction. My mouth drops at first and I stare at her. When she's done yelling, I tell her I didn't do. She then proceeds to tell me I did a good job but never apologizes for yelling even though I told her at the beginning that I didn't do the transaction. Later, when I check my company email, it turns out another store in the area fell for the scam and lost $10,000.

Did she really think I was that dumb?! 




 Thank you! He was recently promoted to manager, and his head is huge now... He was bad before. He's unbearable now. 




 Please excuse grammar and formatting! I'm on mobile 

I work in a regional grocery store putting up signs and changing price tags. Corporate expects 1089 tags hung in 8 hours. My department manager was on vacation. I'm the only one trained to do my job and his, so I'm doing both of our jobs for only 50 cents more. My company doesn't allow overtime, so I had to ask the store manager to let me leave early because I had 5000 tags to hang in one night. Clearly, I couldn't get it done, so I was gonna go over. When I ask him, he seems confused about why I have so many hours. I inform him that since my boss is on vacation that's I'm working both jobs. He's still confused about why my department gets 40 hours a week. We hang every sale sign and make sure every price is right every day.

Fast forward to later that day, I'm walking around the store making sure all our major sale signs are correct. Up comes the store manager, he asks if I will clean the break room. He didn't seem urgent, and he didn't specify when. I agree assuming he means after I check prices which is more important. Not 5 minutes later, he runs back up to me asking if I cleaned the break room. I reply, "Sorry, Sir. I was going to do it after I checked prices." He proceeds to yell in my face and tell me we have "enough" signs. So I drop what I'm doing to clean the PRIVATE break room.

I'm finally done with the break room and go back to the floor. As I walk past the deli area, I hear douche manager yelling at them for not having a sign up that they had asked me to make, so I walk over, give him my nicest smile, and say "Sir, I was on my way to make that sign when you told me we had enough and that cleaning the break room was more important." He storms away because I didn't do anything to actually get in trouble.

Fast forward not even 20 minutes later, he comes to find me to ask if I'll make a sign for a bread rack. When I go to check prices, I realize they're all different prices, and I don't have room to make a sign for every thing. I tell my manager. He yells in my face again asking why I can't just do my job. I proceed to walk over to the rack and make a sign for the cheapest item on there so if anyone complains about the price of a more expensive item on the rack, they'll get it for the price of the cheapest one. Clearly, my manager hasn't a clue about my job!

Edit: Minor grammar fixes 




 Oh good! Hopefully it'll help! :) 




 My gosh! I can't imagine that. I've heard Alzheimer's is horribly hard to watch. Your stories just make me more worried about my parents getting it. I'm so sorry for you family. I'm not sure what else to say. 




 I'm sorry you went through that! 




 I'm a Psychology major, and one of the theories involved behavior of older people. We learned that older people who are mean and hateful are unhappy and regretful about their life. While happy, nice older people are generally content and satisfied with the life they've lead. I don't know which is sadder mental illness or being so miserable with your life that your mean to people.
