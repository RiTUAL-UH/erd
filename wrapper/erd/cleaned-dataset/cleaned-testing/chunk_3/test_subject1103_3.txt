 Reasonable offer? I'm willing to sell at a fair price.  I got holiday icons too. Since 2014. 




 Did OP buy it?

This account has 10k IP and 729RP points, with full page runes. championship name is "drummergeorge" No bans or anything

I am asking about $100 as I spent around about $50 in skins.  




 Damn, CSUSB was a horrible choice to made, I should have went to UCR. Anyone want to tell me some awesome things UCR has? How are the events on campus? Is the campus alive?  




 KAWWWKKAAAUUUU THE MUDMEN HAVE FOUND US!! 




 Birds are our future  




 The one with the guy telling us he had a concussion due to a football accident and tells us a story how he lived a life until he was 40 had wife, kids, successful job, until one day, he saw a lamp in his house but it wasn't a lamb. It was bent, in a way it would appear to defy all common laws. He stared at it for weeks. His wife was concerned about him, he just stared at it. Until he realized it was fake, the lamp didn't exist. He woke up shortly after in the hospital bed. He had severe depression and couldn't cope anymore. He had lived 40+ years with a woman he loved, and a child he had, he said he sometimes sees the kid in his phericpheral.  




 Can you leave the shit face hole you live in? Honestly if you don't I can realistically see you killing yourself. If not, then I don't know.  




 Depends on your learning style. Personally, I do well in a group. I like to study in a group and loudly too, with music. 




 Play League of Legends, browse Ebay and Amazon, go on Facebook for mindless hours, and reddit.  




 There is a promotion right now on the Misfit Facebook, code is SHINEON25. You get 25% off, which is $74.99 Better to use this if you're buying it, unlike me where I did one of those 20$ off two days ago.. 




 I'm buying one today, I'll add everyone? :) 

edit: Oh, this is a female subbreddit, I just searched, "misfit shine" NEVERMIND  




 Yay drugs!  




 Well.. it's easier to to gain it to lose it. So... 




 If I was the person about to be killed to the self-driving car, then yes. Kill the dumb bitch. But if I was sitting in the self-driving car, then fuck no. Kill the dumb bitch on the road.  




 Also OP if you're a young attractive japanese girl you can always invest on a webcam ;) PM me for more details.  




 You have to have history. I'm 19 and I have two credit cards. I got decided for  a Sale Malie, due to my short credit. I always pay in full, no CC debt, but if you want the best, you have to be the best. (Which means having previous good history)  




 How do you know 848 is the highest and which dude? How do you know?
 




 You can sell your blood and bone marrow.  




 Anyone got surrealism? 




 Leave your antidepressants in your kitchen cabinet. Not on your night stand. Make sure to put your phone away from your bed with the most ugliest annoying noise you can abhor.  




 Who did she pick?  sounds like the intern got chad 




 Yep. after I saw an AMA here I knew it was all over.  You only need 5 posts though.  Read the Top Posts of all time . "cheers" 




 delicious. Did you do a BBQ shortly  after?  




 FUCK ME.  




 Somebody has to do it. It depends on personality and morals really. I can never be a laborer, I'm not willing to fatigue my body for a living, instead I want to heal people mentally and physically. Same for jobs that face violence every day, e.x  police, military excursions. It just depends on the person. Not saying neither of any jobs is bad or great. It's just what you want to do with your life.  




 I respectfully disagree with you, ask any person studying for endless hours in college and they will tell you other wise. It's a sacrifice trying to remember pointless material you'll only use twice- on the midterm and final. People want a certain job. No one wants to work, but that's not how the world works.  




 To be fair, no one wants to do anything of those, except the bottom one. No one wants to pick trash up, but people do.  




 In my experience nothing but time can heal this type of wound. Not everyone can or will recover. Only through therapy I can honestly say he will be better with an external source. Other than that, he might become an addict of some sort to relieve the pain. Sorry for your loss.  




 This sounds like a mid life crisis. Life isn't meant to be taken seriously.  




 Why is he playing on the wide walk? Inconsiderate  as hole
 




 I totally agree with you, OP. That's why I'm flying to Japan in 3 weeks. Fuck bills, fuck you. Let's fuck some kawaii japanese girls, desune. 




 I made it through the whole thing without laughing. The secret is soul crushing depression. 




 You lack critical analysis to really understand. I feel sorry for you, can now easily manipulate you. 




 CAPS LOCK IS annoying. 




 I did this once. I had my Amigos fake trade me. I ended up with 3 birches that day 




 Trust in your papa.  




 You have to read, *a lot*.  




 Did you see craigslist? Snajjajob? Don't give up, OP!  




 1) You pay the payment on the credit card website. Look at the credit's websites for a "Make payment" button and enter a bank account, whom you will be making the payment from.

2) As far as I know, it's best to use the card each month, so it will be "active" and will show a history of credit. Of course pay in full each month. 

Personal advice: Discover Student is the way to go, I got it when I turned 18. 




 Try using Cricket as your phone provider. It is GSM network (ANnT towers) I pay $35 a month for everything unlimited, including 4gLTE internet, (2.5gs, after it throttles to 4g) (also don't use their cheapy ass, welfare phones) (buy an unlocked phone for GSM and use cricket service) I have a Note 4, and paying the shittest price ever.  




 social media is a terrible habit if you don't use it as a tool to be productive in life e.x right way to use it: message your friends. See group posts about academics or follow major events that give coupons. e.x of bad way to use it. Be on social media for 5+ hours a day doing stupid shit. If you are the latter, then idk what you can do.

 This spot is synonymous with a previous muffle beer drink on reddit, a few months ago. Most likely op became influenced by a bad idea.  still funny though.
