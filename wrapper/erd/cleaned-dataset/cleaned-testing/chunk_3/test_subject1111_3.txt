 Freeloader. 




 Brit here who works in France a lot - I never really worry about it, and just switch sides without difficulty. You just get used to it.

That said, I find driving on the right to be more comfortable. No idea why. 




 Read: "I didn't like it as the jokes just flew right by me. NURSE! NURSE!" 




 France loves chips (fries, if you're a Merkin). In Belgium they are more or less the national dish.

Yes, European food tends to be more realistically sized, but chips for every meal does nothing for the waistline!

 Actually, much of Clue isn't actually made up on the spot and this line clearly wasn't, but it's very fair to say that those who think quickest do best and that the funniest bits are the off-script parts.

Look up "Lyttleton's Britain", a collection of Humph's introductions by the man who actually wrote many of them, Iain Pattinson. Hilarious read. 




 Look up "The Letter" from Fry and Laurie. Still one of my favourite pieces of writing. 




 From Uxbridge English Dictionary:

"Countryside - to kill Piers Morgan"

Awesomely broadcast on primetime radio at 6.30pm and it clearly took several minutes to restore order in the theatre. Hats off to both Radio 4 and Stephen Fry. 




 Unquestionably Dumgoyne. Lovely pic :-)

 Indeed. Have a read up...this concept of synchronised start times across multiple channels was introduced by then controller of BBC2, David Attenborough :-) 




 Not sure what age this is, but in the UK, my kids were taught cursive from the first time the drew a letter at age 4. My son religiously writes in cursive letters...I just need him to get them closer together now!

 I think Merkin camping is different from Yourope camping.

These things are quite common over here and, strangely, more robust than they appear. I used to have one and it was great fun. 

Now I have a touring caravan (large by UK standards, about the size of a beer cooler by American standards...) and it has a nice canvas awning that is a pleasure to erect and rock solid when done right.  




 Type "recursion" into Google....  




 Normal in yoo-rope, of course. Oh and no need to worry about health insurance (in the UK anyway). Oh and your employer can't easily fire you on the spot.

Damn, how do you people in the colonies put up with it!? 




 Up, up, up.

Same game, same boat. I bloody hate computers too. 




 I suspect you don't work in IT. Or, in fact, at all... ;-) 




 Couple of notes:

1. This is Renault software (the window title reports "Renault Sport")
2. This is a French language Windows installation. Note that it doesn't say "Start" on the start button ;-)
3. I can also see "voiture en P1" and mostly details related to engine

Conclusion: this is Renault's engine diagnostics more than car stuff.

 




 Sorry about that, world. I'll try better next time. 




 I'm such a rebel! ;-) 




 Honestly, there would be no point. It was nearly 20 years ago and, frankly, I can't even remember what I had for breakfast yesterday! 




 Heh...I was a beta tester for this way back :-)

Ah, memories... 




 Any mirrors? 




 None of this applies on non-CDMA nets, which effectively means "outside of the USA" :-)

OOI, if I buy a new phone, I stick my sim in it and it works. If I want to move networks, I replace the sim and am sorted. Can simless carriers refuse to swap your phone between nets? Can you hack it yourself? 




 Don't think so. All telematics are strictly one way only. 




 I love the response to "did you go flat through Woodcote?" When he replies "yes" there's a lovely quiet whisper of "oh god!" from Horner in the background... 

This was a BBC film from a GP weekend. Superb video to see again, thanks. 




 This is on a tiny island (read: rock in the sea) called Staffa near the Isle of Mull which is itself near the west coast of Scotland.

Staffa is a magical place but Mull and Iona (another small island) are two of my favourite places in the world and are certainly amongst the most beautiful places you can visit.

Mull was recently voted into the top 10 best islands in Europe and considering the competition, this should give and indication of how well people regard it.

(In fact, Scotland appears no less than three times in the list so why are you sat reading this! Get yourself over here and see for yourself!) 




 A trifle extreme for a very minor infraction, methinks.

As requested, have a downvote :-) 




 Nah, they're on their way to becoming little adults. They know when they can challenge us and sometimes, frankly, they're right to do so. I want my kids to be independent and, these days at least, I rarely need to impose my will - they know what's right and wrong.

Exercising this judgement is one of the cool things about parenting.

That said, when needed, my authority is absolute. Rarrr! 




 Tough one, but:

"Bring them up to understand that: a) wrongdoing (even accidental) deserves an apology and b) Your parents' word is law"

I.e. refusing to apologise simply wouldn't happen.

My kids are awesome and generally wouldn't even need prompting in this regard. As a result, they get to do a lot more things with us as there's pretty much nowhere that we wouldn't take them. I love being a parent (most of the time, anyway!) 




 Rock Music Rule #1:
If your guitar solo isn't immediately preceded by "GEEETAR!" then it's not a real guitar solo. 




 True, but if you buy an expensive electrical item that fails in, say, 18 months, wouldn't you have a sensible expectation that the product didn't last a reasonable amount of time?

UK returns law is largely rooted in this concept. If you buy something that costs 10 you have a much lower expectation of longevity than if you bought something for 1000. So if that 1k washing machine fails after 18 months on a 12 month warranty, you'd certainly have a good case against the retailer (not: *not* the manufacturer - you're contract is with the person you bought it from) 




 In the UK, your contract of purchase is with the store you bought it from and it's their responsibility to resolve the issue.

That said, many do back this service off to the manufacturer, which is OK *if* the service is acceptable.... 




 Yes, I've noticed much the same in many (but not all) of the replies on this topic.

Interesting... I wonder how much the somewhat materialistic, US-centric audience affects this?
