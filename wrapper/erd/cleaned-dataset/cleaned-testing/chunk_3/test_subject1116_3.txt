 Got 1.  But the more I think about the more I feel like ill wait a week before deciding on a trade.  This isn't something I need to do. 




 I feel the same way but the other person is adamant in involving Allen.  




 I am currently 8-1 and looking to upgrade at QB and maximize my starting lineup potential for the playoffs. The playoffs are weeks 15-17. The top 2 seeds get a bye, I am the 2nd seed and am facing the top seed this week.
My current roster is as follows:

QB: Alex smith, Mike Glennon, Vick (EJ Manuel is on waivers as well)

RB: Eddie Lacy, Staced God, Spiller, Ellington, CJ Anderson, Johnathan Franklin

WR: Antonio Brown, Keenan Allen, Eric Decker, Mike Brown

TE: Jimmy Graham

DST: Titans K: Hartley

Standard Espn scoring

The trade is as follows: I'm giving up Allen, Ellington, Alex Smith, CJ Anderson and either Antonio Brown or Decker (still unsure on which one, any help with that would also be nice!)

I will receive: Andrew Luck, Dez Bryant, Steve Smith, David Wilson, Robert Woods.

I also have a trade offer of Big Ben for Ellington waiting in the wings if this trade doesn't happen.

So what should I do?

Thanks for anyone who bother reading this. And thank you even more for those who would even bother answering! 




 Hhaha I just responeded to your other comment.  And I complete forgot about the trade thread. Ill just move this over there then. 




 Fair points.  I do feel like I should wait a week or 2 before deciding on making such a drastic move. EJ manuel is also a FA so I may drop someone for him.  I ended up making another thread to hopefully get some more input on this.  But again thanks! 




 Also thanks for the help 




 I could do an Ellington for Big Ben trade. But I think I would still prefer the starting lineup that the previous trade would produce.  I'm in no rush to make a trade.  It's just that I feel the need to maximize my starting lineup.  Having Decker, Spiller, or Elington on my bench seems like a waste.  And also most other teams seem hesitant to let go of their QB1. 




 I'm pulling off a big trade in a 16 team league.  I'm 8-1 and looking to get and upgrade at QB and maximize my starting lineup for the playoffs.  

I have Glennon, Vick and alex smith at QB.  RBs are Stacey, Lacy, Spiller, ellington, cj anderson and johnathan franklin.  WRs are Brown, Decker, and Keenan Allen. TE is graham.

 I'll be packaging Allen, Ellington, Alex smith, cj anderson, and either Decker or Brown for Andrew luck, Dez Bryant, Steve Smith, David Wilson and Robert woods.  So I'm stuck deciding who I would rather have for the rest of the year, Brown or Decker 




 I'm leaning towards Brown at the moment.  He gets more targets plus I feel like the Denver Broncos will slow down. 




 It depends on the severity of the break.  I do remember Ryan matthews needing 4-6 weeks to recover from it last year.  Either way there is no definitive timetable atm.  That will come later on in the week with more tests scheduled for Rodgers, according to a radio interview he just did.  Here's a link by from Bill Barnwell's twitter: http://www.texnews.com/1998/cowboys/ftwaik0914.html Aikman needed 6 weeks to come back.  But again there still isnt enough info and at this point there is just alot of speculation.  

I was tempted to buy low on him earlier on but after hearing the interview I've grown hesitant.  Might just have to settle for Big Ben in a trade. 




 Why would it be vetoed? I'm not colluding, I'm attempting to buy low on a player who looks to be out for 3 weeks. 




 Yes you should 




 Im 8-1, in a 16 team league and setting up for the playoff.  I'm looking to trade for a qb and was targeting Rodgers.  What would a fair offer be? I'm willing to trade Eric Decker, Spiller and Ellington.  Would 2 of the 3 be fine? Also the other team is 3-6 and only has reggie bush as a viable player. 




 This is the list of ROS ranking for RBs coming into Sunday from FantastPros: http://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/ros-rb.php 

The only RBs I'd rather have (in no particular order) would be AD, charles, McCoy, Lynch, Forte, Bush, Morris, Lacy, Gore, Moreno.  So I would have him at 11.  What do you guys think? 




 I havae both in a 16 team league and prefer Stacy mainly beacaue we know what his role is and will be going forward. Who knows what Arians plans to do with Ellington.  Also the Rams oline looked fantastic against seahawks front 7.  Meanwhile a week before the Cardinals oline looked absolutely awful against the same seahawks front 7.
