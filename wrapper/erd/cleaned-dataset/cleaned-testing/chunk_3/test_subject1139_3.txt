 Three point shooting is horrendous for both teams but the Nets are actually getting good looks. 




 Classic Mushishi bitter-sweetness.

I love the metaphorical use of the cold and snow to express Toki's feeling of numbness after losing his sister. Then use Tae's warmth to express the feeling of caring and comfort that helped Toki to move on. Very simple but well executed. 




  believe-in-yourself motivational nonsense

Sure it's overplayed in the sports genre (across all mediums) but I wouldn't call it nonsene. Top athletes don't reach the highest level of their craft without self-confidence, self-motivation and being pushed by someone. 




 In terms of romance:

Cross Game

Nana

Honey and Clover 




 Chaika could be another case of the lesser hyped Bones' show being the better one. Too bad it doesn't have the Noragami production values. 




 Sigh. No English subs. I was hoping to add this to my Spring schedule. Oh well, I'll just watch the movie series whenever it comes up in my backlog. 




 Shedding manly tears has been passed down the Armstrong line for generations. 




 Oh boy, I started welling up when I read the "God please..." line. The notion that's she's begging in her diary to remember all these memories was just so sad. 




 This show has an AMAZING soundtrack. 




 The way this show presents different story elements is so disjointed. There's just too much stuff going and the show is not doing much in a way of making sense of them. It was kind of forgivable after the 1st episode but after the 2nd one it becomes worrisome.

I hope there's some sort of pay-off here that would justify the chaotic storytelling.

 




 Mushishi is so good at building human relationships and drama in just 20 minutes. 




 I hope this convinces Sunrise to make another season of Gintama. 




 Better hops than VC but VC throws it down with more authority. 




 Holy crap that episode must have been expensive. The animation, background and character detail, and the lighting/shadowing were all on point. The slow-mo stuff also looked smooth and that means more frames of animation which of course is expensive.

That flashback was really really well done. Great editing and timely use of good music. That might be one of the best implementation of flashbacks I've seen in anime. 




 I think he's like a more evil version of Takamura. 




 That gave me bit of Kiki's Delivery Service vibe. A magical country girl unfamiliar with the city environment. 




 Too much going on for a first episode and a bit overwhelming.

Laying out a bunch of story elements in the first episode is a neat idea though. 




 That hand to hand combat looked good. Nice choreography. 




 Brewers have a really nice ballpark and a very fan friendly atmosphere and amenities. Also people like to go out in the Spring/Summer and baseball can be seen as a leisurely outdoor pastime. Keeping those in mind, with the right marketing you can get people to show up at the ballpark for a mediocre team. 




 Well, that was quick. 




 A relaxing episode about sake. A nice way to reintroduce the show before delving into the bitter-sweet stories.

I also liked how this episode adds to the mushi mythos. 




 /r/anime has been doing seasonal polls since Fall 2012, I think. Here's the [Fall 2013 Poll.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1uxekm/ranime_aoty_2013_aots_fall_2013_poll_results/)

Or you can use [ANN's custom search](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/search/genre). Just type in the start date and end date for the season then it will give you the results in ranking order based on user ratings.
 




 JJ is hitting his peak at the right time. I hope he keeps it up going into the playoffs.

*waits for Hawks fans to mock me* 




 Sounds like Bargs. 




 Should have kept the scarf. 




 She's a Nudist [](/s "in her titan form.") 




 Not enough material for another season. Mangaka is too busy drawing fanarts. 




 I saw it coming but still...Ichihime! Noooo! 




 Read the first post of that thread. Or you can read the article I posted.

Japanese animation sales rose 6.5% to 78.99 billion yen (about US$768.4 million) in 2013 to its highest total in six years. Sales of foreign animation for the general public and children were 6.191 billion yen (US$60.2 million), and foreign and domestic animation sales combined were 85.17 billion yen (US$828.5 million). 




  Hahahaha, nice joke. Wait, you weren't joking? http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/215aip/anime_business_industry_data_2013/

That's only for movies.

 









 That fight gave me the chills. Amazing arc from the beginning to the end. 




 [Chihaya Ayase](http://25.media.tumblr.com/ebb21b7d496248fa5678ffb5e5d867b9/tumblr_mh9ws5uy8x1r4xneto4_500.gif) from Chihayafuru 




 Spring and Summer seasons always get the good stuff. 




 What a scare. Should've tried harder to deny Monta from getting the ball. 




 Livingston got away with a lot of grabbing and pulling there. 




 Damn Caesar is OP. 




 The manga sales are excellent so the Japanese do like this type of story. It's just not the type of series that garners fandom and get people to buy blurays and merchandise.

Also this is late night anime so ratings don't matter.  









 I was half expecting to see the Gintama spoof of who wants to be a millionaire. 




 And it's mostly fairly well known animes. These lists would be more interesting if they're recommending niche shows like Otana Joshi, Flag, Beast Player Erin and etc. 




 This arc has been amazing.

Ippo and Silver Spoon have been providing some quality writing and character drama for the past few weeks. 




 Personally I found Courtesan of a Nation to be the best arc. 




 I love how you left out the fact that prior to the takedown Hendricks was landing consecutive punches and kicks on a gassed out and hurt Lawler. 




 The intro to the this episode was great. A prime example of how this show can seamlessly transition from serious moments to comedic ones.

The writing, pacing and character progression have been superb. The dialogue and the way characters react are believable and genuinely heartfelt. This is one of the few shows that handle emotional moments in a natural and sincere way, right along with shows like Mushishi, Cross Game, Natsume and a few others. 









 All of a sudden this show turns into a psychological thriller. I think the second half has handled the transition between tonal shifts a lot better than the first half. 









 This felt good after the way the Nets lost to Raps in the last game. 




 Blatche with some horrendous defense. 




 Lowry is really pushing his luck with the refs. Surprisingly they have been patient with him. 




 Ugh, I was really hoping it wouldn't do the "beat some sense into him" cliche. That was just bad writing because Ignacio barely exists as a character and all of a sudden he's playing a significant role in the MC's life this late in the season. It also robbed us of a possible good interaction between Kal and Ariel since it really should've been Ariel talking some sense into him. Really, the best thing this anime has going for it is the relationship between Ariel and Kal, and in a very important moment it decided to go away from it.

Pretty disappointed with this show since I really, really liked The Princess and the Pilot. 




 I find myself sometimes saying "Oy, Oy, Oy" like Gintoki does. 




 Nobunaga you spectacular bastard. I love the over the top confidence, the hubris and the grandiose. It's such a nice change of pace from other MCs.  




 This episode made me want a serious period drama anime. 




 Nets broadcast team can be hilarious at times. 

I want to see how an Ian Eagle and JVG duo would work out. 




 But damn, you can't just end it in the middle of a **well deserved ass whoopin.**

I dunno about that, the guy just found out the girl he loves is partly responsible for his parents' death. His emotional response is completely understandable. If this goes the "beat some sense into him" route then it would be some pretty bad writing.  




 [Anime equivalent of Jurassic Bark](http://vimeo.com/38013872). 




 Best battle so far in terms of animation. Plus Caesar got his comeuppance. 




 Aww at the group hug in the end.


We're the Three Best Friends

That Anyone Could Have 

We're the Three Best Friends

That Anyone Could Have 









 Haha perfect ending with the old man smacking everyone with his cane. 




 Shiroe: The Playa in Glasses 




 AMEN! 




 Nodame delves into music and a musician's life a lot more than Sakamichi no Apollon. 




 Oh man, I love Nodame. Great Romcom. 




 I love that little bit of introspection by Hachiken about running away might have been a good thing but it doesn't mean the problem just disappears.

Also for anyone who enjoyed the baseball part, I recommend that you go watch **Cross Game!** 




 This might be my favorite fight in the series. I really like how it emotionally escalates right along with the intensity of the fight. 














 This show is making me realize how uncreative I was during my toy playing days. 









 Even though Yukine is being a little brat, I still feel bad for him. It doesn't exactly help that Yato is as personable and empathetic as a cardboard box, and is not being a good friend/parental figure to Yukine.

After a few episodes that made me want to smack Yukine, this episode actually made me sympathize or at the very least empathize with him. Also you're right about Yato, despite his good intentions of wanting to reform Yukine and not give up on him, he really hasn't handled the situation gracefully. 




 Yukine seems to have some abandonment issues. Nora showing up and making Yukine think Yato could leave him for her seems to be the catalyst to this whole mess.

Yato knows this and doesn't want to give up on him maybe for atonement, or maybe out of compassion. 




 I like Eagle. I found myself rooting for him.

That cliff hanger though. 




 He should hire a PR person. 




 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 and Garden of Words. Both are excellent. 




 Space Battleship Yamato 2199. It's an excellent space opera not just for an anime but across other mediums. Also, IMO the far and away best anime in 2013.

Go watch it! 




 Those are too long to be considered pixie.

Pixie is more like [this](http://i.imgur.com/nSX0FIm.jpg?1). 




 I'm a fan of bob cuts too.

 Damn, shit just got real serious all of a sudden. I approached this as a "turn my brain off and just enjoy" anime but this episode is making me think otherwise. 




 Robot Family is hilarious, best episode so far. 




 That was kind of a lame fight, no tension whatsoever. I understand it's a set up episode but a whole episode about a dominant win is boring. 




 That Mari and Mizuki argument is really well written and acted. The dialogue genuinely expressed anger and frustration...then we see Moe wearing a paper bag and then yuri. Haha, only this show can troll you like that. 









 The goofiness of this episode reminded a bit of Gintama, especially the [manboarding bit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAqo1mNq15A). I didn't mind it at all and thought it was amusing until the exposition dump, which came off as forced and felt like last minute story telling. 




 There's been too many flashbacks, the show might have just as well started from the very beginning then just do a time skip. I think the pacing would've been better that way but obviously that would eliminate the twist.

Those aerial scenes looked good, pretty obvious that's where a lot of the budget is going. 




 Caesar is a big believer in ~~love~~ kidnap at first sight. 




 I've read that the American companies were overpaying for licenses with total disregard for quality but hearing some of those titles really put things in perspective on how crazy the bubble got. 




 Eleki Battery is so not a common Filipino name lol. 




 I wonder if the BD is going to have a less censored version of the bath scene just like Monogatari did...you know for science. 




 The Japanese aren't big time purchasers of DVD/BDs so it makes sense to maximize price in a limited market.


This [ANN article](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-07) explains it better:

The High Prices... Explained!

To a Westerner, the Japanese DVD market seems horribly overpriced. With the average disc running over 7,000 (US$92) and only containing 2-4 episodes of a series, the cost of collecting a single show can easily run several hundred dollars -- more than many American fans spend in a single year. 

The prices actually stem from a business practice we used to have in America, too: rental pricing. Basically, back in the dawn of the home video business, the industry was constructed in a way where "niche" releases were only meant to sell a few thousand copies, mostly to video rental shops. Prices were high (typically $89.95 in America), but video shops benefited from having a wide and semi-exclusive selection of movies that normal people would never pay for. At those prices, only a few thousand sales could mean over a million dollars of revenue. Initially, video industry people didn't think there was much of a market in selling to collectors. 

But the fans proved them wrong. Otaku of all kinds (not just anime fans) started buying the videotapes and laserdiscs, and they bought them at those high prices that were intended just for video stores. There was no reason to lower it. **In fact, there were a few experiments to drop the price to a more affordable amount, but that usually resulted in a slight increase in sales -- not enough to make up for the drop in revenue.**

When you think about it, that makes sense. Most Japanese people live in much smaller homes, and with many more people than their Western counterparts. In most cases, it simply doesn't make sense for Japanese consumers to build a big home media library. Only the hardcore fans of a particular product will usually want to bother owning a tape or DVD, and everyone else relies on rental shops. Media is a specialty market, not a mass-market one, so prices have stayed astronomically high. 

The Japanese Otaku's desire to own anime even at high prices had an unexpected effect: as the rest of the economy tanked and video stores stopped buying every new video release, the otaku kept buying pretty much everything that got released. Before long, the few thousand fans that bought anime DVDs were supporting nearly the entire budget of a show. Even as the rest of the Japanese home video industry lowered their prices to varying degrees, anime stayed at the same high price. It's simply the only way most shows can ever make a profit. 




 Mr. Justice is a spammer.

This show is INSANE, INSANE, INSANE. The whole From Beyond thing being an elaborate hoax doesn't really explain the PM going all super saiyan. 




 [](/s "I could never bring myself to say it but...Yuichi, I've always...loved you.")

[](/s "***smashes snow bunny***") 









 I feel the same. 




 I'm gonna be avoiding Sportcenter tonight, don't wanna see that ending again.

I wanted this win bad not just for the standings but for more momentum heading into the games against OKC and Indiana. 




 Fuck. Fuck. That fucking hurt. Fuck. 




 I wonder how much change the Wind Revolution brought. The class divide still seems to be prevalent and the end result was a transfer of power from one blue blood to another. 









 All of a sudden romcom love triangle. The absurdity is pretty entertaining. 




 Dat David Eagle ass. 




 I know how Ookawa-senpai feels. 




 It's from the 2nd movie. 









 Grown up Kagura made a comeback in the latest movie but [](/s "with smaller boobs.") 









 This was in the front page of /r/pics a couple of weeks ago.

I love the fact that love hotel is real.

 Eh? Nothing that has transpired so far made me think that she should die and that's the only way to end things. There's still so many unanswered questions about her role. 

Killing off a characters can be cliche also and if not done properly can be seen as a cheap attempt for a tear jerker. 









 The enemy has some faulty designed mechas lol.

Betrothed to his sister and now to a loli. Also with a cross dressing love interest on the side. Nobunaga is like Araragi with a mecha. 




 That's a fabulous pose. 














 The underwear song is pretty catchy. That Satan skit is pretty amusing, it got me with the "please deliver me from paper" line.  




 Damn, just reading this speculation hit right in the feels. 




 This show with its roller coaster ride of tonal shifts is playing with my emotions. 









 The bomber being linked to the teacher/bullying felt tacked on. This episode didn't do as good of a job as the first episode in terms of intertwining different cases together. 




 Usagi Drop, Honey Clover and Cross Game are all on Hulu. 




 [In the OP there's a little girl cuddled up with little Kal-el.](http://i.imgur.com/AOmivlF.jpg) Hmmm, I wonder if that's Claire. If that's true and she's also Nina Viento then this might get interesting.  




 I hope it avoids the imouto route but I guess it fits in with the insanity. Maybe the term "sister" means something else lol.

 The best they can do is being done already and that is being available on Crunchy, Hulu, Netflix and having some shows in toonami. Late night anime used to be available on cable TV like Sci-fi Channel and Tech-TV/G4 but those channels are niche. Even in those niche channels anime couldn't draw a decent enough audience to be kept on air.

The only anime that hit mainstream are children's shows like Pokemon, Digimon, DBZ and etc. That's back when children's shows in general were popular, when Kid's WB, Fox Kids and afternoon Toonami existed. Those days are long gone.

Non-sitcom animation for adults in general has always been niche. Archer is on a relevant cable network and in its four seasons has never reached 2 million viewers. If an American made animation of that type can't hit mainstream then anime doesn't have much of a chance



  




 Late night anime has always been niche. Obviously there has been a few exceptions like Eva, AoT, Haruhi, Madoka and a few others but for the most part the audience will always be limited due to the time slot. 




 Ononoki with that posed look. 




 Yeah, the slice of life stuff is a nice breather or palette cleanser in between the intense fights. 




 That's adorable. I'd watch a show about a girl and her pet alpaca.

This makes me wanna rewatch [Bunny Drop](http://www.hulu.com/bunny-drop). 




 While watching GITS: SAC:

"This is a really complex and intelligent show but what does the Major have against wearing pants?"

 I enjoy the roller coaster ride but some of the transitionary episodes in between the tonal changes are a bit unexciting. 




 The humor is kind of dull but I see some potential due to the unique premise. Some comedy shows take some time to pick up steam like Gintama which took me about 3-5 episodes to really get into.

I'll give this the 3 episode treatment and if it improves I might keep watching. 




 Did the show just referenced Cross Game, because I think it did and it put a smile on my face.

Also [TIL](http://i.imgur.com/SKblCJE.jpg) about cow bra.

 I like how the three jobs merged into one, I thought that was clever. The characters have a good dynamic between them which produced some really funny moments. Then of course, there's also the action and the music. Best premiere so far this season, looks like it's going to be a fun show. 




 Since you liked this one, here's a few suggestions from the same genre:

Wolf Children (movie)

[Hotarubi no Mori e](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grTUkLgHwGM) (movie)

Cross Game (series) - sports anime but the drama is excellent



 




 Watch The Princess and the Pilot, this series is a spin-off of that movie. It has the romance in the sky vibe that's a bit reminiscent of Laputa: Castle in the Sky. 




 The anime is [Anohana](http://www.hulu.com/anohana-the-flower-we-saw-that-day). The location is Chichibu. 




 man that romance was a little rushed with that "grab her as she falls ,stare into each others eyes and embrance" scene.

Yeah, that escalated way too quickly and came off kind of cheesey. A nice dialogue where they share a few laughs would have suffice in establishing the romance.

 









 Those CG mechs didn't look so good. The show's world building seems fairly interesting though. 




 I guess that was alright. The animation was great towards the end but the humor fell flat with the exception of the circle joke. 




 Kino's Journey season 2, please. 




 I was so happy when I noticed it's a double episode. The show sold Sawamura's bait pretty well.
