I'm looking for a durable but comfortable style. If you like your boots par tell me what they are. Thanks so much fellas 




 Hey Nathan I am a huge fan and I've seen every episode. 

I just want to ask about the girl Rachel. Is that actually how she is or do you exaggerate the awkwardness for the camera? Also when you get her for more than one segment (The Hunk and Quiznos) doesn't she start to ham it up a little too?
