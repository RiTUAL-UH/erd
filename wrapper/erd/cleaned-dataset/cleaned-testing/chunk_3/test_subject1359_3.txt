 Thank god I'm not THAT ugly.
I've never been skydiving but I have zoomed in on google maps really fast. 




 5" x 7" mirror delivered   installed was $400

edit: 5' x 7' thank you jasondickson 




 I had one installed for a surprise for Valentines Day in my bedroom.
Had fun and enjoyed the novelty of it that night with the girl I'm dating after a couple bottles of wine.
I didn't have to work in the morning but she did so she left late that night.
As I awoke the next morning, a bit hungover, with the sun beaming through the window and almost had a heart attack when I opened my eyes cause I thought a naked guy was falling on me. 




 Do you get you bottom licked much?
My girlfriend wants to butt should I letter?
Please post a reply.
