 Forget fallible, a person can remember exactly what he said but lie and say he didn't say it. If it's in writing, someone's going to make a much bigger effort in order to prove that they didn't write it or agree to it. 




 emergence 

I assume you mean emergen-c, which is just Vitamin C, which has absolutely no effect on cold or flu. Nor does it keep you healthy, assuming you get adequate Vitamin C from your food. 

Tell your wife you should stop wasting your money on it.

endemic 

Epidemic. 




 This seems more appropriate to ask in /r/askhistorians.

 Wikipedia:

Evidence of dedications is provided back into the Classical antiquity. Besides the wish to express their gratitude towards a certain person, the authors often had also other reasons to dedicate their work to a particular person. Well into the 18th century, it was not usual for publishers to remunerate the authors; authors tended to be paid or remunerated as one element of a patron-client relationship, in which the author-client paid tribute, in the dedication, to his or her patron. A typical writer dedicated their book to a high standing personality -- to Frsts or bishops -- or to a city and tried to gain some money through this practice.[2]

In many cases the petitioner was lucky and received a gift from the patron. In some cases, the writer groveled before the patron and a formal dedication "contained often a very elaborate and submissive affection".[2] In some cases not only the authors tried to get some money, but also the printers tried through dedications to cover a part of their costs.

The dedication is not to be confounded with the handwritten dedication of a single copy: the presentation copy.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedication_%28publishing%29#History

I don't think it's essential at all. There are plenty of books that don't have dedications these days. If anything, I'd say author thank-you's have become longer and more popular, where it seems like the author thanks pretty much every person they've ever met.  




 Definitely. After reading Mr. Mercedes I came away with the impression that King has never actually encountered a black person outside of his imagination. 




  This just can't be confirmation bias

Of course it can. A sample size of three people that you know proves nothing.

My mother has so far lost probably 100 pounds and she's pretty much exactly the same as she ever was. 




 Also because Robin Williams committed suicide. If he hadn't, there definitely would have been less hysteria.

(TIL that Robin Williams's middle name was McLaurin.) 




 I read reviews and I definitely let negative ones put me off books. If I didn't, my to-read list would be 1,000 books long. As it is, there are still books on my list from as far back as 2009 that I still haven't read. You have to find some way to winnow things down. 




 I don't see any problem here; I do this all the time. The first book is usually the best one, so why bother reading any further?  




 Where did you hear about this? Googling it turns up nothing. 




 And this is why I don't consider listening to an audio book as "reading." You're not reading, you're listening to a performance. 




 I thought it was terrific but you have to have a certain frame of mind to enjoy it. If you're subscribed to /r/atheism, it's probably not for you. 




 Even though I've read a bunch of her books, I haven't actually liked any of them. They're basically all the same so if you didn't like one, you won't like the others. I never got the impression she was anything like Murakami or that she was trying to be like him. 




 This is what the Save button is for.  




 Assuming you're a man: When was the last time you shaved or waxed your chest hair?  




 Ask her who she's coloring her hair for: herself or for you. If she's coloring it for you, tell her you don't need her to do that and bam, $120 in savings. If she's coloring it for you and you do want her to keep doing it, maybe you are on the hook for paying for it. If she's coloring it for herself, then she definitely needs to pay for it herself.

As for the system, it sounds flawed because your girlfriend doesn't sound like she really wants it to be this way. Sooner or later she's going to try to rope you into to paying for something of "hers" again and you're going to resent it and she's going to resent it when you say no. You need to nail this down. And if she's not totally on board with it, you need to chuck it and come up with another system you can both live with. 




  My favourite is when the pull the "Well, you're not a parent..." card whenever any conversation about children and behaviour comes up...

If they say, "You're not a parent, so you don't know how hard it is," you can say, "I do know how hard it is. That's why I'm not a parent -- so I don't end up like you. I can't help it if you didn't know how hard it was before you made the decision to have kids." 




 I'm really surprised there are that many Jews in Seattle that they bother giving off. 




 I feel even worse since that's two mistakes in one. A misspelling and a hypercorrection 




 Can I expect it to be as gripping as Mr. Martins series?

No you can't. Turn back now. 




 At first I thought it sounded really interesting but then I read some reviews that said it was very poorly written, so I decided not to bother. 




 I'm not a student and I read about the same amount. It's about making time for reading. It's also about prioritizing reading. Instead of going on the Internet or watching a movie, read a book. Read during your commute and during your lunch hour.  




 You actually did something interesting, unlike OP who did next to no analysis. Most of these graphs are largely uninteresting and unhelpful.

I once did a study of the books that I read and found that they fell into three categories: Books of authors I'd read before, books that I added to my to-read list based on information I'd read in magazines or the Internet, and books that I took from the shelf of the library without knowing anything about them in advance. 

I found that I tended to like them in just that order, which lead me to taking books off the shelf much less often since it's much less likely that I'll actually end up liking them. Admittedly it means I might miss something great, but I'm willing to risk it considering my to-read list is around 300 books long. 




 As others have said, you just had a baby, give yourself a break especially since we're talking about a short amount of time.

But unlike what others have said, too much TV in and of itself is definitely a bad thing. There are a lot more insidiously negative messages than you might realize, it tends to lead kids to prefer passive entertainment, and if they're watching regular TV, they're being exposed to countless commercials telling them to consume, consume, consume. 




 I've seen 8 of these and only liked 2. Anime tends to be have slow pacing and in a longer format of a movie, they often bore me. That's why I generally prefer anime shows. And even then I've given up on some because they were just too dull.

I liked Read or Die. It wasn't the best ever, but it had an interesting premise that you don't see very often. If you haven't seen it, OP, check it out.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_or_Die_%28OVA%29 




 There is nothing great about "anime" any more than there's anything great about "movies" or "television" or "books" or "music." They're animated movies and TV shows and they have just as much variety as any other art form. 

What can be cool, though, is that for Americans, Japanese culture, mythology, and sensibilities are foreign and often seem odd, so that can be particularly interesting. 




 Kite was soul-destroying. Not recommended. 




 It's a religion and an ethnicity, but not a race since Jews can be of any race. 




 The current list has been extended to 2016 so they won't give the test again until after that. 




 I think you need to say exactly what you're thinking and not mince words in an effort to spare his feelings.

"Honey, I love you, but these days you're feeling more like a roommate than a boyfriend. I have sexual needs and it's upsetting that you don't reciprocate. But please, be completely honest with me and tell me your feelings on this subject and let's see how we can work this out together."

If he squirms and won't give up an answer, you need to press him. If he still won't answer, then if you're still interested in the relationship, make an appointment for couples counseling. If he won't go, then you either have to accept him for the way he is or break up with him.  




 I could see a great animated movie made based on this premise.  




 This really makes no sense. What sort of "lifestyle change" involves something that makes you a "quitter" if you stop doing it aside from smoking (which isn't a bad thing)?

And it's just generally terrible advice. The longer you live a lie, the harder it is to correct it without making yourself look bad.

 This is not an ELI5 question. 




 Except that Tacitus was born 20 years after Jesus died, so regardless of his motivation, he had no first-hand knowledge of Jesus' existence. While Democritus is referenced by people who were alive at the same time, who actually knew him and his extensive body of work. Jesus didn't leave behind any writings. 




 I don't think it does, it's just our perception. In other words, you face only changes minimally from year to year but the increments eventually build up to where they're finally noticeable.  




 It's basically a lazy technique to make a movie longer when they don't have enough plot or a good enough idea for a related subplot. But if it's done well, it can be helpful for developing a character by showing other aspects of their personality that aren't revealed in the main plot. 




 Imagine an avalanche. Can you tell the snow that it's stepping on you? If you yell for help, will the snow help you? Of course not. And a stampede is the exact same way. This mass of people is now behaving more like a mass of inanimate objects than they're acting like a group of individual human beings.  




 You don't. You usually feel worst at night because that's when your fever rises.  









 This is so true. On a recent ELI5 a completely wrong answer got like 10 upvotes because nobody around here has heard the real truth about it.

And the Reddit circle jerk loves certain "facts" that have been debunked or at least severely criticized, such as polyphasic sleep. They keep repeating information about it like it's a solid fact and it ain't.

ETA: Downvotes! Thank you all for proving my point. 




 Actually, they just planted a bunch in my parents' neighborhood in Brooklyn.

 It's generally supposed to go by your father's side but there are all kinds of exceptions to the rule, particularly if you were brought up with your mother's customs.  




 WTF. How on earth does something like this happen? 




 Heh. And ouch.  




 The best mother that I know went back to work six weeks after giving birth. She's great, her kids are turning out great. 

I don't know any good mothers who stayed home.  




 you might end up skipping one that you could have really liked and never know. Pretty much just chance and risks.

There are so many books in the world -- you have to make choices somehow.  




 I bolded my main point. In the end, it's not really about WoT but the fact that I'm tired of reading (or watching) a series and then not have it pay off in the end. 




 Just regarding the writing, Brandon Sanderson didn't have a good handle on the language of WoT. I felt like he used a lot of anachronisms.

As for the story: There were major character deaths that barely merited more than one sentence. 

There was a 900-page battle with this group of people that barely had a single mention in the past 13 books and really had nothing to do with anything. Why was book a 900-page battle? How about a story? With a plot?

And worst of all, Rand's final win against the Dark One had really no impact whatsoever. I read it like three times and I was like, that's it? The same with the breaking of the seals. It was the opposite of epic.  




 What other methods are there? Storyboarding? It would just take too long and be too difficult to storyboard all movies and TV shows. It also wouldn't allow for flexibility; you hear about so many movies being re-written as they're being shot so that would be a problem. 




 1. So that nothing falls in by accident.

2. So that when you flush, the misted water doesn't spray all over your bathroom. 




 Even though studies seem to show that sugar does not make kids hyperactive, most parents will swear that it does. It's not specifically soda, but anything with a lot of sugar in it. 




 That was a really bad last book. Not as bad as the finale of Lost or the last book of Harry Potter or the last few books of the Dark Tower, but definitely one of the worst endings that I've encountered. Lots of other series that I've heard ended badly I've avoided, and this is why even though I read and liked a Game of Thrones, I'm not reading any more books until I find out that the series ends well. **I will not be suckered by a fantasy series ever again.**

The one thing that WoT has left me with is mild PTSD. Every time I see the word "shifted" in any context, I flinch a little.

ETA: Maybe some spoilers below, but trying to avoid it because I don't know how to use the spoiler tag properly. 




 Huh and now it's back? It seems to depend on what computer I'm using?

I just e-mailed them to complain.

 How exactly do they find the statistic of false rape reports?

Here's a Wiki article that talks about various methods: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape

The problem here is that you insist on calling someone who was either proven innocent, or where the case was dropped due to insufficient evidence, a rapist.

Well, as I said before, rape is a difficult crime to prosecute in many cases and it is very rare for a person is shown to be factually innocent, so it is safe to say that the vast majority of cases where a man or woman claims to have been raped, it is most likely to be factually true.

As more and more people are educated about the availability of rape kits and dna tests

Except the problem is that more and more rapists are using condoms in order to avoid DNA tests.

Honestly, I don't know what can be done about all this. I don't like anything people are saying these days about rape prevention. None of it seems remotely helpful. But I'll be damned if I can think of anything better. 




 You can give them your last name as their middle name. All of them. So if your name is Jane Doe you can name your kids Eleanor D. Smith and Robert D. Smith, the D standing for Doe. It is absolutely traditional to do this. Just look at JFK and RFK. Their mother's maiden name was Rose Fitzgerald; their middle name was Fitzgerald. 




 You can use his last name in social situations without formally changing your last name, if you'd both agree with that as a compromise. This way you can get Mr.   Mrs. Smith invitations but still have Jane Doe on your credit card or passport or work ID or whatever and nobody in your social circle has to know. 




 I think you're being overly sensitive or even paranoid. Your own description of your relationship sounds very nice, so the next time someone compliments it, say, "Thank you, you're right, I'm a lucky woman," and that should be the end of that. There's not much for someone to say after you've agreed with them. 




 It's horrible. Half the features aren't there anymore. Is this just the mobile site? Is there any way of getting back to the old version? 




 I was looking at the bag and wondering how you knew she was carrying baby heads in there.  




 They're stupid? They're masochists?

I don't know, when I smell something bad, I do everything I can to try to not smell it anymore. 




 I don't know why you think this. Zero population growth is usually a disaster for the economy because an economy needs to grow in order to be strong. A stable population means the economy wouldn't be growing, it would be stagnating or even shrinking. 




 It's because society teaches men to have large but fragile egos, and their self-worth largely rests on their ability to get a good job and provide for their families. So when their spouse is richer/smarter/more successful than them it's a blow to their ego and their self-worth. 




 Maybe bin Laden wasn't the best example, but he's what popped into my head. My point was that if we really had ninjas like Jason Bourne you'd think there would be a lot more dead bad guys.  




 Is it weird that this made me think of the Thundercats logo? 




 The check-out woman at the grocery store... No thanks. 




 Complete fiction. If it weren't, Osama bin Laden wouldn't have been so hard to find and take down.  




 So, you're telling me that of the 46 that are reported and only 12 are arrested, that the other 34 as well as the 54 that were not reported are definitely rapists?

As I just posted in another thread, the incidence of false rape reports is considered to be from 2-10%. So if you want to say of the 46 reported rapes, 4.6 are false reports, that still leaves 41 reported rapists. And when you include the 56 rapes that aren't reported, which even if you want to reduce that by 10% as well, that's still 3 out of 91 rapists who do jail time. 

Rape is a crime that is very hard to prove and it's not helped by the way rape victims are treated by system. 




 A few things that haven't been mentioned: Kids take their cues from their parents. So in a lot of families, the parents aren't eating healthy, but they try to force their kids to eat healthy. A big thing is to model for your children healthy eating.

Another thing is not to give them unhealthy snacks or meals more than once a week and to reinforce to them that unhealthy foods are a treat that you get on special occasions. I know families that give their kids unhealthy snacks every day or let them have soda with every dinner and then wonder whey their kids don't want to eat their vegetables.

And finally, a lot of parents don't start feeding them normal food when they're very young. But that's when you have to start -- as soon as they are old enough to eat real food. Unfortunately too many parents wait until the kid gets older and by then it's too late -- they're already used to the taste of bland pap.

So to sum: Eat healthy yourself, start the kid young, don't regularly indulge their desire to eat junk.

But if it's already too late and they're already a bad eater, you're basically stuck. There's very little way to undo it short of extravagant bribes, and even that I have found does not work on very picky eaters. 




 "Seem" is the operative word here. False accusations of rape get a lot of attention, especially on Reddit, but in reality, they are rare, with estimates ranging from 2-10% of all accusations. 




 Not a thing here contradicts what I said that 97 of 100 rapists don't go to jail. You seem not to understand that just because someone hasn't been convicted of rape doesn't mean he's not a rapist. 




 the infographic shows that 97% of those convicted never spend a day in jail

No it doesn't. It says that 3 of 5 convicted rapists do jail. What I posted is that 97% of all rapists don't do jail time. That number includes rapists who were not convicted.

The infographic says: of 100 rapes, 54 are not reported. Those rapists don't do jail. Of the 46 that are reported, only 12 rapists are arrested, 9 are prosecuted, 5 are convicted, and 3 do jail. Three of 100 rapists do jail time. 

Your link and edit don't contradict that in any way. 




 You have to be more specific. I'm not looking through four links to try to find what you're referring to. 




 You've never laughed so hard that you've cried? You're missing out. 




 Not me.  




 Microserfs and Jpod, both by Douglas Coupland. They might be a little dated, technology-wise, but they're both excellent. 




 I read 37 of these, though I know that I tried to read some of them and didn't like them, so didn't finish them, so let's round it off to 45. But come on, Stephen King is 30 years older than me. In 30 years I'll have read more books too. 




 Only three out of every 100 rapists will ever spend even a single day in prison, according to a new analysis by RAINN of Justice Department data. The other 97 will walk free, facing no consequences for the violent felony they have committed. 

While the percentage of rapes reported to police has risen in recent years, a majority  54%  still are not reported, according to the Justice Department. But increasing reporting alone won't solve the problem: only about one out of four reported rapes leads to an arrest, and only about one out of four arrests leads to a felony conviction and incarceration.

 No, it never stops until you get really old. You're married, not dead or blind. 

It's funny, my married friend has had more crushes since she got married than she ever did before she got married. At least for her, I think it's a stress thing -- a way of diverting her attention away from problems that can't be helped, like, say, a new bad boss at work.  




 Chewing helps too. Try to swallow something large without chewing it first, you're going to either gag or choke. 




 Huh?

"Which car is yours?"

"The one with the locked doors." 




 According to what I linked, Tokyo's density is 11,300, while Osaka is 13,700. I never heard of Warabi and it's not on the table. 

According to Wikipedia, it is very dense at 14,000, but it has a low population. All the cities on the table are megacities. 

Japan is larger than Italy and nobody thinks of Italy as being a particularly small country. Rome's density is 5,800. 




 Japan and China are large countries and they still have incredibly dense cities. Europe is not dense at all. Though, Mexico City is twice as dense as Tokyo.

 I recently read the Emily Starr books and I could not believe how insane they were. Subversive, even. I would never give them to a kid to read. 

But I agree, Emily starts to get really boring in the last book. Her decision not to go to big city with that woman editor was truly idiotic, and then deciding to marry a man she doesn't love, even worse. 

Ilsa was fun. Maybe there's fanfic about her? 




 At best it's a book packager. At worst it's a self-pub company that's willing to gamble that a few hours worth of superficial editing will net them enough sales to make it worth it. 




 According to Amazon, it's not being published by a real publisher. I don't know why he thinks it is, so he's not going to be any help. 




 Generals used to become president all the time. The last president who was a general was Eisenhower and it makes perfect sense. He was a general during the last "good" war. Who'd elect a president who a general during the Vietnam War? Or the recent Middle Eastern conflicts? Not a sterling record to run on. 




 They aren't. They have their own set of problems. The healthiest thing is to avoid all of them as much as possible. 




 It's normal -- it makes you feel calm and comforted, vaguely like being in the womb. It's why people with various mental conditions may be helped by wearing a pressure vest.  




 Completely disagree. While kippah is more likely to be MO than UO, yarmulke cuts across the board.  




 The Russian Sleep Experiment

That's not a real thing. Nothing about it is true.

http://www.snopes.com/horrors/ghosts/russiansleep.asp 




 Sleep deprivation almost always leads to weight gain for a few reasons. First, it messes with your body's ability to create ghrelin, which helps regulate hunger, second, you have less energy/willpower to resist foods that you know you shouldn't be eating, and third, depending on what sort of sleep deprivation that you have, for example, if you have late-night insomnia, you may find yourself eating more than you normally do because you're awake more. 




 Unlike other comments, I don't think it's meant to sound old, I think it's meant to sound foreign. But instead of hiring actual Greeks with actual Greek accents, they just go for Brits who also have the benefit of having more well-known actors and being native English speakers.

And honestly, I'm starting to see the wisdom in this. I watched the first episode of Marco Polo yesterday and the accents were all over the map because the cast was from all over (America, Australia, Italy, England, etc.). It was a little distracting.  




 It depends what movies you're referring. Seth Rogen movies are funny but they're intentionally not that good. They're just meant to be a silly good time. Or B movies that are meant to be over the top and ridiculous and exploitive. 




 Are the parents still married? In which case, do they want to get a divorce? Because this is how you get a divorce. A married person doesn't sue his spouse if he doesn't get his way. 

It's impossible to say how it would go down. It really depends on a lot of circumstances: there will probably be a psychological evaluation which will have an impact on the ruling, and various state laws will have an influence as well. 




 I watched the first episode on Amazon and I liked it, so I thought I might read the book it's based on, but the reviews really flummoxed me. On Amazon reviewers are split between loving it and hating it and and on Goodreads most reviews are in the "meh" range. I can't remember the last time I couldn't figure out what to expect from a book based on the reviews.

So, has anybody read it? Any thoughts on what made this book so apparently controversial and divisive? 




 I'm about a third of the way through. It's boring. And I loved Treasure Island too, as a kid. 




 They are all flawed. Cuckoo's Calling is the worst of the three. Gone Girl starts strong and ends poorly, while Mr. Mercedes has some weaknesses all the way through but ends pretty well. Pick your poison.  




 Did you see what I quoted? 

But if you don't like that, here are a couple of other sources:

It would appear from Numbers 31:2627 and Deuteronomy 20:1011 that prisoners of war could be, and were, taken into bondage, but it has been contended that no prisoners of war were ever taken into private slavery (Kaufmann, Y., Toledot 1 (1937), 651).

http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/slavery.html

In Kadmoniot Ha-Halakha, Shmuel Rubinstein (Kovno, 5686) writes (chapter 22): The gemara (Kiddushin 25a) teaches: 'There are twenty-four protruding limbs of a person, for all of which a slave is set free, and these are: the tips of the fingers, toes, ears, nose, penis and breasts... Rabbi says: Also testicles. Ben Azzai says: Also the tongue.
The situation of a slave in ancient times was truly awful. He was like an object owned by his master, who was free to do whatever he wanted in order to force the slave to perform hard labor day and night, and to use him for all kinds of perverted purposes. The master could beat his slave mercilessly for any major or minor wrongdoing; he could permanently maim his limbs without fear of any punishment. For any purpose desired by the master, the slave could be blinded. Herodotus writes (4:2) that the Scythians used to blind their captive slaves so that they would work in producing butter. And there were several other such purposes for which slaves would be struck with blindness, TO THE POINT WHERE PUTTING OUT EYES BECAME A SYMBOL OF SLAVERY. Likewise, prisoners taken in war were blinded as a sign of slavery, and this was done particularly to kings and officers of the defeated army, as a sign of revenge and enslavement. For the same reason, Shimshon was blinded by the Philistines (Shoftim 16:21), and this is apparently also the meaning of the words of Nachash the Ammonite to the men of Yavesh Gil'ad: By this condition I will make a covenant with you: if you all put out your right eye (Shmuel I 11:2), as if to say, In order that you will be slaves and prisoners of war to me. For the same reason, King Tzidkiyahu was blinded by Nevukhadnetzar (Melakhim II 28:7), and this is also the meaning of the words of Datan and Aviram to Moshe, Will you put out the eyes of those men? As if to say, Are we considered in your eyes as slaves, prisoners of war, that you will exert your power over us and to do us whatever you wish, to drag us wherever you decide? This arrogance on the part of the enslavers seems to have lasted until much later times, explaining even Herod's blinding of Bava ben Buta (Bava Batra 4a).

  In fact, the entire concept of a POW is largely a modern development

It's not. 

Here's an interesting essay: http://www.academia.edu/3291535/_Rise_Up_and_Kill_Him_First_On_Modern_Attempts_to_Create_a_Jewish_Ethics_of_War_Nova_et_Vetera_10_2012_pp._1183-1213

Goren finds the Talmudic and Mishnaic sources more relevant to moderntimes in their debates regarding issues such as the treatment of prisonersof war and of enemy fatalities:

The ethics of war of any military in the world is demonstrated prima-rily by two categories: (a) the treatment of war prisoners; (b) the treat-ment of enemy fatalities. The contrast between the behaviour of thePeople of Israels army and the other armies at the time, regarding boththese issues, are outlined in the Bible and the Talmud . . . there is clear evidence in the scriptures that the People of Israel treated prisoners of war, including those of foreign armies, mercifully . . . This behaviour was well known among the nations of the world which were neigh-bours of the People of Israel . . . 




 I think it's very easy to make a case for either side and have it be in line with halacha. Have it be in line with what's considered modern values is a different issue.

 As for torture of an enemy soldier for information, while it is obviously unpleasant, I can't see any reason why it would be different from all the other things we do in warfare when necessary. (If you can kill someone, you can certainly torture him.)

I don't believe that halacha addresses this directly and as such, is open to a wide variety of legitimate conclusions on both sides of the issue.
