 I wish I could buy a copy of the 3DS version by that time. Doesn't look like that will happen. 




 My friends can attest to me being an Apple Fanboy. When I hear android, I normally cringe. It's mostly from every android device being different to the point where I hardly even consider them all using a singular OS. (This is different compared to looking at 2 Windows machines and knowing for sure they're windows despite different companies changing the system around in their own way.)

But, to the point of the thread, I've had custom keyboards crash themselves and default to the iOS keyboard. I've also had apps crash from trying to pull up a 3rd party keyboard as I open it from the app switcher. And sometimes, when I tap a box to start typing, whatever 3rd party keyboard I use at the time doesn't show up. And I'm pretty sure the nature of the keyboards and the 3rd party devs have little to do with it and there's only so much they can do to prevent it.

I am very disappointed that it wasn't as smooth or seemless or bug-free as Android users had with 3rd party keyboards. 




 Then keep it open for a few minutes to let it cool. It's not a problem. 




 The point is 100 emails detailing a problem sends a message 1000x stronger than one person detailing the problem one time. Scale that to millions of customers submitting feedback about a problem instead of just a few ten thousand. 




 In this case, the buggy release of iOS 8 has to do with so many things being added under the hood. It was quite the ambitious thing to do to add so many features for an OS that was going to be used across so many devices. What Apple can do now is make sure that iOS 9 isn't about the latest and greatest features but improvements and slimming down of existing features much like Snow-Leopard did for Leopard. If we went straight from iOS 6 to something like iOS 8, then we would have had so much of a flipped up mess of software on the hands of too many angry consumers. At least Apple seems paced while some other companies seem to want to release new products at any given moment to make another buck. 




 You know, I find it kind of funny that before writing about "declining quality" of Apple's software, they could only write about how new features are coming too slow and how unbearably gated (it's not that gated people) the ecosystem is. Now that it's actually branched out with Macs that work well in Windows environments, iPhones with applications that communicate with each other, and new features are coming faster than ever, people completely back off on writing anything good and rush to write how Mac is still *behind* and *doomed* and *far behind Google or Microsoft*.

Tim Cook is doing his best to try to live up to the name that came before him. Let's face it, I don't think anyone is going to let him have any credit compared to Steve Jobs even if Tim Cook is doing a better and far more progressively paced job. 









 Really? Cause I just go to "my computer", open up the drive for my iPhone, then drag and drop all of my photos. 




 At least you can unload your phone's memory onto a computer with the cable that comes with the phone. I'm talking regardless of phone. You can unload most phones right onto a computer if you want. And cloud services are aiming to do that for us so we can delete happily to make room for new files. So why should this be a problem? 




 After two years, you wouldn't want to update your phone?... At all? 




 Wouldn't you want to get a new phone at that point instead of just a new battery? 




 The cycle is already at 3 years. 




 So if Windows 10 is a few gigabytes larger than Windows 8, should we all sue Microsoft for "shrinking" the storage space on the computers we willingly choose to upgrade? 




 And in the meantime, they should also be forced to count Gigabytes the same way a computer does, (per 1.024 megabytes, not 1,000 megabytes). Then maybe we can get a 16GB phone with 16GB instead of a 16GB phone that actually only has 14.9 GB of storage space.

That bullshit is absurd. 




 So I guess we should all sue Microsoft because they're OS takes up so much space that a computer with 500GB of space really only had 485 GB of space.

Here is where my collection stands. If you'd like to make an offer, I'll hear you out. I'm still in the holiday spirit, so I'm willing to make a good deal since I need to unload on extra cards and pay some bills. 




 Based on the solid coding MM had from being an improved engine from OOT, There's something to say about how badly it's been chiseled down from four hours to less than two. And who's to say MM won't somehow be just as torn apart as OOT soon? 




 Meanwhile, in Iraq:

Habib, "We don't have to blow them up. Their cell phones will do it for them!"

Bajejsh, "That's right. Cell phones and gas stations go boom! Thanks Apple Pay"! 




 Ocarina of Time? Try a bit of Majora's Mask. Pretty much the only things we seem to be unable to figure out is skipping New Wave Bassa Nova and Song of Awakening, or warping straight to the moon.

But, by God does the infinite sword glitch simply break that game. It does that by making Bomb hovering possible. In case anybody doesn't know, bomb hovering is possible in Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask by the way the sword functions. Link cannot fall or slip off an edge if his sword's hitboxes are active, so infinite sword glitch combined with block an explosion in the air will cause link to hover. You get off the air by back flipping.

This allows for stupidly crazy stuff. 




 It's Pinkie Pie on a mug. I'm instantly jealous. 




 imgur.com is one popular option. (Downside, since it's popular, there will be rare moments where images won't load on poor connections. Still, it's the most reliable.) 




 You don't upload to reddit. You upload to anywhere else then link to it on reddit. 




 Yep. It will come pre-damaged by water to save you the trouble of waiting for it to break. 




 Yeah, if I ever had a game with such a redo loud amount of DLC, I'd probably make the mundane DLC 29 cents each. Think about it: way more people will be inclibed to buy it and spend a bit more thinking they're gettibg bang for the buck and it could potentially make a lot more cash than suits/skins that cost 2 to 5 dollars a piece. 




 I'd like for shooters to stop trying to depict historic wars and for Zombie games to stop trying to imitate the walking dead or the last of us by trying to push sad stories on you. 




 Technically, the suction on most vacuums don't extend the full width of the base. It's actually about an inch wide at a spot where the tube would supposedly suck it up. The bristles actually end up spitting dirt and grit back out and hiding it under the visible layer of carpet. Plus, the longer the hose, the less powerful the suction. The only Vacuums designed to properly lift dirt and seal it away are those made by Kirby. They're expensive, yes, but even Kirby vacuums that are 5 years or even 15 years old work better than any modern vacuum from any other company.

Turn your vacuum upside down, turn it on, and put tiny pieces of paper in at the edges and everywhere in between. If it doesn't go directly into the hose, it's spit back out. On the floor, it would have split it right back through the carpet. So if you don't have a proper vacuum, you're literally wanking on sand and grit when you wank through your carpets. That's why some home owners replace all the carpet with hard floors. That's why apartments replace the carpets between leases. 




 This was an awesome read. Girlfriend loved it too. So NZA, where do you think Ness stands now? 




 Your opponents cards will never go to your grave yard. Likewise, your cards will never go to your opponent's graveyard. 




 But I'm not better. 




 I'm just putting it into perspective. I've pretty much ran out of gift ideas for anyone. Truthfully, I suck at gift giving unless I know an explicit item. Otherwise I end up buying a gift card and making a card. 




 I thought *I* was a good boyfriend, but that definitely tops me getting my girlfriend a Gold N64 (with matching OOT And MM games, matching controller), and a 3DS for her birthday a few years ago. 




 Of course not for free. If you were going to give them out for free, you would have donated them to some children's home or something. I just know that he loves yugioh, always likes having more cards, lives in Austrailia, and I figured I'd get you in touch with him. 




 I have a friend who lives in Australia. He'd gladly take those off your hands. PM me maybe. 




 This is definitely the right sub. I made this sub to be an environment for all questions Yu-Gi-Oh! related in a shame-free environment. 




 I got my girlfriend a preorder of that the year it was announced. I guess I'm better! Lol. That's great for you. It's a good read. Hope you enjoy. 




 Five years for me 




 I downloaded a stage expansion from http://smashboards.com/threads/stage-expansion-template-for-pm-3-5-36-16-and-12-stage-versions.345936/. I have modified it to only adds 3 stages to the end of the second page. There is an unfortunate side-effect of using this template though.

Although the stages are placed very nicely, the information that's supposed to hang to the right of the preview now dobbles to the left. If you need an example, see [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/IEVSEUg.png). The information here has been moved around heavily to accommodate for the extra stages that would take the right half of the screen. However, I don't have any stages there, so I need everything back where it used to be.

I have a theory that this has to do with the common5.pac of Project M. If anyone can help me with this, I can link you to a download of any files that may be the problem. 




 You *can* edit the original instead of amending it with comments.

 Okay, so for the basics, this isn't like other fighting games. A button sequence will not trigger any hidden or special moves. There are only A and B and combining A and B with a direction on the joystick. (I seriously which my friends would fucking grasp this concept. They might actually get good.) A attacks are considered jabs, tilts, and smashes. B attacks are considered specials. Also, for A attacks, holding a direction and pressing A afterwards is a different attack from pressing that direction and the A button at the same time. These are tilts and smashes respectfully.

Now that those are out of the way, when playing Ness, you'll want to keep in mind that using an aerial attack while double jumping will cause you to fall unless you are still holding a jump button. (Aerials only refer to A attacks in the air. B attacks in the air and still considered specials.) You can do a lot of cool things with this. So, master this concept. Get used to using it to move around he stage in fancy ways and throwing out fancy looking attacks.

Now, when it comes to recovering, Up and B works as another recover move. With Ness, it is quite different. Up and B throws out a PK Thunder that you must hit yourself with. It will launch Ness in the direction opposite of where he was hit. Master this recovery. 




 I downloaded a stage expansion from http://smashboards.com/threads/stage-expansion-template-for-pm-3-5-36-16-and-12-stage-versions.345936/. I have modified it to only add 6 stages on the second page. There are some stupid and nasty side-effects of this though.

For one, the stage name and emblem are still placed as if I were using [this](http://i.imgur.com/IEVSEUg.png). I haven't a bloody clue on how to move it or what I'm doing since Brawlbox's previews for the menu look like a jumped mess of crap.

Also, "- Page 1" icon's position doesn't match up for "Page 2 -" icon. The pages don't exactly match up in the first place, but this is extra annoying.

If anyone can help me with this, I can link you to a download of any files that may be the problem.

EDIT: http://www.lakora.us/brawl/ssseditor/ This helped me get a code that made the stage layouts look nicer. But, the name of the stages are still appearing way off (as if it had to make room for a dozen stages to the right of the preview). 




 BULLSHIT 




 Hey everyone. Yes, you. The one bitching about how Patrick Hoban aparently doesn't know anything. I just wanted us all to remember something.

**Patrick Hoban** is at the top of the tournaments. And **we aren't**. 




 Yet, he's the guy winning tournaments, and we aren't. 




 The point rather wasn't that the 1,000 LP isn't too far is it isn't too much. What monster are you honestly going to take? Tellarknights wouldn't benefit from anything other than a level 4. BA? Level 3. If you're planning to take a tuner and just sync for whatever, you're going to need a varied extra deck to take advantage of the multiple levels you might take control of.

In the end, Snatch steel is still one card from your hand. If your opponent MSTs it, then it's a 1 for 1. If you take your opponent's monster and tribute it, it's a 1 for 1. Stronger duelists don't settle for something that not only requires set-up but is a 1 for 1 at its strongest. If you could get YOUR OWN monster on the field for virtually free (ala graveyard effect or effect of a monster on field, whatever it is) then you've pretty much got something better than snatch steel. In that set-up, not only have you put a monster there, but an MST isn't an out to it in most cases. Furthermore, it will be your monster whose effect you can take advantage of.

In a format where Snatch Steel is in your main deck, you better hope your opponent's monsters have generic ignition effects that you can take advantage of to turn Snatch Steel into more than a 1 for 1. Hoban pretty much has it right. No deck should be relying on Snatch Steel as an explosive strategy. Especially in a format where the monsters vary greatly in level. Not to mention, when you take your opponent's monster and put it in the graveyard, you better consider the potential downside you could be giving your opponent. You'd be taking something worse than a 1 for 1 if you took a Burning Abyss monster and tributed it for something. Even if you Xyz with it, later, it *will* hit the graveyard and boost your opponent's position.

So quite honestly, this isn't a "make me win" card. It's a "win slightly more" card in some matchups and a "definite side-out" in other match-ups. A card like that won't be in a high-level player's main deck. And I'm calling right now that running Snatch Steel at all for tournaments is going to be the minority. (And no, I don't mean local tournaments where everyone will ride whatever hype train Yu-Gi-Oh! is on. Significant tournaments.)

 Just like last gen was pretty much, "Make it a call of duty clone, of at least a first person shooter."  




 Prime 2 must have been a real problem, then. 




 OH MY GOD, YES!

Except if it goes the Dead Space route. Nothing is further from horror than nonstop action with monsters that practically beg for screen time. 




 You would get Zero's effect after the summon goes through. Nothing interrupts a synchro summon, and a synchro summon does not start a chain.  




 Of that move would send you straight toward the corner of two blast zones, then DI would actually risk getting closer to the blast zones. That is when you don't want to DI. A 45 degree angle may not be best if you're on the left edge of a stage being hit toward the right. Your path is more toward a ceiling than toward a corner, so slightly down may be better than no DI.  




 Some people do to make sure it's a good read.  




 May not be creepy for you. But don't ruin it for other people. Most of what I've been reading are the cliches along the lines of 'person ended up being a murderer' or 'narrator is actually dead' or 'narrator is the murderer' (that one's the worst). 




 I think it started out as a minor kink. At night, I would set up a camera and record my wife, Kaley, and I as we slept. When I went to watch it, it would be in short segments. There were times I would find something unusual happening. For example, if she starts blatantly hogging the blanket, I'll rewind and watch it without fast-forward. She knows I do it too. She will even watch with me sometimes.

I don't do anything inappropriate to it. There is no purpose of sexual arousal during any of this. It's just something I like to do. I can't say the same for her, though. I don't usually keep track of what she does 24/7. So let me tell you about some of the funny things I have seen. Don't worry, she and I have both watched all of these parts and agreed to share these.

One time, I rolled right off the bed. But her, being my good loving wife actually picked me up and put me back on the bed. If she wasn't such a light sleeper, I would have woken up on the floor. And we wouldn't have heard me snore on tape. Apparently, I snore sometimes.

Other times, I talk in my sleep. She told me to go over a certain point while watching one night. If only she hadn't heard it. I said stupid phrases like, "I am a cowboy. You better listen to the law." On second thought, I think the stupidest phrase I said all night was, "Bring the fairies in for questioning about the bite of '87." I don't even know what that was talking about.

There was a night when we thought we heard her moaning. Turns out, she was having a dream that night about being with a celebrity. His name was something like Ryan Hanger or something. It was some guitarist she saw on comedy central a long time ago. She wasn't touching herself or anything, but she was making noises. I'm surprised she didn't wake me up.

So talk about wet dreams, there actually was a night when my wife asked me about why I got up in the middle of the night. I had to use the restroom. I did take my sweet time in there. What? I was having a nice long sit. She told me that I must have some talent to get in and out of bed without waking her up. That particular taping began to degrade the resolution.

I always tape over the same video tape. When it gets worn out, I take the tape, burn it in a fire, go down to the basement to get a fresh tape, and put the tape back in the camera. Once I make sure the recording works fine, I leave the camera in position on my dresser next to Kaley's death certificate. 




 That's a question for /r/yugioheconomy 




 Why was he looking forward to spamming limiter removal? 




 **Super-Polymerization**: Banned

I didn't know this card was such a problem. In fact, I've hardly been paying too much attention to Shadoll decks since Burning Abyss have been the top dogs for this format. Not sure if this was actually necessary for current meta or thought to be necessary for future meta.

**Artifact Morltach**: Limited

I feel as though this is completely unjustified. Even if most of my losses have been against Moraltach lately. It just doesn't seem that significant since the engine makes certain back decks better, but it also just makes good decks worse.

**Dark Strike Fighter**: Limited

Supposedly came back because it has new text. So be it, never knew why it was banned. Don't really care.

**Snatch Steel**: Limited

I'm going to have fun with this. I stopped playing when Snatch Steel was still legal and Upperdeck was supposedly still involved in Yugioh. Came back during Macro Rabbit format, and finding it banned was a shock. But I could understand why. But now that it may not exactly be a significant threat, I'm going to have serious fun with it. And so will monarch decks. Just saying.

**Honest**: Semi-Limited

My girlfriend, /u/lily247, freaked. She plays agents and any other LIGHT deck she possibly can. Damage step domination is supposedly not going to play as significant a role as it did in previous formats.

**Goyo Guardian**: Semi-limited

Oh god no. This shit is just stupid. When a fucking noob deck won because of a combination of your own misplay and their reliance on this piece of shit, the game gets more annoying than I care to handle.

**Dark Hole**: Semi-Limited

I'm going to have fun with this. I play Fire Kings from time to time. Not to mention, Burning Abyss can use it to clear opponent's filed and get some searches. Qliphorts can just pendulum themselves back, so I'm gonna have fun with that too. Although, this card will probably be mained at 1 with 1 more in the side.

**NO LONGER ON THE LIST**

* Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwhind

A costless self-summoner that gives you a synchro monster and depletes the power of one of your monster. Who the fuck thought this was a good idea? Brace yourselves, the blackwing players are coming.

* Mermail Abyssgunde

Meh

* Reborn Tengu

I'll probably test this in Hazy Fists

* Reasoning

By freaking god, I'm going to test this in everything I can.

* The transmigration prophecy

Meh. I really didn't think this card was that good when I read it. Glad it's off the list.

**Footnote**

Skill Drain still didn't get hit. BOO FUCKING HOO. Get over it. It doesn't need a hit. Soul Drain is at 1 because Dimensional Fissure and Macro Cosmos fill the same purpose which puts grave floodgates at 3 total. Skill Drain puts the field floodgate at 3 total (not counting anything specific). So fuck you, Skill Drain doesn't need a hit.

Vanity's couldn't at least come down to 2? I guess we're going to continue seeing tournaments decided by who drew the most Vanity's. 




 Microsoft apparently wanted the mac versions to be more like the PC versions which I guess is why Word got that horrible ribbon-like toolbar full of things that menus do for you anyway. Not to mention, they are indeed unstable on newer operating system and base-system macs that weren't bought with the bells and whistles.

In the meantime, I would recommend either trying out iWork or the Mac version of OpenOffice. They're very compatible with .doc formats and don't require much relearning of anything. 




 They will assume you have permission. If you are not selling the sleeves at some sort of profit, you cannot get in trouble. 




 To us. What cards do you have? Post them on /r/ygosales. I might buy them. 




  but they are banking on that most people are too invested in the platform to actually take their business to a competing service

Yeah, I doubt one title will ever be worth switching services. So, good on Valve. At least if Valve said it's because of controversy, a few more people might understand (at the sake of thousands more getting mad that controversy was the reason). 




 I could imagine that for a while, some of that DRM made certain music files unable to be put into iTunes or onto an iPod. I would imagine it's like a site that sells OGG music files trying to sue Apple for iTunes not playing OGG format. 




 I'll tell you know, it sets yourself apart from most combo videos that don't both to do anything more than choose the worst techno song they can find and mute all of the combos. 




 That editing. Definitely a lot more creative than a lot of other combo videos I've seen (which just put shitty metal or shitty techno over muted combo vids). Adding in those sound effects when you did really set this apart. Very good watch. 




 Nope, I never complained about it either. As far as I knew, Apple was trying to make sure you only listened to what you paid for instead of receiving a lot of music files from friends and online sharing sites. 




 Don't really care for the reason, and not a fan of Hatred. But, it does suck when a game with so much support and desire from preliminary fans is rejected for no apparent reason other than Valve said no. 




 I would love to get this amiibo, not for me but my girlfriend and her nephew. It would simply make their year. They are basically having to live with two families in the same apartment which gets cramped quick. It isn't fun. 




 It's hard to feel like we can help you. When you're in danger, you may want to leave out extraneous details. Like "It had rotted *from being in the heat from a metal box*". It had rotted would have sufficed. Also, Nan's personal information was a bit much. It's like you're writing down everything that happens to you because you want us to feel it as vividly as you did.

I feel like this update and the read in general could have been a lot shorter and clearer. With so many details, it's hard to think of any helpful advice. 




 It would take more room on the cartridge and honestly wouldn't make the game feel much different. In fact, when I listen to how some song sound orchestrated from Zelda Reorchestrated, some of it simply sounds off. Some examples are the mini boss music, deku palace, milk bar, and terminus field.  




 Of course it will. If I'm a console gamer with a dozen PC gamer friends who all get their games on PC, I'm not about to buy a console that cannot play with my friends online while another consoles around the same price can.

But of course MS doesn't want to push PC's playing with their console. They want to sell both. And they're trying to use Windows 10 to sell Xbox systems. They don't exactly make money on hardware that Windows sells on. Of course, they'd love to sell a PC to every person in the world, but if everyone got a PC AND an Xbox (because exclusives and non-cross play), they'd be even happier. 









 Time to drop that brand of phone and go with something else.  




 This is driving advice for any time of year. Not just winter. 




 I think that's quite wise of Sakurai. By the time they've got everything working smoothly online with Smash 4, there may be enough competitive results to balance the game more easily (if they decide to balance it). The game definitely has some balance issues. Ganondorf, for instance, is simply too slow to be viable in a tournament setting. He might be able to get away with throwing around items in casual play, but other than that, he's simply too slow to do anything against the faster characters like Shiek and Ditty Kong. 




 I don't run Sphynx. In fact, my current build only runs Peryton and Hydra. 




 I don't get it. The only results were more pictures of chocolate chip muffins and cookies. 




 I very much agree with this article. As a P:M build maker (Add-on builder if you want to call it that), I've been thinking of different ways to label the stages so that every TO can potentially use it instead of just a few who agree with my decisions (or possibly none).

Instead of people making builds that label everything "Starter," "Counterpick," and "Banned" with sub-labels of "Singles-only" and "Doubles-only," we could have two labels instead. One of these labels would be "Tournament Approved" which would be stages widely accepted to be suitable for tournament. The other would be "Casual" which would simply be anything that isn't tournament approved.

There's just about no more doubles-only stages. Those stages have been tweaked to be suitable enough for singles and may be stricken more often than not if someone is playing against a campy character anyhow. So the only sub-label needed would be "Singles Only" for those 1 or 2 stages that are simply too small to hold the chaos together.

And having 13 legal starters instead of 7 (like most tournaments) itsn't that much of a change. The polarizing stage choices will be stricken very quickly. Not much thinking. And those of you saying it would make tournaments much longer... NOT IT WON'T. It's just for the first game of every match, and it will not magically make matches last an extra two minutes. Stage striking takes less than 30 seconds between educated players. An extra 20 seconds wouldn't hurt you, and it would likely increase the variety of stages we see played as starters making tournaments more fair AND more fun to watch. 




 Nope. 




 Nope. 




 I guess the rules will have some tweaking. I'm not thinking of allowing any FTK deck. 




 I was thinking about the many decks that have been called tier 0 or were predicted to be tier 0. I always wondered how these decks would do against each other. So I was thinking of hosting a small online tournament for those decks. Everyone involved would have the choice to run certain decks. Among these would be Dragon Rulers w/ babies, Airblade Turbo, Goat Control, Perfect Circle and a few more.

Special rule: main deck cards would be limited to what was printed while extra deck can use anything out today.

Which decks would you want to see represented in this tournament? How interested would you be in participating?

Edit: Okay, so I'm thinking of rebranding it into a "Full Power" tournament. Choose any deck (sans FTK) that was top in its format and run it with any modern extra deck cards. 




 Meanwhile, on /r/yugioh101

We're happy to answer any questions there. 




 Use two monsters to make a 4 material XYZ monster. 




 Use two monsters to make a 4 material rank 6. 




 If you want, bring paper and pencil to track life points and write down each change in points and cause of change. (Simple as attack or effect would suffice). You're technically not allowed to take notes on complicated things, so keep things simple.

Also, if you suspect you'll need counters or tokens, have them ready beforehand. A token can be any object other than a Yugioh card (unless it's a token card or a card modified to be a token) as long as you can tell whether the token is in ATK or DEF position. Counters can be any object as well such as pieces of paper or tiny pieces of cardboard or dice placed on the card that keep track of the number of counters.

If you're running tokens that often vary in effect, write down the stats of the token on a piece of extra paper or sleeve it with use dry erase marker so you can change it as necessary. Example would be a racoon deck.

This is pretty basic stuff that most duelists understand if they regularly attend tournaments.

Remember to call a judge if you're unsure about something (tournament matches only). Don't take your opponent's word for it especially if they get mad that you don't believe them. Sometimes they are right and just mad that you don't believe them, but other times, they are wrong and are mad that you don't believe them. But remember, Judges are not there answer questions that start with "can I do this.." or "if I did this, could he do...". Judges are to clarify what is happening, not give advice about what you can/cannot/should/shouldn't do. 




 It's one of the reasons I play as Bowser from time to time. 




 When you activate an effect, announce it. I can't believe how many duelists don't understand this. Especially online. You can't just say you're activating an effect. Announce the card whose effect you're activating, which one you're activating, and pay cost BEFORE asking your opponent if they have a response.

If you're entering without a deck that is meant to be competitive in a competitive and complete state, then don't expect to be lucky. I'd advise to just have fun and see how you do and learn from other duelists. It's a learning experience.

Write down the cards you see most often. Specifically, the ones you don't know. If you don't know a ruling for a card, write down the card and ruling and get it confirmed somehow. Writing things down helps retain information, and hopefully, in one day, you'll learn a good portion of the most real-life meta rulings. 




 Dragon Ravine to 1. Possibly. Not because I want it back, fuck dragunity rulers. But I think it still wouldn't be a problem with Burning Abyss and Qliphorts running around.

~~Stratos to 1~~ Or not. I really don't fucking care.

---

Now with the obligatory stuff out of the way. I can get into what I think could happen vs what I think should happen.

**Vanity's Emptiness**

Should go to 1 | Might go to 1 or stay at 3

I think it's rather bullshity that many decks may sometimes just need that one special summon (no more, just one) to get what they need. But this card completely denies it if the opponent doesn't immediately have a mystical space typhoon ready. 5Ds has made its money. Vanity's is still absurdly hard to find, and afterwards buy. It literally defined a format.

**Skill Drain**

Should stay at 3 | Might go to 2 or 1

I really can't say. Even with Skill Drain builds of Qliphorts, Burning Abyss has been handling the hell out of them. Yeah, it still sucks when you don't have an MST and there's none in sight, but let's be honest, how many decks actually main this card? How many of those decks are meta? About 1. And it hurts one of their own monsters. This is where having a deck with graveyard effects or doesn't completely rely on monster effects comes in handy. This is where a grind portion of your deck, a portion that can hold out until you have removal, is important in a format without Heavy Storm.

I really don't want my favorite trap card to be hit.

**Heavy Storm**

Should stay at 0 | Might stay at 0 or go to 1

Why do I say this? Because if Burning Abyss is finally scraped a bit for the sake of promoting new cards, then I don't see how Pendulums can stop being a problem. I think it definitely should stay at 0 since it first and foremost is an OTK enabler. Not only does it enable OTK decks, but entire OTK formats. We have other cards to deal with face-up spells and traps, even multiple ones at a time. It's closed-minded players who see Heavy Storm as the only good way of countering Pendulum decks.

**Wind-up Carrier Zenmaighty**

Should go to 1 | Might stay at 0 or go to 1

Call it by it's real name, people. Please. You're not being clever by calling it "party boat", and newer players are left clueless. Seriously, this card at 1 with the other Wind-up hits might make for just a mediocre troll-deck at best.

**Rekindling**

Should go to 2 | Might stay at 1

I just don't think Rekindling is all that good. The decks that use it right now aren't that good. It not only requires set-up, but banishes anything you don't get rid of which forces you to choose your xyz play immediately. Not to mention cards like Vanity's Emptiness and Solemn Warning are huge right now.

**Torrential Tribute**

Should go to 2 | Might stay at 1

I just think if Pendulums are going to turn into a problem, we should have multiple solutions to reoccurring summons. This wouldn't fix anything, but would certainly help. It would also help Fire King and Chain Beat players a lot. Let's face it, those decks aren't that good. 




 This shit has been on the front page five times already. Stop up voting blatant reposts. 




 I suppose Bowser shouldn't shake the screen either. 




 I got it. You fucking prick. I knew what you meant. I thought the joke was just telling me I should get my wording right. Now fuck off. 




 10 tellarknights, 10 traps.

Or, failing that, 3 Cyber Dragons, 2 Dyber Dragon Core, 2 Cyber Repair Plant, 2 trap stun, 11 draw cards. 




 Yeah, I'm pretty sure Aonuma has learned his lesson about large worlds. He's made quite a few, the best in my opinion being The Windwaker. (Wow, have I plugged so many hours into that game with a single file.)

Besides, Skyward Sword's world didn't seem big to me. The loftwing got you from one side to the other in five minutes. As far as exploration goes, I didn't do much because of the lack of incentive to do so. Zelda U, I hope, will increase that incentive if Aonuma does as promised. 




 I don't see the word "3DS" or even "DS" anywhere in this page. 




 He's working on Majora's Mask 3D which is more than probably going to influence his decisions and ideas on Zelda U. Especially if Miyamoto has something to say about it. 




 His wife's children aren't his. 




 Apparently, they expect you to have been doing work for free for 2 years before getting paid for it. I'm sorry, but isn't practicing my skill while learning it experience enough to get started doing it? Don't you want to be able to mold me and brainwash me instead of having the ideas/ideals of different companies when you hire me? 




 I've seen this on five fucking memes now. Can we NOT upvote this shit to the front page every time someone posts it? 




 Seriously, maybe the new puzzles are figuring out HOW to get to where you want to go. A page from the book written by Metroid. Sure, sometimes you know where to go or have a map, but getting from point A to point B may not be as simple as walking the straightest line. 




 My personal favorite boss from SS was Tentalus. Not so much for gameplay or difficulty, but it was an epic fight started with the epic escape that the boss made necessary. I hope more of that creativity comes into introducing bosses. "Oh, boss door, let's go in, and..." small custscene, boss shows himself off, start boss fight.

Am I right? 




 This game *is* coming from Aonuma. This is pretty much the guy who brought us a living, breathing, almost sentient-feeling world of Majora's Mask. I'm pretty sure he isn't going to completely screw up in the living breathing world portion of the game. 




 I got bored of Skyrim after seeing a friend try to show me the "awesome things" about it. He spent 20 minutes in a menu doing almost nothing. I said, "fuck that". No game where you spend more time in a menu than playing is worth it.

Then cue him doing a 20 minute dungeon for the same amount of gold that the loot from a single enemy could give him. Oh, and a potion. Don't forget that 1 potion. 




 Hard to improve on that. WWHD gyro was pretty damn awesome. Only thing they could really do is have an option to adjust the sensitivity. 




 That the main quest doesn't make you want to complete it. That side-quests will be more fun, more engaging, and actually be the bigger reason for logging in long hours than the main quest. The big fear that all these side-quests and mini-quests will be nothing but trivial and repetitive leaning no desire to get 100% on the game.

Basically, that's it becomes Skyrim with a Zelda skin.

I really don't think this fear that the world will just be open and bland with no villages, NPCs or things to do in it is justified. They have almost a year to fill this world in. Let's give them a chance to do so before just saying "bland and boring is this world". 




 The hilarious, yet sad, thing about this is that it happens. My friend, let's call him Dillin, has a wife and 3 kids. None of them are from the same dad, and none of them are his. 




 Depends on how easy it will be to get a PGLD one and how many people want the PGLD one instead of the original or tin prints.

PGLD Extremely easy to get? A lot of people want it? Other prints could drop 5-6 dollars.

PGLD Very hard to get? Not a lot of people want it? Other prints might drop 1-3 dollars.

PGLD Very hard to get? A lot of people want it? Other prints could drop between 1-6 dollars.

A lot of this depends on who wants it though. If the people who want it are selling their old ones, that could in turn raise the supply of old ones while their demands go down. Lower prices for old prints. 




 She *could*, but that's not the point. 









 My family still assumes that I'm as immature as a 6-year old. That started when my girlfriend gave me a rainbow-dash shirt during my first Christmas as a brony. They couldn't believe that I would watch the show. They've never seen it, and have never given it a chance because of their impressions on the previous renditions of the franchise. To make it worse, my eldest brother sees it as *another* reason to call me gay. My mom continues to question my interest and sexuality and taste in shows because my oldest sister watched three minutes of generation 1 and gave up on it.

It's bucking annoying. In my family, you can joke about killing each other, beat each other up, give gag gifts, and even watch extremely violent and/or satanic shows for a laugh. But watch an episode of My Little Pony and everyone starts questioning everything about you.

My girlfriend's family is a lot more accepting it, and every day, I like start to like them more than my own family. Not all of my girlfriend's family doesn't all watch, but they are much more understanding of why we like the show.

I can handle some stranger on the internet or passer-by assuming I masturbate to cattle or horses, but my family simply not giving it a chance or hearing me out on why I like it just makes me wish I had a different family.

I don't necessarily watch The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Glee, or Breaking Bad. But my family spans all of those and I at least respect them. I don't call my sister a geek or loser or assume she's a talent-less wannabe for watching Glee, nor do I think my eldest brother is a meth-head or accuse him of being a marijuana junkie for watching Breaking Bad. But I respect what they watch.

I'll be glad once I get my own place, since then I'll finally be surrounded by fellow bronies.

(Wow, I just realized that Bronies act more accepting than my fully Christian family. Seriously, the only family I can think of that hasn't been judgmental about it is my brother-in-law who is a pastor.) 




 _ PMDT DOESN'T OWE US SHIT _ 




 Because of high rates, not something that would be worth it for either of us. 




 It's not a quick effects. You can only activate it during your own main phase.

Destroying a spell/trap does not negate the effect of the spell/trap. The only exception is destroying continuous spells and traps which must be on the field to resolve. 









 Yeah, all 14 ounces. 




 This is a load of bullshit. Those cops aren't doing their duty. If there's cops to talk to, then obviously, there's SOMEONE free enough to approach a house, knock on a door, and demand a stolen phone back and possibly make arrests for theft and any other illegal activity that household has been up to.

Tell the cops you tried to ask for the phone back but they shot a gun at you. Then they'll have no choice but to investigate. If that doesn't work, tell them you just shot them and got your phone back yourself. That will surely get their attention.

Or, you could keep recording (on video) evidence that they definitely have your stolen iPhone, report it to the news, threaten your city council rep and mayor that you'll vote against them if your tax dollars refuse to protect you from theft, and capture the world's attention if you can. A country or county's cops are a piece of shit if they pick and choose who they help. 




 I have a Cyber Dragon Deck which I'm taking apart and selling. I really need the money right now as I struggle to find a job and pay college loans.

I'm not leaving the game by any means (I'm using a budget deck right now). I'm moving on to a different deck after Cyber Dragons anyways.

I'll accept reasonable offers on big bundles. I have a few more cards to sell that I will be putting here at a later time.

In the mean time, [Here's a link](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs) to what's for sale. Just ask about price/rarity.

I'm not trading, nor can I buy right now.

 My friend got top 8 in his locals with Agents and he was the only one in top 8 not playing Qliphorts. I found that rather mind-blowing. 




 I just tested this out in Devpro. It actually works. The techs work. The choices work. It all works, and it makes the deck more flexible than most tellarknight decks. 




 Constellation Kause becomes once per turn.

Satellarknight Deneb cannot search for a Tellarknight monster you control.

Hazy Flame Pillar doesn't allow non-tribute normal summons.

Dante cannot mill more than one.

Mermails changed types around and worded so only discarding for the big summons gets any effects from discarding. (Okay, not so subtle, but would hinder them slow unless they drew just the right hand). 




 It's a first look. Why would you reveal anything spectacular on a first look? It's a few small parts of the over world. They haven't even scratched the surface. Why the fuck is everyone so skeptical? 




 I'd rather play this than Skyrim. 




 Hitting the mark is miles better than $60 beta testing programs and day 1 patches. 




 I think we should all stop being skeptical. One of the fun parts of Skyward Sword was that environment was turned into a puzzle. This looks like it can bring similar yet more subtle experience. It's taking a part of Metroid's formula of turning the simplicity of point A to Point B into something that you need to figure out. Plus, a world this eerily detailed has the potential to hide the most subtle secrets for small but rewarding returns (unlike Skyrim where you might do a whole dungeon for a small amount of gold and a dirt cheap potion).

Plus, I bet, that this world to turn out just as beautiful if not more beautiful as anything Bethesda has tried to do. And they likely didn't put nearly as much effort into just making sure every object's every last wrinkle can be seen. 




 "I can get it for five dollars at Franks".  
-ultra rare breakthrough skill.

"sorry, it's getting hit for sure,".  
-Evils warm Option

"that's not for trade ".  
-a card they really should not put in their binder if they are not trading it

"you have any (insert card I have)".  
-"oh, I'm sorry, I'm only looking for the ultimate rare"

"yugioh prices is always wrong".  
-their other site's prove ends up benefiting me instead of him, so I just let it go.

Just to elaborate, I was willing to value my exciting at 20. Based on yugioh prices. He saw 30 dollars for the same exciton and offered me 25 for it. I took his offer.

Also, please fucking learn how to use Yugioh Prices. It checks everything at once for you. If a value seems unusual, click on the fucking listing and verify it.
