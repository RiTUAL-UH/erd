Re: 	Evidence Needed

 nbsp;

Hey, Will. Sorry for taking forever to get back to you, I was searching the evidence room for the journal. Again. Its been gone for weeks though, and I doubt well find it in this  building. The tapes still dont show anyone leaving the room with any object that hasnt already been accounted for. 

I still have the online copy Mary made, though, so itll have to suffice. Not sure why you need it right now, but Im sure youll tell me later. Are we still down for Saturday? You havent replied yet and Amys getting on my ass. 

Anyway, have a good night. Call me later.

If you find this, please dont try to figure out where I am. Take this and run. Destroy it if you make it home alive. Make sure no one ever knows of our legacy.

I know now that there is no god, but for gods sake, burn any trace you can.

All you need to know is that this is our birthright. This is humanitys womb and bones.

We have to find a way out. There has to be an end. We could always see either side, but we never got any closer. Not until last night.

We stuck with one direction, and for the first time, I think were actually making progress. I think were getting closer to the other side.

Well spent one more night in this forsaken tunnel, but after that, well be free. I know we will.

*September 12th, 2013*

We cant get out. It doesnt make sense. We spent three days walking back and forth in the tunnel. It doesnt matter which side we go to - the exit only becomes farther and farther. Three days spent walking until the blood in our shoes made it nearly impossible, screaming until our ears rang for hours, sobbing until there was nothing left. Three days worth of stomping on that picture, over and over again, trying to deny its existence. It was only a short time ago that she finally ripped it apart. Now, we dont have to think about it anymore. Now, there is only the future.

The horrible, agonizing, unending future.

There was a picture in the middle of the tunnel

It was [scratched out, unintelligible]

Who couldve taken that picture?? WHO

I can feel its eyes

*September 9th, 2013*

For the first time in days, maybe weeks, I feel hope. We found the tunnel! We have to be getting closer now. I still dont see the road, and the area around the tunnel is just more trees, more forest, but thats okay. She said we might be able to find the road on the other side of the tunnel. I know there was a parking lot nearby that side. It cant be much farther now.

Now that Ive got a grasp of hope, Im not letting it go.

*September 8th, 2013*

I cant let that happen again. No. I was so scared and mad, and for what? Not like it did us any good. We probably became even more lost thanks to our hysterics. But I think Ive got control of myself now. The actual time part of my watch is broken - its stuck on 8:27 AM - but the date continues to work, so I know how many days have passed. Its easy to lose count of the sunrises and sunsets. 

We have nothing. They kept everything when they let us go. Our camp gear, our individual possessions, everything has been taken. I hid this book in a safe spot, out in the woods, and it was still there when we were released.

Weve been hiding. I know they told us we could only leave if they couldnt find us, but I dont know if they really meant it. We cant hike forever. 

I write whenever we take breaks. I write instead of sleeping a lot of the time. I found that two hours is just enough rest to keep me sane.

She doesnt say much of anything anymore. Only what she needs to say. I only see her cry when she stares into the fire. I dont know if she knows I can see.

We have to make it out.

[Undated Entry]

They said theyd let us go. They said! Theyd let! Us GO! And here we are, circling and circling these damn woods. These damn goddamn fucking WOODS! CIRCLING AND CIRCLING AND CIRCLING AND

I hateyou! You said youd let us go! Why the fuck did you L I E? How could you? I know youre hiding us, and I know youre hiding!

*September 4th, 2013*

Were getting deeper. We found a craggily rock that looked over the tiny creek and sat there for a while. It was starting to get dark, but it felt like the sun was doing us a favor, stretching out its light for as long as it could. It was 7:05 PM but still just a bit past sunset. We really shouldve been setting up camp while it was still light, but we procrastinated, just talking. I dont know why; there isnt much we dont already know about each other. We werent saying anything important, just blabbering about various nature facts and some funny things that happened to us weeks ago. I keep getting the impression that shes trying to put off saying something.

I wonder if shes afraid well die. I mean, obviously she was, but I wonder if that feeling is still there. I want to curl into her fear and make myself at home. Her fear would comfort me, because it meant that she still loves me. Loves herself.

 nbsp;

*September 3rd, 2013: Part 2*

Were here now. Weve been making various signs and symbols for ourselves so we can find our way back more easily. Its mostly just killing time until we actually go into the forest. 

Im going to try to write as we go. Our phones still just barely work, so I need this to keep me from going insane. Im not going to go crazy.

I know this is a terrible idea, but I dont know what else we couldve done. We just want the nightmares to end.

Heading out.

 nbsp;

*September 3rd, 2013*

Were going. Theres no doubt about it.

She woke up screaming my name. I tried to comfort her, which turned into her comforting me. We sat in bed, clutching each other, crying and trying to not look around the room. Every light that still worked in the apartment was turned on, but we never left the bed. After a while we thought we heard the sound of a metal screen door opening and closing. We dont have one.

The morning after she said we didnt have a choice. We need to go. We need to figure out why this thing wont let us go. We need to see what it wants us to see. I was too tired to argue, and didnt speak up until after she threatened to go without me.

I dont want her to leave me here.

Were planning on spending at least one night out there. Its already half passed three and I know we wont have enough daylight. Still, shes packing like were going to be gone for weeks. I keep asking her Why pack this? Why pack that? hoping shell admit to something, but she always replies, Just in case. 

Ive been hiding in the bathroom to cry, but were still sticking to our rules and never let either of us be alone for more than two minutes and forty-two seconds. I dont want her to know how afraid I truly am.

I started a different journal, just in case. I burned the old one, just in case. Now Ill never have to see it looking at me through my dotted Is again. 

Weve got the last of our gear. Time to go.
