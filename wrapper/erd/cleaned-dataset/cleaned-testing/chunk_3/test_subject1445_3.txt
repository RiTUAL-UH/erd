 :)  Thanks.  A current mini marathon of How I Met Your Mother is also helping me out.  I just wish I had a time machine to halt everything and think things through!  That, or enough money to drop everything and travel down under, where I've always wanted to 




 I get that.  This time last year when I was drowning in coursework, etc, I never really hated it or felt like leaving it forever.  
It's hard that most of my friends in the program are not only going to medical school (many have already been accepted, ridiculous) but are *supposedly* just loving their projects and feel like they are in the right place.  I am definitely the outcast of the group.
But thank you :)  Any advice from anyone is truly appreciated.
