 A while ago in my apartment we had a lot of dishes to be washed. So what we did was take a shower while making meals with the remaining clean dishes. After we finished, we cleaned those dishes in the shower bath, so they would not increase the pile, and the cycle continued.

 **The end, from The Doors.**

Those who already listened to this song will know why. 









 Hey man, you are a very talented musician and your videos are **AWESOME**! Do you have a band or any of the sort? 









 We know very little about the universe. I mean, we do know a thing or two but, in scale, the universe is an unknown for us. So, my theory is that: if a **''never-seen-before infinite amount of energy''** strikes Earth in a fraction of second, destroying everything that we know, we all would be dead so fast that none of us would feel it coming. And this can happen at any time! The universe is infinite, so no one can prove that a disaster like this can't happen. It just freaks me out thinking that we could die at **ANY** moment due to a unknown space event of enormous strenght... 









 WOF. 




 That's definitely a disturbing story, I had never read one that involved something changing it's color. 

Nice site though!
