 What if you tank better drunk? 




 Oh just wait! 




 Oh God, this scene. D: 




 By higher level I meant 50 on. Should've clarified: I'm aware Shield Oath and Shield Lob both help increase hate, but I've never been particularly good at keeping hate 100% of the time (which I know is impossible, but I need to humor the idealist in me). Flash, as was previously mentioned, only does so much, but I really needed I think to utilize rotating through targets more. Usually I just spam Flash/Halone combo/circle of scorn -- then provoke on any enemies that aren't in range of Flash, but it doesn't always work, and whenever I'm not Tanking I always notice those tanks who more or less keep Aggro 95% of the time.  




 Hey guys,


I was curious on how to maintain aggro most of the time in the higher level dungeons. Lately I've been having issues maintaining it, and spamming Flash isn't necessarily the best strategy. Would it be best to alternate between targets that you are attacking in order to maintain aggro? I've never really been completely sure of how exactly to go about this. Nobody I've queued with has really complained about it, but I've been wanting to learn to maintain it firmly. 




 I've noticed from experimenting and using Fracture as a PLD that it's really not all that useful, so I am scrapping that. All of the comments here are quite helpful, so thanks!  




 Whoops, you're right! For some reason I was envisioning an A minor7 b5 in my head and didn't think in terms of a Major key.  




 Hey guys, so I have an i90 PLD and am in the process of leveling my MRD for cross-class abilities. Which ones should I go for? Are there any other abilities that would be beneficial to the PLD job?
