 take a few hundred then turn it in. 




 Female? Khakis, black pants, or black jeans. Nice dress shirt or tank with a cardigan. Be friendly and treat it like a conversation with a friend. You'll be find. 




 Intelligence - 8.5

physical - 6

sexual abilities - 9 




 Take her to grab a coffee or ice cream before the party. Best of both worlds. 




 Yes, of course ask her! If you like her enough to post this, then do it! Don't text her. At least call her. Or text her to plan a skype date then ask her. If you want to spend a little bit, send flowers with a note. Or, just make the drive. 90 minutes isn't too far.

Just do it! 




 I can't answer this for you because it's all your feelings. forget about the girl moving or her sleeping around. Now which would you prefer? You said you're in love with number 1, remember?

Go with your gut. 




 Yes. Funny in a sarcastic, friendly or witty manner is very appealing. The kind of funny where you make fun of other people, are obnoxious, or make poop jokes is not attractive and quite annoying.

BUT, be yourself. Don't try and become a comedian, just be you. 




 Yes, they can most likely refer you to some type of counseling.

Just tell them how you feel and all your symptoms. What helps is to write a list beforehand so they know everything. That's pretty much it. I recommend a psychiatrist over your regular family doctor though. If you're still in college, they usually have free counseling and a psychiatrist on hand for your convenience.  




 A form of coping. Plus plenty of meterial. You look at the world differently because your brain lists things of importance differently. Making people laugh for me is one of the things that gives me self confidence and being sarcastic and witty is a way to stay sane for me, if that makes any sense.  




 He looks just like beckham to me.  




 No 




 A really bad paper cut wound. 




 Riding gave me sore thighs for like 3 days. Once I woke up with pretty bad scratches on my legs in all different areas, I think from a bunk bed. And of course bruised knees, which is a horrible cliche.

Man I miss rowdy sex.  




 I think this is the winner here. 




 French fries and mayo 




 All mom and pop, nonchains. I don't understand why people go unless you're out of town and unsure.  




 Interesting question. I'd have to do some calculations and see what tools were provided for me. I think $400,000 may be acceptable for the client and myself. 




 If she is actively trying to work on herself and an adult, then no, I'd let her try therapy and be just there for her. Talk to her first, say you want to say something to her parents and think she needs more help BEFORE making a big move. 




 Um, probably just a guy that can be my friend. When you're a friend, you give a fuck about them and can also shoot the shit with. 




 ask your neighbor. if he hassles, tell him you'll buy him mcdonalds.
Or craigslist.
Or call the local news for help. Or a radio station. Or yik yak.
Or be like the girl from that one college that said she would carry around a mattress until her rapist got expelled, which then led to multiple people carrying the mattress FOR her for weeks. 




 you sound like a fun friend. Your girlfriend as well. Keep it up. 




 was he gay? 




 I thought bets like this were just stupid jokes and nobody followed through, mostly because we all forget about it 5 minutes later. It sounds like you wanted it...

But seriously, I don't really find this a big deal. Is that bad? 




 I'd say keep a job and get a degree in something first (if you don't already). In the meantime, expand your horizons. Say "yes" more to people inviting you to do new things, take up a hobby, read something you find interesting. Then make a list of things you like to do. Not like "taking people's temperatures" but more of your character traits and what eases you/excites you. Discover who you are by what gives you internal pleasure or drive. 




 Maybe you should talk with someone to get past that. There's one thing to be naturally introverted, but this seems like something that's holding you back from greater things. I'm really sorry this happened to you. 




 Sex and killing people... but not in that order. 




 vegetables... what's really great is homemade veggie chips or fries. Basically just roast stuff in chip or dry form and pretend it's a junk food. carrots, zucchini, kale, turnips, etc 




 relaxing or not multitasking. I always need something to do, to work towards. huge perfectionist.

other than that, I cannot stand dishes in the sink!! 




 as fast as my heartbeat. 




 bossypants - tina fey 




 Eat fast food you have back home. Rob a bank, rape, stone a woman. Insult our military. Use racial slurs.

But other than that you can do anything. If you're asking what major sites are overrated and not worth your time, start a new thread. 




 One I love is I Wanna Get Better by Bleachers.

Gym class Heroes/Travie McCoy have a few but I can't remember the titles now.

Otherwise by Macklemore 




 Same At my schools. If your parent didn't call in the morning, you got a phone call home by an administrator, or if it was high school, you got a recorded message saying you weren't in.  




 I always just stayed home. once I went to a hockey game though. I wish I would have forged more early dismissal/late arrival notes though. I went to school far too often.

College is another story.  




 Until you get addicted.  




 I was going to post something similar but I didn't want reddit to judge me because I judge a guy by their looks. 




 Depends how it's done and by whom. If he doesn't cat call or say "yo mami", I think, "wow! I'm not that ugly! At least one part of me is nice!"

Other than that I just get uncomfortable and scared.  




 Don't be late or shy. Know when you can work.

I was like 10 minutes late and didn't plan my other jobs schedule to tell them my availability and fucked it up. 

Oh, and dress nice. 




 Shameless! Best show on tv.  




 Were you at a party or with other friends? If so, get them to hang out again and make sure she comes. From there, get her number. If it works well at the get together, ask her there if shed like to get coffee or a drink. 

Pretend Facebook never existed and it's 1985. 




 Yes of course. Did you think it's like the CEO or manager of something? If so, wear a pants suit. Other than that, wear a cardigan, nice shirt, and slacks. That works for most jobs. 




 Panty selling probably 




 Not surprised one bit. 




 Probably either be engaged or married. With a career. Would be pretty down on myself if I was without either. Definitely moved out as well.

As far as activities, I'd like to get my car inspected by myself. Travel oversees again. Volunteer in a different country. Rock climb! 




 No you can never please everyone, whether it be the countries people or other countries. However, like the other comment, Switzerland is inching there and I think Amsterdam is doing well. 




 Just like every day- wake up and say "today im going to be great!" Take a hot shower and grab a coffee and remain optimistic. Find something to look forward to! Like next weekend of an amazing dinner you're going to cook when you get out of work. It may sound cliche but you if you tell yourself you're going to have a good day, you'll start believing it. 




 i looked in here before watching but idc, she's dead?!/ yess! 




 I would have thought he meant standards. Like it's easier than you think.  




 tell me about the teachers lounge and any gossip about the teachers. 




 This is absolutely insane to me. I know people in NY that have their masters in teaching and can barely get a subbing job.  




 what site posts the quickest? I need to get to bed early tonight but want to watch ASAP. 




 Yeah I always need to be working. Just got 2 jobs for 60 hours a week. Because the job schedule, I still have afternoons free and I'm off all day Tuesday and I hate it. It's actually a problem, I always feel bored or lazy. 




 I think I had a mental breakdown in my lifetime, yes. But tonight (slightly dramatic) I have not. Hanging in there  




 I'm hoping my new jobs get me to slim down because I'm phat 




 Woohoo! I miss those early days, like my first 5 times having sex. Lots of nostalgia for that point in my life. I had sex last week and it felt like a daily routine, like brushing my teeth. *sigh*

Watching the walking dead tonight? 




 How old are you?

How many girls have you had vanginal sex with?

How do you handle sex? Like, do you just assume to not thrust so far in or what? I don't have a penis so that may be a stupid question.

Oh, and where do you live? I'm interested.... 




 Damn... 




 I love Belgium! I want to go back right now.
 




 What's the word, baby bird? 




 Literally everything. 




 I don't buy cheap canned foods there. I make sure if I buy canned food, I try and find low or no added sodium and/or sugar, possibly organic, brands which aren't normally carried by these stores.

I'll buy store brand names for pretty much anything. Mom says stick to popular brands for cleaning supplies.  




 Working in food service. Cooking, walking, serving, carrying stock. Plus you get paid! 




 Hahaha I've gotten similar. 




 Cholesterol and eggs.
Fat being "bad." 




 I personally believe in it. I know stuff is probably staged and cut to look and sound different but overall, I feel she is legit.

I might be in the minority here.
