 I really don't know too much you can do because I believe it does partially have to do with hand size. However there's hope that maybe your practice balls are a bit worn. Our team sets aside 3 balls that are top notch and only designated for games, so maybe that'll help your cause. Also maybe just work on some ball handling skills in practice. For instance not picking the ball up on top, or maybe turning your hand during your pump fakes to so it wont fall out. 




 The main goal is to ride the board up. I used to throw my dives early and hard and ya I would get around because it was fast but my height would suffer. Give it a strong push and don't throw for your dive until the board is finished pushing you up. It's hard to get the timing but after a while with someone watching you you'll get the hang of it.
