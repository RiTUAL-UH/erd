 The new Wolfenstein, really good. Old-school shooter, with some stealth bits.

Not as polished graphically as the new Killzone, but I'm enjoying it much more. 




 Yeap, I was pre-caffeinated.

 I guess Labour have learned that you don't send a Turkey to the polls. 




 Maybe they're confusing the An Post people with the repeat Eircom wont-you-come-back-to-us visitors? 




 I don't know what to make of it

 Gilmore said he still intends to seek re-election in Dn Laoghaire at the next general election and will remain as Tnaiste.

Surely, that's only until their new leader is chosen? Then whoever that is decides. He's almost certain to be toxic in a general election, why would he be kept?

 She's the bookies' favourite. 




 She'd have received more votes if she'd proposed criminalising that jacket. 




 I'm hoping it's just in there as the random punt. 




 Hopefully the reply goes something like this:

'Ah Seanie, we're out of cash. Sorry now, yeah see ya. Good Luck' 




 [Paddy Power](http://www.paddypower.com/bet/other-politics/irish-politics?ev_oc_grp_ids=594283) has some good odds ;) 




 As per RT:

Letter sent to Labour's Parliamentary Party chairman,

Motion the PLP

Dear Chairman,

We the undersigned propose the motion that "The Parliamentary Labour Party does not retain confidence in The Party Leader"

Submitted by

Deputy Ciara Conway TD

Senator John Gilroy

Deputy Dominic Hannigan TD

Deputy Michael McNamara TD

Deputy Ged Nash TD

Deputy Derek Nolan TD

Deputy Aodhan O Riordan TD

Deputy Arthur Spring TD

We wish this motion to be discussed on Wednesday 28th of May 2014 at the PLP. 









 That's him.

He's an all-round buzzword spoofer, who frequently requests 'dialog' about things like the "IP concept space". I've been to two conferences he spoke at, wafflle wouldn't begin to describe it.

Then there was [his little temper tantrum](http://www.siliconrepublic.com/new-media/item/26531-minister-sherlock-extends-o) over having to speak at a conference with a panellist who could run rings around him. And Sherlock was by far the least capable or interesting speaker at that one. 




 As a result there are mounting calls for junior ministers [...] Sean Sherlock to be promoted to Cabinet

Oh yeah, that would be the right move - go ahead and do that one

 Another snippet from the Navan count:

Labour is not singing in a chorus on the leadership elephant in the room. 
A Labour councillor who has lost his seat on Kells town council in Meath has said that Eamon Gilmore should go as the leader of the party if he has any respect for the membership and the people on the ground. Having served on the town council for ten years, Brian Collins was eliminated this morning at the Navan count centre having polled just 395 first preference votes. He said: Im gutted for myself but its been humiliating nationally."

 Ouch, not much of prospect for the party either way.

I won't consider a vote for Labour until he's gone. 




 There's the government transparency we were looking for ;) 




 From RT 11.32

Pat Rabbite has said he thinks Eamon Gilmore should continue as leader of the Labour party. He said he did not know if there will be a leadership challenge and said he was not aware of any moves against him.

They'll be in even more trouble as a party if they don't let him go surely.

 If it's mkv files that are the sticking point, why not do a quick convert to mp4?

avconv -i inputfile.mkv -codec copy outputfile.mp4

It will convert most mkv files in about 20 seconds, about 1/10 mkv files won't work with this. But it's always worth the try as you'll know in seconds whether it needs a bigger job, e.g. with Handbrake.

 Ah, it gives the title a very sturdy sounding tone.

 Estranged brothers, the destruction of Alderann was a sore point between them.

 [Jared Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse:_How_Societies_Choose_to_Fail_or_Succeed) was fairly worried about Australia's prospects nearly 10 years ago but I doubt he expected Tony Abbott:

["The final chapters of Collapse are devoted to the contemporary, developed world. The perilous state of the Australian environment gives Diamond reason to suspect that Australia may be the first developed state to collapse under environmental pressures. This may initially seem absurd to many Australian readers, but Diamond demonstrates convincingly that societies typically collapse when at the height of their dynamism and affluence, because that is precisely when resource demand is greatest."](http://www.theage.com.au/news/Reviews/Collapse/2005/02/23/1109046981193.html) 




 Blocklists are a good place to start. 

The one below won't block everything but it will block shock sites / shock porn sites, and also ads (which may not be fair, but I reckon it's a good idea for young kids to not be bombarded by adverts plus it defeats a few trackers - though you'd be better adding ghostery too for that):

And it's updated (at least) monthly, instructions are at the link. 









 I've some R-Pi and Odroid U3 boards - love them.

I use an Odroid as a desktop computer (typing this now with it), and another as a home server. The R-pi boards are XBMC, hobby projects etc.

Really good value, very versatile   noiseless. 









 Going by Sinn Fin's UK MEP Martina Anderson, a vote for them would mean the 'European United Left/Nordic Green Left' grouping.

edit: oops, posted above already 




 True, though we could get 3 seats on the 'European United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL)' via Sinn Fin's gain. 




 Yet VHI et al, do cover it. So why go or stick with Aviva? 




 At just the right time to spare Miriam's blushes too, remarkable.

Miriam first, full debate second. 




 Who would sign up for Health Insurance with Aviva now?

This is skin cancer they're not covering, in Ireland, skin cancer!

We're one of the most prone nations to it.

 




 Nor the HSE.

If the institution ends with an 'e' sound, they're probably chancers 














 Well there are [505](http://www.psychologicalsociety.ie/find-a-psychologist/search-results.php?area= search.x=30 search.y=7 option=) psychologists listed on a non-exhaustive PSI list, and more graduating every year. So I'm not sure the number of available clinicians is the problem. 




 They could have 64gb of RAM and their games still wouldn't be worth finishing. 




 He's been very, very naughty 




 Sack the HSE staff in charge of recruitment, I bet the next position holder will get those jobs filled nice   quick.

How an institution overflowing with staff can manage to be so consistently useless at its duties suggests that the executives and managers need to go. If O'Reilly doesn't start sacking them, they'll never improve. 









 And nothing of value will be lost 




 The damage this man is doing to the country is unforgivable. 









 Ain't it peculiar that the last post eoin2017 made was hours ago, yet yours is minutes!

 




 That's the living-end of moisturising - patent   become loaded :) 




 And so much for palm-reading 




 Hard to know based on the details above, the sdcard on an Odroid is usually mounted as 'boot' - it's confusing.

Perhaps directing ustream etc. to the 'boot' drive might help. 









 And hopefully the odd Fada 




 I suppose we could all start taking photos of cars parked in the spots without a permit, and post them here.

 I suppose he could have thought it was a different vote he was being asked on, though if that were the case - he hardly deserves a vote either.

Yeah, completely surprised me.

 Asked whether he thought the issue of water charges would hinder the partys performance, he said well wait and see.
The people of Ireland actually **know quite well** that there was difficult decisions had to be made in the last three years.

So what's the cost per litre of water under Irish Water then Phil?  




 Plus he [abstained](http://www.votewatch.eu/en/us-nsa-surveillance-programme-surveillance-bodies-in-various-member-states-and-impact-on-eu-citizens-9.html) from a very reasonable vote to increase EU citizens' privacy rights post-NSA/Snowden.

Still don't understand that one. 




 Phil, lend me your salary. 









 If we had more like this on T, I'd be inclined to watch it. 




 So does Enda, I think his hair is the only part of him that is doing its job. 




 It would at least need 'like' at the end of it. 




 And how would you describe your second sentence? 




 I can't imagine what it would be like to have been bereaved or damaged by all that violence, yet then presented with a 'blank slate from now on' type solution.

For those that have managed, they have my enduring admiration and a little wonder - bestest Buddhas in the world, I reckon.

 




 I'm not well versed in what really went on up in Northern Ireland, apart from what the media reports. It wouldn't surprise me if there was blood to spare for all the hands involved.

But I thought the whole point of the peace process was: to stop any more violence, and any more recrimination.

I think that first part has more or less happened - so I'm going to accept the second to ensure the first; as wrong as that may be - it's better than more bloodshed.

I'm not looking past the past, I'm trying to look at a calmer future. 




 If you really can't vote for anyone, still go, but spoil your vote - you can even write a little reason why on the ballot and it will get read.

If all the people who don't think it's worth voting spoiled their vote that tally in itself would send a message. Your vote would count in exactly the way you intend.

Always vote, doodle a Dustin even ;)  




 Well, they did insist on voting No to the Lisbon treaty the first time round till we got a better deal out of it - that happened.

And when Brian Cowen's FF refused to hold a by-election for 17 months (instead of within the normal 6) - it was Sinn Fin that went to the courts to get it sorted.

I remember that, it informs my vote - as well as my opinion of the parties that didn't contribute to a resolution. 




 I suppose one way of doing it is seeing who you don't want to vote for.
Work out why you won't vote for them - then see is there's a candidate closer to your ideas.

I can choose with a (reasonably) good conscience 3 MEPs for my 4 seat constituency, but who I want for my 4th - I'm still trying to decide. 




 For security cameras I went with an [Odroid U3](http://hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php) - affordable and more than enough capacity as a home server, security cam, ftp and all the usual goodies. I have 3 cameras feeding into the Odroid and use 'motion' to sense   ftp the images. This barely stresses the Odroid.

They're fanless, quad-core 2gb-ram little beasties with no more of a learning curve than a Pi. Also, they're a tiny bit smaller than a Pi.

I keep the Pi for XBMC   hobby projects. The GPU hardware drivers on the Pi makes them slightly better at XBMC than an Odroid.

But for server, desktop-computer   game-emulator purposes the Odroid is very hard to beat at the price. Plus, the [forums](http://forum.odroid.com/viewforum.php?f=75 sid=10ba83ada948d9cf878eaeaa83530e9d) are great. Do go for an eMMC card if you buy one, much faster than the SD card option. 




 I guess they reckon everyone who had it will double-dip if it comes to PS4.

If it ever did, I'd love a free-fly / move mode and would probably lose days with a level designer ...

"I support the repeal of the legislation which permits abortion on suicide grounds. I will certainly oppose any measures which seek to liberalise Ireland's abortion laws. I am happy to represent pro life in Europe."

And the word abortion doesn't appear anywhere in their manifesto or website. Without this link, I would never have known.
