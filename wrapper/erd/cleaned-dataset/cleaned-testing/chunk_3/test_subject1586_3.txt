 Yes we lost, but we lost with 24 unanswered points in the last 4 seconds to a field goal. Yes we have things to fix, but our receiving corps isnt really one of them in the way that we thought. With Tate down the Ground Pound that is West and Crowell was AMAZING amassing TD's and Yards against the vaulted LaBeau DEF like they were a collegiate team. HOYER THE DESTROYER broke bad in the second half in a serious way. This isnt a bullshit team, and it's gonna get easier from here. *EDIT: Spelling and GO BROWNS*

 




 
Yes
 




 No. That was as a flop, or being scared, or actually being payed by the Steelers on the sly.  Did you SEE how fast his head whipped around to watch the play unfold? That play has "sketchy weirdness" all over it. Either by him not really wanting to play football for a living, or by him throwing this game.  




 I cant even tell they are happening. 




 Like how people still talk about Big Ben and his sexual improprieties? Yeah. Some people just dont shutup. 




 I see you DROPPIN' his name.  




 You're a good man for trying!
 




 Thank you!
 









 I'm there with ya.

 You seem like a man who can find things. My girlfriend has agreed to a Browns Emblem on the car. I want a Chrome Brownie so bad I can taste it, but they are nowhere to be found. Can you find it, sir? Can. You? *edit:spelling*

 




 It's awesome. It's huge, hard to get a table and FULL 
OF ORANGE AND BROWN. I think I'm gonna be there....

 If it makes the Yinzers waste practice reps and brain power to prepare for something that (I hope) doesn't happen, then "more's the better" *EDIT: They will be ready for it all game, and if we don't give it to 'em, then we just caused them extra stress before every play, all game*
 




 I forget that not everyone has the same way of dealing with problems by using humor, that I do. Some people are really hurt by the losses and the problems,  and I don't want to upset them.  I just travel a lot. A lot.  You have to have a good sense of humor, and thick skin, being a Browns fan on the road. And we are Shakespearian in our comedy of errors, sometimes, that I cant help but see the humor.  




 I would have voted for one of each, had there been an option. 




 Right on. I'm just trying to be goofy and bring some levity to the forum, but I am NOT trying to be disrespectful. This place rules and I love being a part of it. I can message y'all if I'm being inappropriate. *edit: SP*

 




 And yet the down votes pour in. LOL. Go Browns. *EDIT: And thank you*
 




 It's a deep level of 'funny' that we didn't fill out the score and place the lone 'W' next to the Bears. We are quick to put the losing scores in, but we subconsciously worry about claiming our victories. Probably because we all think the Browns are the only team in the NFL that could blow a 19 point lead a week after the game's over.  




 I totally stole yours this year

 I personally already think he would look good in that pass rush of ours,  and we already are a media storm,  so....

 I think that after seeing another "Indians go 6-3 probably higher than most Browns scores by halftime" posts on twitter I just snapped a little this morning, and it was early. I have since learned who he is. /r/Browns is the place to learn whatever you dont know about the organization. He seriously just has never really come across my feeds. I'll have to search him out actively for a bit and check him out
 




 Nah, I don't work in sports.  




 Maybe he's just learned how to use Bleacher Report (LOL joke) 




 That is surprising as hell, to me. I live on social media. It's my job. I never see this guys name. I see Plain Dealer, ESPN, Beacon Journal all over my feeds. I never see this guy.  *EDIT: upvoting /u/brownielf for the heads up*
 




 There's always the Titans. 




 All of the sudden this chuckle head has a lot to say about the Browns. All bad. Never heard of him. He just shows up a week or so ago and is just running his mouth. Is he a newspaper reporter? Blogger? Candied Apple salesman in the Muni lot with an ignorant and public opinion? At least Mike Freeman constantly talks shit because he is actively scouting the Browns to find our faults. This guy Tom Reed comes out of nowhere like an "old hand" spraying cat shit. Blarggh. 




 I was good for 3 of those B4B pics. Nice compilation :) 




 Its also titled "Allegedly caught". I can see that SOMEONE doesnt WANT TO BELIEVE.
 




 No, this is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIwgnpTNUkQ 




 Boobs were great during the Reddit Growth Drive, and I will upvote any new submissions, but I am all about it being a seasonal thing. It is like Christmas, or Taco Tontos being closed on Sundays: It keeps things fresh and doesnt allow us to just totally run something awesome into the dirt. 

TL:DR
1: Will upvote boob pics
2: Thinks keeping Boobs 4 Browns seasonal is the way to go
3: Will upvote new boob pics
*edit: grammar* 




 Did you read the part where I said I was a Hoyer fan? You sound like the clown, yinzer. 




 I think he might actually be the Personification of Brownie. Brownies are helpers who thrive on chaotic situations, *like the story of the brownies fixing all the cobblers shoes*, and he seems to only get better when things are falling down around his head; which makes him almost TOO powerful while playing for Cleveland. 
*edit: spelling* 




 I am a Hoyerastafarian. I think he is the right QB to lead this team. With that said: How the hell is Johnny so accurate on the run, throwing across his body, with feet jumbled around like a river dancer?  









 As a Buckeye fan, this constant butt kicking we get from the Steelers makes me feel like Michigan....I am ready for the turn around!

 O-H! 




 Browns fan for 31 years, my family are personal friends with the Equipment Manager from the pre '99 Browns (who is still the Equipment Manager for the Ratbirds) and I have been wearing orange and brown singe I was in diapers, but no: this part of life has eluded me. I feel a completeness. 
*puts on a hat shaped like a femur and eats a milkbone*
*edit: added the '99* 




 It acts the same way I do, with quiet disbelief.

 Pink tie? check. Douchy spiked hair? check. Handlebar goatee? check. Looks like everything is in order here. Welcome to the Jersey Shore. 




 He is a local,  and he is schizophrenic. He had never talked to me before (I'm new in town) and today he came up to me and told me about "Sound and Light Terror Grids" he says they are compressing light and sound within these grids, and that it is an attempt to make us blind and deaf. He says that only special breathing patterns,  and REALLY clean water can help prevent it. He also told me they have been working these things on us since we were little. I don't discount crazy. I do however run it by reddit. 




 Its true. My exploits on reddit often take me to making fun of Ravens fans, which is a celebrated pastime in Cleveland. Since it doesn't get me just over flowing buckets of upvotes, (as you can see on both your post and this one) maybe I'm just doing it because I enjoy sharing, and not because I am garnering some kind of up vote support. I get my life fulfillment from traveling, my job as a minister, and having sex with my wife. This is what I do for fun, not validation. So drop the down vote. Ravens suck. Lol. 
*edit spelling* 




 This is not Rallying the troops. This is sharing. Rallying would be if I was asking you to do, anything. Sorry if I offended your reddit sensibilities, /u/chuckyjc05 I'm really just sharing exploits of a Browns fan on reddit with the subreddit for the Browns. 




 I made a comment on the fact that the Ravens are in 32nd place for Reddit growth. I just wanted to share the exchange. Heres the link: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/2ei4v1/subreddit_growth_results_after_the_third/cjztgvu 




 I made a Raven boohoo on this thread because I said "LOL Ravens suck" his only response was "Says the guy with no flair" leave it to the Ravens to bitch about flair usage. 




 I'm also impressed that 4 people other than you don't hate Baltimore. That's a negative Karma score that truly, truly impresses me. 

*EDIT: Since the posting of this, people have upvoted my original from -4 to 0* 




 No. Thats why I hate it.
 




 I'm a Browns fan. Cant wait to see your throwback jerseys, son. 




 The one that really grinds my gears is when I hear a Steeler say "Here we go Steelers Here We Go!"
 




 Lol. Ravens suck.  




 Well, now it's roached.

 You'd have thought they would have hashed this out, by now.
 




 Does a DUI count toward substance abuse? It's a substance based breaking of a law, but it wasnt him failing a drug related NFL rule. I'm still confused on that. 




 I'm sure your statement will weed out those that try to seed this thread.
 









 Yeah, he was sitting on top of 70 passed drug tests and a lawsuit. 




 I never had Gessford, though he retired my Senior Year. I had Atkins.

 At the end of the day we're all AFC North.  









 "Conner Shaw-nuff you right he had a 151 passer rating" I'm still working on it.
 




 I agree with you. I also have been a big fan of him as a pickup since the Draft. My prediction was that Hoyer would get bumped out for Manzeil, then around game 8 I see him getting creamed on a scramble, and then they bring in Shaw and he lights it up not only that game, but for the rest of the,  year. He starts in Johnny comes back at the beginning of '15, plays 2 games, they bring Shaw back, he takes us to the Super Bowl. 
 




 
That's fair: Now I downloaded it to my computer and it froze my whole system up after the 2 hour download and made a weird little window that wouldn't go away, or even let me open my Task Manager, sooooooo now it's confirmed on my box to be a bunch of crap, and a large site doesn't denote a safe site. Gratzi.
 




 I don't know about on your computer,  but on the mobile it takes you to what looks like a phishing page.  Went to real Google Play and downloaded the actual app it asks you to get? Yeah,  doesn't work to open the game up. It still takes to to the same "Download this app to proceed" page.  If you have better luck on your desktop/laptop,  let me know.  




 As a matter of fact, there is even a bar on the SIM. If its connected to the Browns Reddit, we might even be able to get players to make avatars and come talk. They do that with musicians all the time. Trent Reznor will come on play a live show and have his computer set up in the room and it live relays his performance. We could use FRAPS and record the interviews and throw it onto youtube and feature it here. It would be cool to have the first Second Life Browns Backers group. *spelling* 




 So,  Second Life is considered its own country. It has its own currency that is traded on the stock exchange (The Linden Dollar '$L') and it's public, free, and online. Not only that, but I have access to an entire parcel of land that would be all about us meeting there. Just a thought  




  the NFL is a SFW hobby

Yeah.  What with all those role models getting shot, beating their significant others unconscious, battling drug addiction, and murdering folks. 

 




 The OP shames herself by posting naked pictures on an open forum,  and it's not my intention to shame her regardless.  

Uhhhh, That's shaming. You just said she is a shame unto herself,  and then you said it wasn't your intention to shame.  For shame. I'm a left wing hippy (gun toting). I am disappointed.

 Hair draping over boobs :) 














 The ladies from church wanted to help out. :) 














 Let me see what I can do. 




 Well, she IS a Steelers fan...and are you saying he was acting like a "LaBeau"? Huh? Huh? Amiright?  




 Im also wearing an all orange shirt today, and she had on her Steelers jacket. 




 I walked into the bank today, I live in Seattle, and there is this blonde girl that works behind the counter who is a Steelers fan. The very first time that I saw her I joked "Aren't you say Seattlite? Why the Steelers gear?" She looked at me and said 

"I don't give a f*** I like the Steelers they are a good team they win I don't care about the Seahawks I mean I'm a fan I guess but I'm a Steelers fan first."

 After that she wouldn't look at me or wait on me at all so I just went in there today and had to put in a deposit and she was the only one there. I walked up and I said "I'm sorry I give you crap about being a Steelers fan." And she said

 "I don't give a s*** you're just mad cuz we have six and you have one!"

 To which I realized she thought i was a Seahawk fan, so I replied "I'm a Browns fan." Her demeanor instantly changed; a big smile crossed her face and she said 

"oh, well you got 0." 

And I said "yep we've got 0 but I guess we can at least hate the Ravens together"

 and she said "f*** the Ravens" 

and I said "f*** the Ravens" 

and she said "and the Browns" 

I said "hey f*** the Steelers" 

and we both laughed and we said "f*** Cincinnati" 

and then now we're friends and she smiled as I walked out the door. And that is what it means to have the best rivalry in all of the NFL. And I got to cuss in the bank.

 Professional hubris. They want more money than the distributors think they are entitled to, to be distributed.  They lean on the age of their brewery to get treated differently.  When it first made it to GA, I worked at a bar. This is what the distributor told me.

 My teams name is "Jordon CamRon Burgundy's Mustache" I even made a picture last year: https://twitter.com/TheJackalope/status/385529932228476928 




 There is a bus that had a water gun attached to it,  and they soak the new people and they walk by. My grandfather was like: "Stop. Look at the water. Where do you think it came from?" I looked at the bus and it sprayed this huge stream out.  It was awesome. 




 It would be wrong of me to give it away. You should make the pilgrimage sometime!
 




 So you've decided to be a Browns fan? Well, there's a couple things that you need to know to successfully navigate wearing the Orange and Brown. 
 
Number 1: "Don't worry, there's always next year." Now I know what you're thinking: "Why would he be saying there's always next year? We haven't even started this year." This is part of the sacred Tao that is being a Browns fan. It is a mantra that many of us have prayed over, because we know, possibly more than anyone,  that there is no such thing as a sure thing.

Number 2: "We are the hipsters of football fans" I said it. We as Browns fans only support teams that won championships before the institution of the Sellout Bowl. I mean Superbowl. *dons orange and brown flannel shirt, horn rimmed glasses and knit cap*

Number 3: That being said learn who Paul Brown, Jim Brown, Lou Grouza and Otto Graham are.

Number 4: If you're one of the new fans who is going to have the pleasure/privilege/luck of attending home games at FirstEnergy Stadium, be ready to be part of a stadium where you cant have glass bottles! That's right Browns fans like to throw bottles onto the field and the stadium banned their use after one such incident. We are rowdy.  Its fun. 

Number 5: You also can't bring in items from outside, into the stadium. After we could not throw bottles somebody decided to throw batteries.

Number 6: If you get to tailgate before the game in the Muni lot, and you see a large bus. with the ground completely saturated with water in front of it, just keep walking forward and don't contemplate the situation.
 
Number 7: Cornholing is no longer just a sexual slur.

Number 8: F*** the Steelers. (Like for real. We dont like those guys. Ravens[ratbirds] either)

Number 9: Its a Brownie, not an Elf

Number 10: All contributions to televised football aside, we know that Art Modell is actually a multi time failed business man who is the only person to ever bankrupt a football team. 

Number 11: The plain orange helmet is sacred. 

Number 12: Next Year Is Coming. 

I'm sure others may have more to add below, but this is a gift from me, 31 year Browns fan, to you as a bright eyed new dawg ready to get a bark or two out in the pound this year. Welcome. 




 Ummmmm,  no. Aquarian Tabernacle Church marketing guy, yes. (You can check us out @ www.aquatabch.org and our legally recognized seminary at www.WiccanSeminary.EDU The ATC, serving Wiccan needs in 7 speaking nations.) And I hate BP so much I do my best not to use aluminum, because BP controls Lions shares of the aluminum produced in the world. I'm appalled at what they did. My spirituality is one of deep connectedness to the living organism that is our "planet". That being said: I want other opinions so I don't stagnate. And this ish is bugging me,  so I asked y'all. *edited for spelling because my phone is a champ* 




 I had heard that BP was looking to recoup some of what they had to pay out because they believe they over payed. I was wondering what you all thought?
