 I think it depends a lot on the location and what type of statistics you do (e.g. biostats, machine learning, big firms, startups, etc). One of my MS friends started with 55k (Toronto) working as a SAS programmer for a small HR firm, and I've also hear cases where they start with 80k with just 6 months experience. 




 Yeah, this I figured out as well, didn't quite understand why people would use it. 









 Some honest opinions.

1) Why is your team so big? Why do you need 6 people and what do each of them do?

2) Traction to date?

3) Slides 5   6 - I would avoid using the pictures you are using, they make the deck look unprofessional.

4) Why do you want to raise 125k? How do you plan to use that money? 




 I don't quite understand what the site is doing, tbh. 














 I think there are a lot of similar services already, so it would have to be substantially different for most people to start using, IMHO. 
























 I heard nothing. I am just hoping, nothing more. 




 Metroid is a good series, definitely something to hope for. 




 personally, I'd like to see The Elder Scrolls VI. 







































 What's the point of this? Why not just use angelist of some other legit websites? 



















 What's the Shoshone exploit? 




 I see what you are saying, but if you play lower levels, you could lose get a free worker if you declare war early, just not that early.

 couldn't agree less. 




 definitely infantry. 




 Keep on hearing people say deity is so easy, blah blah blah, so I'm really curious how good people really are. Personally, I've never defeated Immortal or Deity. 









 MORATAAAAAAAAAA!!! 














 I didn't meant to say it was my own. Just found it funny and post it here. 



















 Studies in the past have suggested that 1) companies with shorter names tend to do well, 2) companies that start with the letter A tend to do well, and 3) companies with infrequently used letters like Q, X, Z tend to do poorly.  





























 yeah, that seems like what most people want. 









 fair request. 




 What do you consider as sweet stuff? 




 That makes sense. Game prices are high nowdays.
Would you do it for in game ad ons? 














 Was reading this article http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2015/06/03/fallout-4-looks-great-but-you-still-shouldnt-pre-order/

and wanted to know if people would or wouldn't pre-order 



















 One thing I found helpful to some students was just copy the proofs (word for word) many times in your notebook. A lot of times things become more intuitive and obvious after you repeat it many times.
