**Futuristic War Reporter**

Hey guys, here is something I did recently. This is something I wanted to try for a while after seeing all of those awesome futuristic sci-fi close up shot of a military personel from Maciej and all the other amazing artists. But I didn't want to do the exact same thing, a military lady with guns and body armor. So I did a little spin off, a front line reporter, someone who bring you the news from the war zones.

 Not sure about breaking a bone. But having had cancer and had to declare bankruptcy a year later I can tell you that it was expensive. I think I still have a picture of my $135K bill from the hospital and I was not done yet after 2 1/2 months of treatment.  




 When cancer comes back... 

Having had cancer and survived it. This scares me the most. The possibility that cancer will return in a stronger more lethal form is something that keeps me up at night.  




  Its time to call America what it is: a kleptocracy, run by corporations and governments with only cosmetic distinctions. It is full of good people whom the kleptocrats keep fighting against each other, as they have for over 150 years, and will until the good people drown in rising saltwater or epic storms, or simply die, exhausted and used up. 




 Looks like you can buy it from iTunes or Amazon and get your money back. See http://recode.net/2014/03/15/warner-brothers-to-veronica-mars-backers-ok-ok-use-itunes-or-amazon-if-you-want/ 




 I was just going to say this as well. Sounded to good to be true.  




 I know this breaks rule 2   3, but you should read his story as it pertains to cancer and insurance.

It wasn't until a few weeks ago when the formal denial letter came through that the gravity of the situation really hit home: because I hadn't lied when I saw my first doctor -- because I'd told them that I'd had stomachaches at any point in the past five years, whether or not I'd gone to a doctor for it -- I'd fallen under a fine-print pre-existing condition clause that said that any signs of illness that could possibly have led a doctor to a diagnosis since 2008 were cause for denying any compensation for any ailment of pretty much my entire alimentary canal. 




 I purchased a Lenova IdeaCentre K330 ( see http://thetechjournal.com/electronics/computer/lenovo-k330b-77472bu-desktop.xhtml ) in the summer of 2011.

 I would gladly pay for H+ but I would want no adds at all.  




 50 mbps down and 10 mbps up for me. My promo rate is about to expire however. Time to call them soon for another one.  




 Something similar happened to me as well, and I had to spent an hour talking to a few different reps before the deal was honored. 




 As dumb as this sounds I've had this happen before. I had to call back and explain to them I have no internet, and they allowed it.

 Taken from this awesome comment @ http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1v48v3/supercomputer_takes_40_mins_to_calculate_a_single/ceom6lx 

 Very important correction - this is the original article and the computer simulated one percent of a human brain.

EDIT: As /r/terkala points out, if we follow Moore's Law out then we get to realtime in 24 years.

1 (percent of a brain)/2/4/8/16/32/64/128

Realtime simulation of a human brain in 2053, by a computer which is super-gigantic and consumes just under 10 MW. So to get this down to the size of a human brain, we'll need to keep pushing Moore's Law out.

The K Computer uses over 80,000 SPARC64 VIIIfx processors, so it's about 10,000 times the size of a human brain (leaving out the cooling systems and wiring and so forth).

10k/5k/2.5k/1.25k/312/156/78/39/19.5/10/5/2.5/1.25

SO: Viable android brain in 2080, if wild and dubious assumptions can be taken as fact.

Someone in HR god fired but they did not inform IT, well not at least till the next day, even then late in the day. :(

When this person went home after being fired in the morning they connected to Sharepoint and started to download all sorts of documents like payroll   salaries, contracts, expenses, bonuses, agreements, etc. and then proceeded to email them to everyone in the company. In no time everyone knew what everyone was making, how much they received for bonuses and raises, etc.

  The Columbine massacre was an event that would change lives across the United States, including Ledonne's. Within a few years of the shooting he would be at the center of a fierce media firestorm, demonized in the press by Columbine survivors, and the target of open abuse and death threats. While countless others publicly came to terms with the shooting by making films, books, plays or music, Ledonne dared to use a different medium: He made a video game.
 
 He made Super Columbine Massacre RPG!

 PIL - The order of death is my favorite track from the movie. Closing credits I think.  




 One of my favorite movies growing up. 




  The poison in question is temozolomide, a chemotherapy agent thats specifically used to treat brain tumors.  I once read the label, with its biohazard trefoil, and stopped when I saw the word cytotoxin.  That means cell poison; it attacks cells that are dividing, as cancer cells always are.  But it attacks all dividing cells, not just malignant ones.  A growing five-year-old has a lot of dividing cells, and we are poisoning them all.  We just hope that were poisoning the cancerous brain cells more than other cells.
