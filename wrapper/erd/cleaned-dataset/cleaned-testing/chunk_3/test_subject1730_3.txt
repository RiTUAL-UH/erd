 OH man. I think this was taken either Jungfrau or somewhere along the journey up to Jungfrau. All three (Jungfrau, Mnch and Eiger) are all part of the Bernese Alps. This photo was taken back in 2006 though, so I'm not exactly certain of the position that it was shot. 




 Curses! I have to work so no live stream for me :/

I'll write out the story in an email for you and Spacy for your show!

 True. But after serving with the USCG for more than a decade, there is a bit of love there :P 




 I know they're much smaller, but any chance of doing this with the aircraft of the US Coast Guard? 




 And now I need to go play Mass Effect 2....

Fantastic work though! 














 I can do that! When are you guys looking at recording this episode? 




 Gah! I used to live out there. My first real intro to ageplay with another person took place out there. I've got so many good memories of the area and want to go back so badly! 




 Thank you! 




 Awesome! I shall be waiting with baited breath :D 




 How long ago was this? 




 lol. Fair enough. Needless to say, I've loved the story and have read through it a few times! I can't wait to read what you put out next! Keep up the amazing work! 




 I don't suppose there's any plans for a sequel or another story set in the same setting (town, universe, which ever you prefer to call it) is there? 




 YES!!! I would love to see an adult pull up that isn't shit.  




 The small boat in question is a 64' SPC-SV (Special Purpose Craft - Screening Vessel). I am not sure of which sub was being escorted at that time. 









 While I agree, I don't think the USCG would be able to afford it. They can barely afford to upgrade their current fleet. And at one point, they had their ability to actually purchase new ships stripped from them by DHS! 




 I agree completely! Sadly, the Russians have a massive fleet of icebreakers. 

Edit: I was misinformed. 




 The CIWS has numerous delicate cards within it to help with targeting and what not. When the ship would get up to a good speed or even some up on the turbines, the entire ship would vibrate horribly. And those poor cards would shatter in their holders since the vibrations were horrible right above the screws. 




 The Seventh District (which covers South Carolina, Georgia and most of Florida) is one of the busiest districts if not the busiest. Miami and Key West tend to have a lot more cutters. And some of the smaller cutters (87', 110') are sometimes homeported in small towns.  




 I'll see if I can find some over the next few days :) 




 I've noticed that there are still a few cutters missing. Things like the USCGC Vise and the USCGC Joshua Appleby. I'll do some more digging when I get home. 




 There is a list! It's the [USCG Light List](http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=lightlists). It includes both federal (USCG Maintained) and private aids. 




 And each tender has a massive AOR! Not to mention that they will go help other tenders if needed.
