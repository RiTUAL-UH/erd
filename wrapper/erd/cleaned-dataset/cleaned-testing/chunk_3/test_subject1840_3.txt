 Let me quote: "In concentrations up to 1% (10,000 ppm), it will make some people feel drowsy.[84] Concentrations of 7% to 10% may cause suffocation, even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, manifesting as dizziness, headache, visual and hearing dysfunction, and unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour."

 You not afraid to fail? excellent and you have practical "feeling" - wonderful. Than I couldn't find a reason why you shouldn't succeeded.  You invest money and you have right to profits if you doing it wisely.
What is you idea about growing on your fields? 




 so, will you try breath with mix of 20% O2   80% CO2  ?  I don't think you can - rising level of CO2 in you lungs would trigger signal in your brain to make you fill out of breath  - if I not mistaken -  and level of CO2  would killed you.   




 Obviously, it's nothing to be shame about and finished looks really great. What I'm worried about is amount of working hours necessary to spend on it - if someone starting with this business - most important for him is time and money hi must spent on it.  
Having carpenter's and builder's experience I can  recommend to make walls a bit higher (if you want to have upper part of the house) and put the roof on rafters laying just on wooden beams fixed to the top of the highest and smallest walls.

So, good luck with module 2. 




 As I remember this guy wanted circa 10k$ for developing this technology - really small amount of money if such profitable industry. Big aluminum companies doesn't use it, that's mean to me building production line won't we easy or cheap and cost of product could be bigger than using imported boxites.
If you succeed with this technology you don't need to wary with the many for development others projects. 




 You forget about all this people with ill liver forbidden to drink fizzy drinks, dude  ;)

But I really appreciate your American sense of humor.
