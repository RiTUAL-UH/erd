 Drop either Nemeth, Ponitus, or Diaz. 




 Gerrad. Keane and Zardes can score from Gerrad's services more than Nemec and Villa from Lampard's services. 




 Soumare is better than Ciman cost wise. Soumare was one of the best point scorers on the Chicago Fire last year.  




 Yes. It is a factor, but it isn't a major factor of a "terrible economy". "terrible economy" has many many factors.  




 Because people use the "low participation rate" to justify that the economy is poor. You get that a lot from conservatives. It is one of the lingering factors of the recession as well as the aging American population, slower and slower recoveries, etc. Back in the 1950s, less than 60% of Americans were particapating in the labor force, yet the economy was still prosperous mostly due to fact that we won the war, but still.  




 That is such a bad way of thinking for maintaining and functioning a society.  




 The labor participation rate fell during the bush he's years as well. So bush's economy was also in crisis?  




 New England has a lot of Liverpool FC fans so..... 




 I mean... If the laws are bad after they are implemented, you vote politicians out or propose new ones. 




 Lol that sounds like an ad made by Tom Cotton on Obama adding food stamps to farm bills.  




 Hence why some oppose reforming the electoral college to majority rules or a proportional system. I wish we had a more proportional system. 




 It doesn't matter because Obama's presidency has been effective at getting us out of the recession. The GOP will probably rewrite history by claiming that doing nothing and mass control of local and state governments helped improve the economy instead of the federal government. 




 Actually if you talk to republicans, they say that doing nothing is good because it means no bad laws will be passed through Congress.  




 Yugo is by far the most intriguing and weird character so far. 




 Does anybody know if speedroids will be introduced into the game and which set? 




 Max Urruti was my fav for this season during the pre-season, since he trailed BWP in goals per 90 minutes last season, but he is on the bench. 

If I had to list potential candidates, it would be:

Blas Perez, Urruti, Altidore, and Rivero at the moment. Still too early in the season to call.

 




 any deck that can nuke the field is good in this format.  




 I know. people used to use Spell Canceller to side against Nekroz just a few weeks ago. lol 




 BATTERYMANS! 




 Really? I think Arc-V's story, plot, theme song, background music, presentation, and acting is better than Zexal's and 5d's.  




 Karakuri Watchdog mdl 313 "Saizan"? 









 Casual but I go to locals to see what the status and variety of yugioh community. I just can't play yugioh casually with friends or neighborhood people anymore because they either quit, don't have time, have other priorities, etc. 




 Any more? :| 




 Twister, Storm, Tornado, Wild Tornado, Artifact Ignition, Bait Doll, Night Beam, etc

Any more of those? 




 Yes, if MLS wanted to go over 32 team limit. They would have to create 2 leagues of 20 teams for a total of 40 teams.

 




 Don't transfer all 2 players for week 2 because Week 1 is usually random. I'll wait until week 2 to make a decision on what players need to be transfered out. Plus, you can have 3 transfers to mold your team in the future week.  




 I have feeling Royal Magical Library will soon be on the Ban List...soon... 




 Patroid - Look at 1 set card in the spell or trap zone that your opponent controls 




 Thanks! 




 Does Green mean favorable and Red mean unfavorable?  




 Dempsey 60%, but you can always go with Altidore 40% chance, since the few games of any season are unexpected.  




 He wasn't that great last season too. He is fast and all. I was hoping that he would at least grab an assist in Game 1 since Vancouver does have speedy forwards. He only got 1 point, which was the worst of my team's preformance, so I had to make a cut.  




 Yugo because he is so random. Declan is myserious but considered an anti-hero.  




 If Konami errated Vehicroid Connection Zone to "roid" type macine monsters, then Roids as an archtype would be good.  




 Roids.  




 I just transfered one player because 1st days are always unexpected. Eric Hurtado for Jose Villareal with some spare millions.  I just hope the ones that I got before Week 1 actually perform in Week 2. Otherwise, I will have 3 transfers to build up. 




 roids! 




 Att and Defense Combinations.

The attack points or defense points of 2 or more monsters must equal to a #. The combination of monsters will be sent to the banish instead of the graveyard. The new extra monsters' Attack and Defense are not considered attack and defense points but rather something else? When those monsters attack, they are not treated as attacking, but you can only attack once per a turn? 




 I think America needs to have a more transit oriented culture and infrastructure in order for public transit to be "privatized". 




 They are somewhat by releasing new support for archtypes.  




 True to a certain extent, but there is a point where Globalization inherently eliminates national soverignty and national cultures. 




 It is concerning but it is less concerning than the TPP.  




 ^ Basically 




 Sorry for the wrong usage of the word. Games with no significant influence on playoffs are just money makers.  




 New Ban Lists are now 1/4 of the year.  




 Konami wants Pendulum decks to dominate to market ARC-V.... so... not really.  




 Konami will not hit Qlis because Qlis are a good pendulum deck to market ARC-V. They might hit Rituals and Nekroz support a bit because they need more balance in the game. Though, I wouldn't count on that since the TCG just released support and don't want to lose $$$.

Konami will hit Dante, Burning Abyss support, and maybe Shadolls, so they can add a new archtype into the meta for tier 1.  




 not really. America will get jobs outsourced from Europe since European rules and regulations are stricter than American rules and regulations. TTIP is more of a concern for the EU. 




 I consider myself a Rockefeller Republican or a Populist Democrat, so it is hilarious to see GOP call out each other as RINOs. Democrats don't call out DINOs as much as Republicans do, but oh well. I wished we had more political parties though.  




 I love how Republicans call out moderates as "RINOs". Please continue :) 




 More meaningless games is just more revenues for the business of the teams.  




 Ya because 9 strikes to a strikeout was so traditional back in the 19th century. Baseball is not what used to be. 




 Also new rule changes have always occurred in baseball. 




 how will you balance the game so it is more fair but still favor new archtypes? 




 we have a 2 party system with representatives and senators. Germany has a multiparty system with a parliament like system. 




 torrential Tribute 




 Hyperspeedroid Dahma 




 do you live in a rural farm area in the middle of America? o.O 




 That could work, but that plan must be aided by an increase in the gas tax. I doubt people will want to take the MBTA over the car via the Masspike. An expansion like that will cause no significant increase in ridership because of various opportunity costs. The elasticity of car usage of people outside of Boston and ring highways is greater than the elasticity of public transit usage of city people within Boston. 




 The real solution is building safer pipelines, regulating oil trains properly, and decrease dependence on fossil fuels. 




 keystone will help to reduce some demand off of oil trains but companies will still need oil trains to ship oil for medium distances from oil pipelines. 




 pipelines are only a short term solution and they still have faults. they still leak and companies still need to ship oil via rail in medium distances from the pipelines. What needs to be done is build more pipelines, improve rail safety, pipeline regulation, and decrease dependence on fossil fuels. 




 Some people outside of MBTA service areas say that they don't want to pay for the MBTA's upgrades, expansions, etc because Why should they pay for something that they don't use?  




 I applaud MLB for decent changes for pace. 




 Not really. They are so expensive for the booster boxes. 




 Magician's Force of you can get it at a good value. 




 There are half spell and half monster cards. They are treated as spells in the pendulum zones and monsters in the monster zones. Each zone has a different effect for it. They have scales between 1 and 12. You can pendulum summon monsters with levels in between the the numbers of the scales. When pend monsters/spells are destoryed, they go to extra deck. You can pend summon again from extra deck.  




 I think Pendulums will help vanilla monsters out in yugioh. 




 I think that the people, who left Yugioh because of Pendulum Summoning, should just watch the anime. It is literally very dramatic and can easily top as one of the best Yugioh Series. 

" I love the ever growing game bit many old players just dont want to accept it. " - People said this for Fusion Summoing, Synchro Summoning, and XYZ Summoning.  




 I don't recommend Zexal. It is easily one of the worst Yugioh series.  




 I recommend 5Ds because the style of yugioh is similar to the current metagame. Also, the images are better than GX and the Original. The 5D's rock song is similar to GX's theme song. GX and Original Yugioh are also a good series to watch. I don't recommend Zexal, if you just got back. The presentation of Zexal is not great.  




 True. Sacramento Republic could relocate to San Francisco in the future, if they wanted to.  




 if you have access to public transit, then it does discourage driving. Otherwise, it is very inelastic for people, who don't have access. 




 If San Fran were to get a team, it would another in the bay area. California could realistically see 6 MLS teams.... but..... who knows... 




 Boston University here. Close enough lol 




 Boston University!! Anybody plays?  




 Actually, if you rank cities based on population of metro areas, Sacramento is 28th compared to San Diego which is 17th. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_and_Canadian_cities_by_number_of_major_professional_sports_franchises 




 A Sacramento MLS expansion would essentially prevent San Diego from getting an MLS team. I don't think MLS will have 2 LA teams, 2 SF Bay teams, 1 in Sacramento, and 1 in San Diego for a total of 6 teams of 1/5 of a 30 team league. 

 




 The 2 party system is terrible 




 Thanks! Ultra-Pros do load from the sides.  




 Are the Ultra-Pro 9 pocket sheets good for storage? The cards do have to enter from the sides. Does that effect how I need to handle the binder, if they fall out?

or 

Are the BCW 9 pocket sheets a better alternative because they store cards from the top rather than from the sides?

Thanks for the help. 




 A higher gas tax would have to be placed so the MBTA would get the riders that it needs 




 You can be a libertarian and still have moderate views. Nothing wrong, though transit can be public-private partnership at times. 




 Just keep in mind. A lot of conservatives, centre-right people, and Tea Party folks in Massachusetts have been calling for privatization and waste cutting during this snow crisis to fund the MBTA.  




 Recently, the T has had a lot of infrastructure problems from the storm, which caused a lot of people to complain about it. However, the real problem is a money and the lack of investment in the system for years. Would Privatizing it help? Should the T get more funding? Should the T cut waste? What should be done?  




 Baseball has more data and more variance spread out through more games to accurately measure than football, so baseball relatively easier to predict than football. 




 Ross Perot's voters were from both Republicans and Democrats. 

Perot's voters were anti-Reaganomics Conservatives, Rockefeller Republicans, Isolationist and Labor Democrats. 




 We need a proportional system for votes. 




 D: I am sad that Speedroids didn't come out in this set. At least we do get Clear Wing Synchro Dragon and other machine support of cybers. 




 Decoyroid, Ambulanceroid, Rescueroid, Cyber Summon Blaster OTK? 




 If you want to boost your skill level, you should help other players improve their game.  




 There are more spells and traps than monsters. 




 Get the Box early, if you know that you really want the cards for the archtype. Do note that after supply increases, the prices of single cards will drop until the demand, which is the metagame, favors Nekroz. Then, prices will start to increase faster than supply. If not, the prices will fall to its minimum.  




 Prices only drop in the beginning because the supply increased. The market doesn't know if the deck is competitive or not. However, if the deck does in fact do well, Demand will rise faster than Supply, so they get more expensive. 




 Box because there is a limited supply in the beginning, so singles will be expensive. Box allows you to get more of them for a better value.  




 Honestly, they will be on here just to look around, if they are bored or want to know what the fans are doing......
 




 Hello! I am just wondering because I have collected a lot of yugioh since the orginal yugioh. I have a lot of commons, a decent amount of rares, and some really good and/or staple cards. I might trade or sell some cards away to make some few dollars. 

What are some good binders to get based on value relative to price?  




 HAHA! I honestly hope they include Hungry Burger into that mix. 




 LOL. I wish yugioh made a food yugioh deck. remember the food monsters from GX and Arc-V? 




 Just joking lol 




 It is cheaper to buy the box, when the set intially comes out because you get more cards for the Nekroz deck and/or for other decks. Also, since there is a limited supply, when it comes out, the singles will cost abe worth a lot. Don't buy singles, when it intially comes out because the prices will decrease as the supply increases. Buy singles, if you know that market has hit its minimum value. Over time, if that particular deck does well against other decks, demand will rise faster than supply, which cause Singles to be high in value again. If that is the case, just the buy box. 




 Roids :) 




 Congrats!! 




 Exodia 




 You will make a profit, if you resell. :) 




 Well in Georgia, highways can have 8 lines of traffic on both sides. Lol 




 I feel like decks will have different varieties of spell/trap removal. This card works best in mill decks.
