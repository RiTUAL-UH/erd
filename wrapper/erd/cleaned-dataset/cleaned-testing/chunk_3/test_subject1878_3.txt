 That or as a single father he didn't want to go grocery shopping!  




 Lol stupid mobile imgur, this is not the one I meant to post... 





























 I know that this week I've seen a few gowns and hats in the NYC subway, and heard about a commencement speeches in NJ and Maryland, so there's three states. But others may have another couple of weeks, not sure. Which is why I called it "season"...  




 ...around now, thus the title of my post... 




 Oh my GLOB that is great! 




 It's not, exactly. 

Just the same pose, lighting and composition. 

I went to find a reference photo, but [shutterstock didn't quite understand](http://thumb7.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/65566/65566,1295799798,1/stock-photo-portrait-of-happy-senior-couple-with-colorful-bouquet-of-flowers-smiling-at-camera-69575149.jpg)... 


































 Right? Hundreds of texts, but nooOoOoOOo, we neeeever talked about the campaign stuff! We're just best buds!  



























































 Huh. Well then, I guess we *can* forget ~~those~~ ~~bastard~~ dolphins. 

Though... and not to trivialize actual rape...sexual coercion that traps and wears down a female's resistance does sound pretty rapey...date rape at least...

And here I was thinking the gif would be able to end things on a slightly lighter note! 




 Animals don't really rape (ducks one of the few exceptions)

 Haha no, by all means, I love me some dark humor! Just unexpected is all. And the NSFW tag/flair is just a joke to make it that much darker!  




 Kinda dark, eh? 

(Particularly with the flair I just gave it...Also NSFW tagged...)

 Yep. In the space of just a centuryish we've done what nature usually takes thousands and thousands of years to do!

 ...this is the only Shell story for at least 100 submissions... 




 Just make sure not to pay upfront! Many meowchanics will try to get a depawsit from you. But then they start feline the nip and will claw out all your car's wiring because it resembles their favorite prey in the wild, yarn.

 Crossing the line between [everyday villainry](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/19/the-truth-behind-peabodys-campaign-to-rebrand-coal-as-a-poverty-cure) and cartoonish super-villainry.  










































































 Longform piece exposing a concerted effort to deceive the public and exploit poverty to stall policy action that would damper massive profits. 

Discussion question: On a scale of Hilter to Nickleback, just how evil is it to do PR on the backs of the poor? 

What about when you factor in[ exploiting Ebola, as Peabody's also done?](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/19/peabody-energy-exploited-ebola-crisis-for-corporate-gain-say-health-experts)  




 Here because the energy poverty argument is one that's popular among climate deniers on reddit and elsewhere, and this is a helpful expose on its self-serving nature. 









 /r/catpeoplehate is literally worse than Kitler.  




 Their low self esteem generally being due to social pressure to meet unreasonable expectations, as this post clearly illustrates.  




 U wot m8? 




 Meh sticky posts only show up when you go to the subreddit, the fun here is when people see it in their regular feed.  




 I distinguish comments here whenever I remember to...It's my only real chance for mod abuse... 




 I'm not angry. Just so very disappointed...

 [Agreed!](http://imgur.com/fuHgOxy.gifv) 




 Hmmm, after consulting [with the Princess](http://i.imgur.com/Cez0El4.png) it seems you're right!

I thought that was an easy way to tell, but I guess I gotta look a little closer!  




 What makes you say that? I thought the big striped backpatchs were a male thing?  




 Paper says it's open access... http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/10/5/054007/

 Yes, like 10 other people have commented to that effect. You are not alone.  




 Point isn't exactly how long each step is. Point's that you can draw step lines all over the place, but that just distracts from the long-term warming trend.  




 The world came together, recognized the problem was human emissions, created a policy to deal with it, and have been reducing those emissions since. It's called the Montreal Protocol, and it's been one of the most successful environmental policies to date.  




 About a dozen different foundations of various sizes and sorts (none of which are clean energy industry dependent.) If you know the space you can probably guess a few of them, and wouldn't recognize the others if I told you.  




  if the previous studies were wrong why trust this one?

Because that's how science progresses.  




 Deniers and their political and media friends.  




 Christy's satellite work [had to be corrected](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/apr/11/climate-change-research-quality-imbalance) numerous times [over the years](http://i.guim.co.uk/static/w-620/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/10/1397092268511/UAH_Corrections.jpg), and he's always been a GOP favorite, so he's not exactly the most reliable source..
