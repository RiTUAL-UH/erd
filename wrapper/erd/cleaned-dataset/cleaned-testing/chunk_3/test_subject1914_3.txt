 come on man its only a bit of fun 




 cue all the opinions that are not controversial at all  




 i know what you mean mate. players getting sent off and costing you the cup or something then they get mad. its absolutely ridiculous  




 i'm just gonna be blunt if you haven't been spotted by now theres a very slim chance you will make it. keep putting in good performance's for your club and hope to get noticed by a scout. Australia's poor youth programme won't help but  chances are slim though best of luck though 




 3-2 extra time loss to man united in the fa cup final preventing me from winning the treble. 




 congratz man ! 




 he's a regen right back haha

 i know i know me being an arsenal fan it killed me so close to going unbeaten...fucking spurs  









 usually take of my striker for a cb. unless It's an important game and i need a win then i just risk it 




 nice i seem to find some good regens out of scotland never managed theore but it sounds interesting  




 Mate thats quite a story keep me informed ! 




 you have a squad that won the league by 11 points thats the squad you have. and 4 is generous 3 at best would get into those teams  




 Nice ! keep me updated :) 




 fuck I'm doing an arsenal save I'm not as successful 3 leagues 1 fa cup and two champions leagues  




 wow nice ! 




 keep me updated mate 




 we've all been there mate 




 FUCK ! what an acheivement. keep me updated would love to follow what happens.   




 let me hear about your current save. hows it going everyone ? 




 Have Fun first and for most :) 




 because germany takes all their players 




 nice who was you at the time ? 




 woah ! worth it ? 




 nice how many did he get ? 




 it happens to the best of us mate  




 haha bless :) 




 keep me posted on how he does ! 




 jeez deal of the decade ! 




 FUCK ! how did he only cost 28 mil  




 yeah when you make your team one of the richest in the world you can afford those luxury players  




 yeah i'm kind of similar sometimes you have to pay crazy money if he's a one of a kind player 









 when a player gets sent off costing you the title or costing you the cup. and then you fine them two weeks wages and then they complain.  YOU COST ME THE TITLE YOU FUCKING CUNT 
 




 good movie and i love how slevin dresses  




 don't talk shit  




 been there my friend. one time i lost so bad i couldn't sell any toothpaste  




 i just lost the fa cup final to a 120  minute  goal. tell me your most upsetting/gut wrenching games  




 will give it a go thanks for the advice pal :) 




 thanks ! any kind of striker it won't be great for. will it not be effective for big strong strikers  




 what does 'move into channels' mean because I'm not quite sure  




 haha oooo that would be fun 




 its going better on my arsenal save. i stormed the league in my first season and won the champions league (probably my proudest achievement) beating man united in the semis. however my second season was disaster made some wrong moves in the transfer window and ended up finishing 9th 
i got to the semis of the champions league the league cup and the fa cup all knocked out by man united ( I'm glad the old rivalry is back though) 
i somehow managed to keep my job and most of my important players. now I'm in my third season and I'm two points of top but I'm just targeting a top 4 finish.i have also had a lot of fun bringing my youth through dan crowley serge gnabry and a few others are now semi regulars. but yeah thats it at the moment  









 with aaron lennon in the team. holy shit  




 you responded by saying we won't know till there older which kind of goes without saying. 




 we obviously won't know until they are older that doesn't mean we are not allowed to talk about them 









 thanks for getting back to me think its gonna be an interesting read 




 wow that sounds very interesting if you do come across the quote give it a post !
