 Don't tell me thats a little Jack Russell. I have [TWO](http://i.imgur.com/d5H00OI.jpg) this brings tears to my eyes. You should do a painting or something and invest some time and make it awesome. 









 He looks very annoyed that he can't even make nachos without getting his picture taken. 









 yea but thats not all stencil work. Most of it I hand painted. Tedious work. I'm glad my friend took the picture because the wall was taken down a week later. But the photo lives on!

 Yes I agree, I thought you were already an artist that has done stencil work before. But for leaning purposes your right on when doing it is simply the best way to learn, so it doesn't matter the content. You can feel how the paint and stencil react to each other, thinness in your card-stock, many things that you don't even consider. In the end just do what works best for you. Just because someone might praise one way of doing things might not mean it works for what your doing. That applies with anything really. I didn't mean to come off harsh I just really hate when people take someone elses work, cut it out, then call it their own. Keep it up. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I like to help.

 Why don't you be creative and make your own art? This is a Banksy piece and its very well known. When people see it (if they know of Banksy) they are going to just think to themselves that someone has no creativity. Please do us a favor and not recreate other peoples art. Can you honestly not think of anything original?  









 I don't know why you had to waste your skills with a painting of fucking Miley Cyrus. She shouldn't have anything to do with art let alone BE art. And if you consider her an artist, you need to be euthanized immediately. 




 The wind ended up lifting the stencil up outside when I was painting it and lost its definition, and the more I tried to fix it the worse it was coming out. So then I was just like fuck it ill blindfold her. You can see her eyes so it doesn't make since but it kinda looks cool. [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/5LDXapC.jpg) is what I was going for.

 First we bought one plan at our local skate store but it was too expensive and too big. After looking everywhere online I stumbled onto this plan. It was so detailed and perfect for what we were looking to build. I couldn't tell you where to find it but it was perfect because it was just big enough and if I recall just under 500 dollars. But we had a bunch of left over plywood we stashed under the half pipe. So the best advise I can give is try to find something in your budget, have some friends help you, and get all the material before you start. And make sure that shits level. The surface is 2 layers. First plywood, then skate-light or something similar. Let me know if you have anymore questions.   




 I found a really great plan online. So we started saving some money but my grandma ended up paying for it as a x-mas gift. She also let us build it on her lawn. Shes a cool lady.
 









 Awesome pun sir

 Not as bad as you would think. Really fun for some high school kids in the dead of winter. 









 Holy monkey balls. 




 Man, your set. Even got the snickers handy. Smart man. 




 Thank you for that information. 




 Oh yea and about the strings, I was using my acoustic all day. Even tho I use Erni Ball acoustic Reg. I dont care who you are, after playing all day with heavy strings your gonna loose some skin. If I was playing my PRS, no problem, can play that shit all day. I took a shower after and the tips of my finger peeled off, but that happens to all of us. 




 Honestly man, if you can actually count how many songs you know then your not as experienced as you think you are. Ive been playing for 10+ years and I couldn't give a fuck how many songs I know. If your truly a fucking musician than you of all people should know thats its about having fun and making music. I don't know why your acting like douche but your ego is far bigger than your guitar skills my friend. Boom.  




 Man, I sincerely feel bad that this new generation won't grow up with old Disney movies and game boys. And those Disney movies were works of art, everything down to watercolor and sound effects. You know? 









 Dick^ 




 [Here](http://imgur.com/a/5xOuD) is some pics of us building the thing. 




 It deserves lots of love indeed. Man, the hours I spent on the school bus playing that. Remember how awesome and new it was to have a lighted screen? 




 Oh the irony... Kid makes a statement by smashing a PS4 yet just handed sony 600 dollars. good effort?   
 









 Where's the fun in that? Fuck long finger nails. If you can get those fuckers to bleed treat it like a trophy. Also acoustic guitars do way more damage. No offence. it doesn't matter how you play it its all about what you can produce. Take Hendrix for example, right handed guitar played left. 




 I have no idea why I found that so funny. but... just great. ahhhh 




 A wise man once said guitar is easy to learn but take's a lifetime to perfect.  









 So many questions... So fucking many.
 




 Thank you sir! This deserves more attention in this sub. 




 Haven't been able to find the video. It must exist because the pics are screenshots from a video. Maybe someone will find it
 




 Holy actual shit... 









 Let me let you in on a secret. Most religions (especially Christianity) are a scam... A fairy tail of heaven to make old people less scared and hell to scare young people into believing. This universe is infinite... having no beginning and no end. This means you are also infinite... Our bodies are like hermit crab shells that we shed after death. Have you ever wondered what the afterlife is like? It is a lot like being born. You don't remember because live is never ending and always finds a way. I figured this out over time and through wise people, and I wish I would have known this as a kid like you because once you realize this (and many other things you will come to learn) you will know true happiness. Life is love and we are all here experiencing ourselves. I have been in your shoes but let me tell you how lucky you really are. You are alive and you have a future believe it or not... and you live in a time and place that is a gem in our universe so take advantage of it and don't listen to these fucking church goers. Find something or someone you love and loose yourself in it and always remember you have an eternity to find piece and happiness and believe me son, you will. I hope this helps.
