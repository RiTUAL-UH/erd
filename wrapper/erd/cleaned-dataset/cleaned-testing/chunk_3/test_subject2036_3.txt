 Just read that you passed! Congratulations! :) Knew you could do it!  




 Since summertime last year, I have been feeling extremely anxious literally all the fucking time. The past 9 months or so have really been the toughest I've ever endured. I've felt more and more not like myself, constantly worrying and fearing everything. If one problem gets resolved, I'd just move on to something else to worry about. I always feel sorry for myself and imagine terrible things happening to me. 

Yesterday I cracked, finally. I just lay down on my bed and started crying. It felt so good to cry and just let it out because for the past 9 months or so I've literally felt like things are building up and I'm just gonna explode. 

This evening, I decided that I've had enough. I've simply had enough of anxiety and depression and all the other emotions I feel. It was pouring with rain and dark and I went outside and just did a workout session. I worked up a sweat and just got soaked and muddy. I have to say, in the past 9 months I've never felt so good as I do right now. It feels so empowering just to say "you know what, I don't care about what happens to me, I don't care if all my darkest and most horrible fears become real. I love myself and I'm going to just going to say fuck it, go outside and get dirty".

The funniest thing is, I always see reddit posts about doing excercise and how it changes your frame of mind and makes you feel better but I always just say "fuck it", It probably won't make a difference to me or make me feel worse. But I have to say, I just feel so alive. Now all I want in the whole world is just to keep this feeling going and gain momentum to get out of this rut that I'm in.

Anyways, I just wanted to get that off my chest. To all people who are like me and read posts about doing exercise but never actually do it, please just do it. Just do one honest, hard session. Get dirty and sore, muddy and wet, just do it! 

Thanks for reading! :) 




 You are an evil person.  




 Thanks so much for the response. Means a lot to me :) 




 Don't look at it like you need to pass and if you make one mistake you've failed. Look at it like you've already failed and you need to just drive well in order to pass. Don't concentrate on any mistakes you may  make. I thought I'd definitely failed mine but I persisted and it turned out I passed. No matter how bad a mistake, just imagine you've already failed right from the beginning and it relieves the pressure.  




 Although he was under for long we usually say around 15 minutes is the limit in an avalanche. This person was rescued relatively quickly.  




 I'm a 19 year old guy currently on my gap year (year break before college/university that we do in England). I've been travelling around quite a lot during my year off and I feel like my anxiety/depression is just getting worse. I never have panic attacks like I used to but I constantly just feel anxious. 

The big thing for me is my health. I am always worried about my health, primarily stds. Last year I did something stupid with a girl I didn't know and i literally convinced myself I had HIV. I went and got tested and I didn't have it which was a huge relief. But then at new year i got blackout drunk on a night out and lost some of my friends. Since then I have been worried that I have it again. For some reason I just feel like my drunk self is a total ass-hole who will completely fuck up my life given the chance. I have no reason to believe i got infected, I'm pretty sure i didn't have sex or anything but I just feel like I did something that made me get a disease. I've told myself that I will get tested again after 3 months but even if I come up negative again I don't think thats going to be the end of the problem.

I feel like I always have to have one thing that I'm worrying about. It used to be a brain tumour and then I got scans and after everything came out fine I would switch my anxiety and focus on something else. But there is never a time where I'm just not worried about anything. There is always one thing that I'm fretting over in my mind and it's usually a disease of some sort. 

I just feel so insane. I feel like nothing good will come of me and i will end up as a tragedy, dying young of a disease with stigma attached to it through my own fault.  I've never been to a doc or therapist about my anxiety/hypochondria but I'm starting to think I should. I mean, its nearly been 3 months since new years and I am still constantly worried about having ruined my life over being blackout drunk. That just can't be normal. I feel like I don't like my inner self who is revealed when I get really drunk with friends. I have no self control and I just feel ashamed of myself. The worst part is I didn't used to feel like this. I used to love myself and be proud of things I did, I used to be my friend but I just don't feel that way anymore. I honestly look in the mirror and see someone who I'm afraid and ashamed of when I look into my own eyes. I mean how fucked up is that?

Anyway, the reason I feel like I haven't talked to a doctor or therapist is 1: Because I'm always away and 2: Because I don't actually know If I'm having real issues. Some days the anxiety will still be there in my head but I will be distracted, I'll hang out with my friends and feel happy and I don't know if I truly need help or I just occasionally feel "Sad" because im a young teenager with hormones in me.

But every night I will go to bed and while lying there I will feel scared. Maybe of nothing in particular but just scared and filled with dread. 

Sorry for the rant I just feel I really need to talk about this. Any responses would mean the world to me.  




 A tragedy but all these people are good looking as fuck! 




 Whats the song? Is it from halo? 




 That was fucking cute. 




 Yeah true that. I only wrote "Ecstasy of Gold" in the title because I assumed people know thats Ennio Morricone.
