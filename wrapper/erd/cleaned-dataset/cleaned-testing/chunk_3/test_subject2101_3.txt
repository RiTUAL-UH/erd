 Sure. 




 For years I have come across references from various sources alluding to Adam being the second angel created by God.  [This can also be found in the evageeks wiki](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Adam#Allusions):

 *The second book of Enoch refers to Adam as the Second Angel. In NGE, Adam is the First Angel, and Lilith, not Adam, is the Second Angel. However, all humans descend from the Second Angel, whether Adam in Enoch, or Lilith in Evangelion.*

This has always annoyed me because its always been listed without a proper citation/reference.  So, I recently went on a hunt to find out what the real deal is about it, and found a [*Google Books source*](https://books.google.com/books?id=Wgk3AAAAMAAJ lpg=PA40 ots=XmQ3ouHfu3 dq=%22secrets%20of%20enoch%22%20%22second%20angel%22 pg=PA40#v=onepage q=%22secrets%20of%20enoch%22%20%22second%20angel%22 f=false) of the Book of Enoch scripture detailing God's creation of Adam:

 [11] And I placed him upon the earth like a second angel in an honourable great and glorious way

 [12] And I made him a ruler to rule upon the earth and to have My wisdom

I don't think any of this substantiates the book of Enoch/Adam/Lilith connection.

Thoughts? 




 and yet you are so sensitive about it.  have fun on the internet! 




 well, you're taking a light-hearted jab (an excuse to say *anta baka* on this sub) the wrong way.  But I would still say that best girl posts traditionally come with pics to share - promoting a pic swap which almost always ends in a posting of Ramiel as best girl.

 Not sure what you are saying here in contrast to what I said.  I said it wasn't a single shot.  I didnt say anything about it being chloe or not.  




 I find Time Warner to be the most cost-effective (I cant find a better deal) option for 20/2 mb service.  The service has been good, with only a handful of experienced late-night outages in the past couple of years.  Streaming and downloading has been consistent.

I'm sure others have their complaints, but over-all my experience has been good.  I quarterly check for better deals, and can never find one. 




 I think we still have plenty of our own specific deaths and issues to protest, before doing one specifically for Freddie Gray.  I think Baltimore has FG covered for now.  LA protesting something on the other side of the country is a distraction to protesting against our own numerous local problems. 




 I thought that the compass will direct *whoever is using it* to the direction of what they desire the most?  I'm pretty sure this is demonstrated across the movie franchise when other people are in possession of the compass.

Sorry I can't make any specific citations at this time, because its been a long time since I have watched any of them. 




 Good luck and be safe!

who the fuck starts a best girl thread without posting any pics of who they are saying is best girl?   thats what I'm fucking saying.

 Ee!  :-)  You posted a best girl question with no visual offering to the best girl gods. 




 Sooo many additional train routes used to exist all over the country.  You could shake your head for years reviewing all of the routes terminated and tracks ripped-up or covered. 




 AFAIK, its mostly because its non-standard equipment that needs to be rented and operated by a special op.

And yea, you also have the added time of setting up a shot multiple times in a choreographed manner.  I'm not sure what you mean by training beyond that. 




 its called motion tracking.  that was not a single-sequence.

edit: its so funny how blinded fans can be.  it was a fantastic sequence of action, but you're mistaken if you think it was a single shot - *sorry!* 




 Tracking shots are expensive. 




 I've waited for a fight scene like this for 2 years!  This is the kind of SHIELD infiltration action I have expected from the start.  I hope they keep it up! 




 And he beats his family daily.

 then it was just deleted, not a post from a shadow-banned user. 




 How can you have any pudding, if you don't eat your meat? 




 ... how do you know that someone commented and is shadow-banned?  By being shadow-banned, you shouldn't even know they tried to comment - no?

 He seriously did this, and constantly drove around without plates?  What an asshole. 




  I want you to get this fuck where he breathes! I want you to find this nancy-boy graffiti artist, I want him DEAD! I want his family DEAD! I want his house burned to the GROUND! I wanna go there in the middle of the night and I wanna PISS ON HIS ASHES!

 hindsight 20/20.  But when something potentially injuring you comes at you from one side, you instinctively go the other way.  from the roll of the vehicle, you can tell it was a hard yank on the steering.

 Nailed it, thank you. I completely drew a blank on the proper name/terminology for this issue.  




 And that doesn't come off as an end-user experience bug?  I mean, as a tech person, I knew how to work around it. How many non-tech people would, without any interface prompting or reminders? 




 **Example Problem:**  Custom sort order all Marvel Cinematic Universe titles like so:

|Title|Sort Title|
|:-|:-|
|Captain America: The First Avenger|Marvel 1|
|Iron Man|Marvel 4|
|Iron Man 2|Marvel 5|
|Thor|Marvel 7|
|The Incredible Hulk|Marvel 8|
|The Avengers|Marvel 10|
|Iron Man 3|Marvel 12|
|Thor 2|Marvel 15|
|Captain America: The Winter Soldier|Marvel 17|
|Guardians of the Galaxy|Marvel 19|

**Displayed order ends up being:**

1. Captain America: The First Avenger
1. The Avengers
1. Iron Man 3
1. Thor 2
1. Captain America: The Winter Soldier
1. Guardians of the Galaxy
1. Iron Man
1. Iron Man 2
1. Thor
1. The Incredible Hulk

**So, what's the problem?**  Plex is numerically ordering as 1, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 4, 5, 7, 8.  This is apparent in the raw movies order as well as any filtered displays such as collections.  Its numerically linking against the first number.

**Work-around:** Prefix any single-digit numbers with a 0, and Plex will display it in the correct numerical order.  So 1 as 01, 2 as 02, and so on...

 No worries.  The older I get, the more obscure my references are :-) 




 [It's a quote from Blazing Saddles](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071230/quotes?item=qt0564101), poking fun at the actress Hedy Lamarr.  [She was not pleased and pressed legal action against the production](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazing_Saddles#Production). 




  Is that why you're not giant?

 If you dont like hotlinks to clarifications of meaning, you're on the wrong fucking *world wide web*.

 Because proper understanding of word definitions are important, so incorrect assumption are not made. 

Yet apparently lots of people took needless offense to that. 

The proper definition illustrates that it has less to do with the person doing it, and more with the circumstance and context for which it was done.  




 he means that the "editors" dont do it, which is true.  its a vfx house thats doing it. 




 It's still the correct answer to OPs question. It has nothing to do with Bjork's intent.  




 Gosh, I hope all those youtube views were worth it. /s 




 Because it looked like something made at a craft fair. Completely inelegant for the occasion.  




 I don't have an issue with a critical opinion. It's what hear as a horrible inflection found in many bloggers who cannot seem to curb a condescending attitude that thy project when giving an opinion. It's an audible influence to give further sway that not only are what they are saying is correct, but you should feel dumb for not knowing it. 

It's something that you more often hear coming from teenagers. And not to sound sexist, but in my experience, teenage girls.  




 It looked [asinine](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/asinine).   




 That was a fascinating read.  Jesus ppl are dumb. 




 You see, the problem right there is that it blew out its "O" ring. 




 This is an interesting concept, but tracker lists aren't just about putting a blank line between listings.  Blank lines are meant to separate tracker *tiers*.

Tiers are groupings of tracker URLs that fall within the dominion of the same hostname address - in order of connection preference.

Example of how tiered-grouping works:

    udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce
    
    udp://open.demonii.com:6969/announce
    http://open.demonii.com:6969/announce
    udp://open.demonii.com:1337/announce
    http://open.demonii.com:1337/announce

 Its not the content or discussion I mind.  *Its the narration*.  I find the inflections used annoying and condensending.

 I seriously hope those people wore respirators. 




 I'm not sure I understand where this effort is going.  Having a directory map can be useful when you are organizing large amounts of files, but I don't see the value if this is for generating a download queue for re-downloading content.

imho this is making more required effort - not less.

I would be concentrating on organizing magnet or .torrent info, so that could be directly fed into a client like utorrent. 




 Lost Coast too. 




 This might be a more direct alternative for windows batch:

    FOR /F "tokens=*" %%I IN ('DIR /B /S "*.avi" "*.mp*" "*.mkv" 2^NUL') DO @ECHO %%~nI

This gives you file names without file extensions.

 it would be far easier to save the magnet links or convert them from your torrent files.

 I really love these.  Thank you for sharing!

This is the first time something has made me think that Toji's leg being missing was perhaps due to amputation from the angel infection - and not damage to the entry plug.

 with the editing that it has, its very likely a body double.  otherwise, they would use a panned shot to show you that *holy shit*, this is the lady you've been wanting to see get nekkid. 




 But the point of my comment really has to do with a style that focuses on striking.  You could also call most any Judo dojo full-contact. 




 Thanks! 




 Not on my Samsung TV they dont.  If the external subs are SRT, then I dont transcode.

edit: The crucial part of being able to avoid transcoding with subtitles is to be using a plex client that is capable of *overlaying* subtitles as opposed to *embedding* them into the video stream. 




 I have the strangest feeling someone is watching me. 




 Where is #6 located? 




 External subs are fantastic if you want to avoid transcoding. 




 Is this the blonde that was on Dr. Who?  




 Hot damn!  Seriously!? I havent read that in 20+ years...   thanks for the confirmation! 




 Who's on-looking in horror in panel #3?  My guess:

1. Absorbing Man
1. Doctor Octopus

 




 1.11 starts as a remake, with subtle differences that turn into greater and greater differences through 2.22.

***3.33 is completely different.***

edit: As /u/Kigarta points out [in another reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/comments/33788g/should_i_buy_evangelion_111_222_and_333/cqiahpm), you really should watch End Of Evangelion before starting the rebuilds.
