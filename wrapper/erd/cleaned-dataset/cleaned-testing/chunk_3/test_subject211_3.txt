 It never hurts too look. And maybe they left some subtle hints. 




 /u/weaslelord found something interesting over on /r/gaming. Here's a direct quote from his post.

Looks like for whatever reason the Dota site has a countdown built in to it. This is what the URL that the TF2 site is hitting: http://www.dota2.com/jsfeed/timeuntilpdt?time=17%20Jun%202014%2017:00:00[1] (at which point they then do stuff to update the countdown and such). No Team Defense of the Fortress 2 unfortunately. Not this time, anyway.

What he's saying is that the timer isn't contained on the TF2 site but is rather directed through the DOTA website. this indicates that this timer **MIGHT** (and stress the might) have something to do with DOTA as well as TF2.  




 No one knows. it could be HL3. it could be bread*.

*Most likely bread. 




 Nobody knoooowssss ooooooo. Seriously though I'm gonna try and dig into this things source and see if I can find any further info. 




 Half-life 2..... HATS!

 No he didn't 




 Yes he did. 









 Byeah.

 Perhaps by the pound. 




 Freedom. To me satan means freedom. freedom of expression, freedom of choice and freedom of god. Christianity and other religions might boast freedom but the only freedom they truly offer is freedom to comform. Satanism however offers true freedom and freedom is all i could ever want. 




 Imagine this happening to a man getting a vasectomy. But seriously dude. I'm so sorry that that happened to you and I hope you sued.  




 This is a great piece. reminds me a lot of the centaurs from fallout.

 Ask any questions you have about satanism and one of the mods will respond with an answer promptly. 




 500KB/S here..... I envy you. 




 Electricity for example was considered a very Satanic thing when it was first discovered and utilized.

 Okay, I'm not really aware of what the limitations are because I only have some base knowledge in HTML/CSS and python.

But wouldn't you only  have to change syntax's? 




 It must be a sign.... Hmm. seduce... I know! You must be able to seduce alyx in HL3! 




 It'd be nice to see this. But why only lua? you could release the game with only lua and start releasing additional packs. Wanna learn python? New DLC just came out!, Wanna learn C++? New DLC just came out!

You could release the game and afterwards make language packs which just change the programming language used to manipulate the world. 




 I cringed when I heard ooo-bisoft 




 Thank you. We try and work hard to make everything here high quality and respectful. 









 okay, let me re-phrase that. "This is quite possibly the most neutral karma count gilded comment I've ever seen."

 Has nobody thought of bender yet? I mean, he waited for 1000 years and was disappointed when someone brought him 'round. 




 No discussions between characters, in a plain white room, no need for food, water or sleep and they don't age, no forms of stimuli whatsoever outside of their own minds. Which one could wait the longest before giving up. 




 I recently found out that there are strikes in judo. Does anybody have any resources as to where I can learn strikes in judo? are there any dojo's near washington D.C that anyone knows of that teach's strikes? 




 Alright, can we just end the discussion here? It's obvious we'll keep going over why sacrifice is or isn't wrong ad infinitum.

The only reason the sidebar said what it said was to give an example. It wasn't saying Satanism *couldn't be about these things* but rather that hollywood often sensationalize's the activity's of your everyday satanist.

We could go on and on for years about how the sidebar is worded and whether or not it's dictating what satanism is or isn't about.

So let's just stop here and say we're both wrong in some respects and right in some respects. 




 thank you. this was very informative. 




 Changed the sidebar again. I'm starting to feel i've lost my integrity at this point.

As for the sacrifice. Why would satan want an animal dead? If he demanded sacrifices then he would be just as corrupt and evil as any other god. not only that but what could sacrificing say a goat possibly do for him? It'd serve no purpose and the goat would have died for no reason. not even to be eaten.

If you're an atheist and you sacrifice a goat then it's the same thing. All your doing is appeasing yourself and in the process you take a goats life. Hence, something I don't do myself but if you really feel like you have to go ahead. 




 If there's no sea then you can't base it off sea level. Is it from the core? 




 I took your advice and changed the bit on the sidebar (I didn't actually write the sidebar, /u/bb411114 did btw)

As for the bit about sacrifice, the reason I don't agree with sacrfice is because killing the animal serves no actual purpose. If you slaughter an animal to eat it at least you have a reason to kill it. Same thing with coats.

Now for sacrificing it to satan lets look at it in 2 ways. First let's start with the theistic ideology: Why would satan want you to kill an animal for him? There's nothing the animal dying actually does for him, also Satan is kind and caring. The animals are just as much his followers as you or I are. so why would he wish for them to die?

As for atheistic sacrificing. If you don't even believe in a higher power what's the point of killing an animal? to appease yourself?  if you're doing it simply to make yourself feel better then you might have seriously rethink some of your life decisions.

As for drinking blood. If both parties consent to it and agree that they wish to drink each other's blood then I see nothing wrong.
