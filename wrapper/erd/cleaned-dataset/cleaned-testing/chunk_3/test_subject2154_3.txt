 The Big East had a couple teams overseeded, yes. There is no way Dayton was making it to the 6 line. Best case scenario was a 7. 

I'm not saying Xavier deserves their 6 (they don't), I'm saying Dayton wasn't in play for the 6. 




 You should be stoked, it's the coolest thing ever. I went for the first time last year and I had sky-high expectations, and it shattered them 




 Which would be one of the greatest things of all time, cuz he'd have approximately 97 points 




 It's a lot of losses for a 6 seed. 




 Take it up with UCLA and Indiana, not the Big East 




 They're like the 6th best team in the region, maybe. 




 Enjoy the Madness! 




 Fair enough! You guys have a great team, I just think Kentucky is the worst possible matchup for you (lol, as if they aren't for everyone)

I loooove Jerian Grant, one of my favorite players. I have him taking you guys to the Elite 8, he's just so fun to watch 




 I like him better than Haws. Although Haws is obviously still awesome. 




 Depends how big the pool is. If it's 50 people, this is a great strategy. If you're playing against hundreds, you'll probably have to get almost everything right to win this way. 




 EWU's not terrible. You guys are just getting labeled as March underachievers, and are therefore a sexy upset pick. 




 I'd say you have to get insanely lucky and have nearly a perfect bracket, or pick someone other than Kentucky to win the national title and hope it goes down that way. 




 Notre Dame only plays one player who's above 6'5", and they have a short bench. It's gonna be really hard for them to beat Kentucky. 




 Haws is good, he's not the best guard in the country. Maybe top 10. 




 I've got Northern Iowa. The game is gonna turn on if Lousiville is able to get out and run, cuz they're not gonna have a good time in the halfcourt. 




 FWIW, WVU has said Staten and Browne are going to play. 




 This is my diciest pick. I have a hunch about Wofford, is all it really is. I think they'll be able to slow the game down and Arkansas will get frustrated. Arkansas has the talent of a top 10 team. The reason they aren't a top 10 team is because they struggle to put it together a lot of the time. If this game is close in the first half, I can see them starting to crack.

This is, admittedly, my least defensible pick. 




 They outscored the league by that much because the league was not very good this year, at all.

The wins were by an average of 24.6 points because they weren't playing good teams haha. The best win of them was Stanford, who just straight gave up in the second half. I get you're a Pac 12 fan, but Utah is vulnerable here. Could they win this game, then go beat Duke in the Sweet 16? Hell yeah, they're talented enough to. But they're slumping right now, and they're vulnerable. 




 Don't trust SDSU. Seen them play a couple times this year, don't think they can score enough. Obekpa being out does make it interesting, but I feel like St John's will win. But that's the beauty of the tournament, who the hell am I? 




 Duke has a significant size advantage with Okafor against you. 1 of 5 guys.

If you play Kentucky, they'll have a significant size advantage over you at all 5 positions. 




 And the 162nd ranked offense in terms of efficiency. It's not good enough to beat Duke unless Duke looks disinterested (which has happened a couple times this year).

It's not impossible, just unlikely 




 There's a certain amount of this here too:

http://dc243.4shared.com/img/0-YPtbQE/s7/13eee3b8430/introduce_a_little_anarchy 




 SF Austin has the best chance. Buffalo has a solid shot at pulling one, and are well-coached. Wofford is a veteran team that a lot of experts like, but the metrics hate. Wyoming has by far the hardest matchup; Northern Iowa is a better version of themselves. 




 I heard they lost them somewhere around Heartbreak City. 




 Idk about that. Bennett is a great coach. I think Michigan State will win, but saying Bennett isn't a good coach is just foolishness 




 Iowa State. 




 Yeah forgot to throw that in there hahaha. Would truly be a bold statement if I meant the field. 




 UNC also happened to put a couple of those close games in the win column, including victories over Virginia and Louisville in the past week. 




 A good point. Wofford is an incredibly low-tempo team, however, so 67 PPG is not bad in that regard. Call this one a hunch; I just have a feeling Arkansas will get flustered. They have a tendency to do that.

I do think Arkansas is a really good team, capable of doing damage. Just think Wofford will get em. 




 That's why I can't wait! Gonna be an awesome 3 weeks 




 You beat them at home. You have 4 road wins all year, the best of which is probably Northwestern. Purdue has a road win at Indiana and a neutral site win over BYU. They do have bad losses, but they happened awhile ago, when the team was still struggling to put it together. I think them being 1 seed line higher is totally justified. 




 Soooo....you split with them. Congrats? You have 1 top 50 win, they have 4. That's significant. 




 *in the region 




 Massively underrated in the way people are talking about them. I think they got the seed they deserved. And they were ahead of Wisconsin btw, they're only behind Kentucky. 




 Yes. You answered your own question. If you're the weakest 2 seed, then yes, I would like you as my 2. 




 Based on your resume, a 10 is pretty accurate. You guys have certainly looked better than that at times though. 




 The edge I think is Gonzaga's height. Otherwise they're actually pretty similar teams. But a lot of people don't believe in Gonzaga in March. 




 Notre Dame only has one rotation player above 6'5" (Zach Auguste), and he struggles with foul trouble. 




 If Justin Jackson shoots 4/5 from three like he did against Virginia, UNC can beat anyone in the field. Anyone. That performance blew my mind. 




 To me, it's either this or SFA/EWU that has the most likely 12/13 second-round matchup. 




 Not even a little bit. I'd wager that most people are picking Texas, and 8/9 games are a coin flip, statistically. 




 For the record, I like you guys in this match-up. My post was just meant to be a couple quick-hitters about why people think they could do it.

Devin Williams is a bad man, and underrated as shit. 




 Losing Obekpa is big, but SDSU just cannot score. Like at all. Hard for me to pick them over the Johnnies, even without Obekpa. 




  They may not have had the resume to deserve their tourney bid, but they have the talent to win some games.

This is exactly how I feel about UCLA haha. The annoying thing about it is that when they win a game or two, the story will be about how everyone doubted them. No. No one doubts your talent. We just think you didn't earn your spot. 




 Oh absolutely. That's why these two are 8 and 9 and not, say, in the mix for a top 4 seed. 




 Good luck! Enjoy the Madness :) 




 Thanks! I love me some college hoops haha, and I follow it all year. This is like Christmas for me.

Oh I love Arkansas, also just have a gut feeling about Wofford haha. I also think they have a tendency to get a little out of control, and that can hurt them if they find the game close and Wofford hits some shots.

I'd probably have taken Cincy over any other 8/9 seed, but Purdue is playing well right now, and I think Cincy is realllly gonna struggle to score. But they've had a fantastic year given everything they've gone through. 




 Buffalo takes care of the ball well, gave Kentucky a decent game, and plays with pace. They are well-coached, and have a legit star in Justin Moss. They're not scintillating offensively, but they're not bad at anything. 




 I'm rooting for it too! The world needs more Tyler Harvey.

Utah is slumping, and SFA is an incredible team. SFA is probably the most popular 12 over a 5 pick, and for good reason. SFA went to OT with Northern Iowa earlier in the year, and Northern Iowa is a team a lot of people think can make the Final Four. Utah has lost 4 of 7 coming into the tournament, and hasn't looked that good doing it. Delon Wright is really good for the Utes, but personally, I think we're gonna see Stephen F Austin take it.
 




 Not without rebounding extraordinarily well for a team their size. Gonna be incredibly difficult, and they really have no answer for Towns inside. If they shoot it well, they might. Otherwise, nope. 




 8/9 winners: Purdue, Oregon, LSU, St John's

5/12 winners: West Virginia, Wofford, Northern Iowa, Stephen F Austin

Wichita State. Indiana is trending downward and Wichita reeeeally wants the Kansas game.

UNC. Paige is finally starting to play well again. Meeks is getting healthy. If Justin Jackson can keep shooting the ball well, they're a threat to get to Indianapolis.

BYU if they win, Xavier if Ole Miss wins. Xavier is the most overseeded team in the field, and BYU is really good, and playing great ball right now.

Ohio State can win a game, but I'd be amazed if they beat Arizona in the Round of 32.

Davidson could make the second weekend if they catch Gonzaga on an off night, but it's hard to picture them beating Iowa State. That being said, the way they shoot the three, it's not impossible.

I think UCLA will get SMU. Norman Powell is really good, UCLA takes care of the ball, and SMU is turnover-prone. If UCLA stays out of foul trouble, they could do it.

This is the best Gonzaga team in a while. NDSU is good, but man will they have to have the game of their lives to pull this off, especially given the Zags size. That being said, a 15 seed beat a 2 seed just a few years ago by having the game of their lives (Norfolk State over Missouri).

Michigan State. They're peaking at the right time and Izzo knows his way around this month. Georgia isn't to be taken lightly, but the Spartans should be favored.

Providence, Dayton, and OU are all legit teams. Dayton will be playing at home. OU probably has the best team. Providence will have the best player in any game. All three are very well-coached. This is one of the best pods in the first two rounds. I have Providence, but none of these three is wrong (and hell, Albany might get OU in the first round)

I have Nova. They're really really strong. Northern Iowa is also awesome, and a veteran group to boot. Louisville would be dicey. They're not playing that well right now. The 8/9 winner will have a decent shot at getting Villanova, but to me, Jay Wright will coach circles around Johnny Jones or (EDIT: Mark Gottfried, not Steve Lavin. Silly me). Not to mention they're really really good.
 




 Villanova is massively underrated IMO. That being said, I also think they got the hardest 8/9 draw of the 1 seeds. LSU and NC State both have the talent to beat anyone in the tournament. 




 EWU over Georgetown is tempting. EWU has the number 1 scorer in the country in Tyler Harvey, and shoot the 3 well, which is a great formula for an upset. Georgetown is a team a lot of people see as overseeded, and they have a psychological hurdle to overcome in proving that they won't be undone by a low seed in the first weekend yet again.

That being said, EWU doesn't play a lick of defense and Georgetown's offense is actually pretty good. So it depends how likely you think EWU is to get hot and outscore Georgetown. It's definitely not the most ridiculous upset pick, and it might be the most likely 13 over a 4. 




 4 percentage points? Are we gonna call that significant? 




 Best one of these for me was UConn winning it all in 2011. 




 Talent-wise and matchup-wise, they're probably the most equipped to beat Kentucky.

But Rick Barnes. 




 I'm hoping so bad for that SFA/Duke game. I think Duke would win but I think it would be amazing 




 Arizona has completely changed my mind in the past few weeks. They've looked really really good 




 SDSU to the Elite 8 is crazier than any of those haha. 




 Kentucky/Notre Dame
Wisconsin/Arizona
Villanova/Providence
Duke/Gonzaga 




 Not totally fair to say. Washington had their best player on the team still at that point (Upshaw), and were well on course to make the tournament with him on the team. 




 Why the Providence hate? Team is good. 




 Iowa is a 7, Iowa State is a 3. They can't play til the Sweet 16. 




 For what it's worth, that's also why Kansas keeps getting really high seeds. The committee rewards difficult schedules. 




 60 minutes? Damn that sure seems like asking a lot. 




 Texas isn't a bad loss, even right now.. 




 Yesss, I read Walden before I read Into the Wild, and I feel exactly the same way about it. Thoreau had some amazing truths to tell 




 No, no no no, no no no no no.

Seriously there's absolutely zero chance Kentucky isn't the number 1 overall seed unless the whole team gets declared ineligible. 




 It's just Duke/UVA is a matchup between two 1 seeds that went toe to toe the first time they played and Duke/UNC is the most popular matchup possible in any college game for ESPN. They just really don't want you to make it. 




 Reason being that you're the only team in the semis that would not create a delicious final for TV 




 That's wrong tho. You don't have to be stationary.

EDIT: These rules apply to a secondary defender. A primary defender can be giving ground and still draw a charge. 




 Into the Wild is a fascinating read. People got more than a little caught up in deciding who was right about Chris McCandless, but it's a fantastic story. 




 We were not all that far away from a Michigan-Penn State semifinal. Great effort by both teams, but the better teams won.

And man did DJ Newbill break my heart at the end. What a player. 




 This is EXACTLY how I've felt for the past year. Thanks for everything you do Mark. This, this right here? Made me cry. 




 Hammons has a smooth stroke at the line for a big 




 DON'T GOT NO TEAM CUZ MY SCHOOL IS SHITTY EVEN FOR D2 I JUST LOVE COLLEGE HOOPS CUZ I GREW UP WATCHING 




 Only thing in that sequence I thought was out of the ordinary was the quick timeout awarded. Everything else seemed fair to me. 




 Jeeeeeez eat your heart out La Salle. March is amazing but it can be brutal 




 Game was won and lost on those 50/50 balls down the stretch. Wisconsin got them and turned empty trips into points every time.

That said, Michigan played a hell of a game 




 Everyone always throws out hiring full-time officials. Yes, that would be ideal. It's also far easier to do for 30 teams, who can play a maximum of 15 games a night (which never happens), than it is to do for 351 teams in D1. Logistically that is a million times more difficult than a 30 team league like the NBA. 




 Every year we get at least one great dancing players GIF from college hoops. Who are the front runners this year, and who can surprise us in the tournament and take the title? 




 Holy shit I clicked on that and looked at the other scores from the day in the box above..Texas was still ranked 11. 




 They were better for 36 minutes of the game. Team is a combination of snakebit and Rick Barnes'd. 




 It's cuz he was about to say Longhorns lol 




 HEY UNC

MARCUS PAIGE'S BAGGY ASS UNIFORM MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE A GIRLFRIEND WHO SPENT THE NIGHT AND BORROWED YOUR CLOTHES 




 Really? You hung tough with an underrated team that you don't match up well with without your best player and you're mad?

Damn. 




 Man I love Devin Williams. Keep your head up Devin, you're gonna be a big part of next weekend for your team. 




 Jumala's saying these are counterexamples of "finishing sentence[s]" sucking. As in these last lines are all quite good. 




 Just the way the teams are playing right now, Indiana would likely be a much easier matchup. 




 You should be much more worried about BYU than Indiana haha 




 This is exactly how I feel.

"Well if I have one game on TV, one game on my laptop, and one game on my phone.." 




 I too love The Brothers Karamazov! Keep reading the Russians.
