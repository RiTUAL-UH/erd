 Wow this is amazing even better since you're not a gamer. Oh one thing tho, we never say neckbeard, that's a le reddit thing. 




 Toxic masculinity. A harmful effect of the evil patriarchy that denotes men as being violent, sexually aggressive, unemotional and so forth. Once again if you had bothered to read my post where i clearly pointed out this view of men is a concept not deriving from masculinity, the evurrrrrrrl patriarchy or men at all. It is a belief held by those feminist who would seek to eradicate the masculine gender role along with all gender roles in other-words it's from the great tumblrina crowd, or for you to better understand it's a made up stereotype which in reality is not factual or relevant to real life issues in concerns to masculinity. 

So now that i have explained that to you, is their anything else you would like to know since you clearly cannot think outside of the usual rhetoric you have heard. 




 Weird. Whenever someone finds the need to explain their ridicule and derision with more then one post it's usually because they have a hard-on and a need to be right. You seem to misunderstand simple concepts, i did not describe toxic masculinity because their is no such thing. I stated clearly not everyone fits into the masculine role and not every lil boy should or will grow up into such a role. You believe i am contradicting myself, so let me clear this up, the masculine identity is one you're free to choose or not choose.

Your concept of masculinity like your argument is a throwback, you believe that their is a omnipresent cultural pressure to force a boy into a gender identity and this masculine ideal. You believe the only way to stop this "masculinity" is to emasculate all those who choose willingly to embrace masculinity, maybe not you directly but those with similar opinions. In other-words you're doing a scorch earth policy when in reality all you need is a scalpel.

The only way masculinity as you believe can be toxic is if masculinity becomes a set ideal or benchmark, in while in the past in certain societies you would be correct, their was a definite ideal of what well defined masculinity entail but like time itself things change, what you consider toxic someone else considers the norm and what they consider the norm i find weird. This is where our world view departs, instead of seeking to better understand the different meaning of masculinity and what makes a man masculine you're seeking to rid the world all together due to a prejudice view of a stereotyped concept because you believe this will somehow free young boys and give them the ability to have even more choices when in reality you're essentially limiting the choices of all the boys who would prefer to simply grab the action figure or play cowboys in Indians because you're afraid that this will once again become the standard or norm.

But now i'm rambling. To wrap this up. Masculine like feminine is a diverse concept both heavily stigmatized and stereotyped, we're living in a new age where women are able to redefine what feminine means beyond the idea of a gentle sexual being who is emotional. Which is i know what you would classify as a "toxic" femininity because it's the stereotype, but my point of view is that instead of trying to destroy these "toxic" beliefs or ideals in one fell swoop we should learn from, encourage them so we can truly understand what feminine and masculine is, so we can begin to understand the complexities of these concepts. Now i probably did not explain this perfectly in you will probably reply i'm right at the edge but i fail to to see what lies beyond but you're also failing to see my simple point which is that some people are not willing or do not wish to see the complexity in femininity or masculinity they are stuck on the stereotypical view in which to destroy it all together. 
 




 You reply with meme's. Le reddit intelligentsia i see.

Listen:

1. Reread my post
2. Reread my post
4. Reread my post.
5. I did not skip 3
6. I did not add a period to 4, 4 is not real.
7. Then please reread my post again, get a friend to help you and then you might understand remotely what i stated because it's pretty clear. I never said that would be an issue, i was stating the eventual decline of white men like everything else is inevitable, so saying persecution could never occur is hyperbole.  




 Masculinity is toxic. How is that not persecution, not all men are manly men with rippling muscles and gravely voice, i don't think anyone is stating they're or this ideal should be forced on all little boys growing up but the idea that masculinity is toxic is an attack on men and a effort to dis-empower us. I don't call femininity toxic, i believe we should support both of them as a way to progress. Only way to provide equality, trying to stop a boy from being a boy is just as wrong as putting a woman into a predetermined and inferior role. Same concept, why would you want that for anyone. 

Also while i agree this is a mans world, we run this and always will for the foreseeable future. If you look at certain countries in europe who are trying to remove gender specific pronouns like he and she, force little boys to sit down and pee instead of standing are taking things too far. The idea that men will rule indefinately is utter crap, no empire last forever, if 20 years ago you had told me a black man would be leading the worlds only remaining super power i would have laughed for hours. But it occured and he was elected twice thanks in part heavily by white people, in 50 years white men will be a minority, latino's will probably outnumber white non latino's and we're becoming more progressive. 

So what happens to all the conservative christian white males? they die or become marginalized. I'm not saying this justify mens right's but if you don't think it's possible that theirs some element of men out there that are or will be prosecuted you're being willfully blind. I'm not white, christian or conservative but i can see why MRA/MGTOW exist granted i don't really consider them as viable organizations, they're good at pissing off feminist and trolling which is always a nice way to spend your time. 




 Actually dumbass. That's the definition of free speech, what free speech does not protect you from is consequences of your free speech. By that i mean it only relates to the government censorship. But you can say fuck you, you're a piece of shit faggot to the world and besides being ostracized publicly nobody can really do anything to you. 




 True but who hasn't hit it and quit it with keira already? post level 20 glyphs are impossible to find plus she probably sells them at 2,000 like the other skingy bastard merchants.  




 Wait the beached whale? 




 Really? point em out for me. I got my greater red so I could careless but for my second playthrough a good drowner spot would be a lifesaver.  




 Thanks.In i plan on starting a diet with my mom who's around 290 But what about my penis doc? that's the one thing i'm really concerned about. Are my symptoms common of uti after effects or what? 




 You should do a ama. The way you described why you have this side project/hobby was awesome. I kind of thought you were a dbag at first but now i get it.  




 This is for consoles. We struggling out here.  




 Not a spoiler.  









 Oh my bad ha i figured it out after i read it again. 

Also while i don't disagree with you entirely on realistic armor depictions. But this idea of the medieval plate armor being the standard for armored protection is not factual or realistic, armor came in many different forms and styles, the armor ciri is wearing in the first picture is actually viable. While the idea of boob armor is literally retarded because it directs the blade towards your chest center which is a weak point ciri's armor in the first picture with a little adjustment could direct the blade away, just flatten out the main metal chest piece  so a blade hitting it would slide off remember blades are cutting tools, you can't pierce plate i doubt it would even cause any kind of internal bleeding unless he were to use a bludgeon type weapon or a sword hilt http://www.radpour.com/images/stories/sassanian_persian_archer.jpg

 So spent hours trying to find a bloody glyph salesman to sell me some greater glyphs. On my last leg, i decide to say what the hell, fast travel to the alchemist around novigrad, to the north east in the woods, in the graveyard/crematorium the guy who is a wizard in hiding. Turns out the bastard is a magical alchemist ha, in other-words if you back out and go to the "show me what you got screen" or exit from the conversation entirely he switches his inventory from runes to glyphs and vice versa once you get back to his inventory screen. You might have to do it twice or 3 times to get to the greater glyphs but he has them. Best part he sells all the greater runes/glyphs for under 1,000 dollars. In effect making it much cheaper to buy glyphs/runes then crafting them which it already was even if they sold for 2,000 orens. Also fun fact you can dismantle swords/armor and keep the single glyph/rune or if you have witcher gear or swords(your glyph and runes will upgrade with them) 




 Am i the only one who realizes that most of the dlc outfits are post witcher 3 storyline related in concept? 




 So explain to me realistically how chain-mail boob armor protects ciri? 




 No that's chainmail not fishnets.

 The current iranian government only goes back to 79 idiot.  




 It's not a fact at all. Stating israel was the one who included iran into the axis of evil is hyperbole.  




 To all my fellow redditors. Iran=/= government, iran= good people who actually hate government. Only people who support government are former revolutionaries turncoats(those who agree with the theocracy) and islamist who crushed the secular revolution. 




 You do realize that it's not the media forcing the ayatollah to say death to america and israel correct? those are what they state at their rallies. Btw the iranian people are good people but they like israel hate their government. Get it now? see sunni good muslims, but isis bastards? 




 This is actually so true. It's a shame that not many people  know this but Iranians and the Israeli's along with the kurds are the 3 most secular/progressive/humanitarians groups in the region especially compared to the arab regimes. Yes i'm a zionist shill but i also support the iranian people, i looked up their history with israel and the zionist movement and it actually goes back to 1948, the president of iran "mossadegh" actually recognized Israel's existence and was one of the first countries in the world to do so and the first country in the middle-east. 

He was later overthrown due to not nationalizing Iranian oil by the cia, but israel's relationship continued heavily under the shah. Cutting the ayatollah pr campaign crap about how much he loves the Jew's, a uprising amount of ordinary Iranian's actually do care ofr the people of Israel and vice versa. Furthermore it seems this goes back centuries, in the 6th century when the persian sassanid empire was reclaiming territory lost to the eastern roman empire they made confederation with the jews living in israel in exchange for them helping the jews recover their homeland from the byzantines and fight alongside the sassanid empire. 

Theirs a long and common bond between them, the iranian youth is well educated and could care less about religious extremism. The 79 revolution was more socialist/communist/anarchist in origin then anything close to islamic. The islamist however just with the arab spring took over and crushed all secular revolutionary groups. Theirs a great animated film about a young girl and her journey as  woman through post revolution iran, forgot the name but it's a great watch and read. Theirs another story from a jewish womans perspective also if you want to see how jews withered the islamist takeover.

Anyway i support the iranian people, i've always felt if iran were to remove the ayatollah, give up territory to the kurds and make peace with israel they could collectively be a force to reckoned with if they ever allied. 




 A few months back i had a UTI, had a bleeding on the inside(tip of ) my penis when i woke up one morning and pissed, right after pissing i saw blood dripping. Went to the ER, got it cleared up, i later found out i had a UTI, got medicine for that, but my penis still feels... well weird, like it's dry and sticky whenever i attempt to masturbate. I feel pains down there, i have pains on the lower part of my adbomen around my groin, my butt feels tender and in pain also.

 Lmao you have yorick brown, the height of emasculated bitch boy comic book characters.  




 I can see why you chose hawkeye as your flair. When did comic books become the new staging ground for emasculated men to white knight causes on the basis of feminist rhetoric? Jesus being a bitch boy to feminist will never get you laid..... ever... not now, not back in grade school and not in the future. 

OP's post was sensible compared to your diatribe.  









 Found the conservative! 




 Hey check your privilege. Don't slut shame her because she is a sexually empowered strong beautiful woman who likes to spend her recreational time being a cum dumpster, you misogynist pig!

 Question why is it whenever it comes to politics southerners immediately spout off how they're the greatest patriots this country has ever seen, how much they love america, how they hate anyone who doesn't love america unconditionally. But then immediately go on about how they have a right to recognize and protect their "heritage" concerning a flag that represented the biggest treachery in us history and a heritage of nothing but traitors. How can you claim to love america but support those who attempted to destroy it by splitting the union? 




 Vietnam was an american war. The only people who would hate that would be Vietnam and even they don't hate our soldiers and there are no hard feelings concerning the war or it's effects. I mean theirs a mcdonalds ho chi minh city now, japan was justified nuclear attack that no one will ever apologize for. Your analogy does not work.  




 True. Live and let live.
