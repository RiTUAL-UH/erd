 can you interpret the situation?

and

I may be a bit out of perspective so ask me questions as well to uncover if I may be deluded or if there is something I can do to solve my problem here? 




 Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.....

 WHOA DUDE I "AM" the universe whoa 




 I say it a lot because I have so much on my mind that I forget some things I was thinking about and spend ages trying to remember them. This morning my goal was to wake up at 6:30 it was very important but I got up at 9 because in my head I was saying to myself, I'm trying to remember something it's like my brain has habitually used that as a rationalization tool because it's so uncomfortable getting out of bed,

 hmm 




 pc 









 are you his doctor 




 Proceeds to lower it towards pants 









 I have a feeling that he was some what elitist, kindness and compassion were not what he was about but i'm not really sure i have to read more and more to really get a better idea 




 please elaborate? 




 My plan is to minimise light and avoid artificial light after sunset, go to bed at 9pm and stay in darkness for 2 hours then fall asleep at 11pm and wake up at 6:30am thus when I get up it's not during a sleep cycle. In the morning I will expose myself to sunlight and throughout the day I will try and get a lot of sunlight while avoiding artificial light.  









 help 









 very intelligent, aced primary school anxiety started at puberty and it's severe, ruined highschool grades got below average so damn disappointed with what happened everything else is going shitty, grades, friends, relationships tried meds, counselling, doctors, sleep schedules, natural lighting, better eating, improvement and improvement of exercise ah fucking hell 




 Before going to sleep i literally feel on the edge if i touch my penis it might cum.

So how can i avoid a wet dream because i feel like orgasms make my super powers go away.
Maybe something along the lines of

1. realize you are in a sexual dream


2. stop and focus on something else


3. try and wake up and focus on something else 




  It was super gross, and he would always do this creepy giggle when he did it.

damn i read that as jingle

now that's fucked up haha 




 He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you.
"Beyond Good and Evil", Aphorism 146 (1886) Nietzsche

 




 - after research realise it's best to sleep on back or side

- wake up with sore throat, dry bitter disgusting taste, sick feeling in stomach and feeling shitty every morning discouraging me to drink water in the morning

- told it's because you sleep on your back which opens your mouth and encourages snoring

what do? 




 wait i mean dekeritanize - whatever it means to make it less cracked and dry and more smooth, glossy and normal shaped 




 i wear it while asleep, what is the solution? my goal is to keritanize the glans and restore sensitivity to the frenulum, i'll PM you links to my situation since it was a dorsal slit and those are slightly different 




 lightly wrapped 









  Buddhism is just another form of escapism

I've been reading a lot of nietzsche and nietzsche seems to be focused on the life affirming, endure through suffering type lifestyle while buddhism seems like an unconvincing idea of escapism, quick fixes, harmony or bliss.

Some would argue and say that buddhism is about wisdom and a peace mind, a peace mind will lead to better coping with life but i doubt that a peace mind is exclusive to buddhism i think learning to live with life as it is much like how nietzsche describes will leave you better off in the long run. 




 He seems to be focused on escaping reality and living in some type of artificial bliss. I would say an opposite perspective would be that of Nietzsche, a life affirming idea where people acknowledge the reality they life in no matter how unpleasant and try to live with it, try to adapt to it and overcome it, rather than escaping with your meditation, your lsd or ecstacy or even your quick fixes like instant bliss. One should get up off their ass take life by the fucking neck and be the master and not the slave. 




 That one comes across my mind every now and then and gets me awake for about 20 minutes then it's back to a miserable existence.

another one that makes me feel great and powerful

"I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not - that one endures." -nietzsche 




  I don't think they could have invaded the west coast. Midway would not have been the first big battle, Hawaii would have. From there it would have gone on much as it did, but at a later date. Lets say everything was delayed by a year, that we had not reduced them as much to ruins by the time the atomic bomb came into play. We had Tinian a year before we dropped the bomb- they would have been dropped on Japan on the same day as it already happened, and the war would have soon ended.
It may be that this would have drawn more of our resources from the European theater, in which case the Soviets would have ended up with more of Europe at the end. They could have beat Germany by themselves, assuming that lend-lease went on the same in the new history. 









 Help instead of a full erection, penis head opens i used to get hard ons that were very strong and my penis would be 8 inches long now instead of a full erection the penis head opens as if something is holding everything back and i only get 6 inches long help!

You: ok if you have a boner and you feel horny a few things you can do to help yourself have self control

You: make sure you are not hungry tired moody or thirsty

You: so hydrate yourself

You: use muscles a bit so that the blood goes from your penis elsewhere

You: a horny flaccid penis doesn't do much

You: and finally will power, consciously one can control everything they do, they just rationalize actions and some of them become automatic, so focus and try and control yourself, a burning monk during a protest didn't move a muscle or make a sound that's how much self control he had

You: so just remember your prefrontal cortex makes the decisions

You: the limbic system gives suggestions

You: you got anything to add to that plan?

You: how do you deal with those situations

You: rather than waiting it out specifically how do you take conscious control?

You: in detail

Stranger: well usually when I get erect I try to focus on other things or preoccupy myself, or if I start stroking my penis I'll force myself to put my hands at my sides. Also sometimes if I'm very horny and can't help it I'll play with my testicles, but not orgasm.

You: i try to re-wire my neurons, so if I am horny I would intuitively tell myself find a girl then

You: so eventually if you get really horny you will be good with women because you are so hungry for it

You: so every time you get horny ask, "how can I plan things so that I can increase my chances of finding women?

You: and if you happen to be around them and you are not feeling horny then you can say to yourself again intuitively -you had a chance-



You: the body will eventually re-wire itself to the real stuff

You: that goes for fetishes as well treat fetishes as you would treat horny urges

Stranger: good idea!

Stranger: it's just tough because I have a big cock too

 Hows edging, fantasy, online pics or vids going for you? 




 Guys I am broadcasting this from inside the moon, 

**QUICK ASK ME ALL YOUR QUESTIONS BEFORE THEY FIND OUT I AM A TRAITOR** 




   If you hold back orgasms the cum will just return to your bladder and will leave anyways when you pee.

whoa wait, can you back that up with a source?
 




 Interesting observation that only orgasm makes me lose super powers

edging doesn't

sex does

handjobs or blowjobs from a girl does  




 Conveys the idea of man leaving behind supernatural concepts and other forms of delusion and escapism for a rational assertive judgement. 




 Why didn't you do the *pretend is half asleep and pulls up pants unconsciously and moves slightly away and covers himself*

you didn't mention that option you rationalizing denial animal you  lol... 




 They are the only two options 

and how does it make you feel, the ability to have sex forever is it a turn on?

So the rule goes

Have sex

Ejaculate with orgasm

Loop

(You don't get used to it or it doesn't get boring because time is repeated so the brain doesn't numb, so basically it's the best sexual experience that could ever exist going on forever)

 I was a bit worried that i might develop some bad thinking habits with this though or i might rewire it to think unnaturally with the natural flow of thoughts being undermined 




 My attempt is to try low stimulation activities, these include staring at a wall and doing nothing, walking while doing nothing or reading a book like nietzsche, our lives are full of overly stimulating activities like music, movies, games, porn the idea is to challenge the brain to live with normal to low stimulation, the brain should get "hungry" for stimulation and also your creative side will wake up even more. The mechanics for one activity goes:

Walk

thought enters head

time is precious, is this thought even worth thinking about, this thought is probably a rationalization or weakness is it?

next thought comes in "an urge to play a game", is there a good reason to play that game? no

another thought "is this worth precious human seconds?" probably not

eventually the boredom will fuel the brain for neuroplasticity and creativity for self improvement
thoughts guys? 




 alright thanks 




 yeah ok

 How did you guys first get the idea for minecraft 




 That's how they did the apple commercial 









 In my case i'll have to disagree i feel like it's a placebo, my focus hasn't changed nothing has improved 




 one must be completely be life affirming no matter how bad it gets, it's a test of your character and spirit 




 Are you ever naked outside? what is it like?

So our genitals are never exposed to direct sunlight it feels good when it does no wonder our hormones are unbalanced thoughts on this? 




 who can invade russia? genghis can 




 jesus, the origin of anarchism 




 the idea in the movie "the man who never was"  




 All the hardest, coldest people you meet were once as soft as water. And thats the tragedy of living. "-unknown 




 This question is profound as it brings things back into perspective, you will be nonexistent forever after this so how much time do you have left to truly live life, to have a great life to the point where you would be glad if it repeated itself,  find some great things to be doing 




 only short term because of sensitivity 




 Every time you get an erection in your underwear, the tight underwear restricts blood flow causing the brain to stop encouraging an erection and do the reverse, make it flaccid again. Over time this becomes habitual to the point where erections are less inclined to happen because they only go about 50% or never reach their peak

thoughts? 




  judge) to intentionally arouse yourself, it's good.
 Raises the question of sperm donation however.
i don't get that^
 




 If i would sit alone i would think non stop for hours

 help 














 I wake up I try to get somewhere I try to make things better but I really feel like I am going no where, I read nietzsche i try to get a better understanding of life but wow that perpetual non existence after we die makes me want to do something now but it looks like i can't 




 My throat hurts every morning and I feel a sick feeling when i drink water  in the first 5 seconds but it does help in the long term 









 yeah nietzsche was brilliant, care to elaborate? 




 He was playing twisted metal 2 














 day 8  and i have 0 libido i feel asexual this is my 30th attempt at no fap and my first time getting to 8 days (i've tried for months) day 2 i was horny but all the other days of this reboot i have had 0 libido wtf should i be horny on day 7 and 8 because of testosterone? 




 Yeah sort of like, 

- ok here i am doing nothing
- organisms adapt to their environment
- so if i stay here and do nothing and it feels painfully boring it means i am adapting to what is natural

overstimulation comes with a host of other problems as well
