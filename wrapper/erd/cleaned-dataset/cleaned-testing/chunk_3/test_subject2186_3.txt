 It could definitely (and probably does) cause auditory hearing loss because their ears work very much like ours.  The sonar mechanism is a little more tricky.  I'm on mobile now and like I said earlier, I'm feeling particularly tired/lazy so I'm going to try to explain what I can remember about it (which isn't much).  Small cetaceans have an organ on the top of their head called a melon.  I can't recall what's in it, but it's either fluid-filled or fatty and it's highly malleable.  They use it to alter the high frequency sound waves they emit, which bounce off objects in the water.  They receive the returning waves through ~~hollows~~ special sound conducting tissues in their lower jaw, ~~which is either gas-filled or fluid-filled~~, and this amplifies it for them.  ~~I'm not sure off the top of my head if the sonar waves go from the jaw to the ears or if they have another avenue to the brain, but I'll definitely look it up when I get a chance in the next day or so.~~  The sound waves then travel to the inner ear.

So the loud music probably wouldn't damage the melon or jawbone to produce and receive the sonar, but it could affect the inner ear, which is used for auditory hearing as well ~~I'm not sure about the sonar processing pathway.  If it's the ears then it would, but I have a feeling it's not~~.  Echolocation seems to not be as important as auditory hearing though, which I was surprised to learn.  It seems even less important for captive cetaceans, since their environment never changes and is pretty free of obstacles. They probably learn quickly how to avoid running into the walls or bottom at night if it's too dark too see and don't need to use sonar much after that.

EDIT: [NOAA link](http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/cetaceans/cetaceaechol.php) that has good info! 




 Unfortunately, there's been a recent fad of having EDM concerts (or firework shows) at zoos and aquaria.  It's really bad for marine mammals in particular, because of their physiology and the construction of the pools that they are kept in.  Small cetaceans, such as dolphins, in particular have extremely sensitive hearing, so much so that they can even hunt fish solely through auditory sound, as opposed to using sight or echolocation (referenced in [this paper](http://www.econscience.org/val/pubs/orca_refs/barrett-lennard+96.pdf)).  The concrete tanks that cetaceans are kept in also act like giant satellite dishes, amplifying and reverberating any sound waves that enter the tanks (best link I could find is a [heavily anti-captivity blog](http://www.freewebs.com/let_toki_go_free/dolphinswim.htm), but this seems like common sense that bare walls cause echoes).  Also, sounds are naturally amplified by water ([Yahoo answers is the best source I can find quickly](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100517162204AAyO0TC), but again, it's common sense that the more dense a fluid, the more concentrated by sound).  Combine all these facts, and you have a terrible situation to be in if you're a cetacean.  It's also awful when you have people feed them things that they shouldn't eat.  Allegedly, captive dolphins are quick to eat just about anything, which could be a stereotypical behavior caused by the lack of stimulus in a captive environment or because they are kept hungry in order to get them to interact with zoo patrons.  I've read stories about people feeding captive dolphins paper, coins, and even lit cigarettes.  This is why I dislike people.

EDIT1: I can try to find links to supporting data later if anyone is interested.  It'd be more about the first half of what I said than the last half (since it's not like zoos and aquaria will let outside researchers study their animals to for the negative impacts captivity has on them).  Although I could find links for the second half, it would all be anecdotal.  It's late at night so I'm far to tired/lazy to do it now.

EDIT2: Links added.  Bonus [link](http://cetaceaninspiration.tumblr.com/post/33537138326/cetacean-hearing-music-in-shows-does-not-hurt) of a good Tumblr debate on the issue of noises affecting captive cetaceans.

TL;DR: Marine mammal captivity sucks. 









 After a hiatus and eventual retooling, Search the City is back and releasing a new album in about 3 weeks.  Much different sound than the previous line up (new singer, drummer, and bassist) but still great! 









 Yeah, if I had to get mauled by a mystery beast, I'd prefer to be completely covered at the time.  




 I think I would stop midstream if that happened to me.  Do you know if it ever tried to attack anyone? 




 Your sister does a great thing!  I'm glad that you and your sister have been able to help him so much.  I've only ever had small pets like fish and mice, but I'm readying a book on the study of animal personalities and it's made me think about many other animals, and mammals in particular, have sets of behaviors that can be as complex and unique as humans.  Those stories you shared were very heartwarming :) 




 I've seen dogs like him before but I don't know what the breed is called.  He's a great looking dog, though! 




 I've heard stories about camel spiders and such, but some unknown beast lurking around sounds much worse! 




 Awh :(  Hopefully the little guy headed back home after he saw you weren't able to give him any more attention! 




 That's really cool, actually!  Dogs seem to respond to high-stress situations much better than people do
