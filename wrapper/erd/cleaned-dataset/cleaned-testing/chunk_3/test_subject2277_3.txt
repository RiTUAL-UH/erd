 If you walk in public, you have no expectation of privacy.

 




 In Canada,( where I live) the courts have ruled there is no expectation of privacy in our yards.

Else your neighbor would get arrested for looking into your backyard.

I don't believe cops jerking off in helicopters is a reasonable concern.

To answer your question, you have zero expectation of privacy on city streets. 




 Probably because she kicked him and then he threw her to the ground, which is self defense.

Was it excessive force?  Possibly.  I believe he could have accomplished a similar end result ( her being on the ground) with less force and her face not hitting the ground.

Assault?  I say no, cause she kicked him and he defended himself. 




 I admit that I'm left a bit taken aback at how positively dreadful some people are online and how they always seem to find each other, so that they can tear people down collectively.

I've been online since 94 and the viciousness has been gradual.

 




 No.

Parents no longer have a parental duty when a child turns 16.

Youth bureau can help, but child services...no. 




 16 is the age you can be kicked out on your own.

 




 You don't suppose there may be an entirely different explanation as to why the 17 year old was booted out? 




 Do you have an expectation of privacy in public?  




 He wasn't sued.

This is criminal court.

 




 It's in the story.

The Fraser Institute. 




 You seem to spend a lot of time on /r/drugs.

I'm a recovering alcoholic and when I was drinking, my main focus was on getting loaded.

Once I got myself clean and sober, I was able to focus my energies on the actual things in my life that mattered and clearly see the big picture.

I also saved a lot of money getting clean, quit smoking too, which also saved me some money.

I wish you well.

 




 I was specifically talking about solicitors.  I'll listen to kids / students or other legitimate members of my neighbourhood.

 




 It has not expired.  You literally just made up your comment about big bad pharma keeping Viagra pricey.

'Pfizer's patent protecting Viagra from generic competition expires in April 2020, but Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. will be allowed to launch its generic version in the United States on Dec. 11, 2017.' 









 Don't ask to see ID.

Just say 'NO thanks' and close the door.  **Never engage door to door solicitors**

My strategy has worked for going on 16 years as a home owner
