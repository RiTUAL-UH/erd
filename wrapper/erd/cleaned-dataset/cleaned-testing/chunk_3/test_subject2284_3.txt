 Sorry, It's just that joker fish plot was recycled from the 70's/80's comics. 




 Yeah, this batman story from the 70's showcases how harmless the joker is! How about the time he cut off his own face, then killed 100's of people to try to get to batman, then tortured alfred and convinced the bat family that he cut off their face? What a jolly jape that was! 




 I have never seen magical girl series before madoka, hell, the only other anime I watched at the time was kill la kill and AOT. However, I would say to truly enjoy it you have to already be into narrative structure and storytelling, rather than just watching things for action sequences. I would also say it's not really an anime to recommend to kids or dumb people.  




 So robocop: the series? 




 It's a 50/50 thing everywhere. Even critics either gave 5 stars on 2 stars. 




 Kill la kill was also my first anime (other than claymore for some reason) and I found it to be massively flawed and overhyped, especially compared to Madoka magica. 




 If you're looking for stuff this season,  also look at akuma no riddle. Similar Yuri action to kill la kill. 




 I think the majority of people just use the washing machine/line to dry clothes. Space is at too much of a premium in Britain to have separate tumble dryers. 




 Man, What a poser, doesn't even use Ketchup lube on his bacon wank. 




 Fuck me, I forgot all about that, sorry, haven't been using the ol' ham radio for a while. However, I am deeply skeptical about that Napoleon stuff, Napoleon grew up in Australia, and  Australia was sunk by the whore of Nazareth 22 years ago. Therefore, Napoleon cannot know about the bullshit, as Austalia still hasn't invented Democracy.  




 Not really, Big breakout stuff is seen by Americans, like Shaun of the dead, but the majority of the great british films regularly released  (and by that I mean once every 3 months) are small products that wouldn't interest Yanks or regular british people anyway. 




 Brit here, never heard of a washing machine OUTSIDE a kitchen. 




 TBH I also believe that the moon landings took place on mars, but the Surface was painted to look black and white with Martian Bullshit, the most supple,nutritious  and effective of all the shit. 




 Edgar Wright-Shaun of the dead, although his arguable first directing Gig was the TV show spaced, which showed tremendous film making talent as well. 




 Probably professional assassin. She's essentially the most powerful being on Earth now. Can she even age? 




 Not necessarily a purely Mikasa focused series, but a more ensemble focused series. When Erin becomes a titan other cast members can't really act effectively, whereas 3DMG people can move between and help each other out. 




 This.  Erin having superpowers massively undermines Mikasa's character development in that episode, and she could have become a really decent protagonist. However, Erins superpowers make the show all about a flat, static character who the audience just isn't interested in 




 I view as more of a Faustian tragedy than a deconstruction.  




 I, Unlike most people, think the ending didn't really tie up all the loose ends, such as Rei and stuff. I think an elite 4 spin-off would be a really fun watch. 




 The Madoka OP is perfect for the underlying show: It's a saccharine glitzy pink opener, but the more you watch it (pre episode 10) the  more you start to see that it's actually depressing. My favourite detail is the montage of Madoka's comic hijinks, whist in the bottom left Chibi!Madoka gets more and more depressed, with Kyubey abandoning her in the end. It perfectly demonstrates how much grief being the comic relief would cause you. 




 Don't sweat it, I already did a much larger comment reply or r/anime:


I started watching it pretty much immediately after Kill la kill, and it doesn't hold up well in a character department. The characters in Kill la kill (and Madoka magica, which I watched after getting bored of AOT) are magnetic, genuinely entertaining characters, whereas I only really cared about Misaka in AOT, because she's way more interesting than the protagonist. I also found the battle of Trost to be ridiculously overdrawn, full of filler, and poorly paced within it's own arc and the general series (Erin fights, and nearly defeats, the colossal Titan in the first episode of the arc with barely any fanfare, the political intrigue, and royal guard/expedition force stuff should have been well before the battle of Trost)
I also feel that AOT is really unable to provoke 'the feels' in me, because I've seen the 'Mother dies in front of protagonist's eyes' trope so many times in comicbooks, as well as Mikasa's backstory and charactrer being similar to Claymore backstories. (the only other anime I ever watched) I also really didn't feel threatened by the Titans, as the 3D manouvre gear made every character spider man (Very little is shown to make it seem like the gear is ineffective other than dialogue, such as an apparent 1/5th of forces dying during a simple distraction detail)


I don't however, think it's terrible, and it is a good show. I'm just baffled why it's the show everyone tries to convince non-anime people like me to see, when Madoka magica is IMO a masterpiece. 




 Whilst I value your sense of social justice,the term Ladyboy is used to refer to a subculture, and, as far as I'm aware, isn't campaigned against by members of that subculture. 




 Watching AOT now, and I have to say, compared to my other two most recently watched animes, kill la kill and Madoka magica, it's quite hideously overrated IMO. 




 I don't know, the thing is, we have NO context for that shot, both in-universe and outside it. It could be one animator who decided to add it, it could have been the majority consensus to put it in. It is also a fairly blatant bit of fanservice/pandering and in my opinion, was a massive mistake. 




 I was mainly talking about how the Makogoori ship essentially implies that the entire series was about Gamagoori working up the courage to ask Mako out. I think the main reason people think Makogoori 'won' is that after the episode premiered, that ship was **dead** without that ONE PANEL in the credits (which I would also points out, means that we never get to find out what the E4 did after the events of the show) Ryumako would pretty much undoubtedly be canon (other arguments would be called heteronormativity to a much greater extent than the current norm) so when people found that image, many on the second viewing, Makogoori 'rose from the ashes.' People started making comics, and the rest is history. 




 I just find it weird how there's so much fanart of Mako/gamagoori that necessitates Mako acting out of character to work properly. The only character that Mako has had any interest in ever has been Ryuko, who is, contrary to popular belief, the main character of the story. I don't think Makogoori is unwarranted, but it is far from canon.   




 The dismal Jesters, Imagine a more adult version of the yogpod. 




 Ryumako, because apparently it's TOTALLY NOT CANON GAMAMAKO FOREVER GUYZ\???!!!! 




 So one of my favorite movies of all time is Scott pilgrim vs The world, I personally think it was another Directorial masterpiece from Edgar Wright. It was also highly critically acclaimed. However, whenever I ask anyone about it in my School,be it jocks, nerds, whoever, they all unanimously hate it. (and, surprisingly, have seen it) So I ask of you, what film do you, and the general fanbase love but everyone you ask about it seem to hate? 




 I think AOT is actually more disconcerting than Madoka magica, at least for me, as Madoka magica is a deconstruction of the surrealism associated with the Anime Genre, whereas AOT relishes that same Anime Surrealism. Madoka magica is also  better written, at least from my perspective

However, my perspective may well be unusual, as I was already a massive hipster/nerd, with a full knowledge of tv tropes. I would also like to say that from a perspective of ignorance, AOT is definitely a more appealing show to males. 




 I started watching it pretty much immediately after Kill la kill, and it doesn't hold up well in a character department. The characters in Kill la kill (and Madoka magica, which I watched after getting bored of AOT) are *magnetic,* genuinely entertaining characters, whereas I only really cared about Misaka in AOT, because she's way more interesting than the protagonist. I also found the battle of Trost to be ridiculously overdrawn, full of filler, and poorly paced within it's own arc and the general series (Erin fights, and nearly defeats, the colossal Titan in the first episode of the arc with barely any fanfare, the political intrigue, and royal guard/expedition force stuff should have been well before the battle of Trost)

 The first 3 episodes of attack on titan are probably the best of the first half of the season. After that it's essentially one massive drawn out battle. 




 Don't forget Makogoori shipping that necessitates Mako acting out of character!  




 But it's also mentioned that the escalation of Kaiju threat made nukes massively inefficient, hence the creation of the jeagers. I can see why you didn't like the movie, but that's really not a plot hole.  




 It explains in the movie that they tried to Nuke the rift but it didn't work, hence why the main plot of the movie is to Nuke the rift from the inside. 




 There still doing videos of the alpha on winterkewls page. 




 For the first few seconds I actually thought this was another look at yogventures. 




 Ragyo being an evil rita repulsa style character is one of the reasons I find Nui, Satsuki and arguably Rei, to be better antagonists. Those characters felt like they had actual intentions motivations and personalities other than being over the top evil. 




 Nah, episode 9's already fucking broken me, and I mean, legitimately broken me, I've been depressed for days. 




 In the 90's, but now he's been thoroughly replaced by Deadpool/Iron man, which is why it baffles me Fox is yet to make a deadpool movie. Tv tropes actually has a page about it [here] (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity) 




 The thing with Scott pilgrims ending is that the ending to the comic hadn't been written yet, and a lot of the context to the comics ending comes from the 5th and 6th books, which were not available during the movies production stages. The ending to the film was also meant to have scott end up with Knives instead, but it didn't test well. 




 Yeah, that sort of thing, as I've mentioned in previous threads as well, Inamuta has no real compulsion to be Satsuki's lackey other than power, and now that's gone, I thought you could add some cool character conflicts.  




 Just wondering, because people are building up the competition between it and black bullet. 




 essentially, if there was a season 2, I would personally like it to be more character based, as there's a **lot** of potential for personal conflicts after the series end, but that's just me. 




 I don't think a S2/sequel movie is that difficult to write for, particularly with the large number of loose ends left by the end of S1. I'm not saying it's a definite, but unless the OVA is extremely dense with material, you could potentially really easily find interesting angles for more content. That said, Senketsu is definitely dead. 




 Why not Akuma no riddle? That's in this season and has themes from kill la kill doesn't it? 




 It would be really cool for her to turn up like this in season 2, and completely in character. Nui could just turn up as a school girl, acting innocent, and Ryuko would be essentially powerless to act, would provide great drama. 




 I started watching attack on titan and finishing some promotional ideas for my own webcomic. However, AOT left me frustrated (It doesn't have the same emotional resonance for me as for others, I get no feels, I also don't like Eren as a character) so I started watching Madoka, and I think it's an astonishingly good series. 




 Holy shit! I just finished watching Madoka magica today (but not rebellion, no spoilers) it was a freakin' masterpiece! 




 Satsuki is genuinely a fascist, and is planning to take over the world, aware that with the life fibres gone, nudist beach is the only military left. 




 Pretty much, way more overpowered than superman. Wonder woman is also a better fighter than superman, and has a whip that compels people to tell the truth. Green lantern is also arguably more powerful, as he can construct any of his minds desires, and can ask for help from the green lantern corps, GL also knocked out **batman** in one punch. Batman has also been shown to consistently kick supermans ass. 




 Actually, In the Justice league comics, Superman is genuinely one of the weakest links on the team, any supervillain who outstrips superman in strength (and they all do, even lex luthor in his battle armor) will knock superman around for most of the fight. A MUCH bigger problem for the movies is the flash, who is ridiculously overpowered in a team setting. 




 Wasn't it THEN explained that it DEFINITELY WASN'T a doombot? Like, specifically by the editors? 




 TBH she doesn't break the marvel universe as much as people think, because the sentry is essentially squirrel girl played straight. You really could just explain away her powers as her being a reincarnation of the sentry/phoenix force.  




 I would totally watch a great lake avengers movie. 




 So Duncan, who the majority of people think did significantly better than zoey and Hannah, will get -14 points? seems a little harsh. 




 To be fair, if you want to be *really* specific the latest series revealed that he doesn't have Schizophrenia or split personalities, and his mind is actually trying to reconcile the interpretations of an alien consciousness, which mankind has viewed as the Ancient Egyptian God, Khonshu

**Comics are weird** 




 He has a new series out now, so it's a great jumping on point. 




 Makes me really want a moon knight movie. Moon Knight is essentially a combination of Rorscach and batman with added schizophrenia, plus, he exists in the marvel universe, so he once imagined Spider-man, wolverine and captain America were his split personalities. 




 All anime is also based of western culture after WW2, so technically this is a American take on the japanese take on the american take on the japanese take on Sci FI and martial arts. 




 KLK is set in a dystopia, but it's never explored, which would be an interesting direction for season 2. 




 Copied from my comment on a previous thread:

Season 2 would focus around a spec ops's style team, composed of Satsuki, Tsumugu, Uzu, Inamuta and nonon, trying to dismantle Revocs, which is now under the control of Rei, who is attempting to bring about the return of the live fibres (Sorry to Gamagoori fans, but if he was in the series people would focus way too heavily on his character, and, due to the season finale, we know there's no danger to him, also, the season would become about Mako/gamagoori shipping again) Ryuko and Mako don't appear, leaving their lives ambiguous. The show would be scaled down from kill la kill, having more grounded action and more characterization, as the life fibers have been destroyed, (comic relief is kept up by bickering, as is the hectic animation) therefore, the series focuses on Tsumugu and Satsuki making elaborate, batman esque plans, and having them usually horribly fail due to bickering and infighting, however, there are clear character arcs and motivations that the characters can undergo, further expanding and elaborating on the core series:


*Satsuki has to reconcile her current life as the 'good guy' with the fact that she was essentially a fascist dictator, and killed innocent people to create a gambit that didn't work


*Tsumugu finds out more about his sister, his reasons for joining nudist beach, and his relationship with his allies, who he has been trained to hate.


*Inamuta becomes generally more developed, taking a more active role in the narrative. He also has the most neutral backstory, since he never really swore the loyalty the other had for Satsuki. He may turn heel.


*Nonon has to deal with her spoiled, rich girl attitude in relation to the others selflessness, she also potentially has feeling for another team member


*Uzu has to deal with his self inflicted social isolation from the other team members, as well as essentially being 
the dumb muscle. Can possibly have a quest for a rematch against Ryuko.


*In general, the series could do lots of world building, particularly around what cause the world of Kill la Kill to get as screwed up as it is. Furthermore, halfway through the series, Nui turns up alive, meaning the team has to deal with who would essentially be the most powerful being on the planet as regular humans. Alternatively, Nui turns face, meaning the rest of the team has to deal with their suspicion of her.
I genuinely think a series all about badass normal pragmatism would be really cool, but maybe that's just me. 




 The demoman grenade launcher has 6 barrels because they originally intended for it to fir 6 shots per clip, a better example would be the soldier not having a finished reload animation for most rocket launchers, and just slapping the barrel instead. 




 Dwarf fortress. It's the most complex city builder an you know it. It was also popular in the other threads. 




 Welcome to the world of unexplained plot threads left hanging for a possible next season! 




 See Ryumako shippers! It's totally, indisputably  canon now, as is Guts/Mako's mom 




 Didn't Lewis win the livestream games because Duncan made the same spaceship part twice by accident? 




 UZU/RYUKO SHIP MILDLY VALIDATED! 




 My favorite episode. (or at least my most fondly remembered) Contrary to popular opinion, I think this episode does the most to establish the world of Kill la kill, a brutal, oppressive and violent social class system. It's almost a shame that the show later on removed most of the fascist, apocalyptic stuff in favor of straighter Good vs evil fights. 




 Man, I feel weird having found the second game pretty easy. Oh well. 




 But then it would just be bayonetta 3, and KLK doesn't really have many large enemies. I just think it would work better with handdrawn sprites, which 2D fighters allow. 




 There are more developed elite 4 backstories in the manga. 




 The only way KLK could work as a game is Persona 4 arena/ Jrpg style, however, I've had a fairly good Idea for season 2:

Season 2 would focus around a spec ops's style team, composed of Satsuki, Tsumugu, Uzu, Inamuta and nonon, trying to dismantle Revocs, which is now under the control of Rei, who is attempting to bring about the return of the live fibres (Sorry to Gamagoori fans, but if he was in the series people would focus way too heavily on his character, and, due to the season finale, we know there's no danger to him, also, the season would become about Mako/gamagoori shipping **again**) Ryuko and Mako don't appear, leaving their lives ambiguous. The show would be scaled down from kill la kill, having more grounded action and more characterization, as the life fibers have been destroyed, (comic relief is kept up by bickering, as is the hectic animation) therefore, the series focuses on Tsumugu and Satsuki making elaborate, batman esque plans, and having them usually horribly fail due to bickering and infighting, however, there are clear character arcs and motivations that the characters can undergo, further expanding and elaborating on the core series:

 Dwarf fortress Sips

PLS YES 




 Exactly, I thought the last couple of episodes as a whole focused way too much on giving the fans what they want rather than a satisfying narrative conclusion.  




 Exactly. Satsuki is really out of focus in the finale/discussion, because the shipping takes over the show. 




 Whilst I don't think of it as a 'huge milestone.' I do think it make the most sense within the context of the story. But because of that one Gamagoori still, everyone what would have been a sweet ending into a flame/shipping war. They could have just had a nice 'believe what you want to believe' ending,but now we have this petty shipping spat completely throwing the focus off Satsuki and Ryuko. 




 I Kind of think the OVA will put Rei in the spotlight. She will either be the 'bonus boss' or there'll be a season 2. She's too much of a loose end. 




 This was a weird direction for Shadow of Israphel episode #43 to go. 




 People saying there's nothing there really is just plain ignorance, there really is NOTHING disproving the RYUMAKO relationship. 




 I've never read, or have been interested in Kotaku, however, after hearing people talk about how bad it is on my beloved DTOID, I thought it was hyperbole, surely no website can be as bad as they say kotaku is? However, this is one of the most poorly researched, slanderous pieces of 'news' I've ever read. Tabloid level journalism, and blatantly ignores the fact that Ryuko sticks a syringe in her arm, meaning, even IF this article had any kind of point to make, it would be based on a false assumption. 




 Here's a slightly easier to understand version of the story: (http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AdrielWallick/20140331/214258/Lets_talk_about_accountability.php) 




 Essentially it was a simple polaris 'event' that became hideously overproduced when sponsors such as mountain Dew, and one particular asshole called Matti, got involved, it was basically a horrible experience for a multitude of people, and a huge waste of money for maker studios. 




 Maker studios created it's biggest event ever, costing over $400000, featuring all of it's major stars and big devs from the indie scene, however, due to the ignorance of marketing execs, and general bureaucracy, ot ended in dismal, unsalvageable failure, and is a testament to the perils of overproducing simple youtube concepts 









 Y'know, I always wondered why the mods don't do more stuff on the subreddit's they create.






Now I know. 




 Doesn't really make that much sense, they're both obviously just title sequences, which don't follow narrative requirements like points of view. OP 2 also logically can't be from Satsuki's POV, as she wasn't a good guy when it started airing. 




 Yeah, but the flaming has gotten pretty bad now, particularly as the Ryumako camp feels pushed into a corner, I think it was a bad decision to leave it this ambiguous. 




 Guardians of the galaxy says hello. 




 Said Yween, behind a wall holding flowers. 




 Nui is, in my opinion, the best character to come out of kill la kill. That kind of "I don't give a shit" dynamism and pragmatism are some of my general favorite character traits.  




 But I'm not in the ryumako camp (I assume calling it makogoori was a mistake) I'm just viewing it objectively, yes, Mako uses hyperbole and analogy, but if the imagery is of a romantic date whilst describing a date, I think she's talking about a romantic date. For example, when people talk about the xenomorth bit in ep 17, when  she uses that imagery we assume she's talking about an actual alien from the context and imagery, rather than assuming she's talking about an illegal alien. I would also point her trying to psyche Ryuko up implies even more she was talking about a romantic date. However, I also concede that the ending is till to ambiguous to judge until the OVA.  




 I really wish the ending was less ambiguous on this stuff, the speculation is ruining the community. 




 But in the context of that scene, it was clearly a spontaneous thing, and  it obviously didn't feature Satsuki in the description. Plus, if you use visual description, mako showed the date with romantic connotations, whilst I'm not invalidating Gamako, I genuinely think the ED didn't show the date In question. 




 Mako being all over Ryuko's body is Yuri, whether played for laughs or not. The ending has essentially separated the fanbase into have's and have not's, and, because neither side has conclusive proof, and neither side has conclusive rebuttal, people are resorting to stupid slurs. 




 Yeah, It was spoiled for me before I wrote the thread, I've been sarcastic. Basically I start with dark anime on Mondays, and then it gets lighter from there. 




 Since the academy is underwater, and the characters seem to have been re-adjusted (satsuki getting a haircut etc.) I think it's not the pivotal 'date' Ryuko keeps talking about in the climax. 




 Thanks brah! I'm totally hyped for watching episode 3! It sounds great! 




 Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?????? I thought it was super happy fun times with the magical girls? 




 Why would Ragyo care what gender something is? She only cares about helping life fibres spread in the universe. 




 I've been given you counter arguments this entire time! Let me summarize:


Having smaller Breasts means nothing, she has breasts, full stop, she's even shown nude in one scene which was explicitly not in Ryuko's head, it's about as relavent as saying nono or Rei is a boy, it's ludicrous.

The boy disguise is just that, a disguise, a major piece of foreshadowing in that episode was her appearing in a female bathroom.

Ragyo has shown no indication that she needed a boy, and also no indication that she personally sees nui as a daughter, and Nui was conceived out of life fibres.

Basically, none of that 'evidence' holds any water. Give up. 




 The evidence isn't there, nothing you've presented is evidence, at all. It's all subjective. 




 Episode 13, NUI, whilst still disguised as a boy, appears in a female bathroom cubicle, foreshadowing the disguise. Why does Ragyo want her to be a girl? Ragyo doesn't even see her as a daughter 




 A rocksteady Moon Knight game.
