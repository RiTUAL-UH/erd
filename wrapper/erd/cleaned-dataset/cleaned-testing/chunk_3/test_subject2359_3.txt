 NorCal here, stuck with DigitalPath.  It's either that or Frontier where I live. 




 RIP in peace, Big Stick. 




  Citizens should get to use the newly built DMV facilities across the state.

They can.  Absolutely nothing in the article you linked says that facilities are off-limits to legal citizens, just that they were built in response to an expected increase in demand.

There are *NO* immigrant-only DMV facilities.
 




 Along with some less than beautiful clear-cuts. 




  IIRC, the Feds closed the land in the 80s/90s, shutting down the timber industry.

The "timber industry" is doing just fine, including cutting on public lands.  They just have good anti-government PR that has everyone convinced that those poor, poor multi-billion dollar companies are struggling to get by thanks to the evil federal government.

The real fight is competition with cheaper foreign lumber. 




  China isn't expansionist, aside from Tibet. 

Russia, Vietnam, India, South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines would beg to differ. 




 That's right, we can't.  You being a prime example. 




 Yeah, we pretty much got this one. 




 Have some liquor ready.

It's Valentine's Day - way ahead of you. 




 Eh, the Burkes are pretty capable in that regard, equipped almost identically to the OHPs. 




 No, because it actually makes sense. 




 The way the weather's been in NorCal the past month or so, it could easily be in the '60s in the daytime. 




 I honestly don't remember.  I was born in '78, so he was Governor for most of my childhood, and I thought of him as Governor Marmaduke. 




  We could use another Pete Wilson,

No one could use another Pete Wilson. 




  George Deukmejian

Wow ... there's a name I haven't heard in a while. 




  Mccain and Romney were heirs apparent?

They've both sort of made a career out of running/possibly running for President. 




  Patrick Willis for the next 5 years as well?

He just turned 30 a couple of weeks ago, and ILBs seem to have a pretty long prime for some reason. 




  a dismal performance by the RN in my opinion.

Somewhat better flying and munitions handling by the Argentines, and it would've been a hell of a lot worse.  The RN got off easy, considering the opportunities the Argentines had to really wreck that fleet. 




 But ... but ... you aren't /u/silence_hr! 




 Fiberglass would work. 




 It's Kings Creek Meadow, a pretty popular spot for pictures. 




 Olympic is fine.

But a pump sprayer is going to take you just as long as a roller, if not longer, and won't apply as well - it tends to stand on the surface a bit instead of working in.  You're better off just biting the bullet and investing the time in rolling. 




 Any Malazan army, really.  They have a tendency to get wiped out in short order (while giving even worse than they get, of course). 




 You must be very drunk to have things so backwards.

See, I'm the guy providing evidence.  He's the guy making unsubstantiated assertions. 




 Colin Kaepernick was somewhat of a mess in 2014, with his inconsistency becoming problematic as his numbers dropped across the board despite a lot of support on both sides of the ball.

Ah, yes, that support that included about seventeen third-stringers, an OC that play-called with a Ouija board, and a formerly All-Pro Tight End that acted like he was out for a morning stroll once the ball was snapped. 




  I really like watching Aaron Rodgers lose.

So you enjoy watching the 49ers win? 




  Am I reading this wrong or is the US listed as zero war casualties?

The map seems to be about *where* the deaths occurred, not the country-of-origin of the people doing the dying.  That's why South Korea has so many, I suppose. 




   I believe the University is made up of more than just the arcanum. 

This is correct - it seems a lot of students are there to study more academic fields from the best teachers the Four Corners has to offer.  It seems that Simmon originally went to the University for exactly this sort of education, and Kvothe at first pretends to Threpe that's what he's there for. 




 Two weeks later, let me say that that's exactly the sort of thing I'm looking for.  I followed to another video of his where is seriously sounded like he was playing three damned tunes at the same time.

*That's* the kind of music Rothfuss writes about. 




 I'm not the one espousing conspiracy theories. 




 There are a few anecdotes in the KKC (more specifically AWMF) that Rothfuss drew on from real history, and in both cases French 18th Century history:

1.) Kvothe makes a joke to Denna in Severen about a certain lady losing her virginity in a theater box.  This is based on Julie de Lespinasse, who *actually did* lose her virginity (aged 42) in a Parisian opera box in 1770, to Comte Jacques-Antoine de Guibert.  She confirms this - or at least *claims* this - in letters to him.

2.) Fela's "Interesting Things" story about blind people who have their site restored, and have to be taught how to identify shapes by looking at them. To quote Will Durant from "The Age of Voltaire":

"[Diderot] was especially attracted by a question which the Irishman William Molyneux had raised about 1692: Will a man born blind who has learned to distinguish a cube from a sphere by touch, be able, if his sight is restored, to differentiate at once a cube from a sphere, or will he require, before he can make this distinction, some experience of the relations between forms touched and the same forms seen?  The latter answer had been given by Molyneux and his friend [John] Locke.

"In 1728 Willian Cheselden operated successfully upon a fourteen-year-old boy who had been blind from birth; the boy had to be trained before he could differentiate forms by sight alone."


I'd also note that 18th Century French history, as well as 16th   17th Century Renaissance history, is filled with the sort of polymathic geniuses that, if they only existed in fiction, would be decried as Mary Sues/Gary Stus.  

You know ... like Kvothe, but without the benefit of living in a world with true magic to become brilliant at.  If sympathy   sygaldry existed in the real world, men like Benjamin Franklin and Voltaire would've been the Kvothes of our history.  Can you imagine Leonardo di Vinci getting his hands on sygaldry? 




 I know who he is.  But, you see, you've wandered out of the World Nutjob Daily fever swamp - and into a place concerned with *facts* and *reality*, where the Scary Black Secret Muslim *wasn't* fathered by a Scary Black Communist.  Where Frank Davis was simply a friend of Obama's grandfather, a left-wing labor and civil rights advocate.  Where people don't hide under their bed from the FEMA black helicopters. 




 Pretty sure absolutely no-one, ever, in all of mankind, has ever hated not being *you*. 




 I wonder what brand of tin-foil you prefer. 




 Now do your own damn research, instead of carrying around goal posts because of what you don't want to believe.

 Hell, I've been waiting for a lot longer than that. 




  inaction on his part is pathetic.

Yes, he should have passed that bill in Congress, like the President totally has the power to do. 




 Doesn't she know that nukes are illegal in Davis? 




 If only there were some sort of easily accessible website where you could find out about his college life.  Better yet, some kind of combination of words, printed on paper, perhaps written by the person in question. 




 It's a 30 year average. Large parts of California *do*, normally, receive decent amounts of precipitation.  There's just a stark contrast with the parts that normally *don't*.

 U.S. Territories are, by definition, part of the U.S. 




 Puerto Rico is part of the US. 




 /r/badscience ----- is that way. 




 The government can tell us what to eat

No, it can't. 

It can determine what meals are served at public schools, which isn't remotely the same. 




 I started reading the *Wheel of Time* in 1989, when *Eye of the World* was first released.

A lot of people here probably weren't even born then. 




 Once you find yourself slogging through Book Nine, you'll wish it would. 




  Didn't she say her grandmother taught them to her?

That was Deoch. 




 It's pretty unlikely.  Nobility tend to guard their choice of livery, and the Maer strikes me as someone who would be more inclined than most not to be mis-represented. 




 Yes ... but in a SHTF situation, that mined salt will suddenly no longer be available.  So it'll suddenly be more valuable. 




 Those are the areas that would be flooded ... with *love*. 




 That's because it's mined from massive underground deposits.

If that ease of mining and distribution breaks down ... it'll skyrocket in value. 




  Here's me now

I've ... I've actually done that.  Probably had the same expression, too, but I'm white, so it wasn't quite as casually not-giving-a-fuck. 




 So did I, but the power was out for four days, so it wasn't really by choice. 




 Salt.  It's pretty damned hard to come by if you don't live next to an ocean, and it's very, very important for preservation. 




 I have "Catfish Billy" stuck in my head, and I was totally expecting to click on this thread and seeing someone mention a Yelawolf song.

You have disappointed me. 




 That ... was surprisingly accurate for the first thirty or forty seconds.

But it was pretty '80s after that. 




 That was actually pretty typical in the '90s.  Kids these days have it easy. 




  It's hard to believe, but i've always subscribed to idea that it's cheaper for one to just buy a prepared meal at a restaurant then go out and buy $20-$30 for stuff to cook some thing.

I just have to ask ... were you raised in a wealthy household?

Because I just can't imagine this mindset from a functioning adult who wasn't waited on hand and foot growing up. 




  Does anyone even care that Jerry Rice did?

I think the problem is that now, a lot of other receivers from that era can *claim* they didn't, whether they did or not, to make themselves look better.

But much like pine-tar or scuffing the ball for more than a century of major league pitching, we all know everyone did it. 




 Depends on what kind of aim Buffalo fans have. 




 My nickname for this coaching staff is "The Parliament."

Because much like a group of owls, all that I can hear is "Who? Who? Who?" 




 The two soldiers who beat up Kvothe/Kote were wearing blue and white - which are Alveron's colors (described in Severen as "ivory and sapphire).  And we know they're in Vint because the "king's coin" that  Aaron was looking to take was a gold noble. 




 "Do we have enough radars?"

"No."

"... OK, just added a few more radars, do we have enou-"

"NO!  MORE!" 




 Alveron IS one of my Top 3 candidates to be the Killed King

Except Alveron is still alive in the present-day frame.  There's really no one else who could be King, and wearing his colors.
 




  Because of the Hoover dam, the Colorado River doesn't even remotely reach the ocean anymore. 

That's because massive amounts of water are diverted for agriculture, industry, and residential use in California   Arizona (esp. California). 




 And now it's snowing, at a lower altitude than predicted (4500' where I'm at).  So ... that should be pretty damned helpful. 









 36, wearing three hoodies, but not tanned. Will trade one hoodie for a tan and a pick to be named later. 




 You've never dealt with the NYPD. 




  Are American biscuits anything like regular toast?

No.  Just ... no.  A proper Southern-style biscuit is in its own category of taste altogether.  Flaky, fluffy, a tad buttery, a bit savory ... and now I need a plate full. 




  This[2]  is apparently what an American calls a biscuit. This is a scone. It is a sweet

And there's where you've got it wrong.  There's nothing sweet about biscuits, especially Southern biscuits (which is what you put some nice, thick, sausage gravy over). 




  Many an American claims to be part Cherokee...

Well ... it's actually true for a lot of us.  The Cherokee moved around quite a bit, though not by choice. 




 Brain damage. 




  Manziel was extremely successful in college,

Which means precisely dick after Draft Day, except when it comes to *expectations to live up to*. 




  Davis is definitely the place to live if you like to bicycle and walk.


Seconding, thirding, and fourthing this.

Hell, I didn't *want* to drive when I lived in Davis (except to work in Woodland), simply because it's such a nice place to ride a bike, walk, or take a bus.  The Downtown grid, the Arboretum, the campus, all the little parks (Central, Chestnut, that one on Lake, etc.) ... very non-driving friendly.

 




 That was encouraging. 




  Steve Freeman's profile and gallery page

*clicks on link ...*

... oh, hey, look, it's two hours later.

I can't wait until he finishes his "U.S. aircraft carriers" graphic. 




 Part of the problem is that some counties cover a very wide range of altitudes.  This is especially obvious in eastern California - some of those narrow east-west counties start at 1-200 feet, and top out at anywhere from 6-10,000.

Colusa County, for example, is the Sacramento Valley, with a low point of about 45', and a high point of 7,055; Placer County goes from 145' to more than 9000', the high end being in the rather snowy (most years) Tahoe region.  




 I don't have to plan weeks in advance to buy a bottle of vodka and prepare to weep bitterfly.

 Sorry, this can't be Russian.  Not enough missiles. 




 It actually felt like the Niners were the 2014 off-season champs.

That was a nice feeling. 




  Cleaning my ears with cotton swaps.

That's not irrational. 




  Good god.

  It's been 12 years

No, it hasn't.  That's not possible.  Like, five at the outside. 




 Sadly, I'd probably have even less use for them then, than I do now. 




 If someone's paying taxes into the system, they should get paid back out same as anyone else.  Makes the whole system work a lot better. 




  It's not the government's job to protect people from their own stupidity or bad decisions.

No, it's the government's job to protect me from *other people's* stupidity or bad decisions.  Hence mandatory immunization, food safety laws, laws against drunk driving, etc. 




 I got twenty+ detailed questions in, then suddenly it said "no more room available in this group" or some such, and ended the survey.  This is the kind of fishing BS I expect from Survey Savvy or whoever, not an mTurk survey.

 Aluminum grain scoops actually work even better - with a steel flat-nosed for chipping at the icy stuff (or just plain ice). 




  a 4-star Michelin restaurant

There's no such thing ... 




   I didn't even know that sub existed.

Looks like it doesn't. 




 From a recent birth announcement in my local paper:  Paytin and Idalise.  Born to a couple named Kinderlin and Tristan.

(And a few weeks later, we get EmiLee, with sister Makaela). 




 WTF are you rambling about? 




  Ever had a younger sibling start a new pokemon adventure after a hundred plus hours?

Worse - Final Fantasy III (SNES) after more than a hundred hours. 




 ... I don't understand the question.  There are people that write in non-textbooks?  Like, free, rational, thinking people who are allowed to reproduce? 




 Immunization rates by country -

WHO:

http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tscoveragebcg.html

UNICEF:

http://data.unicef.org/child-health/immunization

These are very well known facts.  But hey, you have Youtube videos showing poor funny-talking poor brown people, right? 




  Also, what makes one a "personal issue" and not the other?

The fact that one is *dangerously contagious*, and the other *isn't*.

You're trying real hard to force an equivalency that doesn't exist. 




 Or, you know, maybe some of us are capable of reading WHO statistics on immunization.

http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tswucoveragebcg.html

It's almost like immunization is a very cheap, wide-spread process that even Third World countries see high levels of.  But all you know is "herr derpy derr brown people eat shit and are dirty derpity derr." 




 The article you linked to just makes you look even more stupid.  Great job on that. 




  Those counties happen to be the most liberal in the country.

Orange county is fairly conservative. 




 You'll be a pretty short drive from King's Canyon and Sequoia National Parks, which are spectacular, and less crowded than Yosemite. 




 Niners fan checking in.

Now you *almost* know how we feel about shitty last-second Super Bowl play-calling.  Except it was one play, not four, and you had last year.

But yeah, it sucks, doesn't it? 




 Well, that was the most thorough case of shooting one's self in the foot I've ever seen. 




 That felt a lot more like Seattle losing than Tom Brady winning. 




 Are there any *lower* bandwidth streams out there?

If I could afford the kind of connection for what's being posted, I could afford not to stream. 




 Well, they've done college basketball games on a carrier, wonder how hard it would be to do a full-sized football game? 




 DDH-142 *Hiei*, that would be. 




 See above. 




  Do you have examples? I didn't see any personally, I'd love to see what I missed. Purely out of curiosity.

The three that stood out:
First, when Kvothe, Sim, and Wil were demonstrating sympathy to Denna, Kvothe as narrator says that she had never seen sympathy before. Except she had, in Trebon, when he lit that shingle on fire.

Second, when in Severen, Denna mocks him for even mentioning the Chandrian, when she was fully on-board - at length - in Trebon in wondering what the Chandrian were up to. Unless she's completely amnesiac about literally everything that happened in Trebon, this makes no sense.

Third, Mola didn't recognize Auri in NotW, when she should have according to what we're told in WMF: that all the girls at the University live in the same wing of the Mews, and all know each other. Mola's been there for about five years, Auri is apparently about twenty (give or take a year), they would've met while Auri was a student.

EDIT:  Also, Kvothe shouldn't have been surprised to learn that Sim's father was a duke.  After all, that's one of the first things he's told about Sim in NotW.
