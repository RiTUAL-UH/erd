 Followup question is how is this funny 




 From the story I heard everyone there got a blue ribbon but PBR just started advertising their beer with that spin 




 Perfect ending song 




 I LOVE YOU SO MUCH YOU FUCKING FUCK 




 As much as I dislike the same questions getting asked the top comments are almost always a different story so it still keeps it interesting/funny. I laugh way harder at these comments then I do on /r/funny 




 We don't know why Victoria was calling. Probably to say she's off to bang Klaus 




 Murtaugh List, Pineapple incedent, Ted Mosby-Architect, Robots Vs Wrestlers

Let's be honest though there's plenty more that could be substitutes  




 lol! I also stock dry grocery. I feel your pain 




 So a slutty candle? 




 Washington is totally privatized with alcohol. You can buy it at Walmart

Source: I sell it at Walmart 




 This is more just a reminder but everyone in NY (and everywhere else) should wash their hands daily. One of the biggest spreaders of disease especially with fecal-oral microbes  




 Yeah the CCR5 receptor. Apparently all apes are resistant to the virus. Just me considering possibilities here but with the high amounts of this virus concentrated in Africa maybe we will see more people with this mutation throughout generations to come. 









 Yep. Also possible brake with right foot but you just hope that doesn't happen 




 It gets tricky when you're on the phone, turning, and have a manual transmission 




 Everyone at my school uses the trays as sleds during the winter 




 This stuff is all over Washington, you see it all the time here. Oregon too I'm sure 




 I always get the supremely spicy hummus, so I guess that? 




 I'm confused by their argument, shouldn't every establishment be closed at night then? 




 This scene with George IMO is his best as a character. Just the true ideology of George all into one speech. And Jason is a great actor in it 




 Good luck! I'm sure you're prepared for it, just remember everything it took to get there 




 Sorry but I have to ask.. Is the butter local? 




 Nothing says the morning like poppin pills 




 Damn that sounds good 




 Thick coffee? You may have to make this for me sometime 




 You can never go wrong with a nice glass of water 




 Wow I am sorry man (or woman?) Hope it doesn't reflect on the rest of your day 









 She was a physicians assistant? Respect 




 Yeah maybe. Idk it sounded big but anticlimactic  




 I got in halfway through and now the sirens have stopped. Not sure what happened to him but sounded like he was fine 




 Before this guy gets downvoted to hell just remember we're just considering options here 




 Anyone listening right now during all these sirens? Something about a person unconscious, medics going out  




 There's definitely a group mentalitiy in the workplace. If everyone there is friends with each other and happy then there's less chance they are going to leave. I work at a Walmart and my coworkers are actually pretty cool. Personally I won't be there much longer but it's not bad at the same time 




 babe wait babe noooo 




 They called fluffy fingers 




 You always hear about business owners giving people shit for giving them bad reviews. I don't know what's going on here 




 Not to bust on the show here but after Who Wants to be a Godparent I can't blame him 




 Wow that is a daunting task

You should include a count number for all the scotches Ted and Barney drink

Now that I think about it is Marshal and Lily the only people who don't like scotch?  




 It's always fun when you show up to the date, see she looks nothing like her profile, and instantly know the next 3 hours are going to be awful.

Off Tinder though the girl was actually awesome and we had coffee and sang in the car. Of course, at the end she said she was one month away from actually being 18... 




 Not only that but that's a really famous line. How do you fuck up the order of it 




 Dangus the Mangus 




 Because no one wants to go into the dentists, so you have people who come in already hating you. Then you have a rough schedule to keep between their responsibilities. And people's mouths are gross 









 I've got the free breakfast sandwich if anyone wants brunch with me 




 He's had a few rough nights designing this traffic utopia leave him alone 




 Seriously! In high school I was pretty quiet but people would always ask "are you alright?" Like yeah I'm alright now get out of my business! 




 Last week I finally finished Atlas Shrugged after months of reading it. I'd post my thoughts of it on here but too drunk and too many thoughts of it ha 




 Favorite book from high school.  




 Dude you are on a roll today 




 I like that umbrella part. I've also heard that With Tracy it was already raining, but with Robin Ted had to make it rain 




 That's exactly my point really. He's basing his whole exodus based on a republican be voted in next. Well who knows what the next republican might be like. Maybe he'll change America for the better 




 You do realize there have been more Republican presidents than Democratic ones right?  




 I think 100 million is a little much for this situation. For most people here that'd be over a million per year, and that would already be far more than most of us make. 

But Like other people said set up long term investments 




 That the girl you think is into you is definitely into you 




 Well my one item would have to be the check the lottery people wrote me. Then go back in time say the 40's when I can actually use the check. Of course then my present lottery winnings are worth fortunes more. I then buy the US government, bang the First Lady of the time. Then I'd die fighting in Germany whistling a Charlie Parker tune 




 Math. Which is weird because I can do physics/chem type math but actual math classes I've never been good with. I think it's the lack of application the book's present 




 I've done it a couple times. Met up with this one chick, we smoked and watched a movie. Later we were making out and she wanted to have sex but I didn't go through with it, kindof a weird time for me.

Other time she ended up being like 45 and again I didn't go through with it 




 I just want to work at an independent coffee shop in Seattle and live in a crappy apartment. I'm a senior in college now and think about seriously doing it all the time :/ 




 Holographic Pincer card for some lame card I had, can't  remember which 




 As an item of symbolism or what? 




 Back in 8th grade my friends and I counted down the days til Battlefront 2 came out. Now I've been waiting years 




 The episode that's an entire freakin documentary of Robin Sparkles makes me want to punch somebody.  I mean it was funny at first but I feel like it became more of an inside joke for the actors/writers than to us the audience 




 TIL adenosine=adrenaline from a high school bio student 




 Same here and since Ted says it like 20 times in the episode I figured actually saying bitch each time would be a little ridiculous. I agree though c word makes more sense for reactions 




 I work at walmart and we have chip readers along with the magnetic ones. The chip ones seriously take at least a minute to read (sounds short but not when there's a line). If we're gonna use the chip readers they need to optimize them 




 That's no ~~small moon~~ balloon 




 Just about every girl wearing leggings/yoga pants is wearing a thong 




 This is like straight out of a sitcom. Someone randomly playing the piano and it just happens to be a celebrity. I'm sure you guys will be telling that story for a long time 




 Tangled up we fall 




 A ball point banana! 




 I wouldn't say Marshal is two dimensional, but sometimes I feel like his personality is all over the place. I feel like they add traits to him for jokes but they don't always make sense for his charaacter 




 Fully agree with the changing thing. They made it sound like their only reason was "we want the kids to look like they're still the same age." Well through some more makeup on them because the Season 9 HIMYM is not Season 2 HIMYM 




 The only food I think of with Wisconsin now is their frozen custard. I wish I could eat that forever 




 How do they get the mail? 




 Grabs spork 




 I felt the same way. I think my biggest complain is they left out not only major characters but the major plot that went with said characters. We miss a lot of the conflict resolution with the film 




 Rating: T for Teen 




 Awesome thank you 




 The lens on that camera though.. Also fellow Seattleite I see 




 the cheeks suggest cocaine though 




 Some Lovers Try Positions That They cannot Handle

Some Say Marry Money But My Sister Says Big Boobs Matter Most

Oh Oh Oh To Touch And Feel A Virgin girls Vagina Such Heaven

ahh anatomy 




 Survived Oregon Trail-Geoducks-Rained then Rained now-Grunge was made- Basketball team taken away 




 Yeah that's what I am hoping to do. Should I just post on there what I want and offer some things I have? 




 He missed a beat. Just one single beat.. 




 Just in time to beat that record this year 









 And even that wasn't funny. 




 The US Army HATES #8 




 I've been subscribed here for awhile now but now totally sure how to get into it. Should I just go to the store with paper and write down everything I could trade? My local store has tons of Seattle/Spokane/PNW beer  




 Wow if a nail in a board where a shoe slides in is that long for a patent I can't imagine what an engine patent looks like 




 Is there no gravity on that hat? 




 A Phoenix Suns colored tent in Phoenix? Of course they'll let him 




 Spent 6 hours on it. Probably would take 10 minutes now on PS 




 I hope this guy doesn't drive to job interviews in that truck 




 Yep.  Especially for pre-health people if you haven't worked in a hospital/pharmacy/OR you're at a disadvantage already 




 So after his face smashes into the steering wheel he thinks hmm that was nothing, guess I'll keep going. Then gets stuck again 




 A paragon!! 




 my 8th grade IMs.. I shudder to think. In high school the girl I always talked to wanted to go back and read them one day but I refused 




 I thought that word died out awhile ago. And I hate people who act like they're making Sperry's cool, as if they haven't been for like 100 years now 




 I've only seen this on the internet and still don't know what it means or how to pronounce it 




 Pumpkin beer is probably my favorite seasonal. The flavor is good but only for a short bit so one month of it is perfect 




 Ther's also the Bro Code book they made. It's actually pretty funny 




 This quite annoyed me as well. Now I'm trying to think of how he got more slaps later but it's not coming to me.. 




 I would hate constantly getting asked how much a tattoo cost. 




 Same here. Astigmitism in both eyes and I can't even read the newspaper

And yet just to the right is someone biking and texting 




 Hello Hello.. Hola! 




 I've been asked a couple times if I wear mascara, and I'm a guy. It was weird 




 Once again we're on top by 3000 votes. ~~if~~ when we win this NC State looks like they actually have a cool logo. I think we'll take it home though
