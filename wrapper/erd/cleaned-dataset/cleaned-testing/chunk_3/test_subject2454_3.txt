 Like, if I wanted people's opinions on product X without sounding like I'm just trying to drum up positive pub for product X.

Or If I saw a commercial during the Superb Owl which piqued my interest. 




























































































































 78"

I think this might be the factor that gives him his greatest advantage over his opponents in the middleweight division.  His reach measures a ridiculous 78", which a lot of heavyweights don't even have.  Similar to Jon Jones, he is extremely successful at using his freakish body to keep people away.  No one in the MW even comes close.  Hell, even Cain Velasquez only measures 77".  People clamoring on about how Machida, Mousassi, and Belfort will destroy this guy seem to forget what JJ did to two of those guys (And I'm a diehard Machida fanboy).

Will Weidman have the same success as JJ?  Who knows.  Jones' greatest asset is his intelligence in the cage and his ability to adapt to opponents mid fight.  Weidman seems to be able to do that so far.  His striking still looks weird and sloppy to me, but he's got a fantastic coach that is continuously refining that aspect of his game.  His wrestling prowess is already known.  The only unknown seems to be his submission game, and like Jones, we haven't seen him in a position to be submitted yet.

Am I talking out of my ass?  Who knows?  Probably.  But does anyone else think that his incredible genetics will keep him at the top for a while?  Why or why not?  If I'm making a stupid argument, please break it down and call me a noob or whatever.  But until someone convinces me otherwise, I'm hellbent on believing that his 78" arms are gonna hold on to that belt for a little bit. 

I'm not saying that reach is everything, but Jones' dominance stems from his ability to use it effectively, and so far, Weidman seems to be learning from JJ's sucsess.

Anderson Silva's reach was also a ridiculous 77.6".


Cain Velasquez: 77"

Cigano: 77"

Travis Browne:  80"

Bigfoot:  82"

**Jon Jones: 84"**

Rashad:  75"

Phil Davis:  79"

Gus:  79"

Glover:  76"

**Weidman:  78"**

Machida:  74"

Belfort:  74"

Mousassi:  76"

Jacare:  74" 









 I honestly want to know what weakness people believe Meisha can exploit to get a win, and how?  KO?  Sub?  Decision? 













































































































 We're talking Cigano.

I personally think he could benefit from a Machida camp.  If anyone knows how to not get bullied by wrestlers, that's the guy.  I don't think I've ever seen Machida grinded against the cage like Cigano was last night.

Or if not Machida, then perhaps a Munoz camp?

What are your opinions? 




 Three major upsets in college football, followed by a #3 vs #5 ROFL stomping by FSU.  Then Boston wins the god damn pennant.  Then, the UFC puts on the most entertaining card possibly in their history.  In all the excitement, I neglected hockey.  Anything interesting happen? 




 A few years ago I traded B.J. Ryan and Alex Rodriguez for Ladanian Tomlinson.  It was weird, but both teams benefited since they were both dynasty leagues.

Same commish for both leagues, so he allowed it after thoughtful examination. 




 His targets and catches have been steadily increasing.  He's a big boy, and Stafford seems to be trusting him more and more every week.  If Detroit doesn't trade for a WR, might he be the answer to our WR2 prayers? 























































































































 I have Witten/Cook, and Seattle/SanFran.  Should I drop one of them to pick up Bernard Pierce? 

























































































 Is Connor basically the ultra aggressive version of Lyoto?  Everything that Joe Rogan says about him describes Lyoto.  Wide karate stance, superior recognition of distance, great vertical movement, kicks with no windup, etc, etc, etc.

Obviously he doesn't have Machida's ground game, but is it fair to say that his standup is an aggressive Machida style? 









 I'm not culturally caught up with celebrity drama, but Spike's recent AMA sure did bring out a lot of haters.  I counted at least twenty people call him a piece of shit without explaining why he's a piece of shit.

Can someone catch me up?

Dynasty league with 40 man rosters.  These are the available 3B options in my league, and I just traded David Wright for a shit load of prospects, including Sano.  I'm not in title contention, and I've stocked up on draft picks for next year.  I just need a 3B to finish out this year.  I don't want to be accused of tanking, and beyond that, someone owns my first rounder. 









 UFC or otherwise.  I just want a schedule to follow.  I get most, if not all, of my MMA news from this sub, and it's been great.  But the lack of a calendar or something is quite frustrating.

It wouldn't even be difficult.  We could do it like the /r/IAmA sub, and just list the events that are coming up.

Any thoughts?  Or am I being too unreasonable? 















































































 This is literally the worst time to do so.  Your friends and family are going to be more religious than ever, and this will cause a greater chasm to form between you and them.  We all know, and have experienced, how even the most even keeled liberal muslims go batshit crazy during Ramadan.  Because of the fake nature of Islamic spirituality, you really have to pick and choose the right times to fight the right battles.  Ramadan is not the right time.  Neither is Hajj season.  Stay away from those two events on the calendar when making life altering proclamations to your family.
 




















































































 There is always a  ^  in front of a pitcher who is starting that day.  I check my rosters every day.  Well, today, Yahoo did not have the  ^   by Travis Wood or Dillon Gee's names.  I completely missed Wood's start, and just barely got Gee into my lineup.

Has this happened to anyone else?  This is not the first time either.

 Is this the USA network's attempt at a gritty corrupt cop drama like FK's "The Sheild?"  Because if it is, I don't think they will succeed.  If they want to stick to their USA formula for dramas like Burn Notice, and Cover Affairs, they'll be alright.  But trying to go gritty when you have no clue is just unwatchable television.  A lot like TNT's failed cop drama two years ago with Dylan McDermott called "Dark Blue" or "Deep Blue" or something like that. 




 It is not a credit card, but a charge card, so it does not report any hard limit to the credit bureaus.  But if I spend money on it, it most certainly does report that information.

Will my credit take a hit if I close it?  It's is a pretty old account, and it does have an annual fee.  It was advantageous to get it at the time, as I had no credit.  But now that I'm doing ok, should I close it out?
