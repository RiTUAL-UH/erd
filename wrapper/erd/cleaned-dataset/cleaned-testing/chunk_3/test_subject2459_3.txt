 I just relapsed today, don't worry about it. I'm just going to pick myself up an  learn from it. Here, good [luck](http://imgur.com/cU848GQ) 









 The last time I started nofap I made it to twelve days and decided ah well... I guess you can guess what happened. Now I'm resetting my counter for the third and last time!! If anyone else is really serious message me and we can help each other stay on track but if you're not serious please, don't waste my time. 




 Hey no problem :) 




 I'm a guy, I do. I think it looks nicer going bald for a number for a number of reasons. It makes you look bigger, if you know what I mean. It looks cleaner. Feels nice and smooth. And a million other reasons. 




 I understand about most things being drugs but I'm talking about illegal drugs. Even if it became legal though I wouldn't go near it just like I don't smoke ciggarettes. 




 Cause it's a drug, I would never go near it but I'm not against those that do. To each his own. I dislike the idea of it cause it seems to dumb down those that take it and it stinks worse than anything!! 




 But I grabbed his arm back, then a monstrous creature arose from the drug. It turned out it was a super scary homogenous sassy Hasidic Jewish snow yeti... 




 It turns out uncle Ben, yes old uncle Ben who is always so kind and collected, was part of an underground snail racing club and they were feeding the snails steroids. When I bailed him out we went home. He laughed about it, even back then. When we got home we walked into our tiny, tiny apartment and we couldn't believe what we saw...

 Hi I'm scottish too :)

I...

* Get up

* eat

* wash

* Get dressed

* watch tv

* go to school  




 I'm not done with it by my face has gotten longer and I look a lot better.  




 Yeah, I love his videos. I've been watching him since he only had a few thousand subscribers (I'm not a hipster :) ) but yeah his videos are supercalifragilisticexpidaliotious. 




 Can I ask, do you watch Matthew Santoro on YouTube? 




 Jesus Christ!! Yes! Tell someone and help get it dealt with. 




 Exact same for me I have a big family my mum has it better/worse depending on how you look at it. She had 7 brothers and 6 sisters and  5 of the boys are dead. 




 I know right they foreshadowed what's going to happen to poor Glenn, Mwahaha, mwahahahaha!! 




 I know I'm not him but a lot of celebrities make reddit accounts so they can do AmA's I mean look at /u/boogibs she did her Ama, posted one more thing and left. She might not be a big name but it's still the same. 




 Did you like the way you died on the Walking Dead? Do you think Tyreese deserved better or do you think it was his time? 




 Ok thanks (I'm so I don't have a wife yet). 




 You're welcome, good luck again :) 




 I've done (am still doing) nofap and it was/is very helpful but I was just wondering if masturbation is a sin. 




 Hello, first of all thank you for not just assuming that all religious people are "bible bashing idiots" and taking the time to form your own opinions. I have many reasons for following my religion. Jesus was alive, that has been proven, now people might not believe in the virgin birth or in the miracles like we do, however, I think that even if it turns out that every religion on Earth is wrong it is better to believe in something, anything, and have a chance at going somewhere better. Now that's not why I follow my faith. I follow it cause it's a nice way to live life. Sure even non religious people can lead great lifes and most do but it's nice having some guidelines. Also I feel like we have added emotions. When we feel like we've done something good that will please the lord it lasts long and if we sin the guilt is immediate. I also wonder how people can look at our  universe and not believe in god. I don't believe everything in the bible for example Adam and Eve. I think that story is used to show why there is sin and suffering in the world. When people ask why a god would allow such horrible things like rape and murder to exist the answer isn't simple. I don't know it. I don't. I'm having trouble wording this but religion is there and I would be willing to die for mine. I know that sounds extreme but it's true. I have a million and one thoughts in my head but I can't word them so if they come to me later I will return and re write/word this post. Good day and god bless. 




 I'm not saying there is but don't you think it would be better to say nothing than say something mean? Or at least try and say something nice. Obviously you have an opinion and I respect that but I don't agree with how you voice it. 




 All done, good luck with your project. When you get an A+ come back and let us know :) (no but seriously I hope you do well). 




 Thank you, so I should stop. Whenever I "finish" I feel horrible. It's like I know I've sinned but I chose to do it anyway. 




 I know how you feel, I lost my dog. I'll say a prayer for you just now. I do think that animals get into heaven. I don't believe God would create them simply to send them to hell and I definitely don't believe that they just rot. So that leaves me with the conclusion that they get into heaven. 




 I'll add you to my prayers :) 




 I'll pray for you :) 









 I'm not the best looking or the worst and I'm not saying looks aren't important but I would much rather spend time with a girl who was a bit ugly but had a great personality than a girl that looked great but had a not so great personality. 




 Ok so if someone isn't great looking you make them feel bad by swearing? If you thought they were ugly you shouldn't have said anything cause it hasn't made you or them feel any better. 




 I know a ton of people my age that party, I just don't really enjoy being around people I don't know (I'm kind of introvert but happy and confident around friends but put me in an uncomfortable social situation and I become a weird version of myself. If I like someone though I will ask her out after weeks of forcing myself to just say it). Yeah a lot of 15 year olds party just not very regularly. 




 That's horrible. They went to a dance and had fun people's looks don't matter and I wouldn't say either of them are ugly... [this](http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=fat+and+ugly FORM=HDRSC2#view=detail id=AF9B62FE4D44CEB1E87FEE2D874F29F5B93C03EA selectedIndex=116) is ugly!!

(By the way I wasn't joking neither of them are bad looking). 




 Good for you two, hope you both had fun :) , 




 I never go out to parties :) 




 I know right!! (I used a kind of crappy app cause I was bored) 




 I want to be an archaeologist and I'm lucky cause I live in Scotland which still needs archaeologists. Failing that I want to study medicine and become a medical doctor. I also want to meet a girl, get married and have tons of kids but that can wait for a while :) 




 Dogs by far. They listen, play with you, spend time with you and will stand by you. Cats just sit there. I spend more time with my dogs than I do with people. 




 Thanks I found something that works for me :) 




 Although I'm not going to take it as a negative. I was twelve days though and as a teenager my hormones are already a mess so I was getting a lot of urges, for the most part I was able to fight them but then I said:

 I know I'll feel crappy and I know this and I know that but I want to...

So after I did it (don't worry I never used porn) I said:

"Okay no big deal, just get back up and start again"

And that's what I intend to do. This time I'm going to beat twelve days. I'm going to get up dust myself down and try again. This is actually good because I learned from it and that's why I'm not going to get mad or angry at myself. I got overly confident, the first ten days were fine so I became cocky, no more. So I'll see you all when I get another (1) in my badge and then a (2) and all the way up. For now I'm going to take it one day at a time. 




 Nice post!! :D 




 I love(d) scrubs but I feel like it got pretty bad when J.D wasn't there for the last while. I mean they referenced him but it wasn't the same. I still loved every season. 




 I want to be an archaeologist, I guess here it's different. I don't really know many people that consider themselves "photographers". 




 I know what you mean. I guess I just never noticed it before but sex is everywhere. I love the movie bad teacher but when I watched it again for the first time in a year or so last week I got so turned on. There's a carwash scene that I used to just shrug off but it's weird to see just how sexual everything actually is. 




 A lot of people say that it takes 90 days (+-30) before you see any real benefits so you have two options.

* Quit and try and moderate it but just don't watch porn

* push through for one more month and take it from there.

Good luck :) 




 I can back this up, as a socially awkward "nerd" I had few friends and in one of my first classes in high school I was made to sit with some guys. They became my best friends and we hung out all the time. That was just by chance.  




 Thanks you two :) 




 Do you shave? Which moisturizer do you think is best? 




 Great review, you just got a new sub!! :D 




 I loved that game, still do I've completed every tomb raider made (besides the crappy game boy ports) :) 




 Are you just finding this out? Ah well pretty cool huh? 




 Ha, ha that got on my nerves!! :) 




 I have long hair so for me I couldn't do that but kudos!! :D 




 Yeah go for it, just don't let your parents find out and if they do tell them you like her and want to go out with her. 




 So the past 11 days have been kinda easy for me so I checked nofap frequently and constantly reminded myself why I wanted to do this. Then today I never really came here and I was fine through most of it. You know the saying:

"Sex sells"

Well because of porn I never really noticed this and when I was watching tv there were so many hot things that I used to just shrug off. At first I was fine I did the usual, remind myself why I was doing it and said will I fap? NO! Then did the 10-10-10 rule. I was fine but it got worse so I edged onced but stopped midway and said:

"Do I want to throw the last eleven days down the drain? Do I want to feel the regret later?" I stopped and listened to some music. I now know 100% why I'm doing this. So I'm happy to say I don't have to reset my counter today and I've learned from this. Thank you all for the motivation here on nofap. 




 Ok thanks :) 




 How short do you leave it? I shaved it but I'm fine with letting it regrow to a certain length. I do think that if it's short it looks like you're just starting puberty. On the flip side I have something that's stopped all itching, nivea men 48 hr for sensitive skin, it's stopped all itching. 




 Do you shave? 




 Nah but I just got sick of my pubes getting caught on my boxers is all. 




 Good luck!! :D 




 I can imagine what are you studying. 




 Do you shave? 




 I know right :) 




 Okay that's what I did thank you :) 




 I've already shaved. I did it in the bath. Shaving cream, stroke, under water and then repeat. 




 Don't worry I'm 15 I don't plan on sex for another few years 




 Oh... thanks anyway. 




 Ok thanks. 




 Ok do you/have you shave(d)? How can I prevent an itch? 




 ***UPDATE*** can I ask, what do girls prefer? I don't plan on having sex any time soon but I'm just wondering. I know it varies from girl to girl. If you are a girl what do you prefer and if you're a guy what do you do? 




 Yes but it wasn't in this sub. I've always wanted to be a doctor but I love history too and I spoke to an archaeologist and she really inspired me now I'm studying that and I'm very grateful to her. 









 I found out today someone even made a sub called /r/yesfap just to oppose this!! 




 All done, I'm 15 so I'm obviously a virgin 




 Don't reset your counter, dreams don't count :) 




 I love Jenna Marbles she's hilarious!! 




 Check out /r/nofap if you want to quit the masturbating. 




 Ha, ha there's a few reasons say it like this:

Fap-stro-naut sounds like fap so not. We won't fap.

We're doing something most people won't

And if we stop fapping our life can finally take off (like a rocket) we get more self esteem, energy etc, etc. 




 Good luck!! You can do it, here are a few [tips](http://m.imgur.com/cU848GQ) that might help you out. :) 




 I agree. 




 If I were you I'd go to a doctor or you could try /r/nofap that takes away anxiety and gives a lot of benefits. Still I suggest you see a doctor incase something's wrong. 




 I know that's true. I had a dream were I failed it was awful but I woke up and couldn't believe that I was still going I was happy and it reminded me how bad it could get if you give in. 




 Ha, ha great job, good luck aswell you can do it!! :D If you want them here are some [tips](http://m.imgur.com/cU848GQ) that might help you. 




 Hey I like your attitude. Here are a few [tips](http://m.imgur.com/cU848GQ) that might help you out. For music wise I suggest Clean bandit, they play instruments beautifully and when they work with Jess Glynn it comes out amazing!! Their songs 'Real Love' and 'Rather Be' are great. Good luck. 




 Ha, ha :D 









 I played it, I loved it and I never had to deal with them. 




 Ha, ha :) 




 Thanks :) 




 Aaaw :) 




 I see what you're saying.  




 If it did you wouldn't be able to move around your house. 




 I love jurassic park!! 




 No I'm not I wanted to stop because I saw on here all of the negatives and I didn't want become like that, before I started I was only fapping once or twice a week.  




 Things like gaming can be considered addiction as the it exhibits the same withdrawl symptoms as drugs, chocolate and coffee contain caffein and porn has negative effects on the brain. 




 I love music and learning too :) 




 Well I love halo :) 




 I play the keyboard, piano, drums and glock :) 




 Maybe it has nothing to do with nofap I would go to a doctor if I was you and take it from there but do mention nofap to him/her. 




 Oh well waters good for you :) 




 Ha, ha you are excused :) 




 I love music too what instrument(s) do you play? 




 Cool well happy hoarding. 




 Oh that's too bad I couldn't live without milk. 




 I LOVE chocolate milk I drink it everyday!! :)

 Milk's nice and oretty good for you I drink a lot of that. 




 I love the justice league!! :D you should do the next few after the suicide squad. 




 I'm not fat but I drink more milk than anyone I know and I love chocolate!! :D 




 That's good you can still drink them but just do it in moderation, it will be good for you too since they both contain tons of sugar and sweeteners. 




 Cool but really 13TB oh my god you must have a lot!! :) 




 Ha, ha I think that's the strangest I've heard yet but if you enjoy it who am I to judge :) 




 Me too, I'm on here a lot recently. 




 Ooooh me too :) 




 Ha, ha I buy xbox games to play them although I must admit I do love the smell of new shoes. 




 Ha, ha :) good luck  




 Ha, ha I don't think I will.
