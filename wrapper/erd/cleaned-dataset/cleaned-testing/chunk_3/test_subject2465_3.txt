 The CIA is really going overdrive on these counter-intelligence news stories.

i love it though. 




 "trying"  




 You're right. No hostage has ever been killed.

Ever.

 Its funny because Bill O'Reilly talks about how he grew up in Levittown but ignores the blatant red lining that prevented anyone who was a shade darker than him from moving in 




 Yeah you are. You're butthurt 


This offends you so you can't grasp it being remotely true.  




 This must be the first time you've heard this. Go read about red-lining.  




 Simple question 

Would the ends ever justify the means in any case when it comes to Iraq? 














 Yet when something happens, you'll claim the government didn't do enough 




  supposed beheading of James Foley

So where is his head? 




 Theres a lot of muslim countries just over the water who have individuals seeking asylum in Australia.

and muslims see themselves as all apart of the same tribe 




 How is it fear?

You all claim the intelligence agencies never do enough when things DO happen, yet claim you're being coerced into submission when they issue warnings.  









 I don't think geopolitics is fair. 




 Its kinda hard to stop them. 

Cause North Korea and Pakisan said they'd stop and lied and went right ahead with it. 




 I only care about whats in the US's best interest.  




 Sarin attack...? 




  Still, why do you think the US should be able to kill anyone they want?

Its in the US's interest. 

 




 He's so lucky they didn't shoot his ass 




 Do you truly know who A.Q. Khan is and why what he did is so important? 




 Iran, don't forget what happened last time: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Praying_Mantis 









 Who is even getting that at this point? 




 Btw, saddam DID have a nuclear ambition at one point. He bragged about it. 

Obviously he stopped though.  




 Does NYC need more train lines? If so, where? 

Curious to see what NYCers think  




 "accept" 

Uh...they didn't have a choice.  




 \*slow clap\* 




  Saudi Arabia an Pakistan have a "special" relationship.

Basically. Its on the border of Iran and its Sunni Islam.

Win-Win 




 I mean...after proof he got Pakistan and then North Korea, Iran, and at this point more-or-less Saudi Arabia...why is he still allowed to live? 

Why haven't any intelligence organizations taken him out?

If WWIII starts, he'll be remembered right there with Gavrillo Princip  




 Its INFINITELY worse than Iran. 




 How many car parts do you need until you call it a car? 




 Exactly.

The whole "royalty" thing isn't going to last into the 21st Century 




 It sucks because it essentially makes it impossible to remove the royal family. ...which is urgently needed 




 I never understood why A Q Khan was never killed.

That dude is the Gavrillo Princip of WWIII 




 **Fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu** 









 See, these types of gotcha-talking points don't fix anything in the present  




 Is this from the Taiwanese animators? 




 Pwned 




 What changes the NaCl from one place to another?
 




 The studies are flawed. 




 See Islam, this is what happens. 









 Its so sad.

ATL could be on Boston/DC level 




 i.e. Atlantic Station and the entire Westside 




 In the 90s, it was THE place to go. It was always packed...now...well.. 
























 It doesn't mean they're secretly gay though.

Gays may be a scape goat, but its hard to get the general public educated about something that has been for thousands of years viewed as taboo in very traditional and poor societies . 

 









 http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/05/12/fhritp-could-be-a-crime-say-toronto-police.html 









 and Mano would have messed it up 














 This is amazing to me.

here we have a BLATANT example of racism in action and people will jump through any hoop to justify the condition of black and brown people in the world 




 Some of these guys ARE NOT whistle-blowers. 









 In the age of google, how can you patently say such a stupid thing?

Africa is nothing IF NOT Christian and Muslim 




 The orthodox church runs russia now 




 Reddit said racism doesn't exist

Its just black people not trying hard enough.  














 Good. 




 Theres no proof of this.

All it said was the same unit...a unit composed of dozens of people.  




 Here is him doing All Day:

 Governments always lie. 

This isn't a big lie.  




 This is precisely what the problem was with Charles C Johnson.

I have no problem with having contemptible people on the show. none.

HOWEVER..Joe needs to do a better job of pushing back if he's going to have outright bad people on his show. If he doesn't, then he stands out as someone who looks like they're condoning it. 




 minimize?

hersch has done good work here, but you're acting like you learned a significant amount of information for that 10,000 word article.

Again...what changed here?

The SEALs didn't get into a massive shootout?

OBL didn't have a gun on him?

So?  




  That's a silly argument: up until very recently, "Western values" were decidedly anti-gay.

I didn't make it up

You have to understand this.

Gays and gay rights are seen as intrusions of western values and virulently opposed. You have to remember how skeptical a lot of these places are to any sort of outside influence, especially culturally at this point. ***To them***, being anti-gay is a positive aspect of their society. 


Because they've been taught to feel that. People who are raised without the hatred, who have gay couples in their lives, do not feel "viscerally uneasy" in the slightest. The idea that people are born with hatred or "disgust" for same-sex interactions is utterly absurd.

I didn't say they were or were not taught anything. I'm telling how things are in different parts of the world.

You're not going to get anywhere by just thinking hitting over the head with your value systems will work without understanding why they're so stubborn to listen to you in the first place. So yeah, a lot of straight people aren't just drawn to images of gay people "being gay"...No matter how many gay people they have in their family or interact with. This isn't even about tolerance. Its about things you see that bother you. And a lot these cultures haven't had the references to understand how to view things they disagree with without respectfully disagreeing with it. Their answer is brutal repression and not tact or tolerance. Tolerance isn't something you find in 3rd world countries who can't even find the tolerance to fix their communities and solve overarching problems.  




 It doesn't run any "counter story"

It says the government struggled coming up with the finer details they wanted to release and that pakistan may have known about the raid itself

Big whoop

This isn't even that big of a revelation...unless they said OBL died in 1999 or something 




 **Do you really not understand this?**

Step outside if the ivory tower of liberal academia and step into the real and visceral world outside of your 1st world trappings

These people just HATE gays. 

It has nothing to do with their insecurity. It has everything to do with religiosity and flat out disgust of gay people

Hell, most heterosexual people I know don't *love* gays...they tolerate them in the sense that "it doesn't bother me" and they don't want them to be persecuted. Most heterosexuals I know just generally ignore it. But that doesn't mean they enjoy watching two dudes kiss or anything. It does viscerally make people feel uneasy. But thats besides the point. 

We're talking about cultures that haven't even secure the basics yet in the modern world...that are hyper-masculine (as a function of survival) and see any threat to the masculinity and thus perceived strength of their people as an utter and vile threat to the greater good. 

This has NOTHING to do with secretly being gay.

This has NOTHING to do with being insecure with your sexuality. 

Theres a reason the world map looks like this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory

Most of the world really does not value western ideals and rejecting homosexuals is seen as tossing off the weight of "liberalism" and "secularism" in these very traditional and insular cultures and communities.

Does this mean you have to agree?

No.

But it DOES mean that you'll have to do A LOT better in coming up with quick one-word responses to anything a "homophobe" (and gays need a better word than homophobe to be honest) has to say with respect to gay rights.  




  If you define islam by its extremists, then yes, it is islam.

What informs the extremists beliefs? 

I can't hand you a physics book and ask you to be a *moderate* about it 




  I ask why and he tells me because it is only "gay" if you are the one receiving or fall in love with the man. 

Thats fascinating  




 Same with Russia now 




 Actually, its not.

People just actually hate gays...and they don't see it as it having no effect on their lives. They see it as something they reject and want to not have to deal with it. I'm not a homophobe or anything so this doesn't bother me, but if you don't understand how they think or why they think it, you'll forever be confused. 

There are lazy arguments about AIDS and pedophilia and general visual discomfort in viewing gays in public that pervade all anti-gay societies around the world

Not every person who hates gays craves gay sex. Its stupid to even think that.  




 Did you even read Seymour's article?

We're bickering over stuff that isn't even that big of a deal!

OK. How many people were in the room? How many bullets we're fired? Did Pakistan know or not?

Who cares?

1. A raid happened

2. Bin Laden Died

3. US Intel led up the manner

The gist of the story is still the same. 









 Honestly, these "lies" aren't even lies.

I don't even see what the big deal is 




 So? 




 Yet this hasn't even come out. So whats really the big deal?

Clearly the Seal team had some answers for us since they had a convenient accident a short time later.


SEAL Teams have hundreds of members and train all the time.  




 Actually, the details aren't even that different.

Calling it a "lie" is ridiculous.

We're just discussing the color of the tablecloth at this point 




 Fabulous  




 OR...he just hates gays. 

You gotta stop thinking people who hate gays secretly crave penis 




 **We should abandon this notion that anyone who hates gays is therefore secretly gay**.

Is it true in many cases? Absolutely.

But there is a culture within Africa and ex-colonial states around the world (partly due to colonialism) that views western social values as vestiges of oppression and colonialism and emasculation...and anti-homosexuality is seen as an effort to regain a sense of confidence and stability in society. I  have heard the arguments too ranging from "The greeks brought homosexuality to africa" and "gays keep AIDS around" and the very common "gays aren't real men"...and you have to understand that these are just people who are trying to deal with the basics in life (the average citizen) and having to then conform to these notions of gender and try to maintain a degree of tolerance while doing so is VERY difficult. 

I'm not saying its right, but you have to understand this. It goes far beyond secretly "hating yourself"  




 The same one that used to stop black progress? 




 I'm just as much a nihilist as you...but really?

You might as well criticize how money works...or anything really. 
























 Its so funny when data comes out the way you don't like it, then it must be some OTHER cause.

Black men have been dumped on by the US in extraordinary ways and it seems Reddit can't handle it 














  the CIA/federal government wasn't exactly interested in upholding global white supremacy. 

LOL

Do you KNOW who J Edgar is? 




 Do you not know what the beef between allopathy and osteopathy is? 




 Do you want to ignore how racist the US has been?

Then pretend its not a factor? 




 You're really naive.  




 Deepak Chopra is hiring 









  transcendent minds.

This phase isn't going to help you win this discussion  




 Just 2 inches at a time bro. Everyone does it 

 #3232;_ #3232; 




 Its LITERALLY the same thing 




 what whistle was blown here?  














 Just look at some of the blog posts on there.

This guy is insane 









 You might as well just pick up some random snacks at your local drug store 




 Would him being 78 have something to do with it?

I'm sensing a bit of a Linus Pauling syndrom here... 




 *This spring I contacted Durrani and told him in detail what I had learned about the bin Laden assault from American sources: that bin Laden had been a prisoner of the ISI at the Abbottabad compound since 2006; that Kayani and Pasha knew of the raid in advance and had made sure that the two helicopters delivering the Seals to Abbottabad could cross Pakistani airspace without triggering any alarms; that the CIA did not learn of bin Ladens whereabouts by tracking his couriers, as the White House has claimed since May 2011, but from a former senior Pakistani intelligence officer who betrayed the secret in return for much of the $25 million reward offered by the US, and that, while Obama did order the raid and the Seal team did carry it out, many other aspects of the administrations account were false.*


#So whats the problem here?  














 Why wouldn't they be? Do you think the internet is just for non-government employees? 




 See...I trust them on foreign issues...but domestically I just laugh.  




 This is gonna get REAL interesting... 









 Yes.

Wtf is going on? 




 Except, it didn't

Zimmerman picked a fight. 

Lost

Then shot the guy kicking his ass.  




 Lets ask Trayvon... 




 I don't understand how you look at yourself in the mirror and think zimmerman's story holds up that travyon attacked him 




 Theres no evidence he was ambushed outside of him starting whatever fight that occurred.

No teenage boy I know who is on the phone with a girl making a run to the corner store will stop to engage in fisticuffs.  




 Thug?

You mean Zimmerman? 




 This is precisely why I truly believe Trayvon did NOT start that damn fight. It makes no sense.

Yes. Zimmerman lost that fight initially and shot Trayvon...but I've never seen a situation like this before.  




 Where are their fathers? 




 Putin's gonna ice this dude 




 anything in the city is consistently minimum 250/night

Unless you want to shack up in either a 4-star hotel asking 300+/night or end up on a ring highway  




 Thugs. 




 I mean...REALLY? 

Is demand that high or do you just love gouging people for the hell of it?

 









 Go.  




 I hope everyone would already know this 




 Could easily be a book or movie 







































 Yep. This is how Tamir Rice got killed. 




 This is precisely how/why Tamir Rice got killed 




 he's apparently really active still. He was the one who revealed Apple and Google were recording location data 5 years ago 




 The hacker is the one behind: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samy_(computer_worm) 














 BTW before this video was released, the friends of the man who got shot was a victim...not the perpetrator 

https://youtu.be/pBso7E__Y68

They lied about EVERYTHING 









 Theres 1.5 billion muslims 




 Nice statistically insignificant anecdote 




  There are sects of Islam where effigies of Mohammad are fine

name one. 




 Understatement 




 Do they not have any Persian art? 














 Redban. Is. An. Idiot. 




 Great Episode 









 It DID however put one suspect on probation for trying to go to a terrorist training camp 5 years ago.

You can't arrest someone with pre-crime e.g. "you're going to jail because we think you'll try and kill infidels 5 years from now" 




 Why isn't it possible for ISIS to have done this?

1. muslims get mad at mohammed pics

2. young angry muslims see whats going on online and want to join in

3. just so happens one of the suspects was being tracked by the feds for trying to go to an overseas camp.... 




 The NSA is getting so saturated with data that it's become useless for actually stopping, avoiding and lowering the essential reason it was created for: terrorism/acts of violence in America.

This isn't true.

See, predicting crime is hard unless you truly catch someone in the act. In Texas last week, the problem was that one of the suspects was already on probation essentially for being tracked to going overseas to train at a camp...but you can't arrest someone for suspicion of committing an terrorist act in the future.  




 ISIS as an islamic jihadist mindset predicates itself on worldwide domination

By asserting that they're "present" it helps them recruit.  




 How is this a conspiracy? Is it unreasonable young angry muslim men  live in the US? 









  How much would that cost?

Doesn't matter. 









 Sure 




 Ask it to tell you which planes are overhead  




 How is he wrong?

These young men aren't posting benign content to their Facebook pages.  




 Wouldn't it save us SO much more in the long run just to send a message of unity and progress and remove all of these bureaucratic barriers if we didn't have to focus on these meaningless boundaries? 




 Its SO frustrating.

ATL could AT LEAST resemble Boston. DC if we were ambitious. 

But no.

They CONTINUALLY stand in the way of literal progress in the metro area. 

This is why I suggest ATL just cannibalize everything inside 285 and be done with it.  




 It was supposed to go out to freaking GRIFFIN

 




 The Hawks are arguably the most innovative in the league in terms of fan -experience 









 He probably helped build a few of them 




 See, this is why NO policy changes are made.

None.  









 This is HARD! 




 Brilliant 









 You can't really blame him. Thats what consulting and private equity tends to do. 




 Sounds like Mitt Romney 




  I should have the right to do any drug I damn well please as long as doing so doesn't effect anyone else. 

drug use, regardless has absolute public health implications  




 He's cleaned up the streets though. His record doesn't lie.  




 People wouldn't poke fun if muslims weren't so quick to get mad 




 What is islamophobia?
