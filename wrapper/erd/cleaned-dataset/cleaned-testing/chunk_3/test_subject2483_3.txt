 Why do you say so?  




 Wtf motherland calls ought to be a wonder! 




 Droidippy mate! 




 Thanks, an excellent explanation. For some reason I'm more familiar with the last terms than the first ones :p You're amazing thanks! 




 No one mentioned the intelligent investor? 




 From house of cards, "the anti-nuclear argument is purely emotional, with no rationale or logic supporting it".
I'm paraphrasing. 




 Vive la France! :D 




 Should be similar as to like total war (where different rates of taxation earn you money, but stifle food, science, happiness).
But similarly, economics in civ has always been non-existant. So much more could be added. 




 Could someone please explain what that means? The language is a bit too complicated for a mere mortal like me..  :'( 




 LifeLad 




 Amazing answer, but could you please explain the first paragraph (standard deviation part). Learning it in my math lessons and would love to understand how it links to this situation.  




 "There is risk that our increasingly communist government will confiscate everything in sight. " LOL

 




 Can you explain in more detail please? 




 Holy f*ck what an amazing answer. I only understood like 30% of what you said, but wow, thanks so much! I will dive into all the things you talked about to try and formulate some sort of educates respons, but can you start by telling me what is kurtosis? That ks so much! 




 SL. Thought of going up, but was too late. Get 90%+ in all tests. 




 Hey r/investing!
I have to write a mathematics essay (Math Internal Assessment for the IB), and at the moment I am trying to formulate a question. Since the stock market is very interesting, I was curious, what mathematics is used to "predict" share price movements. Any relatively complex maths is enough, even if it is completely wrong (I assume many mathematics formulaes, etc. in predicting the stock market are wrong). Any help would be helpful! Thanks so much! 




 Just shows the new lows Russia has reached. Being a Russian, it hurts :'( 




 I don't know about most, but nuking is certainly up there :D 




 even to (any country) in "x years" the (country) would look alien in "x years +400). Go an read more about the actual religion and culture the (country) and people dressed and what they did for fun and compare that to (country) during the days of (any leader in year year x). It is a continuation but it changed more that enough to be called a different.

I suggest France as a good country. But can apply to pretty much any country. Not trying to argue here, just pointing out that this argument you put forward can be applied to almost any country. 




 I thought I was going to have an amazing well argued response that will change my view for the better and open up a new world in investing for me. Pity all I got is you seeing HR... :D 




 Please don't down vote, imagine its moronic Monday. Why is this statement bad? Sure, the NIKKEI and others have remained stagnant for long times, but most have increased. Over a life time (I'm 17), isn't that good advice? Sorry for any stupidity, CMV. 




 Thank you so much :) 




 Why can't we be proud of being terran? Its like, if a race wins, it has to be putten down. Terran master race, haters gonna hate.
