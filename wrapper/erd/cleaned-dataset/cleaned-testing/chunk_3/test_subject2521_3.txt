 Thank you and I'm glad to see you have taken those extra steps, in life, to ensure your safety, as well as others!  




 I know all to well what you are talking about and find it quite unfortunate that Brownback (and the Koch brothers) have chosen this route. 

After serving an AmeriCorps term and working at Harvesters - Community Food Network, I have had first hand experience working with families in need. With all the govt. shutdown nonsense affecting recipients of WIC, this will only create more problems for these families and the life and well-being of (KS) citizens. 



 









 Neither do a lot of college students. Though that's due to ignorance, more so than zero awareness.  




 Surprised no one has mentioned contraceptives. Isn't that one of the basic reasons Republicans wouldn't accept the Affordable Care Act (or at least it was highly publicized as a reason)? Seems ridiculous but then again, they also think it's necessary to accept rape.

Ok so that went from funny to sad, I do apologize. But only to non-Republicans. Otherwise you guys suck, and by suck, I mean your own balls. 
 




 Wow, based on the original post, I wasn't expecting such harsh criticism. 

It is great to see a 'sneaky frat guy' actually showed respect for a drunken female. This DOES NOT mean all frat guys behave the same way. I've had my fair share of run ins with college douchebags, so I know.

As so, I have respect for this individual - - not all frat guys.

Oh and my brother is an alumni of a fraternity, so I have respect for those I know are actual gentleman.

Edit: Corrected a typo. 




 Finally have some sense of respect for frat guys. Let me emphasize some, not all. 


 




 Wow, that was one nostalgic moment! I'd sit in my Dad's office for hours playing this - PC version.  




 Abe   Jake's closed, Quintons must have gotten old and Fatsos might have the same turnout. That leaves all the hipster bars on Mass. Sadly, they chose Jazzhaus as their new mating grounds.  




 All the cool bartenders left, karaoke night turned into a group of frat boys screaming to a song on stage (not just during the summer), plus the quality of drinks changed, too. If you can't make a proper martini, don't work at the Jazzhaus. 

Ahhh back in the day. Oh wait, that was only a few years ago. 

 




 Jazzhaus use to be cool, now it's 'bro central'.  




 My first camping trip was at Woodridge! Can't wait go camping again and this time around, we'll be sure to collect more wood for the fire!!
 




 Ok so, maybe nerve-wracking wasn't the best word choice, but it is quite annoying!  




 We're backwards in these here states.


Will admit though, it's quite nerve-wracking when reading a date and not realizing the switch. 




 Didn't know any famous people, directly, but went to school for a few years with Kristie Alleys' niece and Kevin Bacons' brother/cousin was a teacher and coach at my high school. I'm not sure of the exact relationship, but he looked a lot like Kevin - almost identical.  




 Am I the only one who can't access the entire story? So far I can only read through Part 2: The Dangers. 

Otherwise the browser won't respond. Not sure if it was a problem with my laptop or Reuters' site. 

 




 With most inserted objects (graphs, pics, etc), you must select the object and change its layout on the page. 

It's not Microsoft Word, you just do not understand how to use it. 




 Your cat is doing that out of pure enjoyment/pleasure. It's not the same for the other kitty;  poor thing is scared!  




 The finished dish smells a lot like a pizza and tastes like a lasagna; with a quiche texture and a crust.

 














 That's why they built White House | Black Market. If shoes aren't enough, over-priced clothes will do.  




 Bros don't mate naturally, they use roofies.  




 That's what makes this such a great recipe! It doesn't relate - 100% - b/c the rice isn't prepared separately. But a pan isn't wasted b/c the rice is prepared along with the stock (vegetable or chicken), spices, onions, and tomatoes.

 Here are two sites you might want to check out:

1.  Migraine Associated Vertigo (MAV) 
(http://vestibular.org/migraine-associated-vertigo-mav).

2. Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) (http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/specialty_areas/vestibular/conditions/benign_paroxysmal_positional_vertigo.html)


From March 2008-July 2013 I was misdiagnosed as having Menieres. After receiving little assistance from my ENT, I decided to try and manage my dizziness on my own. This was quite a challenge given the fact I still didnt understand why I was dizzy.

Within the past year I decided I wanted to get rid of, or at least try to treat, this problem. After doing a lot of research for specialists in my area, I came across an Audiologist not far from here. After the first round of testing, my previous diagnosis turned out to be wrong. Through these tests alone, it was determined that I had Migraine Associated Vertigo (MAV). Coincidentally I suffered from chronic migraines (diagnosed as depression) throughout high school (Sophomore - Senior year) and had a few years of 'relaxation' (3 years) until the vertigo spells started. The culprit? ***STRESS*** 

After coming to this conclusion, I still had to take into consideration that once I started having dizzy spells, I too lost the ability (equilibrium wise) to play sports, run, dance, etc. My life went from being a fun, energetic college student, to a recluse. I could no longer stand this and spoke to my Audiologist about this very problem. He introduced me to the Vestibular Therapist in the office and after only a months work, Im no longer dizzy and my ears stopped ringing (experienced Tinnitus 24 a day/ 7 days a week for the past 5+ years). If my ears start to ring, its usually a sign that my bodys telling me to stop, and relax.  




 If you happen to have another cat, this breed tends to be territorial. Found this out after watching a few episodes of 'My Cat from Hell', and my mom just assumed it couldn't be fixed. Unforunately, it would have been an easy thing to do- had I only known at the time. She made me get rid of Bella after having her for only 2 years.

But..on to the good stuff:

Such a great breed, especially if you're in the mood for a playful, energetic and lovable kitty! Congrats!! :-D


 




 Looking at the cats eyes and how she digs her claws into the carpet, it's a clear sign she's terrified and trying to protect her kitten and not acting cute. 

Is it worth an 'aww'? Perhaps...but I still feel sorry for the cat.  




 Say hello to the 'Persian Death Stare'.  




 Thai Siam is great - instead of getting the usual Zen Zero or Encore. 

Merc deli is great (and Ingredient, too), but a bit on the pricey side. Same with Wheatfields, but their sandwiches are to die for! 

If she's in the mood for Falafel (restaurant opened by an owner of the Hookah House) be sure to check out Lebanese Flower on Mass St. They also serve hummus and other great food!  




 Watch episodes of The French Chef...she teaches you how to properly chop, cut, dice, etc.


Oh and the key to not crying - - make sure your knife is sharp!  




 If I recall correctly, she's a Blue Tabby Persian - but without all the hair!  









 No prob! :-) 




 It's a normal thing for Persian cats. They always get gooey stuff in their eyes! Perks for having a flat face....

 Oh yeah, should have mentioned that:

Soak the amount for 30min in cold water and be sure to rinse through. 

We used dried Shiitake mushroom that were already chopped up, but still had to remove a few stems from the reconstitutes mushrooms.

The dish is topped with flat-leaf parsley and parmesan cheese.  




 I'll post the recipe tomorrow! :-) 









 Knowing the characteristics of breeds helps keep incidents like this from happening. He's clearly a breed that loves affection and requires maintenance - grooming.

I have a pure-bred Persian. She's adorable as hell, but lacking in personality and requires daily grooming. It's what you typically expect from the breed. 




 There are several stores about an hour from where I live. I've thought about stopping by, but I figured it would work best to receive tips via Reddit, before going. Would definitely give me a clearer idea of where to start  shades, products, etc. 

Not to mention, I could call ahead to see if they even carry the product. Last thing I would want to do is drive there and not be find what I need! 



















 I've thought about permanent brows, but I'll need to do more research before commiting to something like that. As for the scar, most people don't...it's more of the reason why I wore makeup in the first place, so it continues to a main focus. Thanks for your tips!  




 Ahh yes, fine words  once shared by Jenna Marbles! I'm trying not to be such a perfectionist when drawing them out - just need to follow such words of advice! :-) 




 Thank you for your tips! I'll be sure to check out MAC products! :-)
 




 Wow, thanks! Those actually look a lot like my 'natural' brow. But not as thick! I'll be sure to check out the tutorials and products. Thanks!  




 Thank you so much for your post. And yes, it made me smile! I like knowing when someone else has a clearer idea of where I'm coming from!  




 I tried using Anastasia but always had problems getting my brows to match. Since everyone keeps suggesting the product, I might go ahead and try it again. 

Thank you! :-) 




 I've allllllways worn lipglosses and the like, but I wanted to look more 'grown up'. I'm the size of a kid (i.e. under 5ft) and looking older, helps out a lot!  




 This is when scaring becomes an issue. I've spoke and met with the surgeon I've used since I was a child, and scaring (on the left side) makes doing that, difficult. Not to mention I'm 'supposed' to get brow lifts to compensate for the lack of (normal) tissue on the left side of my face. Lol wow I know that probably came as a surprise! My situation is just too darn complicated! :-P BUT I still thank you for your advice!  




 Wow, I can't believe the number of replies! I really appreciate everyone's comments and will do what I can to reply over the next fee days! Thank you so much! :-) 




 I use a neutral concealer and a natural lite liquid fondation, but I'll be sure to try brighter lipsticks/lip glosses! Thank you! :-) 




 lol sorry. That wouldn't be the first time I got it wrong. Thanks for clearly that one up!  




 Oh eyebrows...once upon a time I had great eyebrows. Nice thickness and shape, but I was in high school and getting your eyebrows waxed was cool. So I went in and she took off too much - and well---- they never grew back (on both sides). On the left side (in the before picture) all visible brow was medically inserted years ago, to ensure I still somewhat had an eyebrow. It worked, for the most part, but transplanting hair (from say your head) to your face, it doesn't grow like facial hair....at all. Drawing them on hasn't been a great experience b/c I use to draw on a brown line and thought that would suffice. No wonder I received a lot of stares. Now I have a better idea of how they should look, just do not know how to go about drawing them! 




 OMG thank you for mentioning the winged eyeliner! I never could figure out how people did that! 

I'll be sure to look more into that, as well as the lipsticks! :-) 




 I've thought about using vibrant colors - such as purple - but always dreaded the idea of buying makeup that wouldn't be used! Thanks for the tip! :-) 




 I tried stenciles, but couldnt get the brows to match - height, shape, etc. Due in part to the scaring. I just trace the area out with an eyebrow pencil and fill it in with brown eyeshadows. Just using what I've had to get by!  




 Due to my skin tone, I can't find a color that really fits. Anything too dark or too light makes it the only thing you see, or directs attention to my eyes. It's quite a challenge...


I know, I know..then try something in-between. I have, and it's still overpowering :-/ 




 I've watched Youtube videos, and the like, for eyebrow tutorials, but it's easier said than done. Scaring makes drawing them on quite a challenge! I'll have a correct arch and shape (for my right eyebrow) but can't figure out how to replicate that for the left side. Have any tips?


Scaring certainly makes me self-conscious and I have even looked in to Dermabrasion, but it won't work the same for me as for others. Due to thinner skin (i.e. skin graft) plus missing bone tissue, muscle, etc, hiding such scars is quite a challenge.

Thank you for your kind words of advice! :-)
 




 When dealing with blush, I either can't see it or it's too overpowering. Can't seem to find a brand that compliments my skin tone. 

Eyeshadow is quite a bit different. As you can see, I have scaring above my left eye. More so, my entire eyelid consists of a skin graft. This makes applying eye makeup to be quite a challenge. Especially when I want to do something colorful and creative. Sorry, I should have made that problem more clear from the start. 




 Cellphone pics are quite a challenge when smiling! Spent close to 20min trying to take the before and after pics. Since there's a lot of scaring, by not smiling, you're able to see what I'm working with a little better. 

Lip color - ugh, that's a whole new challenge. I like light colors (i.e light pink, light bronze, just a shimmer, etc.) By not working much with lipsticks, etc. I haven't found a color that matches well. Or I find that it's too overpowering. 


Thanks for your tip! :-) 




 I've tried darks and lights (hair color) but never seem to know what to do with my overall makeup. Even tried dirty-blonde-streaks back in high school, and to be honest, it looked ridiculous. I also knew very little about makeup, so that's possibly a reason. 

lol I even owned a bronzer brush and whatever else, but never figured out how to use it (no one would ever show me!!!!). I also use primer - thanks in part to my boyfriend's advice, and it does help quite a bit! 

Thanks for your tips! :-) 




 Thank you for letting me know! Since there isn't a 'makeup advice' subreddit, I wasn't sure where to post!

 My story:


I was hit by a car when I was a child (3 years of age - 1989 to give you a better idea of the time). Following the accident, I was both mentally and physically impaired. Both of which were apparent to the average person. As so I sought help via plastic surgery (and education...but that's another story). That is a lot to go through as a child and I am doing whatever possible to not seek help from that 'source of perfection'.


That is why I am here.


As you can see, I am rather pale, must draw on eyebrows, and the like, on a daily basis. No matter what I do, I cannot retain much color to my face. Over the past few months, I have experimented with different eye shadows and blush, but nothing seems to work. Also considered changing my hair color, but brown eyes make pairing quite a challenge. (i.e. I LOVE the woman's hair in the Wendy's commercials, but she also has blue eyes, so I'm not so sure if it would work.)


If you have any advice, please feel free to share!

Edit 2: Do not fret! I am currently reading through posts and seeing what I can do! This will surely require taking a trip to the mall, but I will use your tips, and fill everyone in on what works! Thank You so much, again! I truly appreciate it! :-)

 Thank you so much! :-) 




 Thank you so much for sharing! I will definitely try it sometime soon!
Do you happen to know of a good recipe? If not, that's fine. Just thought I'd ask before searching! :-) 




 Thanks for providing me another reason to fear wasps - wasp invasion!!!! 




 We stored some in the fridge and fry up 2/3 cup, or so, when we want another. Quick, easy, and delicious!  




 Haha I wondered if someone was going to ask that. It's quite savory, but you're more than welcome to add something sweet. Actually think my boyfriend did that for lunch! 


Edit: yeah I'm not too sure about adding maple syrup. It's too savory of a pancake. It's served with a Tahini Sauce but you have to like sesame seeds.  




 Tip:

Oh and only make what you plan to eat. Not as great when reheated.


Also, if you are wondering about the taste. I'm horrible at describing these things, but the main flavors are curry and garlic. If you're familiar with Middle Eastern food, you'll have a clearer idea of this. I had someone ask and figured other people might wonder the same.

 Lol it's ok. I just find it odd a lot of people consider vegetarians/vegans to be weird/ not normal. It isn't mainstream in the US, as compared to other regions of the world, but it still is quite popular. Plus, this helps show that we eat more than just salads! :-)

 Whoa there, normal eater? I'll let that one slide......

 Where's the SRS when you need them...... 




 That's a first for me. Quite intrigued.... 




 I thought about using a zip tie but couldn't figure out how to attach it  




 There's a bundle inside the shelf that attaches to one end on the wall and the bundle shown does the same for the right side. I was unable to attach both ends from inside the shelf. It allows for great support! I'll be sure to look in to changing the tape. We use it often, so we'll notice if it starts to give! Thanks for the tip!  




 Her eyes get like that throughout the day. Would have cleaned them, but I didn't want to make her mad.
