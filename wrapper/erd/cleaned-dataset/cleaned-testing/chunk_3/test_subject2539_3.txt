 This might be his masterpiece, but Se7en is still my favorite. Zodiac has a limited number of rewatches, Se7en I can watch whenever. 




 Ok I'm sorry 




 No wonder so many Leon medical centers have sprung up lately 




 Gonna read this. Had never heard of it. 




 I like to imagine the setting myself. Unless its incredibly important to the story, can't the reader just infer from the situation where the  characters are? 




 I read The Road this year after having attempted it a couple years ago. I loved it. I don't know if to read Blood Meridian or No Country For Old Men because Ive already seen the movie. How similair is it to the movie? 




 c-cc-c-c-c-c-c-cccombo breaker. Shits not chill at all 




 Link? 




 Yea, only drink I get when I go there. 




 The book was. Idk about the adaption. 




 No, a major plot point is that hes getting older, so I would recommend watching it at least a week after the others. Preferably three years after. 




 Fun fact, Quantum of Solace is the most expensive film ever by the  minute. It was just a really expensive epilogue to Casino Royale.
edit. wrong word 




 Cats Cradle is my favorite of his, followed by Sirens of Titan.  




 Michael Chabon "Wonder Boys" enjoying it a lot.
Ernest Hemmingway "Farewell to Arms", taking my time with this one, perfect breakfast reading. 




 He runs a Nazi memorabilia shop. 




 Manhattan Love Story is surprisingly enjoyable and clever. 




 New Girl is hilarious, at least the first two seasons. You're just hating. 









 Your kid wins at Halloween 




 Literally watching "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" right now and I'm loving it. 




 Brad Bird outweighs Lindelof though, so who cares. 




 Holy shit me too. I was 12 or 13 and I had just got a TV in my room, I channel surfed until I hit upon HBO and a movie was about to start. I said why not, and Collateral happened. It was my favorite movie for a long time. 




 You speak Arabic? Sounds like you can definitely get a good job 




 You already saw the whole joke. 




 I've been in six car accidents! Two ended up completely wrecking the car I was in.


Only four where my fault. 




 Just graduate. Senior year is young adult day care 




 I was so glad when the detailer gave me the option for AG. Forgot about tuition assistance... 




 I'm in DEP for Aerographers Mate, shipping out in 2015. Wondering what exactly goes down in the Navy when on shore duty. Everything on the internet is usually about sea duty. 




 Its the online sf86 




 I live in his home area, I hate how fucking thug and ignorant people can be down here. Career criminals are the worst, and more needs to be done in this country to help youths make better decisions. 




 High Grossers: Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson etc


Grown Ups cast: Adam Sandler, Cris Rock, Rob Schneider etc

New SNL cast: Andy Samberg, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Jason Sudeikis, Kristen Wiig etc


Appatow crew: Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, James Franco etc


Did I miss any? Who's your favorite? 




 Buy an ereader.

I have a Kindle Paperwhite and I now read 5 times more books. 




 Sirens of Titan and CatS Cradle are my favorites. Mother Night is my least favorite. 




 "Horns" by Joe Hill. I read "Heart Shaped Box" last week and enjoyed it very much so now I have to read his whole bibliography. I like that he seems to have grown up with the same pop culture I did, so I understand all the reference's he makes. Liking his style more than Kings. 




 I've seen The Mexican on TBS like 4 times in the last ten years. 




 Reddits not a waste of time though. Think of it as a free MMO community college with courses on any topic and where anyone can be teacher or student. If you reddit correctly you can learn a lot of stuff for free. 




 On a dead celebrity binge? 




 If you like Gone Girl you might as well read her two other novels, Sharp Objects and Dark Places. Both have female protagonists that seem real. 




 Do you recommend ET to someone who's never worked with electronics before?  




 Dark Places was good too 




 The Road. Its narrative and strange word choice made 17 year old me give up quick, until four years later when i gave it a second shot. Finished it in one night. Amazing novel. 




 God yes. I was utterly destroyed when an ex of mine three days after breaking up with me showed up on my feed as in a relationship. 




 Whenever a server asks me how much creme or sugar and I say none, I try to keep the coolest face I can


"look at that guy, he's a real man, not afraid of anything" 




 Black because I like tasting the coffee and not the creme.

Also, because I hope someone notices and thinks its cool.
 




 That's not what it means.
Its how high you are, not how much you smoked. 




 Expendables 4 




 They already did with Casino Royale 




 I only had a small injury on one of my fingers, but it was years ago. Vision and hearing are great too, and I am in very great physical shape.


I really cant wait until I'm swore in. I think about it all day. This wait is stressing me out.

Positive thoughts. 




 I took my asvab yesterday, all I need is my physical and a drug waiver now. So am I basically in? I hope so, I've been stressing it a lot. 




 I was thinking Batista 




 Damn gurl you normmmall.  Nam sayin 




 It was necessary to make more money, which is what the film industry is about.  




 Read Sirens of Titan, what I believe Hitchhikers to be based off of. 




 Read this book throughout a road trip. Its like the only thing I remember from the trip.  




 So you bought 4 shares? 




 WAIT WE HAVE THIS TECHNOLOGY? 




 I also want to know. I can only afford one. 




 Was Bling Ring good? I'll Netflix it if it is 




 The one with legal murder. 




 The Road and The Stranger. Not because they were great, they were, but because they're really short. 




 When a friend of mine fell for a pyramid scheme and knew it. His reasoning was that he knew he could make it to the top of the scheme if he signed other people up.
