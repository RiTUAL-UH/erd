 I've been trying to, and I think it's actually helping. 




 Wow thank you a+ you win 




 Hello, I need help figuring out how to become more social. I know that lots of people just aren't social and that's okay, but it sucks always feeling left out because I'm too scared to talk to anyone. I'm a 15 year old girl, and even from a young age I've never been able to talk to other kids. I have a few really close friends that I can talk to easily, but with everyone else, it's a lost cause. Sometimes when I really want to say something to someone that I don't know well, I'll count to 10 and say it, but it always comes out in awkward stutters. I think my problem is that people will think I'm weird or they don't like me. Online, I'm able to talk to you guys super easily, but if we were face-to-face it would be all kinds of awkward. I know that everyone thinks I'm really nerdy, because I'm in marching band and get really good grades. Even in marching band though, I can only talk to a select few people. I always feel left out from the group, and it kind of sucks, because everyone else is so close. Do you guys have any tips that could help me with my social awkwardness? Because I can't take it anymore. 




 Woo!

 I know, it just sucks feeling like the weird ugly friend 




 Yes, my best friend in the world is beautiful, lost about 75 pounds, always has guys all over her, has been in a relationship for almost 2 years, and is really good at making friends. I feel so inferior around her. 




 Thank you! 




 8.5/10 could cuddle eternally

 *hug*3 




 Awh sure 3 pm me? :) 




 Just a rough break up 




 Jesus Christ  




 We don't really compete, we just do football games and invitationals and festival. We got a 1 at festival though so that's good 




 Euph in concert and marching band, and trombone in jazz  




 I'm Anna, and I need more friends. I like kittens, puppies, music, and sleeping. I play euphonium and trombone in band, and you should pm me c: 




 WOW WHO ARE YOU 




 Sounds fun :3 I'm Anna, I'm 15, from Michigan, a sophomore in high school, had a shitty day, and I enjoy marching band, cats, puppies, and not leaving the house all weekend. 




 You're in marching band so you're automatically perfect tbh 




 I want a watercolor tattoo. I think something abstract would be cool. I'd like it on my wrist, shoulder, or shoulder blade. 




 This made me cringe more than the actual post 




 They do, they're so loyal and I love the energy at the games. 




 Waterford resident  




 So do I. I joke about it too but it gets old when people constantly tell you about how much it sucks where you live when they've never even been there. 




 I messaged you 




 They're gorgeous but they have a lot of problems. The middle clave on mine is really sticky and gets jammed a lot and everyone in my section has at least one major issue with theirs. I'll message you though since I feel like we're spamming this post haha 




 Really? That's funny. How come you're jealous of our euphs? 




 OH MY GOD YOU GUYS ARE GREAT. We were at your invitational last month and you were fantastic and I'm so jealous. What do you play? 




 Yup! Are you in a Michigan band? 




 Band: Waterford Kettering Marching Captains

Instrument: Euphonium

Show Name: Music Royale

Repertoire: Bicycle Race by Queen, Hit the Road Jack by Ray Charles, King Kong by Jimmy Castor, Hall of the Mountain King

Unfortunately, as you can probably tell, we don't compete and we're a show band. We just go to invitationals, festivals, and play at parades and football games. We are a very good band though. Straight 1's at festival for the past three years, we got first place from 150 bands at the Mackinaw City memorial day parade, and we're going to be in the Detroit Thanksgiving Day Parade on national television. Last time we went there we got first. I wish we competed though tbh. 




 Well I don't blame him for getting mad at the professor if he was unprofessional when the question was asked. Of course the slurs weren't necessary but this honestly isn't that cringey 




 My boyfriend has one of these. The damn thing makes me so uncomfortable. 




 There were a bunch of teenage girls doing this exact same thing at the Jason Mraz concert I went to 




 My boyfriend has a body pillow of a female anime character (I have no idea which one) and damn that thing makes me uncomfortable.  




 He said "I'm glad the bitch is dead." 




 Shit like this kind of makes me ashamed to be a feminist 




 What the hell? 




 My best friend's sister is at Grand Valley State and was actually doing this last night... AND took Facebook pictures 




 I don't know why you're getting down voted... 




 Sometimes I hate my state. 




 Yup, that's it! Thank you! 









 Well I don't know what I expected. 




 Air bags are so dangerous. My mom is 4'11 and she would get so injured if the airbag came out. It makes me so worried. 




 Idek I actually really like that family 









 Wow that actually made me really sad. I've had a crush on McCrae since day 1 tbh 




 I honestly would love to see McCrae win veto. He could be such a strong player if it weren't for Amanda. 




 Agreed. 




 Did he really? He blocked me because he threatened suicide for like the 5th time, and I knew he was bluffing, so I messaged his aunt and he hates me now 




 OMG IS THIS ALEX PLEASE TELL ME IT IS I HAVE SO MANY STORIES ABOUT HIM 




 Oh my gosh I'm in Michigan too, and this year at the senior walk out in my school, and there was a group of like 5 kids all walking together in all camo, head to toe, and mumbling in fake southern accents. 




 Nah, just some parts. 




 ^ Same 




 That fact wasn't fun at all! 




 Who said the original quote?  




 I saw a kid do that in elementary school. He just got really bad whiplash. 




 So do I. Flint scares me tbh. 




 Wow that sounds like me in about 8th grade. Really that's creepy as hell, they even got the name, state, and "OMG CATSSS" right. Fuck. 




 Heaven forbid they aren't a Greek god! 




 As a large-ish girl who goes on Tumblr, this is true. Half the girls on there annoy me so much because they are so picky with guys, and when I say that I prefer chubby guys, some of my friends on tumblr act so confused. Because according to them, all kinds of guys are required to like all kinds of girls and have no say in it, but it's okay for them to talk about how gross bigger guys are. Some girls on there are so shallow, it's crazy.

 I will definitely check it out. I know what you mean when you talk about things that speak to you. It sounds great, and like it would help me a lot. Thank you so much for the suggestion. 




 That made me happy to read, you sound wonderful. Of course you can feel free to PM me anytime you want. It would be great to have a friend to relate to in that way, because I don't have any of those. Thank you for reading about me, and feel free to PM me. 




 That's exactly how I've been trying to handle it. I've accepted the fact that I'm not over him, but I don't let my friends say bad things about him anymore. I just try not to think about it. He goes to the other high school in my district, so I only see him occasionally at marching band competitions and invitationals. He told my friend that he wanted to get back together with me, but I realized that he would hurt me like that again, so I just didn't talk to him. But I definitely have been moving on and thinking about other guys, and that has helped me. It was rough, but it is getting a lot better. Thank you. 




 I am a teenage girl who has been dealing with depression and anxiety for about a year and a half. Cutting and suicidal thoughts are things I had issues with for a long time. Before I tell my story, I want to say that finding this, and looking at some of the posts, made me feel less alone. Feeling alone is all too familiar to everyone on this subreddit, and it's amazing that a group of people who are feeling the same things and battling the same things can come together to discuss and guide each other. That's beautiful.

Now for the my story. As a young child, I never fit in. I was always the weird fat girl, and living in a wealthy town full of girls with entitlement issues  didn't help. My mother is very down to Earth, and since it was only her and I living together, we didn't have much money. We were by no means poor, but I didn't live in a fancy house in a nice subdivision, nor did I wear designer brand clothes like all the other kids. My parents divorced when I was two, and my dad was in and out of prison. With all of this being said, I spent most of my time alone and playing by myself when I was little. I had no siblings and no friends to play with. 

Then when I was 10 or 11, about to start middle school, my mother made a spur of the moment decision to move to a town about 10 or 20 miles outside the one we were living in. I was not excited. There were some bad areas of the town, and it intimidated me. My mom tried to assure me that I'd make lots of new friends and that everyone would be nicer. I didn't believe her, because I believed that kids were mean, and that's just how it was. I had no idea that there really were nice kids out there. I started middle school and everything was well, and I was amazed when I wasn't made fun of on the first day. I was very introverted, and didn't have any friends until about halfway through the school year, when I started taking to Jessie, a beautiful trumpet player in my band class who I though was extremely cool. I am still friends with her today, and I met most of my other friends though the people that Jessie knew in elementary school. 6th and 7th grade were good, and while I wasn't popular, and was still "the weird fat girl" in some people's eyes, I had a group of friends that I loved. I was content. 

Then the summer before 8th grade, my father passed away due to a prescription drug overdose. I tried to avoid it, and pretend that it never happened, which only fueled my mourning. My father wasn't perfect, and there were points where I would only see him two or three times a year, but he loved me. He adored me. In the letters he sent to my the rest of my family, he never shut up about me. The thing that hurt me the most is that the last the we talked was on the phone, and I didn't tell him I loved him. As with all deaths, I mourned and then gradually moved on with my life. When 8th grade started, all was well, and I still had the same group of friends.

About halfway through the year, I developed a crush on a close friend, Brandon. He also came from a broken home, with a dead mother, an abusive father, and being in his grandparents' custody with his older brother. I told him, and in early March we started dating. I loved this boy. He was my first boyfriend, first kiss, and first everything. Being the naive young kid I was, we had sex. Because hey, if he's willing to have sex with me, that must mean he really loves me right? Well as you would expect, he broke up with me shortly afterwards, after coming on a vacation with my family and I for my birthday. About a week after my birthday, he randomly became very distant and would only talk to me briefly once every few days, where we used to FaceTime for hours and hours every day. Then one day I sent him a message and asked what was wrong, and after a short argument, he called me on FaceTime. He said he had to break up with me to "protect me" and we were both sobbing. I didn't hear from him for over a year. 

In all honesty, I never really got over him. I still have dreams about him on a nightly basis, and I think he was the thing that really fueled my depression. For once in my life, I felt a mutual love with one of my peers, and then it was gone. I now realize the he used me, and he was very controlling, but I loved him.  I spent weeks and weeks crying over the breakup, but of course, I started getting over it slowly but surely. That was my first experience with cutting. I was sad, and mad at myself, so I grabbed the dull knife from the kitchen and sawed at my arm until there was a swollen cut, with blood oozing out. It felt good. The physical pain distracted me from the mental pain, and for those moments, it relieved my stress. 

Through freshman year, cutting was an issue. I continued to earn good grades and smile, but in marching band, a close-knit group of friends, I felt like an outsider. Jessie made new upperclassmen friends, and I was the awkward weird girl who wouldn't talk to anyone. It got really bad in the winter, and those are when the thoughts got more hostile and I felt more alone. I began more and more to sit in my room alone and listen to music, and avoid everyone around me. It was the same routine at this point: wake up, go to school or pretend I was sick, then lay and bed and sulk. I began becoming anorexic, not eating for a couple days at a time. I have since gotten better with eating, although the thought still rises occasionally. I was put on Zoloft when I was 14 as well as attended therapy, and it helped for a while, but now I am falling back into that pit of loneliness. We quit therapy a few months ago because it became too much money for my mom to handle.

Being a teenager, I like to tell myself this is a phase, or a mere hormone imbalance, but at this point I know it's not. Nothing seems beautiful, and I can find sadness and despondence in most everything. I can't shake the lonely, worthless feeling constantly plaguing me, and I needed to tell my story to people who would understand and point me in the right direction. I really feel less alone now, and I can relate to so many of you. Thank you for reading this, and I look forward to being a supportive part of this subreddit. 




 I bet! John Mayer is great. I saw Jason Mraz last summer, and that was fantastic as well. 




 Nah, he wasn't here that I know of. I'm in Michigan. Did you? 




 Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I was leaning towards getting a ball python. Thanks c: 




 I'll keep that in mind, thanks! 




 I love Harmony Korine so much. Maybe I'm just a pretentious asshole, but I absolutely loved Gummo. It was so unsettling, I loved it.
