 I didn't see a single mention of the Seattle - Portland game on tonight, despite it being from the same family of networks in the same sport. No promotion, no commercials, nothing. Was this the same for everyone else? I live on the East Coast, so there may not have been any promotion because of that reason. Was it the same on the West Coast?
