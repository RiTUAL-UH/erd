 Thank you! Dear god yes 




 That nug looks like a sinusoidal wave. Anyone? 




 I have not tried this, nor do i have any experience with edibles, but I came up with this idea while I was really high. So what you would do is bake chocolate sauce with a bunch of kief and dip strawberries and bananas in the resulting sauce. Don't know if this would work... 




 Kudos to you, I'm way too stressed out during the week to want to do anything other than chill on a Friday. 




 Tax season keeps the o's rolling in 




 Sorry that had to happen to you friend. Some people just don't understand. 




 I don't vape because a vape is 170$+. Also bongs get you way higher than vapes. They are both different highs though. 




 Do you have any other reason for supporting this initiative other than "I don't like cigarette smoke, therefore nobody should be able to smoke anywhere on campus, because I live on campus"? Your opinion comes across as closed-minded and self-centered. 




 Just hold your breath. I don't smoke, but I still respect smokers' desire to be able to smoke outside. It's really not a big deal at all. Don't let it rustle your jimmies. 




 Toking up for you tonight. Good luck with life friend 




 Good stuff man i would attend 




 Being high opens your mind to new possibilities and helps you realize that everyone is just like you and that we should all respect one another. I speak from experience when i say that I am more mature and my mind is more open after i started smoking on occasion. You will also feel very happy and appreciate everything around you, like nature, much more as you realize life is the result of a complex set of interacting systems. Toke on, friend. 




 Honestly I never post, but I felt morally obligated to offer my condolences to any parties involved. :( 




 Just dropping in to say congrats, that was smooth as silk 




 I won't lie - the title almost made me downvote the content immediately. Then I noticed it wasn't a self-post. Then I read the attached article. Very well said. I need to work on how quickly I judge posts made on reddit... 




 College student, RA is never around, never make noise 




 It looks more like a joint to me. Needs moar weed. Good roll though 




 I'm not sure I fully understand. Can't you just declare the method as final in Java to prevent subclasses from overriding it? Or is the OOP concept of overriding itself at fault here? 




 301 reporting :) 




 i see it. uptoke to bad movies haha 




 So last night I smoked and then went to eat at a cafeteria. I had grabbed some delicious brownies and was walking back to the table my friend was at who was at a [6] but he handles his shit like a fucking boss. Looked down on the ground and I found what I thought to be 40 bucks. I rush over and pick it up, suddenly aware people probably think I'm baked as fuck.  
Anyway when I get back to my table and show my friend I take it out of my pocket and it was actually 60 bucks! At this point I could not handle my shit at all; I had just found the largest amount of cash ever in my life on the ground. I was leaning forward on the table giggling uncontrollably, getting paranoid that someone might have seen me pick it up. But no one did, and me and my buddy left the cafeteria 60 bucks richer. I plan on using it to buy an eighth. Good times.  
TL;DR found 60 bucks on the ground, using it to buy an eighth :D  
edit: also I really enjoyed the brownie. 




 I definitely second CLRS, the sections on Red-Black trees and hashing are great. The book even denotes parts that are intended mostly for grad students so if it doesn't make sense then you don't have to panic :) 




 very good story, read the whole thing. i think you acted very maturely dude, I would have lost my shit if the police put me in cuffs... Congrats everything was cool at the end too. uptoke for chill police and even chiller people 




 *sits and waits patiently* 




 Some implementations are a bit messy.  A bit.  Messy. 




 If you can get your hands on it, try medical or blue dream. Those two get rid of my back pain very effectively. 




 This. I really enjoy smoking with friends as a social experience because it enhances it. Even if i gotta smoke people up most of the time :) 




 That was fucking beautiful ;_; Uptoke for great justice
