 I think part of the issue is that memories aren't likely to depend on just a few synapses--robust memory formation probably involves a redundant set of strengthened circuits, distributed throughout the brain. 




 This is not actually new information for the brain.  It's new information for the hippocampus, but stable dendritic spines (synapses) have been documented n the cortex for many years now.

 I know these aren't bees, but you might be interested by honeypot ants: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_ant

I've wanted to try one ever since I first heard of them, in elementary school. 




 "Done because we are too meny" 




 But doesn't gravitational pull also depend on distance?  You could get closer to the center of mass of the crumpled orange, so in that subset of cases wouldn't the gravitational pull of that orange be stronger? This is assuming OP meant the crumpled orange is collapsed inward, since the crumpled one is "more dense".

Also, I wonder how you get a hollow orange. 




 This RadioLab segment talks about what the original form of life was probably like: a big collective swamp of semi-living, self-reproducing chemicals.

Edit to add a little more detail: researchers are still trying to understand exactly how the transition from non-living to living happened, or even exactly how to define non-living and living in that transitional period.  Try this documentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJQ4r81DZtY 




 As horrible and impractical as I'm sure this will seem, a 10-20-minute power nap before you drive home would be the best and safest thing.  It might seem like you can't afford the time, but no one wants to wake up to the sound of their vehicle crashing . . . 

" Consistent with our previous study (Tietzel and Lack 2001), the 10-min nap resulted in significantly improved alertness and cognitive performance relative to a no-nap control."

 I think it could be because for a lot of the book, Shadow is lacking a sense of purpose.  It feels weird to relate to a main character who's kind of drifting along through a really bad time in his life, not even displaying a lot of angst about it.

Trying to phrase this to be non-spoilerish, but after the train incident and especially after he eats his first pasty, I started feeling more excited about where the plot was going . . . but it was still a gradual ramp-up. 




 I'm so excited to find someone else who has read it and enjoyed it!

I completely agree.  I read it for the first time in high school, and as I revisit it every few years, I find myself learning new things from it and relating to it in new ways as I gain real life experience. 




 When a sensory hair on the surface of the trap is bent, this stimulates stretch receptors--ion channels that open in response to a physical stimulus.  This allows positively charged calcium ions to flow into the receptor cells, and induces an action potential.  This is really similar to what happens in our own sensory neurons!  The ion influx changes the membrane potential of the cell locally, and this local change is propagated down the membrane throughout the cell as voltage-sensitive ion channels are stimulated by potential change.

This signal is then propagated to other cells in the lobes of the trap.  If I am reading the literature correctly, this happens in part through plasmodesmata, pores between cells that let ions flow through.  These pores can let the ion-induced voltage change continue across the borders between cells.

If two hairs are triggered within ~20 seconds of each other, the degree of the resulting signal is enough to induce a larger-scale change of ion distribution in the inner and outer surfaces of the lobes of the trap.  Either I can't find as detailed information about this part, or it is more poorly understood, but at least part of the mechanism of the trap closing relies on this ion distribution change, which causes the inner surfaces to shrink and the outer surfaces to swell, so that the lobes pop into a concave shape and snap shut.

 The queen bee is the only honey bee who gets to poop inside the hive!

All the worker bees have to hold it for most of the winter.  They only get to poop on freak warm days. 




 The Once and Future King by T. H. White: an epic, humorous, philosophical, moving re-telling of the best of the King Arthur legends.  Composed of four books that progress from an almost childrens'-book level coming of age story, to a fable-like contemplation of good and evil, to a dramatic character study of a deeply troubled hero, to a heart-breaking contemplation of morality and the struggle against the dark side of human nature. 




 Some things that we have hypotheses about, but no coherent, generally accepted explanation:

Why do we yawn?
How is a memory physically encoded in the brain?
Why is sleep so vitally important?
 




 Most insects are considered prime examples of R strategists.

I say "most" to hedge my bets; I can't think of a K strategist insect right at this moment, but biology has a lot of quirks. 




 Reading scientific papers is really hard.  It's a true developed skill.  The best thing in the long run is for you to just have a try at it, treat it as a learning experience.  Try to relax and take it slowly.

Skim through the whole paper once, just trying to take in as much meaning as you can.  Underline words that confuse you and appear often, but don't worry about them yet, just try to get the gist of the whole paper.

Now read it through again, slowly.  Look up the words you underlined, and note their meanings in the margins.  This can and probably should take hours.  That's normal.  This will get easier.

Now read it a third time.  Look at your notes.  Think about the broader meaning of the paper again.  Now you can finally start to think critically about the paper's findings, what the authors did well or poorly.

Don't give up!  Your work WILL pay off eventually.  It just takes lots of practice, frustration, and interludes for kitten videos.
