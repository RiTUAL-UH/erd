 I'm pretty used to the robotic voices because I often have to check websites for accessibility at work. I've never tried listening to a NoSleep story using Jaws or VoiceOver, though. 




 Congratulations, very well deserved. 




 Someone told me they were a fan. That totally made my day. But I have to say, pretty much any comment I receive makes me really happy. 




 Fantastic! I will definitely give it a read. 




 [The Worst Thing About Australia Is The Silence](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2sqe9k/the_worst_thing_about_australia_is_the_silence/)

There's just something about that title that gives me the creeps. 




 Theos god-awful, off-key, cat-strangling singing woke me up on the big day. I was spared the second half of his shower performance by leaving the dorm room to buy lukewarm coffee from the machine down the hall. Within the hour, we were out and headed to the airport in Theo's crapmobile. First class was balls to the walls awesome, even though Theo nearly got us thrown out for kicking the seat in front of us. It took a bit of his classic smooth talking, but we convinced the stewardess that Theo was suffering from terminal stage 5 Restless Leg Syndrome, and we got off the hook.


"Theodore Bishop and Markus Ryans?", called a smoking-hot babe, as we reached the luggage claim area.


Normally, Theo would have protested the use of his full name, but he was too busy gawking at the woman's plump red lips and tight body to notice. She congratulated us on winning the contest, and brought us to a limo waiting outside. An array of chocolate-covered strawberries and champagne waited on the back seat.


"Theo, you sure this aint a couples retreat?", I asked.


"Who cares? This shits free! Cmon. Lets have some champagne!", replied Theo, stuffing a bunch of strawberries down his gob.


The woman shut the passenger door, much to my disappointment, and headed to the drivers seat. I was hoping she'd join in on our celebration. Theo poured us  champagne, and we started drinking. Though I can typically hold my liquor, I started feeling kind of woozy after two glasses. It wasn't long before I passed out.


"Markus, shit. Wake up, man! I think we were drugged!", howled my buddy, giving me a firm open-hand slap to the face to stir me awake.


I groaned, grabbing my throbbing cheek. Theo looked as shitty as I was feeling. I had a huuuuuge hangover, the likes of which I had not felt since New Years '07. It took a moment for the reality to sink in, and for me to take in my surroundings. We were sitting in a patch of yellowing tall grass outside a run-down building covered in foliage. Its thick cement walls were grumbling apart, towering over us in an almost threatening manner. There was nothing but forest around us, and the sun was already setting. I couldn't find my phone or my luggage. I got up and spotted a massive faded sign that had fallen off the building. It read, in big bold letters: Grand Bay Hotel Miami. Under the name was something written in red spray paint, like graffiti: Grand re-opening! 




 Welcome back, bud! I miss the good times we used to share!

Write about how a haircut made you telekinetic? 




 CFU for LIFE, yo! I'd make us a logo, but I'm afraid it would look offensive. 




 First offouch.

Doesn't matter how it happened, though. I'm making you my honorary brother. We people-with-crooked-fingers have to stick together! 




 Green snakesRECYCLINGI see a pattern... 




 Thanks for the warm welcome! De-defending champion? *Gulp* N-no pressure, then?

Seriously, though. This is going to be fun. WUAHAHAHAHHAHAA. *Lightning strike* 




 Yay team!
I've got a question for you, 'Capt. This is my first round of NoSleep Teams. I read the Wiki, but I'm still a *tiny* bit confused. How do we know when it's our turn..?
(P.S. I am on your team, fearless leader!) 




 Are ya'll talking about the narrator that just kept doing fart noises the whole time? 




 I'm an early bird and always seem to get up at or around the same time every day regardless of how late I go to bed. Believe me, if I was physically capable of sleeping longer, I would. 




 I just got up because it's the weekend so I slept in. (8 am = sleeping in for this early bird)

I'm preparing my grocery list for the week. Exciting stuff. 




 I had nothing to do with his passing. It was a drunk driver. 




 Thanks for sharing. I'm both glad and sorry to hear that I'm not the only one dealing with these kind of issues. I'll try your advice, thank you.

As for your storymaybe you should write it. I found that writing this helped me come to terms with my condition. There's something cathartic about putting your thoughts on paper (or on a Word document, in this day and age). 




 Urgh, I can never reach you. Always right in the middle of my back. 




 I'm pretty average in all departments. Average height, brown hair, eyes that change color depending on the weather and/or what I wear, strong cheekbones, allegedly normal nose. (Though I sometimes use my face for reference when drawing stuff, and people keep telling me the nose looks weird.)

The only thing that's non-typical is my middle finger, which is kind of crooked at the top. I inherited that feature from my dad. 




 They booed me the whole time. 




 I would like to submit [I thanked the man who murdered my only friend](
http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2sr06h/i_thanked_the_man_who_murdered_my_only_friend/) to the contest.

Thank you! 




 What if a third bump makes them even worse? I'm not sure I could deal with that... 




 Huh, I never thought of that. I have tried a few meditation techniques (without success). Maybe I should give them a taste of their own medicine. 




 This is going to sound like a farce, but ever since I suffered a concussion last summer, I've been hearing a live studio audience around me 24/7. The doctors reassured me they were merely auditory hallucinations brought on by the bump to my noggin, and that they'd eventually go away on their own once my brain healed. It was actually kind of funny at first. I mean, once I got over the initial shock and fear of hearing the unsolicited reactions of a bunch of strangers. They started off more entertaining than disturbing, but that balance eventually shifted, and I'm afraid of them now.

 nbsp;

The very first time it happened was the day I was discharged from the hospital. It was a beautiful August day, and I was psyched to finally go out in the warm sun. Eric, my boyfriend, picked me up from the hospital to take me back to our apartment. I was in high spirits, despite a persistent headache, which had followed me since the bike accident. (Kids, wear your helmets!) Eric made a joke, and suddenly, a flurry of hysterical laugher came flooding in from every corner of the car. I screamed at Eric to turn off his surround sound system, covering my ears to drown out the noise, but the laugher only got louder. I could tell by the freaked-out look in Eric's eyes that he hadn't been playing a practical joke on me. Once the chuckles subsided, I explained what happened. Eric turned the car around and drove me straight back to the medical facility.

 nbsp;

A brain scan, a few blood tests, and countless hours later, the doctors assured me it was a harmless side-effect of the concussion, and not a case of sudden onset schizophrenia, as I had feared. It was perfectly normal. Well, as normal as hearing a room full of easily-entertained spectators could be. They told me to go home and rest.

 nbsp;

It took me a few days to adjust to the auditory hallucinations, but I eventually started to see the humor in my predicament. Meetings at work were a lot more entertaining, what with the peanut gallery projecting annoyed groans whenever my boss slipped into a boring tangent. I didn't even have to secretly roll my eyes: the voices in my head were the perfect vessel through which I could express my innermost feelings without getting in trouble. At home, my captive audience laughed at each of my jokes, even when Eric failed to react to the punch line. When I went to bed, they'd "awwww" as I wrapped my arms around Eric, and again when my cat curled up between us for warmth. The voices even became a sort of early-detection system, warning me of unseen dangers through a series of suspenseful gasps.

 nbsp;

It started going downhill about two months ago, when I was taking a shower alone in my apartment. Eric was out of town that night, and I had this lingering fear that I'd forgotten to lock the front door. As I was pouring conditioner into the palm of my hand, I heard the studio audience gasp in fear. It startled me enough that I spilled the coconut-scented beauty product near my feet. My spectators continued to breathe in in a stressed manner that suggested I was about to get attacked by a psycho-murdering home invader. I could feel myself tensing up, as I stood there naked and unprotected. Thinking I heard footsteps, I took a step back, and slipped on the small puddle of conditioner. I remember feeling my feet flying towards the air while my upper-body swung towards the floor. With a sharp pain to the side of the head, everything went black. By the time I came to, the water was running cold. I called my dad, and he brought me to the hospital. I was rewarded with 9 stitches to the temple.

 nbsp;

It's amazing what peer pressure can make you do, even when your peers don't actually exist. In a matter of weeks, my captive audience managed to completely disrupt my life. After the shower incident, it was as though they were no longer on my side. One morning, I was crossing the street when I heard them gasp. I stopped, thinking a car was heading my way. Fortunately, the street was empty. Unfortunately, my rapid stop caused me to slip on the ice and break my wrist. They laughed. Several days later, I had an important marketing presentation at work. The studio audience kept making disapproving noises, sometimes even booing me mid-presentation. It got me so tongue-tied that I messed up the whole sales pitch.

 nbsp;

The worst was what they did to my relationship with Eric. Whenever we fought, they conveyed to me through "Urrrgh!"s and "Pffftt!"s that Eric was a complete scumbag. I'm not even sure what our last fight was about. I think it started with asking him to close the laundry room door. It was such an insignificant little fight, but made worse by the advice and reactions of a bunch of imaginary strangers. They made me doubt my feelings for him, until I finally cut him loose, much to their delight.

 nbsp;

My relationships with my parents and friends devolved in a similar manner. It was shocking for me to hear what my subconscious mind actually thought about the people that had surrounded me all my life. After a few more incidents at work, my boss fired me. I was left without loved ones, friends, or a job. I felt so isolated, despite being accompanied at all times by the voices in my head. Alone in my living room, I drunk-dialed my ex, and he came over to cheer me up. We got back together that night, and it was wonderful.

 nbsp;

Everything went back to normal after Eric and I rekindled our flame. I still heard the constant and distracting laugh track, but I tried my hardest to ignore them. I was happy again, and slowly but surely, I mended every bond I'd broken. I even got my old job back. Apparently, my boss couldn't handle the workload without me. Or so I've been told. For a while, all was right with the world, until one dreadful night.

 nbsp;

I was half-asleep when I heard a knock at the door. I peeked through the window, only to find a squad car in the driveway. My heart stopped, and my faithful audience "OOoOOOOoO"ed. I opened the door, but of all the things those cops told me, all I remember hearing was this:

 nbsp;

"I'm sorry 'mam, there's been an accident."

 nbsp;

The studio audience roared with laugher and applause. Eric had died. My heart broke, but my spectators continued chuckling wildly. When Eric's casket was lowered into his grave, they laughed even harder. Tears streamed down the sides of my face, but they did not stop giggling and snickering the whole time.

 nbsp;

I must be some kind of sick monster, because I can't keep them from laughing whenever I think of him. I just can't get them to stop. 




 Man, ya gotta enunciate. When you say that last line, really put emphasis on the "ip" of "ipsum", like so:

Lorem **IP**sum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Otherwise, it's not going to work. 




 You need to draw a pentagram in blood, place a screenshot of the author's submission page in the centre, chant the forbidden words, and bright forth the author to give you his OK. 




 And now I want to write about a dude afraid of kittens. 




 I liked it!
Someone should try and stop her from driving. She could really hurt some people.

That right there. Haunting stuff. 




 I think the voice is good, but the sound quality is a little off. There's a lot of static.

OH DEAR GOD WHY IS THERE A SPIDER!?


Edit, now that I have recovered from the background image: Good pacing. Pacing is important. Your pacing is good. Spiders are not good. But the pacing is good. Yes. Good narration. 




 Oh, man. That sounds awesome...and horrific. I definitely want to read it when it's done. 




 Focus on the protagonists' reaction and thoughts about those fears. For instance, I've been working on a story where this dude has to grab something under a body bag. He has absolutely no reason to think something's going to happen to him, but he gets all nervous about it any ways. He ends up closing his eyes, and thinks he hears the bag crackling. He starts worrying that the corpse is alive, and that it's sitting up and looking at him, but he won't open his eyes to check. He later leaves the room, never knowing whether or not the corpse really moved. You can feel his terror without there being an actual, physical antagonist. 




 They're all yours! 




 The solution when you come across this kind of stuff is to tack "DUN DUN DUUUUUUN!" to the final sentence. Works every time.

Or does it? DUN DUN DUUUUUN! 




 Horror is like a box of chocolate: everything is delicious, except for the coffee-flavored truffles, because you wanted chocolate, damn it, not coffee.

There's no one good or bad recipe for horror, which is why I like the genre so much. As a writer, I get to dabble in different styles of horror without feeling like it's getting stagnant.

My advice to you is to start by writing about what scares *you* (unless you have a really weird phobia of, like, kittens or something). No matter what type of horror you write about, you'll find people who will enjoy it, so just go with what you're in the mood for. 




 Woah there, bucko. It's "Blood blood blood." Three bloods, and a period. That's a huuuuge distinction. The notebooks with "blood blood" are barely worth the paper they're written on. 




 Eh, it's a mix of virgin's blood and goat's blood, when I run out. And you ask why I have those? Why WOULDN'T I have them? 




 Do notebooks with the word "Blood blood blood." written about 500 times across its many pages count? Because I have, like, 20 of those in my the back of my car.

It would be kind of neat if we had a link in the sidebar to a page listing everyone's books (titles, urls, format). We could call it the NoSleep Library or NoSleep Bookshelf or something like that. Just a thought. 




 The selection committee ran out of tacos at the All-You-Can-Eat Taco Emporium and Crematorium. In their grief, they lost their joy de vivre and were unable to run the contest.* It's tragic, really.

*The following message may or may not be 100% accurate. 




 Thank you so much! If/when you write those posts, it will definitely help a lot of people out, myself included. 




 I'd really love to know how distribution rights work. Or, rather, what to look for and/or be weary of. I see you guys chiming about author rights when magazines call for submissions, and I have no idea what's reasonable and what isn't.

I'd also like to know your thoughts on self-publishing versus getting a publisherebooks versus physical copies, and how you'd go about it.

Another important thing I was wondering about, though this one probably doesn't have a concrete answer, is when do you know when you're ready to take that step? I absolutely love writing, and I have been extremely fortunate and lucky that some of my stories have appealed to people here, but I don't know if that means I can or should take it to the next level. Should unpublished writers just throw caution to the wind and go for it? Would it be best to try and submit for magazines and see if any of them bite so you have a -for lack of a better word- resum of published works?

Anything you share would be most helpful.

Thank you! 




  I actually plan on putting a few posts up here about my own experiences with self publishing because I just like helping out my homies.

That would be absolutely fantastic. Please do. I've been curious about the whole process.
 




 I've been *Itch*ing to try this out. Count me in! 




 I wish I could, but I am physically incapable of smiling with these twitches forcing my lips downwards at all times.


.em truh ot gniog s'eh, em pleh esaelP 




 In your BOOK? I see what you did there, you sneaky punster, you! 




 GASP!
I'll just have to douse myself in salt.


Edit: Wait, no. I'm not the one doing the ritual. What do I care about protecting myself against slug demons? 




 What if it's a slug demon? 




 Man, your parents will be ticked off when they wake up to go to the washroom and step on a bunch of salt. 




 If you were a carnival ride, which ride would you be and what would be your maximum capacity? 




 This is NoSleep. For all we know, the bobble heads will be decapitated.

 Okay, who let Tortilla back into the wine cellar? 




 How the thinks anyone will believe he wrote that while he apparently cannot write a complete sentence is beyond me. 




 Dozens of missing posters cling to lampposts on the empty streets outside my home. Most hold photos of beloved family pets, but a few show the faces of children. They rustle in the wind, providing the only sound I can hear for miles, safe for the relentless tapping of the creatures feet against the sides of my house. I have not seen a soul in days. The monster has doubtlessly gotten them all by now. Perhaps there are still a few people left alive, naively praying for help to arrive. Those who wisely chose to hide in their basements could yet have survived, but nothing will stop it from reaching them, too. What happened here was my fault: I awoke the prehistoric menace. All I can do now is sit and wait for the end.

 nbsp;
 
Ever since I was a boy, I have been fascinated with fossils. It began the day my parents took me to the lake for a fireworks display. While we were waiting for the show to begin, my mother told me that a man had recently stumbled across a large fossil on the shore. I am not sure whether she was trying to give a bored child something to do, or merely sharing a tidbit of information. Either way, I did what any kid would do in such a situation: I started hunting for a fossil of my own, dreaming of the fame and fortune it would bring me. I walked up and down the shoreline, eyes peeled for anything of interest, until I noticed a thin slab of black stone among the rocks. Something about it just screamed "fossil", and I excitedly turned it over. On its underside was a perfectly-preserved silvery ammonite, shimmering in the setting sunlight. The fossil was about an inch wide, and was accompanied by a few smaller specimens. I was positively beaming with pride when I showed it to my parents, boasting that I had made an incredible discovery, and that my long and fruitful career as an archaeologist had begun.

 nbsp;

Over 20 years later, that fossil was still on display in my living room, even though my career as a palaeontologist did not pan out. (One of my teachers informed me that archaeologists do not, in fact, dig up dinosaurs.) Still, that fortuitous discovery in my childhood stuck with me through my entire life, and I never quite lost the compulsion to look for fossils wherever I went. As the years passed, I found other specimens: smaller ones, broken ones, but never one as striking as my very first. Not until last summer, that is.

 nbsp;

It was a pleasant day: sunny and warm, but without the overwhelming humidity that usually weighed me down. Kids were playing in the streets, blue jays were battling squirrels for sunflower seeds in my feeder, and the sky was as clear as I had ever seen it. I decided to take advantage of the beautiful day by going for a stroll through the woods in my backyard. Following a beaten path, I navigated through the trees and to a quarry of stones beyond the woodland, where I sometimes searched for fossils. Up until then, I had not found any specimens there, but my luck was about to change. Extending from a mound of rocks, I spotted a polished burgundy stone. As I made my way towards it, I noticed a shape on its side. It was the most beautiful fossil my eyes had ever seen. About half a foot in diameter, the ammonite looked impeccable in every way. Its golden hue made it seem almost magical. I examined the snail-like relief, re-experiencing the genuine enthusiasm I had felt as a child.

 nbsp;

I ran back to my place, my heart pounding with joy, and retrieved a wheelbarrow and towels to carry and protect the stone. After loading the boulder onto my makeshift carrier, I began pushing the heavy stone back home, sweat pouring down the sides of my face. I cleared some of the bushes in the garden outside my front door, and placed the stone carefully among my plants. For weeks, I showed it off to everyone that stopped by: neighbors, family members, even the pizza delivery boy. I felt giddy just looking at my amazing lawn decoration.

 nbsp;

As obsessed with and proud of the fossil as I was, I am ashamed to admit it took me far too long to notice the change. At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light. It would seem a little bit bigger when I came home from work, but not so much so that it struck me as unusual. It was not until I returned from a two-week vacation that I truly realized the fossil was morphing. Though I counted five rings on its spiral when I left, I returned to find seven, and a sense of dread began to form in the back of my mind. Over the course of the following weeks, the creature became larger and larger. As more rings appeared and it grew from one foot to three, it became clear that the stone holding it could no longer contain the mass.

 nbsp;

One morning, I stepped outside to find the red boulder shattered in half, and the spiral-shaped creature absent from its surface. All that was left was the scent of seaweed and salt emanating from the broken stone. My immediate reaction was that of relief. That is, until I saw the creature in the very foundation of my house. Still golden, still static, but several feet larger, the fossil had found a new home. It was around that time that missing posters started popping up, and that my birdfeeder ceased emptying. I should have seen the signs, but I was in denial. Besides, how could a fossilized creature come to life? I dug my head in the sand, convincing myself that it was just the work of a very talented guerrilla artist. I was a fool for not taking action: I should have destroyed it when I had the chance.

 nbsp;

The metamorphosis accelerated after the creatures relocation. The snail-like shape grew larger, and began to uncoil, revealing thousands of tiny spiky legs protruding from its shell. The stench of an ocean breeze infected every corner of my house as the monstrous form grew to a meter in length. I was terrified beyond words, but powerless to stop the coming storm. No one believed me when I told them what was happening. Some laughed, others called me crazy. Every day, new missing posters got tacked to the areas mailboxes and lampposts, offering rewards that would never be claimed. Nothing could stop the monster from growing, until, one day, it ceased hiding within stone, leaving nothing but a crack in the concrete in its wake. I hoped it had moved on, but it was not long before I heard that Mrs. Carsons son had gone missing. He was the first of many children to mysteriously 'disappear'. I stopped leaving the house after that day.

 nbsp;

A few nights ago, I finally ran out of food. Too afraid to abandon the safety of my home, I called for pizza. I thought it would be all right. I would never have done it if I had known what was about to happen. I watched as the delivery boy exited his car and walked up to my door. A dark shape scurried in the bushes outside. I knew it was the monster, so I frantically banged on the window, trying to warn the man. As he reached for the doorbell, the horrid beast launched itself towards him. Not wanting to see, I shut my eyes, but could still hear the ghastly CRUNCH as it engulfed him, leaving nothing behind. Sobbing profusely, I glanced out the window, and could clearly make out the armor-plated form of the horrid millipede-like creature in the cars headlights. It had grown to over ten meters in length. I shut the curtains in fear when it snapped its head towards me, as though insulted that I dared to look at it. The piercing sound of shredding metal echoed down the street as the creature ate the delivery boys car.

 nbsp;

I can hear it skittering along the outside of my house now. It will not hurt me. Not yet, at least. It is saving me for later. This is its nest, and I am to be the food for the hundreds of young ones it spawned in the inner walls of my home. I have spent my whole life looking for fossils. Now that they surround me, I cannot help wishing I had taken up knitting instead. 




 Congratulations, ya'll! 




 Congratulations to the both of you! I look forward to catching up to date on the NoSleep podcast (I'm nearing the end of season 3) and hearing your stories. : ) 




 But I so enjoy touching things. ;D 




 Happy anniversary, Mr. Butler! I love you beyond the scope of words, and my love for you is as eternal as the darkness of the night. 




 Unless /u/voodoovegetable is *actually* a serial killer and is only asking to cover his tracks... 




 New idea: a compilation book of all our stories, presented in a step-by-step interpretive dance guide format. It'll make the NY Times best sellers list in no time flat. 




 In her permission form, it just said that the intention was *not* to make money, but that should that change in the future, it would be divided equally between the writers, but that if a writer had more than one story, they would still get the same percentage. 




 When I gave my consent, I had no idea this was being done against the wishes of the moderators. I am definitely withdrawing it now. 




 Or species. 




 That wasn't chicken. 




 Ooooo, that would be awesome. And then you add in a feature where they  also warm up the house (in the winter) so that you can leave your bed and *not* freeze while getting dressed. Would it drive up the heating bill? Yes. Would it be worth it? ABSOLUTELY. 




 My sister got me an alarm clock for Christmas that imitates the sunrise. Over the course of half an hour, it lights up brighter and brighter until the alarm goes off. It's very pleasant, I would definitely recommend it.

The most important thing; however, is to keep electronics OUT of the bedroom. Lights and electronics can keep you from sleeping well and that, in turn, will keep you from waking up well. 




 It's okay. I read my income tax reports in David's voice.

Just a thought, Mr. Cummings: you could open a second Podcast called 'David Cummings reads your taxes." You'll make millions. 




 ...xD 




 That is so wonderfully poetic. 




 Huh, consider me impressed and newly-informed. I figured sites could pull your MAC address just like they do the rest of the information they keep track of. 




 Any comment that is positive is a comment that I like! Unless the comment is positive in the sense of a pregnancy test. I don't want my stories getting pregnant. They're too young to have babies. 




 I was wondering where you were going with that. And then I got to the end. And now, I applaud you. 




 David Cummings and Peter Lewis are definitely my two favorite male narrators. Jessica Prokuski is my favore female narrator. I'd say my LEAST favorite narrator is Demon Overlord 5000. His voice is just too...I don't know...raspy?

 




 Geez, why are people giving you a hard time? o0; It's a legitimate topic of discussion.

I didn't watch a lot of horror movies growing up in order to protect my eardrums from my mom's high-pitch screams. Now that I'm older, I find that the problem with horror movies is that they rely too heavily on jump scares rather than actually trying to frighten you...so most movies do end up being Asylum-level bad. I remember watching The Cube and 13 Ghosts when I was in highschool. Both times, my friends were terrified and squeezing the blood out of my hands. Guess everyone's different.
*Edit: Taming the typo demons. 




 I've played games where they could ban a specific computer's MAC address. The unruly player usually just jumped on their laptop and kept being a jerk. 




 My dad startled posting stories to NoSleep a couple months ago. One time, when he was visiting me, he posted before I had the chance to post mine, and I was locked out of posting for another 10 minutes.

I know it's too keep people from spamming, but c'mon. We weren't even using the same computer. This could have been prevented if Reddit had put the stopper on the MAC addresses instead.

So my guess would be around 10 minutes. 




 I was in the middle of talking to Sarah when you said that. Weird. 




 I just updated it.
