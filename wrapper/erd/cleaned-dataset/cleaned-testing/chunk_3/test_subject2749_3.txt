 This is the first video I have uploaded in a few weeks. It is a Let's Play of Hero Generations. Hope you enjoy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhQHa6MZruY 




 This is the revival of the Vice City let's play on my channel. Hope you enjoy it and if you wanna see more feel free to leave some support with a like, comment or subscribe. Or if you feel so inclined, feedback. I am still trying to change the layout of my outro's to have video play on them instead of a still image. Thanks. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE1fVFfmHu8
