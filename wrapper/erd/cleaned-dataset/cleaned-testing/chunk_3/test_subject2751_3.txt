 Played for the first time:

**Panamax**: Really liked it, definitely in my top 5 for 2014. The rules explanation takes quite a while, but once we started playing everything is quite straight forward. It comes down to either (1) take a contract and load cargo; or (2) Move the ships. Players need to balance the pace well - shipping everything in a round might boost income and save costs, but it might be very difficult to avoid costs in the next round.

**City hall**: A worker placement + bidding game. Played this with 3 players. Was not impressed as I won by exploiting the health commissioned spot early on which seemed too powerful to me.

Games that I've played before: **Small World**, **Viticulture**, **Coloretto** 




 To expand on the games that you already enjoy: **One Night Ultimate Werewolf**, **Dead of Winter** 




 Games I've played for the first time:

**Hyperborea** - Really liked this! More of a engine/efficiency building game than a civ/4x. Bag building and action selection is very unique. Only complaint is on the similar colours of the cubes.

**Vitivulture** - Pretty standard light worker placement game about making wine. I would even consider this to be a gateway game. Heard that the expansion brings complexity so I'll give it a go if I have a chance.

**Vinhos** - Another game about making wine which is one of the heaviest economic games I played. I liked it a lot but felt that it was a bit unnecessarily complex - it's like 6 mini-games in one. 

**Theseus** - Sci-fi mancala with different race abilities. Very tactical and plays within an hour. I'm surpriksed that I haven't hear many people mentioning this game before. 

Games that I've played before:  **Hanabi**, **Quartermaster General**, **Fresco**, **Carcassonne**, 




 They are currently organising an Agricola tournament (with drafting rules of course) that starts in Jan 2015. Search for London on Board on meetup.com if you wish to sign up. 




 **Pictomania**, kind of like Pictionary but you have to draw and guess what others are drawing at the same time. Immensely fun to watch! 




 The sale for the previous days were amazing....
Betrayal at House on the Hill: 20
Small World : 20
Lords of Waterdeep: 15

But of course they were all gone in the matter of minutes if not seconds


EDIT: Dominion: 15, gone within seconds as well. 




 Great collection of Euros!

I dream of owning **Glory to Rome** and **Age of Empires III** too, both very solid games but they don't seem get enough attention here. 




 I have played the games you have listed except for Archipelago and The Pillars of the Earth.

It depends on i) whether you are looking for something new and ii) whether the "more players" you play with are comfortable with heavier games. I would recommend Castles of Mad King Ludwig as it is incorporates bidding (sort of), tile laying, and building your own castle, which is sort of a blend of the games you enjoy.

Note that:

Concordia - without the expansion, this is a 3+ player game.

Manhattan Project, Bruges, Euphoria - These are all solid games for 4 players but I'm not sure how well they go with 2 players. 




 I've played 4 games with the expansion and feel that the new races make the game much more interactive and competitive/aggressive. 

Volcano factions can splurge easily in the first round if they wish and Shapeshifters and Riverwalkers could "intrude" into your home terrain. In a 4-5 player game, if you are not careful around these factions you could get locked in quite easily. 




 4 players. As with other Feld games I think it would play well in 2p and 3p scenarios as well. After rules explanation, we finished in under 2 hours and didn't have to revert to the rulebook so the rules were quite straightforward.
Minor complaint would be that there is an icon on the board that was printed really small (it doesn't help that the board is extremely colourful). Also requires a bit of time for initial setup. 




 My friend bought it at Essen for 35. Boardgameguru now has it at 40. 




 Great week for me:

**Terra Mystica (with Fire and Ice expansion) x2** - played the Shapeshifters (1st in a 4p game) and the Riverwalkers (2nd in a 5p game). Loved it. I feel that the expansion makes the game more interactive and you really have to keep an eye on what other players are capable of doing.

**Aquasphere** - Loved it too! I'm pleasantly surprised that a simple programming/action mechanic created such an interesting game. The length felt just right, and the production quality is superb. Thinking of buying a copy.

**La Isla** - Underwhelmed by this new Feld game. Minimal interaction, theme is bland. Upside is the short setup and play time.

**Bora Bora** - Lots of interesting choices throughout the game. However I find that the dice rolls can screw one over even more so than CoB.

**Steam Donkey** - Pretty decent filler for its price and length. Easy to teach as well.

 




 I would guess costs such as rent and payroll take a big part in this.
In order to compete effectively with online stores, it is true that FLGS should be offering an experience (e.g. game nights/ staff recommendations) rather than just sales so that people are willing to pay a little bit extra to support it. 




 Short but fruitful week of gaming.

Games I've played for the first time:

**Le Havre**: Absolutely loved it. I was scared to take a loan (fear of not feeding developed from other games) and ended up with 167 points but next time I'll definitely go for loans. I think I prefer it over Agricola because everything is open information (except for special buildings but there's a way to take a peek). Only downside is that it's 3 hours.

**Dungeon Lords**: I had high expectations for the game but I just found it too unforgiving and chaotic. Hope to try Dungeon Petz some time.

**Pictomania**: I was truly pleasantly surprised. I'm not much of a party game player but this was so fun to come up with a clever way to draw/complain at the obscure drawings from other players etc. I hadn't laughed so much during a game for quite a while.

**King of Siam**: Neat little area influence game. Pretty good for its weight and length (each player only gets 8 actions during the game).

Games I've played before: **Lewis   Clark**, **Russian Railroads**, **Greed**, **For Sale**, **Splendor**  




 I'm one of the lucky ones I would say. I live in London and had joined the board game meet up group that meets practically every single day.

If I show up on both days in the weekend I am guaranteed to enjoy 18 hours of gaming per week already. 




 Pretty good week.

Games I played for the first time:

**Sons of Anarchy**: It's pretty good for a light thematic game. There's a bit of dice rolling though so we didn't take the game too seriously

**Santiago de Cuba**: Good fun for its weight and length. Maybe too much of screwing people over though.

**Navegador**: The roundel idea is neat but I have doubt over its replayability. I would still prefer Concordia.

**Dead of Winter**: I'm usually not a big fan of co-op/semi co-op but this was probably the best one I've played. We were certain we would fail but we did pull it through (finished main objective) by strategically attracting zombies to different places. Completely forgotten about my second objective at the end though so I didn't win...

**Taj Mahal**: mildly interesting but it feels unsatisfying as a bidding game. 

**Around the world in 80 days**: Slightly fun racing game with a card drafting element. Not much depth to it, probably playing once is enough.

Games I've played before: **Istanbul**, **Sail to India**, **Greed**
