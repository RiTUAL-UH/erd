 You need encouragement? Did you put a little too much money into dogecoin than you could afford? 

Dogecoin has been around since December (as have I) and so much has been accomplished! The water wells, Jamaican bobsled team, save them hood, Nascar. The community is always positive and has grown to almost the size of btc. For dogecoin to go away it would mean that no one mines anymore and there are no more merchants to accept it and no longer has volume on exchanges. I don't see that happening anytime

 Im thinking 3 wallets. Mobile, pc, and my pc. Just to be safe 




 Stop using the drive if possible. Load it into another pc and run recovery software like "Recuva" looking for any *.key files (I believe that's the wallet from multidoge)
