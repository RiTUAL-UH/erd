 I was raised to be a trekkie. My first crush was on Spock. My father thought me the "live long and prosper" hand gesture when I was at most 5 (that's as far back as I can remember knowing it). I watched all the shows on TV for years, but only recently finished watching them entirely, thanks to Netflix. 

Picard and Janeway are very close to my heart, along with all the other captains, but Janeway will always be my number one role model. She manages to be super badass while retaining her femininity. And her hometown is the same as mine (Btown forever!). 




 Used unpopular opinion puffin for a reason. 









 This afghan has gotten big enough that I think it will stay home. And the constant work has made my wrists hurt, and I can still get a good 8 hours of work done outside of the 4 hours I have class. 




 Hello all!

I am working on my first afghan ever, which I hope to give to my grandmother for her 92nd birthday on 3/15. I started it on Saturday, and am already making a lot of progress. However, I still think that I'll need to spend every free moment to work on it to get it done in time. 

I brought it to class with me today, because I've got about an hour in between some classes, but it is already so big that it takes up so much space in my backpack.

How do y'all deal with traveling with a huge project? Is there a magical folding technique I could use? If not, do y'all have any tips for bringing a project with you to places?

Tl;dr: how can I bring the afghan I'm working on with me without taking up a lot of space in my backpack? 




 Also, should I make sure to get a non-declawed cat to match my current non-mutilated one? I dont want any injuries. 




 Hello, another question. I trust Reddit on cat information.

I'm planning on adopting a new cat this Friday, because my 10.5-month old needs a friend. I'm planning on getting someone a little older than her. Do I need to make sure to get separate food for him? My current kitty is pretty much done growing at this point, and has started eating less (I fill her bowl up twice a day and she hasn't finished it in 30 minutes anymore), so I was wondering if I could start the switch to adult food yet. Or, could I feed a 12-15 month old kitten food for a couple months? I can afford getting separate food, but it would be nice if I could use the same.

Tl;dr: getting a new cat, hopefully not a kitten. Could I use the same food with my 10.5-month-old as a more adult cat? Either switch the current one to adult food or give the newbie kitten food. 




 This. I usually just spray it on my hairbrush and pass it through a few times, especially on the underside. 




 Collinsites forever! 

But seriously, if all LLCs have the same level of community as Collins, then I highly suggest it. 




 The store close to me has them for less than $6, so I do when I'm broke or don't feel like walking to the liquor store. 









 And I always put on Frank Sinatra.  




 I had a friend with epilepsy (or some other seizure thing) and remember the first time he had one in front of me. I'll tell you, it isn't pretty, although you can probably imagine that. We were out for a smoke and all of a sudden he looked out to nowhere and next thing I knew, he was on the ground seizing. My lifeguard skills kicked in, so I got him to the safety position and got someone to call for an ambulance, cuz it was his second that day. It was so scary, he didn't know what year it was, who the president was, anything. You're description helped me realize just how out of it you get. 




 I've heard that the bitter apple stuff or whatever doesn't always work. That's why I went for the polish first. 




 So, I posted a question a couple weeks ago regarding computer cords and that foul tasting nail polish designed to help you quit biting your nails. 

I've been putting a coat on a couple times a week and my cat hasn't chewed on my charger at all. I saw her try when I first did it, and she was licking her lips and I could tell that she had an unpleasant taste in her mouth.

Hope this is useful to anyone else. It's been a great solution for me.

Tl;dr: if your cat chews on your charger cords, coat the cords with Bite-It and it will help. 




 This may be better suited for the general discussions thread, but this stupid cold has got me thinking.

Does anyone else have old long sleeve shirts that are way too small to wear on their own, but make the best cold weather undershirts? I've got a black one from my goth phase (7-8th grade) that I've had on under my sweaters all week. Like, I know the shirt itself looks silly, but layers are awesome. 




 We had to put my family dog down 5+years ago, and this brought a tear to my eye. If I weren't broke, I'd give you gold. 




 That's literally the only way I can get the motivation to clean. I go full-on 40's/50's housewife. 




 Thanks! My sister says the clips were a free add-on when she ordered the brushes, and I don't eat chips, so I figured I'd put them to good work. 









 Less thought out than the earlier comment, but I'll give my two cents.

When I want to make a pattern, I just make a second of the same project. I write down what I remember doing for the first time, with plenty of room for notes. As I work up the new version, I change the blueprint as needed.

That said, I've only written three or four patterns before, and it was mainly to keep track of things when I was making big projects. 




 All drugstore products, and I'm sorry I'm smiling so creepily in the photo.

Sitting around my apartment being cold. I got out from underneath my blankets for the first time to take this.
Wool leggings from REI, neon t-shirt from Michael's, homemade black cowl. 




 I don't have the money right now for a new one, I'm probably going to put a little away until Spring Break. 

Should I put my current cat's litter box near the door? The only viable option in my apartment for that would be to have the litter box in my bedroom, in front of the bathroom door, and I would almost certainly step in it.

If I put two hanging toys on either side of the doorknob, would that help socialize them when I'm in class?

I plan on going to the shelter fairly often to play with the available cats, and see which ones have similar personalities. I just think someone with almost as much energy would chill her out so much, because she's always running around and trying to play with everything. 




 Haha, when I brought my Katie home for Thanksgiving, we heard her meowing for almost an hour and didn't see her, which is unusual. Turns out she was in the cupboard with the trash can, and she didn't seem phased at all. 




 I've searched, so I know the basics of bringing a new cat home, but my situation leaves me with some questions.

Katie is a 10-month-old barn cat. She's been with me and strictly indoor since she was 12 weeks old, but she is sassy and spastic as hell. We've had playdates with other people's cats, and she has always terrorized them, even though she's tiny. My best friend's 13 pound Mane Coon hides whenever they've been together. 

Is she too much of a terrorist to adapt to another cat?

Also, my apartment only has one inside door, in the bathroom, and my bathroom is tiny. To keep them separate for a bit, would keeping the newbie in the bathroom be ok?

Katie lived with two rabbits for a couple months, and got along great with them, but I'm definitely not getting a rabbit (I lost so many cords in my 2.5 months of living with rabbits).

She is seriously tiny. She's maybe 7 pounds, was the runt of her litter, and hasn't gotten any bigger for a few months.

EDIT: I'd go to shelter and see what's available, but I think getting a fixed male between 8 months and 1.5 years old would be best. I think she'd get along better with a rambunctious friend who's bigger than her.

Tl;dr: I think my cat could use a friend, but she's always terrorizing any other cat she's met. My apartment is small. Could I get another cat and keep him in my bathroom? 




 Background: I am a political science major, and have wanted to work in the public sector for as long as I can remember. I believe that the point of government is to promote the common good, and the fact that the founding fathers chose these words to be the first to appear in our constitution represents that belief to me. 









 If it makes you feel any better, even the skinny members of my family get diabetes. 




 That's a great idea! I have a spare toothbrush, anyway. 




 Great! Maybe I can save my oil, then. 




 Ive had incredible luck when it comes to acne/clogged pores. I wash my face every time I shower and have never had a serious breakout.

I'll prolly just use my vegetable oil, because most of the benefits of coconut oil I already have: my hair grows too fast; I use henna to dye my hair, which conditions; I don't scar too bad. 




 I've searched both here and /r/MakeupAddiction, and couldn't find an answer to this specifically.

I've seen a lot of posts saying sugar+olive oil is a good lip exfoliant, but I usually don't keep olive oil in my house (my family has a history of low cholesterol, so I use butter for everything). Would sugar+vegetable oil do the same thing? I've got vegetable oil for in case I decide to make a cake from a mix.

Tl;dr: does sugar+vegetable oil exfoliate lips as much as sugar+olive oil? 




 I'm planning on getting a nude lip liner when I go grocery shopping next, because mine ran out. For every day, I'd be more careful and use a brush, I was just excited to swatch these. 









 One of my best friends has worked at a pet store for 1.5 years, so I definitely asked her. Like I said before, I'm going to try the Bite-It, and if that doesn't work, I'll go with something citrus.  




 Katie may be teething right now, I've read it happens several times in the first year and she's been chewing on everything much more in the last month or so (even the corner of the bag of kitten food), so hopefully it will pass. But I've got several options now. 




 Yeah, my problem is that she pretty much only chews when I'm not watching, which makes me think that she knows not to do it. 

I'm trying the Bite-It for now, but I've got lemon spray too, if I find her chewing. She tried earlier and was then licking her lips to get the taste off, and I'm guessing the tiny bit she might get from that won't be too bad for her. 




 Thanks!

I'm worried, because I've heard several stories about bitter apple not working, and my baby chews on or licks pretty much everything.

Would lemon wood polish spray work?

I'm going to ask the guys at the tech store when I get my new charger. 




 I asked a similar question on a thread in /r/cats, but you ladies (and gents) might know, too.

My 10-month old kitten chews on my MacBook charger and ruins it. I'm going to buy my third in a month, and at $80 a pop, it's getting expensive. She only does it when I'm not looking, which makes me think she already knows not to do it.

Can you coat a charger with that foul tasting nail polish designed to help you quit biting your nails? I think that would deter her, but I'm not sure if it's safe for the charger or the cat. I know not to use anything spicy, but no-bite is just chemicals that taste horrid (I've used it, and the spicy kind, which just made me want to suck on my fingers more because I love spicy food). If not, I can get some bitter apple stuff, as /r/cats suggested, but it's a long hike followed by a long bus ride to get to a pet store here. Maybe Kroger would have some in the pet department.

Tl;dr: cat chews on power cord. Can I coat my new charger in no-bite to keep her from ruining another? 




 I know this is an old post, but do you think coating the cord in that foul tasting nail polish designed to help you quit biting your nails? Would that damage the cord? I'm about to buy my third MacBook charger in a month, just because I take away any short strings so my baby won't choke.

EDIT: I think she knows not to do it, because I never see her chewing, but when I come back inside after a smoke, the cord is ruined. 




 I've been crocheting for about 10 years now. My mother taught me the basics, and I just figured the rest out for myself. About 4 years ago I finally realized that what I had been calling single crochet was actually a slip stitch, and my double crochet was actually single. 

I've tried following patterns for things in the past, and the things always end up too big or just strange. I can kind of read them (at least, I understand the whole "ch4, slst into first, ch1 and dc into next st, repeat 4 times" thing, but nothing ever works right.

That being said, I have successfully made hats, socks, scarves, and even a dress with my limited knowledge. If I want a fancy stitch, I can look up the stitch itself and then incorporate it into whatever I'm making. Patterns can be nice for a basis (I needed on to figure out heels the first time I made socks), but I find it much easier to just do my own thing. Increase, decrease as you need to, but once you know sc, dc, inc, and dec, you can make anything. Anything that requires a close fit, just make sure to fit check every couple of rows (when I made socks for the first time, I slipped them on even more often) and don't be afraid to undo a lot of work if something didn't go well (I also had to redo the toes on my first pair of socks ~6 times).

Idk the point of this post, really, but I searched for something similar, and nothing really came up.

TL;DR: you don't have to be able to read patterns to make things, you just need to be willing to do fit checks super often, and to pull things out if you realize what you're doing is wrong. 




 I've made several. First, measure from your waist to however long you want your skirt to be. Then, measure around your waist and every couple of inches going down the length. Divide each of these numbers in four. Cut two kinda funky rectangles that are as long as you want and as wide as you need at each point you measured. I usually put dots at each measurement point, then connect them. Using the same measurements, cut the front on the fold so it will fall flat. Sew all the rectangles together, put a zipper in the back, hem, and voila!

This is how I always make them, although having a waistband could be nice, too. There are better tutorials with picture online. 




 Munster is around 4.5 hours from me, but I've got some friends from the region, so I'll ask them if they'd be down for a trip. Quite a few Three Floyd's brews are available near me, so at least I've got that going for me. 




 I'll be on the lookout for all of these. Since I can get Harpoon cider, I'll bet I can find others. Thank you!

Edit: my Kroger had Harpoon ipa, and it's pretty good. And def good for a beginner's ipa 




 I'm in southern Indiana.

Edit: but my health food store has a huge selection, but a large portion of it is international.  




 Hello all! 

I decided for my new year's resolution that I would become more of a beer connoisseur. Both my local grocery store and my local health food store have really excellent build-your-own six pack selections, so I've been picking up one or two of those a week.

To be honest, I prefer a good cider to just about anything (Harpoon Craft Cider is my favorite thing ever), but I also like a good beer. However, most of the selection at Kroger is ipa's and apa's. I'm really not a fan of pale ales, or really anything that is super hoppy, but I'd like to build a taste for it.

Wheat beers are probably my favorite, and Upland Wheat Ale is one of my favorite beers, although that might just be because it's widely available where I live. Of the mix-a-sixes I've made, my favorites were Baltika #4   9, Two Brothers Ebel's Weiss, and Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat beer.

What are your recommendations to start my journey away from dark lagers and wheat ales?

To;Dr: I would like to expand my beer horizons, especially when it comes to pale ales and strong hoppy flavors. What do you recommend?

EDIT: the mix-a-six at my Kroger today had both Founder's all day ipa (which wasn't the best) and Harpoon ipa (which is pretty good). Thanks for the suggestions, y'all! I hope the health food store is open the next time I want a mix-a-six, because I know their selection is better.

EDIT 2: I also got some gumballhead, which is a good beer for those in my situation, who love wheat beer and want to learn to like hoppy beers. It's a good middle ground. 




 Yeah, my hometown's population is less than 4k. And a lot of my friends are from even smaller towns. 




 I've come to the realization that I am a boring individual. I have no hobbies, I don't branch out, and I'm sad most of the time.

I go to class, then I sit and watch Netflix and get drunk until I go to bed. Due to injuries, there are very few physical activities I can do without immense pain, and the only other things I do for fun (crochet, baking) are entirely solo.

I've been dating around, looking for someone I have anything in common with, and simply haven't been able to. I thought it was because I hadn't found anyone I'm really interested in, but that's not it. It's because I have nothing to have in common with someone.

TL; DR: I'm boring, and I don't know how to change it.

EDIT: Thank you all for your comments. Unfortunately, I just started Christmas break, but you all have helped me think that maybe I should just go do things. 




 Hello all!

I've been invited to a holiday party for the office where I worked for a year. I quit in August, because I was too busy to continue working there, but I still think I should make an appearance, because I loved the job and it gave me so many connections.

As background, the office was on my college campus, and focuses on educating the public about Congress. My boss was a former Congressman. The party is for every faculty and staff member in the department, which include my former Congressman boss and a former Senator from my state.

While I've been told by several people that faculty parties are generally not super fancy, I believe that this one is a bit different. In the year I worked there, I never saw a man out of a suit and woman in anything other than business. My office was business casual, but I was usually the least well-dressed person there, even in pencil skirts and cardigans. 

I recently slipped on the ice and dislocated my knee, and am finally off crutches, but I don't think that I can handle anything other than sneakers or snow boots. However, I think I'd be able to switch into nicer shoes for the small amount of time I'll be there, and I've also got a pair of nice black, flat oxfords that would be acceptable. It is from 3:30-5:30, but I'll have to leave by 4:30 to get to a final.

I have a few ideas as to what to wear. I've got a deep purple velvet dress, which I usually put with mustard tights and brown heels, as well as a huge number of different colored pencil skirts, which I'd pair with a nice white button-down. Any advice you could give me would be very much appreciated. I'm broke, so I can't buy anything new, but I have a few things fancier than what I usually wore to the office.

TL;DR: Holiday party tomorrow from 3:30-5:30pm, for faculty and staff of a school in which I worked in an office for a year. I would assume business casual to semi-formal, except to attendees will be a former Congressman and a former Senator. HALP! 




 I made my dresses both years, so they are just sitting in closets at home. Since they were made to fit me perfectly, I didn't even think about donating them. Junior year, I didn't even get it finished, and had to sew it closed onto my body. 




 Lost mine, but omg it was the cutest lighter ever. 









 This post: http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1ru7q4/can_we_stop/

I hardly go on /r/trees anymore, because it's so filled with boys (not men) and posts that just don't interest me much, but this post came up on my front page yesterday, and it got me thinking. I've pretty much only had dates recently from dating sites, because I'm too awkward to actually ask people out in person (unless I'm high, and I don't like being high in public). My profile talks about Mary Jane, because it's a big deal in my life, and I usually only respond to people who also talk about it, or at least have answered questions by saying that they smoke. 

Do you ladies look for men who smoke? I often do, like I said, but that is far from enough to make me want to be with them as anything but smoking buddies. Also, have you ever experienced being "put on a pedestal?" I have some female friends who talk a lot about how they get to smoke for free most of the time, and that they have joined a group of men smoking a bowl, just because they wanted company (this was mainly true when all my friends and I lived in a dorm and we had a smoking area for cigarettes that most of us used to smoke weed), and have been passed the bowl without asking and after having said that they were just out of a cigarette or company and weren't trying to be smoked out.

TL;DR: Do you specifically look for men who smoke when trying to find someone to date? Have you ever experienced being "put on a pedestal" for being an girl who smokes? 




 Thanks! It wasn't due after break, I just worked a lot on it. It's for an incomplete I got last fall, and I have until the end of the semester to submit it. I'll say that it'll be pretty dense, but if you're willing to proof a comparative analysis of worldwide campaign finance, I would appreciate it!

EDIT: The piece is named Godric, for obvious (to me) reasons. I usually smoke rolled things, but I ran out of papes and this bowl holds about the same amount as the spliffs I roll. 




 While it doesn't look as good as it could, it tastes amazing and buttery and eggy, as brioche should. If anyone's wondering, the recipe is from "The Roux Brothers on Patisserie." A lot of the other recipes aren't great, and with this one I still add a bit of nutmeg and a tiny bit more sugar, but I love the book simply for the amazing food porn. 




 Thanks. I wish I had a baking sheet big enough to not have to shape the braid into a circle, but it still tastes amazing. 




 It's the tiniest bit overdone, but not burned at all. My recipe calls for double eggwash, and this was my first time making a double batch. Not the prettiest, but still tastes amazing, as brioche should. 









 I've been dying my hair with henna for seven years now. It is permanent, and conditions your hair/makes it shiny. I do it myself and buy the powder in bulk at the health food store, so idk about doing it at a salon. Just make sure you use pure henna and do a strand test. Some heavy metals in some brands react really badly with dyed hair. Like, melt your hair off bad. 









 My cold sad outfit is wool leggings, wool socks, and a baseball-style top I cut to be off the shoulder from the golf team from my sophomore year of high school.

Warm sad/hungover days are Paris boxers and some random tank top.

When I want to go out and feel really sexy, I have this royal blue pencil skirt that my friends and I call "the skirt," because I have literally never worn it and not been hit on hard. 




 Not exactly what you're asking, but I usually layer a few pairs of tights for warmth and opacity. 




 Everyone in my family asks for my chocolate chip cookie recipe. Making grandma-level cookies at 21 is one of the things I love bragging about.

EDIT: Omg, I love not having class after noon of Mondays and Wednesdays. 




 Thank you! 




 Thank you! While I don't have any experience with retail, I have been called the Queen of Organization, and I at least think I know my stuff. 




 Thanks! Like I said, I dropped my resume off in July, right after they had done a bunch of hiring. They only called me back last week. 




 Thank you! I think I know my stuff, I've been going to this same shop for three years now, and sometimes get frustrated when the workers can't find something simple. 




 I agree so much, I hate more than anything when the head shop people can't find a simple brand of papes when it's right there. Last year the shop had an influx of hot, brainless female employees, recently they've been better. I don't think I'll fall into that. 




 Hello all! I usually just lurk and comment 'round these parts, but I have a question that I think you ladies will be able to answer better than /r/femalefashionadvice , even though this is usually their territory.

As the title says, I have a job interview at my head shop tomorrow morning, and I am at a complete loss as to what to wear. I know for regular interviews you want business casual, or at least nicer clothes. But the head shop is so different from every other employer I've had, and I want to work there so so badly. The people working are pretty strictly jeans and t-shirt, but I want to make an impression that doesn't scream "she's trying too hard." Even though they dress so casually, I'm still thinking nicer pants (because all my jeans are torn up/worn out) or a casual skirt + tights (because it'll be below freezing when I need to be there) and a t-shirt (probably a Slytherin one I have because it's my absolute favorite and I feel so wonderful in it), but I'm not sure if even that's too casual.

Thank you in advance, I know you ladies know how to help another entwife in need.

EDIT: I'm also meeting the owner (whom I've never met, even though the employees know me by name and know exactly what type of papes I want), and the interview is at 8:30am (not at all hard for me to be awake for).

tl;dr: I've got an interview at my local head shop tomorrow and I have no idea what to wear. HALP! Please.

EDIT 2: Thank you so much for the help, everyone. I had the interview this morning, ended up in the black pencil skirt + black tights + Slytherin t-shirt, and I think it went really well. If anything, I showed how punctual I am, because I was there 5 minutes before the interviewer. 




 Commenting to save this pattern. I usually hate amigurumis for some reason (possibly because I already own way too many stuffed animals for a 21-year-old), but this hits right in the childhood. 




 I have a beautiful coral eyeshadow that is sadly not very pigmented. However, it's perfect for dabbing on over concealer, under foundation. Kinda cancels out the purple blue (mine are a little green cause I'm really warm toned). 




 Hopefully you'll find a coat with long enough sleeves! I'm just here to say that long wrist warmers under mittens are wonderful for that awkward uncovered wrist. 




 My birthday is on the 28th, and my best friend's is Nov. 2. Birthday Halloweek has been a thing for us. This year we're 21, so it's basically just an excuse to dress up, get wasted, and eat our body weights in chocolate all week without any judgement. 




 Slutty Teddy Roosevelt. Don't have an SO, which is ok, because I don't think anyone will be able to outdo Slutty Teddy Roosevelt.

Part of the reason that's my costume is simply because I believe that the words "Slutty Teddy Roosevelt" should be said together as many times as possible. 




 Rimmel Lasting Finish lipstick in Pink Blush. I describe it as my baby prostitute lipstick, cuz that's what I feel like when I put it on. I always try it again every few months, and it's always just awful.

I generally feel like a baby prostitute if I try any pink lipstick, though. I'm sticking to red or bare from now on. 




 I really only have one pair of sneakers that I can wear. Since I'll have to walk to the venue and have really bad knees, cute shoes are pretty much never an option, sadly. 




 I'm going on a second date with a guy I really like tomorrow. We're going to a comedy show at night. What do I wear?

For background, I wore a white skirt, grey tights, a grey sweater, and a pink scarf for our first (coffee turned into early dinner) date, and am thinking pants for this one because it will be cold. I've got most of the basics, and I absolutely love cardigans. Would skinny jeans+cute printed t-shirt+cardigan be too casual? 




 I've gone through two pairs of 5fingers and I love them so much. I had a grey/bright blue pair that I wore nearly every day for three summers, and a grey/strange army-ish green pair that is nearing the end. 

I'm generally less concerned with how my feet look because (due to years joint damage) if I do, my knees/hips/back hurt badly enough to not get out of bed for a few days afterwards. However, I just treated my vibrams like any other shoe. The green pair works really well with all the earth tones I wear, and I think all black Mary Jane-style ones are some of the cutest things ever. They really don't look much different from other black shoes, and if someone is seriously disturbed by them, they need to figure out why feet are so "gross." 




 (Partially to deal with the oh-so tacky see-through leggings) I always wear two pairs of leggings, which usually makes them much warmer! 




 I'm not a vegetarian, but I often cook big dinners with my friends, many of whom are.

My favorite non-meat protein sources are edamame (green soybeans) and the combination of peas and pasta (together they make a complete protein.) Edamame is great because you can put some frozen beans in tupperware and they'll be thawed and the perfect temperature by lunch.

 I made it a little too strong, and I love the triple bitterness. 




 I wanted a picture of it, but didn't want to risk getting my phone wet. Be assured, it was drunk in the shower. 




 It takes the refreshing part of showers added to the refreshing part of drinks. 




 Shower Gin and Tonic is even more refreshing! 




 You got it! 




 The gin was brown. Would have preferred the clear kind, but lack of funds means you gotta go with plastic bottle Seagrams.

I'm a little afraid to try it in my new apartment because the water doesn't get very hot and sometimes I'm a little bitch when it comes to lukewarm showers. 




 I'm going as slutty Teddy Roosevelt. Because.

 IU ent (born and raised just outside Bloomington) here, the college towns are oases of intelligence in a bass-ackwards sea of methed out ignorance. 




 I don't forsee a democratic governor in my lifetime. Moving the hell out of this state as soon as humanly possible. 




 I've never understood how calling me independent is supposed to be an insult. 




 1) seriously, go to class.

2) take anything and everything that seems interesting, at least at first, to find something you're really passionate about. I'm a junior picking up Arabic because I like languages.

3) read for class and do your homework. 

4) learn to take good notes. This means (at least for me) outline style, with the main points copied from the PowerPoint and subheadings from discussion.

5) no matter how dumb you think you might sound, speak up in class. This is especially important in language classes, because it allows your professor to help you with pronunciation and grammar.

6) eat dinner at Collins. Or just go to Collins as often as possible. But I'm biased on that front (lived there for two years).

7) take a class with Aurelian Craiutu. Seriously, this guy is the best there is. He's Political Science, but teaches other classes, too. He will challenge you and won't accept bullshit. I took Modern Political Thought with him last semester and am taking Classical in the fall (Y382   381, respectively), but he also does a class on happiness that I want to take so badly.

8) don't commit dormcest. It WILL be awkward.

9) your UD advisor is going to be shitty, no matter what. Deal with it, cuz you won't need him/her for long.

10) DON'T. EVER. SMOKE. WEED. IN. YOUR. DORM. ROOM. EVEREVEREVEREVER.

Edit: 11) get a job at some point, even if it's just for a summer. You don't want to graduate with a four-year-old resume, or worse, no resume at all.
