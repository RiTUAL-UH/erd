 I had more or less the same thing happen to my relationship with my ex. She actually did end up leaving me for someone else and now I have lost my best friend. 

OP I would caution against it based on my personal experience. I'm sure that it could work out for you but for me it ended really badly and led to a lot of resentment. She just could never truly see me as more than a friend and I spent the last half of the relationship feeling like a place holder. All the best, good luck. 




 thanks, I was feeling a little of it today, but not as much by any means. I just felt really out of sorts last night and was irritable and scared so I went to the hospital. I probably wasted their time, but I was feeling pretty bad last night. 




 Right on thanks for sharing. I know personally that I have a lot of the symptoms of a person suffering from bipolar disorder, but like you they seem to think my agitation states are anxiety based. I'm having a bit of a hard time taking their word for it because they even admit there is a similarity. My pdoc has also told me that I'm probably Obsessive only OCD. 




 Do you mind if I ask what your diagnosis is? do you just have depression? I'm sort of afraid that my reaction might be a result of something worse. 




 I started the abilify about a month ago at 2 mg, but they bumped me up to a couple of weeks ago. Since then I experienced exactly what you did, feeling like the bones in my legs were trying to escape or that my skin was crawling. I couldn't sit down because my legs were jittery. I have an appointment with my Pdoc on thursday, but I'm not taking any more ability till then. I didn't take it after getting back from the hospital last night and I've had no restlessness or irritability. 




 Went to the hospital last night because I was having a severe panic attack and couldn't stop my legs from moving. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been prescribed 5mg of abilify and 45 mg of mirtazapine for anxiety and depression. For the last few days I haven't been able to get my legs to stop moving and have been having terrible anxiety that's keeping me awake. You know the kind where it's everything stupid you've ever done all at once. Anyway I had a panic attack and drove myself to the hospital because I felt very out of sorts. They prescribed me seroquel on top of what I'm already dealing with so that I could get to sleep. I was just wondering if there are other people here who have experience using anti-psychotics to fight depression and anxiety. Do my doctors think I have something worse and are just not telling me yet? Do you have any experience with abilify or seroquel? 




 Yup, that's what it's like exactly. I felt like I no master what me and everyone else did it was all trivial 




 Hi /r/depression. I've found during my battles with depression that I tend to devalue everything around me in an effort to manage my negative emotions. I criticize family, friends, my own interests, basically everything in an effort to bring things down to my level (not on purpose but it still happens.) Have any of you experienced this? I think it's a kind of anhedonia where I not only don't find pleasure in things but I have to devalue them as well. Sort of like there must be a reason I don't get pleasure from those things or people anymore. If any of you share this kind of behaviour I'd love to hear from you. Thanks. 




 my bad, was meant for /r/depression  thanks
 




 Hi /r/depression so here's my story. Me and my ex girlfriend broke up last may, it was a bad split she started dating again very soon afterward. I was dealing with a serious episode of depression that I'm still fighting and was made worse by the breakup. Towards the end of the relationship there were a some bad fights, suffice it to say my depression had a lot to do with why we weren't working. 

Since then I've moved back home with my parents so I can get my head on straight. After months of not talking to each other me and my ex are working on our friendship again and seeing where that goes. She brought up if I was seeing anybody else and I told her I wasn't, that I needed to get my head on straight first. I also told her that I might be moving back to the same city as her and she seemed excited by that news. 

The conversation really got me thinking, will I ever be okay enough to really be in a relationship with someone else? I feel like my partner consumes me and I become a codependant mess. I didn't even know who I was after me and my ex split we'd been together so long. 

It really scares me, I have bad anxiety too and I can't stop thinking of everything I've ever done wrong, even going back to kindergarden, my memory is a real curse. I want to be able to be there for someone else and have a real relationship someday, but I'm afraid I'll just fall apart again and won't know it until it's too late. 

What am I supposed to do? I lost my perfect girl to this disease I'm fighting, I don't know what to say to people when they ask how I'm doing, I feel cloudy all the time because of the medication I'm on. 

I suffered from depression and anxiety as a child and through my teenage years, there may have been one year in the last 10 that I haven't felt depressed (basically 10 onward I've been struggling) I don't know what normal feels like, am I so broken? I just don't know what to do or say anymore. 

I wish I could fix things with my ex, but I need to fix me first, and I don't know how long that'll take. I wish I could go back to school but I'm afraid the stress might kill me. I don't know it's all too much.

If any of you have been in a similar circumstance please lend some advice, I'm so far up a creek without a paddle I'm pretty much looking at the ocean.  




 wasn't indoors, was next to the garage. still bad. 




 I have depression and have been thinking about everything I've ever done wrong so here is the whole god damn fucking list of things I can't get out of my head.

Number 1. 
- When I was younger I was really really insecure and wanted to impress other kids, especially moving to a new town and not knowing many people. I never hit anyone but I did get in a few scuffles with kids who didn't deserve it because other kids were egging me on. Man I felt so bad, because I know what it's like to get picked on. FUCK. I'm sorry. 13 years old

Number 2. Told off some kids at soccer practice because they were being jerks about another kids accent. I was super mean and one of them started crying. Their parents heard me.  8 years old

 
Number 3. Made fun of a handicap kid once because he was acting out and making a scene. His sister heard what I said and started crying. FUCK FUCK FUCK. I'm sorry. 11 years old

Number 4. Once I went on a trip to Europe but our plane got delayed for stupid reasons so I missed a day on the trip and I got pissed at the lady at the airport who seriously couldn't have done anything about it. Didn't make a bit of a scene. FUCK. 16 years old.

Number 5. Trying to impress people, I cheated in my fourth grade chess tournament. Everyone knew I did too. Still lost. 10 years old.

Number 6. Made fun of a kid in front of his mom (who was a substitute teacher) she made me explain why I did that to her. Didn't know she was in ear shot. FUCK.

Number 7. Had a stupid obsession crush on a girl when I was fourteen. When she went to the dance with another guy after turning down my invitation I cried in the bathroom. damn it.

Number 8. Moved again, trying to impress people. Told a bunch of lies which include. Saying I had a friend who committed suicide. Saying I had friends who did all kinds of drugs before moving. I'm such an idiot. fourteen years old.

Number 9. Lit a copy of "The Pearl" by john Steinbeck on fire (with gasoline) for being too straight forward with it's meaning and just a miserable book. Almost burned down my parent's garage. 16 years old.

Number 10. While drunk described to my ex girlfriend's mom how I would have liked to beat up my ex's childhood friend for being such an ass on the school trip to Europe (It was holocaust tour he was an ass). Made a horrible impression. 17 years old.

Number 11. Spent a summer at my Aunt's place was a moody angry teenager the whole time. Watched porn on the family computer, which they all completely knew about. Lied about where I was going sometimes. 15 years old.  Damn it.

Number 12. When george bush visited my state I was in class and watching it on tv, when the motorcade went by the cameras I said "common snipers!" teacher screamed at me. I was a very opinionated 12 year old. I got sent to the principle's office. 12 years old

Number 13. Got drunk and chased my friends around, got sick and made a scene. 16 years old.

Number 14. Lied about going to a concert, when asked about specifics by someone who went I lied and they called me out on not going. So fucking awful. 19 years old.

Anyway that's all I've got for now FUCK. 




 yeah I'm on medication now, and I've been feeling much better. I've also been exercising and doing mindfulness meditation so I can be very aware of how I'm feeling. 




 I guess I'm really trying to figure out which part of the anger was "me" and which part was caused by the depression. It was very out of character for me to act in that way. I accept that I'm always responsible. I guess I'm more interested in cause and identity. 




 I was hesitant starting off, but I'm feeling a lot better about it. My thoughts are clearer, I'm sleeping better, I have an appetite again, I'm not being overly irritated or angry at my loved ones and I haven't experienced any side effects that I've noticed. So it feels great to not be as angry, I feel like I'm getting back to my old self. The therapy is helping a lot too, but I'm functioning now in the meantime.  




 yeah I'm in therapy and on medication. Since I've been on medication I've been very collected and haven't gotten angry whatsoever. Everyone says that it's so out of character for me. 




 because I feel guilty and embarrassed. I know I'm responsible, but more is it objectively a result of the depression. I was never like this when not depressed. I guess I'm just trying to figure out where that behaviour came from and to hear other people's experience with it. 




 You're entirely right. 




 I've had a few anger/rage episodes which both my psychologist and psychiatrist have said are a result of my depression. I've lashed out at some people close to me and I feel a great amount of guilt about what happened. I know it's not an excuse for my actions by any means, but how responsible do you think we are for anger as a result of our depression. Is it really "us" or is it the depression? 




 Seriously, depression can cause this, my depression caused me to be a complete asshole for almost an entire year to my now ex-gf. I honestly didn't know what I was dealing with, I was too busy/stressed to care. I didn't take care of myself, was agressive, and generally frustrated/pissed off. Seriously talk to him about this, I know for me a lot of my anger was a kind of call for help. Don't jump to conclusions, but sit down and talk to him about it. Seeing a counsellor would probably help the situation either way. 




 Hey man, we've got similar stories. My depression and the anger it caused definitely led to the end of my relationship with my girlfriend. I had a whole week were I basically fell of the face of the earth after we had some fights. It's a rough road man, I wish my girlfriend had come back, but at the same time I don't think I'm in any state to date right now. 




 I feel like I'm a different species all the time. The only way I can function is by putting up a front, it's pretty miserable. 




 I'm dealing with pretty bad depression, that for the most part stems from those kind of reactions. I always think of all the stupid things I've done and it just brings me down.
 




 Yea, I'm much more reeled in than I was at a young age. Unless I've been drinking, but I think that's just because it takes my anxiety away. 




 yup that's it exactly, I would be really hesitant to meet anybody but as soon as that passed I'd be overly friendly and energetic. Usually resulting in being called weird or annoying. 




 Has your anxiety ever caused you to act out? I can remember from a very young age always trying to impress other people because I felt a huge amount of anxiety regarding "fitting in." I'd do stuff just a little bit over the top so that people would recognize me, or I'd inflate stories in an attempt to get people to like me. All of my acting out of course led only to more anxiety. 




 It feels like a weight pushing down on me just enough to make me hate everything. It makes my thoughts loud, cold, and for the most part logical. I don't cry, it's just numbness, it feels like pressure. You know that feeling you get when you know you've hurt yourself badly like a deep cut or really bad bruise and it's so bad you can't even feel it, well it's like that all the time. Sometimes I get sick of feeling like this, I can only take stuffing it down so long, I used to get angry quite a lot, not these days but I used to. It was just a horrible alternative to feeling nothing. 




 I have a very hard time relating to people my own age, it's pretty miserable. I can remember being 10 and the only people who I really enjoyed talking to were my teachers. It's still sort of that way, I've been asked to have coffee and chat by a few of my professors because they don't feel I'm operating at an undergraduate level. I can't really relate to the whole "college life" experience or people my own age because I feel like  I've already moved passed that part of my life.

I'd probably trade the intelligence and wisdom/hyper-awareness for better sociability and happiness. I'm not sure that I can have both intelligence and happiness, I just wish I got along better with people. 




 Classical piano for 15 years. I need music as a stress relief and have realized that it has to remain that way for me. I tried some university education with music and although I did very well my perfectionism ruined it for me and I couldn't listen to music for almost a year afterwards.  




 I was going to say "My body is a cage" but it was already posted. "If I Ever Feel Better" by Phoenix is pretty accurate.
