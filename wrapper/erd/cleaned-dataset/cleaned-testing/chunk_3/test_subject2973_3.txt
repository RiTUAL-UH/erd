 I'm sure people who kill can not control their rage during the moment of the kill, unless you speak of sociopaths or psychopaths who enjoy that moment. During this moment of the kill murderer's do not care about what troubles they will run into in the future. 'Normal' murderers realize the ramifications only after their acts; this is why 'normal' murderers run away from the scene of the crime or attempt to dispose of the body and the evidence,  obviously not very well  since they are caught fairly 'fast' unlike serial killers whom are caught only after a spree. 

Allowing the victims family to deal with the murderer is a primitive idea, because who is to say that the murderer's family will not go and kill someone in the victim's family?  These codes /rules/ laws exist in real life. For example if you look at Albania they have this code called the kanun, which dictates punishment like this.  When someone is killed by someone else then someone from the victim's family must seek revenge to honor the dead. This goes on until the males of the family is wiped out. However people stopped following the Kanun and do things their own way! 

 Following rules like you propose in your comment is destructive towards society because their will be retaliatory killings amongst the victim's family and the murderer's family. The victim's family becomes the murderer to the eyes of of the original murderer's family and then this family becomes the victim.  Not only is the community affected emotionally but the economic ramifications far out weigh the benefits because their will be a lack of people to work and stimulate the economy as a whole. 

Even with strict rules to your proposition, the rules will not be an exegesis hence people will do as pleased. People will bend the rules and find loop holes.
