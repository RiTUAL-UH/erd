  Remember the reason the Soviet Union failed, and that there was no food on the shelves, is that nobody wanted to work. Incentivization was gone.

The important thing to remember is that UBI is giving people just enough to cover their basic needs. Something like $1,000 per month. There's still plenty of incentive to work, as very few people would be comfortable with $12,000 per year. I know I sure wouldn't. 




 Ha. Remember when toolbars were a thing? 




 If you got $1000 for free every month would you stop working? 




 Old people vote. Young people don't. That's why the country is considerably more liberal than the government. 




 We've needed this for so long (even if it's as simple as [this](http://i.imgur.com/Y792nwi.jpg)), especially since we've got two ults to choose from, usually based on comp, not to mention the other talents. 




 I like this idea, though it'd require publicly funded elections as well, since the corruption that currently plagues our political system would not be resolved by taking away government salaries. 




 /r/gogopgo 




 [This](https://youtu.be/ecIBE8zNimw?t=10m34s) should be easier. 




 Imagine that. 




 I still don't understand how openly opposing net neutrality isn't political suicide. It's 2015. Being against a free, open, and unconstrained internet is like being anti-puppy.

I suppose it helps that most of their voting base is using AOL (if anything), but still. Wow. 




 She sounds like the sorcerer's apprentice. 




 Downvoted, not for being wrong, but for the weird hybrid question/statement sentence. 




 Well one shot, one kill met. 




 I noticed that, too. 




  Just mute and move on.

Words to live by. 




 Good call, especially about the boss part. I should do a separate post about not doing mercs because they're there. It's gotten (understandably) really bad since launch, wherein I find myself answering "Boss?" where they're all up and we're down a person with a "No!" quite frequently.

The other merc camps can be just as bad, too, especially with heroes that can't clear them quickly (which includes Sylvanas, people). I can't tell you how many times I've seen a wipe caused by one person doing mercs for no reason while the rest of the team is fighting 4v5 (usually over a temple or a tribute). 




 If you lose someone before the team fight really even begins, disengage. Don't fight. One person down sucks, go do something productive instead of seeing how many kills you can feed them.

This one drives me crazy. It's such a simple, obvious combat, but I can't tell you how many times I've seen idiotic team members dash in to start a fight right after we lose someone.

"I'll avenge you!" No. You won't. You'll just wipe the team. 




  If both teams go 4-1 then you're both just mutually deciding to exploit each other in the same way, and then either team has an option to change things up to mitigate the other team's strategy.

Yes. If both teams go 4-1, neither has the advantage (from a lane setup perspective), but if one team doesn't, then the 4-1 will have the advantage. So with 4-1, the worst case scenario is no advantage, best case you've got a significant advantage.

I don't see why going 3-2 couldn't do fine against that depending on the comp.

They might be fine, but they're playing at a disadvantage. As I said, the lane with 2 in it isn't doing anything the lane of 1 isn't, and now the lane of 3 is down a person that might secure a kill, prevent a death, etc.. 




  kill your 2
 That's kind of a big assumption, isn't it? Why can't the 2 at bottom just play really passively, soak, poke, and NOT DIE?

You're right. They can do exactly that. And in that case, you just keep them bottled up and wait for a good opportunity, making sure all 3 lanes are soaking. 




 Yeah, it's 4-1 before the mines, then all 5 in the same entrance for the mines, then all 5 killing the golem (unless your golem is huge). From there in theory you'd go back to 4-1, but that rarely happens. It's mostly just the start of the game. 




 What part don't you follow? 




 Sadly, I think this has been happening for years in various parts around the country. 




 Ha, fair enough. 




 How do you deal with a 1-1-3, wherein the solo top just soaks while the 3 bot kill your 2, secure the shrine, and then rotate up? 




  PSA: Soak until 10, prioritise team fight above 10.

Agreed. 




 Very true, and very good. 




 It's a matter of who votes. The older you are, the more likely you are to vote, and the less likely you are to support legalization. That's why the country is far more liberal than the government is. 




 If the 3 is on top it's pretty reasonable. 




  I'm one of those Californians who never has, and never will smoke pot. But I would vote to legalize it because I'm convinced it doesn't hurt society, but enforcing pot laws does.

Same on all counts (except being a Californian). 




 Had to solo bot with Johanna in my last game (on Blackheart's) because Sylvanas went top :(.

Johanna's fantastic in a solo lane (because she's unkillable, and she has great wave clear), and I even managed to out-push the Zagara against me, but still. It was Sylvanas... 




 How is that bullshit? That's what they're reporting... 




 When in actuality it's "free market", "small government" republicans. Well that and the alcohol, for-profit prison, and other lobbyists helping them get re-elected. 




 I don't know of a reason not to do 2-1-2 (or maybe 1-3-1) on the spider queen map. Would be interested to hear if anyone knows otherwise. 




 A significant 437 megawatts of solar panels were installed in the first quarter, which was a 76 percent increase from the first quarter of 2014, said the report.

Your profits grew by 437 megawatts ;) 




 What the hell was that? Everything of substance was edited out of the video. 




 Grats!

Share some tips? 




 People shouldn't quit, period. I can't tell you how many games I've seen where one team has been way, way down the entire game, only to come back for a sudden, crazy victory. The only commonality between all of those games is that no one on the team that came back stopped trying.

Also, it's a game, and games are about having fun. Even I'm the only one up with the entire enemy team and a 100 skull totem on our core, I still try and get that last kill for fun.

Anyone who surrenders is denying their team a chance at a comeback, and themselves the opportunity to enjoy the game a little more. 




 Feel the hatred of 10,000 hues! 




 Well fought. I concede. 




 The progressives are the ones fighting for legalization. It's the right's voting base that's against it. 




  he can hop his ass on the next slow boat to Cuba.

Actually, [he can't](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/gop-led-house-votes-restrictions-travel-cuba-31529147). 




 Thanks for sharing this. 




 When it suits them. 




  it's annoying as @%!$.

FTFY 




 Only when it suits them. 




 I see what you did there. 




 Wait, you mean Frostbolt can be used on minions and the enemy hero as well? 




 He's not. Nobody actually paying attention favors keeping it illegal. He's just in some industry's pocket: Alcohol, for-profit prisons, cartels, etc.. Those are really the only people hurt (and, more importantly, not tremendously helped) by legalization, so they're the ones paying to keep it illegal. 




  Yes, a lot more people smoke pot, openly.

FTFY 




  Wait, so a Republican candidate is promising to stomp all over state's rights if he gets elected? Either I'm missing something here or he is a even bigger moron than I already thought he was.

What you're missing is that republicans are for states rights and smaller government only when it aligns with what they want. They have no problems with the government oppressing gay rights, waging a counterproductive war on drugs, subsidizing fossil fuels, etc.. 




 Contacted the mods. Seems it was a mistake of some sort and they've fixed it.

Thanks for pointing this out. 




 Not going to go into it, but if you do even a small bit of research, you'll see there are many strong reasons for legalization, and more importantly that keeping it illegal causes some huge problems. I'd suggest you look into the issue a little deeper. 




 Ah, and then 20 is "Hero of the Storm"? 




 Thanks. I wasn't sure what the pattern was. 




 Not necessarily. I don't think that Zagara's hydralisks preclude the possibility of a hydralisk hero, for example, and don't forget that Tyrael and the Angelic Valla skin both exist. 




 Sorry, thought I'd stripped the timestamp out :( 




 That was super fun. Loved the music.

If you do another, maybe cut down on the number/duration of the ones that just throw things at the spawn point. Didn't find that as interesting, but the rest was great.

Well done. 




 I've been with and loved Google's ecosystem ever since Gmail launched, though I didn't switch to Android until about a year ago. I always liked my iPhones (3G, 4, and then 5), and only switched because I dropped and shattered my 5 mid-contract. I figured since I was so embedded in Google's ecosystem anyway, I'd see what the fuss was all about.

So I got a Moto X 2013, and was struck right away how much faster, smoother, and reliable my iPhone 5 was, despite the fact that it was 1.5 years older. I was really amazed how buggy Android is. Apps crashed all the time, I had huge problems connecting to Bluetooth devices, Chromecast doesn't work nearly as well as it did in my iPhone (which is not at all what you'd expect), and it's slow as hell.

Over time I've kind of gotten used to it, and I must say that a lot of the issues have gotten better. iOS is still a much smoother and user friendly experience. Any time I use my wife's 3 year old iPhone 5, I'm blown away by how responsive, fast, and fluid it is. Android still hasn't caught up in that regard. It's not even close.

The other thing that really sucks is the fragmentation and lack of updates. I chose the Moto-X because everyone said it would get fast updates. It took 2 months to go from 4.4.2 to 4.4.4 (we never got 4.4.3 at all), and I'm at about 6 months waiting on Android 5. It's also not nearly a customizatable as I'd heard. You can specify default apps for actions, which is nice, and I'm sure that if I jumped through some hoops and found some homebrew solutions to things, I could make a few things happen how I like, but most of the time if I want to change something, there's no solid solution to do it. The phone unlocks a lot in my pocket, for example, and I wanted to change the slide mechanism to be more like iOS's, wherein it goes the whole width of the phone and in only one direction. Nope. Not possible.

All in all, Android is pretty rough and it has some huge flaws and shortcomings compared to iOS.

That said, I don't think I'll ever go back, and it comes down to three things:

1. The ecosystem. This really is number one. I can tie everything together, and my devices can talk to each other. Everything ties in through my Google account, and it's really great.
2. It does more. While iOS does many things better than Android, it simply doesn't have the same capabilities. This isn't a huge deal, but it is something that I've learned to appreciate.
3. The things that it does better, it does WAY better. Maps, voice control, cross-app integration, etc..

So while I don't love Android, I am happy that I switched. If it weren't for the ecosystem, I'd probably go back, but Apple's ecosystem is terrible, so here I stay.

I hope this helps, and if you have any specific questions, feel free to ask. 




 More Starcraft and Diablo characters, particularly more zerg, protoss, and angels. 




 Wall is picked quite often. Used properly under the right conditions it is considerably more powerful than archon. 




 Can confirm. Archon definitely cannot kill a friendly Valla that quickly. 




 IT FUCKING HAPPENED. THEY CALLED THE GAME "DONE" WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC CHARACTERS, THE FUCKING ARCHANGEL OF JUSTICE, ESSENTIALLY DOESN'T HAVE A HEROIC TRAIT!

5% DAMAGE REDUCTION, THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE TO DO. IT'S NOT OP, IT'S PROBABLY EVEN WORSE THAN HIS CURRENT TRAIT, BUT YOU'D NEVER LOOK BACK ON A GAME AND THINK "MY TRAIT DID NOTHING".

'CAUSE AS A TYRAEL MAIN, RIGHT NOW MY TRAIT DOES NOTHING.

DELAUNCH AND FIX IMMEDIATELY! 




 How about summoned creatures, like Zagara's hydralisk? Do any of them award experience? 




 I had no idea. Thanks! 




 Great little story. 




 Really? 




 First four are great. Hell no to mind flay. Your hand is, and should be, sacred. 




 I tried AMD the last time around. The thing that guaranteed that I will never make that mistake again was the fact that nearly every time I updated my drivers, I had problems. It got so bad that I would go 6 months between updates, because I didn't want to deal with the hassle. 

Now that I'm back with Nvidia, I update every month. It takes 1 minute, no reboot, no problems.  




 Swimming, definitely. Swimsuits are pointless and awful. 




 Seriously, these 2 universes are also part of Heroes of the Storm

Technically true.

not just Warcraft

Actually true (sadly). 




 Thanks. Of course. 




 Thanks. I appreciate your support. 




 Guess which quest I just got. 




 Old people vote, young people don't, and thus the country is significantly more liberal than its representation. 




 No deal. Assassin is my least favorite role.

I actually really do like supports and specialists, I've just kind of overdone them due to all of these quests and I'd love to play some warrior (my favorite). 




  they aren't going to let you reroll your quest until you get a quest that lets you play the same one hero you always pick.

Two things:

1. I play tons of different characters. I don't have a "character that I always pick".
2. I've gotten practically (maybe even literally) nothing but specialist and support quests for the past week. The reason for this post is because I'm sick of playing those two roles (both of which I normally enjoy, but it's getting a little crazy). The current system isn't exactly diversifying things for me. 




 Not so! RCV's already in place around the country, and growing, thanks largely (though not entirely) to [citizen intiatives](http://www.pressherald.com/2014/11/12/ranked-choice-voting-advocates-gathered-36000-signatures-on-election-day/). Much like marijuana legalization. 




  the only way we have a chance of doing anything about it is if we start managing to elect unelectable politicians.

They're only unelectable because [we're using a sucky electoral system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo list=PL-cJs8aiZ912jQj_X1i91gvc1gbkCc0FD). 




 I miss the square of the 90's, when the games were great, and the titles made sense.

Though to be fair, while Type-0 HD is awful, nothing will ever beat Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days. You gotta wonder if someone just dropped a coffee mug on the keyboard, and thought "Sure, that's the title". 




 You gotta wonder what the harm is in giving us an approximate time. Yes some people will be mad *if* the time slips, but everyone *is* mad that we're all just sitting here hitting refresh. If I were Blizzard, I'd take the possible heat over the definite. 




 Just watched this and can't help but think that the same people being screwed by this massive chicken corporations are almost undoubtedly voting for the republicans fighting the regulations that could protect them from these abuses. 




 I love these so much. Can't wait for specialist! 




 I wonder how many talk show hosts they polled. There can't be that many of them. 




  Obviously those tactics are not working, as the gap keeps growing larger.

But we're not doing those things. We raise the minimum wage very infrequently, certainly not keeping up with inflation, and the rich seem to get a new tax break every week.

Seems to me like we're doing the opposite of those things, and *that's* why the gap is growing. 




 I believe the loan is unaffected by the tax rebate. So you'd still owe the bank (or whomever) $20k, but you'd pay $6k less in taxes, so you could put that, which would normally have gone to taxes, towards the loan. 




 June 1st? 




 Yeah, I've thought about Rehgar front-loading his re-mount CD as well. Edge cases, but not nothing.

I was joking about the keys, I would probably bind it to CTRL+Z or something. I've never intentionally dismounted (except maybe to dance before the game starts), but you never know. 




 Contact your local democratic party. They'll point you in the right direction. 




 My hopes for launch are the same for every patch for about as long as I've been playing:

1. A Tyrael trait rework.
2. Judgement's many bugs being fixed.
3. The ability to bind the mount and dismount commands to different keys. Mount I'll keep on Z, and I think dismount will move to CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F8+Scroll Lock. Because why would I ever want to go slower?

Not asking for much, but sadly I've been asking for a long time. 




 I hope this turns out to be true, but who's not playing yet that wants to? There have been excess keys floating around for months. I don't see a big flood of new players coming.

But I hope I'm wrong. 




 Thank you for translating, and for Blizzard for giving the noobs some very easy characters for launch week. Can't screw that list up too badly. No Nova, Illidan, Abathur, or Hammer. 




 Got one in my neighborhood, too.

Prices are falling rapidly. We'll have ours soon enough. 




 Didn't notice that. My bad. 




 Agreed. They rage so hard when you do this, but anyone who thinks a 2v4 is a good idea is probably going to find something to rage about eventually. 




 Didn't notice that until you pointed it out. No idea. Weird. 




 I think that statistic speaks more towards the owners than the dogs. 




 Seems fitting. Small heals are kind of Tyrande's thing. 




 Thanks. I wondered the same thing. 




 It's a child, either literally or emotionally. Just report and don't give him a second of your time. 




 Two things:

First, EVERYONE is talking about Anub'arak. Constantly.

Second...

but a 61% Anub is untouched.

It hasn't even been 3 weeks. I'm sure Blizzard is aware of how ~~kinky~~powerful Anub'arak has become, but it would be pretty rash of them to make an adjustment so quickly. 




 Or even better, do both! 




 Kinda hard for the homeless to make use of solar panels...

Glibness aside, I take your point, that they could be giving that money to someone even more needy. I think the idea is that it's an investment. Sort of a "teach a man to fish" kind of thing, wherein the value of the solar panels over time will grow beyond the initial cost, thus the recipients get more bang for the state's buck. 




 I get (and very much like) this:

Every 6 weeks to launch two heroes.

But can anyone decipher this part:

The current plan is that after all will be made every 6 weeks may contain two new heroes of the big patch, one of the heroes of the patch while online, while the other is unlocked after a period of time the patch. (like Johanna) 




 Solar panels work when it's not sunny, too. Just not as well. 




 I do this a lot, too, trying to maximize my laning time as best as I can, based on the situation. 




 Correct. 




 I try and do this on my when when I've got a health globe talent and a hero that I feel can pull it off without missing out on experience or putting myself at risk. Tyrael, for example, can bring down a wave quickly, as well as use his Q to get there in time.

Often only possible on the smaller maps, like the tomb or Dragonshire, and doing this can also be a bit of a mana drain, but if you can pull it off, it helps a lot. 




 Thank you. 




 The damage is nice, but incidental. The silence is the team killer. 




 Just as long as nobody who has ever worked on NCIS is involved.  




 I'd be happy if they simply sorted alphabetically by default. I never find myself wanting to sort by release date.

Even better would be if it remembered the sorting and filters. So if I sort by price and come back to the store, it's still sorted by price. 




  Why do you feel like you need to be rewarded for every step

That's a bit of a stretch. I said when you hit 60 with a class. That's hardly "every step".

Anyway, most of us don't care about golden cards we're never going to use. As such, it's not really a reward, and I think hitting 60 is a significant accomplishment that the user should be rewarded for. 




  Loki is kind of a special case: I may change Loki's wording, but I never change his mind.

This is awesome, and I think that this is exactly what makes you such a great writer. 




 Making good use of that golden Dalaran Mage, are you? 




 There's the "pro life party of small government" in action. 




 Very pretty. Nice job! 




 Somewhere around $80-90. A bundle or two and a few heroes. 




 * A useful Tyrael trait
* The ability to bind the dismount button to something other than the mount button
* Spectator Mode
* More Diablo heroes 




 Since you're a first-timer, you should call-ahead and let them know you're coming anyway, and that would be a great time to ask. Takes the guess work out of it. 




 His parents knew, early on, that diarrheafarts88 was destined for greatness. 




 First of all, you're a fantastic writer, and I can't wait to see what you're working on next.

My question is, how do you strike the balance between a character doing what would be natural for him/her, and with what you need them to do to further the plot or a particular part of the story? And for that matter, who would you say is more in charge: you or the characters?

Thanks, and keep up the great work! 




 Yeah. Every hero has a trait, which is usually (but not always) a passive ability that helps set them apart. Diablo's soulstones, Nova/Zeratul's cloaking, Kerrigan's shield generation, etc..

Tyrael does have one (I was just being bitter), his explodey angel death bomb, but it's both terrible and practically non-existent. Everyone is begging for Blizzard to replace it with something that actually affects the game, and that doesn't reward Tyrael for doing his job poorly.

As far as buying him, I highly recommend him, as he's both fun and power, though he is somewhat of a challenging hero to play effectively. Unlike Diablo, Muradin, ETC, etc., who can just jump in, push the enemy around, and take a beating, Tyrael requires a a good bit of judgement (plenty of pun intended) to know when to initiate and press an attack. And you really have to be diligent keeping an eye on your back line, since you don't really have a hard disengage.

That said, when you do get a feel for him, you can really punish the enemy for their greed and foolishness. Smart enemies learn very quickly if the Tyrael that they're facing is dangerous and treat him with respect. Weak enemies simply face justice and die.

And that's why I love him. 




 Do you wear a two-piece to go swimming? 




 How about free arena run every time you hit level 60 with a class, so there actually a reason to do it. 




 it's super lucrative.

For the gangs, cartels, and for-profit prisons, maybe. For the rest of us, it's super costly, both in taxes and in lost/destroyed lives. 




 Here's the GDC talk about what they did and the positive effects it had:

http://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player

Really fascinating stuff. 




 All you do by prematurely declaring a loss is make it more likely to happen. There is no situation where demoralizing your team is a good idea, particularly when you're already down. 




 I'm not. It's really quite easy to stay alive in a lane that's pushed, as you're never far from your towers, and usually behind them. You just soak safely and bring down the wave as fast as you can, weakening it in advanced with ranged AoE, if you can. The towers take minimal damage, you're at almost no risk, and the other lanes have the safety/advantage of large numbers.

This is what the solo lane on haunted mines usually does against 4 enemy heroes. It's particularly annoying when people don't know to do this and you end up 2-3, which puts the group lane down a person (3v1 instead of 4v1), and there's very little difference between a 1v4 and a 2v4, except that the lane doesn't push as hard and you're actually at more risk. 




 Great idea and tips!

When Riot did this, they saw toxicity in league drop noticeably. 




 Tyrael. Total badass. If only he had a hero trait. 




 We're funding both sides of the "war on drugs", and it's super frustrating. 




 You are a good person. 




  The car doesn't support Android Auto

And sadly it sounds like there are no plans to. Though they said that this is because they want to go "another way" with phone integration. We'll see what that means, I suppose. 




 Does he have the authority to do that? 




 I see your point, but I very much disagree that a 2-mana Shield Bearer sucks as much for the mage as a turn 3 Cairne sucks for the opponent. The former is slightly unfortunate, the latter is incredibly powerful. 




 Pretty sure. Maybe he lunges and stands around while he waits for the next auto attack to be ready? 




 I've seen some really outrageous combinations of ranks. One game our team had one 30+, and then something like two 1's, a 3, and an 8, and under, and the other team was all around 15. They're absolutely crazy.

I think the game tries to match based on what it thinks your rank *should* be. Frankly, if they're going to do it that way, they should do it like Starcraft 2 does it. You're in various leagues, bronze through diamond/master, and when the system thinks you're ready to move up, you do. I think if HotS did it this way, you'd settle on a more appropriate rank much quicker, and you'd end up with fewer huge variances in skill/rank.

At the very least I think they should do away with the "skill based" matchmaking and stick with simple rank based matching, at least until they can do a better job determining "skill". 




 Nothing. I was being sarcastic, because the Lollipop update is taking forever (going on 6 months) and they periodically say they're "preparing the update", which doesn't seem to mean anything. 




 This is amazing. I know nothing about tools, machining, engineering, or really anything, but I'm enthralled and have learned already.

Thanks for sharing this! 




 As someone who made the decision to get the 2013 based promises of "fast updates", and is going on 6 months of waiting for Lollipop, I am not. 




 With any luck, they'll be preparing to do the update, for the third time, this week! 




 Nice job!

Auriel is one of the characters that I'm most looking forward to. 




 Buying politicians.  




 I think society's views on nudity are super fucked up. We're taught to be ashamed of our bodies and that nudity is equivalent to sex. Furthermore, the very definition of "nudity" is really confusing. Why is a topless man totally innocent, but a topless woman is something obscene and inherently sexual. And then even going one step further, why is it the nipple, specifically, that is the "dirty part"? And why are we mature about some nudity (locker rooms, the doctor's office, etc.), knowing full well that it isn't sexual, but swimming naked is only something you do on a dare, and if you're caught, you're arrested and labeled a sex offender?

It's all just a bunch of stupid arbitrary rules, some of which are blatantly sexist double standards, based on Victorian prudishness that have caused severe psychological damage on a societal level. That may sound overstated, until you remember that "nip slips" are not only a thing, but there are entire websites built and monetized around them. Or even worse, there are some that consider breastfeeding to be something shameful that must remain hidden. We've latched on to these ridiculous Victorian principals, and the result is infants eating in public restrooms.

Here's another gem of a societal norm: (female) nipples, vaginas, penises, and butts are to be hidden at all time. So if you go swimming, to avoid people looking at them, place a small strip of brightly colored cloth to cover only those areas, specifically the color of those areas, because the shape is anything but concealed once wet. That will surely draw attention away from them, and take the sexuality out of the situation! /s

Swimsuits, like the rest of what we do to "protect" people from nudity, are completely pointless, and counterproductive. If you want to sexualize a pat of the body, make everyone cover it up under all circumstances. That's how you end up with people turned on by bare ankles.

So to answer the question, I think the nudists have it right. If we simply stopped caring about who sees what part of our body, the so-called "private parts" would very quickly lose their fascination, and all of body shame, sexualization of nudity, and all of the other damage caused to society by the prohibition of simple, non-sexual nudity would fade away almost immediately. In other words, we'd act like adults, even without our clothes on.

TL;DR - Swimsuits suck, nudity is only a big deal because we make it one, and the nudists have it right. 




 I guess if you can only see what the person you're spectating sees, that would be fine. No different than having someone else in the room.

I was just thinking that you could see anything, but what you propose is probably better. 




 Yeah, though a 1-2 minute delay is fine and solves the cheating problem. 




 Diablo is very weak early now, but once he hits mid/late game, I actually think he's a lot stronger now. His health pool is massive, like 8.4k, and the new ability at 20 is sweet.

Plus, I really like how he seems to have more viable talents now, as opposed to one really obvious talent at every level.

I like the new ETC, but I didn't play a lot of the old one, so I can't really speculate. I dislike that they've added another death-based ability, though. Speaking as a Tyrael main, I really hate those. 




 I wonder how republicans feel about this. 




 Thanks. 




 How does it work? Did you enable it through the Google app? 




 Doesn't matter. Being restricted to the free heroes is infinitely better than not being able to play at all. 




 Didn't care until I saw this:

When a regions game servers are undergoing maintenance, you may use the Global Play feature to log in to a different region that is not down for maintenance.

Now I care! Awesome! 




 I think it's more accurate to say that Anub was fixed, not buffed. The decreased casting delays are technically more of a buff, but I think the more significant change was that the beetles actually do what they're supposed to, now. 




 YEAH, THAT'S ILLIDAN'S JOB! 




 I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THIS GAME IS GOING TO LAUNCH WITH NO WAY TO UNBIND THE USELESS DISMOUNT BUTTON FROM THE BUTTON THAT DOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE! WHEN I PRESS Z I ALWAYS WANT TO GO FASTER, NEVER SLOWER!

REMOVE THE DISMOUNT BUTTON OR LET US BIND IT TO A DIFFERENT KEY! 




 That mini-gravbomb looks crazy powerful. 




 Thanks 




 What does "backtrain" mean? 




 "Nah." -- republicans 




 These are great and I can't wait for the specialists one! 




 Yup. She destroyed us single-handedly. 




 It's not live in the US yet? 




 Nope. NA. 




 It's gotta be a bug. She's surviving 1v4s. 




 The state shouldn't murder people. Especially innocent people.  




 Stupid things like "went to pot", " to boot", etc., that don't really make sense but people keep using them.  




  Bill Richards urged the jury to not pursue the death penalty.

If not for the victims, it makes you wonder who we're imposing the death penalty on behalf of.

And, of course, the answer is "pro life" republicans. 




 WHY IS THE DISMOUNT BUTTON STILL A THING! IT SERVES NO PURPOSE! REMOVE IT OR LET US MOVE IT TO SOMETHING THAT ISN'T ALSO THE MOUNT BUTTON!! 




 Brilliant! 




 Agreed. I wish they were in a more easily viewable location, as well. It can be unsafe to sneak a peak down at the corner of the screen in many situations, especially for those of us with large displays. 




 Definitely feeling the loss of the rockstar timer. 




 Armageddon and Deep Impact. 

In the summer of 1997, an asteroid threatens to end life as we know it. Can a specialized team plant a nuclear weapon below the surface of the killer rock before it's too late? And then can they do it again? 




 I know. I mean, maybe a Squirt machine... 




 I love it, too, though I'm still getting used to it. I still have moments where I'm like "C'mon, Stunned! Don't just stand there!" 




 There are dozens of us. Dozens! 




 Perhaps. I don't remember the exact circumstances, but I was pretty sure that she hadn't done anything like that. 




 Maybe. Haven't had any issues with latency lately, but perhaps. 




 Speaking on behalf of all of the Tyrael mains, please fix the trait before Sanctification. I know Sanctification isn't picked, but we're all stuck with Archangel's Wrath.

Judgement could also use some fixing, too. It often hits the wrong target, and the misfires at max range or when the target goes out of sight are incredibly frustrating. It's a fantastic ult, but missing a brief, but important, window to use it because it's so clumsy is really painful.

We know his win rate is high, and we don't disagree that he's a great warrior (and a total bad ass), but we could really use a few quality of life upgrades (and an actual trait) to make him a little smoother to play.

Thanks! 




 Actually they were about 20 minutes early with the last patch, I believe. 




 Fair enough. Thanks. 




  potentially his level 20 breath upgrade

You actually take that? The shield was incredibly powerful, and even if the new ability didn't look great (which it does), I'd take bolt over both of the ult upgrades.

I don't really think breath range or duration are all that useful, particularly the latter. Care to change my mind? 




  The new death metal seems terrible. ETC is really easy to keep alive. You typically have enough move speed, escapes and sustain to never die unless you want to. You essentially have to waste your level 20 talent to get an ability that makes you WANT to suicide. So not only are you now having to choose to kill yourself, but waste a talent getting that privilege. Also im assuming it will have the same wind up animation as normal mosh pit, AND you will [probably be a different ghost color, making it super obvious for people to GTFO, so most likely it will never hit anyone anyways.

As a Tyrael main, all I can say is be grateful that this is a talent, not your trait. 




 I don't know how powerful he'll be, but I really like this rework, because it seems like he has many more viable and fewer undeniable talents now. I can see making a decision at every level, instead of just picking "the right one".

One of my favorite things about playing Jaina is that I never build her the same way twice, and I can see this new Diablo potentially possessing that same level of viable variability. 




  The hope is that the release will eventually increase the pool of players to allow you to have an enjoyable casual 5 stack.

Don't see how. Anyone that wants to play already can. Not sure where this whole other population of players will come from.

I hope I'm wrong, because matchmaking is a nightmare right now. 




 Fantastic idea! 




 Glad of this, too. Hope to see this continuing in the future. Even earlier, preferably. Once the game is down for the patch, I don't see a  reason to delay publishing the patch notes. 




 I was really expecting a back-door Abathur. None in game. Well done! 




 There are two issues:

1. Tyrael will very often switch the target of judgement to another enemy (minions and mercs included). So you'll select Zeratul and it'll be ETC that gets hit with the primary effect.
2. Not technically a bug, but Tyrael will cancel judgement mid wind-up if the target goes out of range or sight. So you use the ability on a target in range, Tyrael stops moving, dismounts, shouts "embrace judgement!", and then does nothing. It's incredibly frustrating, and it makes the ability extremely difficult to use effectively at max range or near bushes. 




 I love the changes to Diablo. I can't say how it will affect how powerful he is, but now each level has several very compelling choices, rather than one obvious choice for 90% of the time. One of my favorite things about Jaina is that I build her differently each game, because almost all of her talents are viable, and I can definitely see this new Diablo being another hero like that.

Really super sad that Tyrael's trait and Judgement's bugs haven't been addressed, though. That's always the first thing I look for in each patch. 




 And is there a patent on the antidote? If there's nothing proprietary, what's stopping your competitor from making the same antidote and crushing you like the cockroach that you are?

Also, the police. 




 Agreed. I feel like it's possible for someone to be in a rank that isn't commensurate with their actual skill level, but I think that that's something that will self-correct over time. Until they can devise a way to realistically and accurately assess skill, I think that that's the best that you can really do. 




 I wonder about this, too. It seems pretty simple to me, especially because the matchmaking takes place before hero selection.

I think they try and match based on "skill", not rank, but frankly I don't think that there's really an effective way to programatically determine skill. Obviously Blizzard disagrees, but the result is not all that convincing. 




 WHAM! 




 Yup. True story. 




 Yeah, I definitely agree they shouldn't try and cram a hero into one of those roles for that, or any other, reason. 




  I'm more of the stance that they should design what works best for the character, without worrying about getting every category filled.

I can respect that, but we're really only talking about 2 more heroes. Not that they should make a character a warrior/support for this reason, but they should priorities a Starcraft support and a Dialo support. Push Fenix and Deckard, the monk, or some supporty angel (Auriel maybe) up in the pipeline and then it's done. 




 As much as I'd like her to be a support, I think there's almost no chance of it. She screams warrior. 




 Interesting how the legendary tint is the second one. 




 My bad. 




 Contact support. They'll help you pinpoint the issue.
