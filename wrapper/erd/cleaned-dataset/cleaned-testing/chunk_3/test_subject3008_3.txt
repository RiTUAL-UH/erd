 Agreed. They are a fashion statement around here (where I live. Not Reddit). People wear them around their necks. I assumed the design insinuated headphones, but apparently they are neck wear 




 No, BCGs take that honor. 




 Then my brother would walk around naked. no one wants they. Trust me. 




 My comment was a Scrubs reference. 




 Man is the only animal that wears pants during twosies. 




 I didn't think about that. Hmm... well good luck to anyone with that issue. 




 Thanks so much. I completely understand that. Worded perfectly 




 /r/milf 




 I do this too, though now it's just memory. I don't even think about it. 




 I've had trouble with this before. Why should I respect you just because you were born long enough before me? What's that have to do with respect? If idk you, fuck you. You have no claim to respect just because of your age. You could be a no respect deserving asshat and I should respect you because you've seen the 18-fucking hundreds? Fuck you. You might be a child diddler. I don't know. Fucking old people. 




 One other thing, how do we as humans know what animals see? How do we know certain animals can see x amount of colors more than we do? If a. We can't see these extra colors
b. We can't see through the animal's eyes
Then how do we know? Or how do we know which animals see in color and which see in black and white?
As far as I know, in reality, animals do not speak our language. Animals can't just say "I see in black and white" or "how many colors do your eyes acknowledge? Mine acknowledge x amount more. Lame human" It just baffles me.  




 I don't get total blindness. It might be due to the fact I was blessed with sight, but the idea of total blindness eludes me. The brain processes everything. What process replaces sight when one is blind. There must be something the brain "sees", ironically. Is it total darkness? The eyes must tell the brain something. There can't be no message from the eyes to the brain. It just doesn't make sense. The crazy thing is, I completely understand being completely deaf. Sound doesn't make it to the brain. What happens to visuals between the eye and the brain? Where does the image go? Does the brain just tell itself that everything is pitch black? 




 I have friends I've known for many years that have been music nerds since Jr. High school and some since elementary. They try to explain it every time I ask. After they finish, I remember why I don't ask. They explain it to me the same way they'd explain it to one another. Every time I'm like "Explain it like I'm slow because with this, I am." Still, they explain it like I know wtf is going on. 




 When I was very young I was taught that if you put your hands in front of you and make an "L" with each hand, the one that looks like the letter "L" on paper, that hand is your left. If the "L" you made looks like it's backward, it's your right hand. I hope this makes sense and helps.

Btw, your hands must be facing away from you so you see the backs of them. 




 I know the feeling. My dad has a great inner compass. Couldn't have passed it on genetically? Jerk! 




 We had those little bags of milk in school... I hated it. I'd end up poking the little straw all the way through and wind up with milk everywhere. I HATED it! 




 For a second, I didn't see the "nail" part and thought you found a whole finger. 




 I know a Brandy who loves pizza enough to eat it daily. Hell, I'm married to her... 




 Unless thou art the only one around. Or if it's chocolate milk. 




 My wife hated the movie because "it's nothing like the book". So I told her think of it as two separate entities. 




 Close but not Josh. More like John. 




 I love Jimmy eat world. That song does it for me too. If you know the background behind it, it's even more sad. 




 I don't see this one on here so: congratulations - blue October 




 Working on my car successful or not. Whether I appear frustrated or angry. I'm actually happy deep down. 




 For me, it's my beard.  




 I wish I read this comment before my last reply. My step mom and your dad would get along except she's difficult on the laundry too. 




 My step mom was like this. Pissed me off. 




 When I still lived at home, I was allowed to stay as long as I needed but my parents (dad and step mom) had to be able to view my bank account at any given time. This was not a problem since I don't buy much anyway. My problem was the confusion in this rule. My dad said "You shouldn't just go to work, come home, go to work come home and so on. Anyone who works should reward himself every payday with a little something. Even just a
cola on the way home from work." Which I did... then my step mom, within minutes of the purchase, would call my cell phone and bitch me out her : "What did you buy just now?" Me: "I stopped and got a soda for a dollar twenty five" her: " You're supposed to be saving so you can move out!" Me: "I suppose a dollar and a quarter will prevent that huh?" Her: "that's not the point, you need to save everything! You'll never make it on your own if you don't learn to manage your money!" Me: "so a dollar twenty five per week on myself is poor management? Hmm, then with that logic, I'm not as bad as you and dad right? Because a hundred dollars every other week going out to eat has to be worse financially" her: "Don't let it happen again!" Call ends. It was like having two different bosses. Ridiculous bullshit. 




 Oh, my God! I'm gagging and vomiting at the same time. I'm... I'm gavomiting! 




 Wow I thought my wife was the only one. She gets mad if I don't understand what she's talking about our if I'm confused. 




 My wife does this to me... when she pinches really hard, I react with an "ouch" or something similar and she gets mad telling me she didn't do anything.  




 If it's only meant to be viewed on internet exploder, then it's a waste of time. Also, the coder must not be aware of the fact that ie's last few users are mostly people's grandparents who will soon die. 




 My car battery had completely died and lucky enough for me, I had the cash to buy a new one. My car is a 2004 Chrysler Sebring 4 cylinder, 2.4l. With this particular car, you must get behind the wheel well of the front left (driver's side) tire to get to the battery. I got about half way through and it started pouring down rain. I couldn't leave everything as it was because my tire could get stolen or my newly paid for battery could get stolen. I'd be in some real problems then. Anyway, I couldn't get the tire to line up with the bolts so I could put the lug nuts on. I was getting frustrated. Cars and people passed by without even looking at the situation. Had it not been pouring rain, and about 30 degrees Fahrenheit, I would have been fine, but I was freezing and soaked. This guy finally stopped and told me to jack my car up some more (i thought it was already up as far as possible). After a few minutes of that, he had it all lined up and tightened the lug nuts so I was ready to go. Btw, I normally don't have trouble with this stuff, just cold rain makes it seem more complicated.

Tl;dr: I was putting my tire back on my car in pouring rain while it was 30 degrees out (Fahrenheit) and after an hour someone came and helped. 




 Yeah it feels weird and I feel if I say something it'll ruin the moment enough, she'll stop with the head. 




 What's pink and red and scratches at glass? 
A naked mole rat in a microwave.

What's pink and red and sits in a corner?
A naked mole rat chewing on razor blades sitting in a corner.

What stinks, is green, and sits in a corner?

The same mole rat two weeks later. 




 Either: 2 pounds of marijuana, 2 pounds of hundred dollar bills, or 220 pounds of myself for throwing away my life savings in money and all that weed.

Edit: flubber. 




 Dell computers. Fuck Dell computers.  




 Yeah and ie is the best browser and bing should be your search engine... 




 I use MSE (Microsoft security essentials), it came with my computer. It does okay but only with full scans. If I do a quick scan, it doesn't find anything. I use the paid version of MBAM  (malware bytes anti malware). Mbam detects lots of stuff that mse detect. Mse find things mbam misses and vice versa. They work great together. No conflicts or anything. 




 I have ccleaner and use it weekly but I never ever ever ever use the registry cleaner. Fuck that. I only mess with registry keys individually. Ccleaner can clean temporary files only. On my computer at least. 




 I keep a usb drive with chrome install file handy. So it's actually so simple. 




 I remember him.  




 Seriously, a program called scorpion saver. Anything related to it. It'll interrupt plenty of important tasks and processes. I was updating a beta version of a game and it was constantly getting stuck at 30% and I uninstalled scorpion saver completely and the update worked. 




 My Wife's grandma's computer looks like this. Makes me cringe. 




 Falcon nw is awesome. Expensive, but worth it. The only pc I've ever owned that I didn't build was a Mach V from falcon. Still have it. 




 I hate Dell. Eww. I'd fall off the internet if Dell was my only choice. Also, I second the build your own pc thing. I've always owned personally built PCs 




 Trojans 




 My brother hates this too. My dad would purposely rub his hands/feet on the carpet to bug my brother. 




 Even worse for me is anything sticky. If I get seated at a restaurant and the table is sticky... no no no no. There is this dive bar here called "Hey Joe's", the tables are covered in news paper and magazine articles and sealed with a clear coat. Idk what happened, but someone fucked up, the clear coat is sticky. It's dry, but feels sticky, I refuse to eat there. 




 Fudge pops bother me more than popsicles. 




 I've never told anyone this but bare mattresses feel weird to me. Makes me cringe just thinking of the texture. 




 I didn't see this one but: The Purge. 




 It's like wiping peanut butter from a shag carpet. It's never truly gone. So I use wet wipes after tp. 




 I love them all. Anytime I go, they're having this deal where I think you buy five get one free or something. I usually do this twice and add 4 chocolate chip cookies for 25c each. I end up sick to the stomach pigging out. Worth it! They have this almond crunch one, little bitty almond pieces on a soft chewy cookie... heaven.
