 I really don't get all the commotion why people point out that Asians like taking pics of their food.  It's been a fad for awhile.  Now [this](http://www.instant-ramen.net/2009/05/how-asians-take-pictures/) on the other hand, is getting more buzz

 I got approached by this woman last weekend with my friend in midtown.  She came up from behind, rubbed my back and asked if we were working for some no name company.  She totally reeked of booze.  When I told her to fuck off, she walked away and essentially did the same thing in the video (stopping cars, flipping off people)   




 What's remarkable about him, is how passionate he takes his job.  Not saying that making sushi is mundane, but after doing it for over 50 years, he still takes his trade so seriously.  I think it's safe to say most of us get tired/bored of our jobs after awhile, especially if it's not challenging, or the pay is low.  This man gives his life to it.  Props

 You need a good skirt steak, marinated in lime juice, salt, garlic, pepper, onion, cumin, chilli powder, touch of olive oil tenderize it.  Grill it, or broil.

I'd go with canned black beans, im sure you can find a easy recipe for rice.  Get some cilantro, tomato, onion.  Cojita cheese.  Roll the bad boy up.  




 Same feeling.  I'd say he's entertaining

 Thanks.  It's interesting getting peoples philosophies on FF.  Some say QB simply because he has the ball in his hands and makes the plays.  Others argue there's only a handful of elite WR's so you gotta get em fast.   




 Given Reddit's stance on cops, your answer is rare.  I raised that question because in other related threads, everyone is here bashing the cops left n right.   




 So the next question..Are you willing to pay taxes in order for police to get more efficient training?  On the importance scale from 1-10, and with budget restraints, where does this rank?   




 Groin stretches in a cageful of hungry tigers.  In all honesty, one of the worst ways to die would be to die with regret, and sorrow.  To realize you didn't live to the potential, and that you wasted your life and cannot take it back.

 I take things personally. I remind myself, it's never an attack on me, or that people are deliberately out to get me, but when I get upset that's usually the basis.   




 Return fire has no bearing on this matter.  He pointed a fucking gun in one of the busiest streets in the world.  Shit is gonna go down.  

As for the bystanders, how fast can you process and react to what was happening around you?  Unless you grew up in a war torn country I.e Iraq, no way you would ever imagine a gun fight during morning commute.  Youre gonna run frantically, every which way possible.  Even towards the chaos.  




 Here come the Monday morning quarterback comments.  Look, you can sit here and analyze the video and say "the academy teaches you this and that," but at the end the officer put himself in the line of fire.  
Im not siding with the cops, but it's real easy from our vantage point to criticize the way it was handled, incompetent or not.  Most cops never have use their firearm in their lifetime, esp nypd.   




 This site has a bunch of Batsu Games dating all the way back to the late 80's.  The most recent one is [amazing](http://gakifiles.blogspot.com/p/2012-airport-batsu-game-subtitle.html) 




 Should be fine, you're using some strong spices that beer won't alter the flavor.  Maybe add a touch of beef stock or water, but I wouldn't stress on it.  Post pics and let us know how it turned out.   




 You're claiming it's a myth, I'm arguing there is actual fact.  Grades might not be distinguished the same as beef (prime, choice, etc) but fresh fish that I was eating daily in Japan+NYC was "sashimi grade" compared to the places you've worked i.e (farm rasied)  Dunno where you live, but in NYC where I work and live, sashimi is flown in from Japan+Australia daily.  

I agree places like Whole Foods will get away with their "sashimi" but scientific fact, when the brain of the fish is pierced and lactic acid is minimal, you're getting the best of the best.  I know that's what I'm getting.   




 How is it myth?  [fact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sashimi)

 Uhh, NYC has been under surveillance for years.  You can call it Big Brother, or whatever, since 9/11 the technology in this city is unparallel.   




 PMT is great.  I was intimidated by BDC student's and atmosphere.  I'm not bad, used to break for years but when I was at BDC, you can see/feel this sense of students always sizing you up.   




 Mexican officer, late 30's.  His partner was young 20 yr fresh out of the academy. Dude was so stoked to bust me.  I'm asian, in my 30's but young looking.  He didn't seem upset really, and I did not sound off at him.  It was a busy Friday night, streets were packed and people walking around.  Maybe it was the energy.  I do remember the commanding officer showed up in a unmarked car.  He asked the arresting officer, "do want to go ahead and process?"  Almost had my hopes up for second.  




 No fines.  Technically my case is sealed shut, but can re open if I do something stupid again.  As much as NYC is strict and cops are asses,it is one of the few states that is liberal for 1st time offenders of weed.  The ACD law has been around since the 70's.  I haven't done a background search on myself yet, but from what I've read the ACD is sealed from any outside sources.   




 Busted last summer on the corner of Bleeker and Bowery.  3 of us were passing a joint around on the street, cop car pulled up and arrested us on the spot.  

The time frame last about 3 1/2 hours from beginning to end.  After getting printed, processed, and what seemed like an eternity, we were let go.  My court date was 2 months later.  That lasted 15 min tops, judge gave me a A.C.D (Adjournment for Court Dismissal). End of story.  

 




 Oh nice, i keep hearing how the Whitney and the new museum are worth checking out  




 Same here!  I went there at 345, all their soups were gone.  Maybe it's a summer thing  




 Thanks for giving the heads up on this.  I was planning on getting stoned and checking out the exhibit.  




 Soup spot on west 31, 18 different hand made soups a day.  Lobster bisque is amazing there 




 Even if you're loaded on Vicodin, no way in hell you go on a killing rampage.  If you're on Oxy then you're even less inclined bc you'll be so subdued.  He might have been on anti-depressants, or some psycho tropic drug, but not pain meds.   




 They sweated him because he checked "yes" on whether he was arrested or not.  Plus he's famous.  Normal folks with a record can still get thru no problem.  When they scan your passport your personal history doesn't show up.  No such thing as private security companies, airports are government related in japan.  You are right about xenophobic 




 He only got caught bc he's famous, and he probably checked "yes" for have you ever been arrested.  I've got a record, and each time in customs I've gone thru no problem.  When your passport is scanned your criminal history doesn't show up unless for a serious offense i.e murder, drugs.  There's no way databases are linked globally at airports.   




 There's a woman on the corner of W 32nd and 7th ave, (next to Nathan's) that has a pillow stuffed under her stomach and begs for money all day.  It's upsetting because people actually fall for it.   




 You didn't answer the 2nd question.  If the higher ups failed to take any action, and Ramos was still out there doing his thing, what would you do?  How far do you go to see him get reprimanded?  Do you risk your own job?   

It's hypothetical, but let's be real.  There's a general code amongst the blue boys.  My point is, there's Ramos everywhere doing illegal shit 24-7.  How much of it is tolerated is a question unanswered, but from an outsider, I wonder who would stand up and intervene.   




 Curious question.  Let's say you knew this guy Ramos, and what he was doing.  Would you turn him in?  One step further, let's say you do report him and no action was taken.  What lengths would you take to see him reprimanded?   




 Japanese guy here.  I must eat everything with rice.  And yes, KFC and rice is the bomb.  Can't forget that gravy either

 sorry my dude, i got a few buddies named chad as well.  they all laugh it off 




 I was fortunate to go to private school bc my parents (japanese) believed in good education.  About 90% of my classmates were white, (wealthy white) while the other 10% were asian+black.  I was able to attend bc of finanical aid.  At a early age I saw firsthand just how different a mindset these kids had vs the minorities.  It was self entitlement and this general attitude of being spoiled and saying/doing outrageous shit thinking it's completely acceptable. 


The one thing I still get annoyed with is when I deal with entitled rich white punks who think they run the shit.  It's a certain arrogance and mindset that exists.  Now that I'm living in NYC I see it 24-7 especially around midtown.  My friends and I like to call them Chad's + Brad's and or Wall St Douchebags.   




 Kinda didn't want to highjack this thread, but yeah block curry is uber artificial.   




 Yup the best.  I overheard some locals joking that Dom won't even let his daughters grate the cheese, and they've been working there for years.

 Good question.  When I have people over, I use a burner stove so that I can cook on the table, but you can also do it over stove top.  Not a rolling boil, but a good simmer.  The key is getting the beef cut super thin (paper thin 1/16").   You basically want to dip the meat and swirl in the water for a few seconds max.  Veggies will take longer.   




 Japanese style foundue minus the cheese.  Thin sliced meats and veggies get cooked quickly in a broth, and dip with sauces.   




 I used to work for a home health care agency, part of the job was to deliver meds to people with chronic illness.  One client was a 17 year old with severe arthritis which prompted him to be dependent on pain killers.  Month by month I noticed his orders of opiates began to increase not only in quantity but strength.  He began to lose weight fast, and his skin color was pale from being indoors.  It got so bad  there would be times I would go over to his house and while we were talking he would doze off in mid sentence.

One day during my delivery, I pulled him aside and told him my concern.  Of course this could have totally gotten me fired bc it really wasn't any of my business, but I felt the need to say something.  It was a short stern talk, and really didn't expect much from it.  

A year later, and I moved to NY and I get a friend request from him on Facebook.  My eyes began to water as I looked thru his pictures.  Not only did he move out of his home, he got a job working IT, became super fit and tanned.  He thanked me the talk because no one else (not even mom) gave a shit.   




 That's bc it's mostly korean exchange students around that area.  (language schools)  Next time when you're inside, take a look around and see the average age.  Personally I love woorijip bc of their selection.     




 Katsuhama FTW.  Most japanese don't like go go  




 I always thought the murder of MJ's dad was tied into his gambling.    




 Von bar, bleeker and Bowery.  Walk in past the bar, make a right and there's a secret bar downstairs with a dance floor  




 Yeah I've been on C.L the last few days, I feel like the window for stolen goods is prob 48 hours tops before it gets flipped.   




 I just wanted to see the process from beginning to end of what exactly takes place.  I'd rather hear a cop be straight up and tell me "look, there's not much we can do." Giving me #'s to call, waiting for detectives is just wasting time.   




 Backstory:  Last nite I left the front window open in my living room, woke up in the morning to find the screen window busted open and 2 of my wife's lap tops missing.  The laptops were sitting on the couch.  It was a pretty brave move on the burglars part, only because he would have had to actually open a gate, peak in from a ledge, and then break the screen.  Either way, it was a shitty feeling, and we should have known better.  


So we decide to call the cops, 4 huge dudes (more like gorillas) came in did some paper work, told us a detective would come by to do some prints.  They told us not to touch a thing because its all evidence, blah blah, and handed us a "incident information slip".  They gave us a # to call to report this matter in order to receive a complaint report #.  We've tried calling this number all day yesterday and today, no answer.   


I'm in no way expecting to find my laptop, I know its a lost cause.  But is this really the case where cops come in, give you a slip of paper and act like they're working only to have you run in circles?  Why couldn't they issue a Report # on the spot so a file could be started?  Anyone else have similar incidents?    




 As a native SF, we've been calling it the city for decades.  Even our hoops team has a [sweatshirt](http://kazowie.com/wespreston/B-Day+%6010/Golden+State+Warriors+The+City+Pullover+Hoodie) 




 Even soda tasted better at the Japanese McD.  Better quality sugar, or cane.  




 I'm surprised your black buddies spider senses didn't tingle up and tell you to not even step foot inside the bar.  I know my friends would immediately say something. Sorry this happened 




 It was our first date, we were dancing at a concert in Prospect Park.  All night long we just grooved out, and at the end of the night a club promoter handed a flyer and told us to come to his party because he liked our dancing.  

When I told him this was our first date, he said "you guys look like you've been together for awhile!"  I kinda already had the feeling she was "the one", but the club promoter sealed the deal.
