 That is part of our research but our project requires we get opinions from different cultures and peers regardless of their knowledge,  we do not necessarily need to consider it a reliable source, we just need to show evidence of a spectrum of opinions. 




 What is your perspective on whether or not the U.S Foreign Aid towards the Syrian refugees has been sufficient? (Opinions on Obama and Syrian Refugees) 

For a school project (iGCSE GP), I need to get a range of opinions.-so I thought Reddit would be a good place to come to. What are your opinions on how The US and/or other countries have handled the issue and Syria and how they have/should have dealt with the issue of refugees? Also feel free to add any information on the topic too. If you don't mind, I would appreciate of you stated your culture/home country since I need to show I have opinions from a variety of backgrounds. Thank you so much :)

 Im 80% sure I'm gonna be watching the world cup next year! :) 




 You should've deleted everything dude. And boy am I glad I didn't comment on the last two posts. Call the police is all I have to say. Good luck OP. 




 UPDATE:

OK guys. I checked out La Senza today and they didn't sell anything above D but a 32D seemed like a good fit. I'm guessing 32E will be perfect so thank you to anyone who suggested I try that size instead! :)
