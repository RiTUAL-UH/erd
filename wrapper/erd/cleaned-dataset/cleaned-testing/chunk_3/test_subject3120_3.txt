 My 8 year old account was banned last year. 




 OP what nationality is she?  Curious because of the shape of her nose.  




 the problem with gfycat.com is it's not mobile-friendly, in other words, if you access reddit from your mobile, you can't load these images

the best gif viewer on mobile so far that works best with reddit is imgur

 




 It seems you're a fucking cunt.  Or maybe you're just a troll 









 MA has had this requirement for a long time

 Awesome lineup 




 You mean UMass, right OP?  Not Amherst College 




 The dude drives a car, eats at McDonald's, drinks Starbucks coffee (at $4 a pop), has an iPhone and pays for cable.

Choices, man.  It's not about your wages, it's about what you spend your money on. 




 It depends on where you live.  You can often get all of that included if you live in Sunderland or Belchertown.  Apartments in Amherst and Northampton are much much more expensive and utilities are often NOT included 




 Here's mine about the Jewish student that was caught painting swastikas on her own door

 Do you have a different link?  We can't download from Mega in our area (blocked by the ISP) 




 previously known as Cold Spring and Belcher's Town, named after Jon Belcher, the royal governor of Mass 




 yeah can't find much in the video database for her yet... 




 ooooo InfoLiars.com!  so it must be true! 














 My wife and I own a house and some land in Amherst, MA.  We've lived here since the 1960s.  We love it.  It's racially diverse (I'm white an my wife is Korean), a great place to have a family and grow up (my kids stayed in Amherst and they have their own kids now).

I'm 63, I'll retire in a couple years.  My wife and I have talked about moving to someplace warmer because it's so frikking cold here in the winter.  This last winter was especially bad.  But all of our family are here and it would be a burden to them for us to move away, so I think we'll stay.  Besides, we have a huge house and lots of land.  My wife is an avid organic gardener and we have fruit trees, berry bushes and several gardens.  I'd hate to give that up.

I can't speak about small business ownership.  I work at a couple of the local hospitals which have their issues in management, but overall are excellent.

Like I said, I've owned property in Amherst since it was cheap.  It's very expensive now, but you can find more affordable real estate in Belchertown, which is not too far from here, or South Hadley which is a bit farther, but also a very nice place to live (my youngest daughter lives there with her girlfriend - yes it's gay friendly).

Hope it helps 




 OP do you have a link to the original movie?

 Agreed.  Mike Marshall is as talented as Thile, but much more versatile, and his experience (and age) give him more breadth.  I vote for Marshall. 




 Mike Marshall 









 Wow why do you tolerate these returns?  Can't they afford to spend the money? 




 Ah...I see this is from InfoLiars.com  no reliable references, as per usual 




 not top stories...I use an RSS reader called "inoreader" which can display the articles or just the headlines. 




 are you talking about DARPA's Memex project? 




 I read news headlines from a dozen sources including /r/news (yeah I know, right?) and trust nothing.

I like a lot of what [James Corbett](http://reddit.com/r/CorbettReport) has to say, but of course he's not "news".  I read my local papers online "breaking news" pages, and have the [Breaking News](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.breakingnews) app on my android.

For lels, I like [GLP](http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/pg1) and [/pol/](https://boards.4chan.org/pol/)

 Why does it matter?  He had nothing to do with 9/11.  He was a CIA asset.  He was used for almost a decade as a boogey man to scare the American public into the Patriot Act and a bunch of other nonsense.

 Did this with a $1500 snow blower last xmas.  Still have the blower, and my credit! 




 Good idea for a business: skate-board proof shoes 




 I'll be 64 in July.  I've traveled all over the world as a doc with Mdecins Sans Frontires, the last 7 years working as an ER doc in my home town.  I'm married to a very beautiful Korean lady (this is our 30th year!), we have 4 children and 9 grandchildren.  For fun I play music with friends, go hiking and spend time with our family.  Life is good. 




 Remember back when they were having problems recruiting soldiers for the Iraq war?  They lowered the bar and started accepting criminals and felons, people who were unstable or had mental issues... 




 I'll be 64 in July, hardly your son.

 So were mine.  Mine were slaves, actually.  They were forced here by their owners.

Yes, you should assume that. 




 You've never worked in food service, I take it? 




 Keep your hand off the instrument.  Relax your wrist.  Angle the pick to the side (not the point).  Start slowly and work up to a fast tempo over time using a metronome - quarter notes, 8th notes, 16th notes, 32nd notes, etc. 




 But if you've ever worked in food service, you know there is sexual harassment.  Wherever there are immigrants that don't speak English, you'll find it. 














 totally photoshopped but loveable anyway 




 I took HTML and Microsoft Office there in the 1980s.  It was pretty good then.  I know a lot of the people that work there now.  It's quite respectable.  A few UMass Amherst professors also teach there.

Not sure about the music department, however. 









 this is not gonewild, go get your rocks off somewhere else 




 she's not busty, she's fat 




 nice body, but I don't like hangers 




 Wrinkly neck and shoulders area indicates:

a) age - you're over 40

b) recent weight loss

c) too much sun 




 ugh wrinkly neck.  did you recently lose a lot of weight or are you just old?   




 I hope the GOP and AIPAC supporters see this video.  Maybe once they understand that they are hated in Israel, they won't want to send my tax dollars there any more 









 Hardly crazy.  Chinese people have a different idea of what's important in life than Americans.  That's really all there is to it. 














 That was a little harsh. Why do I sense anger?

So you think morality is subjective and relative and that is why you acquiesce to the idea that systems of governance must aggress? Its a necessary evil for the greater good? And you really can't imagine another way? Is that your general position?  














 I don't have any apple products and never will.  I'm not registering for iTunes just to use this service. 









 But you have to have one of either service, which I have neither. 




 Wow do you have a pic of it now?  That would be cool to juxtapose them together 





























 Something like guitar hero, but with a full band instead of one instrument, and not a contest, but a jam session.  It would be an online game where you could play music with people from all over the world.

You could pick your instrument and by practicing it, become more efficient and get invited to join better groups - like bands or orchestras or whatever.

 




 Must be an old picture because CA doesn't have any water now 



















 I like to make people healthy (I'm an ER doc) and in the evenings, I like to make music with my family and friends.

Thanks for the explanation.  I still don't get how it works.  I understand the point of it 




 They are working on that new warning system 




 She's got a beautiful body.  Too bad her face is kind of bland

 I don't mind a few rules as long as they are reasonable, but lately the rules have seemed so arbitrary and not consistently enforced 









 F is cosmetics.  Tim O'Brien plays an A and always has.

Besides, you can't get a good F for under $500.  I promise.

Try a Kentucky A140.  I played one for a decade in the 80s and still have it on my wall for the grandkids to noodle on 




 Was she a heroin user?

 What was the fucking point of that lame-ass "video"?  Why couldn't you just write a fucking blog post with that info instead of wasting my time with that annoying fucking music which just freaked out my dogs? 














 Pretty sure they are not photoshopped off.

The landscape looks asian...maybe Vietnam? 









 the boobs are photoshopped as you can see from the shadowing and distortion around the arms 














 1.  Get a good mandolin teacher

2.  Make sure he/she is a mandolin player, not a guitarist that can "pick a few tunes" - you want someone that plays and teaches mandolin

3.  Learn to read music.  Sure you can learn tab too, but if you're going to play with others, music is the best form to use

4.  Find a teacher that also leads a good mandolin group so you can learn to play the instrument, and play in a group setting 




 She's had extensive cosmetic surgeries

 That's Grover Norquist.  He was 2 grades below my eldest son growing up in the Boston area.  He was a douche then too.  Nobody liked him, as I recall. 




 It has the #2 food service in the US 




 This nonsense is happening here on /r/conspiracy now!  Just had a mod tell me something I posted violated "rule 5" (no stalking or trolling).  I've been a member of this sub for a couple of years.  Hardly stalking or trolling here 




 Seriously?   









 Don't need to hire a PI to find out where the kid is.  Go to "Plenty of Fish" do a search for anyone in Dalian, China.  Offer them $100 to find these Americans (I guarantee they are well known there).  Book a flight to Dalian (14 hours from JFK), kidnap the kid.  Fly home. 




 Nice try, Chinese Government!
