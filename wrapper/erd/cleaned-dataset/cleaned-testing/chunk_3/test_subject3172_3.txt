 It depends. For instance, my hometown had its sewage treatment plant in the south part of town, and it stank to high heaven because nobody cared enough about odor abatement. When they switched to district representation, and the city commission had a rep from that part of town for the first time, it got cleaned up fairly quickly.

District representation makes some things better and some things worse. We'll have to see how the balance shakes out here. 




 Isn't that covered under step 4? 




 Do you have any duck food? 




 Thanks. 




 I didn't see that AMA. I'm not terribly surprised.  




 OC is correct that Phelps did a lot of worthy civil-rights work, and in his home town, Topeka KS, where I used to work, he had a lot of friends and loyalty among black leaders even after he went full-on evil. 




 Thanks, I hadn't thought of that. 




 Thanks! I'll give it a look. 




 Hi folks. I'm a grad student working on a project that involves downloading posts and comments from a couple of Reddit subs, and I'm a complete noob at Python and so on. I'm trying to self-teach, but it's slow going, and I need a boost.

So if anyone in Austin can meet me and show me how to do the stuff I need to do (or explain that it can't be done, though I'm confident it can) in PRAW and how to manage the output so it's in a form I can use, I'd be happy to pay for a lesson or two.

(My project isn't "about" scraping Reddit data, my adviser doesn't care how I get the stuff off the site, so this isn't a "do my homework for me" request.)

Thanks! 




 You left out "There are those who will say that" before that quote; the author is arguing *against* the sentiment you attribute to her. 




 I made my GF watch this one, because she had lost my car.

Kind of a long story, but I went out of town for a couple of weeks, and her car needed repairs so she used mine while it was in the shop, and when her car was ready she drove my car downtown to pick it up, intending to come back on the bus later to get my car, only she just plumb forgot, and didn't remember till days later. By that time it had been towed from the 2-hour lot, of course. She was appropriately apologetic and paid the fines, so no harm done. 

In fact she enjoyed the movie, unexpectedly considering what a guy flick it is, and so did I. Though our fun was probably enhanced by the absurdity of the previous events. 




 I only went to that movie because they had a free showing as part of a radio promotion, but I liked it anyway. 




 The critics basically all have to see it, but the audiences are self-selected; they only go to a movie if they're confident it's their kind of thing. So more than half of moviegoers in general might think it's a bad movie, but they won't rate it online because they went to something else instead.

 You should read more closely. Leaving early would have cost *more*, presumably because of the penalty for changing the flight. In that situation, the way you cut your losses is you try to make something of it. Which he did. And things didn't improve. 




 "You just made my whole day." 




 You have no idea what attitude he went into SXSW with. It didn't help that the festival made it harder to preview the bands before showing up this year, but if he thought it was going to suck he'd have stayed home. He's that kind of guy. 




 He's written about the process in past years and has gotten a lot more out of it. 10 days working full time (because this is his job) should be plenty to find the interesting bands, and this year everyone was from LA instead all over. Now that the festival depends so heavily on corporate sponsors, they bring in more bands the corporations already like and fewer unknowns. It doesn't matter if ~2200 bands are in town if they're all the same thing. 




 I think it's important to have it during spring break, so the students who want to attend or volunteer can do so, and the ones who want to get out of town and avoid the madness can do that. But you're right that it's gotten too big and out of control (and money-hungry). 



















 People in your actual life are like this, it just hasn't happened in front of you yet.

 I saw one a few years ago on the Shoal Creek trail in Austin that paused for a second as it skittered across the path. Not easy to spot; it blended in pretty well. 




 What my last GF called "manly stench." 




 Looks as if the city considers Uber a limousine service, not a taxi service, since taxi services have tons of hoops to jump through that Uber likely hasn't dealt with. Per [this link](http://www.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/Texas/austin/title13transportationservices/chapter13-2groundtransportationpassenger?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:austin_tx$anc=JD_13-2-191) via /u/glassuser below, limo services have to have a minimum $55 fare and 30-minute advance booking.

 You know what they say: If you run into an asshole, he's an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole. 




 Most of the bands here for the music portion only get to play one official set, but they're here to get noticed, so there's a secondary economy of bands playing gigs all over town at unofficial venues, including a lot that don't have live music otherwise. Just wander around central Austin and you'll hear a lot of them.

Several years ago I lived at the north end of West Campus and just walking up the street in the afternoon I could generally catch four or five bands. 




  My wife and I used to love going there and we always spent money. But the store started to change and going there stopped being fun.

Yeah, this. I moved nearby in 2007 and loved the place, but sometime around 2010 it was noticeably going downhill, and by the last time I was in there last year it was basically all Hello Kitty merchandise. It seemed like a bizarre trajectory. 




 I know all the letters, or at least 26 of them. Are there more? 




 The what now? 




 Toy Joy was already a shell of its former self before it moved. Last time I went in there it had basically turned into a Hello Kitty store; a lot of the cool stuff I went in there for was long gone. 

It may have been inevitable, I don't know what was going on behind the scenes, but it had gradually been losing its mojo for some time. 




 You missed the part that most of that 2.5 hours isn't part of the calculation. The report doesn't care if you're driving in from Georgetown or Amarillo, only the stretches where traffic is consistently slower than it should be -- the roads in Austin metro -- are part of the calculation.  




 Not quite. They only count the congested parts of roads. The congestion index only accounts for the parts of roads between Waco and Austin that are actually slowed down by traffic. In the NYC area (and other big metros) there are longer stretches of slowed-down roads. 

If you're happy with a short but slow commute, then you're happy because you live close to work, not because traffic is light. Because it isn't. 




 Um, because the library doesn't open until 7? 




 As I understand it, Austin wastes more time per mile of road. NYC's commutes cover longer distances. 




 The [methodology section](http://scorecard.inrix.com/scorecard/methodology.asp) says, if I'm reading it right, that they take the road lengths into account -- that is, NYC drivers sit in traffic longer, but that's partly because they drive farther on average. So, say, a theoretical 10-minute drive that takes 30 minutes is more congested than a 20-minute drive that takes 50 minutes, by that measure. Again, if I'm reading it right. 




 Politics, especially in Texas, is a full-contact sport. It ain't the garden club election. 




 That's not money from the university itself. It's money given by employees and their families out of their own pockets. When you donate to a candidate or a party organization you have to say where you work. 









 Such a little devil, that one. 




 Agree about Sprint. I love the unlimited-data plan, but lordy their coverage here sucks. 




 Suddenly everyone was dog tired. 




 Me: "Know what?"

Dad: "No, what?"

It seemed quite clever to my young self. 




 Interesting. There are lots of other factors too, such as that people will walk farther to get to faster transit, e.g. rail. 




 People generally will only walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop. Guad to Congress is about a quarter-mile. That means that if someone wants to get somewhere east of Congress, they may decide the added distance is not worth the effort. 

Having the buses on Congress puts them closer to things people actually take the bus to get to. This will speed up traffic going *through* downtown, but trips going *to* downtown are another matter. 




 Not really a neighborhood intersection; it's a five-way with a lot of traffic, and discouraging cyclists from blowing through there is probably a worthwhile exercise. 




 Little Deli is a wonderful place, glad to see it's getting its due. 




 You're the one complaining that they dress ugly and using hostile language. Go take a chill pill. 




 [Relevant book.](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465022219/) [Excerpt.](http://www.instapaper.com/text?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.salon.com%2Fchromeo%2Farticle%2Fyoure_making_your_depression_worse_self_help_is_bringing_us_down%2F) (Instapapered because Salon's two-column Web layout renders it unreadable.) tl;dr: It's not as easy as just not thinking about depression, but our feelings *about* our feelings are a big part of the problem. 




 Just keep telling yourself that if they had a choice they would dress to please you, if it makes you feel better.
