 It is so badly written with spelling mistakes, I think it is just someone's blog with a view on the satellite industry rather than trying to be anything.    




 The article/comment....  (It isn't that sort of website where traffic matters as there are no adverts)

----------------------------


So, the SpaceX hype turned out to be just that. An altogether more prosaic investment was announced to fund core operations.


SpaceX, currently embroiled in a court case with its benefactor the US government which elected to give SpaceX no part of a recent $11bn launch order (http://spacenews.com/42882filing-suggests-jurisdictional-challenge-in-spacex-lawsuit-against-us ) and on the heels of a recently crashed launch, needed cash. This investment is about funding its core operations, not about initiating some fantasy global satellite constellation about which no mention is made.


Google (who made no comment) are named alongside Fidelity as investors, but no amount is given. So, it could be the Google Charitable Foundation, and it could be $1 for all we know. Fidelity invests for a living.


Also, in typically cryptic fashion, no terms are mentioned. Ordinary shares, convertible loans, preference shares, exploding warrants, covenants and targets ?


The uninformative Spacex website merely has the text below, making it clear that proceeds are to fund continued innovation in the areas of space transport, reusability, and satellite manufacturing i.e. the core business was running out of money, and no mention of fleets of satellites.


Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) has raised a billion dollars in a financing round with two new investors, Google and Fidelity. They join existing investors Founders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Valor Equity Partners and Capricorn. Google and Fidelity will collectively own just under 10% of the company.


SpaceX designs, manufactures, and launches the worlds most advanced rockets and spacecraft. This funding will be used to support continued innovation in the areas of space transport, reusability, and satellite manufacturing.


Incredibly, newspspers of record like The Times reported last night the rumours, not the facts SpaceX is a private company and thus is subject to no stock market rules about truthful or complete press releases. Google made no announcement, suggesting nothing material has happened
 




 it is terribly written.  However, it makes me think how much we really know and how much of it is a long term vision 




 Honestly, i would be interested. I picked it of an investment board regarding geostationary satellites.  So don't know how much of it is investors in denial. 












































 I do not think it is any better in other countries either

 Yes, I also hear there are actual cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim where non-Muslims just simply dont go in.

And, parts of London, there are actually Muslim religious police that actually beat and actually wound seriously anyone who doesnt dress according to religious Muslim attire.

 What is a ring fixer called?  Job title? 




 People who harass/make fun of/make the job harder for janitorial workers. Seriously, its one of the most honest and hard working jobs you can have. Another person is literally cleaning up your shit so you can have a decent place, to dump more of your shit.
If you make fun of a janitor for doing what they do, youre clearly a pretty sad and pathetic person. Way lower than the hard working person youre making fun of.

 The [OP is a also a repost](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/13viu7/good_guy_ceo_of_costco/).  Nice job all round.  

 All hail Costco 

update...  Oh shit you are [stalking me and pointing out reposts for cheap karma.](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2smz9i/remember_that_undeletable_super_cookie_verizon/cnr7j8e)   Meta is so boring.   Lets talk about costco! 




 Something like this would work for me

 Costco again proves that you can treat employees well and pay them a fair wage while remaining competitive.  

Look into the history of costco management. They have very consistently and firmly stood by their employees.
A few years ago they were ridiculed by their investors for basically treating their employees too well (too much pay, too many benefits, etc). The CEO basically told the investors that they were welcomed to sell off their stock if they have a problem with it, but that the company has consistently been a good investment because of the decisions they make to stand by their employees and that he has no intention of changing that.

I have a lot of admiration for costco as a company.  All hail Costco ~ company of common sense and eminent reign.

 What are you talking about?  This is not a repost.  







































 Comments like this make scrolling through all the forced memes, low effort karma whoring, pun threads, and other cancer worthwhile. 




 All the talk of mass surveillance is very dangerous if it doesn't come with some hope of a solution because it grants more perceptual power to a system that already has a radical, extreme and destabalising amount of it. All that is necessary to control others is the projected perception of power. That's why we have worked hard to break that perception, for example in the race to spirit Edward Snowden to asylum vs. Washington DC's race to arrest him, we won, demonstrating that with a few good ideas and some determination it is possible to beat this power cluster in a well defined head on contest.Solutions are going to come form the demand that organisations, governments and individuals have for protection. Don't be dispirited; a lot of people are now working rapidly on tools and standards to counter the mass surveillance attack. There's a great flowering in that field. 




 It's frustrating, the internet has become such a creepy "you are the product" medium. The more of this I see, I start to feel like I don't want to be a part of it anymore. 




 This should be top comment.   The fundamental problem is the regulator and corporate influence on government.  We need a change that we can believe in. 




 I remember the first time I called a congress person (it was SOPA - I'd never done it before) and I was so nervous. The person who picked up was really nice, maybe a little bored even, and seemed genuinely happy to hear from someone who cared about their country.
Pretend you're calling up a friend and you're telling them how you feel about this thing you care about.
 




 Does anyone else think Elon Musk was sent back from the future to save humanity from itself? I mean his name is kind of a give away. 




 I thought you were the one collected cheap karma by adding 'meta' comments about reposts.  I will reflect on my actions but believe I have contributed to this discussion. 




 My grandpa is brainwashed by Fox news. 




 I want to have a discussion.  Some of us understood what that move was about... These attacks in France will also be aiding the push/  It's sad when politics and terrorism seem to have a shared agenda.  Politics has very much become Terrorism, in and of itself. They literally try to terrify us into flocking behind them for protection every chance they get. 




 My original was  an inciteful comment and should have been the top comment here.  I have given it a 2nd chance because I want people take it at face value and not be distracted by the repost police... yet here you are.      




 That's nice.

But means nothing until we see something result from this. 




 In case you were wondering why the U.S. Government would blame North Korea for something when the evidence suggested an inside job. 




 Rather than summoning the demon, we may be releasing the genie. Since Elon Musk is conjuring a pessimistic science fiction AI, he may also want to consider a more positive future AI like that found in the Culture universe of Ian M Banks.
 




 First rule of capitalism: if you can get away with it, do so.

 The more we progress as a society and as a species, the more the U.S. justice system looks like a big joke.
 




 Many of these laws are written by special interests trying to stifle new competitors.  Not sure how does a country espousing democracy gets to the point where companies write legislation?
