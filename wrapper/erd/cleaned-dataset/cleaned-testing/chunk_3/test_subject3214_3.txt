 I live in Hershey, PA where the Penn State Hershey Medical Center is located and includes the Children's Hospital. Families from around the country that suffer from pediatric cancer come to the Children's Hospital for care. All the money that is raised from THON is given directly to the Four Diamonds Fund which is a charitable organization that helps families pay for the entire cost of their child's cancer treatment that isn't covered by insurance. That goes for ANY child with cancer at the Children's Hospital. They provide amazing support for the families and also donate to pediatric cancer research. 

Since it started in 1973, THON has raised over $100 million for Four Diamonds. What these Penn State students do every year is amazing and so moving and the more attention THON and the Four Diamonds Fund get, the better!

If you're interested, here's the link to the THON and the Four Diamonds Fund websites where you can read up on what they do and even donate towards the total for THON 2015. FTK!!

 After Frank saved Meechum's job and then going so far as to put him on his Secret Service detail, Frank knew he had Meechum's loyalty for good. So I don't think he was worried about Meechum ever being disloyal. During the all-nighter with Doug when Frank made the call to get Meechum's job back he knew Meechum was going to be indebted to him indefinitely. It was insurance essentially: *"It requires very little of me and will mean the world to him. It's a very inexpensive investment."*

Maybe Meechum was waiting at the top of the stairs at the station or otherwise not around to see what happened. He was never around in the same room as Frank and Zoe during their other meetings. He was probably just told to wait in the car outside the Metro stop. I think he's clever enough to have pieced together what happened but not stupid enough to express his thoughts. He knows Frank is dangerous. 

Just my thoughts, but that's how I interpreted it.  














 But why do specific nations have to play against each other in order for it to be a "world" championship? If the best players in the world are playing in this league, why should it matter if it's Denver vs. Seattle or USA vs. South Africa for example? 









 The first time I heard this song I was 10 years old on a bus trip from Vegas to the Grand Canyon and the bus was playing the movie "Fools Rush In" with Matthew Perry and Salma Hayek. I love the Fallout references, but this song will forever be linked to Matthew Perry knocking up a chick on a one night stand for me.
