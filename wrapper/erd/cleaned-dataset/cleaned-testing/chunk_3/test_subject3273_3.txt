 Wutt? My home state on the front page of reddit?  




 Gosh that's sooo scary. I think I need to eat a donut to calm myself down. 




 Those stinkin Pugrats! 




 I imagine you live in a normal house, but when you go to work, or duty calls, you walk out to your back yard where there is a hatch that says "quarantine" on the back of it. You slowly make your way down the ladder where your co-worker, who we'll just call Desmond for the sake of the story, meets you and gives you the low down on the night before. You guys go into a dome shaped room where a computer sits in the middle of the room and you enter 6 numbers in a specific sequence. If you fail to enter the sequence in an alloted amount of time and hit return all of reddit will cease to exist. True or False? 




 It's a frog dog!  




 My father is a Criminal Investigator where I live and meth is a growing problem in our area. He has shown me several people's mug shots over the course of several years from the first time they came in (before/beginning meth use) and their most recent mug shot. The most recent picture ALWAYS looks like a completely different person that's 40 years older than they actually are. Unbelievable how that drug can affect you. 




 That's just how you live.
