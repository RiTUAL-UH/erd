 "Destitute Tier" haha 




 He doesn't really do a lot of fast action stuff except for the small amount of fighting at the end (that he doesn't do very well in). I'm sure you can get a clean, smooth picture but I'm most worried about the lag making it impossible to play shooters or faster paced games. Thanks anyways though.  




 My god look at that tiny HUD size. 




 How playable is it? Is there any lag/is it manageable?  




 What is that spectrometer at the top? 




 Oh my god, those visually similar images.... 




 Her facial proportions are a little off and frankly a little off-putting to look at (pic 7). I've seen a lot of Asian women and they don't look like this.  




 Does Tepper really need a new building? How about renovating something else first, say, Wean?  














 How do you get Samurize to work? Are you still on XP? 




 You have to install all available updates first before it shows up in the store.  




 Just try not using your laptop for a while and see if you can live without it. Only you can tell whether it will be a viable replacement for you.  




 No. 




 I think it's time to look into the pros and cons of using each product in real life rather than just the pros and cons of the computers themselves. If you're gonna be bringing it to class, the Alienware is going to be WAY too huge. I'd go with the blade. In my experience with college, portability and battery life are just SO incredibly important. If you do get the Alienware I would look into also getting a companion tablet or light netbook for you to bring to class with the money you save. They're both great computers that serve slightly different purposes (powerful all around computer vs. desktop replacement). Make your call while considering your lifestyle (do you plan on sitting in your room or going to the library to do work, lan parties with friends, etc.) and how you plan on using your computer (take it to class or leave it in your room). 

Also, technically it's not their first PC, as they have the Razer Blade Pro that was released a few years ago.  




 Even a $30 is WAY too much to spend on a screen protector. Just get a $5 to $10 one if one at all. I don't have a screen protector on my RT and it's just fine. My type cover protects it while in my bag.    




 Future economist right here.   




 Could be a one? 




 Let's blatantly overgeneralize an entire subset of people, that'll go over well.  




 It's a sorority hand sign. Forget which one in particular. 




 The Blade Pro is an outdated system by now. The new Razer Blade is the one you want to get. Switchblade is an old gimmicky system that most games don't support and is a feature I'd pay to get RID of, not to have. There's a reason they haven't updated the Pro/added Switchblade to the new Razer Blade.  














 I also have a stand-alone mic, not in the Picture. One of those Yeti microphones.  




 I do have Razer Surround, it sounds great.  




 I have it dual-booted to Ubuntu, I just need Windows for gaming.  




 This keyboard is AMAZING, much better than any membrane or chiclet keyboard in my opinion. The only downside is it's VERY loud, really clacky especially if you type fast (of courss, this could be seen as an upside to most people). If you have roommates or if you think you'll be bothered by the sound I'd recommend asking for the Steath version which uses different switches to be quieter. Personally, it doesn't bother me or my roommate and I kinda like the sound it makes. 




 Not sure? It's just a background I found when browsing google images. Link the the wallpaper has been provided on this thread already.  




 Yes, I have a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50s. I am interested in getting a pair of actual gaming headphones, though. The Razer Kraken 7.1 looks really nice at a reasonable price.  




 It's a Cooler Master Notepal U2 Laptop Cooling Pad, found [here](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834997730).  




 Yes, I LOVE this keyboard, I had the 2012 model before and just recently upgraded to this one (2013) with the Cherry MX Blues. It is very noisy, and I do have one roommate. Fortunately, he doesn't seem to mind it unless he's trying to sleep and I'm still up typing something. I guess it just depends on who you have as a roommate.  




 I made the Rainmeter skin myself, I will be posting it on /r/Rainmeter soon. Look for it there! 




 I do use my laptop screen frequently, but I would be interested in getting a stand to slide my keyboard under when I'm not using it. Thanks for the idea! 




 It's a skin I made myself actually. I am thinking of posting it onto /r/Rainmeter soon. Look for it there! 




 I prefer it for sure. It kinda braces your hand and wrist and allows for finer mouse movements. 




 I'm not really sure? It's been a long time since I've had it installed, so I don't really remember.  




 I am studying hard; I go to one of the country's best Computer Science schools. This is just a small hobby of mine, I don't intend to build some insane computer-built-into-desk-with-liquid-cooling-and-leds system. Just some suggestions on computer placement or small changes or some stuff that I haven't thought about would be nice.  




 Yeah, I re-installed windows and didn't install the beats audio drivers after. Honestly, beats doesn't sound all that bad on my laptop; I even think it makes the sound from the built-in speakers sound better. You can disable the equalizer and tweak the bass and stuff so it doesn't sound bad. 

But yes I do have it completely uninstalled and it sounds pretty much the same.  




 It's windows 8 with the programs Rainmeter and Stardock Objectdock. Objectdock gives me that menu on the left and Rainmeter gives me the bar on top and right side and the date and time in the middle. 

I actually have my laptop dual-booted for Ubuntu, which I prefer over Windows 8 for web browsing and stuff like that. When I want to game I switch over to Windows.  




 It uses a lot less bandwidth than Skype does, so in that sense it's better. Whether you like the sound quality is up to personal preference; Razer Comms tries to make your voice stand out above in-game audio but it can make it sound a little harsh and unnatural in my opinion. Just try it out and see what you think! 




 [Here](http://wlppr.com/wallpapers/2010/06/14/Slides_of_light.2880x1800.jpg) you go! 




 I would totally get a different desk if I could, but as this one came with the dorm I would rather stick with it. Plus I wouldn't have a way of keeping the desk for next year. For now, this is what I have.  




 HP Envy 14 Beats Edition. Not exactly the best laptop, it's about 2 years old. Definitely getting a new one soon.  









 Is it just me or does this cat look a little like Wall-E? 




 I see what you did there.  




 This article talks about having the battery *constantly* at 100%. As long as you let the battery go through charge cycles decently regularly (let the battery discharge to maybe 20% at least once a month) you shouldn't have an issue with reduced battery life.
