 !gameMe 




 I have it built, do you think it would be worth it to set up a server for it? Maybe I should message the subreddit mods and see if they approve of it running 24/7 for this subreddit. 




 lol yah. I'm having rate limitation issues. I need to build the bots karma up for a few days before I launch it fully. 




 D'oh, street view would be from a while ago .

I believe that the reference to Florida was just a story. That story was the one part of it that seemed too forced/fake.  




 Update: All done now, should be working on this subreddit as well
!gameMe 




 !gameMe 




 The banners don't match the ones in the videos, would they have changed them in two weeks? 




 !gameMe someServerThatDoesn'tExist 




 Don't we all need a little ego-boosting from time to time? ;) 
I can't really think of when it would be used either, but it'll be there if people want it.

(Also, I'm almost done now, so too late!) 




 There's a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7VQARbRhYA list=PLIvrgpZKZrKim6ga0LD3PBbopdqRQ3Lhf) of all the videos. It's terrifying, idk what's going on D:
 




 What is that in the [window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ-u4_sQSNk)!?! 









 I'm trying to play around with reddit's API, and I got a neat idea for a bot. a gameMe/hlstats bot that pulls your stats for a specific server and posts them as a comment. e.x.

test_subject3547: "!gameMe someServerName"
gameMeBot: "Pos: 9001 Points: 0"

You would associate your steam and reddit accounts with the bot by sending it a PM like "associate STEAM_0:XXXXXXXX"

Any interest/suggestions? I would probably make it search through this subreddit, /r/gaming, maybe /r/steam and any other subreddits for games tracked by gameMe.

Edit: I've got a prototype working, just working on customizing which server to pull stats from.
