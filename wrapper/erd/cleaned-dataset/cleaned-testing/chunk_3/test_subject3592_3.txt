 Suddenly I stop reading  
And my hands,   
They refuse to turn the page  

  
The words in the book  
Become a blur  
My eyes lose focus  
And my mind sees you  

My stomach reminds me  
Of a bird in a hailstorm  

My legs lose all feeling.  
The couch dissolves.  
The room disappears.  

There is only me  
And you inside.  

A halo of pain  
Places itself upon my head.  

And tightens.  

A crown of thorns.  

I do not understand how anyone can find this pleasurable

I laugh nervously to myself  
As my heart fills    
With the emptiness of the night   




 I think your content is good, but you seem to be in the same boat as me. We need to edit much, much more.

I'm having to be frank with you, but you (and I, that's why I'm saying this) aren't "natural" poets -- the kind that write a masterpiece in one sitting. 

We have poetic thoughts, then we put them down. But without refinement, we are just stones on a beach. 




 And capital! 




 That's true :) I've read a lot about his darkroom awesomeness. But I've never learnt photoshop, and I'm trying to get the photos in-camera to a decent level before I try! 









 I kept jumping from DE to DE like politicians on abortion, but once KDE 4.8 came out, I'm comfortable.

It's the best thing I've ever used. But it does require playing with settings a lot to get your desktop out of it. 




 Be brave and hang in there. Good to hear you are going to get help!

If you need someone to talk to, I am only a PM away. 




 Wow :)  




 Not for depressed people :(

Work on it? No.

Stop dwelling on it? No.

No. No. No.

Fuck. The picture makes sense. Why doesn't it work? 

No. No. No.

Maybe I should get off this subreddit. 




 Okay, that's just boolean logic (propositional?). Does not apply to axiomatic systems of proofs at all. I don't know the semantics of logic, really, but I meant the way of thought that we use in mathematical proofs. And transitivity (a = b and b = c  = a = c) is something that is not assumed in logic, but has to be proved.

The theory of vaccines, information technology and all that exist because people were willing to question everything. Which is just what I'm doing. 

 




 Oh I did not know that at all..What are the species of circularity? Is there anything I can read to know more?

The fact that launching a rocket and children throwing balls are similar changes nothing about the fact that we are not questioning the Scientific Method. The thing is, I am sure people have questioned it and have answered much better than me...So I'm just looking for sources, I guess.. 




 Shouldn't have brought God into the mix, sorry. I'm not worried about God at all...I just like thinking about these things.

Of course circularity is useless. When you have a circular proof with no way around it, it means you have an assumption you cannot prove. And that was what I was asking -- whether the Scientific method is such an assumption. It seems it is, for now at least. 

Which is not a bad thing at all. We have to start consistent thought somewhere :) 




 The scientific method is what makes me question the scientific method. That's the beauty of Science (and Philosophy I guess), right? You question everything, including your questioning...till you die! 




 1. Yes of course. And that very method allows to question the method itself. Which is all I'm doing. No God involved :)

2. Occam's razor tells us to choose the one that makes the fewest assumptions as our theory. Nothing about right or wrong since the competing theories already have to be able to explain the observations anyway.  




 Ah, this was exactly the kind of answer I was looking for!

But see ... you're using the method of proof by contradiction to demonstrate that E - mc2 = 0. And that method derives from the axioms of Math, which in turn are derived as hypotheses from the Scientific Method. I would love to see an axiomatic math researcher's (if that's what they're called) comments on this :D

Occam's razor as fundamental law makes sense I guess.

So it's an axiom...which leads to an interesting quandary whether you choose the axiom of Occam's Razor or whether you choose the axiom of God.

While I will always choose Occam's Razor because everything I do rests on it, I can't really tell a religious guy not to do it because half of everything he does rests on the assumption of God :-/ 




 No. God is an extra axiom that you would need in addition to the axioms of Science. 

Basically, God is not a necessary assumption you need to make to explain anything in the observable universe (yet), so God doesn't exist. That's the way I've understood it. 




 Ah...that makes sense...thanks! 




 I've been thinking of this question for a while now, but have been scared to post on here because of all the hostility on here. Though my questions have nothing directly to do with God or religion (only with concepts used in arguments), so I have hope!

Before you pick up your pitchforks, atheism is my description of choice, though I find the absence of God (or his imaginary presence) has very little relevance in my life.

So, I read through the popAtheism of Dawkins and Hitchens. I went reasonably deep into the philosophies of Science etc., so here's some questions I've ended up with (If I'm stupid, tell me, but also tell me why :) ) :

1/ Is there any justification for the Scientific Method? Well, of course it works. But it doesn't really do anything outside of the scientific method. You make a hypothesis, you do experiments, you make predictions, you do experiments, and you smile if it agrees and change the hypothesis if it doesn't.

So that's a good method. But is there any way "outside" of the Scientific method to justify it? Because proving/verifying a theorem/concept using itself is pretty useless.  

So any prediction made using the Scientific method is a validation of the hypothesis, not of the Scientific method itself.

Right? Or do I have something wrong somewhere?

2/ Occam's razor: This for me, was the strongest proof of the non-existence of God. Still pretty strong. Have a question about it:

So, Occam's razor says that given two hypotheses explaining the same set of observations/phenomena, you choose the one that makes fewer assumptions.

My question is: Isn't the Occam's razor itself an assumption?!

Of course, it IS certainly a **reasonable** assumption (far more reasonable than God) with a **valid** (in my mind) probabilistic justification (fewer assumptions means fewer ways of being wrong).

BUT: The justification itself depends on probability, which depends on the choice of mathematical axioms, which depends back on Occam's razor. Circular!

Is there something wrong with my logic? 




 Oh? Really? Wow...

How is it a flaw in security? Does it make your phone less secure? 

If say, they made phones easily rootable, would the phones be less secure? 




 Sorry if this question is stupid: 

I have a Motorola Bravo (very obscure phone) and linux and little patience -- a combination that has led to many attempts, all unsuccessful, at rooting.

Though this has got me wondering: Why do the carriers/manufactures make such a big deal out of rooting?

I understand that it voids your warranty, since you're messing with stuff at a low level.

But apart from that, why does it bother them so much? 

I've already paid for the phone, and am not paying any less by rooting it. I'm still paying the same amount monthly as I did before rooting the phone. 
So what's the difference to them?

It's like saying people can buy a plain t-shirt, but can't paint anything on it :-/

I'm sure there's something wrong in my logic...but can't see what.

EDIT: Well, that's cleared up...Thank you all :) Asking a question in a different time zone means you wake up to answers :D 




 Also, I did not know Sid stood for Siduction :D 




 Did you guys figure it out? The same thing happened to me yesterday.

A new problem is that 'kmix' seems to be crashing every time I login! 




 Indian reporting as requested!

I don't see what caste has to do with slums...People of all religions, castes and creeds live in illegal slums...but since you asked about caste, here I go.

It is important to keep in mind that *different  Indians see very very, different Indias*. So reporting today in this comment is a middlish class Bangalorean (big city) who lives in a nice sheltered area. Like many houses here, we have a lady who comes to do our dishes and to clean the house. 

The caste system is still in vogue, but I would say it's going out of style in the cities. ** For everyone above a certain economic class.** 

The servants (maids, cooks etc) are still all of lower caste (the converse is not at all true). Whether they are discriminated against or not ..... (to be continued) 

(the relationship between houses and the people who serve there are complex and involve many members of both families, exchange of gifts and the such..., it's very common for them to become extended family while still being servants)

(continued)...... it is undeniable that all of them are from the lower castes. 

So I would say (in my India), there isn't direct discrimination, but well...my mother wants me to marry someone from the same caste.

The history of the caste system provides some weak justifications for it, but as the great Ari Gold (Entourage) once said: There are no asterisks, only scoreboards.

Well, this isn't very informative. the **tl;dr** would be: There is no direct discrimination (in middlish class India in a big city), but there are a lot of conservative ideas because of which the caste system still carries import.

On the other hand, there is the issue of reservations in a lot of places for the "lower" castes...but that's a different discussion.
 




 Thanks!

I'll be alright, I guess :) 




 Oh *facepalm*! I had used alsamixer so much back in the day...Had completely forgotten about it! 




 Yup. There was no mic slider...I think veromix was fucking things up.. 




 Oh thanks! Will look at this! 




 I would have agreed with you yesterday morning. But when faced with evidence.....

The problem is with the way kmix/veromix interact with each other, I think...but can't say anything more. 




 I'm on Kubuntu 12.04 beta.

Yesteaday I had to video chat with a friend. I kept my mother's window laptop by my side on account of my experiences a few years ago. 

I installed the google video chat plugin and lo and behold, my webcam was working fine. But...my microphone wasn't!

So I installed unity and logged back into it and everything worked! 

Windows was kicked out the door.

Though I would have liked if it had worked on KDE, because I like KDE. 

Any ideas why it didn't work? I am using veromix with pulseaudio on KDE and the default soundmenu on unity. 




 Magnificent!!! :) 




 That's cool. I wish I was around so you would have an extra shoulder :) 




 Hang in there. I can't help you with much really, but I can tell you this after being through a lot education:

Take the courses you like! Work hard! Learn stuff! IT DOES NOT MATTER if you're unintelligent and you fail. IT DOES NOT MATTER if you're super intelligent and you get an A.

I mean, it does matter for a while, but believe me. I've failed and gotten As on courses and in a few years, all that will matter is that you took the courses you liked and tried to learn. 

Keep learning, keep studying. Keep working. Keep trying. 

You'll cry on some nights. Maybe many nights. Get through them and when you're reasonably okay again, focus on what you want and keep trying to do it.  




 **tl;dr** (Very long post... so putting a tl;dr at the top and the bottom): Was getting energy back in life. Lost it all again. Help needed.

I have to admit, I have not been diagnosed as depressed. I haven't even seen a therapist yet in my life. So I'm sure my problems aren't half as serious as the problems on this subreddit. Maybe I'm just weak. 28, male, single, failure, you know the usual. In any case, I would really appreciate some help.

Much of the last year was spent in a haze or sorrow and anger, mostly over a girl. It's not an uncommon story. I liked her, wasn't confident, didn't tell her (also, she had a boyfriend) and so traveled to the friendzone. (EDIT to add details: Burnt my fingers with cigarettes a few times, punched many trees and walls till my knuckles swelled up and I couldn't write a few times, drank a lot of whisky...nothing extraordinary inasmuch as life goes). Told her eventually and was told I had betrayed her 

(which was true, I don't deny. I should have told her long before...but it was lack of confidence, not an intention of ... oh whatever). 

We became friends again. We're roommates too now, so sometimes (since I see her daily) things still hurt in my heart. You know, the usual.

I am also doing a PhD in what would be considered one of the top 5 universities in my field with one of the top 2 people in my field. I said all that to indicate the irony that I'm going nowhere with it. He doesn't care what I do. If I was self-motivated enough to do something about all this, it would all work out. All I need to do is sit down and work. But I don't. You know, weak...the usual.

The end of last year, I decided I would turn a new leaf and fix my life, one step at a time, however small those steps were. I told some people on this very subreddit about my brilliant idea and got a lot of encouragement, and was even told I helped one or two! I started exercising, and dressing better and walking with my back straight. It was all getting better.

Then my mom got two tumours in her spine. She had one in her brain, and was on the road to recovery (or the equivalent for brain tumours). She had survived (even lived, you could say) two years longer than the 18 months she was promised. And then two completely new guys cropped up in her spine. Now she's completely immobile. I came back home to help and now can't go back to university for useless visa issues. 

Which means I might lose my job. 

The thing is, I was okay with all of this. But today morning, I realized I've lost all energy. Completely drained. I have close friends, but I don't particularly want to talk to any of them about it, becuase I've realized they don't understand. You know, the usual.

So, please help reddit. I have no energy left to start all over again on my smallStepsTheory.

**tl;dr**: Was getting energy back in life. Lost it all again. Help needed.
 




 Ah okay, that makes sense...thanks! I was wondering what was changing in the wings... 




 Loaded in what way? Cargo? Why do the wings differ in height when the cargo is loaded? 




 I maybe stupidly misinformed...but is Prince Philip the queen's husband?

"The queen's husband Prince Philip..."

EDIT Oh nevermind. Someone else asked and was answered below
 




 The kid doesn't understand much because he's young...that's what I think/thought. 




 There was a time when I used to think this was a song by Boyzone and how awesome the lyrics were awesome even though it was by them :D 




 Interesting answer. Thanks!

I'm not asking if the voltage exists in an existential way. I'm asking in the way us atheists say God doesn't exist because nothing He/She/It/Spaghetti does is measurable. 

So for the battery, the voltage has meaning ONLY when the battery is connected, i.e. when the voltage can be measured (or if it can be measured in some other way, that's fine too).  

However, before the battery is connected, the voltage is still Measurable, because I know that connecting the terminals will set up a current etc. 

I was wondering if the above two things are in fact the same, and it is meaningless to talk about the "measurability" of something without actually keeping the possibility of measuring it in mind. 




 So is its existence accepted fact? Or are experiments still being conducted to verify whether it actually exists or not?

EDIT: http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html They (It?) have (has?) been detected and measured...Not sure what you were trying to imply.

EDIT 2 : Okay they are still trying to measure them..sorry :) But doesn't put the spectrum on the same standing of scientific acceptability as the Higgs Boson? Something that's "supposed" to be there, but we can't see yet and will hopefully see when we experiment or else the world will fall apart?

 




 I just replied on a [comment thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/rbhve/how_do_the_heart_rate_sensors_at_a_gym_work/c44l5ra) and that sparked my curiosity about this:

The question is: Is there a distinction in Science between "measurable" and "measured"? Can the potential between two battery terminals, for example, be considered a physical quantity before it's measured?

I guess it's kind of a stupid question....but I' not sure!
 




 This is a tangent onto a philosophyOfScience question... I was under the impression that in Science, nothing exists if it's not measured.

Or maybe "measurable" is different from "measured" ... New thread required? 









 :) Good luck! Don't hesitate to make your step even smaller if this doesn't work! Keep trying to keep moving in the right direction :) 




 Well, it wasn't a waste of time. I got to do a fun analysis :) 




 Oh no :( 




 Never seen that meme used better. The final frame really hit me hard....Completely feel your feelings there! 









 I did my own calculations based on the numbers on his website. 

It's not like I read "I flew!" there and believed it immeditaely. 
 




 Can't argue with that :) 




 Yeah even 2 Hz is enough for him to get the lift he requires. I used 10 Hz more out of excitement than anything else.

He's said he needs 2 KW of power for his weight, which is what the battery he's using provides.

EDIT (because I got some more free time): With 2 Hz, he'll need to run at around 6.5 m/s, which is a pretty easy sprinting speed (with weight attached). Good point though...With such heavy wings, 10 Hz would be crazy! 

EDIT 2: I saw your videos. You have to realize that this guy's ornithopter is not even close to being as impressive as the ones you've posted. This is just some guy hacking together a thing that flies. It hardly does anything new in any way. Which is why I can't understand why people are so surprised by it! 




 It's not human powered, only human controlled. 




 See thread below. It's not necessarily fake. 




 Yes...Fun :) Especially if it concerns aerodynamics 




 Phew! Please tell me you're convinced of the aerodynamic feasibility :)

Again, I can't comment on the photoshoppiness of the thing... 




 You are completely right...Oops! :)

Here really, L/D doesn't matter. As long as he can attain the lift, he'll get into the air. And then fall out very quickly of course, but he will still get up!

However, his wing area is 15 m^2.

Part 2 of calculations...Note that I have no problem with you being right. In fact, the way this currently is: I am assuming you're right and hoping to prove you wrong.

CL = 1.4  
L = 100 kg (Seems he has a 20 kg backpack)  
S = 18 m^2 (From his website)  
rho = 1.225    

V = sqrt(100 * 9.8 * 2 / (1.225 * 18 * 1.4) ) = 7.96 m/s


So, now the question is if 7.96 m/s is possible. It means you run 100 m in 12.5 s. That is unfortunately extremely fast, but not unattainably so. All he needs to get in the air is maintain that speed for 2 s. Then flap hard enough.....not convincing

In any case, I guess the tide is currently in your favour. 

I got some hope based on a WIRED article ([http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/humans-with-bird-wings/](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/humans-with-bird-wings/)) 

But that article says nothing, really.

So, for now without further information (and even though he flew clumsily and came down pretty quickly), I have to say you must be right, though there is still hope for the man :)


************ BUT WAIT!!! ******************

(Sorry for getting excited. I generally get that way when I get a sudden realization of what I was doing wrong) 
EDIT! : I made a mistake. Flapping CL doesn't depend only on V, it also depends on the flapping speed itself!!! 

Phew. I knew I was making a mistake.

So, let's say he runs at 6 m/s. And flaps at 10 Hz (10 times per second). The average speed (which on the back of an envelope can be assumed to be acting over the whole wing. Of course, the root won't move at all and the tip will move much faster) of up and down motion will be 10 Hz * 5 m (half span)/2 = 25 m/s.  There's my answer...

So the net speed the wing will see will be sqrt(6^2 + 25^2) which is far greater than what is required to get him in the air with a CL of 1.4. In fact, even with a CL of 1, he will still be able to get off the ground.

His low L/D of course, will bring him back down pretty quickly, which is what happened (he couldn't even fly for 10 s).

So I am convinced that his flight is CERTAINLY aerodynamically possible. 

Thanks for your observations...Because of them, I do think these calculations are correct now :)
 




 Ah, that's better.

I don't see why it's impossible. You have a good point there about the lift. Maybe you're right... Let's calculate see what CL is required. 

Lif = mass * gravity = 80 kg * 9.8  
Wing area = 10 m^2 (say 10 m span and 1 m chord)  
rho = 1.225 kg/m^3

Now let's find out what CL you need to have to get a running speed of say 12 mph  -- a speed that shouldn't be hard to attain with significant weight on your back.

So,  

CL = m * g / (0.5 * rho * S * V^2)  
     = 4.45

A CL of 4.45 is not high for a flapping airfoil (This one is in fact a nicely cambered airfoil cross section) since it generates generates lift both through unsteady and steady effects. 

See Fig 2 on page 4 of ([http://web.mst.edu/~isaac/AIAA-2006-0450.pdf:](http://web.mst.edu/~isaac/AIAA-2006-0450.pdf). 

The frequency there is about 2 flaps per second at it gets to a CL of 3 which is in fact certainly lower than for the guy, since he's flapping at a higher frequency. His Reynolds number is also higher than for the paper, which would mean CL is in fact higher than the paper).

So, back of envelope calculations support the dutch guy. 

An L/D of 4 is certainly not high. Gliders have (L/D)max of up to 60. A Boeing 747 has one of 17.  But those are designed for high L/Ds (so is his wing probably, but let's not give him the benefit of doubt just yet). 

A flat plate moving at an angle of attack of 5 degrees (no unsteady effects, so the value I get here will be conservative) has an L/D of approximately 5! (using the formulae in[ http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/kiteincl.html](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/kiteincl.html))

So L/D of 4 is achievable too. In any case, I'm sure his drag was pretty high, which is why he came down so quickly.

So I guess your apprehensions are answered. I had fun doing the calculations :)

I mean, look at the guy. He flew for maybe 100 m and then came back down. It's not particularly impressive. But it's certainly not impossible.

A different thread on reddit however, talks about inconsistencies in the video (pixels and what not). Now, my specialty is aerodynamics, so I cannot comment on that :D

EDIT: Made a mistake in the calculations (didn't convert from mph to m/s) 




 Right...because that's what believers do when they see something they doubt. They go hunting for answers to their questions. 




 You're not crazy, but it's probably not fake. Some common arguments against it:

1. Human power is not sufficient for this: The aircraft if NOT human powered. A wii controller picks up his motions , passes through an Android phone which does the processing to give similar motion to the wings. 

2. Flat wings can't generate lift/Up-down wing motion can't generate lift: The motion is not up-down. The wing is not flat. The cross section is an airfoil designed and the wing is designed with spars and ribs just like any model aircraft.

It required some digging and reliance on Google translate on the man's dutch website to get the above information.

So, you're not crazy, but it's not fake. It's also not that impressive. The thing basically is just an ornithopter that is getting it's control input from a human.  




 Shankar Tucker not equal to John McLaughlin. He plays songs from movies and in general, I like the original more.

In any case, that's just my opinion. Indian Classical Fusion FTW! 




 The next morning. In fact, it's worse today, which is the next-to-next morning after the swelling. 




 I had been waiting a long time for someone to teach me to use the weights and bars in the gym. I have always been more of a running+stretching kind of guy.

So two days ago, I met a friend with whom I worked out for an hour. We did squats, bench presses and bicep/tricep stuff with dumbbells. 

Today, my left shoulder (the place where the shoulder becomes the arm) is hurting quite badly. While I attribute this of course, to bad form, I am not sure which of those exercises caused this...Any help would be appreciated, thank you1 




 I'm like you, except I'm 28 and I'm starting to walk with my back straight now! Go for it, keep taking these steps and eventually maybe hopefully possibly, you'll wake up more than 2 days out of 7 happy. If you do, consider all the effort worth it :) 




 If you run today and still do 11:30 for 2.4 km, I don't think you have any reason to worry.

I was doing 3 miles in 25 minutes, and now (three months later), I do 5 in 35, and this was without any training program or even a goal, whatsoever.

I'm sure that with a structured program, you will do great. For your distances, I would recommend reading training programs for reducing times for 2000 m and 1000 m races. Programs with slow days, distance days and fast days seem to work best.

Good luck! 




 I have done this and it works pretty well. The only two glitches for me:

1. Calls do not connect sometimes. But this happens very very rarely. And when it does, redialing again gets the call to go through.

2. Texts aren't received/sent randomly. This happens often enough to cause me pain. Especially bad is when I'm texting and the phone is switching from Wifi to 3G or the other way.

3. No texting without 3G.

I'm on AT T by the way... 









 I'm sick today and my neck is sprained like never before. It's hurting so much I can hardly move. 

Feels good not to think about other things :)

EDIT: "Feels good", not "Feels not good"...Shit...I can't even get a post right! 




 There's a ppa available too (and has been for some time now):

http://www.webupd8.org/2011/03/sublime-text-2-ubuntu-ppa.html

 




 Oh shit...I commented on the wrong thread! I was about to tell you that the OP is talking about the Transformer Prime and telling him about a 7" tablet may not be useful.

Oops. I should downvote myself for this! 




 7 inches though 




 Where is this place? 




 Wow, I am glad to have helped :) The table part is a true story!

I am male and 27... Can't afford (monetarily at least) to think about therapy or medication yet as a graduate student, but basically wasted away most of the last 1.5 years in a haze. 

It's still not easy though. On bad weather days (as [Stephen Fry](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/10/it-will-be-sunny-one-day.html) calls them), it's not easy at all for me to believe that this system will work. But I try to believe him and wait for it to pass. 
 




 I was/am in the same boat as you. 

But I have realized that things can get slightly better if you start accepting "slightly better" as an option.

And "slightly" is really really slightly. I thought I would clean my room, I didn't. I thought: Fuck the room, let me clean my table. I didn't. Eventually I settled for buying $3 bin from Walmart and dumping stuff from the table into it. So the table looks clean now.

Tomorrow, I will make my bed. The table will get dirty again. I'll put it in the bin again.

I guess what I'm trying to say is don't try to force yourself to take a step if you don't feel like it. Keep reducing the size of the step till you can actually take it. 

This is getting long and maybe irrelevant, but a friend and I were discussing motivation today: We realized we have come to be depressed because we expected the sky from our lives and were not motivated enough to actually do anything to get there. While we have had this discussion many times before, today was particularly enlightening since we also realized that while not doing anything to reach the sky, we had actually dug a deep hole for ourselves into the ground and jumped in.

So now, we have to first put in effort to reach the ground. Before that, we have to accept that we are at the bottom of a pit. Then, we climb one step out. Which for me meant exercise half an hour every two days. When I couldn't do that, I exercised 15 minutes every two days. Now I'm upto half an hour every day. Eventually, I'll be happy. That's the hope.  




 I am in the friendzone and I have to say, the discussion here is far more helpful and informing than the one on r/funny. 

Though I guess [/r/funny](/r/funny) isn't meant for help anyway. So power to both! 




 Leaving for work. I put on my shoes and my jacket fifteen minutes ago. 

Now Imma sweatin'   
and  Imma redditin' 




 What?! Art majors don't lead a fulfilling life?

As an engineer, I've been blaming my choice of major for my lack of fulfillment all along, telling myself that if I'd taken up writing like I wanted to, I would have been happy now. 




 No. There is a lot to see...it was different actually being here, of course!

Though I completely agree with you about getting out of the inhabited areas...National Parks FTW!! 




 Hmm...I'm indian, and this is an actual conversation I had:

White Woman: So in India, do you really go to school on elephants?  
Me (laughing making it obvious I was joking): No. We have camels for that.  
WW (laughs too): So what did you think of the US when you first came here?  
Me: It was just like the movies!   
WW: Which movie?  
Me: Terminator.

Unknown to her, I wasn't joking! Apart from the action, the country looked exactly like in the movies and people seemed to act exactly like in the movies. 

Hmm...This is kind of irrelevant to the question, I just realized. But...since I've typed it all....

 




 I think I have said somewhere else on this reddit before that there are two schools of Yoga. Well, there are many, but there are two major schools that come to mind on reading the article:

1. The "modern" school - They believe that the final pose is what matters in Yoga. Props like ropes, stools and weights are used to get people to the final pose. This is why it is so painful. This is also why it is good for some people who are already physically ready for it.
2. The "classical" school based on Patanjali's teachings - [Patanjali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pata%C3%B1jali) is a guy who lived long ago and happened to organize all the teachings of Yoga upto the point into "Sutras". His idea was that the main purpose of Yoga is to lead up to ultimate peace of mind and oneness with the body (and well..the spirit - whatever that is). The asanas are just routes to this. With this second route, most of what the article says falls flat and this is what I have been taught, though I am sure the first method has its own advantages.

One that is completely absent in Western teaching: The guru/teacher has to teach each student individually based on his/her physical and mental abilities and the student in turn places complete trust in the teacher.  




 I can recommend a book for sure: "The Anatomy of Yoga" by David Coulter. 




 That is what it translates to exactly. Sava is corpse, Asana is pose (or exercise). Don't know why you would consider it silly :-/ 




 I went to a cemetery once when I was depressed and just sat there. It was about a girl, so it was easy to be depressed.

Eventually, I felt randomly peaceful and went to an interview that I had scheduled. The interview went well and I went back into the depressed state for a while.

Got off-track there. tl;dr: Went to cemetery and spoke, but to myself. 




 I took up writing and exercise. Sad and lonely makes for good poems that you hate when you write them, but look better later (much later, as in months or years) when you look back and maybe edit them.

Exercise is well...exercise. It's what I do to make the rest of the day slightly brighter. 

I think what makes you think video games are wasted time is that you have nothing to show for it after the act. But you can look at it one of two ways: It doesn't matter, or if it matters, do something that lets you create or that leaves something with your mind after it's over. 

Like poetry or art or music or woodwork or photography or rock climbing or hiking. Those are random examples, of course. 

Though none of this will make you better immediately. That (I believe) is a gradual transformation. Doing things will get you stage where you can look at yourself without the self-deprecation that is so normal for people like us. Then, you can start working on being better. At least, that is what I believe and I working towards. I hope you can come along with me on this journey.

Feel free to PM me to talk or anything! 




 Nope. The respective combinations are...For me at least... 




 What's a cervesa? 




 Wow...I can totally see why you call this a wuss story, because that's what I call my life too. But I've realized that we are way more critical of ourselves than the world. We give others far more credit than we do ourselves.

Remember this: You have a girlfriend (I'm assuming you have a happy relationship) and you're healthy, which means you can do whatever you want with your life. I don't know the logistics of what you're trying, but maybe you can transfer to Science/Math in college? EDIT: And you're honest with yourself. Which is more than most of the world can say for itself. With this honesty and your apparent will to follow your dreams, I am sure you will do great at whatever you finally settle into.

I know exactly what you're going through because I went through very similar things and still struggle with these issues. The issues don't go away, unfortunately. But you do get better at dealing with them. 




 Your post is inspiring! Thanks!! 




 I don't have any good things left and I lost all meaning in my life recently.

I'm trying to get back at life by exercising daily, trying to eat well and sleep well. I am completely alone and I sometimes wonder why the fuck I'm trying anything when all I am is a tree that's falling in the forest with no one to see or hear it.

But just keep at stuff. Keep at something. Keep at anything. Forget about trying to get your chin up. Be sad and still keep doing things. Your chin coming up (sorry I'm using that idiom so carelessly) should be a side effect of what you are and what you do. 




 I asked exactly the same question a few days back in a thread :)

http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/nxkra/new_to_rfitness_welcome_and_discuss_your_getting/c3csj9o?context=3 




 I just want to say that I've always dreamed of riding horses and I have no idea why you think it's stupid. 

Take it a day at a time. Follow Stephen Fry's advice posted on here a few days back (http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/10/it-will-be-sunny-one-day.html). 

I can only say that every day, try to worry about one thing. It would do you good to realize (only on sunny days of course, try your best not to make decisions on the stormy ones) that while your problems are way too much to be solved together, if you work on one (*and only one*), the others knots will begin (only begin, but it's something) to untangle.

Sorry for the vague advice, but PM me if you want and I can tell you how I'm dealing with my shit. 




 Ah. I was about to edit my comment to ask :) Well, I will be going to the smoky mountains sometime in the Spring from Illinois, so I'll make sure I ask on reddit before leaving! 




 I'll tell you what I went through, and maybe that will help (I'm a PhD student, so I can attest for sure that the graph as you currently have it is accurate):

1. High school -- All cool
2. College -- It goes wildly downhill and then wildly uphill and then wildly downhill
3. Grad School Part I (the MS) -- Similar to college, except it's not as wild.
4. Grad School Part II (the PhD) -- For me, it just kept going downhill and downhill till i was a broken wreck. I was a robot walking around. I couldn't work, and I couldn't rest. I was staring at the screen and it seemed like I was a worm eating myself up from the inside. 

I used to tell people that I had used up all my willpower to get out of bed and get to my office, so I had none left to actually do any work. 

Now it's slightly better. Somedays I'm a worm and somedays I work. 

The days that I get work done give my life meaning and the days that I'm a worm give the work value. 




 India, where we have many other things :D 

Somehow, when I was in college in India, we either went out to drink or we went out to eat. We never really had the concept of drinking and eating at the same time at a restaurant, except for Biryani and Kingfisher beer :D 




 Hope I/someone can help you out there and I really hope you get through this well :) 




 Nope. Will certainly keep a look out for it and try, though...Thanks! 




 Well, beer. As a grad student, I don't get to drink the Buds and the Millers, though I can say with confidence that they're quite bad. 

I'm not really good at choosing good beer, but I can say for sure that I like Corona, Dos Equis, Delirium, and IPAs 




 [/r/depression](/r/depression) Lots of people going through similar/wildlyDifferentButKnowExactlyWhatYouMean there 




 Been here a while now, and these are my favourite things that I had not eaten before getting here;

1. Burger, beer and fries -- Ah, the combination!
2. String cheese
3. Pizza and coke
4. (Honorary mention) Blueberry milkshake
5. (Honorary mention) Hashbrowns, Omelette and toasted bread 




 Rice Lentils with spices and stir fried vegetables with other spices and super spicy pickled vegetables followed by rice with  yogurt! Oh sometimes with chips or fried indian "papads"

Makes me happy thinking about it as I eat pasta with butter and parmesan with white wine and green beans on the side

(I love cooking and eating)
