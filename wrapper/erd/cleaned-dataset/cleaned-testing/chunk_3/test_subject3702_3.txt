 it sounded like a yoke 




 as somebody who barely makes 25k working shit hours in a kitchen, 100k is a milestone to wealth and prosperity for me. 




 U2 *is* gay 




 dude, working for google means you get dibs on tickets for Google IO, which is in it's self worth it. 




 It's crazy that that shit happens, I have an aunt threw same way. 




 you know... I'm going to take this goddamn moment to complain. When I was her age, we went out, and got a godamn fake ID. Or, we just borrowed someone's ID and said, "welp, hope I don't get this shitty expensive thing I just bought taken away from me..." But now, no. No no no. Now, you first have to get on reddit and validate you're actions with some anonymous other people. BAH! 

...I'm a bit drunk right now. 




 Yeah... Yeah, they do. 




 how, may I ask, is this nsfw? 




 perhaps I'm heartless. But if that were me, I'd have that cat back at my parents before that girl could even give me the sads. I'm across the country and I still love my cat. 




 Now is the time to begin cultivating skills that you enjoy doing. Skills can always be applied to different careers later in life. 




 your uncle Jerry is a good man, 




 yup 




 you can pull off a fedora with a polo, chinos and boat shoes. 




 Wearing a fedora is fine in my book if:

* You are wearing appropriate clothes that would warrant a fedora.

* The fedora is not a twenty dollar piece of shit you bought at hot topic
 




 You sure taught her... You fucking ass clown. 




 lol I cannot believe you are getting downvoted for this shit. This is a general trend of ignorance that's getting greater by the day. 

But anyway, in the case of hitting a dog I **pretty sure** that you're partly right here. But reporting it being legally required depends on specific counties. Now, if it damages your car... You can report it to the police and then go after the owner.  




 It looks better on him. 




 It is very interesting. I wasn't disagreeing with you, just throwing my two cents in... I grew up with two teetotaling parents. Well, one really, and one that was just in constant recovery. 

As a kid, I often thought exactly what your comment was saying. 




 pretty sure you're wrong. 




 It's about fucking time. 




 I would like to say that it is a wrong strategy. 




 not being able to keep a steady job, or maintain a healthy relationship because you have to drink. Drinking so much that it could potentially kill you if you stopped. 

I drink, but I've also seen how alcohol ruins lives. 

Cigarettes will give you a heart attack at 55 maybe, or put a hole in your throat, or fill your lungs up with delicious tar etc etc... But booze can turn a person into a shade of what they were.  




 I laughed. 




 congrats, you ruined a man's life forever because of a petty childhood relationship. 




 uhh, what fucking signs of autism are you seeing exactly? 




 This comment should get more upvotes.  




 Jesus christ 




 I'll post this in the main thread in hopes that it will get over looked, but why should we be banning animal testing? 




 I would've used this grammar, "just... A little... Closer." But it's all good. (im drunk right now) 




 Protip: if you clean only the bathroom, she will love you forever. And it's not even that hard. it's just like cleaning up the mousetraps, or squashing spiders, a mans job. Think of it that way, and you'll be set. 




 As a guy, im frustrated when I can't find any pins, it means I haven't had a girl over in a while. Begin crippling anxiety. 




 uhm... wat? 




 hey now, the man knew what he wanted and asked politely. Imagine he had seduced you, got you back to his place and *then* tried to get you to go down on him in the shitter? 




 amen, brother. Shitty girls are shitty. 




 The idea, I believe, is to buy it in small quantities from many locations as to not draw attention.  




 This trick saved me in college. I was fortunate enough to have an awesome Russian professor who taught the whole class how to use the debugger and debugging techniques in my first year programming class. Later in both my algorithms classes I couldn't believe that kids didn't have basic debugging skills.   




 I just snorted coffee through my nose... 




 when you talk in real life, do fart noises come out? 




 thank you for addressing these points without resorting to ad hominem like I would have. 




 ahem.. I believe, if I am permitted to speak with the current vernacular of /b/, being a 4chan user for 3 years pretty much makes you, well, it makes you a "newfag cancer" ... Or so I'm told. 

I came here to say that in a non offensive way. Now, let's see if I get downvoted or not.  




 He could be a junkie

shuuutt the fuck up. 




 And this surprises you? 




 I'm kind of into bridges myself. I found a whole case of eggs under a bridge last week. Perfect condition. None of them missing, none of them cracked. I mean, who in their right mind throws away a perfectly good case of eggs in this day and age. 




 You know, you're right. Fucking kid is an asshat. You're doing god's work, son. 




 really? someone bought you reddit gold for this?
 




 It's hard to tell what you're saying here... It's also hard to tell which way I feel.  




 giggity 




 Alright BobbyBacula, I'm now convinced you're trollin. 




 for crying out loud, thank you! I want to smack these people around sometimes. Just little smacks though, nothing too violent. 




 why? 




 shooot her! 




 [to be read in an insulting tone of voice]

I believe the maximum temperature ok mars' surface is below freezing. These rocks would not be warm to us.  




 nah dude. alcohol is a magical thang  




 I was quoting the video game Mass Effect. 




 IF only we made some sort of discovery. One that would jump us ahead 200 years technologically... 




 Hey hey hey, this isn't fair! Some scientists have sex...once. 




 People are downvoting  this, which frustrates me... Because I've never liked the guy, for the above stated reasons. Now I know that there are more of you out there, I don't have to hide anymore! 




 I was a little shy in high school, but I had a couple of girlfriends and wasn't afraid to socialize, fell into a few cliques etc... I'm not sure if many high schools are like this in the country, but I grew up in an extremely controlled environment. We were not allowed to leave the building for any reason whatsoever with out a proper escort (usually the hall monitor, or school police officer), and were to be under constant supervision between school operating times. For after school activities, an adult was to be present at all times.

Now, I know that these precautions were taken for legality issues, but my point is that we were treated like children in an unhealthy way. I also know that under the eyes of the law most of us were still legally children. But the negative aspect of this type of coddling led to discouraging a lot of the kids there from doing important things early on.

Okay, so now to my point. When I got into college I still felt like a kid. I did well in school, I did well in life (mostly) but I had no fucking idea that I could actually **DO** things. I spent so much time in the later parts of high school feeling like anything I tried to accomplish wouldn't be taken seriously because I was still a child, and feeling discouraged because I thought that anything I tried to do independently would be perceived as childish, that I ended up doing nothing at all. I only realized that I had an ability to accomplish things greater than assignments and orders from older people when I was almost finished with college. And this, I feel, put me at a serious disadvantage. I realized later in life than some that the most important aspect of accomplishment is taking initiative. I was too happy going to school, having friends and getting drunk because it was what I was "supposed to be doing." 

**TLDR: I regret not realizing that I could take life by the balls in high school** 




 This is actually sound advice if you work in a kitchen. 




 hahaha, in all fairness he did say, "Jay-Z is in the empire business," a little while ago. 




 came here for all the pansies yelling about abuse. leaving only mildly disappointed cause I had to scroll down a bit. 




 Oh! I doubt I'm going to give you any ammo for "abuse" really. I didn't really consider at the time that you may have been joking, and was trying to point out that the statement is idiotic because what the original poster said had nothing to do with linking the evolutionary fertility of rabbits to gas powered lawn mowers. 

Simply that rabbits have to be so fertile because they so often choose poor locations for their nests. The guy was offering consolation, in that for some little bunnies that get mowed to pieces, hundreds more are getting eaten by various predators cause momma rabbits can't get their shit straight. So there will be more of these little fuckers running around in no time, which is great to think about when you just accidentally chopped a bunch of them up. He was offering consolation, not applying for a grant to study the evolutionary traits of rabbit breeding. 

And that, good sir, is why you were an idiot for posting that remark. But hey, you got the karma for it... so it looks like I'm the one with egg on my face.  




 No! I'm going to take this side of the story: you didn't fuck up at all. It should be fine for you to have pictures of naked girls and have a girlfriend. You shouldn't be embarrassed about any of it. She needs to be secure enough to know that a male can and will view pornography regardless of whether or not he's got a fuck buddy, gf or wife. Plain and simple. 




 dude don't even worry! now the pressure is off of you. She knows, and you know that she knows. Now you don't have to hide the fact that you are making certain life decisions for yourself. 

edit

To be clear... I'm not saying you should or shouldn't be doing anything. Just that you are becoming a man now. 




 start going in drunk! they can never accuse you again! 




 yup. You fucked up big time d00d. 




 I think it would most likely fall under libel... but anyway, I'm not a lawyer, but these charges are usually avoided if you can prove you were not doing it with the intent to defame and instead had the intent to make a farce of, or lampoon the subject. 




 aww, not the worst thing in the world. I'm sure the boyfriend and friend didn't mind a whole lot ;) 




 I prefer to take the Gob route with, "Hey guy!" 




 I want to pet the penguin 




 You are an idiot for posting this. 




 The falcon is fine. It flies off every day. During that time it's probably eating whole prey. It's flying back because it's got one of those smart raptor brains. 




 Implying that Huskies are really strong? Or really good dogs? 




 how to cook a fucking meal! and not some simple shit like boiling pasta and adding canned tomato sauce. Or make pancakes in the morning.

You shouldn't be afraid to cook any kind of meat. Knowing how to prepare simple chicken, pork and beef dishes is important. Also, know what vegetables are and how to use them.

This skill is so useful in life, because it will get you laid.  




 I don't think that you should be desensitized to listen to/watch something like this. It's about understanding the thing that happened and knowing that it did. Perhaps there is some kind of catharsis involved as well. 
It's similar to Eisenhower wanting the world to see what the nazis had done in the concentration camps. Not only desensitized people went to view the atrocities, many people went for different reasons. And we still learn about them today as a reminder of the fucked up things that have happened in history in order to potentially prevent them from happening again. 

I guess to sum things up, "it's great to learn, 'cause knowledge is power!" 




 yeah, It's really easy to say things like this. But enduring months upon months of barely eating will drive you crazy. I'm sure that these were good people, for the most part. 




 watch a movie. 




 could you perhaps offer some justification for your opinion? or are you just some troll? 




 I think... I think I love you. 




 man this used to work for me... but now it just makes me paranoid, and coupled with being hungover, I feel like I'm going to die. :( 




 you think that's bad. Try watching someone at a casino screaming about getting more of their money. 




 I think mostly because we read the news for the reporting of facts. Creative style shouldn't have to be parsed from an article to understand the facts. Embellishment leads to misrepresentation. 

Also, I would find it very annoying if I had to read this shit when I was trying to get my news in on the bus to work.  




 okok.. so is this a new thing we're doing? It's like the fourth time I've seen this tonight. 




 nor should they 




 no
