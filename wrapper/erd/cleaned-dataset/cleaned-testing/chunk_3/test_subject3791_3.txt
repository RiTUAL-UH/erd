 Recommended by Snowden is their cloud storage service, not the password manager. But i guess he would use it anyway. 




 A movie database is a tool I use everyday. I always support open source and openness, so I'd like to have that choice, in the same way we have duckduckgo for Google. 



















 Me too, just boring...

 Yeap, me neither. It wasn't horrible, but not a masterpiece. Just a decent DiCaprio flick.

 Not imgur, doesn't support ico. 









 I wanted to use this for my Tumblr blog ([their own uploading tool](https://www.tumblr.com/themes/upload_static_file) doesn't seem to accept .ico).

The solution i found is to host the .ico on Dropbox and just use the direct link to that :) (**you just get the direct link, delete everything after the .ico extension and replace http with dl**). 




 Weren't they able to record those clips on normal speed? 









 Mmm, maybe i chose the wrong sub. I want to host a favicon for a Tumblr blog. 









 It's better to sleep a few hours that nothing at all.

 That's great. Someone is keeping an eye for me.

 Coca Cola Vanilla is quite rare here in Greece (which means that you are extremely lucky if you find a place that sells it). It used to be sold everywhere 10-12 years back. 









 When I get a hiccup, I can stop it almost immediately by concentrating on it.

 Hello. This might sound stupid to you, but i'm having problem disconnecting the power cord that connects my GPU (an Asus GTX 770) with my power supply (Evga Supernova NEX650G).

In fact, i can't disconnect it at all :p.

It's that red cord that you can see in the photo here: http://imgur.com/YQxkH5P

No matter what i try, it won't disconnect, like it's stuck.

Is there a special way to do it?

Thanks in advance.

 Tumblr is a better solution that a self hosted Wordpress blog (in my case).

Yes, from what i see, there is no easy way to do this.

Anyway, thanks! 




 Hello. I want to move my self hosted blog from Wordpress to Tumblr. I have ~750 posts with images. So, i'd like to move them to my Tumblr blog and keep their permanent url (and my custom domain of course). I'm more interesting on moving ther text/permanent link/tags, not the images (but i'd like to import them too).
Is there any tool/way to do that?
Thanks!
