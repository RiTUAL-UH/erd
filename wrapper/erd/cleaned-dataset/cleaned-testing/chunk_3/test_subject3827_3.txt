 That's what I thought - did you do it by hand or use the colorization tools? 




 What did you use for it? 




 Rich Stoklasa 




 Iz funny 




 Star Wars Sequel Trilogy - I *need* to know what happens! 




 Yeah, I watched The Godfather this week and it was utterly horrible compared to Kung Fury

Edit: (/uj) I actually forgot I was browsing /r/moviescirclejerk for a moment and I thought this was an actual /r/movies thread (/rj) 




 It's stupid to say something is unfairly judged by critics. That's why they are critics, is because they are qualified to be judging something. If the unanimous decision of the critics is that the movie is bad, then it might be true for a lot of people. 




 Alfred Molina IIRC - Satipo (Indiana Jones), Doc Ock, and some Prince of Persia character  




 Well, that's in terms of box office, not toy, book, and video game sales. 




 I have no idea why you would make a statement that's obviously going to provoke an argument. 




 So we're all neckbeards because we disagree with your opinion, which basically no one else has. 

Logic = A+ 




 I think the conversation was started in the mid-80s, with Gremlins and Temple of Doom. This was tame enough for the time, I guess. 




 Yeah, but not as good as Jaws, unfortunately 




 There was nothing groundbreaking or special about Avatar other than the special effects, which are now commonplace in today's movies. I can't see any Avatar sequels making anywhere near the amount of money that the first one made.

However, Star Wars may be the most popular and successful movie franchise of all time. Like you said, its appeal spans multiple generations all across the globe, and a sequel 10 years in the making is not something that no one cares about. 88 *million* was the number of views that second trailer had in *24 hours*. That's amazing. There is no doubt in my mind that its success will be equal to that of Avatar's. 




 Boring, art house, and foreign all sort of imply pretentious in the context you use it in...

Always loved this scene 




 Guaranteed 1 billion, likely 2, and if it's really really good, I can maybe see it passing Avatar as the highest grossing movie of all time. 




 *The Godfather* - not pretentious or foreign, it is just one of the best written and well told stories.

*Citizen Kane* - most of the cinematography, lighting, makeup, and storytelling techniques you see today? Citizen Kane invented those. 

*The Empire Strikes Back* - nothing pretentious there. Just a good, fun movie. 




 To be honest, there wasn't that much explicitly wrong with it. Sure, the acting was bland and it could be dull at times, but it did its job as a disaster movie. It had the right blend of characters and action. 




 I elaborated on my point. You answered the question saying everyone hates Star Wars when you like it, but that's objectively not true. 




 Well, not really unknown with a few million subs 




 That was Sjin! 




 Think about how much hype that created. No way to see it online easily, and there hadn't been a Star Wars movie in 16 years. 




 No, they're really not. No one hates Star Wars. It's one of the most universally adored and most popular franchises. 




 **The World is Not Enough**

C'mon. It's a cool spy action movie. What's not to love? 




 Well, technically it was produced in Britain with some of their money... So... 




 Eh, more like an SNL sketch, not a feature length movie 




 The Godfather 




 The Elephant Man

Spartacus

The Godfather Part III 




 It was filmed there.

What makes 2001 British? 




 He does use the same quality and techniques for effects 




 I would think that

Kylo Ren = Darth Vader

Snoke = The Emperor

Gleeson's character = Tarkin

Captain Phasma = Boba Fett  




 I would think OP means from the two teasers 




 I think they've confirmed that was pulled from the film - if anyone could back me up on that, that would be great 




 My friends and I played the most intense game of Clue ever. 




 MICHAEL! 




 It just goes to show that, no matter what you say about the quality of those movies, George Lucas new something about marketing 




 - Have seen movie
- Has read book

A few things that make the movie so great in my opinion:

Kubrick's direction

Nicholson's acting

Cinematography

Visuals

Suspense and fear

Though very different from the book, The Shining is a good film on its own 




 Wayne's World. Uh, excellent! 




 Written for the movie... So... 









 I would think "realistic looking computer graphics" fits better 




 Mad Marx: Commie Road

ayy lmao 




 Star Wars, 2001, Jurassic Park, Jaws 




 A few bad names =/= bad story, bad acting, bad directing, or bad visuals. Wait till the movie comes out. He won't ruin it. 




 The freakin' Cha-Cha Slide...

It's a 15 YEAR OLD SONG. How much fun can you have dancing to that after hearing 273 times?? It's the most annoying thing ever created my man. 




 So, average working person = moron? I guess we're all morons then... 




 Like Samsung or Google or Microsoft don't? 




 I wouldn't say horrible quality, Apple does make quality designed hardware and software that works for most average people. 









 Really? This is my favorite one so far  




 He's the man, the man with the Midas touch!!! 




 No, but it would be a more gradual decline to insanity, and I think he can do the whole "intimidating but strangely calm" thing 




 I've always wondered how to see google searches from previous years, thanks! 




 That's why I think Harrison Ford could've worked well in that role 




 Me neither - I think it was only with the IMAX 3D version 




 It might be in IMAX theaters as well 




 Always wondered this. I know there were a countless number of times when Lucas said no, but were there ever rumors in the 2000s of another movie happening?  




 Star Wars - Episode 3: Divisions of the [Quagmire](http://imgur.com/YFRz1l3) 




 The Clone Wars seemed like it could be a title for one of them 




 Yeah, there's really not much about those that couldn't be canon 




 I have 3/5, Droids, Clone Wars Volume 1, and the Ewoks movie. Only the Clone Wars, and maybe Droids, are recommended. 




 I wondered if I should put it on, and I almost left it out, but there are some people out there who seem to like it... 




 Personally I love Last Crusade the best.

What do you think? 




 I honestly don't know how I feel. There were as many good moments for me as there were bad. Firstly, I loved the style overall. It had a very Disney-ish feel to it, which helped to bring a sense of wonder and adventure to it. On the other hand, it was probably one of the most cliche movies I've ever seen, and the dialogue was not anything to be proud of. 




  That's another small step for man, an even greater leap for mankind 




 The Bridge on the River Kwai 




 Haha - I think people are on to you 




 There has never been a time where reading/hearing/seeing Karl hasn't made me laugh out loud 




 Inspired by /u/JG1991's question 




 Yeah, I actually think it's the closest in style and tone to the OT 




 Or the multiple of 2? 




 Then I don't think you understand what makes Star Wars so good and successful. It's a timeless story with relatable characters, something that a lot of movies in the 70s didn't have. Without it's special effects and wide appeal, we wouldn't have any of the blockbuster movies today.  




 C'mon dude! 




 Yeah, I've never understood why that would make it look any better  




 I agree with you on everything except George Miller emulating the style of Buster Keaton. Not in the slightest. Action-comedy is not what I'd call Mad Max. 




 Life, um, finds a way... 




 I think it would be *interesting* (not necessarily good) to see a sequel where all the classic animated characters are struggling in a world where CGI has taken over  




 Use a YouTube to MP3 downloader for the trailer and cut out that one line 




 So you'd rather pay extra for something you can accomplish in an easier way? 




  Iron Man

Comic hero 




  James Bond

Book character 




 Not OP, but I thought it was nothing but a typical action movie. Very little was there in terms of story or dialogue. 




 And it was really only Lucas himself that he saw potential in, not necessarily the movie. 




 :/ 




 I'm sure they would if a popular/critically acclaimed director were to do it - someone like Spielberg or Nolan (not to be circlejerky or anything) 




 Personally, I think those movies have lots of redeeming qualities. Special effects are nice, the whole "world building" is cool, Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson give good performances, and it was interesting to see what was going on in the Star Wars universe before the OT. 




 It already sort of is, and it's only been out for a little more than a week - I don't think there's anything to worry about  




 See:

Conquest of the Planet of the Apes 




 "Sorry, meant to say that" 




 "Yes" 




 Well, you can't call something overrated just because there's parts about it that you don't like... 




 "I really hate the fact that you made me waste the time typing letters into a search engine so I could figure out what you were talking about. I could've used that time to do a lot of other things. I appreciate your comment, but FYI, please try not to ruin my day again."

:/ 




 And Jerry and Elaine and Newman, all rolled up into a neat little package. 




 The weather isn't consistent in every part of Ireland 




 Nice username 




 No offense, but I can tell you from experience that this is not the sub to put text posts with speculation not based on fact  




 But my uncle *does* work for Disney, and his brother in law JJ (Abrams, that is) says the next trailer will be with Inside Out. Also, Palpatine survives and Jar Jar becomes his apprentice 

/s 




 Never seen it actually - the correct answer is Star Wars V 




 You should watch the documentary "Behind the Planet of the Apes" if you haven't seen it  




 No, it was Empire Strikes Back 




 No 




 Nope 




 Nope 




 Got it! 




 Here's 5:

1) ...
2) Planet of the Apes
3) Back to the Future
4) Jurassic Park
5) Jaws 




 Yeah, I figured, but you said *a* Bush, and not just Bush 




 Well, no matter what you say, it has undeniably had a humongous impact on popular culture and filmmaking as a whole. 




 They are still quality pieces of hardware and software
