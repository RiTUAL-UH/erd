 Vicar is a pushover on a level 4 beastbro run, let alone regular character runs.  I think Father G is the only remotely challenging boss out of the first 3 (cleric, father G and Vicar). 




 Ah.  I remember getting there right after I got the cord from Mergo's wet nurse, and before I even had a chance to inspect the item, I went to Gherman and when he said subit, I thought, I didn't come this far for some geriatric mother-fucker to mercy-kill me.  Bam.  On into NG+, and I was sad because I wasn't finished exploring :D 




 Update:  Here is the post I mentioned.  It is based off a lot of solid in-game info, as well as concrete info. from the game guide (that often isn't in the game).  Be warned though:  SPOILERS!


https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/33hj91/yharnam_was_never_the_destination_lore_spoilers/ 




 I'll find the link for you later when I get home. And I said MP because I didn't want to spoil anything for you. What ending did you get? 




 Oooooh. The "up" part was hidden by my phone. That makes more sense, but still, all I can see now is "how to dick your murders." :D 




 Alls I can make out is "how to dick your murders," but something tells me I am reading that wrong :D 




 Yeah. I have yet to see a satisfactory explanation of them, or something beyond a brief mention. The best I heard so far that fit within te known/posited lore, is that they were messengers/servants of the MP. The guy who posted it made enough sense, but at the same time, there might have been discrepancies in what he posted and te time-line of events and characters, as there is clear architecture and statues based off the messengers in the labyrinth, and the chalice dungeons definitely predate the city of Yharnam and the current events.  




 Beast roar can deflect projectiles. Pretty sure nothing else can... 




 I got invaded while I was wielding the BOM, trying em on for size for the previous micolash boss fight, so I tried them out for that duel and I totally got my ass handed to me. Aside not being used to them in general, the range is shit, and their dodge attacks are pretty easy to avoid.  Should have known better since I have yet to die myself to someone using BoM :D 




 I just think 20 vials is too many, for PvE and PvP. The max should be 10 or 12 (aside runes), and they should heal for a bit more. 30 makes te game too easy and encourages sloppy play :/ 




 Yep.  She had quite a few new moves.  Bitch went total ape-shit on me, extending her arms and turning everything black and going clone-slut on me etc. 




 Lots of posts of people confirming that you can, so long as you are in level range as Siam09 mentioned. 




 I think 'true ending' is what the community dubbed it.  The game calls it "childhood ending."  But yeah.  Pretty awesome. 




 I've continued to level my original character up to 200, because he is always swimming in millions of echoes, so I just ran with him to be able to play with all the different items and weapons.  I don't play him that much, because I have more fun with focused builds (that sacrafice one thing for another, instead of total maxed out badass) - and once you learn the game, you can run through it super quick to make more focused, lower level builds for multiplayer.  As a result, I have a level 90 STR, level 90 SKL toon, and a level 90 BT toon, and I plan on rounding it out with an arcane build and a quality build (I enjoy the simplicity and serratedness of the saw weapons) :D


The point is, if you level too high, you are cutting yourself off from the larger meta of more dedicated (for lack of a better word) players. 




 How quickly in game can you turn Ludwig's into an arcane weapon?  Like, what's the earliest arcane gem you can find?  I wanted to make an arcane build, and I heard Ludwig's was one of the best for those.  Also, is Ludwig's better on a quality build?  Thanks. 




 That game is one of the best ever made.  The 'true' ending reminded me of SoC :D 




 Hmmm. At a glance, that seems much quicker. What was that?  10-15 seconds total?  Compared to before, which seemed like 40-45 seconds?  Also. Is that a stock HD?  Or a SSD? 




 Also, what about Laurence?  :D   




 Also, what about the giant "eyes in the sky" in Old Yharnam? 




 Hey Icarus.  Thanks again for your post the other day, and thanks for this write-up as well.  I am pressed for time at the moment, but I have one thing to ask about in the meantime, well, several things but all about the same subject - and that is about the messengers.


I think this is the first post I've seen where someone actually talks more about the messengers, at least, one that fits better with all the other lore that is given or posited.  If they are MP's homeboys, why do we see their likeness in the chalice dungeons?  I mean, it seems the messengers predate MP and Gherman, or was MP always around meddling, and Gherman just came later?  Either way, it is quite murky, but very simply, What does that time-line look like?


Also relevant - I like what you posted about the brain.  I feel like the brain and it's eyeball infection has hardly been touched by the community, especially the people who commonly make lore videos.  That being said, what is your opinion on the brain and it's seemingly spreading corruption?  Who are those iron golems, and why are they seemingly tasked with killing off the baby eyeball brains?  At first glance, I though they were spider eggs, as there were giant spiders nearby, and they looked like milky white egg sacks, but then later you see the brain, and the eyeballs growing on everything, and this leaves me to think that these are baby wintern lanterns/brain trusts that are spreading and growing, but why are the golems killing them?  If the brain was created as a form for the great one to inhabit, or whatever else it could be, why are they killing the babies?  Simply trying to control an experiment that got out of hand?  Because it seems like those eyeballs grow into the brain trusts.  And as for the brain trusts, why is their brain matter made out of messengers?  I don't have the time to re-read this and try to figure out where this stands in your facts/speculation write-up, but how do the messengers fit in with the idea that they are MP's servants/messengers, yet they also make up those brains, including the mother brain?  I suppose they could have been kidnapped by Mensis school and used in the experiments/conjuring then?  Would love to hear your thoughts.  Thanks. 




 Uuuh, what? 




 Right, but from what I've read on here, the vial and consumable system (namely bullets) makes it hard for new players, and it winds up as double frustration for them, because they need to farm vials period, but they aren't that good at the game, so they then use as many as they farm or just die more.  Same thing with insight.  They run out of insight, often on failed summons, and they don't know how to get more, or can't find more.  Etc.  For veteran FROM fans, I think this game was pretty easy to catch the hang of, but for new players, not so much.  Either way though, it all funnels you towards the direction of 'git guud skrub,' but I totally see how it could turn some people off, but my point remains.  10 vials (with the same runes to increase the numbers, I mean, who the fuck needs 24 or 25 vials?) would mean you don't have 20 vials to burn through each time, and thus would hopefully learn to play more carefully and be more cautious.  I think it would be the best balance between the two, and also, make PvP and PvE in general just more exciting and dangerous :D 




 Uhhhh, still nope.  I don't see where Brain Trust comes from :D  I don't think I'm being too dense... 




 I think Blood vials should be limited to 10 or 12 tops, but they should heal for a larger percentage of health.  I feel like once you get the hang of this game, even in chalice 5s and NG++++ and especially for PvP, 20 is just way too many vials, and if anything, I tend to fight and play better the less crutches or healing items I have to lean on.  I feel like having so many just encourages sloppy play, and makes the game too forgiving. 




 Winter lanterns?  I know that comes from the guide, but that just flat out sounds like a print error, typo, or really bad translation...


Also. Where did the name "brain trust" come from in the first place?  :D


Edit:  But yes. Fuck those things.  




 Yeah. Hopefully the patch helps, drastically. Otherwise I do worry about the longevity of this game.its hard for me to understand how FROM really fucked up multiplayer so bad, and the loading screens shouldn't just be brushed aside either. Those are some critical errors for them, and I feel like they should have known better or done better. 


 And I know dark souls 2 was far from perfect, but it was still the best game of 2014, and I'm pretty sure all of us FROM fans had a lot of fun with it and played it more than anything else, which is kind of funny considering how much everyone bitches about it. The point is, B-Team still gets a cookie :) 




 I think that is just the example that some bosses show up as regular enemies sometimes, like undead giants and what not.  




 The thing being the MP's dream is a theory, but yes, we do know Ebrietas is a great one, and we do know the other great ones have form - that I am not denying, but it is important to note where these forms exist, as this game pays great attention to details in where and when characters exist.  Ebrietas is the only one that exists in form in the waking/physical world.  The other great ones have form too, but they exist in their respective realities/dreams/realms (Amygdala in Nightmare frontier, the brain and mhergo in nightmare of mensis, etc).  The implied message about the great ones is that they transcended the limitations of their physical bodies (through force of will, like the hunters learned to dodo), and they can clearly alter and affect reality, and that is the sort of power and knowledge that the characters and institutions in this game have been chasing.  




 I didn't say it was better, and you might be right about that, but there are still some holes to be poked:  the lagstabs and phantom bull-shit has always been a problem with FROM's servers or whatever gerbil-wheel set-up they have going on.


And at least they added the agape ring at pretty much direct requests from players to offset SM in DaS2.  That being said, DaS2 was far less laggy for me than DaS.  DaS had terrible PvP lag for me and imo, and it killed a lot of the fun.  DaS2 was much smoother, and other than hackers, in a zillion games of PvE and PvP, I never had people warping all over the place. 




 Sure. I always enjoy the lore discussions, whether it's someone teahimg me something, or poking holes in someone else's theories. And I always love that the different interpretations only bring up more and more questions :D 




 In general, it's to keep you at a certain level to be able to easily interact with the majority of the community. Most people seem to be stickin between levels 75-120 for both PvE and PvP. It also forced you to actually has to pick and choose your item/magic/weapon usage to make for unique characters and fights. If everyone had 50 in every stat, it would make the game a bit droll as you would be over leveled and over powered, whereas with a level cap, you actually have to make some sacrifices for your build to specialize in certain areas.  




 Ah. Ok. All square here.  




 Fair point :) 




 Yeah. The impressions from the game were that all the great ones weren't necessary one happy pantheon of gods, but that they all had their individual motives an desires, and not all of them were created equal. Thanks for the info. Look forward to hearing what else you might be able to add to it.  




 Dude... the decent damage, the awesome move-set.  The staggers, the range, the sweeps, the knock downs, the long-range R2 followed by a quick R1.... and I just can't put that thing down!  I swear - I tried the rest, but the damage and range of the hammer sucked, and it was way too slow.  Same with the wheel.  Why can't their be any other STR weapon equivelants?!

FOR THE RECORD:  Most of the 2hand damage, and even like, half the 1h damage, comes from blunt damage, not physical.  Check out the post from Icarus with the pictures from the official guide. 




 But if it were to wind up remotely similar, then NO please :D 




 Woohooo!  I see my judas priest reccomendation in there :)

Sad Wings of Destiny was fuckin awesome! 




 Haha. YUP.  Moar coffee and vapes please! 




 Awww, I know the doll says, "I hope you find your worth in the waking world," implying Yharnam and all that, but she is dumb and naive.  I was really hoping Yharnam was a dream of the great ones, and in a sense, we were trying to wake up the great ones, as the world was them retaining their consciousness throuhg force of will, just like Mensis Nightmare and Micolash, Gherman and the hunter's dream, etc.  Their physical bodies are dead and/or gone, but they are still alive on a different plane of existence.  Ok.  This makes it a little less interesting :/ 




 Umm, no, we don't need an alternative to the OP ridiculous bug of the rifle spear (great weapon, the bug aside).  I don't think the Reiter's bullets not scaling with arcane is a mistake.  I think the Rifle Spear's ridiculous damage is a mistake/bug. 




 Actually, I think the doll is just a construct, but due to her coy and aloof nature, she comes off as aloof, almost as if she knows more than she lets on, but in reality she really is quite simple and naive...  fun speculation though :D


Edit:  based on what others with the guide say that the guide says, aside the doll's obvious nature (as she even says she was created by humans, and seemingly is quite simple) 




 Wow.  Crzy to see that my high % +physical gems are nearly useless, or rather, only effective seemingly less than half the time in the axe...  Ok, I'm definately going to have to buy this book! 




 Yeah, it was pretty disturbing when you find mild-mannered Alfred post ape-shit status, covered in gore, and so entrenched in his violence, that he hardly even recognizes or cares to see you, the player character :D 




 I'm fan enough, and I enjoy all things Bloodborne, so I likely will.  Apparently it is hard copy on Amazon for 25 bucks or so?  That sounds like one hell of a deal! 




 Bingo.  He is hiding the rituals from sight, or from being completed.  In turn, Rom is also keeping the cultists/servants from their master (the great one(s) ).  It even says "ritual seal" broken when you kill Rom, which fulfills the note you first see in Yahr Guhl (sp) of "madmen work in madness to bring about more madness rituals," or whatever. 




 Ah ok, so it isn't that he wants the ritual to be completed (via breaking the seal by killing Rom), he wants you to stop the WHOLE ordeal, not just the small portion that Rom is scrambling or blocking?


Edit:  Speaking of which - is there any more info on Rom?  How he got there, or who or what he is?    Or how he became to be the seal that blocks the cultist's rituals?  I firmly believe (ed) that he is not human and never was.


 




 But they're so cute! 




 So, is this from the Bloodborne Collector's Edition Strategy Guide by Future Press?  Thanks. 




 Hmmm, this sort of hints at my thoughts that the brain was indeed a great one (as descibed in game), but he was more or less thought into being somewhere between the other great ones wills, Micolash, the Mensis School, and the age old adage of wanting to "grow eyes on the mind." 




 Dude.  I thoroughly enjoyed your post, but how does anyone play Destiny for more than two or three hours tops?  I mean, I get it, the compulsion to play grindy games often lasts longer than the fun, but the decent graphics and run-of-the-mill yet tight shooter mechanics weren't even remotely redeeming of the fact that it was completely unimaginative, generic, had no intrigueing characters or plot points, the voice acting was terrible, it had mediocre gameplay, and by mission 2 or 3, they were already recycling the same maps...


Ahem.  Sorry, I just really hate that game and how shitty it was, and how everyone rushed out to buy such a polished hype-turd.  And to this  day, I'm still baffled that anyone can stomach it :D 




 Punished for failing to learn?  But that is how life is, and how it should be, and it is a shame there are so many stupid people out there not being punished as much as they probably deserve.  But it is such a great parallel to existense itself - art imitating life really :D 




 I use the opposite strategy to avoid her, be it in NG+++, or chalice dungeons.  If I lock on her, I can't see when to start running to avoid the one-shot lasers, as trying to roll or dodge stops me for a split second, and I get zapped.  I know they make noises, but I'm usually too stressed to  figure that out in those moments.  I've subsequently locked her down to where I can kill her in one attempt every time, even on new characters, but man oh man, trying not to die in that last phase the first time fighting her was brutal  




 Yes.  There are a lot of gaps to fill, but so far, it would seem that we don't even know what the real world is anymore.  The only way to wake up the moon presence is by our will becoming powerful enough that we can retain consciousness upon death (the way gherman, micolash, and the other great ones do, even after permanent death of the body), and the only way we can do this is by killing Gherman himself, and this only results in slavery to the MP because we do not have the insight to know that the MP is is there orchestrating this blood-orgy and fucking with us.  After having the necessary insight through the umbilical cords themselves (seemingly the blue-print of evolution and the 'how to' of becoming a great one') we begin to see through the dreams, and then we finally arise to front and center stage of the brutal shit-show of the MP's nightmare realm, and we get the MP's attention.  The MP still wants to make us a thrall to his will and his dream, but we say, *"not today bitch, we know better,"* and when we finally kill it, we become the new Chief Asshole and somehow usher humanity forward into a new age of it's Baby Squid-Monster Overlord...
 




 It still wound up making quicker and easier multiplayer connections, be it for PvE or PvP :/ 




 Gotcha.  Thanks.  Did some more reading up on the original post and the updates and comments and I see what they mean.  Hopefully these odds and ends get fixed sooner rather than later. 




 Gotcha.  I remember seeing the original post a few days ago.  Just read up on the updates and the comments, and I see what you guys mean now.  Thanks Atrophy and Vividos. 




 Dude.  I loved the rifle spear in PvE (talking regular use, not arcane exploit), even though the damage was relatively weak for the first half of the game.  The weapon is fun, and it comes with a lot of reach and versatility.  The build I was using it on was switched to BT (I was just using the rifle-spear cuz I hated the cane), and I was hoping to make a dedicated PvE/PvP rifle spear build just because it was one of the most fun weapons I've played with, but I suppose I'd rather wait till this arcane rifle spear stuff blows over as well :/ 




 I don't believe MP and Oedeon are one in the same myself, but see my above post, as we technically don't see the MP in the "physical world" either (if one even exists in game).  We only encounter the MP in Gherman's dream, and I believe the rest of the game is the MP's dream, hence we are trying to transcend it by waking it up, and refusing to become its thrall. 




 Not that the MP is clearly defined, but Odeon is more clearly defined, as he is described as the formless Great One who exists only in thoughts or words or whatever, which is where the Caryll runes come from.  The MP clearly has a physical form, though we only see it in Gherman's dream, which might mean it has no physical form either, as it supports the idea that the Great One's ascencion is them leaving there physical bodies behind, which is supported by the fact that Ebrietas, the great one that was explicitly described as "being left behind" and "abandoned," is the only one we see in the waking or physical world, which might be a great one's dream in the first place, because the whole game is a series of character's wills forcing them to retain their consciousness, ie., Gherman's Dream, Micolash's dreams (whose dead body we actually see after The One Reborn) and so forth, and it seems our character's true mission is to wake the great ones from their dreams, so we can transcend it.  I believe the waking world (as the Doll implies) is the MP's (a great one's) dream, and I do not believe him and Oedeon are one in the same.  Oedeon is just one of the former great ones that has ascended and left the physical realms behind, and has never been seen in a dream, be it his or someone else's. 




 How do we know that you're not supposed to be able to?  Does arcane not apply to the reittersplash then?  And accidentally apply to the rifle spear?  Thanks. 




 Dude.  I missed the charred set on my first toon my first time around, But I absolutely fucking love the full charred armor set with the top hat!   




 Well, it partially summons her, as in, it shoots out her tentacles.  Other in-game item descriptions relating to the choir tell us Ebrietas was a great one that was left behind.  It seems they use strong language either way in saying "abandoned" and "left behind."  Maybe she wasn't strong enough to transcend her physical body like the other great ones seemingly did? 




 Oedeon:  *"Should we bring Ebrietas with us when we leave?"*


Moon Presence:  *"Shhhhhh!  No dude!  She stands like, right in your face when she speaks to you.  Seriously, doesn't she have any concept of personal space?  Let's just leave her behind."* 




 Item descriptions say she is a great one, and that she "was left behind."  My guess based off lore is that the great ones were able to transcend their physical bodies (in the same way in-game items tell us hunters can retain their consciousness through sheer force of will, ie., like gherman and his dream, or dead micolash and him as host of the nightmare).  The schools and church and players in game are trying to transcend the physical world it seems, transcend the realites in front of them, and it seems the hunter exists in gherman's dream, and he is trying to wake the current great one (the moon prescence) up from its dream... but it all only brings up more questions. 




 But between the choir garb and other in-game item descriptions, the game flat out tells us that Ebrietas is indeed a Great One, and that she was left behind, left-behind being the real question as to what it means.  Did the other ones ascend?  They seem to not exist in the physical realm, and only exist in mind and dreams and other realms of existence.  Why was Ebrietas left behind?  Etc? 




 How is it that it winds up so kerplow-powerful?  The flat arcane damage gets applied to each pellet and is thus more powered than a % gem could make it?  I loved playing with the rifle spear (regular gem slots, didn't know how OP it could be) in the PvE game on my skill build (since I hated the cane) until I went for Evylyn/Chikage.  I wanted to make a build around the weapon because it was so much fun, though the damage was a bit lacking - but I don't want to make a build around this since it will likely be patched out..  




 Is it really a glitch though?  I just thought it was OP mechanics the way the arcane rifle spear turns out? 




 Welcome to Camera Souls, where the hardest enemy you will ever fight is ultimately, THE CAMERA!


YOU DIED! 




 The brain is a great one that was found/created in the nightmare (see the description of living string item). The first eyeball growths you see are dead and covered in a milky white film, hence I said I and others mistook them for spider eggs, especially with the appendages that look like they are coming out of eggs. Later, in the area of mother brain, you can clearly see they are eyeballs growing on everything, which is seemingly what happens if it is left unchecked. The question is, what are they, why are they growing, and who are the little iron golems and why are they seemingly trying to poke out all the eyeballs? 




 Mother Brain and her scourge of eyeballs that are over-running the Nightmare of Mensis.  The first time through that area, we see those pale, milky white sacks covering various parts of the level and the mansion where Micolash resides.  At a glance, I thought they were spider eggs, after all, there seem to be legs growing out of many of them, and there is a giant spider and her spiderlings nearby.  It all seemed simple enough.  From there, you observe the little iron golem men in the mansion strolling around, as if they are tasked to destroy these eggs, since the eggs have arrows/spikes jabbed through them.  It isn't until you find the hidden area with Mother Brain that you see that they aren't innocuous little sacks of spider eggs, but actual eyeballs, as if the brain is replicating, or spreading some sort of disease or curse or who knows what.  Those are the obvious ideas behind it (the mother brain spreading her rottenness), but I was curious what other people's ideas and opinions and speculations were about this area and how it relates to Mother Brain, the iron golems, and the spreading eyeball scourge.  It's almost like the opposite of much of the rest of the game, where the characters and enemies willingly blindfold or blind themselves to keep from seeing what is before them.  I look forward to your replies.  Thanks. 




 They don't scale.  Sure, the first crows you meet in game don't have as many HP as the same crow enemies later on in the game, but they are just adjusted to general game progression.  They don't slide along with your direct leveling/gameplay. 




 Dude.  Charred Hunter's set is pimp!  So much Heavy-Metal-Dracula-Bad-Ass hunter goodness.  Looks great with the Top Hat, and so many other things! 




 Great One***, not Old One  :D
 




 You are new to the Souls games huh?  Yes.  You are doing exactly what you need to be doing, and you are exactly where you need to be.  Do not look up spoilers or info or help.  Slug it out and play blind through one of video gaming's most unique experiences :D 




 For pretty much the entire game, including the weak ass final (or near final) boss :D 




 I think this game was the easiest, because a lot of us players knew what to look for and expect from a FROM game.  Once upon a time, stumbling upon a black knight as a newb in Dark Souls got you wreckt, but now you can go fight it no problem, or even beat the game as a onebro.  Remember, this game and its mechanics and brutality are new to a lot of people.  Sure, even for longer term Souls players it takes some time to learn the new combat system, but once you get that down, it is essentially more of the same.  Try to imagine playing DeS or DaS or BB for the first time, or as your first FROM game.  That being said, I agree.  The Chikage hunter in the Grand Cathedral is harder than pretty much all the bosses in the game. 




 That was all speculation and hype. 




 I think they should have just kept the tried and true summoning sign method, and to keep with the theme, instead of little runic signs via soapstones, it could have just been your messengers sitting there, rining the bells for you. 




 Traded in DaS1 and 2?  I get it, the games aren't for everyone.  Go play CoD  :P 




 TIL That everyone hates the books they were forced to read in high school.  That, and a lot of people don't understand literature, or its significance in history...  Not everyone is meant to or likes to read.  Go back to watching TV.   There are a lot of ignorant people here.  BRING ON THE DOWN VOTES! :D 




 A lot of people had mentioned it and continue to mention it, but it was far more original and it pushed the bar for its time, though other authors who remain unpopular or unheard of had done it better decades before Salinger, so yeah, fuck that book, but hey, it set the bar for generations of self-absorbed navel-gazers to come! 




 But it set the bar for generations of self-absorbed navel-gazers to follow!  It's like, the thing to do! 




 Longer reply:  I didn't mean to dismiss micolash'd blatherings, since as you said, insight is madness in this game, but another key thing he says is "the lake is mud," or something like that, implying how Rom hides or hinders the rituals the church is trying to work, hence he has the title vacuous. It answers the question of why Wilhem hid him  - Rom is there to be a scrambler to the church. Something about him/her/it hides/hinders the church's workings. The church knows Wilhem is at odds with them, and they sent a hunter in choir garb to keep watch on him - hunter who even uses the auger of Ebriatis, the great one that was left behind, the great one the church found, and the only great one that actually exists in the physical (or dreaming or waking?) world. 


Also. Every other human in bloodborne gets a lot of screen time, dialogue, or descriptions in the game via items or notes, yet there is none at all tht mention rom except those that reference te bergynwyrth spider. I don't believe this is incidental, accidental, or intentional. There is no mention of Rom the human, because he never was human.  The implication is that rom is somehow kin (yes, great one blood is an item in game, and we get none from rom), and an interpretation of what Micolash says is akin to Jenny in forest gump, when she says, "dear god, make me as a bird so I can fly far away."  She doesn't actually expect to be turned into a bird, or that birds were other entries that were just one day slapped with the gift of wings. She just wants their ability. There is no concrete evidence in what Micolash says to make it truly lean one way or the other, but based on all the evidence in game, and the fact that Rom the human is never mentioned, I happen to believe Micolash just meant what he said about rom as, "I want what he has."  Nothing more, nothing less. 


And still, this only brings up more questions of "who, what, when and why?"  Your thoughts?   :) 




 Quick reply: I thought the same thing, until I found "great one blood" in a chalice dungeon, and thought, 'holy shit. That's a big difference'. Worth noting, great one blood (at least in coldblood form) is not pale. 


Will read and write more later.  




 And this hiding keeps it from coming to fruition by blocking people's perceptions?  Hence the title vacuous? 




 Dude. I hated the blunderbuss too. It seemed do much more clunky and harder to use than pistols :/ 




 I thought vacuous was somehow relate to how Rom is sort of like a signal scrambler, somehow keeping the cultist's rituals from working. He ce, once you kill him, the ritual in the unseen village is completed successfully, everyone is killed and the one reborn is...reborn. This is supported by the notes, "the spider keeps all manner if rituals from us."  As well as, "The Byrgynwyrth spider keeps our master from us."  The spider is rom, and the master is the one reborn or the kin or the great ones themselves or whatever, not Wilhem as a lot of people presume. This could furthermore support the Wilhem being at direct odds with te churh, hence e summoned Rom, though a lot of the details are still missing. 


Worth noting, a lot of people think Rom was a person turned into a weird creature, but there is nothing in game at all to support this. I think Rom is kin, he ce we get kin blood and not great one blood from him. People like to reference micolash'd dialogue, but that is the ranting of a madman, and saying "give us eyes as you have Rom," doesn't mean Rom was born as a human and later gifted with eyes. It can just as well mean he was simply born/created that way, and Micolash says "give us eyes like rom" just like a child might say "I want wings like the birds so I can fly"


There's another idea I have that I have yet to see be discussed - and that is the brain that is covered in eyes, which in game it is directly called a great one, and the point is, with all the lines between humanity and our base nature and dreams and reality being blurred, was the brain found?  Or was it forged through the yearnings and experiments of mensis and wilhem's sayings "line our brains with eyes."  Very simply, was the brain basically "thought" into existence through the nightmare, the great ones, and the wills of those working on te crazy experiments? 




 Not all the chalice merchants are. I remember one or some of the others in a dead end room that was an offshoot of one of the paths.  




 Right. And it took me awhile to figure those tougher enemies out. I honestly think FROM put them there to crush the player and their spirit, because new players just cant or wont stan a chance asindt them, andeven with good equipment those enemies can own you if you underestimate them, but I think they are there so that when you come back to kill them, you can really see how much better you have become as a player :D 




 I got ya though.  Like Hellkite drake?  Or black Knights?  I mean, even then, Hellkite drake was definitely not meant to be killed right away, and Onebro stuff is when you have already become pro enough at the game and you need a challenge, but you're absolutely right.  There are no real "HOLY SHIT" moments of, *'that guy fucking stomped me, and I would have never in a million years beat him my first go or anywhere near it.'*  


But, aren't you looking at this from the perspective of a vetted FROM fan?  What about the people new to the series who took days or weeks to kill the first two bosses?  I bet those executioner's were about as hard as black knights were back in the day, wouldn't you think?


I mean, we've also come to expect this from them, so I think the player base has just gotten better at playing FROM's games as well, and they know what to expect, and it is hard to recapture those previous moments of "holy jebus who was that that just stomped me!?" 




 You know, big poisonous blood monsters that make you sick? 




 Judas Priest - The Ripper 




 Pendant in its usefulness, but I think iris there to cement the lore. The whole the great ones and hunters and etc can retain their consciousness trough force of will, even if there bodies are dead.  




 You know that's not the Blood Letting Beast that everyone complains about as hard, right?  :P 




 What a bunch of assholes.  Tell them to go play CoD if they are going to complain about what has been an excellent staple since the beginning of FROM's game design.  It adds a nice touch of needed variety and excitement and exploration.  I'd love to see more Sen's fortresses and Cainhurst's and traps and AIDS monsters! 




 Yeah.  The worst part of Cainhurst is how short it is, though the excellent level design in general of BB really hides how short and linear the game actually is :/ 




 What was your poison resist at?  My level 4 bro couldn't do the last phase of that fight without getting herpes, cuz that fucker just looks at me and BAM, I get bloodbeast AIDS and my HP starts dropping like dead hookers in my basement, and I gotta use an antidote cuz that shit is super powerful.  Even with chucking molotovs and blood lure potions, that fucker still moves to fast and is on me giving me the beast herp before I can even tap the dodge button. 




 "Oh look (Gherman), you found yourself a (another) hunter."


"May you find your worth in the waking (dreaming) world." 




 Haha.  At first I thought, "Look, those crows think they are dogs!" and later I was all like, "Holy shit, those dogs fucked those crows!"


That, and I thought it was some sort of bad Japanese to English transition, like, somehow, Miyazaki thought crows barked in English speaking countries :D 




 Why would anyone use a cannon for PvE?  I mean, other guns and weapons are far more versatile and useful, and they don't take such a large stat investment and use half of a precious resource in one shot :D


My only suggestion is using pistol for parry and visceral ing him to death. You just need the patience and the practice. I haven't gotten to him yet on my level 4 beast bro, but the plan is to parry+charge or strong attack, since level 4 viscerals don't do shit for damage.  




 Lots of lower tier rune, 2 blood stone chunks, and a lot of other bloodstone upgrades.  Coming here ASAP was indispensable for my level 4 beastbro  :D 




 For low stat characters?  Yes, for sure.  Beastbro uses an axe though, because I hate the cane, and the axe is badass and has an indispensalbe moveset and good crowd control.  I just use the % ones for now, because I have never really seen a worthwhile flat damage gem outside of a chalice dungeon IIRC  :D 




 I've gotten quite a few at random off rats, but why do you need to farm for them?  In following standard dungeon progression, and thoroughly exploring those and the later root chalices you create for loot, you should have more than enough crafting materials to make a few top tier dungeons at any given time. 




 You can run in tighter circles though and make it proc quicker, so yes, it is faster to a point.  Or you can walk around the table and have it proc once on each side, or run it in a tight circle and get it to proc quicker. 




 My guess is they are as close as it gets to "raw" upgrades in previous souls games, whereas, a nice flat damage bonus to a weapon would be worth more to a low stat character than a +%scaling weapon.

For example, my Level 4 beastbro would probably get more out of a gem with a flat 20-40 damage, rather than +15-20%, since his STR and SKL are like, 8 or 9 each, though, I haven't gotten any worthwhile flat damage gems yet in game to compare the differnces, as the really good ones are hard to get.
