 There's literally no actual evidence of that. 




 Yeah, he didn't.... my other co-workers recommended that I stopped giving him rides since, well first - he lives very far and he's a pretty ungrateful guy.

I gotta learn to start saying no to people without having a guilty conscience. I'll try to learn from this expensive lesson.

Thank you.

 ...and it's taken her 5 years to do that? Pretty sure the Disney image went away as soon as she took that first bong hit of Salvia and shaved her head. 




 Am I a bad person? 




 Yeah, I agree. Would it make any sense to ask for the gas money that he bailed out on giving repeatedly in the past?  




 17 over. Is it worth mentioning that he lived 25 minutes away? 




 Well, he was pretty far from my current location at the time.  His work place was near where I was and he lived 25 minutes away. So going the limit would take 50 minutes to get him to work which he would then have to change out and what not which would make him late. I think that's worth mentioning. 




 So, I was in the middle of an errand when my friend texted me saying he needed a ride to work. Finished my errand at 10:10 and he has to clock in at work at 11:00 so I immediately drove to his house. He told me to step on it so he won't be late and, stupidly, I did and I ended up getting a speeding ticket. I figured he would be understanding and feel bad and offer to help me out when I got to his house and told him (Stupid me) but he just shook it off and practically said, "tough luck, bud." What pissed me off the most was right after, he had the audacity to tell me to hurry so he won't be late. Ended up getting to him to work in time.


Ticket came home to be $367 and I'm falling very short as I just paid for my classes for next semester.
tl;dr:


-Friend Asked for a Ride to Work, I agreed


-He told me to step on it, I got a speeding ticket


-He had the audacity to tell me to hurry RIGHT AFTER I got a ticket so he wouldn't be late to work. Also, he didn't even pay for gas...


-Got him to work on time at the cost of $367.


-Would it be okay for me to ask him to help pay for it? If so, what should I say? 




 I was just trying to help him out and I paid the consequences for doing so. I know. I'm not saying it's not my fault. 




 50 MPH, I was going 17 over.

My friend also lives 25 minutes away from where I was at the time and it would've taken us the same amount of time to get to his workplace.

 




 Yeah, you're right. I guess I just felt rushed at the moment and didn't want him to get in trouble at work. I'm not saying it's not my fault, though. 




 It wouldn't be reasonable at all? :/

And I was just trying to help him the entire time. 




 Doing some community service early in the morning. 




 Even if you specifically told them to step on it? 




 I'm not asking him to pay for all of it.  But he skipped out on giving me gas money for giving him rides several times in the midst of my own schedule and it would be *very nice* of him to chip in to some degree.

 Anyone else also think it's bullshit they killed off Sara in the first episode?

 Does anyone else feel like this is the easy way out? Kind of clich. 

I want a twist. 




 Hey, /r/advice, I was really hoping you guys could help me out. I've been stressed out lately trying to deal with my mother.


Let me give some background info before jumping into it, first. I'm an 18 year guy and until recently have never had a girlfriend or anything close. In High School I was kind of shy and socially awkward when it came to talking to girls. It doesn't help that my parents come from a foreign country and how they think that "getting good grades in class" equates to getting girls to like me. So... yeah.


Anyways, I decided to make a change ever since I started college last fall. I've acted more confident, got a job, started making new friends and talking to girls. Oh yeah, I've never really had many close friends. Never hung out with anyone much because I wanted to avoid having anyone over in fear of my mom's awkwardness. (I brought one friend, who was a guy, over one time and she kept peeking in for whatever reason all awkwardly when we were hanging out in the living room)


So yeah. Lately, I've been bringing friends over to the house to study and hang out afterwards - usually in my room but sometimes on the dinner table too if we both need extra space for our assignments, books, and what not. Surprisingly, my parents were cool with it. They haven't barged in or anything like that or bothered us at all. It's like I'm having a social life for the first time in my life and, to be honest, I really like it. I've spent most of my teenage years shut in my room and browsing the internet and it's been kind of lonely to be honest.
So, I don't know how it happened but I somehow convinced a girl to give me a chance to take her out for a date. We had a great time and I've been seeing her a lot lately. Never really talked to my parents about her but we've been going out on dates frequently and, honestly, I like her a lot.


About two weeks while we were hanging out after classes - we were talking about the new Furious 7 movie, I talked about asking her to come over to watch a Fast   Furious marathon with me before we go see the movie in theaters together. She said she'd be down to come over right then since she didn't have plans for the rest of the day. I texted my parents I was having a friend over and when she came over I introduced her to them. Afterwards I took her to my room and set up the movie and I left to use the restroom. When I got back I noticed my mom talking to her and then left right before I got back to my room. I asked her what my mom said and she said that my mom asked if we wanted to hang out in the living room. In my head I'm like, "what the heck, mom?" Way to put her on the spot.


So during the first movie, my mom knocked on the door and told me it wasn't good for my friend to be over this late and I told her that my friend's own mother was fine with it since she (my friend) told her parents before she decided to swing by.


Anyways, we went through the first movie and got halfway through the second before one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. Afterward, I checked the time and it was still pretty early (About 8:30ish) and I took her home so my parents wouldn't complain and so her own parents wouldn't worry. My friend's mom was really impressed I cared about her that much.


Next morning I have a talk with my mom about last night and, surprisingly, she acted very calm about it. She said everything that I'm doing is perfectly normal for an 18 year old (btw my mom's a nurse) and she just pointed out to make sure we were having protected sex if we decided to do it. Awesome, right?


A couple days later after I brought her over again to study and hangout. Of course, I told my parents before doing so. She came over and we were hanging out in the living room with the movie on and me doing my assignment. After awhile I finished my assignment and noticed how uncomfortable she looked - just hanging out on the floor. I asked her if she just wanted to go hang out in my room since she looked like she was having trouble getting comfortable by lying in a bunch of weird positions lol. So we went back to my room and just watched the movie there. About 15 minutes in I get a call from my dad saying that mom wants to talk to me so I excuse myself and go over to my parents room and my mom was absolutely furious that I took her back to my room?


She was mad that I told her we were going to study and went to my room but... I told my mom I finished the assignment. Also, it's not like we couldn't study inside my room, right? Anyways she threw a fit and demanded she get out of my room so I decided to just leave the house with my friend... When I got back - my mom was arguing with my dad about the whole situation.


Since then I've only been allowed to bring her over if we go to the living room and even when I do my mom is extremely irritated about it. Last time I brought her over, when we walked through the front doors - my friend greeted my mom and my mom just pointed to the living room while saying, "I know what's best for you (my name here)."


It's been like this ever since and it's destroying my relationship with this girl. I don't like bringing her over anymore because there's an awkward tension in the household and it sucks because I can't go over to her house either (for temporary reasons I shouldn't disclose). Because of this when we do hang out we usually go out to eat which sucks because we have to spend money over and over if we want a nice indoors place to see each other.


I've had several male friends over since to study for finals with and my parents haven't said anything but my mom freaks out and throws a huge fit which irritates the hell out of my dad because she will bitch at him for not being able to "control his son."


So, finally I had enough and confronted my mom about this and asked her why it was okay for me to bring guys into my room yet I can't bring a girl into my room. I explained that I thought it was because my mom believed we would be constantly having sex. I also pointed out that, like I said earlier, my mother was fine with that. Anyways... my mom just wouldn't give me a reason other than "I know what's best for you." She also pointed out that she hates me having people over. (Which is clearly a lie because she never says anything when guys are over) So yeah, no explanation - no nothing.


Please help me. I've had a taste of what having a social life felt like and it was great. I don't want my mother to ruin this for me.

 Hey, /r/legaladvice, I'm in a predicament right now and I was hoping you guys could help. I got a speeding ticket a month ago and I got the okay to do traffic school and work the point off my record. Unfortunately, I just got in another one today (got peer-pressured into going fast to give my friend a lift to work). I told the officer my situation and he seemed considerate   offered to ask for a reduction for me. Unfortunately, I still got a ticket.


However, I explained the fact that I hadn't yet done my traffic school yet for the first ticket and I'm still within the 60 day deadline (or so, it ends on the 22nd of May). He told me that I should try to *"cheat the system"* and though I'm *"not supposed"* (he kept repeating it) to, he recommended that I put traffic school for the first ticket on hold  , since I don't yet have the "traffic school completion" on my record yet, that I should request traffic school again since the 18 month delay between traffic school eligibility hasn't been set.


There's no guarantee it'd work, but he says if it does that I could potentially get both points off my record. The whole thing seems sketchy to me but I figured the most I could lose out of it was 1 point and the most I could benefit by trying is having no points at all.
Also, the officer offered to ask for a reduction for me when I show up to court but I was planning on showing up earlier than the deadline date so I could still request traffic school - and if happen to get it, I could finish both before the deadline for my first traffic school ticket expires. I'm not sure how that would work though, would I have to contact him to let him know ahead? I got his name on my ticket but I believe that was about it.


Honestly, I'm more worried about the points though.


Hopefully, that wasn't at all confusing   you guys could offer some advice. Thanks a lot, guys :)


One last thing, what I've learned out of this is that you have to weigh the pros and cons of speeding. If speeding a couple minutes off getting to your destination is worth a couple hundred dollars in tickets and a thousand in insurance bumps is worth it - than by all means, go ahead. But, more than likely, most of the time you're better off going the limit and driving safe. For me, I should've done the latter for both situations.

Also... I just don't understand why he'd offer me to advice on how to cheat the system after giving me a ticket.  Quotas?  




 Can you get any money from this? 




 Do they not lock the doors while the Flash is hanging about? 




 Someone should make Mayweather read this. 




 So I didn't have time to comment earlier but after reviewing your video again I think you definitely deserve a lot more.  In my opinion, you displayed much more technical skill than your opponent.  As someone who has also had experience fighting against higher belts that're much bigger, this trait is a necessity in order to win as you must outsmart/skill your opponent to make up for any size/strength disadvantages. 

 You have great technique when it came to your Tornado Kicks, but like I said earlier - you must focus on baiting your opponent out in order for a kick like that to land, especially a kick like that.  Offensive Spinning Kicks have a much lower accuracy than counter-offensive.  Improving your footwork will also help you bait out your opponent.  

You took a lot more valid hits than he did - not because he's necessarily better, but you took some illegal hits earlier which affected your game and that you seemed to be waiting for an opening. 

Watch the boundaries, try not to step out of the mat.  Impose your will over your opponent rather than the other way around so if he pushes forward, you push right back with a forward attack or a counter instead of just backing up.  You want to be more dominant than he is.  

With all that said, I just want to commend you for a great first fight and I encourage you to keep training hard and compete.  I see your spirit in the ring and if you keep at it - you will be great.  Thank you for sharing your experience with us. :) 




 Great Spin Kicks.  Work on baiting and you'll be landing and scoring those more often. 




 Plot Twist: That guy kicks as hard as Superman. 




 Thank you based god.

 The Hangover Part 2. 









 He's so fake. 




 A "good" cop tells, for lack of a better word, on a "bad" cop and all of the other bad cops can intimidate that cop and his family. 

That's what happened to Jim Gordon in Batman: Year One.  Jim Gordon was one of the few good cops in a corrupt department and he was ambushed and beat up for trying to do the right thing.  The corrupt officers also threatened his pregnant wife.

EDIT: This is the reason why we need a Batman.

 Thank you for the explanation. 




 So what would a Spinning Back Kick be described as in Karate? 




 We should ask Chris Weidman for lessons on checking leg kicks. 




 That was a Spinning Hook Kick.

I don't understand why people mix these kicks up.  A Back Kick travels in a straight line.  It's like confusing a cross with a hook.

i don't understand. can someone explain? 




 This was posted a week ago. 




 Could it be useful or is it too slow/situational/etc.? 









 ok, assume we whack a hammer on my hand vs lay something on it that has the same lbs as a hammer after calculating the force of the swing with the weight of the hammer. Would it both feel the same?  




 Nah, not consistent. Amazing Spider-Man 2 was so trash that they're going to reboot the series a third time. 




 Thank you for the explanation and the example. 




 But "lbs of force" as a force unit and "lbs" as a unit of mass can be equal if they both weigh in at the same number, right? 




 If someone can kick at "3,000 lbs of force" would that be the same as saying their kick weighs in at 3,000 lbs? 




 Early 2000's? Spider-Man was pretty good. 




 DAE hate when they get a cart that won't steer straight and keeps moving to the left/right? 




 The dumb character design for the Robin girl killed it for me along with the whole generic Mutant Gang.  But yeah, I agree the story is good but the actual details were lacking imo.  Hopefully Dawn of Justice is a lot more entertaining and draws me into the story.

 He wore the mech suit throughout the story?

Which book? 









 Will he be wearing the mech suit throughout the movie? I prefer the classic Batman costume. 

I'm guessing the mech suit is just to fight Superman?

 lol its slanted 




 thats racist. 




 what's that mean? 




 Uhm... Karate, Judo, BJJ, and JJJ also wear a Gi to fight in competition. 




 Grant Gustin seems a bit shorter than Stephen Amell.  However, imbd lists Gustin as an inch taller than Amell. 




  It drove him insane when he found out he was fated to become his arch nemesis

I mean, with that knowledge he could've just rationally altered history by making his decision to *not* become the Flash's arch nemesis. 




 It's traditional to wear the White, formal "Gi/Dobok" to fight in competition. 




 American Karate: Rednecks.

Damn. This has gotta be the most honest statement in all of /r/martialarts. 




 Karate Gi's and Taekwondo Doboks, compared to Judo/JJJ/BJJ Gi's, are made of thin material for a good "snap" sound whenever you punch or kick.  Because of this, if you try to grapple with them - they'll tear.

Judo/JJJ/BJJ Gi's are designed to take a beating with them being pulled and tugged for throws, submissions and what not so therefore, they are weaved much thicker than Karate/Taekwondo/Etc. Uniforms.

EDIT: One's heavy and the other is light. 




 You realize Gi's for Grappling Arts and Gi's for Striking Arts are different right? 




 DUDE.  It costs **a dollar** and it can save your **life.** 




 Where can I read this at? 




 Honestly, this.  What the fuck. 




 The Chest Gear is how they score points.  It's electronic.  




 I meant why are they wearing Gi's when it's not a grappling sport?


Why do Karate guys wear Gi's when it's not a grappling sport? 




 As of 2015:

Kicks/Punches to the Body = 1 Point

Spinning Kicks to the Body = 3 Points

Kicks to the Head = 3 Points

Spinning Kicks to the Head = 4 Points 




 It's full-contact sparring, actually.
