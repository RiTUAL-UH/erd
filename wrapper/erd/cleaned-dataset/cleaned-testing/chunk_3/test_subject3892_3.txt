 Couldn't agree more with this. So many so-called authors out there try to use the ebook space as a quick-money scheme. Guys like JA Konrath pump out garbage left and right and take the full royalty from Amazon. I'd actually like to see now just how loyal that presumed fan base really is. It may hurt the writer, but it protects the reader as well. 

Of course, Amazon could also REFUND based on how much you don't read, but I guess that won't be happening.  




 Is it the re-published, un-edited version, or the one the publisher put on shelves before King decided to reprint them in the spirit in which they were intended?

Coming from someone who read the unedited, 1000+ page version, it's only slow because you can just tell which parts were left on the cutting room floor. But I do agree with the overall sentiment here - stick with it. It's definitely my favorite of his.  




 Well it's important to note it's purple. You know, because we don't need the color blind guy at the range complimenting OP on his nice "gray" bow.  




 I kind of wonder a lot of the things you ask as well whenever I think of Bukowski. Was he someone that generation could relate to better than ours? What exactly about his style has cemented it in the legacy of writing? And to that point, what style does he even fall under?

I never really found him to be funny. If anything, he portrayed himself as the heroic anti-hero. And by that I mean, he knew he was a horrible person but by virtue of embracing it and pretending to not care what people thing, he believed it ultimately made him cool in the eyes of the reader.

I've never read Ham on Rye, but I've read his Tales of Ordinary Madness and Women. Both were awful. To be honest, I feel one picked up where the other left off. And it doesn't even matter which order you read them in. They're all basically about the same thing: Misogyny, alcohol, drugs, sex, horse racing, fighting, more drugs, more women, more sex, a crappy car, cigarettes, bowel movements, more alcohol, sex again, the occasional note about writing something, alcohol, sleep, a hot bath, and the list goes on. 

I don't know why, but I keep trying to find something of his worth my time. I just can't seem to find THAT story yet. At this point, if the works I've read are any indication, I doubt I will.  




 Karim Mayfield is looking to hit the Chris Algieri lottery. Hope his acting skills are up to the task.  




 And therein lies the issue with magazines. Less people buy them, companies still feel the need to make em, so they jack up the price.  




 Hot off the grill in 8 - 10 minutes? Fast food isn't fast anymore.  




 No way he wants to fight GGG. No one wants to fight him, let alone a 42 YO retiree looking to make a return after seven years out of the game. Training or not, there's no way he gets back on the map soon enough, especially at a caliber high enough to face Golovkin. 




 Well OK then. Carry on.  




 Ay, go easy on him. It's not pink. Or even bright purple for that matter. I dig it, actually. Nice one, OP.  




 Not entirely sure if I should be insulted or not by your suggestion to take on something that is dumbed down... 




 To be honest, I don't think that was even an option on the Kindle I had at the time. And even if it was, my attempts at paperback proved futile as well.  




 OK, I know I'm taking a big risk saying this but, Game of Thrones. The very first book. I tried it on the Kindle and determined halfway through that it would be best read as a paperback since it likely required a lot of flipping back and forth to remind myself who some of the characters are.

Then I tried reading it in paperback and similarly struggled. Just wayyy too many names, places...things. I tried, I failed, and I'm sure I'll try again at some point.  




 I agree with Eogris's comment below - Just embrace the chaos of it. The plot line is centered on insanity. It's not supposed to make sense to anyone (which is more or less what a Catch-22 is).  




 I'm with ya. Tried it twice over the span of three years. Just couldn't do it.  




 **Pirates Latitudes, Michael Crichton**

It's been sitting on my shelf for a while, so no better time than now. This is also my personal double shot of Crichton, as I just started and finished The Great Train Robbery last week.  




 I guess you could say Burroughs is a little dark and depressing in his style, right? I'm basing off only two books thiugh, but he comes from a different place. Sedaris finds the humor in the awful stuff and leaves you laughing at his unfortunate circumstances. He's a satirist in its purest form. 




 Yeahhhhh the cold calling thing was a bit annoying. Also, what luck to have plucked them out of the group of similar names so quickly, huh? I guess it is the job of a journalist and all, but the method and execution in the novel was poor, to say the least. 




 David Sedaris is literally the complete opposite of Burroughs. I'd recommend "Me Talk Pretty One Day" to start it off. You may easily find yourself laughing out loud in public though, so you've been warned. :-) 




 Wish I could answer your question, but while on the subject of Burroughs, I enjoyed Running with Scissors but found Dry to be a bit cliche at times. I guess it didn't help too that during the time in which I'd read his stuff I was also tagging off on David Sedaris' stuff. So really, the two couldn't be more opposite and I guess I was just drawn to the things that made me laugh a little bit more.  




 I just finished Sarah's Key last week and I've been meaning to ask fellow readers what they thought about it (assuming they've read it, of course).

I for one really enjoyed the parallel storylines throughout the first half of the book, but found myself pretty disappointed when that stopped abruptly and focused on the journalist's side. Then, with about 60 pages or so left in the book, I knew exactly where it was going (all the way up to the big "reveal") and immediately found myself begging for the end to come. I liken it to my reading of "A Farewell to Arms," whereby I knew "it" was coming and found myself outright mixed with vindications and guilt for being right with two pages remaining (vague? Perhaps. Just trying not to be spoilery). I guess I'm totally open to being wrong with my assumptions whenever I'm reading. 

OK - Sarah's Key. Thoughts? 




 Thanks so much. It was a lot of fun to write. 




 (A joint project between myself and Mr_Agucci)

Anne shut off the burner on the stove, placed the lid on top of the mashed potatoes and walked it to the dining room, oven mitts on of course. After opening the door with her back to the family, she spun around with the goods in hand, ready to finally sit down for another hearty Wilson Family Feast.

OK boys and girls, dinners served. Pray then eat. Will, its your turn to lead the prayers.

The family bowed their heads in respects around the table, as Will took center stage.

Good food, good meat, good God, lets eat.

William! Anne shouted, the insult of her sons actions lending a crack to her voice. You will say your prayers and you will say them correctly!

Sorry mom. Sometimes its hard to know what to say, but everyone knows a good prayer goes a long way.

Fed up with her sons actions, Anne turned to her husband, who mumbled a quick prayer and kicked off the evenings meal. 

Mom these potatoes really hit the spot, but have you ever seen the power of the Quick Chop? Will asked. 

Anne looked up from her plate. Im sorry butwhat?

Yeah, what are you going on about boy? his father asked.

Will, unresponsive to his parents comments, continued to chomp away at his dinner, unfazed by the awkwardness that began to hang over the table.
Unprompted, Will dropped his fork onto the table and began to sob uncontrollably.

Son, whats the matter? Anne asked.

I must admit I havent felt like myself, more like Im living the life of someone else.

I just dont get the rhyming, Sally, Wills older sister chimed in. 

Shush you, said Anne. Your brother is obviously distressed. She turned back to Will and nodded for him to continue.

I woke up this morning as the sun came in, wondering how my day would begin. It felt like any day but I cant recall, all I know is I didnt feel like myself at all.

Then whodidyou feel like? Anne asked.

Will paused and collected his thoughts, eyeing his family nervously as he continued. I know that this is going to sound silly, but I feel like my name once was Billy.

It is Billy, you idiot, his sister said. We just call you Will because Dad goes by the name of Bill.

Do NOT call your brother an idiot! their father shouted.

Whimpering in response to the scream, Auger, the familys black lab and Wills closest confidant, walked away with his head hung low, the smell of his urine stain permeating through the room. Concerned for his best friend  after all, he did name the awesome pup years ago  Will snapped into action. 

Powered by the air you breathe, activated by the water you and I drink. Its Mother Nature approved!

A pin could have dropped at the dinner table as every member of the Wilson family turned to face Will. 

Hey, at least it wasnt a rhyme this time, Sally said, before realizing the error of her own ways. Damn

What did you say, son? Bill said, all eyes on Will.

I love beautiful wood, dont you?

Well yeah, but

It takes the hard work out of yard work!

Oh God. No. No, please, Anne said, cupping her hand over her mouth in fear of the reality before her.

What is it honey? Bill asked.

Its

HI! Billy Mays here for Flies Away! Will erupted, filling the room with his suddenly-booming voice. 

As the family cringed in response, nearing hysteria and fighting the urge to flee, Wills eyes rolled into the back of his head, as a dizzying sense of balance overwhelmed him and sent him face first into his plate of mashed potatoes. 

Remember, he mumbled, face first in the mound of food. Nothing absorbs the shock quite like Impact Gels. 




 Funny to see the main image being Stephen King. The first book that came to mind before I even clicked the link was "Thinner," but I GUESS he gets a pass since he wrote that under his pen name.

Also, the "cameo" was just his characters suggesting a scenario was like "something out of a Stephen King novel."
