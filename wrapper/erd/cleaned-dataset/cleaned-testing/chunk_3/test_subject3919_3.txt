 1. I have problems sleeping face up and I can only sleep on my left side. Can I preform WILD on my side? Cause' in all the tutorials they are on their back.

2. What positions should I keep my jaw in?

3. What should be going through my head?

Please don't answer if you haven't successfully done WILD. I always seem to get answers from those people.  

Thanks!

 The title didn't say anything about where this is from. So I'm just here to say this is about The Power Puff Girls. 




 I love the basher, but I really just want the normal s.weapons. I will also any consider offers.
 




 Thanks, first time here. You probably gathered that though......  




 Finally, Thank you! 




 It's eating away my insides! Please help!

 Accept the mission, get to that room kill them, DON'T GRAB THE NOTE, save-quit, repeat! 









 alright sweet! any tips on the relaxation before? 




 no way. http://www.amazon.com/Stereo-Cruiser-Complete-Skateboard-22-5x6-Inch/dp/B005LEVONM 




 WILD is completely **safe**, but is not recommended by most because it is very difficult and can be very **traumatizing**. 

you make me want to try and not want to try so much 




 No problem! 




 that's sweet, but flag it nsfw for the people who are "working" 




 987 thanks for giving back to the community! 









 A longboard. 




 Omg, I fucking loved that part of that beautiful game! 




 that comic sans font makes it 









 Beg your pardon? 




 Wow, that's so well done. 









 Is this Jiminy Peak in Massachusetts? I'm there right now!

 YOU WALKED INTO THE WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD, MOTHERFUCKER! 




 *sigh* It's a reference to a video game....... 









 MY NIPPLES ARE AS HARD AS DIAMONDS, NOW I'M SO EXCITED! 




 Forget Skyrim, it's a great game and all that, but the real fun is in Oblivion and Morrowind. Skyrim's quests are all the same, "I lost my ring! Please go into the random fucking cave and get it for me. Watch out for draugrs!"
While the other gameS in the series are like, "I lost my ring! Please get it for me it's in the well! ....... Haha! now you're trapped! I can use you in my demonic ritual now! WAIT NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING! NO, STOP EXPOSING ME AS A NECROMANCER!" 




 A old age of empires-like game called Black and White 2 is awesome, you can be a evil god to your cities or a good god, you get to control the world with this big hand and it changes as you become evil or good, also the wars in the game are cool too because you can do things like throw rocks at the other armies.

Any fable game would also be a good choice, it's an RPG where you make choices that make yourself good or evil, your weapons, armour and spells depend on your good and evil traits too. You can do things like marry someone, have kids, THEN BRUTALLY MURDER THEM :D!

Lastly Just Cause 2, short description, fuck the storyline, go be a terrorist on the huge sandbox map you have to explore. You can do things like, steal a car, cover it in C4 drive it off a bridge, land on a speed boat, jump out of the car, grapple hook onto a chopper, throw out the pilot, shoot the C4 with a missle and watch the whole thing go up in flames. Plus being on PC you can mod the game and do things like give yourself unlimited ammo and invincibility!  




 Dishonored is a completely different game mechanic but it has that great sneaky-peeky feel to it, also Hitman: Absolution has a similar mechanic and it has a lot of options as far as how you can complete the mission, lots of cool kills in that game. 




 I'm super extrovert, but I'm not triggered by speaking just sounds. 









 Oh it was a apple product? Good, it got what it had coming. 




 No, you're just misusing the term "gay". Grow up.

 ahhhhh..... 




 Can you repeat yourself, I didn't quite understand. 




 Like i said EVERYTHING, i have EVERY ledgendary 




 I already have them all soo :/ 




 Lol bro I can give you, well EVERYTHING. I have 'em all, some coo uniques too all lvl 50 PSN:test_subject3919 




 I agree with all of the games he just stated, also "army of two" isn't fps but the co-op is very good.

I also think Dead Island is amazing, lot's of fun

PS: Killzone 3 is co-op, source: http://www.co-optimus.com/review/703/page/1/killzone-3-co-op-review.html 




 When I came into elementary school, everyone was mean to each other, it was a toddler popularity battle. So when I got to middle school, most everyone put that behind them. I didn't. I was a ass to one kid for about 1.5 years then I had a teacher who kind of became my mentor. He never knew I was a bully, But he taught me human values. I stopped being mean to him and we were kind of acquaintances. The next year in high school I said I was deeply sorry and that I knew there was no way I could fully make it up to him. He did forgive me though. After that I became SUPER sensitive to any form of bully, no to me though, to other people. I stood up for people as much as possible. Not sure if this helps, or even if this will be seen, but best description I have is ALOT of self resentment and guilt that the bully doesn't know how to deal with. 




 Half Life 3 




 That's skull kid, not majora, majora is the name of the mask. Awesome drawing anyways keep it up. 




 No, they're even I think. I have won on both sides with no trouble. 




 seven reference? 




 Why does it matter that I pointed it out, I wasn't starting shit. I skateboard and longboard. If someone replied something like "shut the fuck up, longboards are better!" they would be the one starting said shit. 




 I have them all also PSN: test_subject3919 




 That's a skateboard, silly.

I there anything I can upgrade while staying around the same price, or is there something I'm overpaying for?

Edit: I have a extra copy of win 7. 




 Look up "all day awareness" 




 Please I beg you, no more 90's memes! 




 Wow sweet man, thanks so much! http://i.imgur.com/vTOLBcn.gif here's a happy dog. 




 When I find stuff like this, I just walk into on purpose like a broken videogame, blocking the door for everyone else. 




 So, if I wanted to get the cooling system later that would be all good? Also I was wondering about this PC's performance with a over the top game like crysis 3, I don't think I'm even gonna play Crysis 3, but I was just curious.

Thanks so much for the help! 




 I could go a little bit higher on the price too (530$ish) is there anything more you would recomend adding? 




 Cool I'm going to send this build to a close friend and see what he says. Thanks so much! 




 Waht reasons would I need to overclock for? 




 Thanks for all the help. :D 




 I'm sorry if I have done this wrong, if so please tell me and I will edit the post, or delete it if it needs fixing.

I'm looking to play on a BF3 graphics (high to medium) level; but I don't know what that looks like. I don't have a very large budget but I can afford this one (max about 530$ish).

I already have a copy of win7 so that's no on there for that reason. If I did this completely wrong, or there is a different better/ inexspensive part, please, do tell. Thanks for the help. :)

edit: spelling

Holy shit this sub is amazing! 




 Um, I don't need that lol. I need heads. 




 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJUhlRoBL8M
 




 Holy fucking shit, I shit you not mine too. (minus the fact I had diarreah instead of having a nice shit) 




 "I'm going to make a video about my opinion, but I'm gonna disable ratings and comments so people can't post their ideas!" 




 SNIPING! I don't know how they could expand on it, I guess just having cool places where you could do said sniping. 




 Just ask, I also have lots of cool uniques like, rex, cobra, multiple sandhawks, fibber ect. 




 I have just recently got all of the legendary guns on PS3, and I want to try out the other characters but I don't feel like leveling up 3 others. ( have Zer0 and Axton finished) So I tried to use gibbed save editor and had no luck. Error after error. There aren't any good tutorials on how to do it for PS3 so I would love if someone could explain it in full detail. 




 I have you added James, I'm test_subject3919 and if you don't already have it i can dupe you 




 Dude it's a serious question, it's something he's afraid of. Just because you're annoyed by someone trying to get help on a sub where that's totally welcome doesn't mean you get to be a bully and talk about how cool you are, when you say "All I do is wait it and and boooom close your eyes and think of a dream or a mirror and ENTER IT" (or whatever the hell that gibberish means.) or how you "had a Dementor from Harry Potter suck my face when I was in bed. No fucks given. Get the hell over it."

You're not some all knowing lucid dreamer, you're a bully on reddit, and you're the shit that's wrecking this sub *and* reddit as a whole. You fucking snob.

 




 You don't need to specify that they are elemental, norfleet's are maliwan guns and therefor they will always be elemental. 




 Please if you post, follow the format! 




 I have it if youll give dupe me a non-elemental one. psn:test_subject3919 




 ...... Luigi? 




 I have all legendayrs (not heads though) 




 If I want to take a trip, and one of the three reasons for me to go is food (the others being music and nature). Would Iceland be a good choice? 




 [They're already here!](http://i.minus.com//imodkOMDqw6hq.gif) 




 I can help, are you fighting ultra ivicible or normal? psn: test_subject3919 




 I want there to be random legendary drops like in the first game, but you can also get Red Text legendarys like in the second. A bigger backpack would be nice too. 




 Well I did and I loved it. Not sure if that helps I don't have time to write a paragraph now but i would still reccomend it. 




 as a Jacob I decline this 




 You could use it to go to the future! Although, it might be faster to wait normaly.... 




 The worst for me being a diabetic is when i ask someone for like a single m m or something like that and I get the response "WILL U DIEEEE?????"
At least they care. 




 The vermi head for axton and I'll take anything else as far as legendary heads go 




 I'm pretty sure those don't exist. Could you still dupe me those legendary heads? 




 I have a sapping, I'm assuming your using it for pyro pete; It works like a charm! 




 Yeah, I'm a legendary fanatic and I have been getting all lvl 50s in my farming! 




 [TURN DAT FROWN UPSIDE DOWN](http://imgur.com/fz1tWeg) 




 Want 'em all? just add me: test_subject3919 




 Sure I can help, I also have almost every legendary in the game. We could kill pyro pete if you have the dlc, It would go faster with the evil smasher glitch if you don't care that i use that or not, also you should get the relic from moxi that gives bonus xp PSN:test_subject3919 




 I had tons of fun beating the campaign solo, it can be done it's a little bit harder than co-op and after you beat everything you can do what im doing now and collect all of the special guns. Plus with sub-reddits like [r/coopplay ](http://www.reddit.com/r/coopplay) and [r/borderlands](http://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands) you can get co-op players easy!
I completely recommend this game, it's my favorite. 




 Thanks for the offer but my friend already covered that 




 All of 'em 




 oh, lol.  I won't be on until later today 




 Just got that from a friend, do you need anything though? 




 I just got slayer mod for you and i have bolth of those sheilds, seriously name ANYTHING 

and I don't think you added me right I didn't get the request 




 * Step one: cover tack in tuna residue.
* Step numero duo: Take pics of cat grabbing the tac
* NUMBA THREE: Put treat in the shoe of choice
* fhheeeerrrr: Take pics of cat grabbing treat where you cannot see the treat
* feyeve: Put tac in identica shoe and photograph that shit
* sex: ???????
* sehverrn: PROFFIT $$$$ 




 I have all but slag hawks do you have: bouncing Bonnie, nasty surprise, and I would like legendary heads if you could give them to me preferably zer0 or axton heads! PSN: test_subject3919 




 Why not legendary hunter. Like I said I have all of the legendarys except those! 




 PSN: test_subject3919 

want:
transformer,
bouncing Bonnie,
nasty surprise,
and I would like legendary heads if you could give them to me preferably zer0 or axton heads!

I don't have the badaboom, but I DON'T want it because I would like to get the last legendary for myself.

Almost all of my guns are lvl 50 except striker is 48 and neogenator and blackhole are 49s I also have sandhawks, evil smasher and fibber 




 PERLECENT GOD DAMNIT! 




 DON'T DISS THE ORANGE!!!
