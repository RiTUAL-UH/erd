 How about depending how much shipping is I'll pay it. I live in the New England area.  




 Another game I have you may be interested in is Transformers: the first Cybertron one. The case is a little messed up but the game itself works perfectly.  




 Nothing that may interest you. Cut really short on ps3 games ever since I sold it. Would you mind just coming to an agreement for just the collection? I apologize. 




 Do you like quality of game? And can I see your pictures? Plus another game I have NBA 2K13 if that means anything.  




 http://imgur.com/a/ijSxW here is the collection. I think into the nexus is currently in my friends possession if it cannot be found I'll list some other games that may peak your interest.  




 Yeah I have a character for each position that I'm decent at but I'm just really good at those guys. Thank you. 




 Hey guys, I'm about to start ranked play and was just wondering who gets banned. I play Odin which concerns me a little, but also play a lot of Apollo and Mercury. Thanks guys. 




 Classy response.  




 Okay thank you, man. For being understanding. I'll do it as soon as I can! 




 May I do it tomorrow? I'm off my computer and unfortunately cannot send the pictures from my phone. Does that sound okay? 




 I'm going to take the pictures of into the nexus right now.  




 It won't let me post it on gameswap. It says it only allows text posts. Is there another way I can successfully send you the picture?  




 I can't send the pictures through the comment but I will post them on gameswap and just go to my account to see them. Sorry for the inconvenience.

 




 Both really really nice. Will send pictures right now. Let me get them and send the pictures. May I ask you do the same? 




 Yes sir. 4 games total.
