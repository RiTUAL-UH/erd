 Haha its my highschool senior picture for the yearbook :) 









 ive had my blonde since my 9th grade year, and now im a 12th grader. i really dont want to part with it when i have to get a job.... :( 




 Grouch Marx mustache = her eyebrows 




 New pictures are up :) 









 im working on it :) the holiday season keeps me busy at work!

EDIT: The new pictures are up!  




 My "long side" of the haircut was maybe up to my collarbone when i first got it, and i HATED it so much, but i too my moms advice and let it grow out and im soooo glad i did! 




 our routine is almost identical! but my main question is: do you use liquid or powder foundation? i use powder, so i hope that if i apply concealer on top it wont look cakey.  




 the glamoflauge Lite comes in na double ended crayon, so i apply the lighter concealer first and then the darker/peachier shade to conceal even more. i then blend the corners with a blending sponge, but i find that my problem area (dark circles) arent concealed as well as i had hoped 




 Army strong  




 Oh my goodness I used to get that ALL the time! My freshman year of highschool my hair was long and burgundy and everyone would tell me that!! And thanks so much :)  




 I'm not sure its a joke... She was pretty instagram famous (~4k followers) but half of then were haters telling her that her brows looked terrible. So now she's going "all natural" and combing her brow hairs upwards so they look all furry. I dont think she understands that her new trend isn't helping her... 









 I decided to cave in and buy Hard Candy's Glamoflauge Lite concealer because i ran out of IT cosmetics bye-bye under eye. I tried it out today and i saw no visible change for my extremely dark circles under my eyes. I read up on MUA that it would work better if i applied above my foundation, but i wear powder so i dont know if that will work... Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get the best coverage out of Glamoflauge? Because i really want it to work!  




 [srs] she actually reposted it. she took more pictures, but in the original she did some artsy angle where you couldnt even see the pink eyeshadow, and even in the repost you can barely see it.... 









 My favorite color is dark green! Its enchanting and reminds me of a Forest and contrasts well with my skin tone. My favorite shade is Melt cosmetics Blow! Seriously, its gorgeous

Pantone 




 Do you know if the gamepiece comes with UD orders from Ulta? I ordered a butt ton of UD products for cyber Monday so I'm just wondering if its possible to get ome 




 I have been dying to get my hands on the Limecrime Venus palette, and I even signed up for email alerts for when its back in stock...m but I cant justify buying a $50 eye shadow when I could probably find dupes for $20. Its the packaging that makes mw want it :( 




 Name it "Afteryu" and when people ask "hey, what did you name your boat?" you can reply "afteryu", and the people will automatically be flattered that you named the boat after them, but when they see the name of the boat they will feel like idiots 




 Definitely the Real Techniques kits! They're pretty in expensive for the quality as well 




 A few weeks ago I received CC that I should try to fill in my brows more and to try out a more "dewy" look. I took the advice, so what do you think?
