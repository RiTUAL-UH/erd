 Every young guy gets overly hung up on the idea of getting laid and kissing girls. I won't deny that it is fun, but it is nowhere near as important as society/the media makes it out to be. The annoying thing is you won't truly accept that, regardless of how many times you are told, until you get laid, look back and see for yourself. Vacations are also fun experiences, but there is no need to feel suicidal if you haven't got to travel yet, it will just come later. There is so much more to life.

What's more, it isn't as if *everyone* around you is getting laid like you think. That's just another misconception- sex is sensationalized to such a degree very few people your age will openly tell you they are virgins even if they are. I can think of a few guys I know in their mid 20s who have never had sex and there is nothing wrong with them, they are decent looking, have normal social lives, college degrees and good jobs, it just didn't happen yet with them. (Thinking back I had short, sexual relationships with two women before my current long term girlfriend and if I would have chosen to stay at home the night I met these girls, or approached other, less interested, people instead there is every chance I would be in the same situation as you). Don't be too hard on yourself. 

Having said all this, there are plenty of ways you can increase your chances of finding yourself a girl. Get out there more and increase your social circle by going to local events, classes or bars with your friends. Go to the gym and pay attention to the clothes, shoes, hairstyle etc. that you present yourself with. Have hobbies and interests outside of just hanging out with friends/girls so that you have other things to focus on while you're single and something to talk about with your girl when you eventually meet her. Hell, there are even apps now that let you speak to girls in your local area who rate you as attractive! Use them for practice if anything.

The best advice I can give you is to chill out. Don't be obsessed with girls, don't be obsessed with yourself (as this shooter was, though obviously that was a problem with his own mental health) and find a few cool hobbies that will give you something else to do and make you look interesting to the girls you meet in the future.  




 I think people from Europe generally have a completely different perspective from Americans when it comes to timescale. Growing up in England my childhood home was built in the 1840s, and that isn't at all uncommon. The school I went to was founded in the early 1600s. European cities often contain buildings that are *thousands* of years old so we can truly appreciate how short our lives are in the grand scheme of things. My mum knew people who were around at the same time as Abraham Lincoln.. its really not that long ago at all.

Edit: Just did some reading and found out that if my old school was in the United States it would be the 11th oldest building in the country and my town's little church would be top 5. Crazy. 




 Hey man, you're right, life sucks real bad sometimes. We've all screwed up at some point, we all have regrets. Its not healthy to keep thinking back to the past. 

I have a little experience with what you've been through. I messed up and my best friend, the girl I thought I'd be with forever, broke up with me aged 18. It was hell on earth at the time because she cut me entirely out of her life and for a very long time I thought about her every single day. Looking back, the fact that we had no contact after the break up is one of the best things that could have happened for me. It may be tough to hear but it sounds like she really doesn't want to be with you, and that is her choice. You are young. There are literally billions of other girls in the world and if you keep pushing through things will change. You will start to move on. It may take years, but you will find someone else and you will be happy again. And when it happens you can look back and thank yourself for holding on in the darkest times to allow a better future to arrive.

She'll always have a place in your heart. The first girl you fell in love with will always be a special thing in your life, you'll never really forget her but you will slowly move on and the strong feelings will pass. Trust me when I say there is someone else out there who you *will* love in the future, they *will* love you back and, if you want to, you *will* spend your lives together- and it will be far more special than this first girl. 

Cut her out of your life. Allow yourself to slowly move on no matter how long it takes and how much you want to give in. You will have a bigger chance at love. It happened for me and everyone I know, it will happen for you. You just need to eventually find the strength to go out there and get it.
