 Dude....

I get it....She said "I think I'm done now" because she was done killing o-o.

People like that fascinate me. I mean, what in the world possesses them to do something like that? What was so traumatic or heartbreaking in their lifetime that they felt the need to kill? 

I've been pretty broken before, I've been downright pissed at people who'd hurt me, but I never wished them dead, nor would I ever attempt to kill them.  




 She never said whether it ever actually died or not. 

But she did say that her mother claimed to see it several more times, standing in their yard years after it ran off,just standing there, staring into the window, only to go and get my grandmas dad and find that the dog was gone.  




 Can you imagine waking up and realizing you're not asleep anymore? =O

Happened to me this morning. and Yesterday and pretty much every day since the day I was born =(
