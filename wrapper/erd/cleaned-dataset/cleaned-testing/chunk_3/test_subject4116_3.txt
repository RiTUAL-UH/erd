 Best idea I've heard yet! 




 I was waiting for you to show up. You didn't disappoint. 




 Don't rack your brain, I'm sure it will come to you. 




 Maybe it's the ability to give your life in exchange for your family to be set and live comfortably. What do you care? You sell crap to strangers. 




 I got a box in the mail about two weeks ago. I used to love getting packages. I opened it, and found that the only thing inside was a bloody gray stump. A finger.

Then I woke up.

I wish that this was where the story ended; a bad dream. I couldn't get back to sleep after that. It had felt so real. After giving up on sleep, and getting showered and dressed, I went downstairs to find that my kitchen sink had clogged. A steak knife had fallen deep into the drain. When I reached inside to pull it out, the disposal kicked on. For a second, I saw a flash of my pale severed flesh being buffeted around by the whirling blades. I never found the finger.

I wish that was where the story ended.

But in last night's dream, I got another package. Inside was a brain.

I'm not getting out of bed today. 




 I was more just pointing out the hypocrisy of anyone saying "That's a trope! You suck!" when stories outside the norm don't even get read. 




 I like it. I know a guy who goes by the name of /u/Grindhorse.

The beginning sounds really choppy. Short sentences; this, then this, then this. Maybe there's a way to make it flow a little better.

Definitely agree about the shortened ending. I sort of read it as "I'm sorry. It's almost time. Blah. Blah. Blah."

I think the main way you could improve the story is to create more sympathy with the narrator's character. They need some humanity! A lot of the focus is on the sister, and I love her, but she died. I know how her arc ends, it was tragic. But why should I care if the narrator is dying? I don't love them (yet). 




 Another vote for hanged. 




 "I make gifs reddit just for fun."

Is that what it's supposed to say? 




 Here's something: God forbid you  actually write something totally original. There wouldn't be anyone there to read it! NoSleep is actually a culprit of this. It's like they came here to get more of the same thing that brought them back here in the first place! 




 I was debating. (*Another* bathroom story?) Now I've got to read it. 




 At least it didn't say something else! 




 I'm not the killer. I've named him the Krampus in my mind - it's not a perfect allegory, but...

He might still be out there. That family... It's hard to talk about. 




 At least let me pull my pants back up before you flay me. 




 I don't know who originally had the tape. I got it in 2012 when I bought the camera at a yard sale. It made me sick to see so much death. 




 That's one way to look at it, thanks. Makes me feel a little bit better. 




 Thanks. I decided not to throw too many twists in there and just stick with the prompt. It's a great picture. 




 My Queen! Thanks for the encouragement and the new favorite word (rottener).

 Guests would be arriving soon. Family from faraway places that Wallace only got to see once a year, and then only *if* they could make it. The thing was an eyesore that had to go. A testament to the laziness of the person who owned in the house it sat in front of. And it wasnt even his.

On Halloween, the jack-o-lantern had just... sprung up, when everyone elses had been destroyed by kids with their bats.

Wallace couldnt put his finger on what terrified him about it. Maybe it was the eyes, the way the empty sockets would follow him, even at night. Maybe it was the way it continued to glow every night, even though hed never once lit the candle inside. Or, the reason he was afraid to stick his finger anywhere near the mouth, those sharpened orange teeth along the top row that would extend and retract whenever he was around. Perhaps it was the smell like death that sometimes wafted through the windows since it had shown up.

It was time that he threw it out.

He wore his wifes gardening gloves. *Its getting rotten and I dont want to touch it,* he told himself. 

He rolled over a lidded can, and even brought a big rock to put on top. *I dont want the wind blowing it over,* he told himself.

The pumpkin skittered and rolled through a gap in the boards and disappeared under the house.

*I was right,* he told himself. 




 I want to apologize, but cant. The guilt of losing a piece of my towns history is burning a hole in my gut, but its not something that I can just talk about with them. Its not something that you can just bring up in casual conversation.

History can be a powerful thing in the wrong hands. A persons reputation controls them, and in a small town like mine, their history defines them. The antidote then, is to control your own history - to keep evidence, to continue remembering.

I lost a video tape, one of those little ones that fits inside a portable camcorder, and now I cant even apologize for it... but maybe I can make up for it, even a little. By sharing it with you. This piece of history, uncut, unaltered: the truth.

The tape begins in mid-November, 1993. Peter Smith, 8 years old at the time was given the camcorder by his uncle for his birthday. The first five minutes or so is mainly made up of the kind of stuff youd expect an 8-year-old to film; clipped conversations, awkward shots of family members half out of frame, people singing happy birthday where the camera cant decide where to focus because of the dim lighting of the candles.

Without warning, it changes to the inside of a cramped apartment. Childrens toys and clothes scatter the floor. Peter is doing a fake newscast in his bedroom. His sister Nicole, just five years old, does a convincing impression of the local weatherman, capped with a back to you, Pete!

Together, they belt out a breaking news theme, trumpets, drums and all.

Their father bursts into frame. Keep it down! he hisses. Your mother is trying to sleep!

Peter, frozen on camera, looks mortified. He suddenly seems very out of place wearing his fathers tie over his Power Rangers sweatshirt, blond hair cut into a 90s bowl.

Nicole speaks up. But mommy sleeps all the time! We never get to do anything anymore!

Peter leaves his seat and steps out of frame. Randall, their father, crosses in front, kneeling down to hug his daughter. Just before the tape transitions again, you can hear him say, Shes sick, baby. She-

*-clip-*

In the next shot, the family is packing boxes into the back of an orange and white moving truck. Dad, can I keep the camera out and film this? Peter asks from behind the lens.

Sure, champ! Randall is loading a box labeled clothes into the truck. Hes smiling. Its obvious that some time has passed since the last scene, and seeing him now is a huge contrast to last time he was on the camera. A blue plaid shirt stretches across his broad chest. Hes grown a beard, and the new look suits him well.

Where are we going daddy? Nicole asks.

Oh, baby. I told you, were moving to Oregon.

Ory-gun? Why?

The cute factor of this five year old is killer. Shes adorable. Long, dark hair hangs down nearly to the bottom of her puffy, dark blue winter coat. The coat forces her arms out from her sides, and a pink beanie with a frilly pom-pom tops the whole spectacle like a cherry.

Were going to start over there.

Start over? Like Noah?

Randy smiles widely. What do you know about Noah?

He put all the animals in his art and there was a biiig flood, and then the sun came out and God gave them a rainbow. Then they started over.

Thats very good, honey. And youre absolutely right, were going to put everything on our ark, he gestures to the moving truck, and were going to start over new.

Is God going to give us a rainbow when we get to... to...

Oregon?

Yeah, Ory-gun.

Maybe hon-

*-clip-*

The tape skips again, for several minutes, Peter films out the window as cars and brightly-colored signs fly past. He quickly pans, showing his sister in the carseat next to him, and his mother, Quincy, driving. The orange moving truck can just be seen ahead of them through the windshield.

*-clip-*

Did you get it? Did you get that?" Quincy asks. The camera is moving all over the place. You can hear the belt unbuckle and Peter points the camera out the back window of the car. Auto-focus struggles and then settles on the rain-covered glass.

No! I missed it, youve got to go back!

I cant go back, Pete. Its okay, though.

Nicole starts crying.

No mom, weve got to go back and film it. We have to!

Were not gonna make it to Ory-gun, now! Nicole wails hopelessly.

Nicky! Nicky! Its okay! Were *in* Oregon. We just didnt film the sign at the border, thats all. Its alright, now calm down.

Peter mumbles a Sorry, Nicky, before shutting the camera off again.

*-clip-*

You see Randall and the kids in a hotel room with two queen-sized beds. McDonalds happy meals and wrappers are on the tables. Nicole is squealing, jumping on the beds. She looks like shes never had more fun.

Dad, video tape us! Peter says, and hands the camera to his father. After a few fumbling seconds, it turns to show Peter now in place on top of one bed, his sister on the other facing him across the divide.

Ready? Peter says. Go!

The two jump. Peter easily clears the gap, doing a bellyflop on the other side, but Nicole lands on the hard edge of the bed. She starts crying and Randall immediately sets the camera on the bed, facing the wall.

The door bangs open and as Quincy comes in from outside the room. Shut up! God damn it, what the fuck are you doing, Randy?

Sorry, Quin, we-

Shut her up. Shes going to wake everyone in the fucking hotel.

Hey, cool it, Quin. Please?

Im going to go finish my smoke. Pete, its time for bed.

Mom!

Ssshut up! Just shut up! Jesus, all day long with you and... she trails off and the door slams shut.

Nicole and Peters sniffling is the only thing you can hear for a a few seconds. Randall breaks the silence. Its okay. Youre okay. Lets just get ready for bed. You know what tomorrow is?

We get to our new home? Peter asks.

Thats right, and were going to start over over there, remember? Things are going to be different. I promise. Okay guys?

Okay.

Now lets go brush our teeth.

The camera stays on, ignored on the bed next to the wall. When the kids have come back and are tucked into bed, Nicole asks, Daddy? I dont think mommy likes me. I dont want her to come back.


Heyyy, Randy says soothingly. Mommys going to be okay again. I promise. Remember how she used to play with you all the time? Remember before... before she got sick?

No.

Well *I* remember. And you know what? Shes still your mommy, and shes part of our family, so we love her no matter what. And I love *you* no matter what. And you too, mister.

Love you too, dad.

The front door opens again. Quincy sighs, Finally.

Hey... Quin, can we talk?

Randy, Im fucking tired. I really dont need to hear it right now.

Come on, Quincy. Just... You promised youd try this.

I am trying. What do you call this? Moving hours away from everything just because your friend is selling his house?

Sh! Lets go outside.

Fine, but you say one thing about your new pal Jesus, and Im gonna...

Just... Youre going to wake the kids. They dont need to hear us like this.

The door closes and though the voices start off muffled, you can hear that Quincy is shouting. Eventually, Randy comes in to go to bed and turns off the camera.

*-clip-*

In the next shot, the family has already arrived at the new house. Peter is running outside while making motor noises with his mouth. Nicole is sitting on the porch steps, organizing her pink Barbie backpack.

A white, two-story house sits in the middle of a grassy clearing surrounded by tall evergreens. A hand-made garage and a gravel driveway that leads to the main road are the only other things in the grassy clearing. Dark clouds hang low over the house.

Peter steers onto the large front porch, through the front door into a furnished living room, catching a glimpse of his parents sitting at dining room table, then barreling down the hallway and out the back door. As he runs beside the porch again, his father calls his name.

Youd better come in! It looks like its going to rain out there!

Aw!

Wheres your sister?

I dunno!

Nicky!

They continue to call and look for her, checking behind the garage and in all the rooms of the house. Quincy joins them outside, hands stuffed into her pockets, dark hair blowing wildly in the stirring wind.

Where could she be? Randall says, returning from the driveway. I mean, she couldnt have gotten far, right? I knew we should have gotten the phones hooked up sooner.

I think she left, Randy.

What? No. She probably just...

Its happening again, Randy. Shes so quiet that the turbulent wind very nearly swallows her words.

Quincy, its-

We lost her!

We didnt *lose* her. What are you talking about?

Fuck you, Randy. You know what Im talking about. Quincy goes inside, leaving Randall staring at the empty space that she just occupied. Snowflakes have started falling in force.

*-clip-*

Peter and Randall are in the car, making their way down a narrow gravel road.

Dad, where are we going?

Were going to go into town so we can get the police to help us find your sister.

Trees are blurring by on the both sides, the gravel path winding between them. Snow has fallen in the areas where the branches above are sparse and flakes are starting to pile up on the windshield.

The gravel driveway drops down a final steep incline to find a two lane highway with wide shoulders. Randy slams on the brakes, and the car skids in the soft wet gravel.

What? Randall says.

What is it dad?

I dont know...

Is that a person?

Randall opens the car door and crosses in front of the cars headlights. Peter is pointing the camera through the window onto the road, but its impossible to see anything there in the gathering darkness.

Randall jogs a short way, then suddenly stops and raises a hand to his mouth. He bends down and scoops up a shapeless black form. Zoomed in, the camera is shaking in Peters hands.

Get in the back seat, Pete, he says through the glass. Randy opens the door and lays the dark mass in the passenger seat. The camera zooms out and another mans pale face comes into focus.

*-clip-*

What the FUCK are you doing? Who the FUCK is that, Randall?

I found him on the road. Hes hurt, but I didnt see a car or anything.

And you just *brought him here?*

The roads are closed going both ways. The trees are just blowing over everywhere. Every few feet another one is down.

Jesus, is he even breathing?

Randall carries the tiny man over to the couch in the open living area, in front of the wood stove.

And what about Nicole, Randy? Did you see her?

Im going to keep looking. I dont know how long I can stay out in this weather. Ill try to get through to the neighbors houses, at least. Maybe she just got lost and went over there. Its going to be fine.

You- youre leaving me here? With *him*? And what if he wakes up? I dont believe this.

Pete follows his father out onto the porch with the camera. The snow is falling so thickly that the little shed not 100 feet from the house is completely obscured. Wind blows audibly on the microphone, creating a hiss.

Stay here! Randall shouts at Peter and points back into the house. He disappears into the flurry. Peter takes the camera back inside, and films the falling snow through the window.

Nicky.

The whisper is just barely audible.

He turns toward the living room. The black-clothed stranger is lying there on the couch, unmoved. Peter comes in close with the camera, putting it right up to the mans face. It looks contorted, like hes snarling in pain. Rigid, scraggly hair clings to the mans chin and cheeks, tapering off as it rises to the mans spotted, bleeding scalp. Black scabs the size of Snapple caps adorn his head. Purple lips and sunken eye sockets lend to the mans overall shabby, sick appearance.

Nicky.

The camera is pointed directly on the mans lips. The thin purple lines take up the whole frame. They dont move, but you can clearly hear the whisper.

Nicky.

Peter! shouts Quincy from the stairs behind him. Upstairs!

She catches him mid-step as he flies up the stairs. You dont go near that man again. Do you hear me? You stay away from him.

*-clip-*

From the top of the stairs, the camera points down on the front door and the dark living room. A few glowing coals remain in the fireplace. Randys jacket is still white with snow. In the dim light, the camera has difficulty finding something to focus on.

What are we going to do, Randy?

Its out of our hands now. He looks exhausted, bedraggled. His jacket stays stiff as he hangs it up on the hook. Shes in His arms. Im going to pray now, and you can join me if you want.

No, thanks. Thats your department, but Ill send a letter to Santa, just to cover our bases.

What?

To Santa. Its a joke.

Wh- How could you say something like that?

You know... I think its like you said, maybe everything is going to be alright now. This could be a fresh start for us, baby. Quincys blurred form is moving closer, slowly.

Quincy, if youre trying to... mock me, this is really not the time.

Im not mocking you, Randy. Im being serious. Im sorry. For everything, I mean. When Olivia died, I mean... Things were bad before, but that just broke me. It was too much.

Randy hugs his wife and gulps back a sob. It was somehow worse, though... because there was still Nicole. They looked so much alike, do you remember, Randy? Do you remember all the little twin outfits and matching bows and shoes? And after she was gone, all of it was double. Extra. It killed me that I couldnt get rid of it, or throw it out. Because I still had *her* and we werent really allowed to move on.

You can see that Randall has pushed himself free of her arms now. He holds her at arms length.

I know you didnt want to listen when I told you this before... But I know she killed Olivia.

Shut up.

I know it. And having her there all the time, it was like living with her ghost.

Stop it, Quincy.

Now shes really gone, dont you see? It wasnt *natural* for one to be here without the other. We finally cleaned the slate. We can start over, now.

Shut the fuck up! Damn it, Quincy, it was an accident! Just stop it!

You know, I never forgot what you said when you first came home that night.

Dont.

What did you do to my daughter, Quincy? What did *you* do? Wheres *my* little girl?

Youre an alcoholic, Quincy. You were depressed - you were sick. Thats... Youre sick.

I dont feel sick anymore Randall. For the first time I can even remember, I feel... fine.

A curdled scream from the old man shakes the air and startles Peter who runs back down the hall and into his parents room, locking the door behind him.

Hes awake! Randy yells from the other side of the muffled bedroom door.

*-clip-*

-ome down and meet him. Now, he hasnt said anything yet, but were going to take him into town as soon as the light comes up. You and I are going to have to cut some of the trees up, you think you can help me with that?

Okay.

Great.

Randall looks like he didnt sleep at all the night before. His hair sticks out at odd angles and his face is pale and sagging. Even his smile looks weary.

Down the stairs, the man is sitting at the table with his back to Peter as he approaches.

Um, sir? Randall ventures. This is my son, Peter. Sorry, hes into video taping everything right now.

The man turns slowly to stare through the camera at Peter. Chewing, his mouth works side to side like goats. Then he turns back, and methodically takes another spoonful of oatmeal.

Well, want some breakfast, champ?

Wheres mom?

I think shes still slee-

*-clip-*

Pete, already in the back seat of the car, watches as his father carries the skeletal form from the house. The sun is coming up, and even though a thick layer of snow covers the ground, the placid rain is beginning to thin it back down.

Slowly this time, Randy maneuvers down the gravel driveway.

Skid marks, he says as they reach the road. Look at that. Right there on the edge of the bank. I couldnt see them last night in the dark. Hold on a second, Im going to take a look.

Randy jumps out of the car and jogs across the highway. Peter zooms in. He turns around to say I can see his car! before he drops over the edge of the embankment and out of sight.

He zooms back in, and pans from side to side, scanning the road for his fathers reappearance. He stops as he notices that the old man has turned and is watching him with a vacant expression.

Do you know Nicky? Peter asks in barely more than a whisper.

The mans lips spread into a smile, revealing long, crooked teeth rotted and black at the gum line. His eyes dont leave the camera and Peter. He just stares and smiles.

The car door jerks open and Peter is pulled outside. Randall is back.

Dad! Dad, he knows something about Nicky!

I know.

Randall is clutching a pink backpack in his fist. With quick movements, he opens the trunk and exchanges the backpack for a wood saw, then moves around to the passenger door.

You son of a bitch, he says as he drags the man out by his coat collar. Unable to support his own weight, the man drops helplessly to the ground. Peter, get back in the car. Stay there. Randall drags the man by one leg over the embankment again and out of sight.

For a long time, Peter just sits in the car. You can hear him breathing.

*-clip-*

He turns the camera on, pointing down the road heading South and leaves it on for about thirty seconds before shutting it off.

*-clip-*

Theres some kind of noise outside the car like thrashing in the brush. After about a minute it goes away, and Peter turns it back off.

*-clip-*

Randall walks back across the road. There are no signs of the old man or the saw.

*-clip-*

Through the rain-streaked window of the house, Peter zooms the cameras focus on the point where the gravel driveway enters the woods. You can see his breath forming fog on the cold glass.

Dad, theres someone outside.

One broken headlight and half the silver grill of a huge truck just peek around the tree line.

What? The curtains move as Randy pulls them aside for a better look above the camera.

It looks like its crashed.

Yeah, it does. Maybe they hit one of those downed trees or something.

How come theyre not moving?

I dont know, Pete.

Seconds tick by.

Im going to go out there and see if theyre okay. Just stay here for now, alright?

Okay.

Randy opens the door.

Dad!

What?

Im scared.

Its okay, champ. I promise, okay? I love you.

Love you too.

Peter points the camera back out the window, and Randy pulls the door quietly shut. Soon, he steps off the porch and into the frame, walking toward the truck.

He freezes, squinting ahead.

He turns to run back to the porch. A sound like a cannon fires from the truck, rattling the windows, and Peter drops down beneath the window. His breath is ragged with panic.

The camera creeps back up to the window. Randall is there, lying face down in the mud. A red spot is growing on his lower back. His arms are still moving, groping, but he isnt able to drag himself. Hes reaching for the window - for Peter.

The auto-focus is shifting from the window to the curtains to Randall.

From the truck, a bear-sized man in a black fur coat takes a few limping steps into the clearing toward Randall. Hes carrying something like a 4x4 in one hand, propping it up over his shoulder.

The bear man whips the wood down through the air like an axe onto Randys skull. Peter drops down behind the window again, struggling to contain his crying.

You can hear the thumps from the club in a steady cadence, and then everything falls quiet. Even the rain pauses.

Irregular footsteps sound on the porch, then a knock at the front door, but Peter doesnt move. The doorbell sounds, pressed but not released, *ding*...

The knob slowly turns and the weather stripping creaks as the door cracks open.

*dong*

Peter sprints up the stairs. The sound of the doors glass panes shattering is drowned out by a roaring scream that isnt human. Peter bolts straight ahead, opening his parents bedroom door, and shutting it behind him, placing his back up against it.

MAMA! He screams and drops the camera.

Bare feet hang next to the bed, a few feet off the floor, a chair kicked onto its side underneath them.

The door frame splinters, and the camera is knocked under the bed, plunged into blackness.

Peter goes silent in an instant.

The sound of the killer beating him and his mother goes on and on.

The rest of the tape is of the dark, which eventually goes to blank. The whole thing is about 45 minutes long.

*Was* about 45 minutes long.

The Smiths were discovered by Ronald Preisler, still technically the owner of the house, the following day. Hed met Randy through a church conference that theyd attended together.

The car found in the woods near the base of the Smiths driveway could not be traced back to a registered owner. It was assumed to be owned by Benjamin Burns, a career truck driver whose body was found nearby, hacked to pieces with Randall Smiths wood saw, and bearing signs of blunt force trauma not consistent with a motor vehicle accident. Burnss truck was reported stolen after the fact, but was never recovered.

The body of Nicole Smith was discovered to be washed nearly a mile down a nearby stream. Hair and blood samples place her in the abandoned car near the time of the crash. The handles on the insides of both rear doors appeared to have been torn off. They were not found inside the car. However, when it was recovered, it was found that the latch was damaged in such a way that the door could not stay shut or locked.

Quincy Smith was found in the upstairs bedroom of the house. The time of death estimated to be several hours before her son Peters, whose body was found in the same room. While his cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma, hers was shown to have occurred prior to the trauma her body underwent.

Randall Smiths death was the only one thought to be a mystery, since he was charged with the murders of his other family members and Benjamin Burns. The cause of death was said to be the gunshot wound. The subsequent marks of trauma were said to be post-mortem, rendered by some unknown passerby who came across the scene.

The video tape was never entered into the police file or as evidence in the investigation. I got it almost two years ago, now. I nearly destroyed it the first time I watched it.

Instead, I hid it away in a box of video game cartridges. A box that was recently donated to a Goodwill in the next town. It wasnt there when I went to look for it. Ive gone every day and asked, but they keep telling me that they dont have it, and if they did, that someones bought it by now.

Im unbelievably sorry. But I cant tell them now.

 Up and down and side to down. 




 /r/nosleep and /r/writingprompts. The two subs I spend the most time in... 




 Kiiind of relieved that she didn't go to work on her own face, but now I've got to deal with the fact that she's over powered an adult. 




 Should it not be "realistic fiction?" 




 People. In just about every context. 




 A box of Wheaties. 




 Tim Allen and Tom Hanks wouldn't say the terrible things I hear them saying. Well, maybe Tim Allen would, but not Tom. 




 You should post a link to the pic in your post. That's allowed, right? 




 Toys are different now than when I was a kid. Everything plugs in and sings and lights up.

... At least that's what I tell myself when I hear them have conversations in the middle of the night. 




 No one is wondering where it went? The thing obviously lives in a wet environment, why would flushing it down the toilet kill it? What if it just swims back up, you go for a midnight pee and it finds its host again, this time from your bad side. 




 Welcome! Happens all the time. Good luck with your story. 




 You probably just need to make it so youre able to see NSFW posts. Normally there's a filter that blocks them. I see it, so you're good to go. 




 Thanks for the kind words. I have tentative plans to follow it up, though nothing certain. If you'd like to read more of my stuff you can at /r/test_subject4116Writes.

Thanks again for stopping by, reading and supporting one of my favorite little weird subs.

 Thanks for the Q10 recommendation. If there's a way to get it running on Linux, I'll definitely try it out. 




 Who is editing the book for you? Did you pay for the first chapter out of pocket? Will the same editor be doing the rest of the editing? What if the project doesn't get full funding? How/where do you plan on selling the paperback and what is the cost/price ratio on those compared to ebooks? 




 Read: Pay your bribes. 




 Great questions from everyone! Sorry my answers are so long.

If you want to check out the writing I've done so far, it's compiled at /r/test_subject4116Writes.

Super-duper-ooper special thanks to /u/-Faust- for taking time out of his busy schedule to put these on for us. I definitely think that the authors on nosleep right now are a special bunch and preserving them ~~in formaldehyde forever~~ this way is really special.

Any questions that didn't make it in time? Go ahead! 




 I saw that in /r/internetisbeautiful (worth subscribing to), and thought it was strangely beautiful. 




 Remember, you can go to /r/nosleepindex any time. Most series are tracked there and the butler provides weekly updates to keep you up to date on series. 




 The emergency line?! You've got to be kidding me.

Huge, mad props to /u/The_Dalek_Emperor. I think that's a huge compliment to be compared to War of the Worlds.

Also... 2 stories by the same author are the top 2 posts this month. Yeah. Big praise. 




 Can also verify. Am tin-foil hat. 




 You've got a way with words. 




 Hey and if you do find that awesome story that only has 30 votes and whose zip code was the 'controversial' tab instead of 'hot', please submit it to /r/nosleepreruns. 




 Gotta report that stuff. The mods are involved, and they will take stuff down if it's not folowing the rules.

 You're probably not even Bela Lugosi's dad.

Jesus, if I'd known that it didn't have to be real, I wouldn't have hired that serial killer; become a janitor and investigated an ancient evil; discovered surgically-produced, chemically preserved mermaids in my childhood swimming hole; given myself amnesia and implanted a tracking device in my head; turned into a girl, gone to college with a suicidal roommate and possible killer Roomba; named myself Allie, gone to Thailand and found my calling as a pistachio-eating devil in sheep's clothing who turns them into trinkets.

Fuck.

I feel so foolish right now. 




 You might have to start earlier, or suggest more of what's going on like what they stole or did to get into this situation. Even just describing them could make them a little clearer. 




 You don't happen to live near [Mammoth, Arizona](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2lvxlw/wtf_is_going_on_in_pinal_county_arizona/) do you? 




 I liked it. There's good action and pacing. The ending is nicely done. Obviously, the readers don't get to know the characters very well in this. Perhaps there's more you could do to endear them to the audience some more? 




 Dude, my next story is about robot toilets. Sh! 




 Nice one! I don't know how they could have possibly fought those things anyway...

 I've noticed a couple of themes in your stories. First, they have sort of non-characters. They seem to be there solely to react to whatever's happening like crash test dummies. From the stories I've read, I couldn't even describe them, much less explain what makes them tick.

And what makes them tick is really critical. The main character should want something - that drives nearly every story ever told. Even if they want something small, there's tension being built there.

*Inception: A Love Story* was pretty lopsided this way. The tension and suspense was all in these lines at the beginning:

I jerked my hand back and looked beside my nightstand. Kneeling there, smelling of week old bologna and malt liquor, was a man.

There's the shock - the wtf moment - and then the rest of the story is downhill from there. Why? Because I don't care about the character. The newspaper headline, "Man murdered in bed," isn't the same to you as a text from your mom saying that your father was killed by a vagrant while she was asleep beside him.

*Rats* was much better at this. The character had flaws and intricacies that humanized them. While it seemed odd that he'd go relax in a supermarket after being scared out of his own home, seeing the labrador/human/eye-bulging rat there worked well.

So as for middles... If there are interesting elements and pieces in a story, then the middle should happen on its own. Don't be afraid to let things get complicated, but once they do, just untangle that web in a straightforward, compelling way and the tension will happen, and you don't need to worry about the middle, because it's not forced. 




 Oops, sorry! I saw it there for a while but it had 0 points so I put it off. (Who downvotes a legitimate request for feedback,  btw?)

Then I noticed your username, and realized that I'd just been talking about you for your fresh prince of nosleep theme song. Which was amazing and actually made me laugh out loud.

If I run across something to help with "middles," as you call them, I'll let you know. 




 Awesome questions, all! I hope the suspense is killing you. 




 There's an "*irrational*" fear of the dark, then there's a fear of what's *in* the dark.

Right now, I'm not sure how story-like this is. It's more of a mood for the story. Especially that beginning paragraph; it's too obvious. Especially as a leading paragraph, I'd worry that readers would think "We know, we know," and scroll down past that. In a novel, it might work because you've got the room, and readers are willing to invest time, but here in short storyland... I might not include it at all, but especially not at the beginning.

So what's left?

Here, the story's switched to second-person, present tense. It's an odd, uncomfortable tense to use and it's almost impossible to make it work within the constraints of nosleep. I'd recommend not doing it in that tense if you're going to turn this into a story.

The thought of being kept up at night in bed for a fear of noises in the dark is both very classic and relatable... and also very overdone. The part about the tiny sliver of doubt creates some tension because it seems like the narrator is about to reveal something that only they know. Being able to turn on the lights kills all that tension.

As for the ending: Who would say "You may want to reach out into the dark..."? Would it be the narrator? The person who was hiding in their bed? If so, what happened to them to make them change their mind?

Sorry, but for me, this is a long way from being a story. It's more of an angle to write a story with, but fear of the dark itself is not a story. If it is, then you're holding out on us with the details!

Hope this helps. Keep writing and good luck! 




 This was nice, and I still feel like I missed some other pop references. 




 You *murderer!* 




 Unfortunately you had to vs. unfortunately you did. I'm just saying I think you may have put it in the wrong spot. 




 Just a thought: it isn't unfortunate that you leech tagged the post. Those are the rules. It's unfortunate that they haven't given anything back to the community yet - but there's still hope! 




 This made me cringe. It wasn't about the "twist" or "figuring it out." You know. You can see it from the beginning.

It's about watching OP who can't tell. It's about their willful ignorance of reality and the tension lies in how far they're going to take it - what are they going to do next?

Totally creepy. You're fucked up, OP. You need some help. 




 [I took some notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RN6x1Cmf1RxVPZgSRn-MlVro5FdpRQMesWkEu4f9Nwk/edit?usp=sharing)

It's a really good story! I can't wait to see it on nosleep. 




 First impression is that it's actually too long. It's more than bite sized. I like the twist, and the students' abuse is creepy.

I just feel like there's either a longer story here or a shorter, more powerful one. There's just too much explanation to not enough scare.

 




 That's exactly what I'd say if I were omniscient. 




 Oops. Don't post your story here, go to /r/nosleep for that.

Also, put two line breaks between paragraphs to break up your paragraphs. 




 I guess this tags along with what /u/EtTuTortilla was saying about writing for yourself.

A few months ago, I did Camp NaNoWriMo, which is basically a miniature version of the one in November. I started my novel, disregarded everything I shouldn't do while writing, consequently wrote myself straight into a corner. The whole thing was unusable. I was going to have to start from scratch if I wanted to pull anything out. But what was wprse was that I didn't even want to write it any more. I just wanted to hit mt word count and finish.

So I did the hard thing: swallowed my pride, manned up, and quit. Not only did I quit, I went to another sub and wrote another mess of a story about how I was quitting.

I was a mod of /r/writingprompts at the time, and another (better) mod, /u/DanKolar62, posted this in the comments:

 Being goal-oriented instead of self-oriented is crucial. I know so many people who want to be writers. But let me tell you, they really don't want to be writers. They want to have been writers. They wish they had a book in print. They don't want to go through the work of getting the damn book out. There is a huge difference.  James A. Michener

He didn't put it in quotes or anything, so I thought it was just him straight up calling me out until I got to the end.

It was one of those moments where that was exactly what I felt like I needed to hear at that moment. I hope that I don't forget that and sometimes I wish someone would come read over my shoulder and say "Quit your bullshit."

But then I remember that if someone had been sitting behind me this whole time, I'd be more than a little freaked out if they suddenly spoke.

The point is, I can deal with all kinds of stories written at any level, but it gets me - it offends me - when someone tries to gouge their readers with the stuff that even they don't care about. The people who make it obvious that they're churning out a product to get you to click and vote, instead of actually trying to write.

I'll forgive them for writing it, but I can't read that stuff. 




 *I* see exactly what *you're* trying to do. "Good" is a four letter word, sir.

I assume that the plant story was "right now" as in, "it's imperative that it be written this moment." Because otherwise you've got time. At least a little bit of time. 




 What? You're stopping there? You just got warmed up.

Also, you forgot to say "most violent scene **so far**."

Come on. What are you *really* going to do instead? Wouldn't it be better to get a little bit ahead for once? 




 I'll say that the last time I did this, I really wished that there was some way to keep the second post from hurting the first. I thought that the first was fine, but I also thought that I could write a sequel.

It went... okay. 




 Hey, write fucker. 




 I'm really excited to see someone like /u/Grindhorse break every single guideline and still manage to pull off a great story. 




 I did this! I did this a whole bunch actually.

Bad Atom. 




 Aaand read part 2. Awesome, awesome story. You can't beat that frame and setting for anything. 




 Try to do some research on drug use. Watch movies, read books, etc. The more you know about your content, the more naturally you'll be able to write about it. 




 I made some [edits here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vVNJu3GlCkorm4n2N8Jors07VlbxKmiLK_5_z3QeAdA/edit?usp=sharing).

There's a kernel of creepy, story-worthy tension here, but it's so buried under "blue" writing.

There's got to be some balance of investment on the part of the reader (time and trying to understand what's going on) and payoff from the story. Everything above really only covered the house (so much description of the house), introducing the characters (though only the sister, mother and main character are even in it) and stating that they saw green eyes in the forest after moving in.

I think it's just going to lose the reader with this little story progression over this amount of writing. I know in school, they tell us to be descriptive as possible, but the *real* challenge that they don't tell you about is knowing when to use it. There are very few authors who I could actively read as they described a house.

Outlining might help you out with this one. If you've got goals for each section, or even setting them for what each paragraph is supposed to accomplish in terms of moving things toward some eventual climax, I think the story might move along a little better.

Keep writing! Don't quit!

I really want to know about the green eyes! 




 Creepy story. This is one of those with a classic vibe.  




 The Artist is so damn good. 




 Holy shit. 




 Surprisingly, Coulson had the best line. 




 Right, and she would know that she wasn't trapped by a pimp, but would she really know about "most girls" in the area? 




 Child werewolf? [You inspired me.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/2l5i3c/sewer_friends/)

Great story. 




 We went down into the sewers hoping to find all the toys they'd claimed over the years. There weren't any piles of slightly-used baseballs or brave, flood-riding plastic ships. All there was was stink and rot and mold. Our parents were right.

So far.

Further along the tunnel, we heard skittering ahead; claws on wet cement. From the inky, humming blackness and into the beams of our flashlights bounded a beautiful silver-haired puppy. We were rescuers; heroes. And we loved him.

Thomas and I fought over who would get to keep the dog. We couldn't tell our parents of course. Tom was bigger than me, and he won the first night. Shep went with him.

He wasn't at church the next morning. His parents were upset with mine. He'd told them that he was staying the night at my house.

When I got home, I changed out of my clean clothes and dashed into the woods. He'd be at our fort, a tarp-made-tent under the low boughs of a big pine.

Tom's blood was everywhere, but he was nowhere to be found. Drag marks through the sandy soil led toward the road and I followed them. Fresh footprints lined the way. The grown-ups were probably already looking for him.

The trail ended at the mouth of the sewer. I found Tom's body lying inside the open grate. Something had eaten him. Bones and clothes.

"I had fun with you," said a child's lisping voice behind me. "We all liked your friend. Momma says when the moon's big I can be your Shep again." 




 Hey what an... interesting story.

The first line was a little jarring. "At that age" isn't explained, or obvious because there isn't any context yet.

There's just *so. much. detail.* that doesn't really **need** to be there. You could probably cut 25% of the sentences in this and tell the exact same story. I'll be up front and say that I didn't love it, but that's how most of your readers are going to feel about it. I came in cold, and going through the kids organizing the wedding, performing the wedding, a description of how to play Red Rover, them playing it...

It's a slow build. I appreciate that, but these things don't serve to build the tension, they're really just filler.

The narrator was possibly the best part. It stayed consistent and really revealed the thought process of the kids really well. The only line that didn't work for me was the one about Humpty Dumpty, which felt cliched and less profound or interesting than it could have been.

The twist at the end was definitely strange. It leaves so many questions. I almost think that the story could have been better without it. It's almost like the story goes from ABC and the ending was point H.

Overall I think it has potential, but these things made me lose my interest and my overall impression was that a lot of it was words-for-words-sake. With a good edit, I'd like to see it again, on nosleep or somewhere else. 




 I'll throw in some thoughts just to be contrary to what the others have said.

In something this short that's truly flash fiction, you've got to take shortcuts. There isn't time or space to really develop anything, so you've got to use loaded language. 

In "Lick," the story is scary because the reader puts themselves in the place of the narrator. Nothing is developed about that character, but the reader substitutes something they already know to fill in that massive blank. Buddy is the dog that everyone's had or met at one point. It doesn't require any explanation. That's effective, but delicate.

The obvious problem with this piece is that it's unoriginal. Aside from the spelling (lower case "i") and grammatical errors (the first sentence is a run-on, the last sentence is in a different tense than the others), I might have thought that this *was* the original. 




 The story starts with "Once upon a time..." and keeps that tone throughout. I'm not sure that it's believable enough for nosleep the way it is right now, but it's got some strong points that make it so that it might work somewhere else.

One good thing is that it doesn't shy away from the subject matter, which is just about as dark as it gets. I almost didn't want to read it, it was so dark.

Everything is stated so matter-of-factly, actually, that it runs into that territory of being hard to understand who the narrator is supposed to be. Things are extremely black and white, like bullet-point facts (look at how many sentences are basically X did Y. X did Z.), and some of them don't make sense for any one person to know. Especially since the ending reveals that the narrator is one of the johns. How would he know that "she was one of the few girls on the street who didn't get trapped by a pimp," for example? 

Reality is rarely so cut and dry, but it almost works in this fairy tale setting. The only thing is that there should maybe be less of it, with more substantiation, and more left up to the reader's imagination.

The main character's development arc is a little crooked. She seems invincible, and smart and perfect in every way. It breaks the tension. She has to be vulnerable and human sometimes or it's not exciting. Along the same lines, so much of the story revolves around the need for money and what people will do for even $1000, but when she becomes an "Avenger" (not fond of the title) and is able to track down men and kill them around the world. Sometime in the middle of that, she decides to be a plumber.

Then we get to the end, and find out that the narrator is actually an old man. I liked the twist, actually, but I can't really feel bad for the character, and I also didn't feel scared of the fate he had coming his way. Maybe he shouldn't have been a perv in the first place. He's *so* unlikeable that he's hardly human. He's flat, in terms of character development, a cookie-cutter villain like the others.

Don't stop writing! Good luck.

 I live on the 34th floor of my 60-story apartment building.

Above the 29th floor, they give you a discount on your rent each month to offset the inconvenience of the elevator occasionally going out.

As such, I found myself hauling at least 40 pounds of groceries up 33 flights of stairs on a Saturday. Ever notice how the stair wells in buildings always look unfinished? Like, the builders spent all their time and energy on the rest of the interior of the building and then got to the stairway and just said Fuck it.

My footsteps echoed all around the unfinished cement-and-metal chamber. I wasnt alone. Others passed me every few flights, heading in the other direction. I was worried that theyd see me sweating. The groceries pulled my arms and the insides of my shoulders were beginning to feel like Silly Putty.

I was at the 33rd, and a couple of young 20-somethings that lived down the hall from me were passing on my left. I was forced next to the railing so that they could pass. I looked down the center of the stairwell, and the drop was dizzying. Something fist-sized and black smacked against the back of my head from above and continued down the drop. I recoiled in pain and surprise and dropped the groceries so that I could rub the painful goose-egg forming on the crest of my skull.

What was that? Krista asked, trying to stop some of my groceries from rolling all the way down the steps. Are you okay?

Her boyfriend Mark was charging up the stairs shouting loudly. Someone upstairs was shouting Morty! Im sorry!

Oh man. That fucking hurt. It felt like the area that had been struck was bleeding pretty badly, but when I pulled my hand away it was covered in stringy red-tinted clear slime. What the-?

The man from upstairs had pushed his way past Mark and ran past us. Morty! Im coming! Are you okay?

What the fuck! I yelled as he stomped on my eggs and bread strewn about the landing.

Mark asked Are you okay? and he and Krista helped me pick up my groceries and carry them into my apartment.

Thanks guys. Im okay, I think, I said. I was feeling especially tired, but my scalp had mostly stopped hurting.

What was that guys doing? What an asshole. You think he dropped his phone or something?

Yeah, I think Ive seen that guy before. Hes totally weird and reclusive. He lives next to Beth on the 42nd.

Mark put out his arms theatrically like he was trying to catch a football. Moorty!

Yeah yeah. Thanks again guys. We gotta get together sometime soon. I owe you.

Okay, yeah. No problem. Hope youre okay.


My legs gave out as the door closed, and I sat on my couch. I was so tired I could hardly keep my eyes open. In seconds, I was asleep. My last thought before drifting off was that Id left the milk on the counter with the rest of the groceries.

I woke up feeling hotter than the sun, pouring sweat from every part of my body. My jeans felt painfully tight and restrictive. I raised my hand and tried to stand up and witnessed that my fingers had become large, pink sausages. My entire body looked as if it had been inflated.

I stumbled with dumb, unbending legs to the bathroom. My swollen body could barely fit through the door. I caught a glimpse of something in the mirror. It could not have been *me*. Surely it was some kind of monster. I reached up to touch my hair - recently dyed with red highlights. The power went out and I was plunged into blackness. The hair stayed in my hand, coming away from my head in a mess of slime that wouldnt come off.

My phone was trapped in my tiny jeans. The belt had sunken into the mass of flesh around my waist and I wasnt able to get to it.

I stumbled out into the lightless hall, and knocked on Krista and Marks door before feeling my way to the stairwell. Red emergency lights revealed a large black snail the size of a softball slowly working its way along the railing.

The stairs were incredibly hard to maneuver. With each step I actually worried that my tensioned skin would tear and burst. The heat was overwhelming and it was hard to breathe through my swollen throat. My eyes had become puffy and cut my vision to slits. Someone fell from above me and screamed as they fell down the middle of the stairwell, hitting railings and bouncing back and forth all the way down.

I made it to the 42nd and pushed in the door. Beths door was the second from the stairs on the left side of the hall. My foot came down on dozens of snails, each step causing a sickly, thunderous crunch. They were coming from the apartment next to Beth's. I pounded on the door with my fists, but they were so soft it hardly made a sound. I kicked it with my shoe and felt my ankle burst, hot fluid pouring out onto my foot. I fell and felt the snails pointed, jagged shells moving under my hands.

The door opened, and sunlight streamed in through the windows behind a swollen figure. They got out! Oh god, I let them out! I went after Morty when he fell down the stairs and left the cage open!

He was screaming. I could see the shells sticking out of his skin, the entire heads of the snails having burrowed inside down to the bone.

We screamed as they ate us. Slowly - at a snails pace. It was all we could do.

Then I woke up on my couch. The power outage had caused the thermostat to reset and the inside of my apartment was roasting. I turned it down to 71 degrees and put the rest of the groceries away. 




 Stop it, you guys are making me hungry. 




 *Piggybacon*. Butler's got jokes. 




 Great work, Butler! 




 Maybe it's just because the subject was in the Navy, and the story was told from the point of view of the psychiatrist, but this reminded me of [The USS Eldridge](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1e923u/uss_eldridge/) 




 Oh yeah reddit won't let you paste italics from somewhere else. 




 Overall, I thought it was a decent story. It doesn't wander too far, and stays mostly focused on the action which is good. There are a lot of little mechanical errors and faux pas which are distracting. It just really needs a good edit, where at least 30% of the lines could be cut out.

The cut scenes/flashbacks are so distracting. I tried to put in line breaks where I found them.

The biggest thing that I saw was trying to keep the immersion. Allow your characters to act like people and to react to what's around them. The narrator was inconsistent - sometimes it was the girl, sometimes it was omniscient. Some of the dialogue was clunky and action-movie-esque.

There's a good story here, but some work needs to be done to really get it out. 




 The banging stops.  A low growl comes through.  But you cant stop me from taking her.  I bury my face in moms jacket.  

What are you? I shriek out.  It hammers on the door again.  Answer me.  Why won't you leave us alone?

Hard to shriek out with a face buried in someone's clothes.

Molly get downstairs now, this is your final warning.  

Moms finger hits the trigger.  The gunshot is a cannonade that ruptures my eardrums.  I scream with it.  The banging stops.

"Cannonade" is an awesome word to use here. Ruptured ear drums are an actual thing that can happen. If they "erupted in pain" or something, then that's one thing, but the main character doesn't appear to actually go deaf after this point.

I didn't get her mom whispers.  I didn't get her, I didn't get her.

The door visibly caves in on its hinges.  OHMYGOD! I duck back into cover.  Please tell me theres another way out of here.

What kind of pistol was this that caved in a door?

No.  Mom shakes me a little.  Hey little one, whatever comes through that door we're going to have to face it, okay?  She plants a warm kiss on my forehead.  Stay strong.

I cant.

This is your final warning Molly.  The window above us shatters.  Something long and black comes through and grabs mom, ripping her out of my arms.  She screams and flails, I lung[e] and grab at her.   

There was a window? Why weren't they trying to escape through it?

Mommy, no!  Then shes gone, and I'm sobbing alone.  

The doors lock finally gives way.  I crawl into the corner and cower around my little knife.  It swings open unevenly, the damage to its hinges prevents smooth movement.  A tall figure steps inside.  Hey Molly a familiar voice says.  I look up slowly.  No way.  

Door frames are usually made of wood and tend to give much sooner than locks and hinges. What caused the damage to the door?

Dad?  He steps around the bed and stands over me, smiling like he used to before the fights started.  

Hey little one.  You okay there?  He offers a hand.  

Wheres mom? I demand.  

Lets not worry about that, we'll get her back.  He strokes my hair.  A warm tingling runs down my back.  

Will we?  

We will, promise.  I take his hand and he pulls me to my feet.  I'm so weak and frail compared to his massive muscled bulk.  He hugs me with more gentleness than Id expect from someone of his size, but I dont feel comforted.  

---

Im in the shower, when theres a click of the lock turning.  Hey!

---

Were getting you out of here kiddo.  He takes my hand and leads me downstairs.  Im his princess again.  We head out into the hall and downstairs, where the lights are now on.  My living room looks so safe and friendly.  

Screw this, Im calling the cops.  Wheres my phone? I ask.

Weird transition from "It all looked safe and friendly," to "Screw it, I'm calling the cops."

Ive got it.  He grins at me.  

---

Dads immense figure steps into the bathroom, masked by steam.  Uhh dad, you know Im in the shower, right?

Oh I know.

---

I grab at my head.  Where was that memory from?  Dads hand feels like its burning against mine, I want it gone.

So what happens now? I ask.

He grins at me.  Im taking you away.  You'll be safe.  He leads me to the front door.  Theres another person dressed in black and red out there.

Is he dressed in black and red too? 

---

Dad sweeps aside the curtain.  I let out a shriek and cower away.  Dad what are you doing?  He grabs me and pulls me towards him[.]

Just relax princess, everythings going to be okay.["]

---

I drop to my knees in shock, his hand leaves mine.  Why couldn't I remember that before?  Oh my god, I feel so disgusting, he  I begin to shiver and try to block out the ensuing image, but it just overflows the dam and races through my mind.  How could I let him do [that] to me and forget it?  I cant go with him, hes giving me that same grin.  

You okay there? he asks, smiling like hes my actual father.  

I need to get out of here.  I can't get out the front door and whoevers outside will just run me down if I go for the back.  That leaves me with going back upstairs.  I remember my computer in my room, with a lock on the door.  I feel around below his gaze.  Moms knife is tucked in my waistband.  It easily comes free.  Why do you want me?  I ask.

Because youre my daughter and I love you.

You shouldn't[.] I'm a real bitch once you get to know me.  I leap up and stab him.  The blade sinks into his soft knee knee and lodges deep in the muscle and bone.  He lets out a yell like a wounded lion and collapses.  I take off running back through our house.  His friend chases after me, feet thundering faster than mine.  I hit the stairs and leap up them three at a time, then swing right and slam my door.  The deadbolt snaps into place.  

"...his soft knee knee" tee hee.

"I leap up and stab him." But you stab him in the knee, where you didn't even need to leap up. Also, you repeat "leap up" when you get to the stairs.

Open the door! Mom yells.  

No!  I grab my computer and open it.  My hands are shaking so hard it takes three tries to bring up Skype.  It dials Kelseys number.  Please answer please answer please answer.  The screen flashes to show her, half asleep.  Kelsey, call the police right now! I scream.  The door begins to buckle.

Whats going on Molly? she mumbles.

Two guys broke into my house, they have my phone and mom.  Please hurry!  

Her eyes go wide.  Okay!  She yanks out her phone and dials.  Hello, police?  My friend needs you.  Shes at Four Willow Drive.  She says someone broke into her house, Im looking at her on my Skype someones trying to break down her door.  Hurry!  Her eyes go to the door slowly giving way.  Hang on Molly!  

Fuck this I'm killing this bitch! a low voice snarls.  

Leave me alone dad! I cry.  He doesnt reply.  You're my father, you're supposed to take care of me and protect me.  Why don't you understand?" I hear a gunshot.  Something brushes against my leg.  I look down, Im bleeding from a gash across my calf.  

The last time you heard a gunshot it was a "cannonade," this time you just heard it.

Molly, are you okay? Kelsey begs me.

No.  One of the door hinges comes flying off.  They're breaking through, I have to go.  I run to the window and yank it open while she screams behind me.  Cold November air rushes through, shocking my lungs and driving frozen talons into my body.  I clamber out onto the window sill and turn around.  The door splinters apart and dad comes through.  A feral snarl is on his face and his fingers are grasping for my throat.  I let myself fall backwards.  The window rushes away, air blowing through hair.

Theres a pop and my leg explodes with pain.  I scream for the umpteenth time that night, and my vision goes white.  Reality returns after a few seconds.  I'm flat on my back, can't move my right leg for the agony coursing through it.  Its twisted unevenly under my body.  I have to get out of here, the cops aren't going to make it.  

*Crawl.  Your leg will heal if you live, fucking crawl.* 

Hand over hand I drag myself across my front lawn.  A blue SUV that I've never seen before is sitting outside our front yard.  Ill hide beneath it until the police get here.  I'm almost there, I'll be safe.

Wouldn't the SUV belong to them in that case? I'm not even sure that hiding under a car in this case would work.

Someone kicks me over onto my back, sending waves of pain running down my leg.  Dads face appears inches from mine, eyes bulging and sweat running down his brow.  Dad, why won't you just leave me alone.  I loved you and this is all you did to me.  

His fingers tighten around my throat until I can't breathe.  I kick beneath him and smack at his face but hes immovable, smiling in satisfaction even.  My arms grow weak, my lungs feel like they are going to burst.  I spasm uncontrollably beneath his vice, anything to get him off me before he kills me.  Theres a tunnel forming in my vision, just his terrifying face is left.  

*Too late, I'm sorry Kelsey.*

A gunshot echoes in the distance and suddenly his hands are gone and I'm gasping for air.  Dad stands up, blood leaking from a hole in his chest.  A fusillade of shots rings out, and he folds up on himself.  His body lands [on top of] me, and my vision finally goes black.

---

I'm lying in a hospital bed, my leg in a brace and a line hooked up to my wrist.  Its so cold and dark in here, I might as well be back outside.  Im curled beneath the blankets in my fluffy pink pajamas and some warm stockings, but Im still shivering.  Moms dead, the police found her lying beneath her window with her throat slit.  They wanted me to identify the body until a nurse yelled at them, a syringe in one hand.  I dont want to get up, ever. 

A voice murmurs in the distance.  Then more voices, getting closer.  I instinctively tense and curl up the best I can to avoid them.  Let me see her! Kelsey[s] scream cuts through them.  Get out of the way, let me see my girl!  I open my eyes and roll over.  Kelsey leaps onto my bed and throws her arms around me.

Hey! a doctor yells and runs into the room.  I hug her back as tight as I can.  This time no ones pulling her away from me.  Kelsey stares at me with wide eyes.  

Poor Molly.  Its going to be okay.  She kisses me on either cheek and presses her smooth forehead against mine.  We form a nice little pocket of warmth together.  Howre you doing? she asks.

My heart accelerates.  They cant hurt me anymore, I am unbreakable.  Molly nods.  

No they cant.  They cant break us.  We curl up together, safe against the monsters.   




 I curl up in my bed, my head pounding and body shaking.  My sheets are soaked in my sweat.  I can only hope that he doesnt find me.  Im only eleven, little girls dont get murdered, do they?

It struck me as being unlikely that an eleven-year-old would consider themself to be a "little girl."

---

Molly, whatever happens youll always have me.  Promise.  My best friend Kelsey smiles at me through my computer screen.  Shes so sincere I try to grab her and accidentally slap the screen.  I laugh sheepishly and the effort hurts my chest.  Kelsey rolls her eyes and giggles.  [Were pretty similar people, physically at least.  Im about five seven with brown eyes, smooth auburn hair that I like to wear a bow in, and a lot of freckles that seem to make everyone think Im adorable despite my closing in on sixteen years old. Kelseys two inches shorter and mousey, with similar straight hair and freckles.]

The appearances are a bit of an information dump. They don't have any bearing on the story yet so they don't feel natural here. It's jarring to read and breaks immersion.  

Thanks Kelsey.  I dont know what to do, Livy says that shes going to kick me off the cheerleading squad if I tell anyone she was shooting up.  I cant just let her destroy herself like that though.  I curl up on my bed.  [Its around ten oclock but Im still dressed in my blue skirt, pink sweater, and black tights that I wore to school today.  Kelseys in her ratty old sweatshirt and ready for bed.  Shes usually out by eleven while I linger on past three.]

More info dump related to appearance.

I cant deal with this anymore Mom sobs.  Dad is still screaming away upstairs, the house shakes as he punches a wall wall.  I climb up from the table Id been hiding under and throw my arms around her waist.  Thanks baby.  She doubles over and buries her face in my shoulder.

In the first paragraph you mentioned being curled up in bed, now you're under a table. Would the house actually shake if he punched a wall?

Why cant we be a normal family? I ask.  I dont understand, why cant mom and dad just get along?  Why does dad scream at me for every little thing I do wrong?

Rhetorical questions don't translate as well to this kind of storytelling. Every time the narrator directly tells something to the audience, it takes the reader out of the scene. Basically, it's distracting.

I dont know baby.

---

Look.  Its clearly hurting Livy, she used to be the nicest girl on the squad and now shes a bitch.  But you can't help everyone.  Just leave her alone and see what happens, we can't help everyone.

Are you sure?

Kelsey sighs and frowns; saying this hurts her as much as it hurts me to hear it.  Yes, I know it sucks but I don't think trying to help her is going to end well.  Her decision, her problem.

---

Dad comes down stairs.  He sees his suitcase sitting flap limply open atop his tangled clothes.  I smile at him hopefully.  His eyes widen, skin goes bright red.  MOLLY!

---

Okay.  I press my face against my laptops keyboard.  Its nice and warm against the cold November air that get in because mom doesn't have the money to raise the thermostat above [sixty] and re-caulk the windows.  Once again Im saying goodbye to someone I love.  Panic rushes through me as I recall my list of people Ive left.  Livy used to be our friend, everyone I know is leaving!

Sixty degrees is really low. The main character goes from "Okay" to panic in a split second without much explanation as to why.

Kelsey sees where this is going and cuts me off [n]o theyre not, we love you.  Just remember me, and all the other girls on the squad, we love you.  Okay?  

I'm hanging onto her like Ill fall off a cliff if I let go.  Okay.  

---

I love you, but I have to go dad said.  He couldnt even look me in the eyes as he zipped his bag back up.  I stepped between him and the door.  

Wasn't he red-faced and screaming? What happened to calm him down?

Im not letting you leave dad, were a family I cried.  He shook his head and shoved me.  Actually shoved me, I hadnt expected it and I went down ha[r]d, smacking my head on the floorboards.  Mom screamed and ran over.  Despite the pain racing through my skull, my eyes were still on dad, as he slid out the door and slammed it behind him.

---

Moms hoarse voice wafts through my door.  Molly, come downstairs.  

Thats mom, gotta go I say.

See you in the morning, love you.  Kelsey smiles and waves, exposing dimples.

I grin at her until she closes her computer.  Then I do the same and with a sigh clamber out of my comfy bed.  I head out the single hallway that makes up the second floor of my house.  The walls are plastered with cracked white linoleum and the blue carpet is flat from use.  Molly!  Shes downstairs, probably staring at something I left where I shouldn't have.

Coming mom! I jog to the stairs.  Someone grabs me from behind before I can leap down them.  Theres no one else in the house.  Hey! I shriek and whirl around-to see mom standing over me, tall and worn from life and still in her business suit.  Mom, whats going on?  

"There's no one else in the house" tells the audience something that only an omniscient narrator would know, but the narrator is supposed to be the main character. Would the main character know for certain that no one else was home? Would they doubt themselves if they heard someone else?

"still in her business suit" is not something that I would have thought to mention in a fearful situation like having someone else inside the house. As the reader, I just don't care about this, I care about what's going on, and I feel like the main characters should too.

Shhh.  She puts a hand over my mouth.  

Her voice calls from below.  Molly, come downstairs right now.  I leap, my heart freezes in my chest.  I turn back around and stare into the pitch darkness of our downstairs.  

Im going to call the police, stay with me Mom whispers into my ear.  I nod frantically.  

Something moves at the foot of the stairs.  Molly! I leap back, slamming into her.  

This is a really nice play on the impersonator story.

Into my room! mom says.  She grabs my shoulders and we run down the corridor to her room at the end.  Mom shoves me through and slams the door after us, locking it.  We're trapped[,] in her small bedroom with no protection beyond that flimsy door.

Comma not required.

Molly!  

My hair stands on end.

You want to separate these two things to show that they're coming from separate characters.

Oh my god, what is that?

We need to call [nine one one], my phones downstairs[,] wheres yours?  I search through my pockets.  

9-1-1 is the typical way of writing this.

No I whisper.

"Where is...?" isn't answered by "No."

Oh no.  I hear a steady thumping running up the stairs.  Mom[,] its coming!  The footsteps race down the hallway towards us.

It feels like a lot of time has passed since the narrator has focused on a lot of small details. If it's "racing," shouldn't it have been there already?

I know.  She runs over to the [k]night table and  opens the drawer.  I follow her, because it feels safer to be by her side than anywhere else.  A small black pistol that I'd never seen before appears in her hand.  A small knife appears in her other.  I got these in case

Is "appears" the best verb for this situation? It's repeated twice, but it's not even actually what's happening.

In case dad? I ask.  I never stopped hoping he'd come back, I guess mom did.  I can't blame her.  

Yes.  She shoves the knife into my hands.  Were going to have to stay here until morning.  Do you think you can use that?  She winks at me, trying to be confident.

I hold it awkwardly in my hands.  Rule number one, stick them with the pointy end?  She grins and nods.  

This seems unrealistic that they'd be joking with each other while they're in a potentially life-or-death situation.

BAM the door rattles on its hinges.  A scream shoots through my lips before I can stop it and mom jumps.

"Racing" and yet several lines of dialogue go past before it arrives at the end of the hall.

Molly, I wanted you in the kitchen ten minutes ago, get down there right this instant!  

You should probably explicitly make mention that this is your mother's voice.

Mom grabs me and cradles me to the floor.  She aims the gun at the door with an arm thats shaking like a leaf in the breeze.  

You cant have her! mom yells shrilly.  I snuggle up under the crook of her elbow and wrap my arms around her.  It cant take me if I dont let go.  
 




 Dude, you're not burying it for long enough to get a nice patina. Really bury it and water it every day, then dig it up. 




 I was a big fan of the older games, which introduced me as a kid to the whole post-apocalyptic genre in such a cool way. I'd thought that the series had died out, and then they made F3. Such awesome games that hold a lot of sentimental value for me. 




 I know. That's why I wrote it for you. 




 I don't think that I was - or am - anything special. As you said, I didn't do anything. I just had a bigger monster than Alan in my corner. 




 Ssso good.

# Calling

The next afternoon I called Ben and asked him to meet me for lunch. He showed up twenty minutes late and double parked his car. In the daylight I could see the scratches left over from his late-night drunken joyrides. I was glad he'd made it home in one piece last night.

When he walked in, I tried my best to act like I was excited to see him. It was very important that he like me. He was visibly confused. I told him that I'd had fun catching up with him last night. He didn't apologize for trying to kiss me so I did for not letting him. He seemed interested again after that.

I told him I wanted to hang out more today, and tried to work in a joke about how we're both unemployed now. He even laughed, despite clearly not getting that he was the butt of the joke. He was content to live off his father's money doing whatever he wanted every day. How could that ever be a bad thing?

"Oh! I almost forgot. Could you go with me to this one place downtown? There's this creepy guy who works there, and I'd really like to have a guy there with me. Just in case." Ben agreed.

I had to work desperately not to run out of things to talk about as we walked. We got to the shop and he let out a groan of frustration. "Antiquing is fucking lame."

"Oh, it won't take long. I just want to see if I can make a trade. Then maybe we can go somewhere... *private.*" From the sleazy smile on his face I saw that I had him again.

The For Sale sign was gone from the front of the shop now. The windows were full of trinkets and dusty items - a bicycle, a throwing star, a silverware set... Nothing about the place looked new, in fact it looked like a store that had always been there. If I hadn't seen it empty just last night, I wouldn't have believed it.

I didn't see Alan inside, though the podium was in the same place it had been at the store in Pattaya. I made Ben go inside first, following closely behind.

I still loved the store, as wrong as that sounds. Each item might actually be akin to a little imprisoned person sitting on a psychopath's shelf... but God damn it if they're not interesting.

Alan came around the corner from the back room. His customary smile was noticeably absent. His eyes, heterochromial green and blues, glared into me. 

"What's this? New guests? Please, come in. I'm sure you'll find what you need..."

Ben looked at me to carry on with what I needed to do, but something on the shelves caught his eye on one of the back shelves. Alan took his place behind the podium, and I went to speak with him.

"You can't have the watch," out of Ben's earshot.

"I thought that you might say something like that..."

"It's mine. I've had it since I was a child and it's not for sale."

"Miss, you've already agreed to the terms. The deal has been made, and I'm afraid that there's nothing that I can do."

"Yes. There is... Take him." I tilted my head toward Ben. He hadn't moved from the spot, apparently entranced by something that I couldn't quite see.

At this, Alan's wicked smile came back. "An interesting wager. I'm afraid that it's not something that's yours to give, however."

"Why not? He came willingly. Take him instead, and leave me alone. Forever."

Alan hissed through his crooked lower teeth and studied the former jock. "I'm sorry to disappoint you. In order for the transformation to occur... well, suffice to say that it's very difficult, and requires quite a bit of investment on my behalf. A lump of coal does not have the same value as a diamond,  you understand."

"What if I could brought you another diamond?"

The man's eyes narrowed to slits. Thousands of little wrinkles ran together to darken the skin around his eyes. He looked angry, but there was something else in his reaction too. Curiosity.

"You've got no way to deliver such a promise. It's taken me hundreds of years to perfect the art."

I had him on his heels. He wanted it. "I've done it before."

He broke eye contact with me for the first time, and held his jaw in one bony hand in consideration of my offer. After a tense moment, he put both hands on the podium. "A *most* unusual offer. I must say that I am very intrigued. Our deadline still stands, but I will accept another object suitable for my collection in place of the watch. *If* you are able to procure one."

"Deal."

"Not so fast. If you're not here by dawn, I'll have to perform a repossession. You understand. The watch will be mine of course, but I'll also have you." He was visibly excited as he said this. "A most interesting customer."

"Fine."

I could feel Alan's grin on my back as I made my way over to Ben. He still hadn't moved even an inch since I'd started talking with Alan. Not even breathing.

"Ben? Ready to go?"

He started as if I'd just found him daydreaming on the job. Then he was back to his normal, abnoxious self. 

---

It was late afternoon when we got to the Boy Scout camp. Dark clouds hung heavy in the sky, blocking out the sun. A chain and padlock held the gates shut tight, so Ben parked his car on the gravel road and we walked in.

The camp looked the same as it had when I'd been there as a kid, except it all felt smaller, the trees,, lower. It felt like a place that I'd outgrown. When we came into view of the dock, I remembered my fantasy as a kid where the kids would throw me out into the lake. I suppose I *was* trespassing but for some reason the fear felt childlike and silly.

"Where the hell are we going?" Ben finally asked.

"Just ahead. I want to see something." We were passing the central mess hall, the hub in the center of the tiny cabins.

I'd turned around to talk to Ben, and as I faced forward again, I saw it. 

The tree was gone. In its place was a small, round gazebo-style building with a cloth roof and wood sides. On every side of the building was nothing but bare sand in a wide circle. Even a hundred feet away from the dead spot I heard the silence. It was like dunking your head in cool, still water and letting it fill your ears. 

I hopped down the last of the dirt trail. This was it. I could still feel it.

It was calling.

The door was unlocked and swung open easily. "Uh, I'm not going in there," said Ben.

"Not going in? Why not? Don't make me go alone," I pouted. "Come on. It'll be fun."

Inside, I could still see the tree. It was there, holding up the center of the canvas ceiling. The limbs had been trimmed and the structure had been built around it, but there was no mistaking the stark white trunk. I was so close.

"I don't know what you're into, but you've been acting like a crazy bitch all day. First you call me up like you want to hook up, then you take me to that weird shop, and now you take me out into the fucking woods."

"So? I thought you were having fun."

"Well, I mean... not really. This place is weird. It gives me the creeps."

"Sorry, I thought you'd be into this. You're right. I've been acting totally weird and this was a crazy idea. I just wanted to impress you, that's all. Forget itl. Let's go back."

He shrugged his arms like a petulant child and turned around in front of me. Beside the path, I spotted a branch that had dropped from a nearby tree. Ben was hiking back up the trail, his soft disposition was taking its toll. He couldn't even pay attention to me as I picked up the branch. It was thick and heavy and not so old as to have bugs living inside or its rigidness eroded.

A quick crack across the back of his head sent him rolling to the ground.

---

I sat on the front steps of the gazebo. Inside, I could hear the sounds of Ben just beginning to come to. In another moment he would realize that I'd used the scouts' spare rope to tie him to the base of the tree. I imagine that he'd start yelling, but as I looked out across the lake at the unoccupied summer homes, I felt confident that the noise would die out long before it reached the ears of another person.

I had no idea how long this would take. For the first time today, with nothing to do, doubt began to creep into my mind. I absently watched the wispy fog blowing along the surface of the lake and turned the silver pocket watch over in my fingers. Feeling its familiar smooth surface was relaxing.

I flipped it open and saw the young girl bobbing in the intricate mechanical waves. 7:30. I still had time... but what would happen if I stayed all night and nothing came? What if nothing happened? What if I was wrong about this whole thing?

The watch slipped through my fingers and landed in the dead sand below. Seeing it there reminded me of when I'd vomited the watch onto the floor of the 7-Eleven along with the pistachio shells. I had to chuckle at the thought. Somehow I'd outsmarted the owner of All In Good Time by smuggling it out in my stomach. It was like something from a video game or a movie. The whole world felt as if it had gone crazy.

I just wished that I could remember the deal that I made, or anything else about that time. Why would I ever agree to something like that? And poor Mark; held to his deal which led to his death. One night of fun in exchange for a life.

Alan wouldn't be getting the watch.

Not tonight.

Not from me.

The watch was warm to the touch when I picked it up, almost hot. Heat felt like it was emanating from the sand below.

"Hey! Is someone out there? Help! Help me! In here!" Ben was yelling. He could probably feel it too. It was getting hotter.

Light shone out through the woods. The hum of an engine and car tires, shocks squealing, and pine needles, dirt clods and gravel were being kicked up onto the bottom of the car. I was anything but surprised when I saw the shape of the white convertible Mustang come into the clearing. It was the only sound, intruding through the deep silence.

Alan stepped out, his suit now blacker than the dark woods behind him, somehow appearing to suck the light out of the air around him. His eyes matched, giving the impression of the man wearing a mask with empty sockets where the eyes should be.

As he walked forward and his wide predator's smile came into my view, the wood of the gazebo groaned beside me. Ben was screaming now.

"The deal's off, Alan!" I shouted. He hadn't entered the circle, but was pacing carefully around the dead perimeter.

"No, Allie... I disssagree." The smile was still on his face, but it wasn't human, the same as the way that he held on to the 's.'

"You can't have it, Alan. It's mine." My voice cracked nervousness.

"You've got no idea what you're toying with, girl." His leather shoe stepped on the line. The little building around the tree's foundation sank. It seemed to be falling apart. Wind swirled my hair in all directions.

"You can't control thisss. You should have jussst given me what I came for."

"You mean this?" I held out the watch, letting it dangle from its chain.

"No. You."

Alan lunged forward and made an animal growl. A huge tearing sound came from inside the gazebo and Ben finally fell silent. Another step and the boards and tarp over the tree were spinning as if they'd been caught in a tornado. The collector was ten feet away. Before he got to five, the earth around us was pitching and shaking, the sand floating through the air. Just as he was upon me, I felt myself lifted upwards.

Around and around we went, the whole area appearing to have been stuffed into a blender. The white Mustang soared up past me, just narrowly avoiding colliding with me. The gazebo had been reduced to scraps of wood. In the darkness I couldn't find Alan.

Far below, in the center of it all stood the white tree, raising out of a circular hole in the ground. The barren tree was growing, its branches spreading and multiplying like a network of bleached veins reaching into the air.

I reached out for the slended branches, and caught hold of one. The next moment, everything was still. All the debris in the air began tumbling straight back toward the earth. The Mustang, from hundreds of feet up, bellyflopped into the lake with a huge splash.

Climbing down from the now massive tree took a full quarter of an hour. More than once I felt like I nearly lost my grip on the slick, white, barkless wood. Near the base I found Ben, still tied to the tree and unconscious. It was for the best that he hadn't seen everything that had happened.

I finally let myself feel the backed up, putrid feelings about myself for getting him involved. He hadn't deserved it, and I knew that I'd never be able to explain any of it. I'd used him, plain and simple, as bait. I knew that Alan's greed would lead him out here - that he couldn't stand having competition. It had ultimately been his undoing. But I'd needed a simple person to manipulate and Ben had stumbled into the role perfectly last night at the bar.

I untied Ben and dragged him out of the sandy, now sunken hole which was slowly filling with lake water. He'd live. He'd wake up confused and wander out of here on his own. Hopefully he'd just forget about the whole thing.

I hopped back down into the pit and searched around. It didn't take long to find, lying half-buried in the sand. A name tag: ALAN.

Tomorrow, I'll go back to the store. It's all mine, now.

I feel like I finally found my calling, like I've found what I'm supposed to do. I never thought that it would come from a trip to Thailand.

But then again, I didn't really find it after all. It found me.
 




 How?

I understand the story, and the people and how the plot perfectly falls together like the cogs in the old paddleboats lazing through the water in Old Town like dried, puckered gals doing the backstroke. That part makes sense. It might actually be that simple, which is why, in a sub like this one, sometime after the midnight moonlighters are gone, when you finally come across the kind of post that sucks you in with toy plastic red lipstick and might as well have "one too many" written across her *tit*le, that you don't see it coming. The twist of a single word leading you astray at the first nibble when it's already too late because you got the barb through your mouth. The whole time you've been thinking that you're the big fish, only to find that you're really the hook who didn't catch. You've been along for the ride, watching the bait and the prey doing their mating killing dance when really it's the bit of rusted steel that, with a twist, is about to be jerked out of the whole situation only to have to admit that "I was too close to see it," before being tossed back into the mausoleum-cum-tacklebox with a thousand others just like you.

So how'd you do it, Tortilla? How'd you write this story so damn well given that godawful title?
