 I wonder if the FBI wallets and badges will be updated with up to date photos or will Mulder and Scully use the ones they did on the original intro, I would love a copy or two 




 So we getting CSI meets paranormal then 




 Yeah but comics go where no episodes can but I wonder how this will be filmed, probably in HD so will look great but hope it's still on film and does not look too stale, the great thing about the series is it had a certain look to it, light and dark, funny and sombre, it had it all 




 Yeah and it's not just Wikileaks but films like Loose Change, Zeitgeist and everything in between, but 6 episodes is limiting and it would only scratch the surface depending how the writers have done it

I wonder if the new comic book series will influence the episodes? 




 I get a cold war feel when viewing some older episodes especially the one with the submarine

When Mulder ran around outside it was so dark and foggy and very unnerving

The tension of the set pieces and the music really added depth to average scenes

Really hope the new mini series adds very post 9/11 and interconnected paranoia to the series as I know it's only six episodes but they all need to have a powerful message of current states of affairs 




 Would be great to have a section dedicated to vintage DJ sets that were spun on vinyl

Here's a stunning set from Paul van Dyk at Mayday in 2000

 Yeah his mix from Smack My Bitch Up into Adagio For Strings is very creative, the album was great yeah but it was more a laid back album instead of the driving euphoric stuff 




 Yeah they were all commercial but not always the way that MOS went with Trance Nation and the like even though original Trance Nation by Ferry Corsten was sublime 




 I wonder if this does happen, where else is there left to go, I think since her introduction in season 2, the show has gone to another level 




 Wasn't The Freak put in jail in the original Cell Block H, I know she had lots of fights with Queen Bee 




 I have scoured Discogs and am certain my list is correct, I have looked at all the vinyl and cassettes listed on there and only find his name on the ones listed above so chose various for the others but I may be wrong 




 Well, my first introduction was in the early 2000s and went to Blessed at The Republic around 2002 then Gatecrasher Resident Transmission event around 2003 so have been clubbing ever since

These albums are the best they ever made, forget the cross commercial nonsense they did after the numerous classics fodder...
