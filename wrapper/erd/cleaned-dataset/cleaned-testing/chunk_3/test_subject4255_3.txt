 That game used to scare the shit out of me. That damn witch! 




 This is what happens when only 33% of the population vote.  




 I'll give you $50. 




 Am I the only one that dislikes this show? 




 Powdered egg whites are expensive! Any alternatives? 




 Yeah, but I just want that machine. 




 Open your mouth to open your mind. 









 I don't think it's supposed to. 




 Oh jingus... I never knew. I've been going months without them.  

I'm such a fool! 




 They don't have sprouts anymore. :( 




 If you get an unwich and skip chips, yes.  




 Eh, he's okay. 




 YOU'VE. GOT. TO. TRY THIS, OH!  
YOU'VE GOTTA TRY THIS, OH!  

IT'S THE TASTIEST SANDWICH IN THE SEAAAAAAA!  

Skippidybibbitybob ohhhh yeaaaahhh 




 Hmmmm, my Aldi sells Tyson chicken. I've never had this problem with any of their meats and I buy their pork chops every week.  




 I think you watch to much TV. 

You sound like you've been educated about black culture solely through television.  




 Nothing would change. 




 As a black man, I live in a primarily white neighborhood in Ft. Worth, Texas.

We throw community parties together almost every month and have a blast!  




 As a black man, I prefer Cracker Barrel.  




 "I brought a 'big sausage' pizza and some rubbers, let's get it on." 




 Sweet! You got it! 




 How often do you look at a man's shoes? 




 Is change.org the only way? 




 Me too, mine must not like League of Legends art!  




 We should make a petition and submit it to the mods. Enough of this "Guiness Record" bullshit.

We've already broke the record now let's fix the broken system.

 Awesome, I believe you were right, single player is fantastic, multiplayer sucks (in the FPS department) 




 Thanks! I overclocked it to 4.1Ghz but mulitplayer hasn't changed much. I think the highest I can clock it is 4.2, I might try that! 




 Yep! I just upped mine to 4.1ghz and the game is running better! 




 Can you recommend any MP servers that aren't shitty? 




 Well, maybe when I get a higher paying job I'll switch over to an Intel CPU and MOBO. 

I went with AMD because they cost less (yes I know, do I want it to last?) 




 I really appreciate your help! I'm researching the best ratio now and I'll begin overclocking when I'm finished.   

I'll give you an update once complete! :D 




 Actually, I do have the ability to overclock it and it's water cooled so I believe it can happen! 

So, 4.2ghz it is? 




 Moehamhorse 




 This one:  

[AMD FX 6100 6-Core Processor, 3.3 6 Socket AM3+ ](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005UBNKWO/ref=pe_175190_21431760_M3T1_ST1_dp_1) 




 A friend of mine gifted me Arma 3 for Christmas (I couldn't be more thankful) but I'm having some FPS troubles.  

I've followed many tutorials to increase my FPS in multiplayer but I'm still getting around 24fps.  

I've had to turn the graphics down extremely low which makes the game very ugly! It's a beautiful game! I want to experience is in its glory.  

Anyhow, I've come to the conclusion that it's my GPU (Radeon 6870) and I'm looking to purchase a new one (can be a refurbished or used one). One that can handle Arma 3 at (hopefully) max settings. I also don't want to spend a fortune. I'd like to spend at max $240.  

What types of GPUs do you all use to run it at high settings? Any ideas or paths would be greatly appreciated.   


Also: I get rekt in every firefight I encounter, I can't turn fast enough...  




 I love that place! MT is awesome.

Unfortunately I moved to Dallas. I miss my curry. 




 Thanks smilebot. :) 




 Perhaps there is a difference but perhaps not. Everywhere else I've been has a much lighter panang curry, it doesn't look slow cooked from what I can tell. It's not that deep dark red. Makes me sad :(. I just purchased some panang curry paste off of amazon and I'm going to try and make your recipe when it comes in. Man, but nothing beats Madam Mam's panang curry. I could eat it every meal. 




 I wish it was that simple. 




 Awesome! Thank you for the explanation! 




 Lock-out? Tag-out?  




 I don't get it, the first comment in the first link tells you exactly why it might have been deleted.


Keep your conspiracies out of our undeletes.

That's why they are two different subreddits.  




 Oh, I misread your comment.

You were saying that if it's not a bacterial issue then don't give antibiotics.

I thought you said that we shouldn't give out antibiotics for bacterial infections. I was confused considering I am current suffering from an upper respiratory infection. 

Sorry about that. 




 Perhaps rule 0 like the last one?

It's not that funny.

Like 90% of /r/funny is rule 0 




 What about an upper respiratory infection?  




 Guns  healthcare

Makes 0 sense.

I hate this fucking state. 




 Semantics  




 Like every damn hour. Look at the top post on /r/TIL

So much hate on Islam by ignorant people.  




 You lie OP:

 My town sucks and the chain restaurant you speak of is in a shitty spot. I'm like a mile from their delivery zone. :( 




 It was actually taken from /r/jokes

 ALL THE GOOD SHIT IS GONE. Move along people. 




 Zebra Stripe! 




 If it's dead does it still count as a tree? 




 St. Peter: hmmm, you lived a great life, you were always kind, you left a legacy, come on i... Wait a second... You once took a bite out of cold pizza... TO HELL WITH YOU SINNER. 




 Awesome! It's been so long since I've played that one and I hardly see anyone in this subreddit post anything but New Leaf. 




 Is the the Gamecube version!? 




 I get a craving for a triple steak stack and then proceed to cry when I realize they aren't in season

 Rasputin Ale anyone?  




 Man fuck Andrew Jackson.

He killed thousands upon thousands of native Americans.

He can suck a fat one.  




 Mmmmm chicken shit. 




 No fucking kidding.

Everyone and their mom eats cold pizza.  




 Really!? I though I was the only one!

 I don't know anybody that doesn't... 




 McDonald's French fries.  




 I can tell you want the karma 




 Me too, I've known about this guy for 6 years. 




 I love it! I tried making my own but it just wasn't the same. 




 Re-re-reading "Stank ass kimchi" made me laugh louder than I should have.

Professor at a university but can't get their "they're" right? 




 Make sure you have CSS textures or Gmod will look like a purple nightmare  




 Shut down everything?  




 Cartoon Network, mainly for Adult Swim. 




 Careful... They'll send their *children* after u... 




 Yes? 




 He's just a troll. He lives off the displeasure of others.  




 I would, but it looks like my SS never actually sent a gift. This is the information I get when I put the tracking number in the USPS website: https://i.imgur.com/66g2yha.png 




 What do you do for fun? 

Also, are there any opportunities for liberal arts degree holders in the technologically focused market?  




 Unfortunately, packagetrackr is still telling me that it's in the same lake.

I've given up. There's always next year.

 Ladies and gentlemen of this fine subreddit,

My office is having another holiday themed party on Friday and I'd love to bring a savory dish that is inspired by Halloween. 

Can I have a little creative help from you all?

Thank you! 














 CDC stands for the "Center for Disease Control" which has 9 vowels.   

Divide that by the number of letters in the acronym 'CDC': 3  

Number of people infected in Texas (so far): 3  

Number of continents affected by the virus: 3  

Number of dogs quarantined/euthanized because of virus: 2  

333 x 2 = 666  

Amount of people who have been killed in West Africa by the Virus? 4,439.  

4,439 / 666 = 6.66  

How many characters are in 666? 3  

How many Points in a the all seeing eye triangle? 3  

THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL IS CONFIRMED AS ILLUMINARTI.  

WAKE UP SHEEPLE.

 Or just a simple bread recipe. I plan on grilling some bratwurst this weekend and I'd really like an easy keto-friendly bun recipe. 

I have almond and coconut flower on deck.

Thank you a ton in advance!  



















 I have no idea where to begin. I thought taking this practice test provided [through the LSAC website](http://www.lsac.org/docs/default-source/jd-docs/sampleptjune.pdf) would be a good gauge on where I currently stand. 

So far I figured I suck at the logic games. 

I'd love to be able to score high by the December 8th test but I also know they have one in February too. Would it be better to wait until February?

I'm also not made of money and a lot of these tutoring sessions are half my monthly income. 

I've talked to a couple of friends I know who are in law school and they said that they had both taken courses. I think one did a private tutor (which cost him a shit load) and the other took a princeton review course (the lowest one being $1550 (3/4ths of my income)).

I've looked at the links provided on the sidebar and I hear the Blueprint is a decent service that's only under $900.
