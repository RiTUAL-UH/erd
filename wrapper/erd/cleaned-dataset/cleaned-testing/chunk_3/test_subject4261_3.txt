 The UK was at war, at most, two years longer than the US. And regardless, the UK's infrastructure in regards to factories was A) bombed to shit, and B) not as large as the US's in the first place. It had nothing to do with who was where longer. It had to do with the fact that the US had the highest manufacturing ability in the world. 




 Everyone needs to see this. 




 Thanks. 




 Really, it's up to you. DLC for Total War games generally aren't make or break. It's all about the game experience you're looking for. 




 I agree 




 Darthmod is so good. 




 Yeah, it's so much more streamlined than Empire. 




 Empire is actually my favorite of the Total War series. I downloaded a mod called Minor Factions Revenge that allows me to play as minor factions. Venice is a lot of fun. 




 Blue. Definitely blue. 




 PLOT TWIST: nobody dies. 









 Napolean Total War (it's on sale on Steam for 3.74 USD) 




 Dark matter. 




 Blue of course, but only when multiplied by the magnetic effect of Saturn's Rings. 




 My license. I dropped it three days after I got it while I was at school and was too embarrassed to tell my parents. Three months later, coincidentally on the very same day that I got my car, my principal called me down and handed me my license saying that a janitor had turned it in. 




 I'm glad to see she'll go out with someone besides her brother. 




 I would upvote that. 




 Maybe but I was thinking more 58. 




 Mortician. 




 Eyes to the Wind by The War on Drugs. 




 Tyrion Lannister dies. 




 Yeah they still make them. I'm currently munching on a Pizzeria Pretzel one. 




 You're welcome!
