 My wife took our won to go visit her parents who live out of state and went to Disney land. She overheard some parents while she was there complaining about waiting 5 hours in line for their spawn to see Elsa 




 I'm not confused, I just presented a counterpoint for your reasons  




 I can see the benefit of the one time use card but that doesn't make the app more sleek. I don't see the pin as a bad part because I'm fine with not having some weird physical button that also acts as a fingerprint scanner on my phone. As far as tapping the phone, that's the point, and the nfc chip is rather small so you need to know where the chip is in your phone. I've never tapped more than one for any nfc transaction I've made with my current or last phone which was the first phone to implement nfc and Google wallet  




 Yeah, fuck CVS, and Walmart  




 What's not as slick about Google Wallet?  




 Any nfc based payment system will work as it is a universal standard. Applepay,  Google wallet, and even ISIS (or whatever Verizon is gonna change it to)  




 It has worked for me 




 Rosauers has NFC terminals. You're out of luck though at Walmart or CVS, as they've disabled NFC in favor of CurrentC which is anticompetitive and has shit for security  




 /r/technology has been on its way downhill when it became /r/piracy 




 Time to sort comments by controversial  




 I do it when I'm by myself  




 What do you mean by cheating?  




 I believe CurrentC acts as a debit.

Or more accurately, an electronic funds transfer  




 What's up with the washing machine in the kitchen?  




 I wouldn't say that's prohibitive. It is a bit expensive but I think bands spend enough money on themselves that could be worth it with the tax writeoffs 




 Color me impressed. I may have to get one for my son when he's old enough to play. I played trumpet and I wasn't very good at keeping mine nice when I was a kid. This seems like a nice compromise  




 They are, just custom made 




 Staggering Ox, Billings Montana. OP: I love that place, any of my Billings redditors wanna do a meet up there?  




 Somewhere on reddit I saw a link to their simple no frills router that costs like $20 and plenty of people saying they use that as the router and then have an external wireless access point. My modem/router is already in a central location so that's not necessarily an option I need but I did notice they have wireless routers too. I'm just wondering how they compare to ASUS given any model you look at is half the cost of its Asus counterpart. Should I get tp-link or just go with ASUS? 




 I get the feeling she supports him but also had to be in control. In one I watched someone is on the elevator and she keeps repeating herself that he likes to film the elevators because he's "like an engineer student". She's not letting him talk for himself (is he capable of talking to other people?) and does a piss poor job of explaining what exactly he's doing. In another video he is very vocal (but there were no other people in contact with him) and described a lot of things so maybe he doesn't actually feel comfortable doing this with his mother around despite her facade of supporting his hobby? The tone of the videos with his mother versus without are very different  




 Most definitely a he. The female voice you hear is his mother  




 Watch some of his recent videos.  




 Daniel Radcliffe. You're fucking hilarious and great on panel shows, why haven't you done any standup (that we know of)  yet?

 I've tried searching Google for this but the only thing I found if a certain setting was enabled with lastpass and it would cause the camera to crash. However that setting on lastpass is not enabled (basically the problem would he that lastpass would look for a place to enter login credentials in the app). This is really frustrating because I can't use my camera at all now. I've tried everything short of factory reset which I'm not really wanting to do 




 Using Windows 7 here. I can just be browsing the web or watching a show and windows pops up with "nzbget.exe has stopped working" dialog box. I then restart the program and it can go anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours before it crashes again 




 Are these decent horns? I have a Xeno from when I used to play more. I'm hoping my son will take to liking the trumpet and I'd like to have one on hand that isn't as expensive but will also produce decent sound with practice. I'd let him use my old Jupiter but I've gotten that thing deep cleaned countless times and the valves are just awful and continue to stick. 

I saw the Cleveland at a pawn shop for    $200. No damage except for scratches and scuffs, and the valves and slides are smooth as butter.

I don't know much about tools. I'm only getting started on trying to find tools now that I have space to do some woodworking 









 I recently saw either here or on /r/diy someone made a desk or table by gluing 2x6s together to create a flat surface top. I'd like to make a desk like that for myself and I'm wondering what tools I'd need to do the job and how to do the legs for the desk in a manner that I have a completely flat top surface, but still be able to take the legs off whenever I move 









 I've had this problem to varying degrees and I don't know what exactly is causing it or how to deal with it. 

In my car I have a pioneer head unit with an auxiliary jack. He cable I've had in it for years has worked great for all my devices. 

In my truck I used to have a different cable that would produce noise with any device. Eventually the cable broke so I used one of my shortest ones temporarily. The short one produced no buzzing noise but it was too short. I got some long ones from monoprice and the plugs are too big for my case and even without my case they don't fit snug and the slightest movement makes them pop out a tiny bit and then audio stops. 

I moved the short cable that produced no noise to my work Truck that has an auxiliary jack. In my work Truck, I have to have the volume pretty loud to hear the audio from my phone. There is a buzzing but it's not too annoying. When I plug my phone into a charger, it gets louder but the buzzing gets worse and is constantly changing instead of just being a steady tone. 

Would a mobile headphone amp help this issue? Or would it only make the sound louder without cleaning it up? 









 I mean that's a really cool feature that I don't have to pick up a remote to change an input or turn anything on. I used to cast to my PS3 but this is easier. Now here's my dilemma, can I get it to change back when the devices disconnect? I have the chromecast on my TV since it has CEC/Bravia Sync, but my receiver doesn't have it. The only remote I use is my receiver remote, so having to get my TV remote isn't preferable. 




 It wouldn't be so bad if every single video didn't open as some sort of playlist. When I go to a user's page and open a specific video, I'm not wanting to open a playlist of their entire history of uploads and I am CERTAINLY am not wanting to have the next video play automatically. This is driving me insane and is forcing me to use my PS3 or Chromecast for youtube because at least I don't have to worry about this problem with that platform, but the problem there is having the list of videos start back up at the top after I scrolled down for a specific video. Also, I have almost all my subscriptions sorted into categories so I can find specific users easier, which is not supported on android.


Does anyone know a way to stop this nonsense? 









 How can I deal with this for post processing where I won't have to do anything manual to combine them together so they can be renamed and moved appropriately?

I'm running nzbget and nzbdrone on windows 









 And then in passing I heard that it is a bad idea to can with a glass-top stove? Is this true? The only problem I can see is if the pot I use is bigger than the heat rings. I've never had a proper canning pot, just my regular big pot which I think fits in the big ring. 

If I get a bigger pot should I also invest in an electric burner to use instead of the stove? 









 [you can already see the ones weighted down bowing] (http://www.imgur.com/J4qvoXO.jpeg) 

What would be best to replace these with? Ideally cheap too 














 I have a 2012 Ram 1500 and when I got the truck years ago I stupidly didn't think that normal toppers wouldn't work with the Ram Boxes, I was too busy being impressed by the novelty of the ram boxes. Don't get me wrong, I like them, I keep my fishing stuff in one permanently, and roadside tools in the other. But I'm a little upset with myself over not having a topper. I want one because I'd like to go tent camping but I live in bear country so all my supplies and food need to be left in the truck. Bear-proof containers and coolers are expensive and don't offer much space since the walls need to be so thick, and a flat cover will just not do in this situation. 




 I recently bought some new cables to use in my cars for auxiliary audio. I have a really short one I've never had problems with except that it's too short. These are just simple cables from monoprice.com and I thought stuff there was decent quality but I really don't know if it's the cables or my phone because my wife's nexus 5 works perfectly fine with them. But with my phone it never stays in all the way. If you bump the phone ever so slightly, the cable comes out just enough to stop the audio 

Anyone else have headphone jack problems? 




 Can be something big or something small but it has to irritate you to no end where you still might be irked by it hours down the road 




 Just moved into a duplex and the shower water pressure is just awful. I might as well stand out in a rain shower. How would I go about finding out if this is an internal issue or if it's low water pressure being supplied to the house? We have our own water heater in the unit, thought that should be noted. 

What would I do in either situation to remedy this? I'm going to be living here for the foreseeable future and not having water pressure in my hot shower after doing dirty work is unacceptable. I already feel as if I can never really get clean and a shitty shower will only amplify this.

*edit* water pressure for cold and hot water is the same 




 I recently moved and my HTC wall adapter must have gotten packed away and the only wall adapters I have are my older ones which charge my phone too slow. I'd like to get some with similar output so I can have a few to put around the house. 














 I wear a hat for work, which happens to be pretty physical. I get dirty and touch the hat and I sweat while wearing it. I don't like not wearing a hat for work but my hat is really dirty and actually starting to smell awful. How do I clean one of these things without ruining it? 




 Our newborn hates his cradle, but most of all he hates sleeping on his back. Since he was born we have not been able to get him to sleep more than an hour or two at once on his back unless he's extremely exhausted. This is leading him to be overly tired, preventing him from getting restful sleep when he does sleep. 

We found that he zonks right out when he is put on his tummy when he's tired though. He's sleeping right now and has been for 2.5 hours. I'm concerned though because up to this point everyone and everything has been saying to not lay a newborn on their tummy when they aren't being watched because sleeping face down can increase the risk of SIDS. I want him to be able to sleep but he doesn't sleep well on his back.

It should also be noted that he is 100% capable of lifting his head and turning it while he's laying face down and he can also scoot in circles when he's frustrated/hungry enough
 




 I'm a beverage delivery driver and my hands get so fucking dirty every day and I can never really get them clean. I even got some Gojo industrial handsoap with the pumice in it but I still can't get a good portion of the crap off my hands. 

[this is what my hands look like right now] ( http://www.imgur.com/Q3adbKi.jpeg) 

what are other good hygiene tips for working a manual labor job? 




 On July 3rd our first son was born and we've been having some trouble splitting the responsibility, primarily because I work a minimum of 12 hours per day and drive a truck, which is only compounded by the fact that I get sleepy while driving no matter how rested I am. I have terrible difficulty waking up at night when he needs a diaper change or to be fed and my poor wife isn't getting any sleep and is falling asleep in the middle of the day breastfeeding him. 

He seems to hate his cradle. After you've changed his diaper, fed him, and lulled him to sleep, as soon as he hits the cradle the fussing cycle starts all over. He could be dead asleep in your arms for 2 minutes or 2 hours but once the cradle gets involved all bets are off. 

When I get home from work I basically take care of the baby for the rest of the evening so she can go take a long deserved nap but it isn't enough sleep for her. Luckily, we've been living with my parents because of various life events and they're helping us get on our feet again so grandma and grandpa have been really helpful as far as holding him so the wife doesn't have to be along for more than half the day while I'm gone. 

I'm just at a loss at what more I can do :/ 









 I'm looking for some new shoes but I don't know what kind will be best for delivering to stores/merchandising. What are good shoes that are good for all weather outdoor conditions as well as indoors? 




 He's only 5 days old right now, we've had to file his nails and we pretty much need to have little mittens on him at all times because every time he pees, poops, gets hungry, mad, or frustrated, he fails his arms like crazy and then proceed to scratch the crap out of himself. He's already gotten his face near his eye a couple of times. 




 My wife and I are currently staying with my parents until we get back up on our feet which could be a bit given my current job. We just had a newborn but I still end up with enough free time that I go crazy with boredom. My parents watch a lot of TV that I don't care much for so basically I'd like something that doesn't require a lot of tools, something I can do in front of the TV 









 I don't use auto brightness because I like to just have one consistent brightness, but every once in a while when I'm using the phone, only while it's plugged in, the brightness seems to flicker. It seems like it only happens when I'm adjusting my position or the phones position. 




 Months ago I posted in here asking for advice because my wife was experiencing extreme pains during the second trimester and was repeatedly dismissed by her OBGYN. It all came at am awkward time because we had already scheduled a new appointment for a different OBGYN because we were moving and the pains started right after cancelling an appointment with the old one. 

We finally got into the new OBGYN and they found she had some sort of infection and got her on antibiotics and fixed her right up. Leading up to the pregnancy she had a LOT of pre-labor type contractions and also retained a lot of water and he was growing at a faster rate than what was normal I suppose. 

Anyway the labor pains got real regular and intense last night and she thought her water broke so we came into the hospital. She was still only 2cm but after 6 hours of checking every 2 hours, sitting in the jacuzzi tub, walking around they finally felt a difference and decided the baby was going to come. 

Long story short, she got a spinal numb (I forget the actual term but it wasn't an epidural, the doctor couldn't get a spot for that one), they let her sleep for a half hour and then the doctor came back and it was crunch time. Literally 3 contractions and he was out and breathing fresh air and crying. Everything went well.  [Say hello to Finn Orion!] ( http://i.imgur.com/MuTt9xO.jpg) 









 It's 4 in the afternoon, it's sunny out, I'm wearing a baseball cap, I have facial hair, and I'm driving down the interstate blasting AC/DC Shoot to Thrill. Everything is as it should be. 

I work for a beverage vendor so I don't drive as much as you guys do here but I do the out of town route so I drive more than anyone else in the sales center but it's still only about 2 hours total per day. But when I do get to be on the road, I love it. 




 I keep getting the same thing from my parents that going to college is the best solution and I'll be guaranteed money. Even after telling them of people I knew who had pretty difficult degrees still working only a few dollars more than minimum wage after years, they think they're isolated incidents. Reddit has a pretty big user base with varying degrees of success in their lives so I'd like to try to make a chart of the data to present to them. 




 Working for a beverage vendor. Pay is kinda decent. I'm just wondering what other kind of jobs are out there for A CDL driver other than long haul. As much as I'd like to do long haul, I have a bad problem with driving drowsiness. I don't want to put others at risk because I can't drive more than 2-3 hours without getting tired no matter how much sleep I get.

 I can't find any recent information about the sick beard anime branch and it just looks abandoned to me. I also found there is a plugin for XDM but I can't even figure out how to get XDM to work on Windows. 




 I'm not really sure what good brands are to look for. The fans are about 1.5" x1.5" in dimension and have 2-pin connectors. 














 I think that the problem is that the software raid isn't initializing fast enough so sab resets the folder to the default which is extremely annoying because I don't have enough space on that drive to even download an HD movie. How can I resolve this?

Since there's the possibility of wires changing, I decided to use decora style wall plates with keystone/quickport inserts in addition to a decora style hidden cable insert that will put wires through PVC pipe to where a cable box/dvd player/etc will go. I'd use the much cheaper keystone Cat5/6 jacks from monoprice but lots of reviews are saying they are too wide to sit side by side on the decora inserts so I'm stuck with the more expensive Leviton brand ones 




 I'm going to be helping my dad network his house while we have some walls torn up for a room remodel. The coaxial will run into the modem in the basement and then we'll connect that to a Wireless AC router mounted to the rafters of the basement in the centralmost spot of the house. After that I'd like to run to a large switch to send cables to each room of the house.

Wires to the top floor will need to be put through a wall into the attic.  There are three regular bedrooms on the top floor and I'd like to put two Cat5/6 to each of those rooms. The Master bedroom will have two coaxial, one on each end of the room, so in addition to that, I want two to each of those spots. I'd like 4-6 in the living room as well as 4-6 in two separate spots in another room which could become a home theater someday. [Here is a basic layout of the house](http://i.imgur.com/KpMlDXz.jpg) 




 There are plenty of apps that tell you the forecast and have widgets and all that and that's nice but all I care about is getting a notification for severe and then being able to look at a detailed radar of what's about to hit 




 I think that HTC is acknowledging the issue. I called support and they are sending me an overnight shipping label and when they repair it they are overnighting it back to me. They didn't say anything about what I'd need to pay but I'll post again if they do want to charge me for the repair. 




 Has anyone had this issue? I have the Verizon model and the phone is probably a month and a half old. Never dropped the phone so I don't know how this could have happened :/ 




 I posted that I got the scooter here before but for a couple reasons I never got around to doing anything, not having the title, the money, or the time meant it took a backseat. I'm not sure where to begin with this. What are good resources to learn how to do maintenance myself?

Here's the condition of the scooter:

 I've never brewed anything before and I don't actually very much like beer but I was wondering what the process is to do root beer 









 I have 9.5 since unplugging the phone and it's still sitting at 100%. It spent most of that time in my pocket and about 30 min of listening to music in the car 









 I haven't dove into the world of NAS yet as it seems cumbersome to rebuild a RAID every time you add a hard drive and plug and play solutions like sinology are way out of my price range. 

I have a HTPC case about the size of an AV receiver so it looks nice sitting on the opposite end of the TV stand. I recently got some new hard drives for it to replace a 1tb and 500gb one so now I have three 3tb drives. 

basically I'm looking for advice on software raid and if it is reliable, like if one drive goes down, is my whole collection screwed? I'm getting real fed up with having to basically play Tetris with hard drive space with TV shows that are completed and shows that are continuing. I'd like to just have all 9tb as one volume so I can have one directory and stop worrying about running out of space on a single drive and having to keep transferring things. 




 Anyone experience this? I got the wife a Nexus 5 and while she can hear other people fine when on a call, nobody can seem to hear her on the phone. When I talk to her the audio seems glitchy and frequently cuts out. It almost sounds like she's in an area with poor service at all times even though she has adequate service. 




 Anyone have any decent experiences. Recently got the wife a new phone on straight talk and people have a hard time hearing her. I want to determine if it's just ATT giving straight talk lines low priority or if I need to replace the phone. 




 Something that you didn't like or was annoying that you didn't have any idea about and nobody even covered it in reviews.

 If I were in Billings I'd go to Montana Jack's but alas we don't have one here. What's a good place to go to? 




 At first last week we thought that she was going into labor and miscarriage so we went to the hospital right away and they examined her and there was still a good amount of fluid and she wasn't dilated and they ran some tests and everything came up fine.

Fast forward a bit and her pains have been getting worse. She has had quite a bit of back pain as well as cramping pain and it's to the point where it's nearly crippling for her. She says it feels like her stomach is tightening and won't loosen up. We've tried calling the doctors and her OBGYN and it feels like nobody is taking us seriously. These guys are always like "call us if you have any questions or concerns" and yet we called yesterday and nobody answered so she left a message...no response. She called again today because it's worse and was finally able to get ahold of someone. The doctor apparently wasn't concerned at all and "too busy" to fit her in even though the place was empty when we stopped by the hospital today. All they had her do was a urine analysis to see if it was a urinary tract infection and then they would get back to her tomorrow (and we've already had a lot of experience with doctors at this hospital not calling us about test results). She doesn't feel that it's an infection though because she's had one and it didn't feel like how it does.

I'm at a loss at what to do because it feels like the people who are supposed to be helping us don't seem to give a shit

And in the case that for some godforsaken reason this amount of pain is normal (why would the body do this!?) What can we do to help deal with that pain?

 It has been a long time so I'm sure there are bound to be lots of awesome mods and maps around 









 In addition to the thing just looking like it needs some work in general, last season I started noticing that one side will get hotter than the other, so I may have to replace the burners? I got the thing for free a few years ago and it was pretty much in the same physical condition it is now but it just needed a new starter and a regulator. I never did put in a new starter out of laziness and just opted for lighting it with a match.

But spring is here and I need a project to kick off the season. All the wood needs replacing and since I'm doing that, I'd like to have fold-up shelves ([Like this](http://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mDbbdw-d9pe5fVqEG0rmoKg.jpg)) on each side to add some space since I'm in an apartment and don't have any type of table or space out there.

I'll also end up actually putting in that starter just because it wouldn't make sense to restore the grill and not put in the starter. I'd also like to add a temperature gauge, I know there are clip-on or temporary solutions out there but I'd like to have a permanent fixture.

[Here's pictures of the damage](http://imgur.com/a/y3xS9) 














 My family is still on regular family plans but we were probably upgrade soon and I just saw a commercial for the "more everything" plan talking about how you get 2x data. When I calculated the cost for 5 lines with 10gb of data on the share everything plan, it was $300. The More Everything plan is the same price for 5 phones and 10gb. What gives? 














 For me, intentional asmr videos just make me feel weird. I like it when it just happens. A lot of the time it's in unboxing videos, I don't know why. I just came across an "unboxing" video posted on this subreddit and I figured I'd ask if anyone knows of any good unintentional ones because the intentional stuff like tapping on the box for 3 minutes straight just annoyed the hell out of me  




 I've owned my Mustang since I was in high school, and admittedly, I don't know a whole lot about cars, and I also don't place a lot of trust into mechanics I don't know, and the one guy I do know moved across the country. I only recently hit the 100,000 mark and I'd like to know what I can do to take care of my car myself. 

A few years ago I also had this weird problem where my car would just kinda lose power while on the interstate. It happened during hotter weather and it would start up again just fine after 20 minutes. No engine lights or anything. Definitely wasn't battery because I could still use the electronic stuff, the engine just wouldn't turn over unless I let it sit for a bit. I've heard a whole range of things it could be, from the fuel filter, to the fuel pump, it could be sensors, or even vapor lock. I'm just afraid to dump a whole bunch of money into doing all that and never truly knowing if it's fixed or not unless I decide to go on a 6 hour drive in hot weather, which I'm afraid to do now. 









 What are your favorite places for grub?

So far all I have on my list is desperadoes, apparently they have good hot wings. The double front is also on my list, love that fried chicken. I might also go to five guys because I don't get to eat there ever. Any great local burger places? I want a delicious half pound juicy burger to fill my stomach hole.

Also since I'm already posting, check out the new subreddit /r/montanaearthporn and post your beautiful pictures of Montana. 




 I frequently see beautiful pictures of Montana but am always unable to find them whenever I want to show somebody the beauty of our state. If you take an awesome picture or come across one, or even a video, post it to /r/MontanaEarthPorn so we will always have the beauty of Montana at our fingertips. 




 I frequently see pictures posted across the different Montana subreddits. Post them here as we'll so if you ever need to show an unbeliever how beautiful our home is, you can find the best of the best within seconds! 




 First, I just want to say that you guys are great. I specifically visit this sub far more than other subreddits other than whatever is on my front page. A lot of what I read here inspires me to better myself as a person and with food. Granted my experience so far is in a corporate kitchen and I'm not given any opportunity to really create something, I have still gained a lot of knowledge of the industry and of food itself, for which I am extremely grateful. I've been able to expand upon the ideas I see and do my own thing at home for family and friends. I'm able to whip up dishes for my friends who say they still have dreams about how good it tasted without looking up any form of a recipe, I'm just putting ingredients together that I feel work well. I love the food industry and that's why I'm saying I'm only leaving for now, because I'll be back, and hopefully next time I will be doing what I do for my friends, except on a bigger scale, and for people I don't know.

The short of it is that in July, my wife is due to have our first child. At her job, she only makes just above minimum wage, and even then, her ability to work will be hindered by having a baby, so I've been forced to look for a better-paying job that has more family-friendly hours. I got lucky and I generally only work mornings, but there are still really busy days where I'll put in 12 hours, and not ever knowing when I'll be home for dinner isn't an ideal situation right now. But for me, the best part is that since the job I've been offered pays me double what I make now, I'm guaranteed full time hours and bigger/more frequent raises. On top of that, I'm off work at 4pm every day, and I have weekends off. With the extra money I'm making, I'll be able to pay off my own student loans much faster, and I'll be able to save up money to begin my own small venture. So this definitely isn't goodbye forever, and I'm certainly not leaving this sub because you guys are my brothers.

Thanks for taking the time to read all of this if you did. I'm basically writing stream of consciousness. I don't actually have any personal friends in the industry and nobody on my side of the family or my wife's really understand why I love working in kitchens and working with food so they don't understand how someone like me can ever truly leave. Though I'm still young so I have many years ahead of me.  
























 For those of us on Reddit who also go to Xerq 




 It's a pain in the butt to shave my own head so I'd rather pay someone else to do it. I'm looking for someone who will also do facial hair the good ol' way. 




 I watched some of the behind the scenes stuff on the DVD and Satoshi was often up late being the only one in the office slaving away at his work. Has anyone thought that he put "himself" into the intro sequence?

[Link to relevant part of the intro](http://youtu.be/uXCoXW8lr0k?t=45s)

I love all of his work, and I had no idea that he wrote World Apartment Horror, which I saw a couple years ago and really liked, until a couple nights ago when I looked up to see what else he did that I haven't seen yet. The loss of his talent in the anime world 3 years ago was incredibly saddening 




 Over a year ago he decided to start clawing a wicker chest we had and to try to stop that, we got a scratching post as well as a cardboard pad. It mostly got him to stop clawing the chest but now when he does his crazy runs around the house, he stops on the stairs and claws the sides. He knows he's not supposed to do this because as soon as he sees one of us he takes off 




 Yeah yeah blah blah new years resolution blah blah. A couple weeks ago I started feeling like I'm too lazy and nothing would make me happier than to wake up at the asscrack of dawn and get some exercise in before I go to work. When I was in school I did the same thing before classes and it was great.

So what's the best gym in Bozeman? My wife is still going to school and I thought the $80 per semester fee since I'm married to her but that raises the problem of parking on campus and needing a parking pass too. Bus isn't an option because I typically work at 8-830am and the bus arrives at campus at 7 at the earliest. 




 Lately at my job hours are hard to come by. They've dropped everyone to 4 days a week in prep and since business has normalized since our restaurant first opened just under a year ago, there's less to do in prep and as a result we come in later in the morning and leave earlier. 4 days a week is fine for me as long as I get 30 hours out of it but most days I only seem to have a maximum of 6 hours of my own work to do. Some weeks we're a bit busier and I end up with 30 hours and others it's like 25-26.

I have more than a few coworkers who bitch and moan about the hours but never do everything they're supposed to, and they also don't stay and help someone whose list is a bit longer. The last couple weeks I have resorted to being the only one who stays and helps and often that person will then ask if I just want to take over the end of shift stuff and they can go, which I gladly do because I hate working less than 7 hours in a day.

On too of that, nobody does the weekly cleaning stuff which I also end up doing by myself. I don't like doing all this but it's the only way I can make sure I have enough money to pay my bills. I've already resorted to picking up a second job in case they decide to drop us to 3 days per week. Unfortunately the second job doesn't pay as well so it's definitely not an exit plan if everything goes tits up.

I love this industry and I love the work I do but I don't like needing to scavenge for hours in order to support myself and my wife, especially with a kid due in 6 months. I feel like management isn't looking at my habits too kindly and think I'm milking the clock being there longer than anyone else all the time, even though I'm the one doing the work they want us to do.

Just needed to vent some place where people might understand. None of my friends have ever worked in the industry and I've never been the type to make friends out of coworkers (not that the chance has ever presented itself)

Thanks for all the hard work I know the rest of you guys are doing. This is my favorite subreddit to visit. It's like we're one big drunken family. 




 I can't seem to find the post about it, but I made a reminder for myself on my phone but don't even remember what the site was 




 I'm going to be upgrading soon on Verizon. The folks over at /r/lgg2 [gave a convincing argument](http://www.reddit.com/r/lgg2/comments/1szxe6/why_did_you_or_why_should_i_choose_the_g2_over_an/). Now it's your turn. I could compare specs and read reviews but I like to hear from people who use them every single day. Not people who get to play around with a phone for a week or two, write a review and move onto the next big thing. 




 I'm on Verizon and will most likely upgrading soon and I'm on the fence for what I should get but the G2 interests me the most so far. 




 I work in a kitchen and we get a fair amount of to-go orders, especially large ones that require entire gallons of soup. When there is a large order the person in charge of the to-go stuff is supposed to tell the kitchen staff about it and we get everything ready. When there is a large order like that, it takes away from the soup that was meant for the dining area so we have to make sure there is enough warming up so we don't run out for the guests.

However, one person has made a habit of not telling anyone about the giant to-go orders and putting them in the computer last minute as if they didn't require any extra attention than regular orders, and on top of that, she justs takes the amount of soup she needs from the hot wells that are there for the servers to get soup for the dine-in guests. She has done this at least twice now, and every time I don't say anything about the soup, I just refill the hot-wells after she's done and I let her make more work for herself 














 I first got "into" bitcoin about 2 years ago when bitcoin was about $5-10 each. I started mining with my gpu on slush's pool and got to 1 bitcoin and had it sent to my wallet. I then raised the threshold to 10 bitcoins, but I only got to 2.88 bitcoins before I lost my interest because at the time (and even now) I don't have a lot of money and couldn't afford to replace my gpu if it died an early life from being ran at 100% for so long, especially with bitcoins being as cheap as they were.

So here's where I made my 3 essential mistakes:

1: I didn't pay attention to what I was doing

2: I left bitcoins in the mining pool account

3: I didn't continue mining

I got a new larger SSD and backed up some stuff onto an external and wiped the old one for a fresh install of windows. I didn't realize that I didn't make sure to back up my wallet until months later, but by that time I didn't really care too much. I did backup my entire windows profile though (I'm sure you see where this is going). So I spent the last year and a half thinking that bitcoin was gone as I watched the price of bitcoin climb, climb, and climb some more, getting a little more upset at each hurdle, but still thinking "well at least I still have that 2.88 bitcoins"

So then I fast forward to about a week or so ago when bitcoin flew past 700+. I think "oh I should log into slush's pool" and what do I find when I log in? an empty balance. Somehow someone took my coins! Now that was really devastating, but I only have myself to blame for not making sure I transferred those funds to my own wallet.

But tonight I had a spark of dumb genius luck. I tried doing data recovery on my old SSD with low hopes since that computer has been in use for so long, the data has likely been overwritten. Obviously I found nothing. I give up and lie down in bed, but I can't sleep still. So I get up and plug my external in and start searching, and what else do I find but a bitcoin folder in my appdata folder, and what's this? it contains a bitcoin.dat! All this time I assumed that the bitcoin.dat was contained in the program files directory, not appdata! So first thing I do is backup my current wallet.dat, and put this one in its place and rescan with bitcoin-qt. After scanning, the program opens and my first 1BTC is sitting right before my eyes, back in my possession after all this time.

It's kindof a bittersweet ending, because yeah, I still am out 2.88BTC, and the full amount could have paid for half of the debt I'm in, and I'm sure if I waited out longer, I could have paid it all off in full which would have been great because all the money going towards bills could be put back into investing in bitcoin. But not all is lost, and I'm definitely being more careful from here on out. 




 I need quite a bit of space for video recording/editing and I waited until black friday deals to do it 









 Bosses wanted someone to do some extra prep work tomorrow to make sure we have most of our main sauces and soup made so we have enough to start the day with on Friday. We're closed on Thanksgiving so no prep work will be done that day so if I don't, whoever is in charge of sauces will have a real rough day. So instead of working a few hours at my second job and in general having a relaxing day before I spend a whole day in my own kitchen, I will now be bumbling into work at 5:30am, get off at 10:30, run to my other job, work there, and then be worn out and probably not get as much of my own prep work done that I wanted to on Wednesday.

I don't know when to stop working guys 



















 More specifically, using their $45/mo plan with 4G through ATT's towers? I'm currently on a plan with my parents on Verizon and I have unlimited data. The rest of my family want to use their upgrades and that means I'll lose my unlimited due to the share everything plans. So instead of paying more for less, I'm going to get the Nexus 5 and port my number to Straight Talk. I'm just wondering how the service is in the Bozeman area 




 Both Sprint and Tmobile are not available in my area. I'm currently on Verizon with my family, but my dad wants to switch to the share everything plan (and I'm the only one with unlimited data). So by that I'll lose my unlimited data and end up paying the same amount of money for less data. Straight talk has supposedly unlimited everything for $45/month which is only $5 more than what I pay now.

What would the process even be to switch from my Galaxy Nexus on Verizon, getting a Nexus 5, and hopping on Straight Talk and keeping my same number?
