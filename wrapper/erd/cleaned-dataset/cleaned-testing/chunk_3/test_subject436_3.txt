 Can't you just download the APK and install it on an Android phone/tablet? I'm sure the package is floating around somewhere. 




 I don't think the issue is really with Iraq, but rather the spillover caused by major fuckups on all sides in Syria. ISIS would never have existed/broken away from AQ if the Syrian conflict would have been resolved quickly. 




 Here's another morsel for thought: Hong Kong has massive demonstrations every year (especially on Tiananmen), but China lets them do it. Do you really think they would even try to stop them in 30 years when the "50 year limit" is up? Massive demonstrations would ensue and the Chinese government will lose its legitimacy. 




 I don't think this really matters in the long term. Hong Kong's cultural identity is independence. You'd have to kill off generations of native Hong Kongers for them to lose it. Even migrant workers move there because of the opportunity and because it's "not China". The second they try to erase that from Hong Kong is the moment they lose legitimacy in the eyes of the people. You'll see mass demonstrations and civil unrest, which the Chinese government does not want and would not be able to control in the mass media.

Simply put, China is deathly allergic to civil unrest, and there is no way to completely impose Communist rule without creating utter chaos in the region. 




 Stimulating the immune system is going to be one of the big things in the coming years.

Here's an amazing result presented at ASCO with pembrolizumab, which helps to re-activate the immunity-based antitumor system: http://www.ascopost.com/ViewNews.aspx?nid=16291. My impression is that these types of drugs are probably broadly applicable and could become standard of care for all patients. 




 I think it really depends on what Boehner's (and the future whip's) goals are -- whether it is to maintain establishment control of the House or to win the national election. The facts are that many primary challenges from the Tea Party already come from solid Republican states that would not affect the result of the national election. However, moderate reforms like immigration overhaul can be forced through an non-election year like 2015 while maintaining the Hastert rule. These types of actions can pull many of the slightly left-leaning purple states back into play. Even though Democrats are going to get pummeled in 2014, they currently have a massive structural advantage in winning the national election (with or without Clinton). The establishment Republicans know this, and the question is whether they are willing to sacrifice a significant amount of house seats in order to survive nationally.

Personally, I don't think Boehner or any high-level politician really gives a shit about some random House member who is afraid of actually having to campaign hard for their seat. What they might anticipate is that by passing bills that are more moderate, they can also win House seats in purple districts to buffer any new Tea Party members that may get elected. It would come out even in the end, and the Republican Party would have a net gain in their White House chances. 




 My bet is that Boehner is going to be more aggressive about pushing his (more moderate) agenda after the 2014 midterms. The impression I got was that he was worried about Cantor taking his job, but with him gone there is nobody else in the House that could possibly challenge him for Speaker. 




 Why would Democrats do that? It's not like picking up seats in the House will mean anything this cycle. 




 I'm sure that the "establishment Republicans" are shitting their pants right now after winning several primaries a few weeks ago. Boehner must be pretty happy, though. 




 It's a completely different medium though. Storytelling in Hollywood has to be done in between 2-3 hours, whereas shows like GoT and True Detective have 10 hours in a single season. 




 The issue is that for decades (even in the 90s and 2000s!), a college degree statistically led to much higher future incomes -- much more so than a 2-year or vocation. The problem is that the recession in the late 2000s caused an unemployment shock, and created scars in companies where they are less likely to take someone who is "green". The student loan thing was never a problem given a decent job, but wage stagnation coupled with reticient hiring has made the problem really bad. 




 You should qualify that statement with: good schools without significant financial aid.

There are many elite schools that pile on the aid in terms of housing and tuition. Princeton undergrad is free. Harvard is free if your family makes less than 80k, and then it's a VERY modest percentage of family income. On the flip side, there are plenty of elite liberal arts colleges and public universities that don't have competitive financial aid packages, and that's where you will see increasing numbers of rich folk (because everyone else can't afford it). 




 The Canadian government has said it will announce new plans for a more focused and effective pilot program for immigrant investors in the coming months.

Let's hold our judgment until we see this. 




 Did the judges taste it? 




 There are a lot of oral insulin therapies currently in clinical trials. Many of them have tags (peptide or chemical) that are attached to recombinant insulin. I'd say that is more of a solvable problem than making a pill. 




 The only problem is that seeding guts with genetically modified bacteria has never been done and is probably going to have a hard time at the FDA. Theoretically you could functionally cure type I diabetes by engineering E. coli to express recombinant insulin with specific molecular triggers (eg. some kind of sugar alcohol or drug inducer) and have it live in the gut. Many types of insulin on the market today are recombinant, so it's not a matter of capability -- it's a matter of the FDA flipping its shit when you produce a "living medicine". 




 People are way too religious on filmmakers and screenwriters. There are only a select few who consistently make great movies. Having a change of staff before a single thing has been filmed will not ruin the movie. 




 Likewise, I'm reserving my judgment until the movie actually comes out. Marvel has a great track record, and it could be that the original Ant-Man script actually sucked. Everyone's willing to jump down Marvel's throat but it's not that directors or screenwriters have a 100% record either. 




 I think people wouldn't mind if reasonable and effective security measures were implemented by highly trained professionals. The problem is that most institutions in this country work on the "lowest common denominator" principle, which means they will do the worst type of work they can get away with (in this case, billions of dollars). 




 It's stupid because these school administrators are all about eliminating any kind of liability, and yet in the process of doing so they cause a child to get a sunburn which they are liable for because they banned sunscreen. Imagine if the child were even more light-skinned and got a blistering burn. 




 Too bad she's been completely absent in the season post Purple Wedding... 




 I wouldn't even recommend seeing that movie on DVD. Honestly, there was no plot and maybe 20 minutes of monster battles. 




 Can't you carry some liquid energy with you to sip on at mile 20? Or is that considered cheating? 




 Will this have feature parity with Android devices? I hope they have a Gmail, Maps, and Hangouts replacement. 




 Her acting's been really off the entire season (and maybe the past one too). It just seems like she's phoning it in, compared to the other actors on the show. 




 Intermittent fasting is actually what they called it in the article! Apparently it's really good for establishing portion self-control. 




 Jack will never die. If ratings/ad revenue are good then they will always hold the option of making another season. 




 Does anyone else think that she looks like a female version of Odo? 




 The question is, do YOU feel like you're settling if the guy isn't perfect looking? If you do, then you're setting some impossible standards for yourself and your future partners. I'm far from perfect looking, but do I ever think that my long-term girlfriend/fiance is settling for me? Of course not, and I too never feel like I'm settling for her. You would develop serious trust and insecurity issues if you carry this mentality with you. Relationships are not pie charts, checklists, points systems, zero-sum games, or pro/con tallies of traits -- your partner is one person that you have to consider as a whole in their entirety. 




 It was surprisingly not a terrible movie! It was a solidly mediocre action flick. Highly recommended. 




 I'm a scientist, and starting to dabble a bit in Python. My background is in MATLAB, which is not exactly fast. I was surprised at how *slow* Python was, given that tons of scientists recommend it! 




 There was an article recently in the NYT that showed a new method of "dieting" where you basically "fast" every second day. One day you eat normally, and the second day you basically just skip breakfast and have a small lunch. People who were put on that regimen were able to keep on it longer, and they actually ate less on their normal days! Those people said that they got used a larger "range" of what hunger felt like, so small pangs no longer lead to binge eating. 




 When Starbucks came out with their blonde roast that was the joke of the day for the whole year! 




 Here is the magical coffee maker that will beat anything you get out of a college coffee shop: http://www.amazon.com/Melitta-Ready-Single-Coffee-Brewer/dp/B0014CVEH6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1401696468 sr=8-1 keywords=melitta+coffee+cone

Buy a large airtight mason jar and store your coffee in a cool dark place. Get some nice beans and pregrind them to a "Melitta" grain size, which is very fine. You might think I'm crazy for suggesting pre-grind, but the fact is that (a) you will be going through the beans quickly, and (b) any decent grinder you buy will be very expensive and won't match an industrial grinder's evenness or quality. I have never noticed any difference in quality from preground beans that were stored for a few weeks.

Get a water kettle and a measuring spoon. Tailor the amount of grounds you add in to your taste. I usually do 3 tbsp for a cup of coffee. You'll need the #2 filters from Trader Joe's.

Edit: also, don't get a porcelain coffee cone unless you like wasting your time heating it up. 




 Disagree on the French press. It makes the flavors and textures all muddled. If you want clean distinctive flavors, you should go with the pourover method. It's basically drip coffee, yes, but the advantage is that you have complete control over the flow rate and temperature. The reason why autodrips make awful coffee is that the water never gets hot enough. 




 I think the problem is that bagels get stale way faster than other bread products. Loaves of bread can last a long time, but two days is probably the maximum for bagels.

Edit: that said, you'd probably have an easier time if you turned them into bagel chips! 




 It's a comic book (movie). They can retcon or futcon anything. They do it in the comic books all the goddamn time. 




 Do you think it's genetic or from upbringing? I know lots of toddlers/kids who are picky eaters, but there are some who will eat (and enjoy!) anything. 




 Many crops that you eat today are the product of UV/gamma ray mutagenesis. This never occurred in nature either.

Similarly, a lot of popular fruits were made by grafting plants on each other. That never occurs in nature.

The fact of the matter is that practically 100% of the food that we eat has been changed so much by humans that you wouldn't even be able to recognize their ancestral forms -- even if you go back several hundred years. 




 You forget corn. Its ancestral forms were so WTF that I'm surprised Native Americans kept it around for that long.

In terms of modern (eg. 20th century) science, people "created" new strains by mutagenesis. They would literally bombard crops with UV/gamma radiation, plant them in fields exposed to the environment, and see what came out. For those who are worried about health and environmental concerns, this is far more risky. But of course, the USDA approved these foods rather than the FDA. For some reason, whole-scale genetic changes are OK but changing/inserting several genes is not.

We have the power of hindsight to show that broad-scale/coarse mutagenesis methods are safe. Nobody ever seriously thought that this would be dangerous to the public. While the safety concern in GMO food is strain-specific, we should treat it with appropriate and proportional scrutiny, not hysteria. 




 Usually you don't have to pay a dime for these kinds of lawsuits. You're suing for damages + lawyer fees. 




 Pro-tip: apparently Brita filters can turn shitty vodka into pretty decent ones. 




 It can definitely fit. You just have to squeeze the sandwich harder. Most of the vertical space is the vegetables and the bun. The patty itself isn't any thicker than a regular steak after it's been cooked. 




 Really? That seems like a lot of water for a quick steam... 




 I love the way he explains everything: "You gotta put butter on the bun because it's shit without it." No BS. It just tastes good. 




 For sure! I was in a pretty tough program in undergrad, and we always had group homework sessions. It's a waste of time to do homework by yourself when you can ask your peers/TAs for help. Most professors are very supportive of this because it encourages collaborative learning, but keep in mind that working together could easily lead to copying assignments -- and most students succumb to the latter even with the best intentions. It will bite them in the ass eventually but they do it anyway. 




 Also, do your homework. It's amazing how your exam grades improve when you don't have to learn everything the night before.  




 This is why I hate "showy" cakes like this one, because I'll have to pick off all the fondant before I can even get a decent bite of cake! 




 Where at? I might have to move to NYC now. 




 I know right? "Why are you talking to me? Can't you see I'm eating a sandwich?" 




 IMO, it wasn't even worth the $8.50 student discount price that I paid. Godzilla was on the screen for maybe 15 minutes, and the other monsters just flew around and didn't do shit. Not to mention the huge plot-holes. I could forgive all that if there were lots of monster-Godzilla fights, but most of the time it just cut away to another scene! Especially during the Hawaii scene when they first start fighting! WTF was that? It just cut to the next day and the MUTO had ran off with no explanation!

Pacific Rim I could forgive, because it was exactly what I expected. Godzilla had no plot and no action. 




 That's amazing. As a cyclist in the Bay Area, I'm so happy that cyclists were one of their test cases. There are just too many drivers here that don't pay attention! 




 THANK YOU. Godzilla was awful. I saw it last week and couldn't believe the gushing comments on the official Reddit discussion thread. 




 Jack Reacher was pretty much the best mediocre "serious" action movie. Usually the ones without comedy take themselves too seriously, but this movie hit all the right notes. 




 Yeah, there are plenty of American cities with an extremely high proportion of attractive people. Just go to the cities with a lower average age, eg. places with young professionals and students. Places like SF, LA, San Diego, Seattle, Portland, Boston, NYC, Chicago, Phoenix, Miami... this is also where over 50% of the country live too! 









 What? I've only heard it being called P N A S. The only ones who pronounce it wrong were the non-academics... 




 Does anyone know if these birds can see the infrared beam that comes out of the motion sensor? If they could then it's a little less impressive. 




 I think I'm probably the only guy on Reddit who buys CoD solely for the campaign. At 30 years old, I don't have the time nor skills to go gun-to-gun with teenagers on the internet. I happen to think that the campaigns have been getting steadily better too! The only exception would be Ghosts -- that campaign was excellent, but was just way too short. 




 Yes, very sharp edges can cause damage without you feeling it. Once I cut my thumb pretty deep with a razor blade but didn't notice anything until my hand was covered with blood. 




 Dad joke or not, that one was pretty good. 




 Actually, IF could be easily done if you eat dinner at 6pm and go to bed at midnight. That's automatically 14 hours. If you skip breakfast, you've already done ~18. 




 There's an article on NYT that says that long-term intermittent fasting (eg. eating way less every other day) is more sustainable versus dieting. Apparently it also mentally trains you to fight against hunger signals too, so you start to eat less on your normal days. 




 If you are a scientist, Wolfram Alpha saves you a lot of time by doing unit conversions automatically! 




 Easily One Hour Photo or Insomnia. 




 Holy fuck, that sounds amazing!!! 




 Lack? I don't think a doener kebab done in the German style exists in North America! I've searched far and wide and found nothing. 




 In addition to the neat drugs coming out (especially imatinib for CML comes to mind), cancer can be curative if it is caught very early and is in an organ amenable to surgery. If you can take it out before it metastasizes, in many cases the cancer is eliminated. Things like early stage colorectal cancer comes to mind (get your screenings done!). 




 The stupid thing was that the new Google Maps was not "feature complete" until much later. Off the top of my head I can't think of anything new in Google Maps that blows the old one out of the water. Take Google Hangouts too, for example. In most cases it is 99% the same as Google Talk. It took them over a year to even get any kind of reasonable unified messaging going on. The first few versions were so goddamn slow for no reason. Now they finally have a version that works better but drains battery life. It's as if they can't help but break the wheel. 




 What features? The old Google Maps had 99% of the ones that you needed. Some are completely useless, like the timeshifting frame when you're looking at public transit schedules. That thing is a goddamn UX nightmare, but on the old version it was perfect. 




 A friend of mine dated this guy for a while who only wanted to date/sleep with virgins, and (no joke) found anyone who didn't fit that "standard" to be disgusting. It wasn't a religious thing either -- he was just some white dude going to a pretty good law school to give you an idea to his age. I guess there are no limits to assholery. 




 Probably overkill, but when I work with RNA I always open up a new box of tips. 




 January Jones was also in that Liam Neeson movie I think. Totally ruined it. 




 If they added in a tiny laser diode and buttons for slide advancement, this thing would sell like hotcakes to the business crowd. 




 How would that work? Aren't the old covers made for a smaller screen? 




 I think part of their strategy now is to iterate quickly and accordingly make small batches of the units so they won't run into a Surface 1 debacle. Sell them at a loss/break even but refresh them quickly to keep up with the tech news cycle and build up to what consumers want. Honestly, by doing this they get a lot of goodwill from the tech crowd. It shows that they are actually listening to complaints and addressing them in later releases. 




 Actually, I don't think an i7 1080p+ laptop with 8GB RAM and 512GB SSD would even be priced at $1949. This is very competitive pricing from Microsoft, although I wish they would throw in the type cover as a bundle if you buy them together. 




 Here's a related question: why are you buying the SP3 as a basic office/netflix machine when an Atom powered Windows tablet does exactly the same thing? 




 I just found out they are moving out of their Stanford location... WTF 




 Postdoc and former TA here. We don't give a shit if you are late with your homework or assignments, but we will be offended if you are dishonest about it. 




 Wow, nice! There are a lot of things that Excel can do that are a huge pain in the ass for python. This is speaking as a guy who lives and breathes MATLAB. Excel is excellent for a lot of edge cases, and having that crosstalk is another nice tool in the box.'

Edit: $99 :( 




 The other last thing under his governorship was to have an open primary system! 




 Holy shit, that's video was practically pre-youtube... I didn't know that was WKUK! 









 If FODMAPs are really the culprit, then it really begs the question of whether the specific cause is of microbial imbalance. After all, histology on Celiac-negative patients show no obvious signs of a physiological response, so the only thing that would cause gastrointestinal upset would be the microflora. 




 Once you're finished with that, check out The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, and then The Philadelphia Chromosome. 




 Umm.... plastic is organic too. Dead dinosaurs and oil. 









 At this time last year or even two years ago, getting 1000 comments on a thread was a *huge* deal. Now we see regular AskReddit threads going into the 5-10k range. 




 I think this is something that PIs should advertise too, especially if they have a very comfortable pad of money that they are sitting on. Many graduate students and postdocs generally will have never heard of any given professor, but they are more likely to work for someone if funding is stable and they have the spending freedom to do something ambitious! 




 I mean, besides having superheroes, how are any of the Iron Man movies similar to Thor? or to Captain America? These are the three "solo" franchises that Marvel is actively producing, and they are very different films. 




 Marvel also had the great idea of tying all their disparate superhero franchises together, and added teaser trailers to the end of each movie. What ends up happening is that you get a great sense of cohesion, even though these movies are nothing alike. 




 Have you seen the trailer for Constantine? It looks like a pile of shit. Probably cancelled before the end of the season. 




 Have you seen the trailer for the Constantine TV show? What the fuck is that. 




 Or, you know, they could have graduated already. 




 My favorite example was how imatinib (Gleevec) was invented. The hurdle wasn't due to a lack of knowledge -- we knew the structure of the site to target -- but rather the most difficult part was to convince Novartis to take the risk with a Phase I clinical trial. What we really lack is the capability to test the effectiveness of drugs in vivo on a massive scale. There are tons of molecules where we see a significant "biological" effect, but we have no way to screen for their bioavailability or in vivo effects without going into an animal model. 




 With regards to nutrition, I think you are perpetuating a myth that we "don't have a handle" on it. It is quite the contrary -- we know the vast majority of risky lifestyles that substantially reduce lifespan and increase death rate. The medical literature is quite conclusive and is muddied by fad diets and lifestyles, The rest regarding antioxidants and vitamins, are indeed "dotting the is and crossing the ts" so to speak. The factors with the largest effect size and statistical significance have been solved for decades. 




 I think the outcome depends on the restaurant. Certainly this law wouldn't make a difference for downscale places where tips aren't gratuitous. However this would effectively reduce the number of people who would want to work at a high-end restaurant, because the obscene tips effectively bumps them up to a higher pay grade. What is eventually going to happen is that the high-end restaurant itself is going to have to start offering higher wages in order to attract staff, which means higher upfront prices on the menu.

Personally, I think it all comes out even, but the major difference in the previous case is that the tips all go to the service staff anyway (and maybe people behind the scenes too) -- that kind of income is often protected against the business owner. In this new case, the restaurant pockets the increase in prices and doles out what would be the lowest effective wage that the high-end restaurant labor market would bear. In this scenario, there's a chance that business owners can end up making a nice chunk of money and screwing the staff because there's no such thing as a food service sector union to negotiate fair wages. 




 Your friend is missing a crucial point though -- you can't make blanket statements about medicines, since their mechanisms of action are so disparate. You have salicylic acid and artemesinin, two plant-derived drugs that are first-line use, but you also have a ton of other plant-derived molecules that can't be used in people without significant modification. These kinds of generalized statements about drugs and medicines are unfortunately convenient because they don't require much critical thought, but the fact is that you have to look at everything on a case by case basis. 

Add onto that the **type of knowledge** that we have is very different today then it was back then. There's still a lot to be discovered and a lot of uncertainty, but it is not in the same areas as 50-400 years ago. We are capable of more critical thinking today than in the entire history of civilization, so it's not useful at all to generalize. 




 Doubt it. The reason why drugs in the first half of the 20th century was that people knew very little about organic chemistry and how drugs interacted with the body. We're in the age of molecular medicine, so many drugs that are discovered today will probably stick around for a long time. What we are lacking today is very different from back then. Today, drug development is more of a lack of capability than a lack of knowledge.  




 Seriously. At 7' tall you could load the tallest chromatography column in the world without breaking a sweat. 




 Yale might not have been a bad choice if the kid wasn't really into ball. All of the elite colleges give significant financial aid or are free anyway. With Stanford you'd be practicing all the time, but Yale would give him more free time. 




 Seriously. Stanford would be the perfect balance for him. 




 No shit. He just has to keep up his grades and apply to Stanford. Great basketball team and stellar education. 




 How the fuck can Applebees be better than Red Robin? That's not even possible. 




 Al Madrigal is easily the funniest of the correspondents, but Larry Wilmore is pretty good.  




 Have you tried ATCC?
