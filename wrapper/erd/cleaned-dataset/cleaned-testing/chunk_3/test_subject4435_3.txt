 You doin' ok OP? Any news for us? 




 How can we help? 




 You could just add it to this one to avoid the post ban. I had to do that a couple times when I posted about my son. 




 Maybe you're just an asshole? 




 I... I think you're dead. I don't know how you're posting on nosleep but the crying, the being ignored like you're not there, etc. Were you in any kind of accident or did anything strange happen? Any missing time?  




 Yeah... I know we're supposed to believe this stuff but... 




 Creepy but won't scar you for life. Promise. 




 It is SO not your fault. Accidents happen. You didn't do anything wrong. Also, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with your transition. It's this awful cycle where being in the wrong body makes you depressed and being depressed makes you unsuitable for T and surgery, which makes you more depressed, etc. I hope you hang in there OP. Feel free to PM me if you wanna talk. I have a little experience. Not in the dead guy department but in the trans department. 




 What did it say?! Why isn't she feeling well? 




 Don't jump OP. You're safe now. 




 I had this theory but I haven't been able to figure it out myself. Op's username spelled on the keyboard of a phone could spell KNOCK with an extra letter. Op sent me : 42764440. I don't know if I'm patient enough to figure out what all the numbers could mean but maybe if it's a group effort?
Edit - for this cipher to work, the 1's don't mean anything.  




 Is it possible you watched something that happened in the past play out again? What is the history of the building? 




 Kaskistentie, Finland? 




 I'm seriously gonna need to watch Preppers. Everyone keeps talking about it.  




 Your username. 




 Stop panicking. You're going to be okay you just have to stay calm and be logical. Make a list of things you need: food, water, etc. Then make a list of ways to get those things. You're alone there so what about taking what you need and keeping track of it so you can repay it? That would ease your conscience. Better yet if the store computer systems are working, scan your items, go through the process on screen, and print yourself a receipt. As for fuel for your car, there are tanks underground in the parking lot of most gas stations. They're covered by manhole covers which you can lift and drop a bucket into the tank to get fuel. It's easier than siphoning. 

Edit: PM me if you need someone to talk to/more advice. I'm always here.

Edit 2: Go to a camping or sports store or even some hardware type of place and get a wind up flashlight with electrical outlets on it. You can wind the handle to charge your phone in case of loss of electricity. This is a must and needs to be done asap so you can keep in contact. 




 If you can get to a gas station, you can lift the covers and drop a bucket into the underground tanks. They all have access covers so they can do dips to check the level in the holding tank. Usually on a far side of the parking lot without a lot of parking spaces around it. It's easier than siphoning but be careful of sparks or any source of ignition. 




 Keep in touch with the meatball guy and hang tough. It's gonna be okay. Find something to eat, try not to drink too much alcohol. Post a link to this story in the comments of the other one so we can keep of track of both.  




 Writing was good but I'm left very confused. 




 I thought I was the only one who still said stay frosty. 




 Upvote for relevant username/comment. Hand with claws, [TALON]company91 suggests other side of story. I read too much. Sorry. Still upvoting though because I talk too much. 




 I've eaten four gaviscon foam tab thingies in the last hour because of my incredible heartburn. Why the hell did I read this? 




 Please keep us updated with anything new OP! I don't think you're in any danger right now though. 




 Burn it. Burn it asap. Then salt the ashes. 




 Any news on your situation? If you're experiencing something similar you should post it/keep us updated so we can try to help. 




 Any news on your situation? 




 We only have to believe OP's stuff. Not random commenters with obviously fake stuff! 




 I wish. I can't wait much longer. 




 Chill out. They just meant that a lot of us just skim the "New" page and read the titles that stand out to us. That's all. No one is ignoring you and it's not that we don't care about your wife's welfare. We do. We just don't all see posts all the time. There's an online database of medical professionals who are lifestyle-friendly. Check out fetlife.com groups. Someone can ALWAYS help. Maybe you both should talk to someone. Good luck. I hope everything turns out okay. 




 What about telling us in some sort of coded message? Nosleepers are awesome at codes. Or even giving us the name of a piece of your art we could google to find your name and then go from there? Something not direct, something that may not work, ya know? I think anything is worth a shot at this point. Good luck OP. Stay safe. 




 So no mold then? :( 




 Oh. My. God. I haven't seen gibberish like that since the mold! And the title... ROT 13. No way.  




 Thank you! I knew there was something there! 




 In this vein I've also heard that sterling silver can help ward things off. Sterling jewelry is usually quite inexpensive and readily available. I can't speak to it's efficacy though, it's just something I've heard. 




 I actually agree with you 100%. My son is 7 and even for being really smart and witty, the kid just can not lie to me. He has said things a few times that I've had a hard time believing but he's almost always right about whatever it was. 

OP, I believe your daughter. Don't push about the mug. Ask her if her friends took the pictures, how she met them, when she sees them, etc. Maybe also don't leave the younger daughter alone with her for a little while, just in case. Not because she'll hurt her but because the friends might. 




 In fear of having weird stuff start happening to me, I'm too interested to not help.
The numbers. Has anyone looked at their cell phone lately? 5 (JKL) 6 (MNO) 1 is blank so a space I assume, and 2 (ABC).
Can anyone make a word or three words I guess out of those letters? Even if it's just a sound or something?

Edit: More thoughts.
The number is an OCLC number in the worldcat.org library system. It's for a mircofilm. I'm gonna include a link just in case Cymon and Iphigenia is somehow relevant. http://www.worldcat.org/title/cymon-and-iphigenia-painted-by-sir-frederick-leighton-the-story-of-the-picture-illustrated/oclc/561621561 




 I literally have no idea how to help you. But you really need to see a doctor about your sore. Please update us again soon. 




 Anything new in the last few hours? 




 Agreed! 




 Leopard print bandaid FTW! I thought I was paranoid too. 




 Yeah. I assumed they were drinking. The last guy talked about beer a fair bit in his comments. 




 Keep posting them here just make one account and get all your dates to post from the same one, in the same post. That way it looks like a "saga" and the mods don't delete it for not being a story. 

I like rules. They keep me from being dead. Unlike Eldon. And Warren. 




 I suggest if you have a message you'd like passed on to family or friends, you post it as a comment here and then shut down the account before she can.  




 Yeah. You're done for. Let us know if you make it out alive, but I have my doubts. 




 Oh my god. Men are idiots. 
We're not paranoid, we're trying to save you. 
You can get laid any time if you get out of there but you won't be fucking much if you're dead! 




 It's only been 46 minutes.... 




 Why wait? Why not just listen to us and get out of there? You're probably not even Eldon anymore. The winky face in the last post meant it was Mal posting. 




 I think I sped it up by trying to warn him.
