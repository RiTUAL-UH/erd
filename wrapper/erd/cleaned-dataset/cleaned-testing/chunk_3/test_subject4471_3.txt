 I have a GTX 670 that will run any emulator and most AAA games at 60FPS maxed. Looking to get 165 (w/shipping) for it. 




 GPU is in great working condition, with a little wear on the back panel.

Acer monitor just bought Aug 2013, so still works perfect. Keybord has evidence of wear and tear (see timestamp), but otherwise fine. Samsung monitor is a bit smaller at 1680x1050, but works fine as well. All monitors include cables.

Looking to get ~~$160~~150 incl. shipping or best offer for GPU. Taking offers for other components.

Verified PayPal only, I will invoice you and provide tracking number once shipped. Also willing to trade for Dragon Age Inquisition + $$$

~~[Timestamp](http://i.imgur.com/VKatAal.jpg)~~ 8800 Ultra, ignore timestamp. Can't tell my own GPUs apart -.-

 I reposted it, sorry. Reddit won't let me change titles. 




 FFXIV feels incredibly empty and solo-friendly. I joined Balmung for roleplay, but the RP community practically ignores you if you're not some "notice me senpai" Miqo'te in one of their little cliques. 




 No its very easy to catch up in WoW. I quit because the new xpac is more of the same, but my guildies are enjoying it a lot. 




 The 980 is a luxury item compared to the 970, so they have free reign to charge whatever they want and know people will still buy it as it's the #1 in the world.

Personally I went for a 970 and used the money I would have spent on a 980 to get a QNIX 1440p monitor. Far Cry 4 maxed at 53-60 FPS! 




 Christianity's "cliff note" is on our sidebar. "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

lol 




 I got a Cardboard and E:D with it was awful. Google Cardboard is a novelty at most, something fun for a couple minutes with VR-supported android games. 




 I'm ugly and I'm proud! 




 I'm sure they're great, but as a game dev and writer myself, it is hard to get into the same plot again when you know everything that will happen. Same issue with Far Cry 4, but Pagan Min is intriguing enough to continue. 




 Congratulations. I pray you have a long and happy marriage :) 




 This is WoW for me. I am unsubbed from WoW now due to new expansion burnout but it will probably drag me away from FFXIV in a few months 




 How do you have so much time? 




 Is it still the same BioWare story? A villain emerges. You get tasked with assembling a team to combat said villain. You then spend some time doing side missions and building sidekick loyalty, meanwhile you do 2-3 main missions to further the main plot. You do a mission and discover villain hideout, master plan or both. You do a big epic finale. End. 




 I'm ugly and I'm proud. 




 A hi-fi indie space dogfighter with 10~ maps and some different modes and about 5 ships is maybe worth $20 at most. 




 lol 




 Heated seats and windows? This community really needs to get its priorities straight - the fish tank AI needs a serious re-tuning. 




 Want more threads about miqo'te butts? 




 Who cares? 




 While all of you are complaining, I was able to make a character after having just bought the game on sale this afternoon!

No longer need to get up at 6AM tomorrow for Balmung :D 




 Practically every fantasy F2P MMO on the market can fill your needs.... 




 Lineage ~~Two~~ One is most popular after WoW. 




 Mortal Online is a dying, empty POS. 




 Does the gil offer only work on Hyperion?  




 Take a break unless it is a game that you really want to play. I got a bunch of new games recently from Black Friday, but the only one I desire to play is Skyrim. Even the new WoW xpac bores me. 




 I am Christian myself so overly "gamer l33t" stuff like this with Jesus tacked on makes me cringe a bit, but a friend tipped me off about [Game Church](http://gamechurch.com/) a while back.

They basically are an on-line ministry that goes to big gaming events like E3, where they get involved in the community through a Christian gamers podcast, forum, hand out free Bibles, etc. 




 If World of Warcraft interests you, there is a guild called Old Farts which is mostly comprised of 30+ years, the average being in their early 40s. My own WoW guild is mostly late 20s to late 30s, with a few in their late 40s even.

There are plenty of guilds your age, but they require a bit more effort to find. 




 No. Give us the coordinates.

 You'll get your money's worth for the questing and dungeons. At end-game, once you have done all the dungeons and maybe dabbled in some raiding, not much else going for it

 good lord.... 




 Murder is murder.  




 Questing was great. Garrisons were fun during leveling too but at 100...the expansion shows its true colors. It's okay, but still more of the same (I don't know what I expected). 1 daily quest, no real 100 content outside of some repeatable heroics. Here's hoping the raids are awesome. 




 Similar story. When I was working in Laos PDR all I had was an Asus gaming laptop and Assassins Creed Brotherhood and the Office seasons 1-6. I had no other games on me for 3 months.

I 100% AC:B multiple times, must have put in 200 hours into that game. I rewatched all the Office episodes I had too.

If anyone ever goes away for a while, buy a Kobo and load it with books. You will go insane off a couple games and a show. 




 OP, you wasted 30 seconds of my life and I want them back. 




 He would have used punctuation and formatting 




 Don't take anything from brictop. Known scammer who reposts his Black Widow keyboard. Will contact you through PM only as he's banned 




 I have a GTX 670 I'm looking to sell as I bought a 970. I don't need RAM that much but I can sell you the card for 165. 




 Similar question as OP; I mainly play WoW, space sims (Star Citizen) and the odd FPS like Far Cry 3. I got a 970 from newegg, do you think that can run 1440p, 144 or 4k? Which should i look at getting and is 4k worth it with only one card? My mobo is incapable of doing SLI. 




 The pirates are so powerful they blew up the moon 




 http://i.imgur.com/QPLpNdk.jpg 




 http://i.imgur.com/QPLpNdk.jpg 




 Sounds reasonable. I'll bump down my OP then to $165 OBO 




 That's why I included or best offer. How much would you pay for it? 









 He is banned from posting, that's why he will PM you instead 




 I have a GTX 670, $150 shipped. 




 If brictop comes to you in a PM, ignore him. He is a scammer and known to resell his Black Widow mechanical keyboard 




 Does 2 year insurance on a starter really matter that much? You'll be out of your Aurora and into a 300 or Cutlass within a few weeks I'd imagine.

Keep your package, it has alpha and will save you money long run. 




 Like I said - its an optional subscription if you want to see more behind the scenes stuff every month. The game just requires a pledge package for now 




 No 




 It's a development subscription - you get access to the magazine, a forum I think, some concept art. It's basically an additional way of supporting CIG and you get some cool Making-Of stuff on the side each month 




 Teach me your secrets. 




 Confirmed this is me. I couldn't post from this account as I was getting Reddit's anti-spam pop-up "Your last posts didn't do well." 




 Well I did just [list my account for sale](http://www.reddit.com/r/Starcitizen_trades/comments/2n1rmf/black_market_890_jump_specter_lti_m50_amd_mustang/), since I'd have no idea what to do with all the credits I'd rather just make a new account and buy an Aurora. 




 Can confirm, I am the same person. Wanted to get the post out there but couldn't do it from this account due to Reddit's self-posting rules to reduce spambots. 




 The annual subscription is $240 as well. I am considering doing what OP did...but I have 740 in credit if I did that. 




 Well now I feel guilty for owning an 890 Jump

Edit: sold everything for $700, still have amd mustang and $40 credit to spare for future modules. 




 Aurora LN is the best for that. LX is simply the "deluxe" version, which means it comes with a jump drive (that you can buy for the LN) and a leather seat (and who cares about that because it's a game). 




 I'd take a GTX 980 over a picture of a spaceship any day 




 Yeah, 6000 freight units (compared to 1600 in my 890) is nothing to scoff at... 




 Nothing yet. I have the Super Hornet upgrade, UEE Coat and Pistol sitting in my cart ($65 total). I am considering melting my Specter Package and buying a Merchantman, or melting my 890 Jump and getting 2-3 different ships. Or melt both packages for $740 total to get a ton of stuff 




 I'd melt the Cutlass for the Freelancer personally. The freelancer appeals to me more, but they're both good ships. 




 Get more insurance? 




 All of my ships are untradeable as I melt - buy - melt etc. 




 Someone pointed out to me the MM may be the most difficult to get as its an alien ship. The others, Starfarer and Caterpillar (I am not interested in the Ret/Glad) would be quite easy to obtain if you had the in-game credits for them.

So I am deciding if I should scrap buying the Hornet Upgrade for my Specter pack, and just go with a MM. 




 I have a Specter Hornet Ghost package from last year w/ LTI. Maybe I should melt that and pick up a MM 




 I don't think it will, based on my ~~3 second~~ in-depth analysis of the one concept picture they've released.

Why would it need to? It's just a trade ship. All it needs is a big cargo container and some guns. 




 You'd barely be able to pilot it too. I could *maybe* understand if you were the leader of say...TEST and had lots of money and hands available to help pilot. But you and I are single pilots - the most expensive ship I have is a Jump and even now I'm considering melting down to something smaller. 




 I wouldn't be either. People love to throw away their disposable income. 




 Looks really cheap. I'd pay a dollar at most 




 $2500 for a spaceship? No fucking way 




 Banu for commerce, hands down every day of the week. The retaliator is a bomber and little more.

Caterpillar is more of an in-between, as its designed for boarding and trade. 




 I have been eyeing the Banu MM and Starfarer for quite a while. I love the dirty, more cyberpunk feel to the ships than the 890 Jump. But the Jump is limited edition.

Do you guys think I should hang onto it? Right now my cart has the Super Hornet Upgrade, UEE Coat and the Aurora LX. 




 Absolutely. Best MMO on the market in the "theme park" genre. Everything about the game screams polish. WoW is the only MMO I can install, jump into and simply play without having to dick around with controls, graphics, annoying UI or weird mechanics. It's fairly simple, it's fun and it works.

On the 21st they're having their 10th anniversary special day, where they're releasing a special 40-man raid with a free mount, pet and helmet. 




 I'll be Gus, the lovable engine sweep; clean as a whistle, sharp as a thistle, best in all Westminster, yeah! 




 It was just vapor lock! 




 because of some phony god's blessing?

 The best way to start would be in prayer and in the Bible. Pick a Gospel (I recommend John) and get reacquainted with scripture. Ask lots of questions and try to understand what the author is writing (or what Jesus is saying). Perhaps get a biblical commentary to help you understand the underlying themes and meaning.

Additionally, 

 I no longer go to church

Start going to church. Ignore that crap on the Internet about "existential Christianity" or "home churches." Find a real church. It doesn't matter what kind to start, as long as they practice sound doctrine. Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Baptist, it really doesn't matter since they teach essentially the same thing: God loved the world so much he sent his only Son, so that whoever believes in Him will not die but have everlasting life.

Ask your friends for some church recommendations or maybe go with them one Sunday. I know you're introverted (so am I), but make an honest effort, ask God in prayer, to get out of your shell and get connected with other Christians. Join a life/study group, volunteer at charity events and give yourself to the poor.

 Is it possible for me to do this in the comfort of my room

No. A Christian is called to go out into the world and *interact* with other people. Christ didn't sit in Nazareth and send people out to do his bidding - he went into the towns and ate with sinners and healed the sick.

 I'm thinking of contacting my old friend but I know she is very busy..

If she is the Christ-loving girl you make her out to be, she probably won't care and would love to sit down and talk with you. Make the effort, give her a phone call. Don't email her, don't text her. Call. Her. Phone.

Good luck buddy. 




 Use the search function since this has been discussed many, many times.

Essentially as a Christian you're to follow the law of the land (whatever state/country you reside in). If cannabis is illegal, you can't smoke it. If it is, go nuts, but do it in moderation as to not become addicted. 




 I am guessing you don't have a toddler or spent any time around young children to see how incredibly selfish we are before we learn about etiquette and being good. Kids are assholes to each other.

It's the Christian belief we are sinful and broken *by nature,*  This sinfulness is a condition we brought upon ourselves and cannot be rectified by ourselves. You don't even need a history book or a TV to see evidence of this - sin permeates all societies of mankind, big or small. 




 Because meaning would be defined arbitrarily, simply on the whim of the individual. Who has the final say without some universal standard? These are the questions I asked myself for 10+ years on my path back to Christianity from Atheism.

I am not claiming to know anything; they're just fun questions to challenge ourselves with once in a blue moon. 




 But again...there is no point to their lives either, so why bother reduce suffering? In the words of Rust, we've become too self aware. Why not all just walk into that one last sunset? 




 That line of reasoning makes no sense 




 We need more Jews (and Orthodox) here. You guys tell it like it is. 




 If it bleeds it leads. 




 You millenials can't take a joke. 




 DAE euphoria? 




 They also believe Jesus is literally the Son of God, not just Protestants.

Source: am anglican/catholic 




  we could just as easily start a cult where we make all the adherents do their best to actually act and live as they believe 'Jesus' would have acted and lived, had he been in their shoes. 

So, Christianity? 




 Simpson sleeps nude in an oxygen tent, which he believes gives him sexual powers. 




 I hate every chimp I see from chimpan-a to chimpanzee. 




 Takes insult for no reason. Uses unecessary quotes. Tries to catch sympathy over nothing.

Definitely a millenial. 




 Well raids scale now so they soloed the 10-man version 




 But I bring you love :( 




 Following all of the Quran, God's Word, to the letter. It has some nasty stuff in there. 




 Muhammad had a 9 year old wife. How can you call a religion one of peace and love when its founder was a paedophile?

Those extremists are fundementalists, I.e. they follow Islam to the tee. Most Muslims are moderate and ignore the evil in their own hadith and Quran. I'd say this is God acting in their hearts to be more Christ-like. 




 No and likely never will considering he deleted his twitter and reddit account.

I am just thankful we have our sub back with competent, fair moderators. 




 No, it's not, but that shouldn't excuse the frankly bullshit "apology" he gave us, then he has the audacity to start a charity drive for an anti-bullying NGO? Are you fucking kidding me mate?

He's trying to cover up his own personal failings with the moral high ground and I'm glad most people in this thread are seeing through the bullshit. 




 He has no proof of said calls. He doxxed himself with a dating profile he posted. He is a known liar and general dickhead, frequent bully who uses the word fag like everyone else on the Internet. He's now being bullied and trying to cover his tracks. He has yet to apologize for his childish behavior.

No sympathy. 




 /r/wow had its own Siege of Orgrimmar.

You all get Nitesmoke Wolf Mounts and title: Name, Liberator of LGBT Rights as a reward. No heirlooms.
