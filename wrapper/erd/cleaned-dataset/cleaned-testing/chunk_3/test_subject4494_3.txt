 Fun fact: more boys are born than girls, but as they get older the trend reverses. 




  Did they not completely fabricate the murder for hire charge which was enough to get him the negative media attention before the charges were dropped?

No. One out of 6 hits was set up by the agents, although it wasn't fabricated; Ulbricht did order them. The other 5 are not known to be by the corrupt agents. 




 Most of the bitcoins were lost well before then. See http://blog.wizsec.jp/2015/04/the-missing-mtgox-bitcoins.html

  Turns out the agents involved in bringing silk road down were actually involved in more criminal activity than DPR himself

How do you calculate *more* criminal activity? 









  If I can still affect it after you've already collapsed the measurement, that would seem problematic, especially if "you" and "I" refer to things the size of people.

But "I" and "You" can't communicate with each other. As far as I'm concerned, you haven't collapsed yet and are in a superposition.

You raise a good point that this may set a lower bound on how large superpositions can grow before they collapse; of course in non-Copenhagen interpretations this is irrelevant. I don't think this experiment proved it in anything near the size of a person, though.

I think defining "observer" is still an outstanding problem, but I'm just a layman. Do you know of any decent not-too-technical descriptions available about the progress of figuring out "what causes the collapse" so to speak?

I'm also a laymen, but try https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/9857/what-is-an-observer-in-quantum-mechanics and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_(quantum_physics). 









  Then goodbye causality

Why?

And who is this "you" of which you speak?

This can be any observer, does not require consciousness.

That is the hard problem of the Copenhagen interpretation.

You'll note I worded my comment to not require Copenhagen ... 




  You started talking about free market motivation of black markets and his philosophy and now you are just parsing words just to make a point .

I disagreed with what you said above, and said so.

If you have anything else to add please do so in the form of a logical discussion.

I think you are incorrect in your claim above that he "knew it was wrong", and I'd like you to either retract that statement or defend it. 









  It's a distinction without a difference in this case. So he knew he was doing something illegal, ergo he got caught and is going to jail.

No argument here.

I really don't understand what you are arguing at this point.

Your claim that he "knew he was doing something wrong", which I think is not supported.

I get it, he's is your hero

I haven't said that.

  There's also the fact that the guy was caught lying about other things, like his grant funding and receiving different teaching award, on his vita.

from OP

 I also take full responsibility and apologize for misrepresenting survey incentives and funding in LaCour and Green (2014).  In fact, I received a grant offer from the Williams Institute, but never accepted the funds,the LA GLBT received funding from the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr.  Fund., and the Ford Foundation grant did not exist. 




 But how do you prevent abuse? Can I convince the server that road X has 1000 cars on it if I want to keep people away, for example? 




 I read that Google's car speeds if the cars around it do becaus it's safer. 




 If you didn't see the measurement, it hasn't collapsed/decohered relative to you. So you can still affect it. 




 How do you go from "he knew and participated in illegal activity" to "he knew he was doing something wrong"?

Many people don't identify morality with law, maybe Ross is one of them. 




 Ross opened a market with very few restrictions on what could be sold. He's said many times that he did this for philosophical reasons.

You claimed that he must have thought it was wrong, but haven't explained why.

Many people have defended him and think he did nothing wrong; why is it impossible that he also thought so? 




 His lawyer claimed in sentencing that it may have been role-play, because apparently people don't always mean things they say online.

Also, one of the six hits was faked by the corrupt agents. 




 Yeah but why would J be friends with him in the first place before making sure he wasn't a purple? 




 of is minor and left uncapped 




 How do you know what will happen when it goes under -2.0 and no clicks are received if that hasn't happened yet? 




 But for filthy pressers like you. 




 Will never press.

Anyway the button is rigged. 




 *bot too far 




 So why hasn't that been appealed back to the Supreme Court again? 




 It's called reddit, and there's a sub at /r/nocontext for listing all successes. 




 Well they claim he didn't write any code, all we need is for him to release a single line. 




 Apparently they aren't told that the other family is also judging them, according to the article. 




 That "exploit" was for poorly made apps that didn't verify receipts. Locking down content already on a user's device is not such a great idea anyway.

MITMs with user consent are not a security problem, except insofar as users are stupid. 




 Huge impact upwards, yes. If Apple loses money in the market by dumping for less than the buy price, that money goes to the other people in the market and supports a higher price. 




 You said he must have thought it was wrong, but why couldn't he have thought free markets are right? 




 That's an issue with the law, not the trial. 




 You can't destroy a market without holding coins, at least not directly. Buying then selling has little effect. Shorting could have a greater effect, but only insofar as Apple has the ability to short, and there are probably limits.

Declaring debate over is a very bad sign. 




 That was the same complaint parent had rephrased. Many hodlers wouldn't sell except at exorbitant prices, I don't know how many coins are like that, but I'd expect a significant amount of coins to go unsold if Apple stepped in. 




 Maybe that's because they didn't have much of a case. There were also a bunch of tactical mistakes made by the defense.

Do you think all trials with guilty verdicts are shams? 




 They couldn't get all (some have been burned, Satoshi's, etc), but likely can get an 80% majority if they were willing to use all their money on it. 




 You seem to think somebody can't actually believe in free markets enough to break the law, why is that? I'm not following your logic here. 




 What parts of the trial were shammy? 




 When was a plea offered? 




 It wasn't always clear, tobacco companies lied for years about it. There's a reason they paid billions to lawsuits. 




 Yeah but hype 




 That's irrelevant to my view, which is strictly consequentialist and therefore doesn't care about blame. 




 I think some jail time is warranted, but not anywhere close to what he got. If it was up to me, probably 2-3 years. In an ideal world, we wouldn't have jails, and these questions would be irrelevant. 




 Someone gets it. 




 I don't. Asserting that I do doesn't make it true. 




 Get a couple in your basement and rotate

 Yet it isn't one of the drugs that are illegal. (Well, except to some underprivileged members of society). 




 I'm pedantic, what can I do? 




 How are you deriving my moral beliefs from factual statements I've said, in violation of the is-ought problem? 




 Why is smoking cigarettes legal and not marijuana?

You could look up the debates that occurred when the laws were written if you want to find out. 




  Never once has a tobacco company executive gone to jail.

 But smoking isn't illegal, drugs are. 




  yet nothing's being done about it

Source? 




 Yeah but one article might have info others don't. 




 I looked at the context, and referenced it above.

He's clearly talking about a one-time increase, if you look at the code at the beginning of the thread. There's absolutely nothing that implies multiple increases, as you claimed above, and have not shown. 














  The point is that "auto increases over time" is equivalent to what Satoshi meant by "phase it in."
 Both of which refer to making the change non-abrupt -- with ample warning, ample lead time, etc.

No. Auto increases mean that no hard forks would be necessary in the future, the block size would increase whenever it's needed. What Satoshi wrote was just a single one-time increase. 




 The part you claimed above to be from Satoshi was the "auto increases over time", which wasn't in that post.

 No. First of all, the 20MB blocks would only be valid on top of all the blocks from now to the fork date.

You'd need 50% to do this. 




 Phased in, in context, means that clients that upgrade aren't immediately incompatible with older clients until a specific point is reached.

In other words, don't switch to bigger blocks until a delay. 




 Huh? Satoshi's proposal was just increasing to a new hard limit. 




 Tell me it's not your constimotherfuckatutional right to keep your mouth shut without having to worry about that silence being used as legal evidence of your guilt.

I didn't actually make any claims about rights, but here you go:

Tell me cops/FBI aren't sometimes untrustworthy, crooked, and famously fraternal, that media doesn't get it wrong like when they posted a front page picture of a high school athlete and his track coach under a screaming headline labeling them the Boston bombers.

Nothing I've said implies that the media don't get things wrong; I feel strongly the opposite of that view.

Give me a reason why lawyers, judges, cops themselves, constitutional rights organizations, and your mom last night say the smartest, safest action to take when you're in trouble with cops is never talk to cops.

There are several reasons, but this is irrelevant; the silence here was in an interview to the media, not to the police.

I don't hate cops (for reference, I full on hate you), but I won't put my trust in them to act in my interest.

If you're going around hating random people on the internet for disagreeing with you, you might have some problems.

You can't be this dumb, this naive.

The statements you're implicitly attributing to me are not my opinion. You've used several strawmen in this discussion, which tells me you don't have a clear understanding of the situation here, or are deliberately misleading to make points. 




 P.S. you can upvote somebody without exclaiming it to the world like an idiot.

Upvoted. 




 That's why you don't argue over definitions.

 Proof by contradiction: assume that not everyone who agrees with this is wrong. That means that someone must agree with this and not be wrong, because logic. But since someone both agrees with this and is right, this must be right, which contradicts our premise that this is wrong.
However, since everyone who agree is wrong, but the statement is correct, therefore nobody can agree to this true statement.
