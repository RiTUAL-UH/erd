 Yes, I have become self aware. 




 Perhaps yeah. I'm going to estimate 1993 - 1994. 




 I feel this has become a very hilarious game of "Guess Who?", good fun old chap. 




 I need an adult. 




 Low attention span I believe.  




 Wat. 




 Go fish. 




 I know the type you're talking about, I think everyone in the industry will meet a few quantity over quality people during their aviation travels. Which of course is very unfortunate. Hope it all works out for you.  




 I'd love to order a print of this. I feel like this is the second time I wrote this comment to this picture in this sub. Dj vu. Anyone know the original photographer? 




 Very cool. 




 Thank you, and I hope you get to fly one as well. Good luck. 




 That's very interesting. Did you work on the original Twin Otters by any chance? 




 When and why did you make the switch? 




 Will do, thanks for the support! 




 A wise mechanic once put skydiving in perspective for me, "Why would you jump out of a perfectly good airplane? Even if this thing is on fire, let's ride it out a little and see where it goes." 




 Yes it is, the Calgary division. 




 I've never been on one, but I hear they're awesome. 




 Ha! No I am not, I assure you I am in the picture but wish to remain anonymous. I've never posted my face to reddit before, so I imagine this will be the closest I will get.  









 I used to have a large array of handles, but my main one was "Iceman". Thought I'd see if there are anymore of you out there. 




 Done and done, thank you! 




 Goddamnit I love Tina. She has to be one of the best characters on animated television. I feel star struck on the Internet now, thanks.  I just want to say thank you so much for the entertainment and please keep doing what you're doing, Bob's Burgers is awesome. How can I get an autograph from Tina? 
 




 NOoooooooooooOOOoooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!! 









 Unfortunately I cannot shed light on the quality, as I've only just begun collecting my favourite albums on vinyl and have not yet invested in a setup. This of course is something I want to do right and make sure I am financially prepared so it'll be a ways away. All I can tell you is Diamond Eyes is on white vinyl and that it was indeed the 85 dollar bundle (95 Canadian for myself).

EDIT: I believe they are all 180 gram.

 This will definitely garner downvotes but ever since I've watched the True Detective series, looking back on Dexter is like trying to remember the plot of an Archie comic. 




 Cool shots, thanks for sharing. Didn't see any of Pino. Did he not tour this leg? I really love his style, was hoping he would be a permenant any member. 




 I too, choose to believe this happened. Amazing. 









 Interesting.  




 Thanks man, I've been waiting for this bundle to pop up again. Just placed my order. 









 Nice try officer.

EDIT: Minus Police. 




 I received "Closing Time" as a Christmas present one year. As a result whenever I listen to it I'm reminded of early evenings with wine and cigarettes in the snow.

EDIT: Redundancy. 




 I've always wanted to find the time to make a compilation of every time Scully's eye twitches. This is also good, thanks! 




 [Jacob's Ladder.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099871/)

EDIT: I should add this is one of my all time favourite movies, not just as a horror either. It's from 1990, but holds up really well IMO.
 









 Yeah I hear you. I'm looking forward to it. 




 Grand is an excellent description. 




 Stinkfist. 

My favourite single. 

Spookiest. Grittiest. Most surreal. 




 I think [HR Giger](http://www.hrgiger.com) would also be a phenomenal choice. 




 I'd love to see it happen, although yes I know it's highly unlikely.

That's what I meant by that statement, I probably should have been more descriptive. 




 Definitely not against this idea. 




 I'm a fan of Alex Grey's work, don't get me wrong, but I just really love Aenima's style the most. I'd love to see it happen, although yes I know it's highly unlikely. Thoughts? 




 Me too, it's quickly moving up the ladder of my favourite APC tracks.  




 I start my work day every morning at 6AM with this song and a cup of joe. Actually makes it bearable. 




 I just wanted to say that I think the live version of "when the levee breaks" on Stone   Echo is goddamn fucking amazing.

That is all. 




 On the link you posted. 




 Ah, no I haven't. Thanks for the heads up. 




 CTRL+F a few key words I wrote with no results. Will it be updated? 




 It's Wednesday. 




 I would frame this if I knew where to get it. 




 Hey thanks for that. I'm prepared for the massive crowd and long line ups, at least I think I am. Either way, getting my evil dead poster signed is more important to me than actually meeting him. I guess I'll just have to wait and see. 




 Yeah it can be very tiring carrying a 30 pound kid everywhere. Especially for my poor pregnant wife at 7 months when I'm not around, essentially carrying two kids every time she has to leave the house.  




 I am strictly speaking from a Canadian stand point, I usually have the opposite problem as yourself, this is of course assuming you're American. 




 Thanks. 




 Hey thanks for the info. I'll look into it. 




 Nope, I'm talking Calgary. But I'm sure it's the kind of tour or setup.  




 Not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this or not, but the one and only Bruce Campbell will be at this years comic con and I'm a huge evil dead fan. This was enough to spark my interest and get me really excited about attending this year. Now I should add that I've never attended one of these before so please forgive my noobishness. 

I'd really like to know what Bruce is like for those of you whom have met him, I am not really the nervous type but have a feeling he'll set me back a step. More importantly what's the etiquette for getting stuff signed? Can you bring more than one item if any at all? Or do they make you purchase while inside?

I think that about sums it up, it's going to be really cool to meet a guy like Bruce, even if it is only for a minute. Thanks in advance dreddit. Again sorry if wrong sub. 
 




 Dude, I've had a girl tell me this exact same thing, then even go as far as naming the baby girl after my Mother. I didn't think I could afford a paternity test at the time, and thought it wasn't worth it because you know, she named her after my mom and all. My brother who was much more established than I was at the time insisted on paying for the test, lo and behold the baby wasn't mine. I was surprised at first even though it was only a one night stand deal that turned into a few more times afterwards, but apparently this chick was going through a really bad break up and this was her way of coping, obviously not filling me in on the details.

Either way, I didn't mean to bore you with the details seeing how you are probably in a much different situation, but goddammit, that paternity test changed my life. Please do yourself the favor before doing anything else.

That was 11 years ago and I am currently happily married with an 18 month old boy, and a girl on the way. I'm really not sure if any of that would have come to fruition had I taken her word for it. Speaking of which, I should call my brother, what an awesome guy.

EDIT: Grammar. 

EDIT: Spelling. 




 My son is about to turn 18 months next week and he still doesn't walk. He did however start the spider walk yesterday (feet flat on the floor, legs straight, and moving forward with his hands) so I'm hoping that's a good sign. I was having this same question/thought plague my mind the other day, and I keep asking myself if I am doing anything wrong. 

On that note, it sounds like your son is doing fine, the whole army crawling thing is just another variation of crawling I believe, I watched a niece of mine develop the same way and she turned out to be a very smart and sweet little girl (age 7 now). I remember thinking it was peculiar, but it was just another developmental step before she was up and running. Otherwise everything else sounds right on par. Enjoy it while you can, babies are so sweet, I will miss these days I just know it. 




 Interesting. Tis a shitty situation she put you guys in, hopefully she'll cool off enough so you can track her down. 




 I do not personally know or have I communicated with your sister, however I would probably start with her account history, to see if any of the information she's posted in the last while makes any sense to you or the rest of your family. Good luck. 




 Pretty sure this is as high res as it gets.

 Yeah, USPS is a pile of horse shit. 




 Would it be possible for you to transfer those to imgur? The Facebooks are blocked at my work place, and I am a very impatient person. If not no worries, thanks. 



















 Nice thanks OP! 




 This is what I do when I laugh on the internet ---- "hahahaha". I'm never sure if it comes off as sincere or not. 




 Surely op will deliver. 




 I too am having this problem. What the hell? 














 Totally what I meant to say. 




 Quoting ~~hooker with a penis~~ aenima in a tattoo thread on /r/toolband.

EDIT: Brain fart. 




 PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!! 




 May I too have the recipe when you wake up, these look amazing. Thank you. 









 I know, tool putting their twist on that song would fucking intense. 




 [Echoes](http://youtu.be/uJtw7SP0oN4) 




 Congratulations man, that's huge news!
 




 Thank you very much, I hope my little angel will be as observant as yours! 




 I've also heard of this method, but am very reluctant to use it. Although it may be effective, I don't want my child to associate me with physical pain. 




 I try asking him what's wrong, but he doesn't really have a grasp of the English language yet, only uses a few words. But I make sure to talk to him as much as I can, pointing and naming everything in sight. I'm hoping for that language explosion any day now. 

As for stomping feet he still doesn't walk, however when he gets frustrated with his toys for whatever reason he will let out a squeal and throw a small tantrum until one of us can help him out. 




 We more or less do this now, I guess persistence is the name of the game. Thanks! 




 I have no idea honestly, it seems to be some sort of play fighting. I know his intent is fairly harmless, but it needs to stop either way. He is a really active child, we have a hard time keeping up with him, he has no interest in television and loves to drive his cars around on the floor and dance to music, I doubt it's an surplus of energy. I'm hoping it's some sort of phase that will dissipate as he develops his sense of empathy. 




 This sounds like a much better process than my current voice raising. It breaks my heart because he pouts when I tell him what he's doing wrong. I know he doesn't know any better and that he may even have a hard time understanding me, and that this is method I use probably isn't going to be effective in the long term. 

Thanks so much for your thoughtful reply, I will definitely try it out. 




 Hello /r/parenting, I'm so glad I found you this past week. I can tell I have much to learn from you guys and I look forward to growing with you. Having said that, I am new to fatherhood with my 17 month old son, and his soon to be born baby sister. So far I am having a blast, with all the ups and downs, all I know is I wouldn't change it for the world and that this has been the best experience of my life so far.

The reason I come to you guys with this post is that currently my son has started to hit really hard, he has always had a thing for pulling my wife's hair, but now he's doing both to us. I really don't know how to react when he does this, should I be firm and tell him no? Or should we try not to draw any attention to it. So far I've been doing my best to make him understand that it hurts and that he shouldn't do it, but it's seemingly having no effect.

I'd really like to know how to deal with this especially before our little girl enters the situation and becomes another victim. Thank you so much for any help you can offer.  




 There's always a way, I have seen Jurassic Park 34+ times. 




 Yeah, I'd say when the day comes I require its services, it'll be all fixed up. 




 J'ai mang une motoneige avec des poissons? 




 Wow, what is this world coming to? 




 Probably not an intended media server, but a little go get'em attitude can fix that. PS3 wasn't an intended media server either, but it's probably my favourite one I've ever owned up to this point. 




 Fucking halo made me get the Xbone, even though it isn't even out yet. Regardless, when my PS3 dies as my current media server, and the price is right, I'll replace it with the PS4.

The fact that they are both lack backwards compatibility really irks me all the same, Street Fighter Alpha 3 for the PS is one of my all time favorite games, so if my PS3 ever does bite the dust I don't know what I'll do.

EDIT: I called every future shop/wal mart/best buy/visions ect ect. in the city when I tried to purchase the Xbone and there was zero availability if that means anything. 




 TIL the PS4 is way better than the Xbone. 




 I had the same problem with the xbone, so I ordered it from future shop's website with free shipping. Showed up at my door in 1.5 days VIA Canada post. Not sure if it would be similar for the PS4, but it's worth a shot. 




 Ahh yeah, you're right, it totally is a mirror. Very similar to the [inspection mirror](http://imgur.com/tiaPDfj.jpg) I use at work. 




 Excess string spooled up? 




 I had the same thing with the DVD, waited about a week and a bit, then got the shipment confirmation email the other day. So they will replenish their stock. 









 I love this thing striss, great work!

EDIT: Can we secure an area while we're working on it? Probably put a timer on there so if one forgets it'll automatically reset and be available to the public once again. I was drawing a flag, came back in an hour and someone had it messed up, now I'm pouting and don't want to continue. 




 Although his/her answer was thorough and awesome, s/he did allude to Calgary being more of a white collar town, which is really not the case. Maybe on the surface it would appear that way, but there are many trades for one to get into. Even with only a high school diploma, you could definitely get your foot in the door as a pipe fitter and make a great living in a few years. Do you know people in either town or surrounding areas? That would be the biggest deciding factor for me. 




 Good old Sook Yin, I used to have a huge crush on her growing up. I seriously miss the 90's MuchMusic format, back when the programming actually covered music, and music related subjects. Yes, we live in a different era and they have to pander to what sells, I'm just disappointed. Please don't link me to the MTV guy ranting to people like me.

I thought she did a decent job with the interview, maybe a tad nervous, but that probably comes from being a big fan. I thought Maynard handled the tool related questions just fine, he more or less finger pointed towards the other guys at the end there, but that's nothing new.

EDIT: [She's still looking cute as ever](http://m.imdb.com/name/nm0498271/)

 I had a small click of friends that slowly expanded throughout high school, some of my expansion pack friends were more popular and went to parties with people who I generally didn't associate with (jocks and preps I believe were the terms we used back then). I recall going to one of these parties (somewhere around 1998), where the booze kicked in and I had the balls to stop the music that was currently playing, whatever it was I remember it being terrible. Either way I remember dropping on aenima that I had brought (I never left the house without 15-20 cd's and a discman in my backpack). I was expecting contorted faces of disgust and hatred, however stinkfist kicked in and everyone seemed to mesh to it, and it was awesome. Then I thought to myself, ok, this will all change when Die Eier Von Satan comes on. Waited patiently for that industrial German racket to begin with my troll face in gear. Again, a room full of people from all clicks just had the best time, it was the first time I think I realized that maybe it was me who was the asshole and not everyone else. It's like I shed a layer of hatred that night.

I have no idea why I just replied to your message with this.

EDIT: Grammar/additional info. 




 I have to agree with you. This video was on the front page yesterday after all. I'd say it's probably OP. 




 Hey thanks a lot, I'll look into it. My only concern is waiting right now, I like the idea of not having to order from amazon. But it's good to have options. Thanks again for the info. 




 Can you make any recommendations? 




 I'm looking to upgrade my desktop computer sound system, was wondering if any of you fine people have any experience with the [Harman Kardon Soundsticks III](http://www.memoryexpress.com/Products/MX44014)? 




 Thank you kind internet person. 




 Thank you very much! 









 I've never seen it. I guess I should check it out?

EDIT: "You" = "I". 




 Thanks. I also love the song "Rosie" by Tom Waits, and then of course there's Interpol and their song "Evil". I thought to myself, this name is mentioned way too many times in songs I love. 




 Thank you. 




 I am a little bit of a collector, however I don't mind sampling most things from the internet, but when it comes to music I feel the urge to physically own it. Maybe I'll take your advice until I can find a copy! 




 I hadn't taken part in this poll, but am very surprised to see "Rosemary" so high up in the rankings. I also love this song, and have talked to my wife and we have agreed to use "Rosemary" as the name for my daughter to be. Glad people love it as much as I do. 




 Will do thanks. I ended up ordering it off amazon but they were out of stock so I have to wait for them to get more. In the meantime I'll try music stores around the city. 




 It was definitely worth it. Also, the live DVD is amazing. 









 Is there anywhere else to purchase this item other than [puscifer.com](http://www.puscifer.com)? The $30 shipping charge is astronomical, and I haven't found another place to buy it yet. Any info would be awesome, thanks. 




 I just had one at [Oasis](http://www.experienceoasis.ca/index.php) yesterday, they do fine work. No membership required. 




 Awesome. 




 Haha I am not surprised.
