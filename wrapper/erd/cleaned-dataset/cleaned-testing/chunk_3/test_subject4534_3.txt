 We don't air our dirty laundry in public. We try to keep family problems to ourselves. But in a small town, it's hard, word gets around. We also don't take the bait and engage with antagonizers. 




 I have a mid 2010 macbook pro that still works great. When I felt it was slowing down I wiped the entire thing to brand new. I also know someone with a 7 year old macbook pro and it works just fine, no problems, it just needed a new battery. 




 As someone who has helped to take care of younger cousins since I was 11, and babies from when I was 17 and up, a healthy 4 month old is fairly easy to take care of. But then again, I want to go into childcare and love kids! 




 I was a vegetarian for only a year. It was easier to be a vegetarian in the city (vegetarian friendly restaurants, fresh cheap veggies, fruits, etc) but once I returned home to my native american hometown, it was hard. I tried until I relented and became a pescatarian. Then I relented some more and accepted traditionally harvested meat into my diet. So, vegetarian no more. Once I went back to the city I didn't know if I could start over again. I do want to become a vegetarian again. Possibly when my roommate and I finish our store of meat in our freezer. 




 I'm incredibly careless with my stuff. I have a habit of tossing them around when I'm done with them. Also, I'm clumsy. 




 I have a relative like this. He also has very little filter so will say inappropriate things. He's deeply embarassed me a few times with his loud voice and ramblings that included me somehow into a topic. So... I now avoid him when I can. 




 I've always wanted to learn more about horses and take horse riding lessons. It's a dream of mine. Now I'm scared I'll turn into this. 




 Sounds like my kind of party! 




 123wpm. I already knew I was a slow reader but wow, I am slow. I like to build the image in my head though so I re-read paragraphs and make mental notes of character names and other bits of info because I have terrible memory. 




 I had no idea the Superbowl was tomorrow. Aaaaaaaand I still don't care. 




 I'm this friend. My hope is I'll arrive on time this time for sure. Nope. Now I know to add 30mins to my ETA. I've been late my whole life and it's hard to change that habit. I felt bad for my one friend. He told me he arrives at the time of the meet up even though he knows I'll be late because he can't stand to be late. 




 Hermione was my favourite character and I hated that she ended up with Ron. Harry made a better match. 




 Reading was just what the girls in my family did. I wasn't an avid reader like my sister but I did read a lot. My parents would take us to the bookstore once a month. I didn't appreciate books until a few years ago. I read Divergent and the book made me angry. JK Rowling was able to build a world, characters, and sympathy in ~200 pages, something Divergent failed so miserably at in the same amount of pages. Thats when I started to appreciate good books and truly start to enjoy them. 




 My nephews and nieces would eat all the fruit. Then discover the candy. There is no hiding it from them. Except the top of the fridge. They're still too short to reach even with a chair. Except my uncle and cousins can reach the top of the fridge. Solution is to eat the candy as soon as you buy it.  




 Declare one day a year to be Pajama Day. Everyone encouraged to wear pyjamas the whole day. I'm serious about this one. 




 My favourite thing to do is listen to music, watch tv and go on the internet when I have the house or apartment to myself. It's the best. I can do all these things without being disturbed. I also like going to the bookstore and spending hours in there looking at books. 




 My hometown is completely surrounded by wild untouched land that goes on for what seems like forever. If you're going camping it's a lot of portaging, a lot of carrying packs, and a lot of paddling for hours on end. If you bring an iPhone, iPad, or iPod you better protect it! My mom dropped her iPhone in the lake one time. My dad was smarter and put it in a waterproof case. But neither of us brought any kind of chargers. After a long day of paddling/portaging in the hot sun, it's nice to relax in your tent and listen to some music, play a game, or watch a video. Then it dies and you still have a few days to reach your destination. I plan on taking my oldest nephew on our next camping trip and I'm sure as hell getting him a charger so he can play his iPad games during our downtime. 




 My niece was a few months old when she had whooping cough. Was a long hospital stay and you felt helpless just watching her. 




 Same. School is rarely cancelled and the reasons for cancellation was because the schools water pipe's froze or the power went out for the whole town. No matter how cold those school buses still showed up 8:15 to bring everyone to school. 




 Listen to country music. My crush liked traditional country so I started listening to it too. Crush didn't feel the same but I discovered music I actually liked and now only listen to country. 




 Pay off my parent's debts. Get my dad a Harley Davidson motorcycle. He's always talking about getting one some day. As for my mom, she'll get some fancy convertible car. She's always wanted one.
