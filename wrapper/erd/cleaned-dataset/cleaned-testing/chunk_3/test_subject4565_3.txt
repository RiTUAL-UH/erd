 I think I'm with you on that. But who am I to say for sure? Basically what I'm getting at is that the smartest human alive knows essentially nothing in regards to existence and the universe.  




 Therapy, Frank. Seek it.  




 I think someone jizzed in his Farina.  




 I think it all depends on what "version" of God you are thinking about. I don't buy into any of the organized religions, and recognize too many inconsistencies and oxymorons in their teachings. With that being said, I cannot confirm or deny that some form of ultimate creator does or doesn't exist. If some sort of grand architect were to exist, I don't know the specific abilities he may or may not possess. 

Furthermore *what if* **our** creator didn't create the universe entirely? Being that he created us, would he still be considered our God? Or is that term expressly used to describe the finite ultimate intelligence that created everything in existance as we know it?

Where did God come from? Who created it? What existed before God? What is God?  




 So how many people have been killed over the past ~10 years by not globally transitioning from a fossil fuel reliance into fully funded and widespread use of renewable, clean, and alternative energies? 




 True, good points. Any specific reason why you chose to go with a wooden spoon as opposed to just a spoon in general? 




 Well, I mean, *if* God exists, you technically put *yourself* in Hell by not having faith in him during your life and following his teachings to the letter. Maybe it's not so much actually "sending" you to Hell as it is saying you aren't allowed into his Heaven (he has the right to choose, it's his, he created it) because you didn't obey his wishes, and the only alternative to Heaven is a dimension controlled by Satan (Hell). 

(I'm not religious) 




 I don't get the Writing Prompts hate. This is incredibly original and well written. As someone who appreciates great writing and recognizes the difficulty behind it, I don't give two shits if WP posts tend to appear more frequently in /r/bestof than those of other subs. It has a [WritingPrompts] tag so you don't have to be inconvenienced by clicking the link if you don't give a shit about WP posts. The fact that it's being upvoted in /r/bestof means that most people appreciate the content.  




 It's a wooden spoon. In the fiery pits of hell. Sounds like that spoon isn't going to last very long. 

Give me the fucking vacation, and while I'm there, I'll shmooze God into letting me stay. 




 In that case, you must be hungry. Hit up Jims Steaks @ 4th and South. 

Wiz wit, lettuce, mayo, salt   pepper. Do it.

Edit: BTW, you may get a better response rate over at /r/philadelphia. Not many people subscribe to this sub. 




 Civil war! Nice!

Edit: And probably pretty valuable. 




 But first, to the hospital! 




 It was a murder weapon. 




 No biggie. High noon and low noon.  




 Don't be so hard on yourself, man. You seem like a good, introspective dude to me. 




 Not really, because smoking weed changes your metabolic rate and subsequent digestion process. When you smoke for a long time, you develop a consistent pattern in that process. When you stop smoking, your body is essentially just correcting back to normal.
 




 That's not a withdrawl symptom, its just an adjustment to your bodys metabolic rate and subsequent digestion schedule. 




 Heroin kills, bro. 




 This is the honest truth when it comes to marijuana addiction. It's no more addicting than the skittles that I can't seem to stop eating.  




 You are me. Except I'm 29, manage a restaurant, and make like 1/7th of your salary.

You lucky son of a bitch. 




 You Goddamn genius. Brb, going to buy some panty hoes. 




 Get. Out. 




 Microwave it until its crispy. 




 Maybe Pharoh is a relative... 




 There's a sex joke in here somewhere.  




 I'm white and I have nothing but respect for the various Native American cultures and empathy for the hardships they have endured, and still do to this day. 




 Ah yes, a fleet of sailors. Come on in boys, door's open! Don't forget to bring your caulks. We've got some holes that need a fillin'. 




 Well... that explains why I hate it.  




 With... caulk? 




 And that point is? 




 Signs was terrible. Water is your weakness? Let's pick the 70 percent liquid water planet to invade! Also they're smart enough to engineer vehicles for interstellar travel but can't get out of a pantry. 




 Like a couple'a Gushers 




 Wanting kids.

Actively participating in organized religion.

Being unintelligent or significantly lacking common sense. 




 Easy, Duggar. 




 Holes need fillin 




 Good general message on diversity. Except the part where you said 'white folks'. Isn't that doing exactly what you are preaching against?

 Just keep thrusting. 




 What kind of postal fortress was this pic taken at?

Newman? 




 WTF m8. How bout a little elaboration here... 




 Ditto. 




 LOUD NOISES 




 I think technically, if you read the article, they are trying to say that fracking *has not caused widespread damage to the US water supply, and does not pose a threat to do so in the future*. They are saying there have only been a small number of localized contamination issues around certain drill sites. 

Personally I think it is all complete bullshit (politics/money), and there is no doubt that fracking causes major groundwater contamination. There is no reason to believe that this contamination and these chemicals being pumped into the ground will not eventually make their way into larger water sources. 

Simply put; The EPA is bought and sold. This conclusion and article title are both bullshit. This report cannot be trusted and you should probably actually assume the direct opposite of what it's telling you.  




 He said a 'model' of his death beam. It was a 'model' of his death beam. It would not have to be functioning, as a model car would not be functioning.

Tesla, you sly fox. 




 That was beautiful, man. Truly beautiful.  




 Yea. We're fucked. The title of this article basically means, "Fracking definitely fucks up your drinking water." 




 PayPal is a terrible company. I urge anyone reading this to skip their bullshit altogether and use a viable alternative. 




 "Water isn't wet" - EPA 




 As they kick in your neighbors door. 

"DROP THE WEED HIPPIE!"

"I don't even smoke officer..."

"STOP RESISTING!!!" 









 Ohh shiit [7]. When I read the title, I legitimately thought it was strange, and I was briefly inspired with a tiny bit of hope for my country. 

"The US Navy stopped shelling something because it didn't want to hurt some whales? Well that doesn't sound right, but I'm with it!"

Oh what a naive fool I have been.  




 It depends... are you black or hispanic? 




  but perhaps shows that the system is flawed on many, many levels.

THIS is the root of all of our problems.  




 Maybe the military needs to train all of our police? Perhaps you can help them drop their nuts while they learn a few things.  




 probably from the last couple years only 




 My ex and her douche bag fiance are both HS teachers. They work in a very high paying district and he makes somewhere around 80K per year, non-tenured. He has been in the position maybe 5-6 years.  




 Jesus h8's fag whales 




 Good guy Navy. ^^^For ^^^once. 




 $20,000 and counting for his GoFundMe page in around 7 hours. This guy deserves every penny. Fellow Cincinnatians, **keep this guy safe and keep his message alive**.   




 YUM 









 Cause it's F ^I R ^E 




 Good thing I sold mine at 147,000 




 Huh. Blasphemy. FTW will always be Fuck The World in my book.  




 Loosey Goosey!
 




 ... but FTW doesn't mean 'for the win' 




 No, sorry, I think you're confused. This is a drug-free zone.  




 You can still hit the green in regulation 




 Cause it's peeing. Look at that yellow tinge. 




 It's not fake, it's telekinetic. 




 "Forfeiture in the amount of 183,961,921.00 is Ordered." 




 But what if I feed both of my wolves and then put them in a ring like Michael Vick? 




 Yes please for the love of G-O-D

 




 It's a sad state of living.  




 I haven't had my real name for the last 7 years. 

FTW 




 It's Rapeman.  




 How? 




 he ded? 




 Ted Cruz is an N-word 




 Yes. I think there is potential for treatment regarding those diseases, among many many others. On the reveres side, some people say that long term exposure to weed tends to increase the likelihood of developing illnesses such as anxiety and schizophrenia, among other types of psychosis. I think a lot of it is based on genetics. Furthermore, i think there needs to be exponentially more unbiased and regulated studies into the potential medicinal and psychological benefits of marijuana as well as those regarding the potential long term detrimental side-effects. 

I have a personal belief that marijuana has tremendous medicinal and psychological potential. But big pharma can't exactly profit off of a plant that anybody can grow in their basement, which is probably 50+% the reason why it remains illegal.  




 Read the title and noped out before the video even loaded.

 Stretch Armstrong, you sneaky son of a bitch.  




 Precisely...  




 I mean c'mon, guys. It's not like he Roethlisberger'd a chick in a public bathroom.  




 Bro, i think you might be on to something. [7] 




 Ghost in the Shell 




 Not only that, they landed a probe and took soil samples.  




 Someone is PISSED.

Left the dildos on the roof of the car again. 




 I would love to.  




 Hey man, IDK if I can help or not, but I consider myself to be a day sleeper by nature. I just prefer to be awake at night but I can adapt myself to either cycle. 

When sleeping during the day, the most important thing is covering your eyes or eliminating the light source to the room. I will put a headband around my eyes, or the sleeve of a sweatshirt, or a pillow, whatever it takes to block out the light. Also if possible try to get some good shades on the windows.

Next step is, obviously, you have to be tired. To accomplish this, try and pull an all-nighter so that you've been awake for 24 hours. You will notice that you will sort of get a second wind for night 2 and when it comes time for you to sleep, you'll be tired enough to make it happen.

Then it's all about holding that schedule and after a little bit, your body's clock will sync up to compensate.  




 Because of the specific capabilities of their data capturing programs, they can and will essentially monitor EVERYTHING all at once. Don't think of it as individual NSA employees wasting their time monitoring a forum, think of it as a massive data center that basically captures ALL information as it passes through whatever wires/communication hub they are tapping. 

They can then use an algorithm to scan for certain keywords (could be a short list or a very long list) that they deem "ideologically dangerous" or "a threat to national security". All of those instances that the computer algorithm red flags can THEN be investigated by a person in greater detail. They know everything about you. Your patterns, your habits, where you go every day of your life, who you interact with, the foods you eat, the products you buy. You can easily be profiled based on your bank card spending/location data, phone content/location data, and internet browsing habits alone.

Your life history (and basically everyone elses) is on file for future reference. 

Like it or not, if you say certain words or phrases over the phone/internet, or express a pattern of certain behavior that they don't like, you will be on one of their lists.  




 Probably true. Would there be any shrapnel from the initial explosion? 




 Dafuq is happening to this country? 




 Naive, you are. Educate yourself, you must.  




 Benefit to America: NEGATIVE NUMBERS 




 "Uh, sir, there's a live gerbil in here."

"Hey Jim Bob, is that against the rules?" 




 WTF bro! Now the TSA is going to start "screening" the lines at football stadiums! 




 Got a problem? Nothin' that can't be solved with mo' asshole checks.  




 And the TSA didn't take mankind to another celestial body. 




 Daddy, NO! 




 Next up...

*Breaking News, Read All About It:*

**Top 5 U.S. Bottled Water Producers Have Been Donating Hundreds Of Millions To The TSA In Latest Confiscation For Profit Scandal.** 




 According to Cit 4, at time of production the number of people on various stages of their "lists" was about 1.2 million. Current US population is prob about 325 million. 

It would be easy to say that given the time that has passed since the doc was filmed, the watch-list could have grown to at least 3.25 million. So as a safe bet, at minimum, 1% of the population (1 in 100 people) are being actively monitored to some level or extent.  




  they really screwed him

Literally or figuratively? Explain.  




  ~~scaring the shit out of someone?~~

killing the shit out of someone?

 




  TSA took the nail file, but let me keep the knife and scissors.

Yep. Sounds about right.
