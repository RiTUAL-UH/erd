 Ride one. Ride this one, then tell me how joyless it is! I was blown away. 




 Wait til ya ride one. I love me some dinosaur burners, but this was one of the most exciting things I've ridden in years. 









 Yeah but it's more like 'yes sweep til Brooklyn.' 




 Ctrl-F "stromile"

All is in order, thank you. 




 Haha bring it on! My brother and I did an hour long dick song show last year. It's a labour of love. Get her to link me done tunes! 




 Please show this to your daughter, I feel we may be kindred spirits.

 Reporting for duty, where do I queue? 




 Green skinned Aussie here, can confirm.  




 Thunder would appear to have the edge, but dare I say DeAndre Jordan might be a big factor? Dude is acting like a 7 foot Rodman lately. 




 What they need is a coach who can better utilize Howard and Lin in a pick and roll offense. I hear D'Antoni is available. 




 Oh, I dunno, because he was playing like a sack of shit all series? 




 Not to mention, KD had been shooting like absolute faeces for the entire game, missing just about everything. 




 I gotta say it, Durant has looked like a piece of shit in this series.  




 That... That's actually pretty fantastic. 




 I choose not to be dragged down by the cynicism of this video. Instead I shall marvel at the gorgeous camerawork and sweet editing. 




 You smoke flavoured tobacco in those things for like 45 minutes at a time. I can't believe that wouldn't make a big difference to your energy levels in an overtime game. 




 /r/asmr ;) 




 I think it's more likely to go fungal, but we'll see! 




 Fair call. Unfortunately lyrics and melody are very tired together for me. Maybe this is just my dick period.

 I'm amazed I got the "honeymooner's choice" line past my editor in the Multistrada one... :P 




 Close - just north of Melbourne, Australia. 




 Not the missus, but one of her friends. I've banned the missus from getting on the back, she fell asleep in the twisties a couple of times and my ego couldn't take it. :P 




 She's fine. But yeah, I don't think she's real keen to get back on again. She had no idea when it happened, but when she saw the tape, she nearly crapped herself. 




 Cheers mate! We're going to get back into them in the next few months. :) 




 Aye, it looks tight as a motherfucker. Is that how the drag guys run them? 




 They made some absolutely shithouse chemistry moves when they dealt Granger and picked up Turner and Bynum. Heart and soul got replaced by a pair of me-first bastards. 




 Dwight and Lopez look weirdly uncoordinated on offense. Dwight's hook looks so stiff and strange.  




 *dominant 




 There's been a few similar threads on Reddit with people admitting they've got the attraction and are trying like hell never to act on it. What a tough hand to be dealt. 




 He also works his arse off, to be fair.  




 Ya mean white balance? 




 I feel like there's an equivalent Austin Powers gif just waiting to get made. 




 There were sure some amazing characters back then. Gods like Jordan, villains like Laimbeer, and a complete alien like Rodman the likes of which we won't see again.  




 Well, they still dribble up and down the court, so I'd like to see that included. 




 What a great video! 




 I dunno, he seems like a nice guy, but a total clown. A lot like Dwight Howard in that regard.  




 Wishful thinking I reckon. Consistency ain't his game.  




 Those things are pure horn in the metal. 




 That is some serious skill. Not a great bike for doing stoppies on, and he's just owning it! 




 Refurbished macbook pro?  









 Greatest that ever lived. 




 Durant looked very ordinary out there for most of that game. Almost seemed like he was pushing to get to his 25 points. 




 That's the problem here - the Spurs have a better chance of beating the Heat. Just let 'em through already. 




 I've taken pairs of tyres to the shop like that. Gotta plan ahead a bit in traffic! A mate then asked how to move a tyre I was giving him, and I told him to put his arms up and slip it over his head. Had him stuck like that for about 5 minutes while I rolled around laughing. Pro tip: stand in the tyre and pull it up around your waist! 




 As an Aussie, it's absolutely worthy of comment. Any sports stars over here that behaved like that would be treated with the kind of scorn Americans seem to reserve for Justin Bieber. 




 Metta's Champions thing was alright. Is he "active?"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjEUAtEisc4 




 Or are they just really missing Granger? 




 I'd agree with this. If you've got the time and skills to grade all your footage, then go ahead and shoot cinestyle. But it adds time to the process, and unless you know what you're doing, it actually makes the footage look worse than standard. I've gone back to shooting a lot of my stuff on standard because clients can't tell the difference and it's heaps quicker. 




 Well will ya look at that date! 




 It's the ring of faeeeeeceeeees... 




 I had a hornet 919 years ago, ripping bike, loved it. Might even prefer it to the FZS1000 at the end of the day! But ya gotta run what ya brung as they say!  




 Yep, the 2002. Need to keep it revving like mad to keep up with the big twins I'm chasing! Could do with some bottom end.  









 They absolutely fucked that piece of road up.  




 I dunno... Show me the data.  




 Barkley was an energy-filled hate machine of intimidation. He went hard as a motherfucker with full intensity on every play. 




 Bought it. Watched it. It's got a few moments but it's not awesome.  




 Dear god. 




 Can you say that five times fast?  




 My theory is that people see crystal clear photos and don't have the emotional response that they get from old photos. A lot of stylistic processing emulates the problems inherent in shit cameras, old film or old photos and that resonates with people's desire to reminisce. It gives the photos a kind of aged credibility. It's odd.  




 That's the "Chuck a Wheelie" signal.  




 WHOSE GAME IS IT? IT'S MICHAEL JORDAN'S GAME!  




 WITHOUT THE BASKETBAAAAALLLLL 




 Nigga on, if that's what gets you through the day. 




 Be... cause I didn't see that?  :P 









 Here, I knocked this up. Hope it helps!

 OK I'll put something together. 




 Honestly the bars and big eyes make it look a bit like a sad elephant. But I bet it's nicer to ride already.  




 Let's not forget, whichever porn star he chooses to rail will be made well aware that he's the slut shaming asshole that outed one of their colleagues. It will not go well for him.  




 YOU FOOL. YOU WILL KILL THIS SUBREDDIT WITH TALK LIKE THAT!  




 It's incredibly easy, super intuitive and extremely fast - even faster when you're dealing with a stack of shots. There's still things that PS is handy for, but LR absolutely shits on it for file handling, choosing your keepers, getting a basic look, doing your crops, etc etc etc. 




 And the league and the ticket buying public can't be sure one team or the other's just not going to bring half their squad. Pop reaps what he sows. 




 On my mobile right now but it's pretty intuitive. It's under lens corrections/color.  




 The primes give the best looking photos, but I can't get by without my 24-105. I probably take 90% of my shots with it. 




 It's a brilliant lens but pretty limited in scope. Probably makes my favourite images, but I'm not gonna take it out on a walk around! 




 Lightroom kills CA very effectively, you can spend a little tie and make absolutely sure you've got rid of it on your keepers. 




 Mine too. It flies.  




 Appreciated! (I think I've fucked it) :) 




 I've always thought he was a straight up knob. 




 Why's that?  




 Symptoms are as follows: Lens seems to work normally at 24mm, but as you zoom in, the IS and aperture start to jump around wildly. I believe this is an issue with the flexible communications ribbon that connects to the aperture control ring. Canon Australia wants $480 to repair it... That's ludicrous, especially given that you can get a whole new lens for $700 in some places.

I've found a second hand aperture ring with a new ribbon soldered on and I want to have a crack at making the repair, but I understand it's easy to knock certain lens elements out of alignment in the process. Has anyone opened one of these lenses up, and do you have any tips for me? 




 Old fixer upper motorcycle. 




 Mirror? 




 Anyone ever yells that at you, I got bad news for ya. Or good news, depending... 




 That was great! 




 What about "I'm... We're..." and "As if you'd ever take responsibility for something!"

 




 Penis. 




 Wow. :) 




 Sweet baby jesus that was good.  




 Nice shot... I assume you've got in and cropped it as straight as you can, and fiddled with the distortion controls? If so, you might need to fire this one into Photoshop and play with the skew or perspective tools. 




 You guys woulda held on if it wasn't for the okc defense though. That 12-0 run had a stack of forced turnovers in it.  




 Just chuck it in and go! FCPX is awesome with DSLR video.  




 *dominant 




 HGGGGNNNNNNNGGGGGHHHHH

*spaff*

Two, please. One with a flat bar. 




 A vow of positivity... I should look into that, I'm a grumpy cunt. 




 I'd go a step further and name him as the greatest single sportsman of the modern era. Better and more transcendent than Rossi, Federer, Schumacher, Tiger, Beckham... Maybe there's an argument for Wayne Gretzky, but ice hockey is a much less global sport than basketball.

Good god. 




 Funny how these things keep showing up around dunk contest time. 




 All this "I'm not doing the dunk contest, but look at me anyway" stuff is bullshit. Put up or shut up. 




 Yeah but it sort of fell flat. 




 I remember MJ saying something that really resonated with me - something along the lines that every night, there was some kid up in the stands who was only ever going to get one chance to see him play. He said he played every night for that kid, so he could never take a night off. 




 And yet look at who the heat lose to. 




 Similar to the way LeBron's regular season coasting will tarnish his legacy. 




 I can tell you I got the Canon 135 recently and it's an absolute ripper. Sharp, separates the background beautifully and focuses very fast. And half the price.  




 For sure, but if your auto focus system is losing you shots and getting you into trouble with clients... 




 Except... Most of those are deeply ordinary pictures, I see nothing that makes me want to give up my DSLR.  




 Yes, but he had that whole thing going where he sort of loped about at half pace, keeping up with everyone, and then exploded when he wanted to. Extraordinary motor. 




 Fucking hell, it feels like Stern had been on his last couple of days for about two years!  




 YEAH IT WAS ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY TOOK BENNETT DOWN A PEG. 




 It's a beast unless she shoots fast action stuff, in which case it's only awesome. 




 So much can happen though. KD could snap like a twig in a winning WCF game 7. You've got to be in it to win it, and the pathetic East more or less hands the ECF to Miami with only one decent team in the way.
