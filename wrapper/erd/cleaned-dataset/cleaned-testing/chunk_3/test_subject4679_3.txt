 Thank you for these. Clockwork Yellow: You can see where this is going, obviously. One of the surprising things for many people is how many of these strategies we are using despite KNOWING they will make us feel worse. We don't INTEND to feel worse, so something else is going on. Anyway, I don't want to prejudice others who might reply. Other ideas, anyone? 




 I'm a psychologist and author (Your Depression Map) and would appreciate some help from any of you who might be interested.

Throughout our lives, much of our behaviour is designed with the ultimate goal of creating a positive emotional state - in effect, I want the better job, the cream cheese bagel, the Hawaiian holiday, even a sense of meaning in purpose BECAUSE I believe that if I get those things I will be happy/content/joyful/etc.

We spend our lives oriented in this one direction, and often seem to miss the target: we don't feel all that happy. Would we be any more accurate if we deliberately tried to be UNHAPPY instead? And what might we do if the agenda was to feel unhappy that we are already doing for some reason or another?

So here's the deal:  

Imagine that 10 days from now you could win a large sum of money (in my groups, we make it $10 million - what the heck, it's imaginary) if you could make yourself more unhappy on that day than you are now.  

The fine print: You can only do or change THREE things (maximum) in your mind or life. And you can't list anything that's not in your own power to do (no alien invasions, no global economic meltdowns). We give you 10 days, because maybe some of your strategies won't work right away and require some time to build up.

In return, I'll tabulate the answers and report back to this subreddit. (I've elaborated on this topic a bit more on my blog, but this post has all you need. The blog is at  http://www.psychologysalon.com/2013/04/what-if-you-wanted-to-be-unhappy.html)  Thanks!

 Hey Redditors,
I'm a psychologist and author (Your Depression Map) and would appreciate some help from any of you who might be interested. 

Folks with depression spend a huge amount of effort trying to feel better and often feel that their progress is slow or nonexistent. But what if the goal was to go the other way - what would you do?

Imagine that 10 days from now you could win a large sum of money (in my groups, we make it $10 million - what the heck, it's imaginary) if you could make yourself MORE depressed for that 10th day than you have been for the past week.

The fine print: You can only do or change three things in your mind or life. And you can't list anything that's not in your own power to do (no alien invasions, no global economic meltdowns). We give you 10 days, because maybe some of your strategies won't work right away and require some time to build up.

I know, I know: No amount of money is worth it, etc. But thankfully it's a thought experiment, not a contract. And sometimes looking at what we could be doing to make it worse (and aren't) can help us see what we are actually accomplishing.

Anyway, that's my pitch. In return, I'll tabulate the answers and report back to this subreddit.  Thanks!

 What bimmeric has spontaneously invented for him/herself is an approach called "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy" - the core of which is to demote emotions from their positions as masters and dictators of behaviour to the position of experiences and companions. ACT is extremely helpful for depression. 




 Keeping your goals high - what you "should be able to do" - will result, by nightfall every day, in a sense of defeat. Look at what you ACTUALLY accomplish most days.  Then create a short list of items that includes those things - even the things you already get yourself to do, like showering or getting out of bed by 3 pm. When you do something, no matter how trivial or ridiculous it seems to your self-critical mind, acknowledge that you did it and focus on that. 

If you focus on what you have not accomplished, your emotions will reflect discouragement.

If you focus on what you DO accomplish, your emotions will correspondingly reflect encouragement. The boost will be small, and may be wiped out altogether until you master the knack of talking back to the dismissive part of the mind. 

When a task seems overwhelming, it is always telling you the same thing.  "Make me smaller." 




 BTW: I recently posted in the Depression forum a link so that people can get a free copy of the Antidepressant Skills Workbook, a written-in-Vancouver (but exported around the world) guide designed for physicians to offer to depressed patients - but also for anyone to download on their own. Here's the link that'll get you to the download sites: http://www.changeways.com/resources/aboutdepression/scdp/scdp.html

One more free thing: I have an online course on diaphragmatic breathing available on Udemy. The usual charge is $15, but redditers can sign up for the course using the Coupon Code "breathingreddit" and get it for free until the end of April. Link: https://www.udemy.com/breathing-made-easy/

Breathe easy, redditers. 









 Thanks for the ideas, all.  I'm not a huge pubgoer but when the occasion arises it's often hard to think of a spot that doesn't assume its patrons are incapable of talking. 




 What is it with Vancouver pubs and restaurants and the televisions? If I wanted to watch TV I'd stay at home, and the ubiquitous flashing televisions are a distraction from anything else.  

So redditors: Is there a good Vancouver pub that has enough confidence in itself that it DOESN'T have television?
