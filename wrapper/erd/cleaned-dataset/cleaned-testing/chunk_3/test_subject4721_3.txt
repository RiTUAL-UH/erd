 Nice but what does the salami taste like smoked? Can you give a brief description? 




 It could also be something like this http://imgur.com/a/nbd16 that I saw at Smorgasbord a while back. 




 Been going the last few years and I happy it's in Brooklyn this year. I just checked, where do you use the promo code? 




 Been there and done that but not at Sonic. Sometimes you just gotta lay down or pass out and believe me it's cleaner than the floor.

 Amelia because there's a theory that she was pregnant at the time of the flight but her and her businessman husband had so many endorsement deals that would be cancelled if she cancelled the flight, Elvis because Elvis was tired of being Elvis and Andy because he thinks it would be the funniest thing ever.  




 Just wondering? 




 That's what I said. 




 It was just a smart funny quick read. It's her story about dating in LA, her closeted gay "boyfriends", her ex who she lived together with for five years and who wrote a book calling her my fatassed girlfriend and sharing their stories without warning her and her version of their time together. It was just a funny honest look at herself and her love life and her struggle with the death of her beloved cat Emmit and having gone through a similar event with my wife's cat Noodles I could relate. I read it in a day and was just so enamored of it that when I finished it I tried the email address she had in the book to thank her for the nice few hours she had just given me and for her work on one of my favorite TV shows "My Name is Earl" and she answered back the next day! Here's a link to a story about her ex's books http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/fashion/chad-kultgens-uncensored-voice-takes-a-more-serious-tone.html?pagewanted=all and here is her page I found after reading the book http://hilarywinston.com/home/ All in all a very nice thrift store find indeed. Interested in a trade? 









 OK No problem but as you can see I did karmadecay it before I posted. It's not worth arguing about. It's gone and have a good day. 



















 Ok your right, thanks. It's gone. 




 She was a writer on My Name is Earl and is now writing for Community. I can't praise her book enough!

 I hear you. I was watching a tv show and someone had an original picture of this framed on their wall and that's where they said it's from and when I came across it this morning I just had to post it. Still cool tho.

 There's a discounted 80 hour course offered online and I was wondering if it was worth while to even consider taking it. It seems legit and I was wondering if anybody else had anything good to say about it. 




 Had a good/bad experience? 




 There's one available, 80 hours online and I was wondering if it would be worth it even at a discount. I believe there's a novel in me that wants to be told.

 In a fit of road rage I followed a guy from Brooklyn through Manhattan into New Jersey because I saw my bus high beams were really annoying him. BTW I was heading home to Brooklyn. ;) 




 it's there, thanks.

 BAM! Obscure movie reference and on Oscar night too! Sweet! 




 I know, i was hoping that someone would know what happened and post it. 




 Just found this subreddit, does this count? 




 Simple can be powerful. 




 I didn't hate him but I knew I was going to have to hurt him before school let out for the summer. 




 It's his home and I agree I have no idea what I was thinking when I came up with that title. Drugs maybe? 




 I agree, we were lucky. I tell my nieces and nephews about having to carry gallon jugs down to the end of the road to the water pump and pump water to fill the jugs so we could eat and drink.
