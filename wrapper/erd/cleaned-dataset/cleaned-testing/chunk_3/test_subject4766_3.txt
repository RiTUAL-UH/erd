 Anyone want to guess where Thor and Hulk will be during this? I'm guessing Thor will be in Asgard dealing with Loki and trying to find out what happened to Odin and Hulk will possibly be off world? on his own intergalactic adventure if the rumors are to be believed. 
 














 The original release of GTA 5. I think the game was impossible to get on ether the 360 or ps3 for at least a week. At least in my area.  



















 Its still spider-man though. They don't have to market Miles Morales they just have to market spider-man.  




 If marvel and sony struck a deal to have Spider-Man in civil war but it was Miles Morales and not Peter Parker. How do you think people would react? would people care? I mean its still spider-man just not Peter Parker 




 I think a really cool franchise could be made out of Inception. It could be like the matrix mixed with a bit of bond/mission impossible action along with some spy thriller elements.And if they couldn't get DiCaprio to return then it could focus on the other members of the team and have the second and third film follow them around on other extraction jobs with an over arcing plot involving some sort of government conspiracy and cyber criminals and terrorists where they extract or plant ideas to prevent attacks and catch criminals etc. Any other ideas? 




 What on earth did I just watch? is this a porno? 




 it's gonna get a bit bumpy. 




 can we stop with the whole no pre order thing. this forum is about 5% of the total pc community. So its pointless telling people not to pre order it wont make a difference.  




 Interstellar would make a pretty sweet game.  














 This seems to be the "cool" answer to any half life 3 related post these days. But we all know you will still buy it day 1.  




 Halo and the possibility of a new Gears of war game in the future was my reason. I'm hoping microsoft will announce something awesome at this years E3 to make the purchase worth while other wise its just gathering dust.  









 they love it because it makes them feel special when they can say "my platform has this game so it must be better than your platform" and it also helps them justify their purchase even when they wont admit how crappy the console actually is.  









 Does anyone have any idea why marvel seem to have put it on the back burner for now? Everyone seemed damn sure we would get one in phase 3 but we didn't and now it looks like we might not even get one in phase 4. It looks like the Hulk will continue to be a supporting character in the avengers films which is kind of sad that marvel seem to be wasting Marks talent by using him once every 2-3 years for avengers films. Look I get that the Hulk isn't exactly an easy character to make a movie about due to him being a sort of anti hero if you will and it can be difficult to balance between Banner and Hulk but come on marvel give Hulk some love in phase 4 please! 




 Plus he lost to star lord in a humiliating dance off so who would want to return after that? 




 Your not gonna get that performance at $100. if you can add $40 you can get a 750ti.

 I read the 960 uses 120w max at laod. So would a 500w psu be enough for SLI? 




 he said buses haha.  




 370x is probably gonna be a beast.  









 OP has bad taste. 




 are you sure you saw John Wick? because the John Wick I saw was bloody awesome. Beautifully shot and had one of Keanu Reeve's best performances.  




 I finally got to see it yesterday and I think it may be Michael Caine's best performance yet. That scene where Murph visits Professor Brand in hospital just before he dies, I was holding back man tears. Time and time again Caine continues to impress and Nolan keeps bringing out the best in Caine. Looking forward to what he does next.  




 lame spot. its all seen it , been there.  




 Can someone explain the ending as simple as possible because I got a bit confused when we get the bit where cooper appears to fall in to the black hole and time itself and how he communicates with his daughter through the watch. just want some clarification on it.  




 bullshit. no way it will make it close to mockingjay or guardians.  




 Noooo!  




 Do we know for sure that this is going to be about the bounty hunters stealing the death star plans? I heard a few other sites saying that its going to be the Han Solo film? 




 I think the court room drama has actually been the most entertaining stuff so far.  




 Totally agree. I hope they do a sequel.  




 Fool of a took!  




 old post is old.  









 I might. I'm not a HUGE fan of the RE games but I enjoyed them for what they are.  




 i say its Merlin cause in the promo you see him talking to team arrow and he presents the weapon Raz used to kill oliver. So how could of he gotten it if he wasn't there? 




 My planet just got Annihilated 




 You have to say it in the awesome Korean accent!  




 I'm guessing its Merlin.  




 aw 




 With Oliver potentially out of the picture for a while will Felicity give Barry a heads up on what happened?  




 Oliver will be dead the rest of the season until next season when Barry goes back in time and saves him.  




 Plot twist. They do another arrow vs flash crossover where barry goes back in time and saves him.  




 To be fair I didnt even notice till I saw this. So they must of done something right.  









 run some benchmarks for a an hour or so and check the temps.  




 yea this is a really interesting site. You can find other game companies on it to even VALVE.  




 sure you were drunk...  




 aye, its $109 on psn and xbox live.  




 wont work. they will deny your credit/debit card.  




 I enjoyed it. A lot of people are saying its average and doesn't deserve all the Oscar nominations it got but I disagree I think it does. Its a great film and its one of Bradley Coopers best performances. I hope ether American Sniper or Whiplash win Best picture.  









 its like the matrix meets superman.  









 The only reason Boyhood might win imo is because of the whole 12 year process behind it and Birdman wont win because its such a mixed bag. You ether like it or dislike it. Mean while Whiplash is more grounded and has great performances all round and its got the technical awards behind it to for best editing and sound which past best picture winners usually have as well.  




 Everyone seems to think whiplash is the under dog this year. Saying their happy its been nominated but no way it will win. I actually think it might. Anyone else?  




 even if thats the case it will pop up some where else quick enough.  




 cant tell if sarcasm or serious....  




 and me  




 unless you know someone in china who could buy it for you and  then gift it to you then yea your probably out of luck.  




 Under the mountain. I know Sam Neil did that real budget looking film but it was kinda crap. Would like to see a proper franchise made out of it.  




 Just buy the pc bro. your only going to more douche bags here trying to force you to build one.  




 If you dont want to build one dont. Ill get down voted for saying that but its your money and if your more comfortable getting a pre built then get it. Cyber pc are great. Highly Recommend.  














 yea the unfortunate side effects of ageing. I think DOFP was probably the last time well see these two together on screen as X-Men.  




 how long did you test it for? you can test for over 10 hours and still have an unstable overclock. These sound like symptoms of a bad oc.  




 It obviously means your oc is not stable.  









 anyone else think they should of attached it to ant-man instead? that movie could of done with the boost of ticket sales. Avengers 2 doesnt need the extra box office its already going to be a hit.  




 There has been an awakening, have you felt it? 









 So Im a bit confused about the time line in the upcoming x-men apocalypse film. Since everything has been reset in DOFP. Does apocalypse take place in a new universe post time line reset or is it before the reset? Im guessing its before since the original cast wont be returning because all of the x-men will be too young for the original actors . But its been confirmed for a while now that Hugh Jackman will return as Wolverine. So how does that work ? or will it be like DOFP and some of it will be in the past and future at the same time? 




 its their money they can spend it how they wish.  



















 I think they sometimes do an easter sale cant verify that tho.  




 he could saved up for a couple months on a really tight budget? you dont know his current circumstances.  




 Matthew Vaughn Approves this shit! 




 Welp I could log in and get to the server list now its back to the way it was before, I cant even log in.  




 But the wait time is over an hour and half. WTF.  




 So I bought the game on steam and now im having trouble making an account. Do I have to use the same email as my steam account and do I have to use the same username as my steam account or not? im kinda confused. Because its saying my account doesnt have access.  




 Sony Offline Entertainment 




 I think it might of been too "out there" for the academy if that makes sense and it doesn't help that it wasnt released during oscar season.  









 Been trying for the last hour, no luck. Is anyone besides a couple of twitch streamers actually playing? 




 the entire franchise hinges on her being in the movie! 




 Just watched the film and im just wondering about the end. Did the investigation ever find out why the veteran Chris was helping killed him? I want to avoid going into conspiracy theories if possible but Im just curious about what happened.  









 what a weird month to push it back to. Like I can understand wanting to be on oscar season but why not November? Their brave releasing it so close to star wars. 




 http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/sherlock-season-4-2015-special-4-episode-1201256929/

The new season will consist of a special episode, which will begin filming in January 2015, and three episodes, which will commence production later in the year and will likely appear in early 2016. 




 season 4 will film later this year. when it airs idk. Right now their just filming the special.  




 i liked the amazing spiderman 2 so i actually want a third film.  




 inb4 left 4 dead is actually the superior game lmao.  














 Avatar

This trailer was beautifully put together, its a shame the movie didn't quite live up to the hype that came from it. Still enjoyed the final product tho. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PSNL1qE6VY

Spiderman 3

This trailer got me so damn excited for venom and it still does. Just wish they could of done better by the character. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bzqHbTD64w

Inception

As great as inception was I still think its trailers were better than the movie itself especially this one the action, music and sound design in the trailer was miles above anything that was actually featured in the movie itself.  Still a great film tho again another one that was way over hyped thanks to a great trailer. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66TuSJo4dZM
 




 I hope whiplash gets nominated for best picture.  









 I wont believe it till we get an official announcement. Ive been burned too many times by latino review. Id say there's a 50% chance is this is legit but wait till something official.  









 http://www.nintendo.com/nintendo-direct/01-14-2015/

Do you think well get any information regarding the 2015 pokemon game? or is it too soon? 




 I kinda wish Brandon Routh wasnt cast as the atom now that way he could of been superman in supergirl.  




 noo! are you crazy? the ending was phenomenal the way it is!  




 fuck, for some reason I first read this as avengers 2. Almost gave me a heart attack.  




 Would you ever consider directing a super hero movie for ether marvel or DC?  









 He was obviously joking you people need to learn how to detect sarcasm.  














 that's probably the truth of it to be honest It doesn't make financial sense for rockstar to have a team as large as the console development team working on a pc version they probably have like 5-10 guys working on the pc port who have no knowledge of how the pc architecture actually works they just assume that everything will translate smoothly because of the x86 architecture used on the new consoles but now their finding out that its actually not that easy.  




 you cant be stupid enough to think he was being serious? 




 it kind of is. I mean if you look back at something like the watchdogs delay that was like what a whole 6 months? to compare to something like that 2 months is a slight shift i guess its just how one interprets it.  




 I cant believe you people thought he was actually serious. He was obviously joking.  




 If I had to pick one Id say its because March is the end of their fiscal year so its just all 'money money money. 
 




 he was obviously joking , did you actually think he was serious? no one would ever do that.  




 I already have a ps4 and xbox one along with my pc. So it doesnt really matter.  




 Heck no. If your getting fps issues the problem lies else where.  




 the people having performance issues are the ones who have bottle necking issues. Their cpu is probably not up to the task. Like dont do something stupid and pair a 970 with a pentium cpu. ofc you will get bottle neck.  









 I will still buy it on PC when it comes out dont worry about that I just really want to play it right now. ive been waiting since last year when it came out on ps4/xb1.  









 I said to myself if it was delayed again Im gonna give on the pc version and just get it on console and that's exactly what Im doing. sorry guys but **** this. Im getting it on ps4 next week. Ive waited long enough to play this.  




 their talking about cpu cores.  




 I said to myself that if it was delayed again im gonna  give up on the pc version and get it on console and that's exactly what Im doing. sorry guys but **** this. Im getting it on ps4 next week. that's just how it is. I still have my pc but its time like these where my faith in Gaben tested. 




 Well I said to myself if it was delayed again ill give up get it on console and that's exactly what Im doing. sorry guys but **** this. Im getting it on ps4 next week.  




 Yes it does! the ending was too open ended, I want to see Christopher return with a huge as army of prawns and **** shit up.  




 ok here are some of mine.  

Star Wars will flop and all of Disney's future plans for the franchise are scrapped it becomes the biggest flop of all time. 

Furious 7 will be another smash hit in the fast and furious franchise spawning 3 more sequels. set for release in 2017,2019,2021 respectively. 

Avengers age of ultron will top  avatars 2 billion dollars at the Box office. the huge success will cause marvel to change some of its phase 3 plans and bring avengers infinity war part 1 forward to 2017 and part 2 in 2018. The other films will have their dates shifted slightly but phase 3 will remain intact. 

Ant-Man will be a surprise hit. Marvel will announce a sequel but will not give a release date. Many will suspect it wont be released until phase 4. 

In February Marvel and Sony announce that Spiderman will return to marvel with a new trilogy of films, the first film will be announced for 2017 starring Andrew Garfield, Garfield will also feature in avengers infinity parts 1 and 2 with a cameo in Captain America: Civil War. As part of the deal sony will get a portion of the box office earnings.  

The Avatar sequels finally begin principal photography in Wellington, New Zealand. 

After the huge success of the final hobbit film. At comic con 2015 Warner bros announces a middle earth cinematic universe.Peter Jackson will be the creative visionary behind the universe he will be the WB version of Kevin Feige, the first film will be a trilogy of films based on the origin of the Witch King of Angmar the first film would release in 2017. 

At comic con 2015 warner bros announces that batman v superman is split into 2 films with part 1 releasing in October and part 2 in march. 

Fantastic Four is another surprise hit. making around $450 million at the box office. Fox is slightly disappointed but they still go a head with the sequel and believe they can make this new iteration of Fantastic Four into a money making franchise.  




 What an awesome movie. Beautifully shot. Especially the fight scene at the end reminded me a bit of the neo vs smith fight from the matrix with the rain and lightning in the background. So good.  This movie may have rebooted Keanu Reeves career in the best way possible. Lets hope he takes advantage of this success and we see him in more of these roles.  




 yea boi! NZ bros! 




 Doesnt this line from stark basically confirm he's the one who makes ultron? 









 I think the recording is gonna play a big part in the trial now.  









 Im going on holiday in Bali for a week in February from the 11th to the 18th which means Ill be missing out about a week of my course. Since I receive living costs and have an active Student Loan, will I need to contact them even though its just a week?  




 Comes out in April for me! so hyped.  




 April master race! so hyped! 




 yea it is.  









 Since bay is apparently out, they will need to having someone already working on it if they plan to make the projected 2016 release date. Any ideas who they might of picked? 




 Ive had it on my battle net account for a while but never bothered to give it a try. is it any good? worth trying out? 




 Furious 7.  




 There's still time to announce a delay.  




 I like how it acknowledges that its a parody of a Hollywood blockbuster. 




 it's not in the same universe so it doesn't matter.  




 Hes got a very particular set of skills,skills he has acquired over a very long career. so why not use them? let him do taken 4 imo 




 After seeing Whiplash I think he could pull it off. At times his character felt very isolated and was dealing with his own personal issues just like peter parker does and he played that very well. Not sure how well he would pull off spiderman tho. I've only seen him in whiplash so maybe someone else can chime in with their thoughts.  




 This just getting ridiculous and out of hand. Poor bloke needs help.  




 you can see the detail must be running at ultra, 4k, 60 fps. 









 you'd be surprised what they spoil in trailers these days. I would not be surprised at all if they spoiled something like that and used it as the big money shot of the trailer.  




 that makes no sense? if the game is on steam then the keys should be able to activate on it? 




 you know hes probably joking about buying the game right? 




 if its not delayed we should get something within the next 2 weeks. tho knowing rockstar we might not get anything till the day it comes out.  




 there's still 2 weeks till release calm your tits.  




 That is clean.  




 I check it every 5 minutes! 




 im talking about sam betraying rogers to team up with stark in civil war. This has nothing to do with Hydra.  




  .

that could actually make a really cool plot. Imagine the look of betrayal on rogers face when his second best friend next to buck betrays him. 




 You have to remember that what happens to Odin all depends whether or not Anthony Hopkins decides to return for Thor: Ragnarok.If he returns then obviously he could be alive just in Odin sleep or if he doesnt return then they have an excuse to kill him off.  




 I actually like SC 2013 come at me bro 




 DAMN IT I FELL FOR IT! 




 Shouldn't the game have gone gold by now? why haven't we heard anything about the pc version finishing development? 




 we just got the witcher 3 requirements and that's not out till May. Something is going on here and I don't like the Silence.  




 Does anyone find it weird steam still says early 2015 and not january 27th? Normally games this close to release have a countdown showing how much time their is till release. Maybe rockstar isnt putting january 27th on the steam page in case they do need to delay?  




 Been a while since I last heard news about it. Is it still happening? 




 your doing it wrong man. i live in New Zealand and never pay more than $65 for a new release game. And games are expensive as shit here. Thank GabeN for online Key stores.  




 what on GabeN's earth is this? no offence but this is a terrible build. You can do a lot better for that price. Hope you didnt buy this yet. This one is better. http://pcpartpicker.com/b/ZB9WGX 




 Dude Ikr! the GOW1 port is so good. It runs really well. Makes me sad Cliffy B never put the second or third game on pc cause of pirating.  




 we need to show developers that we support pc games. Too many developers are scared of putting their games on pc cause of people downloading them and if we ever want halo or gears of war back on pc gta v will need to do well in sales to convince other developers that the pc game market is still strong and that its worth the time and money to have an extra team during development to make a pc port.  









 I remember back in high school stealing chocolate bars from my local super market and putting them down mah pants...back in the day. I was young and shit and quite the rebel to ,hehe.i remember being pretty good at it to tbh. I also remember getting away with some whipped cream and later spraying some of it all over some poor buggers car and then threw it down a ditch some where on my home. I also remember getting a way with a copy of Command and Conquer tiberian sun from a local computer store. 




 This movie is awesome.I loved the animation and Baymax was an awesome character. Hope they do a sequel and this is easily in my top 10 movies of 2014. 




 Na the ending will more than likely involve ether Fury,Stark or Rogers visiting him and offering him to join the avengers.  




 All disney have said is holiday 2015 so around the time the force awakens is released.  




 use pcsx2 and play em? 




 up vote for dat edginess.  




 After seeing whiplash him being in spiderman 2 made me appreciate that movie a little more.  




 Before Iron Man 3 came out I remember reading that Disney decided against using the Demon in a bottle story line and went with PTSD instead.Any idea why it didn't make the final cut? I'm still kinda hoping we get some hints or nods of Demon in a bottle in future films especially with Civil   Infinity War coming up.  









 ill probably get downvoted for this but wouldnt it be bad for their sponsorship with antec to do this? 




 Damn the reference cooler is sexy as hell.  









 your cpu is a bit of a bottle neck.  




 this is my favorite part of attack of the clones.  









 I would of also cut the joke at the end about changing the name. it still ruins a other wise seriously toned trailer. But other wise good job :) 




 This looks awesome! There is no stopping marvel now boys!  




 These things are pointless imo.  




 Isn't it supposed to be out by now? 




 because it would of been weird. seeing the guy who's gonna be vision in the future playing a character in the past 




 Maybe next year ill get a 4k TV. Hopefully by then they'll drop in price.
