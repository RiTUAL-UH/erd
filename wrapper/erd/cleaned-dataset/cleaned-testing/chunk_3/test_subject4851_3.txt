 1. Why not take out Hitler instead of shipping the Jews? There were a hand full of people pivotal to the Nazi movement, why not just take them out? Or better, prevent their births?
2.Why not prevent the wars?
Once you start to change anything, you alter the course of history. The future as we know it will no longer exists.
The wars will be inevitable. And wherever it is you ship the Jews to, it is likely they will meet the same fate in the hands of another.

I think the approach of trickles over time will work. But when you start to make 'changes' then I don't think it will work out so well. 




 You have put a lot of thought into this, haven't you? Gold week deserved. 




 We are in agreement on this very point.
It should be that every one gets the proper training and directed guidance customized to them. And not in a one-sided manner. Education in a a broader sense. Basically equipping them whatever they need for a given type of work as well as for being a human being. This should include also intangible things. 




 Your argument is duly noted. 




 These are good and interesting points. I believe the disconnect here is in the idea that every one needs some type of instruction and training. Whatever you call the avenue, it is an institution of learning. 




 Let me get this straight: you think that somehow hiring someone with a Masters degree in computer science and paying for an h1b visa etc just to have them work for you is cheaper than hiring an American with equal qualifications. 
Also, when the owner of said company tells you that there is a shortage, it is nothing but obdurate obstinacy to insist that 'it', the shortage, is a myth. Where do you find your data to back up your claims that there is sufficient supply? Why do you think so many foreigners are lining up to go to school here if there isn't an abundance of demand or shortage of supply of those with their respective degrees?
But don't let any of what I say stop you from holding dearly to your opinion, after all, this is a free country... Right? 




 I find this disturbing. It 'sounds' funny' and 'amusing' but you may be in serious need of help. This sounds like a very toxic psychic state to be in. You should be blissful about the opportunity to continue your activities on this new day. 




 You're right, you are beneath his level. 




 My point exactly. Let's keep ignoring the 100s of thousands of educated people who built and maintain Microsoft. If which many had to be imported from India and China because people like this don't see a need to educate Americans.
So sad. 




 That's the problem with your reasoning. It is assuming that the gifted ones come from a background of privilege.
Do you see the demographics in graduate school? Hmm? You are looking at life from a1950s lens. You can not do anything in this world without at least a college education. And even if you did, you would need a week educated labor force to execute. The 'labor' you speak of, that is, the skilled manufacturing and similar work from the 50s are the programmers and engineers of today. 
Please stop this idea that education is not necessary. Why do you want to keep importing education from abroad and allowing your own people to wake away? 




 "...You'll learn things you never knew you never knew.." 




 This is one of the very reasons to which a government owes it's very existence. 




 Even if we didn't have the supervision problem. Uneducated people create a third world country. They also don't do things like build internet, smartphones, or Reddit...
I should know, I'm from one! 




 I was simply trying to map your words on data and experience and the brain to what we know about computers. 




 Have you tried mapping this idea to an actual computer? How does that framework hold up? Do the same conclusions hold? 




 Sounds like you have "all" the answers you need. 

Edit: your strong dissention is duly noted 




 It would solve nothing. Nothing will ever convince anyone of anything they do not already believe or not believe. 
Such evidence will be dismissed and the investigators' reputation called into question.

One likely scenario is scientists misunderstanding what they have found and forming a new religion and this new religion will promptly being rejected by all existing ones. And so the chain continues...
 




 Your cells are replaced daily. I think on average you are entirely 'replaced' every 1.5 years or so. I forget what the math is. 




 Think about having two bio-suits.
Actually, even simpler, think about your clothes. How many do you have? More than two, right? What exactly is going on with your other clothes when 'you' are not wearing them? They are simply lifeless no?
'You' give life to 'your' body. Without 'you', 'your' body is lifeless. It is dead. So perhaps having another suit made will simply result in it being in some kind of vegetative state or just cold and without life. Unless you can figure out a way to plug yourself into it, like changing clothes, then it is impossible to move from one body to another.
I think of this in a similar way to how it is when you sleep....
Actually, this may be the best way to explain it. Perhaps the one body will simply fall into a deep coma/sleep-like state while you occupy another. 
But really, i don't think this idea is possible. It is much more plausible to think of some way to propagate the body from one location to another. Perhaps we should focus on transporting a piece of stone first? 




 Then use it as a working hypothesis.
There are things constituent of matter, which we know 'hypothetically' to exist but are yet unable to measure, or detect simply because we do not have the instrument powerful enough to measure these things.
On a much more fundamental level, if something was not made up of matter, but something else. Some other substance, call it ethereal or typeB. We know from physics that it will be impossible to have any direct measurement or 'evidence' of said substance using material instruments or tools. You need the right tool fashioned for the right purpose. Otherwise it will be like trying to detect x-rays with a radio or water with a net.... 




 It's about moderation (in the absolute sense not after you have altered your taste buds). You can train yourself to be just as satisfied with less salt if you take the time to tapper down. Your tongue will become more sensitive and require less salt to get the same sensation. Just in the same way with sugar and all else.
 




 This is the problem with the idea that what is the real you is physical. This body along with the brain is just a bio-machine, wet-ware. Like an exoskeleton used by the actual you for an earth-life. You are plugged in during pregnancy, and disconnect once it is destroyed or no longer functional due to irreparable damage or wear and tear from aging.
It's really not so difficult to accept this is it? 




 100% efficiency solar cells.
Some integer-fraction-speed-of-light-travel transport device.
And, wait for it, quantum learning pod (ala Vulcan learning pod).

 I think you should be more worried about the salt/sodium additives in preserved food than actual table salt. 




 Is any body correcting for increase in movie ticket prices or inflation? 




 So, let me put it this way:
Reading any of what you've quoted, 'holy' or 'good' is about the last thing that can ever be likened to it. It reads more like gruesome, noisome, disgust, or vermin.
Nothing of what is written in any of these books even sounds holy or good. And we all know who the usual suspects are when things are turned on their head and start to stink: man. This sounds very much like man's idea not something 'good' or 'holy' 




 Is the "beast" the government, corporations or is it simply you and I as a depraved collective unit? Government - I don't have any brilliant ideas except collective action. Similar to what the 'patriots' in days of yore did.
Corporations - avoid products and services directly and indirectly. Again this requires collective action.

And so the only logical conclusion here is that all of these point back to us as a collective unit being the proverbial beast. 

This is me just thinking out loud... 




 Clearly. 




 Congress 14.0 beta. I wonder what new features come with it... 




 Or put your money where your mouth is and stop feeding the beast. Each day we read about corporate practices we don't like and still consume, directly or indirectly, and invest in the these same corporations. Why? 




 From such a small sample, you can't call it a study.. 




 Not if my upvote on your comment about upvoting it has anything to say about anything your comment has to say about it! 




 Sounds wonderful. I rejoice with you friend. Now, don't mess it up :) 




 Wow. Such a thing is very transient. Meaning she will outgrow such childish behavior sooner rather than later. If she was as great as you say, is have slowly helped her see how stupid her behavior was, and help her fix it. 




 Maybe we should ask the hormonal police officer that question.... 




 Yeah, there's a video of what actually happened and the woman in question was yelling racial profanity and instigated a verbal and physical assault. The age of one sided lies are over, we have video proof now. 




 I wish more of us would see life this way. What is the point of a life if it isn't to the service of others? What really is the point? Fleeting, trivialities that amount to nothing.
