 Are you being sarcastic?  




 Seriously?  
























 I just can't find a real compass! 









 Ones that can work on mobile devices too. 









   I heard border collies really go crazy if you don't give them something to do. I'm worried my pooch gets bored when I'm not home. Border collies are dogs bread for work. They love work, even if it's a simple task. So what activities or "jobs" could my Border collie do? 




 I asked r/ vfx, but I want an answer from a larger community. 




 I don't understand the pricing system. I pay 495 upfront, then what? 
(I plan on buying the commercial version.) 









   Greetings Reddit, I think I'm done. 
I can't take it anymore! I have no one to talk to!
  I'm such a loser, one of my teachers has a strong disliking towards me, I live in my cousin's shadow, and my dad was never there for me...
  One day at school, I had had it. I was gonna do it. I tried to tell myself that I was being irrational. 
  I went to the counselor. They called my mom. Rather than being supportive or consoling, she got onto me for telling the school, saying that they're going to label me.
  I wanted to talk to my dad, but he is overseas. He doesn't give enough of a care.
  I have no one to talk to. I'm a popular guy, and have many friends, too many to count, but yet, I have no one to talk to! 
  My parents and my friends are only concerned for themselves. It's always them, not me...
  I can't tell you how many times I've been cheated out of birthday celebrations, or have never been called by my dad. 
  I can't do it Reddit!  




 How would this abandon all of that? 




   I've been on minecraft since Alpha. I loved it. I grew with it. I was 10 at the time of classic. Oh the fun! 
  Everyone hates the updates, and so did I for a while. But I'm starting to like them. I think horses and the armor stands give minecraft a medieval feel. 
  What is your stance on the updates? 




   We need them. C.nerd.nu is stuck in the olden days without them. With slimeblocks, we can create flying machines. We can venture into the skies of minecraft, we can safely venture into the void. This is the final frontier... 




   I feel like the community is dieing. I don't want Minecraft to end. Minecraft is a beacon of hope in the hell that is the gaming world, it is a fresh page that stands out against the all the "GUNZ BLAZIN COD FPS". 
  Minecraft doesn't feel fun anymore. It feels like it's dragging with all the recent updates. What do we do? I don't want minecraft to die! 









 Oh my god op... Give us the seed or instructions how to generate a world like that! 




   Tell us about the greatest things that have ever happened on vanilla servers. For me it was this battle we had against a guy who created this army of mobs. He built a fortress literally IN the layers of the farlands. This was beta of course.
  Tell us your vanilla nostalgia stories and feel free to list the ip to a vanilla server in the comments: 









 Thank you for the advice! 




   Hello my good comrades. I'm 14 and am interested in that of a filmmaking career. I want to create top-notch effects, to do this, I feel the only professional tools for me would be The Foundry's Nuke. The thing is, this costs $4000. I've had this dream of becoming a filmmaker for a long, long time, since I was a wee lad! 
  My parents won't allow me to work a real or summer job just yet, so what might I do until then?  




   I'm about to be 14, and would like to have a career as a filmmaker. I want my cgi to be top-notch. I want it to be so good, it gets featured on the Cgbros YouTube page. So, I would like to aquire a copy of The Foundry's Nuke. The thing is, this software costs about $4000. My parents won't let me get a job yet, so I've turned to r/beermoney. Being an avid user of the subreddit, I saw how someone went to Vegas on their "beermoney", so if they can go to Vegas, I can get Nuke, how hard can it be? Harder than you think my friends...Vindale looked very attractive, but my hopes were dashed when I found it charges you for the products you test. I turned to swagbucks, which promised $35 per survey, but my hopes were crushed yet again when I realized these offers are only to reel you in, after that you get a survey every two months for only $0.02.
  I need advice. What might I do? 




   I want to start a career as a filmmaker, to accomplish this, I'm going to need to get a copy of The Foundry's Nuke. This vfx and compositing software is used in every film from Gravity, to Star Trek, to Transformers, you name it, Nuke is in it!
The thing is, this software costs about $4000. My parents don't really want me working a job yet, so what might I do?
  Being an avid user of r/beermoney, I've always wanted to try a bunch of paid surveys, and maybe in 1-2 years I could get the money, but I'm afraid of scams, so I really need some advice! 














 Did it get taken down? It was from 2010 or 11. 




 I downloaded an app called badoo, put my profile as a member of isis, messed with people, someone legitametely called the police. I am in Texas. 



















   It's turning into an rpg. 




   He played Saruman. He could be a great Herobrine.

 Also, does the student version give you watermarks and only let you render in less than HD? 














   Say I torrent a music creating software and publish my works and make money off said works, is that illegal? 














 Saw this on /3DCG/. The question was, "If I used a pirate bay torrent to download The Foundry's Nuke (A vfx Software) and use it to create little short films like FreddieW on YouTube, would it be illegal if I used Google Ads and made money off of the videos I created with the software I downloaded with a torrent?"
 









 I see places where you can find after effects, MODO, Cinema 4d and all those goodies for sometimes half-price, but are there any good places where you can find a copy of The Foundry's Nuke for $2500-1000 at least?
