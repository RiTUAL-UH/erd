 Based on your "corporations are people" and "taxing the church" comment; I think you've got a bit of learning to do yourself before you start lashing out at other people. 




 I'm confused now. What else do German men wear? 




 Let's not forget second best rebounder. 




 Kevin Love *killed* amare and dirk last season, 




 Just enter two line-breaks instead of one to create a new line :) 




 1. **Annie Hall - Woody Allen - 1977**: The greatest comedy ever made, was masterfully composed by its nonlinear storytelling, and the disappointing and undramatic ending hit harder because it made the movie feel so much more grounded in reality despite its hyper-exaggerated quirkiness. Also, just plain goddamn hilarious.

2. **The Godfather parts I and II - Francis Ford Coppola - 1972, 74**: The greatest story ever told in American cinema. While the writing, acting, cinematography, are all near-perfect; the biggest mark is the elegance with which Michael Corleon's transformation is shown. No mafia film since has gone by without avoiding the shadow of this movie's legacy.

3. **North By Northwest - Hitchcock - 1959**: it feels like it was the precursor to the Bond films, but with Hitchcock quality direction. It is the both the essential action movie, and the essential mistaken identity movie.

4. **Barry Lyndon - Kubrick - 1975**: Almost every single scene takes on an otherworldly characteristic with the incredibly beautiful shots of the European countryside. 

5. **Once Upon A Time In The West - Sergio Leone - 1968**: This was the ultimate spaghetti western director at the height of his power. In my (unpopular) opinion, it has both a superior soundtrack and a more mature story than The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.

6. **There Will Be Blood - P.T. Anderson - 2007**: a performance for the ages by DDL, masterful direction by Anderson, ripe with symbolism and analytically dense. It's a modern day wet dream for movie lovers.

7. **2001: A Space Odyssey - Kubrick - 1968**: I could talk about this movie for hours. It has so many thematic layers hidden behind an extraordinary depiction of space and a brilliantly anthropomorphized robot antagonist. 

8. **Apocalypse Now - Coppola - 1979**: One of the most deep and fascinating explorations of human psychology through the medium of a war, conveyed through an Odyssey-esque journey.

9. **Lawrence Of Arabia - David Lean - 1962**: This is the definitive hollywood epic. The grandiosity is complemented by such a stark contrast in the humane and relatable personal struggle. This is what a 'blockbuster' should be.

10. **Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? - Mike Nichols - 1966**: there's something sharp and gripping and poignant about the dialogue in this movie. It rips into your soul and surfaces again for air over and over again for 2 hours.

And I really, really, really wanted to put Fargo, Manhattan, It happened one night, and the LOTR trilogy. Ten just isn't enough :( 




 Fuck my life. 

Even if Orlando was going for full on tank-and-rebuild; we could have and should have done a hell of a lot better than Mo Harkless as our young talent acquisition; and we should have found a way to acquire better draft picks than 2017-lottery-protected first rounders. Orlando unequivocally loses huge, no matter which way you look at it. 

Our lineup going into this season looks something like Jameer-Affalo/Redick-Hedo-Big Baby-Gustavo Ayon; with Vucavic, Harkless, Nicholson, and whatever point guard we sign coming off the bench. It's going to be a depressing stretch of 18-28 win seasons for the magic going forward. 




 You are everything that's wrong with America. 




 I'm actually mad at the absurd lack of young talent we're getting for dwight. I really wanted the Rockets to be involved in this trade :/ 




 ...That's not really how cancer works though. 




 Ha ha. You are so inflammatory and masterful with your trolling. It must feel really great. 




 Kareem would like a word with your word with johnydoom. 




 Holy hell. Australia played them tough as nails for 34 minutes and then **BAM!** 




 Is there a box score of this game somewhere that doesn't suck like NBC's? 




 Some very dubious calls going in America's favor -_- 




 I guess the olympic spirit got the best of him. 




 If we're not at our best, it's going to be even worse for you guys when you lose to us :p 




 Greg Reid, now this... *COME ON*

I have this heartbreaking feeling we're going to anomalously be ravaged by injuries/off the field issues for the second season in a row, finish something like 10-3, be ranked in the high-teens, and considered a huge disappointment again.




Okay. So that's probably a bit panicky. I'm just ready for the season to start.  




 I just thought it was a funny general example, because Florida might be the most apocalyptic legal market in the nation right now. 11 law schools + none of them having much/any interstate reach = *nobody* who goes to law school in Florida is reasonable safe the way a lot of "good regional placement" state schools are. 




 You haven't seen Florida's employment stats I'm guessing. The best way to get a job in Florida is to go to a really high ranked school and have contacts and connections in Florida. 




 And be honest. 




 Wait. Which continent are you talking about? 




 Loving the troll flair. 




 That article was awful. 




 It seems like the genuine coolness of the TED empire started declining almost completely in sync with its widespread growth in popularity. It's sad to see TEDx talks that are sometimes legitimately awful; and it's now even more sad to see, as the author put it 'that TED is no longer a responsible curator of ideas worth spreading."' 




 Tax. Not even a competition. 




 Some combination of 

1. Something you're interested in doing, given the very high likelihood of deciding not to go to law school

2. Something that will allow you to maintain the highest gpa possible. Think 3.9-4.0

Depending on your interests, you might be forced to pick one of the two. But if you want to go to law school, having an absurdly high GPA is *enormously* helpful. 

 




 Nope. There's only one way in which "tiers" is used when talking about a law school, and that's in reference to its national ranking. And John Marshall is a tier-4, for what it's worth. 




 tl;dr- if people *tried* harder to get jobs, then more jobs will magically appear. 




 Let A connote "eating a butterfinger" and B represent "you are thirsty." the first part of the statement is simplified to "if A, then B" and the only other logical statement we can create from that is the contrapositive "If not B, then not A" which would expand to "If you are not thirsty, then you did not eat a butterfinger."

So your friend's statement rephased: "if B, then A" does not logically follow from "If A, then B"; is sound logic and he should be congratulated. 




 "Hitherto there has been no thought I have been afraid of; if I should run across such a thought, I hope that I have at least the sincerity to say, 'I am afraid of this thought, it stirs up something else in me, and therefore I will not think it.' If in this I do wrong, the punishment will not fail to follow." 

(Kierkegaard)
 




 Wait.... really? 




 Why are there SO MANY FOULS this game?? 




 The Nigerian defense was so painfully bad... they would have had to start rigging their own shots to miss if they had wanted their fg% to drop below 50%. 




 This title/message is so confusing. WHICH ONE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO RESPOND TO? 




 Some of my favorites right now: Barry Lyndon, Lawrence of Arabia, Once Upon A Time In The West, North by Northwest, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Apocalypse Now. 

I know what you mean about just doing it to check items off a list, I definitely think there are a handful of films I just watched and moved on from, and are probably already due for a rewatching. But I think having that list there was the best way to just start plunging into cinema from scratch. 









 Aw man, I love the Yuffie sidequest. 




 that scene bugged me, because every time his ex did something to get hotter her hotness axis didn't increase, her crazy axis decreased. 




 At first I thought the author was just saying "you should find more tactful and creative ways of saying these things." But some of his commentary is just really poor and wrong (see: 2, 7). For 4 and 5 he's just contradicting himself by saying that you *should* say them, but don't do it right away. Well, duh.  




 I can understand that. But I think the point is for the rest of the congregation to know to reach out to them. I was visiting a church that did this; and several people came up to talk to me and help get acquainted. It was nice. 




  If he had any decent offensive threats at the 4 and 5

You say that like Carlos Boozer isn't a decent offensive threat? I mean, I understand why the Bulls hate him; but the demonizing is kindof hilarious sometimes. 




 **That's even worse** 




 He's come even farther since Angels in the Outfield. 




 Ew. 




 I've worked there. They don't.  




 If it's any consolation, I hate you on the inside as well. 




 Meh; I think that there are too many good power forwards in the west: Love, Dirk, Aldridge, the manimal, Blake Griffin, Demarcus Cousins, Pau.

Combined with the fact that Anderson went from being the Magic's second scoring option to now having to share the ball with The Brow, Austin Rivers, Eric Gordon, and company. I'd be legitimately shocked if Anderson makes an all-star team while in NO. 




 Eh. Most lists I've ever seen have Kareem above Bird. 




  Just try "hey, how are you" then. Ladies are often interested in the mysterious.

This is actually a terrible idea. Women almost never reply to thoughtless messages, because most of the time they just assume the guy is mass messaging, or under the rationale of "he didn't put in any time for me, so why should I for him?"

The key is to keep it a couple sentences long, ask conversation-starting questions about things she put on her profile, and don't sound stupid. 




 It also gives you a LOT less leeway if you're trying to differentiate between an A- (which is usually 90-92) and A (which is 93+). 




 RYAN ANDERSON COME ON PEOPLE. 




 Ryan Anderson has a much bright future already than Gallinari. 




 At least we still have ~~A great young PF in Ryan Anderson~~  
~~And awesome head coach~~  
~~A ton of cap space to work with~~  
~~Daniel Orton coming along nicely~~  
Hedo Turkoglu! 




 I'm actually pretty positive it was meant in jest, and people upvoting origibanality didn't quite get that, or are willfully ignoring it. 




 Lost in a world of condescending intellectualism through middle school, aficionado of the inner workings of their thought processes by 16. My guess is that now he's about to start his freshman year of college, and spent the summer rigorously outlining his magnum opus "the psychology of man." 




 *redoubles stalking efforts*
 




 Eh, that's not universal. I know a good handful of guys who ended up dating (and subsequently marrying) girls they were good friends with first. 




 Ummm no. The revenue of single stores can come close to 4 million dollars a year. That second number is completely wrong. 




 If by "large portion" you mean like .001% 




 Correct, it's served on a lightly toasted and lightly buttered hamburger bun with pickles. 




 But why make a list of something; and then put a player on that list for criteria completely unrelated to that list?

Not to mention, it's not even a safe assumption. To project he's going to have a better career than someone like Isiah Thomas or Allen Iverson is just *far* from being very likely. 




 How can someone realize that Malone was a 2x MVP, one of which was over '97 Michael Jordan? Not to mention he's second all-time behind Kareem in career points, enjoying one of the longest stretches of quality play *ever*, and still ranking him behind Kevin McHale?

We're talking an 11 time all-nba first teamer vs. 0 time all-nba any teamer.

This is frustrating. 




 This is a list that already has Kevin Durant at #25. I'm not putting much stock into it. 




 Why would your order a spicey chicken sandwich at the original one? They have HAMBURGERS AND FRIED OKRA there. 




 Chick fila's are very likely the most profitable franchises of all fast food in the southeast. A "decent" franchise can see 11k-12k in revenue on a good day. Choosing to franchise a chick fila could have very well been a financial decision, and there was probably no reason to expect boycotts in the near future. 




 Replace dinner table with middle school cafeteria.  




 I don't see too much of a problem with the military acting on a policy of "would be beneficial" rather than "need." Especially since the state of modern warfare is almost completely preventative.  




 No. But Chopin was bad ass. 




 We both share a birthday with Chopin and Justin Bieber. Yeah! 




 TIL I am dyslexic.  




 I feel bad for not knowing if you're being serious. Like maybe there's some paid bible study service somewhere that I've never heard of or something. 




 Rest assured, I am very afraid of how hard you are going to take it on me. 




 Building muscle in conjunction with some cardio, what football players do, is probably more healthy than distance running is. 




 Yep. Also, as a distance runner, the injury stockpile can be incredibly high (in the same realm as football) as well.  




 Yep, also football is so incredibly king in America, I don't think it'll come close to losing that status in the next 40-50 years. 




 wouldn't those be the same option though? 




 Yep. the word "kobe" on a menu means literally nothing about the meat. 




 I think he'll be a fantasy basketball steal this year. 




 Iwasjoking. 




 that's more statisticsy than sciencey; and you don't fuck with statistical validity. 




 Ugh, this subreddit is kindof a mess. 




 No way. Malone was absolutely better than Barkley. They had comparably good peaks, and Malone's absurd longevity gives him a huge edge. 




 Yep, Dwight is still significantly better offensively. 




 Better players =/= bigger roles *or* better stats. 




 I feel like citing to PER will get you mass-downvoted in r/nba. Especially if you mention rondo is ranked 21st among point guards in PER. 




 Make it 7' and I'm in. 




 Nah, most people could get a solid understanding of the relevant (to them) tax code by reading an hour a day for 2-3 months.

It's not like the only way to learn it is to read the freaking code itself either, there are supplements that break it down quite nicely for you. 




 Except recognition on investment income is, in most cases, easily deferred, so your second to last paragraph is pragmatically moot. 




 FWIW, accountants, lawyers, and bankers can all go up to 85-90 hours a week in the "big-4, biglaw, BBB" arena (not often, but not uncommon). 

Lawyers in that field *start* at 160k out of law school in big markets (NYC, DC, some Chicago firms), accountants start 60-90k but have a turtle climb to a much much higher ceiling. I don't know what the starting salary is for big-market banking, but they have by far the highest ceiling of all.  




 This is actually false! For tax purposes your income is only reduced by the amount that interest accrues on those loans. So technically you're making about -850ish a year. 




 teenage parenthood.  




 I've taken about 30 LSAT exams, and I can only remember that being the case once or twice. 




 That's nonsensical though. If you do something, you're still by definition trying to do it first, regardless of your level of confidence. 

When someone says "I'm not going to be able to pick up that rock," "I'll try to pick up that rock," and "I'm going to pick up that rock," they're still going to try to pick up that rock in all three scenarios. The middle one is just a neutral statement of fact without a predictive assertion.  




 You can have R v Dudley and Stephens... Enjoy it. 




 If you be the awesome SO I will definitely marry you.

Note: I will be a *slightly-above-average* SO. 




 Ugh. 




 IIRC there were eyewitness reports of the other team feeding him the ball at the end of the game to get to 100. 




 1. Yeah... that really diminished the coolness, knowing off the top of my head that one of these was definitively wrong.

2. 3 personal jurisdiction. 




 2. Can you cite a source then? Do you see how the second sentence doesn't logically validate the first?

5. If you're making an argument against the death penalty, it seems fair to have complaints that are narrowly tailored against the death penalty; and not broad problems with the entire justice system.

7. Spread out across the nation? That's really not much at all, and that amount would likely be doing nothing right now other than easing municipal and state budget crises to a very small degree. 

-still upvoted you though because discussion is good. 




 Magic had already been retired for a full year when he was on the Dream Team. Bird's back was going out and he was a year away from retiring as well. Either way, that shouldn't shock you for rebounds because  Charles Barkley was a considerably better rebounder than any of the three, which makes sense because he was a power forward and they were a shooting guard, point guard, and small forward respectively. 

Points/steals is still legitimately surprising, but not entirely when you consider that all-star teams tend to lead to historically wonky results; especially with such a high random chance of variation (from such a small set of games). Take for instance the [box score](http://www.usabasketball.com/misc/12_mnt_exh_05_box.pdf) of the latest game between USA and Spain. Carmelo led the team in points despite the fact that he was 6th in the league in [points-per-game](http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/scoring-per-game/sort/avgPoints/year/2012/seasontype/2) and all five players in front of him were also on the roster.  




 Your second point doesn't logically follow- It's very possible that it is a deterrent, and is preventing an even *higher* rate of murder. States could 

Your fifth point seems moot because that's true for minorities across just about all non-white collar crimes. So it will only naturally extend.

Your seventh point is just kind of silly because the number of executions multiplied by the difference in cost between a life sentence and a death penalty is negligible compared to just about any program that could create real societal change.  




 I think as a big man being drafted #1 overall, you're kindof inherently expected to be a good rebounder and at least a decent defender. 




 ehhhhh. I think you'd be stupid to say he doesn't even have an argument for top-10 all time, but I don't think he's "easily" top-10. For instance, you could very well make a convincing (or at least, a respectable) argument that 1. Jordan 2. Kareem 3. Wilt 4. Russell 5. Magic 6. Bird 7. Shaq 8. Tim Duncan 9. Oscar Robinson 10. Hakeem 11. Lebron James 12. Karl Malone are better than him on the all time list right now.

I do think he's a top-10 all time player, but you can't deny there's a certain subjectivity to it; and Kobe could definitely be excluded from that top 10 amongst the wiggle room. I could see him being anywhere from 7th to 13th. 




 Not as much, but that statistic about Bowden is wrong as presented. 




 Only in division 1 though. 




 Does that really count as an infographic?
