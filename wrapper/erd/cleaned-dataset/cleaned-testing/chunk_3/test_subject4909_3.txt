 I can understand the Teamsters, but I'm not too familiar with the situation in the Ironworkers and Pipefitters. What do you think were the points in dispute ? Were there actually meetings or was the whole matter handled by email without any member input ? There are a lot of questions here. 




 Yes, I've always found 'The Conversation' to be interesting, informative and well written. It's well worth following. 




 I think you're right. The part that gets me in the quote you post is the "outside of nature" part. 




 It can be useful, and I'd encourage it. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the centers are usually funded by other unions and community groups. It would vary on a case by case basis as to how much 'gymnastics' have to be done to stay on their good side. 




 Yes, SPF ??. 




 I think that's probably a good suggestion. Of course I'm only the reposter, but maybe you should write the Pew Center about it. I don't know if they can easily edit their article or not, but it's worth a shot. 




 I get a chuckle out of such typos as well. I wonder if it was the human or the computer that made the mistake. 




 I wish you well. One thing that puzzles me... in your second paragraph you seem to be saying that your latest episode was less severe "because of facebook" Am I reading you right ? If I am correct about this it gets me thinking about the "how" of such a thing. Continual useful feedback perhaps ? 




 Thank you. This is a valuable contribution to the debate. 




 Well perhaps, but consider the most massive and rapid 'language spread' in human history. Language expansion such as English, Portuguese and French in the New World were obviously correlated with a gigantic 'gene flow'. The case of Spanish varies from country to country, but its presence in countries such as Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and the whole of the Hispanic Caribbean is also an example of gene flow/language change. In the case of the Caribbean there was a 100% replacement of the genes of previous occupants who spoke languages other than Spanish, English, French and Dutch. 

So...language change doesn't *always* correlate with gene flow, but in some cases the 'gene flow', often an euphemism for genocide, is the sole only explanation. It all depends on the situation. 




 That's the implication. 




 It puzzles me as well. The difference is so wide that I'm at a loss to explain it by factors such as smoking, obesity, etc.. On the other hand what innate sexual factor could cause such a disparity in this one type of cancer but not in others ? There's room for a lot of speculation here. 




 When you repost something from another subreddit it is considered courteous to mention that it is a repost. This was originally posted at r/worldanarchism. 




 Sorry, my error. 




 Yep, that's the item. I believe that it was first described in Naples which had extensive trading relations with Barcelona (under the Spanish Crown) at the time. From there it spread via the trade routes like the bubonic plague did in the 14th century from Genoa. Columbus' expedition sailed from Seville, but that city was something of an 'outport' compared to Barcelona. I believe it was where routes north to Barcelona, west to the Atlantic and east to North Africa branched. 




 There is a parallel for sure. 




 The general consensus is that syphilis came from the New World. The alternative hypothesis is that it developed from the tropical disease 'Yaws'. The first theory is the most accepted one. As for the Chinese they were in at least indirect contact with Europe for a long time before the 15th century. The Black Death, after all, did originate on the Mongolian steppes. 




 Yes, telling the future from innards is sometimes hard to *stomach*. 




 My first guess would be changes in diet, but why would that have more of an effect on males ? Estrogen mimics should theoretically cause an increase in a large number of different cancers. It's a puzzle to me.  




 Don't both sides already know who wins ? 




 Competition to tea leave fortune-telling I guess. 




 This is a pretty common response of municipal authorities whenever a big event, usually a sporting one, takes place in a city. The sweep, of course, can't by its very nature reduce the overall number of street people by one single person. It merely displaces the 'problem' to another location.  




 My mistake. It's been corrected. My keyboard sometimes misses the "w"s, and it did in this case in the **W**ikipedia part of the link. 




 I don't think so. As I read the article it seems to be promoting some sort of updated philosophical idealism in that the only reality is that created in the observer's mind. I disagree with this point of view, but when discussing it we leave the realm of physics and enter metaphysics. 




 There is a [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea_Ultima) that has links to various pictorial representations of speculations about future continents. 




 No problem. What's "SMH" ? 




 Just to clear up your misconception. I have **never** invited a single person to become a moderator at any time whatsoever. You can verify this by looking through the modmail. 




 This seems very much like any other time bank. What would you say makes a difference here ? 




 Le Guin is one of a very few sci-fi/fantasy writers who are open about their anarchist beliefs. Michael Moorcock is another. I'm sure others could add to this list. 




 I like the fact that the building they have repurposed used to be a prison, one that was used for many years by the Franco regime nonetheless.  




 Possible target for cancer therapy I'd presume. 




 Glad to see it. I wish you well. 




 Very interesting, and I hope to comment further. In any case thanks for reminding me about the digitalization project at the IISH. I read about it awhile ago, but it slipped my memory. Gotta have another look at that. 




 The problem is that the legal status of corporations usually shields the management from legal action. That being said there *have* been examples of individual executives and managers being sued. It's a complicated point of law. I do agree with your statement that the individuals should be charged. It's just that I am uncertain if they *can* be. 




 Good question. I've seen some reconstruction of dinosaur sounds, both terrestrial and aquatic, from studies of their nasal passages, but none that have been very specific. 




 Let's call it an example of 'The Joy of Title Cooking'. When presenting research news to the general public the whole culture of journalism and its markets pushes people towards the 'grabby' title. I read your link to NPR, and after you got past the title it wasn't that bad.  




 Yes, that's possible, but the nature of chaotic motion is such that nobody could predict it. Unless some craft was observing at the time probably all that we would see is 'moons at time zero' and 'no moons (or one) at time zero plus x'.  




 No, but you could at least invite him out for a few beers. 




 That's true isn't it. I can't cite chapter and verse, but I do recall that this sort of thing has been mentioned in terms of the possibility of life in multi-star systems. The multi-body problem strikes again. 




 Yes it was meant for you, even though you weren't the first accuser. If you weren't merely trying to clarify the original accusation then claiming that "they do not apply their supposed values to their on lives" is more than an allusion to purity. It is a direct implication/statement that the person who wants the amplifiers isn't "pure" because he wants said consumer good. If you say he is "hypocritical" you are applying a standard of judgement that judges his "purity" in relation to either his views, the views you think he holds or perhaps the views you *think* he should hold.

I don't know how many thousands (perhaps tens of thousands) of times I have heard similar accusations of hypocrisy/impurity leveled by leftists over the decades. Sometimes it sticks to the target. Usually it doesn't. It hardly ever sticks in the case of consumer goods. The *only* way it could be properly defined as hypocrisy would be if the target *consistently* demanded some renunciation of consumer goods from others. In such a case he would be "hypocritical" because he was impure himself.

In actuality it makes no difference whatsoever to the wider world if the target gets his amplifiers or not. His act of 'impurity/immorality' has no demonstrable physical consequence. If he doesn't buy the amplifiers someone else will. End of story. The only standard of judgement is about his personal character/purity. *That* is judgement of his purity or lack thereof. If he was doing something that had a real physical effect, such as being a boss then the accusation would have had a base in reality.

Once more, if you were merely explaining the original accusation I stand corrected. If you were supporting it then see above... 




 I think you have a point in that. 




 Well, if you wish to get into arguments about purity I've got a good analogy. The Jain religion takes 'non-harm' to its ultimate point. If you wish to be a *truly* pure Jain you end up starving yourself to death out of a reluctance to do any harm to any other living being. People can't live on salt alone. Out of millions of Jains at any one time there are only a few dozen going this route in India. It's basically unheard of in the diaspora. The greatest and most obvious reason why Jainism still exists is simply that at all times and places 99.9999% of the population will *always* choose to be 'impure'. Seems to me they make the sensible choice. 




 Yes. I perhaps date myself by saying that the electronic format is annoying enough to me that I *never* read a book that way - only in print. I'll read articles on the internet but not a book. 




 I believe that the efforts to make $15/hour the minimum apply to all low wage workers. It's just that people working in fast food make up such a large proportion of such people. 




 Yes, failure of the monsoons is amongst the possibilities of climate change, and its effects would be even more disastrous. To my knowledge climate change also had a big role in human evolution at the western end of the Indian Ocean. 




 Thanks for the info. 




 No doubt the writers take information through a 'supply chain' that begins with the military and their contractors and is thus 'optimistic'. I'm afraid I can't comment on the possibility you raise, but it is a caution worthy of mention. 




 That's true. It's like 'loading the dice' or 'fixing the wheel' in gambling.  




 If it did it would have been a great thing to do DNA analysis on. 




 Not really. It's long been a matter of dispute. 




 Fimbrae and adhesins are basically the same thing ie structures that bind the prokaryotic cell to surfaces such as an eukaryotic cell. The difference between the classical view of binding via fimbrae and the results described in the original paper is that the authors have uncovered a mechanism that leads to much firmer binding via a covalent bond to proteins on the cell surface. This is via thioester moieties. 

You can find the [original paper](http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e06638) at the online journal Elife, and the full explanation is there. 




 In order for a place name to be transmitted to newcomers there would have to be people on hand to tell the new people the name. I wonder if there is any documentary evidence of the Vikings finding people already there when they landed in Iceland. There is certainly writings about aboriginal people in regards to both Greenland Vinland.  




 Rent control is a local or state matter, not a national one. The other thing is that there is not a single example of rent *reduction* via such laws/regulation. They only slow down the rate of increase. 




 Given what I read of the early history the people who first formed PS had been active before Occupy, perhaps for years. Perhaps Occupy galvanized them by both a sense of possibility but also a demonstration of the failure of political movements that lack a program and a structure. 




 I don't know if it that apathetic. It probably depends on what community you live in. The prairies, however, were once one of the 'hot spots' of radicalism in Canada, but yes, it has been declining for decades. 




 I assume that they are taking this from the idea that subcutaneous fat was needed for insulation in the water. The 'aquatic ape' hypothesis has few followers today. If you think this is bad have a look at some of the other comments. 




 Yes that would be better. I used the original title from Nature. In the context of this paper the authors are using primary production - the total biomass produced - as an estimate for the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. The problem on reddit is that you can only edit text posts and comments, not titles. Otherwise I'd go with your suggestion. 




 Well, I suppose we could have a long conversation about doing something that is not only possible but actually being done as we speak, instead of living in resentment and doing nothing. We could also have a conversation about the pluses and minuses of 'worker1vote', and how I personally don't consider it the best model. *However* before any such thing I have to ask a question.......

*How on Earth do you think that a link to the **Freelancers' Union** and its Board of Directors where one of the Directors has a connection to Goldman Sachs has **anything whatsoever** to do with the pluses or minuses of a totally different organization ie the one in the article* ? ??? One can make many criticisms of both the USW and Mondragon, but dragging in a totally different union is not amongst the arguments. 




 Thanks. I found my mistake. The last numbers in the address are '34435' not '3445'. Sherlock Holmes and the case of the missing '4'. 




 There is a more detailed [article](http://www.alasbarricadas.org/noticias/node/3435) in Spanish at the site of the Spanish anarchist magazine A Las Barricadas. 




 Here's a few. I'll hopefully be adding others later.

 The trouble with the actions is that they aren't merely restricted to this particular company. There is a lot of other 'greenwashing' that happens. No doubt Norwegians should demand investment in renewable energy - which will probably be mostly hydro given the nature of the country, perhaps wind. The oil won't last forever. 




 Yes, "strive in vain" is a better translation. I've changed it in the body of the post. Thanks. I was puzzled by that last line. 




 I wish the Black Rose Federation well, but I am very doubtful about their success. Hopefully I am wrong. North America is a particularly 'unhealthy' environment for such an organization given the prominence of other 'points of view' amongst anarchists there. I was never a member, but I can remember saying back in 1980 exactly the same thing you say now; "it isn't time yet".  There have been other efforts since then, all of them eventually transient. NEFAC as a good effort, but it had its failings. Prior to that 'Love and Rage' went some distance, but its internal politics were basically - horrifying. I can remember reading the first edition of their paper, and the thought came into my mind; "What is this Maoist bullshit"; best I keep my distance from this crew." Of course not all of their efforts were Maoist influenced, but you simply can't have Maoists and sane people in the same organization.

Outside of the USA I'm fairly confident that there are no other Anglophone countries with the 'partial' exceptions of Ireland and the UK that are 'ready' in any sense. I think that the situation is different in other countries, but I might be wrong on this. It's easy to get a blurred picture from afar. 




 To speak to the question rather than other comments:

As time goes by in the 'anarcho-waiting room' if you have an open and critical mind you find yourself less and less able to accurately describe your anarchism with *one* particular label. All you can do is list the schools of thought that have influenced you rather than define you. For myself the main items are pretty typical: syndicalism, mutualism (in its socialist varieties) and to a lesser extent anarchocommunism (in the sense of community politics) and individualism (in its less dogmatic and rhetorical form). Above all I'm a gradualist. People who have influenced me in that direction include Proudhon (most of the time), Pi y Margall, Colin Ward, Joan Piero, Paul Goodman and a few others. Also many people who don't carry the @ label such as Jane Jacobs, Ivan Illich, Maurice Brinton and a few libertarian Marxists. 




 I really think that the high cost of living in the Vancouver area might just be due a itsy, bitsy, tiny bit to the real estate market which is something of a bubble. 




 Thanks. I just saw it way down at the bottom. Looks like I neglected to add the name to the post. Never saw that site before. I'm going to have to add it to my list. 




 In terms of simple economics the matter of minimum wages is not as clear cut as some conservative ideologues would like to make out. In terms of its connection with employment/unemployment levels I've argued the subject multiple time. In normal circumstances it has **no** effect on unemployment levels.

In this case, in the matter of services provided to the government of the City of Vancouver by private contractors (most of the actual government employees are covered by union contracts that guarantee them far more than the amount mentioned), it will most likely have absolutely no effect whatsoever on competitive advantage. The government simply doesn't contract out across borders to any appreciable extent and neither does it 'sell' to the outside. It's a local market that stops a few miles out of city limits. In terms of the local economy the effect would be stimulatory, increasing the funds in circulation. 




 I'm afraid I don't. I'll see if I can find it on the internet, but I doubt that it's available. Possibilities = 1)it was influenced by said book, 2) Berthier is a member of said group, 3)it was written by someone heavily influenced by the book, up to the point of paraphrase or 4) it's actually a crib from said book without attribution (shame, shame). I'll see what I can find out.

Part 4, the conclusion and my own thoughts, will follow soon. 




 There have been other attempts at unionization of bike couriers in various cities. I'm afraid that I am not current enough on the subject to say if any of them "stuck". 




 I'd imagine that they would be. Earth-based 'cloaking' is already well advanced. My first thought would be that they would establish a small nearby observation post (Mars, the Moon ?) from which they could keep track of things without being detected. If you were to believe 'flying saucer' stories then you have to assume that technological advance doesn't go hand in hand with caution and common sense. Or another hypothesis - they are galactic teases. Of course we shouldn't necessarily assume the usual human motivations to extraterrestrial life. Who knows. 




 I wonder ho you say "slumming" in Antarrese ? 




 No, you're right. It is a possibility.  




 Sort of "why *didn't* the chicken cross the road" ? 




 From an extraterrestrial point of view Earth may be "a nice place to visit, but nobody would want to live there". In any case it's pretty obvious that Earthlings aren't popular as dinner guests. Bad manners. Bad manners. 




 I hate to say it, but that went through my mind as well. I assume 'adult diapers'. The main brand that I am familiar with is called `Depends, but I`m sure there are others. 




 Thanks. It skipped my mind that when I cross post an article the links don't travel with it and I have to insert them again in the new texts. Good catch. 




 Neat. Thanks very much. 




 Communities of true believers are the same whatever the subject of the true belief is. As examples there are certainly more ex-Trotskyists at any given time than there are actual Trotskyists. As for true believing Marxist Leninists of a non-Trotskyist character well, all that I can say is that it will take a few decades before all the exes die off and the few hundreds of ignorant youngsters could outnumber the 'formers'. There are religious sects like that as well. The Jehovahs are the great example.

No doubt even anarchism sheds adherents over time, and this is nothing new. All that I can say to that is rather than going down the old 'rejection road' it is perhaps better to seek out a *better* anarchism to replace the childish one first adopted. Unlike religious or political cults there is no inherent barrier to such maturation. 




 I suppose you might find such claims in Bolshevik and later USSR propaganda at the time. You won't, however, find them verified in any reliable academic source if for no other reason than aside from two rather outr circumstances it would be physically impossible. I'll tell you why.

Let's begin by granting, for the sake of argument, that the anarchist groups were bloodthirsty thugs who would be more than happy to commit such atrocities if they could. If you believe a lot of the history written by Mennonites who emigrated to the West every single side (there were many) in the Civil War, except for them, of course, were barbaric, but the Makhnovists were the worst of the lot. Leave that situation aside because the Mennonites were as far from being Bolshevik sympathizers as it is possible to be. Let's situate the whole question.

First of all the anarchists. They were far less influential than anarchists often like to pretend. Aside from the Makhnovist army there were literally *no* other anarchist armed forces worth noting anywhere in Russia during the course of the Civil War. As to Kronstadt it should be noted that the anarchists were not a major force in that insurrection as well. In the last election held for the Kronstadt Soviet before the rebellion the anarchists gained all of 5% of the votes. The most influential political force amongst the sailors was probably the SR-Maximalists, a trend that some have described as being' half way between the Socialist Revolutionaries and the anarchists. In terms of sheer numbers the largest group of rebels was comprised of members of the Bolshevik Party who had left it in disgust in the years up to 1921. The *only* leader that historians label as 'anarchist, 'Stefan Petrichenko' was just such a person, and his career both before and after Kronstadt was 'checkered' to say the least.

Now, more importantly, there is the matter of the Bolsheviks and the peasantry. In 1917 the peasants comprised about 100 million people, 80% of the population. In December 1917, two months after the Revolution, the Bolshevik Party had the 'enormous' amount of members of peasant origin of 4,122. This was actually an improvement. In 1916 the Party had a total of *four* rural cells amongst this population of 100 million. At the Sixth part Congress in July/August 1917 there were **NO** peasant delegates. The first figure means that for every card carrying communist that they wanted to kill the 'anarchists' would have had to do in about 25,000 ordinary people if they operated purely on chance selection.

The Bolsheviks, of course, recognized their massive weakness in rural areas, and they made great efforts to recruit amongst the peasantry. By 1921 the Communist Party had grown rapidly to about 700,000 members. Too rapid for some. It was time for a purge. At that time there were about 197,000 'peasant' members, about 0.2% of the rural population. The Party purged about 98,500 of them. Even though the purge was partially directed at the left opposition within the Party its major rationale was to get rid of 'careerists' ie those who joined for monetary reasons. Keep this in mind. It will be important in untangling the claim of 'anarchist massacres of communist peasants'. In any case I'm sure that this would make the anarchists' murderous task much easier. Now they would only have had to go through a thousand peasants to get a commie as opposed to 25,000.

The purge had its rationale. The 'peasant' Bolsheviks were an interesting lot. Understand what the Bolsheviks were doing in the years of 'War Communism'. Basically they would send out detachments from the cities into the countryside for two purposes. One was to steal grain, so-called 'requisitions'. The other was to forcibly conscript peasants into the Red Army. When they were available they would send out workers with some sort of connection to the village in question, but such were rarely available. The detachments were basically looting expeditions and kidnapping squads. Once in a village they would try to enlist local collaborators who, of course, became members of the Communist Party. The character of these collaborators, *some* of whom were purged in 1921, is best described by the following from Samuel Farber's 'Before Stalinism: The Rise and Fall of Soviet Democracy';

Thus, among the new post-revolutionary rural Communists were to be found priests, former Tsarist policemen and government employees interested in advancing their careers.

Aside from the weakness of the anarchists another thing should be understood, the strength of the traditional party of the peasantry, the Socialist Revolutionaries. If one were to enumerate support for this incredibly disorganized and ineffective party its supporters would have vastly outnumbered those of the Bolsheviks even at the height of the latter's popularity. Besides being fractured, however, the SRs had other millstones around their necks. One was simple confusion about what they wanted. The SRs were long on good sounding rhetoric and short on practicality. Long on high sounding principles and short on details. The left SRs, who were in coalition with the Bolsheviks in the early months after October also carried a romantic attachment to terrorist tactics - totally useless in a civil war.

At the beginning of the revolution the peasants had a certain ill-informed sympathy for the Bolsheviks whom Lenin dragged kicking and screaming into a defeatist position and in  support of the peasant land expropriations which were generally taking place without the influence of *any* political party. He also convinced the Party to add the simplistic slogan of 'Bread' to those of 'Peace' and 'Land'. In the end the Bolsheviks delivered peace, stood aside in the face of the fact of land seizures and drew the country into a situation where the 'Bread' of 1917 looked like paradise in comparison to the famines during their fight for power, some of which was due to their theft of grain.

During the course of the Civil War the Bolsheviks faced peasant rebellions that literally numbered in the **hundreds**. I emphasize that. Hundreds ! Many more of these such as the Tambov Rebellion were inspired by the SRs as compared to the limited number inspired by anarchists. Even so the great majority were inspired by the natural resistance of people to thieves and kidnappers. It didn't require a political party for people to rise up against exploiters such as the Bolsheviks. The Bolshevik advantage was that these natural rebellions were almost always local and lacked coordination. There was also a great animosity between the right and left wings of the SRs. The former were willing to collaborate with the Whites; for the latter it was totally out of the question.

In the end the Bolsheviks won more because of the disorganization and outright stupidity of their opponents. Of the various White commanders only Wrangel was willing to make a small number of concessions to popular feelings, and these were indeed minor. Commanders like Kolchak, Kornilov, Yudenich or Denikin carried out a brutal campaign of slaughter and repression in whatever territories they controlled. As for the anarchists besides being minor players outside of eastern Ukraine they had other problems. If you like I could enumerate them. I'm an anarchist myself, but I'm a greater believer in truth. A lot of anarchists engage in wishful thinking in regards to Russia and the anarchist role in the revolution.

So to conclude this incredibly long reply there were simple reasons that the anarchists didn't 'murder Bolshevik peasants'. One is that, outside of eastern Ukraine there simply weren't enough anarchists to do any such thing. A large number of Russian anarchists who were anarchosyndicalists were just as much an urban phenomena as the Bolsheviks. The other reason is that the beast known as 'Communist peasants' basically didn't exist. There were detachments sent out from the cities to steal and kidnap. There were also small numbers of local collaborators who were usually not peasants at all. I am fairly confident in saying that there was not a *single* village in all of Russia where the majority were Bolshevik supporters by the time the spring of 1918 rolled along.

One more thing. Anarchists and more frequently SRs did indeed kill the occasional 'Bolshevik peasant' by accident when they killed other peasants. Amongst the anarchists there were those mentally ill 'individualists' who believed in individual acts of terror. When they attacked the general population with bombs or in robberies they may have killed a rare Bolshevik peasant by accident. These incidents were mercifully rare. Much more significant were those peasants forcibly conscripted into the Red Army as it deployed to fight the anarchists, SRs or ordinary peasants. A small number of those would have been Bolshevik sympathizers, but even though they outnumbered the innocent victims of idiotic terrorism they were still uncommon. These were the two 'outr circumstances' that I mentioned at the beginning.
 




 Not to my knowledge. What specific question do you think might be answered by such research ? I'd think that the general profile of isolated communities would show an increased level of relatedness. Other than that perhaps it might be useful in comparative studies of the general Swedish population. 




 Tons upon tons. All that I can do is French and Spanish, but there is a great ocean out there of items in such languages as Italian, Portuguese, German, Russian, etc.. I've been a long time admirer of your work. I particularly found your piece on Flora Tristan valuable. Please feel free to post items here at your convenience. Forgotten Anarchism is specifically targeted to translations of women anarchists of which you have done many. Have you done any of my favourite, Isidine/Korn/Goldsmith/Goldschmidt ? It's well looking into. She was the main force amongst Russian exiles in France in the late 19th/early 20th century. She was also Kropotkin's most frequent correspondent and translated his 'Ethics' into French from the Russian. Also a book by the Russian SR Lavrov. Makhno's secretary for awhile. It goes on and on. In terms of disputes she had the ability to find a middle position on pretty well any issue - which didn't endear her to many. Everybody on both sides would assume she was supporting the other side.

I was browsing through La Frondeuse from your link, and I found something you might not be aware of. Most of the links are working, but those that link to 'previous issues' of La Frondeuse end up as 'page not found'. Have a look at it if you have time.

Take care. B.

 It doesn't seem to be a problem for me. In any case...

""*WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)  Calling the Obama Administrations actions against the soccer organization weak and ineffective, Senator John McCain on Thursday proposed military action to dismantle and destroy FIFA once and for all.

These are people who only understand one thing: force, McCain said on the floor of the United States Senate. We must make FIFA taste the vengeful might and fury of the United States military.

McCain said that he was completely unimpressed by the Department of Justices arrests of several top FIFA lieutenants this week, calling the action the kind of Band-Aid solution that this Administration, sadly, has become famous for.

Rounding up a few flunkies in a hotel is meaningless when the leader of FIFA remains at large, he said. I will follow Sepp Blatter to the gates of Hell.

McCain requested a four-billion-dollar aid package for moderate elements within global soccer, and said that the United States should be prepared to put boots on the ground in Switzerland.

Calling the use of force against FIFA long overdue, he placed the blame for the groups alarming growth squarely on the shoulders of the White House. Barack Obama created FIFA, he said."*
 




 The debate will never end. Pluto has friends everywhere. 




 This puzzled me for a bit. I found what you were talking about in a comment to the original article at Nordic Science. It wasn't me, by the way. It's strange if for no other reason than it is totally disconnected with the subject of the article. Oh well. 




 I wonder how the two languages compare. Also Faroese. I always thought that Icelandic was the closest to Old Norse. 




 Thanks for the link. It's very informative.  




 Welcome. I guess the first sentence refers to a post at r/communismworldwide. The first post doesn't seem to be here. Feel free to post that as well. I wasn't aware that there was such a thing as post-scarcity *Marxism*. I've definitely seen it *hinted* at over the years but not stated bluntly.

I think it is a mistake for anarchists to assume that their will be one and only one economic system in the future. Various methods of distribution and of production each have their benefits and drawbacks. I think that experimentation is and would be the order of the day. The only restrictions on this would be that central planning by a state or a *completely free market that allowed or encouraged monopoly would not be worth striving for. 

In any case I think that a mixed economy would be the best and perhaps the *only* system that would be efficient, democratic, liberating for the individual, ecologically and socially stable and perhaps even *possible*. A totally open, moneyless system of distribution in which all goods and services would be open to all takers, essentially complete anarchocommunism which 'post-scarcity' says is possible is neither desirable nor possible. Let's deal with the possible part first.

Personally I think that it is an essential part of anarchism, as it should be for any socialism, that the basic necessities of life are provided to all people, regardless of their position in a system of production. Everyone should have housing, food, clothing, opportunity for personal development, mobility within reason, electricity, running water, sewage and garbage service, etc., etc., etc.. All of these are such that they *should* be distributed free which is in  fact anarchocommunism in practice if not in the sense of a complete system.

There are, however, things for which there is a **natural** scarcity. Everybody should have shoes, but personally designed ones are, of necessity, scarce. Everyone should have mobility, but not everyone in the whole world who *wants* to go to Venice should arrive there all at once. It's basically elbow room only at certain times of the year as it is when it costs money. Not everyone can have an original Picasso hanging on the wall. Everyone should have decent clothing, but if the idea of 'fashion' persists in a freer society I can't see either the need nor the possibility of this being provided free. Everyone should have decent food, but the desire for gourmet cooking with exotic ingredients can't be satisfied for a whole society at no cost. Everyone should have decent housing, but not everyone who wants to live in a palace can be satisfied. The list goes on and on.

My own viewpoint is that a basic decent life should always be available free of charge, but that a secondary exchange economy, a market if you will, should run in parallel for those goods and services that are simply *not* infinite. I differ from left libertarians like most American mutualists in that I would see more of the economy socialized than they would because I don't have the faith in some market that they do.

There are other arguments against a totally socialized economy, but I will restrict myself to natural scarcity for now. Your opinion is that food is one of the items which are naturally scarce. This is at least *partially* true, but it's a complicated matter that I'll try and speak to later.

By the way, thank you for the post. This is the sort of rational dialogue that I'd like there to be more of.

You raise a number of issues, but I'll speak to only one for now. Others later 




 Thank you. You're probably right. The 'Elf' just struck me as amusing. As to the picture, however, you must admit that it is damn hard to get a picture of a real elf. Camera-shy big time.

What struck me about your post was something else; 'dalen' as valley. English still has at least one word derived from the same root ie "dale" which is another name for valley. Admittedly it isn't used much these days. Out of sheer curiosity I'm going to try and find any English words other than 'elf' that derive from Old Norse, Old Germanic, etc.. 




 I hope the lesson took on them. 




 I don't believe so. 




 The side bar definition seems fairly reasonable to me. If it was up to me I'd expand it (the side bar) a bit in terms of 'democratic decision making' at the base of such a society, in both the workplace and the community. I'd also expand it in terms of the federalism that is necessary to run such a society ie the institutional cooperation between workplaces and communities, both local and distant. Sort of adding the 'fraternit' to the .egalit'. 




 The last is indeed the big question. The planned mission will, at best, find evidence for a "possibility" for life not any proof. 




 Quite connected to 'Bakunin against insurrectionism' 




 You are certainly right. The article referenced has the 'give-away' term 'some' in the body of the article itself. 




 Thanks for the clarification. 




 I remember a few years ago when there was a big copyright fight, and one archive (I believe it was the Marxists.org archive) had to remove some of their material. I see that this is being posted from Mexico, and copyright might be different there.

In any case there's a problem in the presentation. If you enlarge the text so that it is readable you find that it is often 'seeing double'. Somehow, someway the process of uploading messed up. The result isn't unreadable, but it is difficult. 




 It depends upon what you call a "human" fossil. As for Homo sapiens the time is much shorter, 200,000 yrs BP. You are probably speaking of the origin of the genus Homo which has been dated from 1.9 mil to 2.5 mil yrs BP. The line of descent, however, goes much further back but 30 mil yrs ago there was nothing that could remotely be called human. The genus Hominoidea dates to about 25 mil yrs BP.  I don't think that the appearance of the genus Homo is any more significant than any of the other branching points. There is ongoing work on the paleoecology in east/south Africa that may have had an effect on human evolution. Climate seems to have a lot to do with the evolution of humans.

Thanks for the comment by the way. It was thought provoking. 




 Yes, it would, but loss of muscle tone during development would probably imply more serious problems that would make the embryo unviable in any case. 




 Cross post from r/worldanarchism. 




 This post reminded me of a website that I haven't heard from for some time. Finally it clicked in memory. It's called [Forgotten Anarchism](http://forgottenanarchism.wordpress.com). It a regular collection project that posts translations by anarchist women writers of the past, and it's quite interesting. The originals are so far in French, Spanish and Portuguese.  




 Yes, but said monopoly may not be an eternal thing. 




 One of the 'bads' is that sometimes recycling is not.... Cities have set up recycling systems and ended up taking the trash collected to the dump anyways. Not that this is very common, but it does happen. 




 Some of the article certainly assumed a familiarity with a lot of anatomical terms that might be difficult. I wonder if you might be looking for some sort of introductory material, and perhaps I could help. 




 Thank you. Interesting. 




 I remember reading this a few months ago and thinking it was a very good article. Looks like I'm going to reread it. If people follow the Spanish or French @s unions you'll see that they are quite active outside of the workplace. Even non-@ unions like the Longshoremen go outside the traditional bounds that more conservative unions stick to. It's something that should be a lot more frequent. 




 Not really on the subject matter of the post, but I've never seen "locked down" used in this way. 




 Sort of like a "pre-obit" ? 




 The  'blank slate' is an ideological position that is held by a small number of academics in certain disciplines, and, like you say, it is rare. On the other hand the 'nativist' position as you call it is equally rare, rare to the point of non-existent as a matter of fact. The idea that *all* human behavior is genetically determined only exists in the imagination of those who propagandize against this made-up 'enemy'. In the world of academia the whole question was settled over 25 years ago, and nowadays evolutionary psychology is a very vast and productive field in which people of very different social and political views work. The question has been settled.

Having a certain acquaintance with 'learning theory' it is obvious that the adherents of 'behaviorism' accept a biological basis. You can't do science without it. At the same time, however, those who favor a more 'nativist' approach also understand the importance of 'learning'. The whole matter is not an either/or one.

As to Skinner it has been a longer time than 25 years since I have read anything by him. I presume he has been dead for some time. I won't try and pontificate on his morality. What I will say is that the view that human emotions and opinions are infinitely malleable is a view that would-be social engineers find very comforting whether they be of left or right wing persuasions. The idea of a 'human nature' that can't be 'conditioned away' should be at the base of any left wing point of view. The views of Stalin are the same as those of Hitler on this matter. 

Like I said, I won't try and judge Skinner's morality even if I found his 'Walden Two' quite unpleasant about 40 years ago. Very few great evils in this world have been committed by people who didn't think they were doing good.  




 I gather you don't like his ideas. I don't agree with all of them myself, but what do you disagree with ? 




 As for 'marriages', at my age after a lifetime of avoiding events that require that I dress up I am at the situation where I avoid funerals more than I avoid marriages. Mercifully most of my grandnephews and grandnieces have already crossed that threshold. As for the grandchildren it's unfortunately coming up. Ick !

It's nice to be able to take a long view. As I recall the attitude towards gay people has certainly varied from time to time as you mention. This has generally gone along with a general societal view of sex in general.

Here's the important point that I guess I will have to repeat. I have only a bit of doubt that a 'bourgeois' world would have a bit of difficulty in accommodating something like gay marriage. In our present world which I chose to call 'managerial' there is no such economic barrier. In fact the general  'meritocratic' cast of the economy argues 'for' it rather than against it. We live in a different economy than that of the 1930s, let alone the Victorian Age where a view such as yours would be more accurate.

Yes, the misnamed 'bourgeois world' "approves" of it in your terms. What I would say is that people should accept this and approve of it. It's an advance towards general equality, and whether gay relationships are "boring and absurd" is irrelevant at this time in history. It's what many/most gay people want, and it is an advance that non-gay people will agree to . Not every single thing that happens in society has to be viewed in a lens of 'not enough'. 

You may indeed criticize a society on the basis of 'property relations' in marriage, but this criticism becomes less and less relevant in a society that is increasingly 'single' and in which property rights are increasingly differentiated in the legal institution of marriage. This is no longer 1890. 




 Did anyone ever take a survey on the political views of gay people rather than extrapolating from news reports and personal acquaintance ? I am *sure* that the gay community is pretty much the same as the straight community with a moderate shift to 'the left'. That shift would be expected from life experiences, but it is a mistake in my opinion to equate being gay with being 'radical'. I'm old enough to remember Stonewall if not the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis that preceded them. Very 'bourgeois' them.

Here's the trick. Something like sexual orientation is **not** a direct path to any sort of radical political or economic views. That doesn't mean that advances in the public position of gay people are not 'progressive' as it's called. It still is most definitely so. A managerial society such as ours *can* accommodate a position of equality, and it definitely *should*.  Any proper socialist should support initiatives to free gay people from discrimination/restrictions. That's part of socialism. On the other hand socialists shouldn't entertain illusions that things that can legitimately be granted under managerial society and are in the end to the benefit of such a society are some sort of inherent 'contradiction' as Marxists would say. They aren't, and I could cite Marx on the so-called 'progressive' nature of capitalism as an example of the way I view things.

The criticism of marriage that you mention was quite prominent '40 years ago'. Since then it has diminished considerably. It was a different time. You think this is unfortunate. Personally I have no opinion on whether it is good or bad. It just **is**. I take a longer view. In the absence of any great change I'll take the small changes that are possible at a given time as they come. 




 It's poking fun at a certain trend in American politics (and pretty well nowhere else in the world today) where the message of the NT is distorted in the service of certain current political views. 




 All contemporary rhetoric aside socialism has always held the concept of 'equality' as a good. Thus any legislation that automatically denies some people a 'social good' while granting it to others is against the principles of socialism. This hasn't always been recognized in all places at all times, but it is an inevitable logical conclusion. Thus, it is relevant to socialism in the same way that restrictions on this or that ethnic group are. Suppose you were a socialist who for whatever reason thought that a gay orientation was 'immoral'. Even if you held that position you would still have to accept the recognition of gay marriage if you wished to still consider yourself 'socialist'. 

This relates to another contemporary question, that of abortion. Shall we say you are a 'member' (not an accurate description - 'believer' would be better) of the 'Catholic Left'. As such you will usually oppose abortion, but, for the sake of consistency, you will *not* seek legal prohibitions on it, but will rather argue against it in a free forum of ideas. People on the 'Catholic Left' are usually socialist in one way or another, and they resolve the contradiction in this way. 




 Thank you for the reference. I haven't read the paper before, but a quick skim says that it's a valuable source. The hypothesis predates 1999 (the date of the paper), but this seems like a good review in reference to Homo erectus. Once more thanks. 




 "Who would Jesus bomb ?" Or maybe picture the Holy Spirit as a drone ? 




 I have no doubt they are "speaking" in their new jobs. They are also "walking" to the meetings with their friends, "writing or emailing" their friends, influencing other to do favors and so on and so forth. Let them do it, but let them not get paid for it. That's the difference. You can say that Caesar should be killed in the streets of Rome, but that's different from supplying the daggers. 




 Not really. It is, of course, a "change in life history" **but** the *potential* for such a change could easily be a "spandrel". I'll present a simple example. Suppose we take the prevalence of genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. I would presume that there would be selection against such genes, and I would presume that the selection pressure would be stronger in past times when breast cancer was a death sentence. OK, that's the original "selection". Said selection would operate even in the conditions where a human ancestor was more likely to die "before old age" due to things like falls and Saber-Tooth tigers *because* even young women get breast cancer albeit at a lower rate than old women.

Now fast forward to today (or the last 100 years in *part* of the world). Even though women have less chance of dying young from all the Sabertooths wandering around the selection pressure still exists even if it is diminished. Older women have a *higher* chance of getting breast cancer than younger ones do. Relieve the "cut-off" of early death and the effect of selection against BRCA 1 and 2 doesn't just remain - the effect of its removal is **magnified** in demographic surveys because more older women live through breast cancer of which they have a higher incidence.

This is a classic incidence of a 'spandrel'. The selection is *not* for anything like increased lifespan after fertility. It is an example of where selection for one thing has unexpected events in a difference situation. The selection was *not* for the longevity that wasn't a usual situation 'back then'. It was for something quite different, but it has benefit in a new situation. This means it is....a spandrel. 




 Give him a break. Who do you think he is - God ? 




 Well, they're definitely not "turning the other cheek" except that of the victim to double-slap them. I've read the Bible, but it's been quite a few years. All the same I find it quite amazing how ignorant some believers are about the book they claim to follow.  With my old person's memory I am pretty sure that I have forgotten much more than they have ever learned, and I still know much more than they ever will. 




 The 'New Alabama Version^TM' I presume. 




 I checked. The part that you heard was when they were talking about Sainte-Marie's being blacklisted, not about government actions against native nations in general. Ste.-Marie lays the blame for the actions against her on *individuals* rather than any written government policy in any inter-office memo. What she is saying is true in a strictly legal sense. It also fits in very well with her general point of view that individuals are much more important than institutions. It's the way she views the world.

I also was reminded of the title of the song 'These Ones' that was in my mind. It's 'Now that the buffalos gone'. Going over the article carefully also brought another thing to light. I can remember Ste.-Marie on Sesame Street, but I never realized how long it has been since she moved to Hawaii. It registered today that it's been over 30 years. Hum. 




 Yes, but I think that the idea is that such individuals were 'helpers', and more children of theirs and their relatives 'survived'. 




 Thanks for the link. 




 That doesn't sound like Sainte-Marie, but there may be a certain subtle context here. In some of her songs she presents the listener with a challenge. Two pop into my mind. Excuse me, I am bad with song titles. I tend to remember them via 'key phrases'  rather than printed title. I'm thinking of 'Soldier Blue' and 'These Ones'. In both cases she mentions 'the government', of course, but she also challenges non-native people to oppose the actions of said government. The *emphasis* is not on the evil actions of the state but rather on the moral *obligation* to take a stand against the actions.

I'll check the transcript to see if this possibility is correct. 




 I believe that Stephan J. Gould would have called such unintended consequences 'spandrels' as in his essay taking the metaphor of St. Mark's in Venice. Quite frankly I'm agnostic about an adaptive explanation in this case as I believe the paper's author was. 




 If reproduction happened towards the end of an animal's life and the progeny would die without maternal care there would be no selective pressure for such late reproduction to persist. I think the author is talking about reproduction that is not "on the edge of the grave". It seems that there would be a 'balance' of selective pressures. As the article discusses animals in captivity show post-reproduction longevity that isn't evident in the wild. This implies that the 'risks of life' are such that such a balance exists under natural conditions, and that the scenario you discuss is a very unlikely one. 




 The journal 'Trends in Ecology and Evolution' is published by Cell Press, a branch of Elsevier. Yes, it is a reputable journal. I don't know if I understand your first point correctly, but it seems you are criticizing what is actually the common usage in these sort of papers. People routinely say that a certain trait is selected "for" or "against", and their statements contain the *implied* name of a trait that is the *opposite* of the trait they are speaking of. I know you are probably implying that a 'selectionist' argument for the origin of post-reproduction longevity doesn't necessarily follow from its contradiction of the expectation quoted above.

Now that's true, and the article in fact discusses this along with a number of other open questions surrounding the phenomena of this longevity. It's a *review* article not a report of results from original investigation, and as such it is open ended. It doesn't advance any firm answers. The point you raise is discussed in the context of comparisons of humans to other animals that show post-reproductive longevity *in captivity* but not *in the wild*. It's an interesting point to ponder. 




 That's a possibility, but it depends on what its competitors are doing at the time. How oligarchic is the industry and how much opportunity is there for collusion in such things ? Personally I don't know. 




 Oh shit. My mistake. I am demanding a full confession from my middle right hand finger. 




 He lived to 98 if I recall correctly, and he was active politically in pacifist/anti-nuclear weapon groups right up to the end. I have a mental picture stored in memory of a photo of this incredibly old guy at a demonstration. 




 I wouldn't call that "idiotic" at all. One of the hallmarks of scientific inquiry when it is quantitative is that it *always* admits to the possibility of error and tries to estimate the probability of such error. 




 You are **completely** insane. 




 Thank you. I read the first, but it was many years ago. I've never read the second. I have a stack of his books, and I'll look through it to see if I have it. 




 Really ??? If someone makes a claim the 'burden' is on those who disagree to *prove the negative* ? That's an old one. In any case **I** claim that you owe me every single penny that you have, and I'd like this debt to be paid **SOON**. The burden is, of course, on *you* to prove my claim is false. The next knock on your door will be from the repo-man. 




 Well, that is true. The trick is that it takes a massive amount of self-deception to convince yourself of certainty in every aspect of life. No doubt people need a certain amount of 'certainty' if for no other reason than to avoid paralysis. Yet it is impossible to have this all the time in human life. Russell says that philosophy 'trains' you to live with this. Whether this is true or not I don't know. 




 That seems reasonable to me. Sorry, I didn't notice the flair button. It seems pretty light on the board. 




 Are you sure about that ? Sorry, I had to do it. 




 Well that too, but as Russell might say you have to be uncertain about it. 




 I imagine that this isn't the only 'card-trick' that Walmart is pulling. 




 That's an interesting interview. One point, however, is never addressed. Nader doesn't seem to condemn Sanders' choice to run for the Democratic nomination as opposed to running as an independent. He weighs the pros and cons and refrains from making a judgement. That's fine. What is missing is the possibility/probability that *both* paths are futile in the American political system, a system that massively handicaps any challenger from outside the 'corporate consensus'. I'd be willing to say that participation in national elections is n exercise in futility. Nader doesn't seem to want to come to grips with that. 




 I agree. It's a very valuable mission. 




 Yes, that is the scenario that suggested itself to me. 




 Yes, but to be replaced by **what** ? Perhaps something far worse. 




 At the same time as some other countries are trying to get out of the nuclear industry. 




 Just a little thing on Zerzan. Have a quick look at his history. You'll find he's done a lot of travelling. Quite a lot ! Like many such people of his opinions he has *easily* dumped the greenhouse gas equivalent of 10 to 20 ordinary people into the atmosphere. Go outside of the USA to take your sample. In some countries the numbers would run into the hundreds. There are so many old sayings..."do as I say, not as I do", the Biblical tales of hypocrisy(motes/beams, sepulchers), "those who can do and those who can't teach", etc.. 




 You're welcome. 




 The latest news on this is that the Mexican government has offered to mediate between the growers and the workers. They say that they will 'top up' any offer from the growers to a wage level they (the government) feels is adequate. The growers will, of course, 'bid low' in such a situation, and the result will be a government subsidy to their businesses. It's unknown at this time if the government offer is acceptable to the workers. 




 I don't think so. It would merely imply a system with feedback. 




 Or writes, types, says, yells, broadcasts, sends by smoke signals, communicates, sends by semaphore flags, sends telepathically, calls for, warns, paints, grunts, whispers, mumbles, etc.,etc.. The noun as a subject doesn't guarantee that there is a separate conscious entity with intent that 'does' the verb. The wind may 'warn' you of oncoming rain. The position of the Sun may say that the day is almost over. 




 Well done.  




 I'd agree that that is certainly a factor. 




 I'd guess so though it doesn't seem to connect to idealism in my opinion. "I" is a subject pronoun ie something that does something. "Me" is an object pronoun ie something that is the object of either a verb or a preposition. The first pronoun is an actor, the second something that is acted upon. You use "construct" as a noun, but it comes from the verb "to construct" in the same sense as "building" is to "to build". The difference is built into the English language. 




 To whomever thinks that they perceive such a thing I'd guess. 




 Corporatism is *definitely* a word. Historically it meant one of the most important points in the definition of fascism. It means that employers and workers are *compelled* to sit down together in regular planning organizations under the tutelage and with the participation of the state so as to govern and plan the economy. The ideological justification of this is that the population is supposed to work together for the benefit of 'the nation'. These days this sort of management is more often called "tripartism". It exists in all developed countries to one degree or another and with various organizational mechanisms.  




 Well, it's a possible alternative story to the official one. I'm still agnostic about it though. The main sticking point for me in the official version is why on Earth would they dump the body overboard. 




 Thanks. 




 Well, I'd agree with the caveat of "in most circumstances" ie not always. Other than that we're saying the same thing, disagreeing with the claim of the Prime Minister. 




 I don't think so. It's hard to quantify this sort of thing. There is opposition to the socioeconomic structure in pretty well all countries all the time. Where do you draw the line and say this or that event/organization/struggle/etc. is active enough to go in say a 'plus column'. Judging this sort of thing can end up very subjective. That being said I would (subjectively) say that 2015 is less 'active' than say 2011 (Occupy, Indignados, Arab Spring), and I think it would be hard to argue otherwise. 




 What city is the school located in ? 




 I would go with Oceania because I think it is more descriptive of Pacific islands. As for Cuba how about 'Central America/Caribbean' instead of just 'Central America' ? Thanks for the work. 




 Slightly edited for length - B 




 I never knew that (that it was invented by a gay man). Can you tell the story ? 




 Yes, I've seen people blaze through crossings and even weave around lowered barriers. It certainly happens. 




 Yes, that can happen, but it's unfortunately rare. More frequent though still uncommon is a worker refusal to collect user fees from customers/users/etc. . This tactic has been used in the case of public services such as transportation.

EDIT: I should also add, of course, that there have been instances of 'recuperated' workplaces where production is indeed taken over by the workers and collection by the employer is terminated. The most outstanding example would be the numerous workplace takeovers in Argentina, but there are other examples. The factory in Thessalonica in Greece and a bicycle factory in Germany come to mind, but there are undoubtedly many other examples, some successful, some failures. 




 I'm unfamiliar with Warren's history. Did she actually used to be a Republican ? 




 It's a burgeoning field indeed. There are definitely papers that connect the microbiome with neuroscience. As to developmental neuroscience I'm not too sure. 




 Maybe, but the gradual move away from organized religion began decades before there was such a thing as Facebook. Also, unfortunately, a lower rate of social ties extends beyond the realm of religion. It's been given many names, anomie, alienation, etc., and it goes beyond theological beliefs.  




 The Hubble is observing in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum for two reasons. One is that it gives a good method to estimate the age of a given white dwarf because as it cools the emissions become less energetic ie change to a smaller frequency/longer wavelength. The second is that it is useful in identifying said stars. The dwarfs *begin* with high radiation in the ultraviolet as compared to an ordinary star because their previous evolution has 'blown away' the outer layers that 'shielded' the hottest part of the star, the core. In a normal star the ultraviolet radiation from the core is absorbed by the outer layers. I hope this clears up the confusion. 




 The article is from the 'Global Times', published in China with the *permission*, if not with the complete oversight, of the authorities. It takes an aggregate of the top and bottom 20% and compares them. No doubt if you were to take the top 0.1% or 1% the ratio would perhaps be even more astounding than 2 orders of magnitude.

What is remarkable is how far China has progressed in that income inequality is a subject for journalism at all. The numbers may be 'massaged', but the simple admission is a sign of progress. 




 You're right. It's the original unaltered title so I didn't make the oops. 




 A lot of things are 'beneath the notice' of the US mass media. World news, of course, cuts into the time allotted to charting the lives of celebrities. One current example is the present scandal surrounding sexual assault on minors by US military personnel stationed in Colombia. It's a big item in Latin America but rarely mentioned domestically even though it *does* involve the USA directly. 




 It seems like a metaphoric way of saying 1)that he won't grant the demands and 2) increasing wages will simply be eaten up by inflation due to the raises. The part "beyond what the state can offer or has proposed" seems repetitious, but it has an escape hatch if he does decide to compromise. Like any politician or manager he will keep saying 'no' right up to the very hour he does 'yes'. If the unions win (or half win) it will suddenly be discovered that the state *can offer* more than before.

As to the matter of the connection between wages and inflation that is quite a complex matter. There is no one-to-one correspondence between wage rates and inflation. Inflation rates are measured in different ways by different organizations with different 'weighting' of consumer items. Some of these, especially imports. are very insensitive to wage rates in a given country.

I'll give an very simple example - bananas. I think we can be certain that there are no banana plantations in Iceland, and all the bananas are imported. They probably arrive by plane, but there is a small chance they arrive by ship. I don't know. Suppose that the wages of say 40% of Icelanders go up. The cost of importing bananas remains essentially the same. The wages of Icelandic pilots, longshoremen or truck drivers represent a minimal fraction of the cost to the seller in Iceland of those bananas. Now will their increased resources due to higher wages lead a significant number of Icelanders to start eating bananas with every meal ? No. That would be incentive for a retailer in Iceland to increase the price because of higher demand, hence contribute to inflation if bananas are part of the 'consumer basket'. But it doesn't happen. The demand for bananas is not elastic in terms of consumer income.

This is, of course, a simple, even simplistic, example, but many other items are similar. Hence the lack of direct correlation between wage increases and inflation. 




 Yep, if you're in the boxing ring don't pull your punches. 




 Or possibly *very quiet* aside from demonstrations. When these sort of things are done in various countries the unions involved make sure to preserve a skeleton staff for essential services. For instance the electricity would still flow, but you wouldn't be able to pay your bill, nor visit the power company office, nor get a person on the phone so you could complain. No doubt this sort of situation is eventually unstable. It usually ends with everything going back to normal with either gains or losses for the workers involved. In rare cases (certainly not in Iceland) either military repression or the fall of the government happens.

So no, not chaos because a lot of day to day activity in a society can indeed be set aside for awhile. Also the action of the strike movement may appear chaotic to some because it poses a threat to their interests, but it is anything but chaotic to the participants.  




 There have been cases where companies have done *exactly* that, simply tap into the municipal water supply. 




 The sponsoring organization, Amnesty International, isn't noted for its "shadiness". They have had a stellar record over the decades. You will also note that there is *no* appeal for funds, merely online support. It's not like you are watching a televangelist. As to another to possible sources of doubt: Yes Paraguay *does* have such laws. The arrest of the criminal stepfather was announced on many media outlets yesterday. Google 'Paraguay abortion' and see the coverage. Finally, ten year old girls *can* become pregnant. It's rare, but it happens.

I hope that this may answer your doubts. 




 Perhaps she already has and he either said 'no' or, more likely, said it would only happen with sufficient public pressure.  




 It's hard to say what's happening in Raul Castro's mind. It *could* be pure apple polishing. On the other hand there is always a certain nostalgia in the minds of ex-Catholics. Once you get over the anger at the Church you come to appreciate the attractions (mostly not theological) of the tradition. It's not that you wrestle over the doctrine. It's more like you appreciate the art, the music, the lives of (some !) saints, etc.. As for the doctrine... well people have a nostalgia for their childhood as well. 




 Jones definitely. Not Alex but rather *Jim* Jones of People's Temple fame and the bane of the makers of Kool-Aid. A lot of the people 'over there' with free market views are **very** open in labelling his following as a cult, just like the Ayn Rand cult. His only saving grace is greed. His desire to keep raking in the money is likely the main thing holding him back from a dive straight into the deep end. 




 Mostly but not entirely right. While not as accurate and precise as sampling from several stations worldwide historical CO2 levels can be estimated from ice cores. From these the CO2 level is the highest in 11,000 years. 




 Thank you. That's interesting news. 




 Yep, it has been looked at. Over at the [California Department of Water Resources](http://www.water.ca.gov/desalination) (a busy place these days no doubt) they discuss a project initiated in 2002 that was to fund a mix of feasibility studies, pilot plants and actual operating facilities. They set up the 'California Desalination Task Force' which produced a seemingly detailed report, available on the site, in 2008. Yeah, I know, not lightening speed. I don't know the details about how all this turned out or what the situation is more recently, but I imagine there is more current material available from both this Department and other groups. 




 Yes, I can see your first point. I think that there may have been other problems with power imported by California, but what they may have been escapes my memory right now. Nuclear in an earthquake zone on the coast of the Pacific wouldn't be a good idea. Think Fukushima. In terms of fossil fuels natural gas would be the least expensive and pose the least environmental problems. But, as you point out, whatever the problems it may be the *only* solution. I wonder if the State has studied this alternative in any detail. I'm going to have a quick look. 




 Yes, it would naturally be cheaper as there would be no losses of power in transmission. It would also be a 'plus' for oil and gas exporting states, but I can't see how it would be a financial plus for California because it would be a net payment to out-of-state producers. It would, of course, be a plus in the sense of getting potable water, and it may sooner or later become a necessity. I think that the cost would be significant enough to make it necessary for the State to put up some of the seed money. It would probably be beyond the resources of a city. Then I recall that California has had troubles over its debts before. This gets more complicated the longer I think of it. 




 I don't really know, but I would guess high capital costs and high energy requirements. Saudi Arabia, no surprise there, operates desalination plants, but I don't think they supply the entire country. I also believe that some of the Gulf states do likewise. The advantage there is easy access to a constant supply of oil. 




 Thanks for this article Mike. I've mentioned RojoyNegroTV here before, but this piece is much more informative than what I presented. One thing I noticed... really and *truly* producing a proper television show and station is a lot more complicated than my limited experience told me. It's a world away from a ten minute video on YouTube for sure. I wonder if other groups such as the French FA might want to do something similar. They do, after all, produce Radio Libertaire. 




 There's undoubtedly a cost factor in the equation, but the bad publicity they were getting was a factor as well. The first may or may not be a wise economic choice given the capitalization costs of the move versus any long term savings. The latter is an avoidance of loss of income which is also factored in. 




 I once read that in the ancient Persian Empire that the court had the following way of making decisions. Everyone would get roaring, falling down, vomiting all over yourself drunk and make the decision. Then the next morning (or early afternoon) they'd look at the decision and see if it still looked as good as it did the night before. Seems 'more or less' reasonable to me. 




 It is. It shows that public pressure *can* have an effect. There has been a long-standing campaign against their plant. It is, admittedly, the proverbial drop in the bucket in the picture of California's water woes. 




 I also think the bad publicity had a lot to do with it. No doubt they will put the best spin possible on the move. Also, like every other company, they go shopping in the 'tax break market' which often contains outright gifts. They're moving to Pennsylvania though *not* Detroit. That would be about the *last* place they would consider. Whatever else you might say about the executives they aren't crazy, and neither are they drunk 24/7. 




 That was good. The British answer to 'The Onion' is running ahead of the American it seems. 




 It depends upon what you mean by "many". An accurate estimate is hard to come by, but let's try something with a few assumptions. Let's set up a little game of 'statistics'. The first thing you have to understand - and accept and realize the implications of - is that for every person who may criticize Obama "from the left" there are something like 20,000 people of other political views. I may be *generous* to 'the left' with this, and I am lumping in *all* forms of leftism in one mass.

Now let's assume that about 50% of these people with *other* views are more or less approving of Obama and either ignorant of or in disagreement with the views of people 'to the left of Obama'. That leaves a number of the order of about 10,000. This means that for every 'leftist' post on a place like r/socialism if you went by pure chance there would be 10,000 people hitting on it who like Obama and only one who looks at him 'from the left'. 

Here comes the tricky part. How many of these people might have a more or less favourable view of a word like 'socialism'. This varies from country to country. It would be lowest in the USA but higher in other parts of the 'anglosphere' such as Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and goodly numbers of people in countries such as India, Pakistan, etc. where English is a lingua franca in multilingual nations. Let's try and set a low enough number such as 5%, one in 20. This reduces the likelihood to 500 to one that the viewer would be such an 'Obama friendly' person.

There are, of course, other factors that reduce this still further. Suppose that only 10% of the population are interested enough in politics to cruise the internet looking for subjects such as Obama (a quite high number) or socialism (a lower number). Now we're down to 50 to 1. A certain number immediately flee when they see their Saint criticized, are already heavily prejudiced against Obama and the left in general (already accounted for above), react with anger at the criticism, don't think it's important and skip over it or have sensible arguments about why "Obama is still a better deal" because of realism. Let's say 90% to 95% of the population bow out because of such things. That still leaves 2.5 to 5 people made up of 'Obama believers' to one 'lefty believer'.

Now the final reduction. From pure 'interest' let's say that a 'lefty' is 100 times more likely to keep coming back to a place like r/socialism. This leaves a 2.5 to 5 percent chance that an 'Obama believer' might see such an item and that it registers. This compares *very* favourably with the chances of the usual leftist propaganda, a goodly amount of which is *much* more likely to drive people away than to make the average person reconsider.

Yes, there is a small but not infinitesimal chance that this might do some good. I hope, but don't necessarily believe, that socialists of all stripes might actually *want* to spread their ideas and don't depend on 'conversion experiences' such that other people will accept their views all in a lump like St. Paul on the way to Damascus. It's better and far more likely to change opinions bit by bit. I *know* that certain purist rhetoric drives people away in huge numbers, and I also hope that if it is unlikely that people of different views might visit a site such as r/socialism that people would have enough common sense to understand that this is a **bad thing** that should be changed and nothing to be proud of. I *did* post the item in other places as well by the way.

 




 There's a benefit from learning *any* language even if you aren't fluent in them. Simply knowing words or phrases or grammar points can open your mind and allow you to see many things more clearly. 




 It may be predictable, but it is also a 'spanner in the works' for some people who are great believers in St. Obama.
