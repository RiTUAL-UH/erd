 I truly hope i never see flying mounts in WildStar. As a long time WoW player, before flying mounts were introduced, traveling was exciting! You had to be careful not to aggro mobs or perhaps fight your way through areas, you got to see other players along the way and see the monsters they were fighting, you had to meander your way through the environment and sometimes you'd discover hidden, tucked away NPCs and villages you never knew existed before. It made the game feel alive!

Once flying mounts were added the game felt so stale when traveling, you saw a few mountains and poorly rendered villages below that you quickly glided over in a straight line, trying to get from A to B in the fastest way possible. It was boring!

So please Carbine, never add flying mounts, keep traveling as fun as possible. 




 I feel like the questing would be amazing if they just added more voice acting, problem is that's expensive. Wonder if there are any voice actors who're fans of WildStar and would do it for free :P I know i certainly would. 




 but it still says ive got 15 wins 15 losses after a team builder game not like my 1500+ normal wins and losses :/ 




 source? 




 Riot said they'd change it this patch IIRC, but have they? 




 dunno my friend went to an all star party at some pub. Im from near Newport so dont really know much else on the matter. 




 There's even league events in Bristol :P 




 This is by far the easiest and most simpe tool, literally just press a button and it'll tell you your ping http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/19id2r/nifty_little_tool_to_check_your_ping_na_and_euw/ 




 Oh god i can see all the cosplayers that get WAY to into character being all like "EE KAA DOOO!!!!" 




 For a few patches now the mute button has been missing, it used to be next to the add friend/report/honor buttons but has since been removed. Why?

 same with annie's W which is find weird condering you can stop stuff like vel'koz's W 




 [/caitlyn] did i do it?

EDIT: fuck. 




 How the almighty shits do i lane as Yasuo? 




 As a Zed main i wish they'd fix the W + Q bug and the bug where he just stands still after using his ult 




 I added you on league and yet you're not on my friends list :( The unseen friend request is the loneliest. Y U DECLYN MI LUV? 




 The unseen Zed mains are the jealous...ist....? 




 I get accused of hacking when i play zed at least once a month. Because putting a fucking insane amount of practice into a champ cant be the reason you were able to kill me, you must be hacking! . 




 Anyone else had the annoying ult bug(?) where you're chancing an enemy and you go to cast your ult but because of the cast time you end up stopping, the enemy walks out of range and the ult never goes off, so end up stutter stepping? Has made me quite tempted to run move speed quints on her xD 




 What is OP is wrong, what if Gosu is actually Kaceytron? 




 Nah he's actually Kaceytron. 




 yeh something like that, but if i remeber correctly it's due to the dominion pros practicing on that day or something, so you get paired with super good players xD
