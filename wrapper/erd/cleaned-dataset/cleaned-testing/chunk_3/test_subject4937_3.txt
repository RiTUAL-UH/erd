 agreed--but tanzania--lots of other great things to be found that actually are worth quite a bit. 




 It's a DOE lab. Expect the basics. But if you like to read, which can be hard without video or pictures, it's a great article. 









 This system that another oil company (Total) is actually even more powerful, although not by much. And remember, these are just the beasts people KNOW about. http://www.hpcwire.com/hpcwire/2012-02-14/sgi_to_deliver_2.3_petaflop_system_to_total_s.a..html 









 I guess I didn't realize that something directly from one of the major national labs was not going to be acceptable.  









 Agreed--Jasper Chert. Which by the way, just solved my problem of what to name a minor character is a story I'm working on. Thanks! 




 TACC is adamant in this article that it's NOT at all involved with the system itself--that the technology is distinct from any Dell involvement..not sure what is being hinted at. 




 That patent that's listed is one of three they have to their name. Seems to be the only one that connects to what TACC has going on. This blows top supercomputer IOPS out of the water... 









 Can you use a toothbrush to expose it a bit more and offer a pic with better lighting? 




 Fantastic fossil hunting. Some great Devonian (I think) era coral and shell matter. 




 Agree on the chert--where was this found?
 









 Hi--thank you! I feel silly, but what is this cakeday thing people talk about here? Is that an out of touch question (ha!) 




 Yes, my nail (with effort) will scratch it... 




 Hi there! Yes, I think I have found two different answers through /rockhounds. There is an ongoing fight (via someone else's similar specimen) that it is either barite or selenite. It is indeed very heavy for its size--translucent (slightly smoky) spires vertically oriented but with a few horizontal "bars" of yellowish running throughout. No blacklight here, sorry. 




 Hey, I didn't downvote you--I actually upvoted you...what the heck? ... I appreciate your help! 




 And the slinky wave is entertaining :) 




 I did a google search for selenite after seeing your comment about that below and it doesn't look like this either. Here is my specimen photo, similar to OP's - found in Denver, CO http://imgur.com/mm3dUCk  




 Incredible and beautifully displayed... 




 Thanks for adding this--why isn't this commonly given as a form, I wonder. Is it that it's an uncommon form do you think? 




 Hi, i am inclined to agree. I just posted a pic in /whatisthisrock of the exact same stuff--down to the yellowish stripe--that I found in Colorado recently. And agreed, doesn't look like barite as I see it elsewhere. I'll follow this thread closely to see what they tell you. 




 Can someone help me ID this? I have done some research, a few options but still not sure. Thank you! 









 Can you help me ID this? http://imgur.com/mm3dUCk 

Thanks, all! 



















 Google+, is that you? 

















































 Looks like a concretion...So yes, probably a natural sedimentary formation. These can be tricky because they often look  "purposeful"....neat find, lucky you on the arrowheads 




 Well, they've removed it in this offering--this is what makes the Flex system what it is but some people, from what I understand, decided that Flex was too locky for their tastes--they wanted to have flexibility on switching, mgmt, etc... There is an SDN feature here too but it's not been explained thoroughly--or maybe that's something that's coming soon (like the GPU, Phi, direct water, etc)... 




 If the server market numbers from IDC and others is any indication--people DO want these. The question is, would they want them from IBM when, as mentioned in the article, HP, Supermicro, Dell and others are going to stick it on the price (not to mention the flexibility--i.e. for now it's just Xeon E5) -- It's hard to see IBM competing in the "made in China" wars but this does seem to be where the server market itself is going--Open Compute-inspired, stripped down systems that are purpose-driven and free from the cumbersome crap (like Platform's workload mgr, etc--things included here)...

All server makers on the HPC side are confused. 














 Also--now pretty sure it's shale with the ripples. Did a fair bit of research--all signs point to this. But this thing isn't part of the ripple. Has the hard shiny (after wearing down) parts on the "bones" of it but not anywhere else. 




 I have something similar--it is shale and has lines in it from fossilized mud/ripples. It seems to break in odd places so sometimes it looks like something more interesting than it is. I have broken a few of mine, sanded others down, but only one appears to be really interesting/have something unique (in this case a foot/print). 




 I am not as smart as you--can you tell me how you're so certain so I can proceed better with my own research? Thanks! 




 I just uploaded some photos of other similar pieces I brought back from the same location (all in one area about 20 x 20 with nothing else like it around--I've looked repeatedly).

See here http://imgur.com/a/LH9zc 




 That looks about right... 




 Also, these came from the High Point area-- 




 Well, hello neighbor--I am in High Point. Found these in one giant patch of similar thick rocks with ripples and brought many of them home. They were in a MOST geologically strange location--crystals unlike I've seen a couple of (seriously) amethyst points. Never seen anything like it. 

These are not stromatolites for sure. Got a bunch of those already--these things are thick, like layers and layers of ancient mud. I will take a few photos in a little bit to give you a sense of what some of the others are with my tiny, tiny hands as scale (ha--seriously).

Love the Pteridinium but this thing would have to be many yards long and there's not enough regularity.

Pics coming in 10 minutes or so of some of my other hunks. Again--weird locale. Amethyst points (2), an emerald, and what appears to be citrine. Not sure what to think. 

Okay--off to photograph for you! 




 Thanks so much for taking the time and thought to send the link and ideas. I have a number of other pieces of this "fossilized mud" stuff that look somewhat similar to the pieces there, but they are VERY thick. Some of the pieces are 6-8 inches thick, others thicker. It looks like this (which I found after a long search for anything similar) http://getoffourplanet.com/?p=3603

The weird thing is, the "bones" in this are black and much harder than the surrounding rock. It is possible for me to clean around it and those remain. Afraid to do so until I know more.

To answer your question, there is no curvature to any of the chunks I have--the link above is almost exactly what this stuff looks like. Oddly enough, there isn't anything clearly visible that's fossilized in anything other than the deep ripples (which incidentally, when a big one broke, the ripples go all the way through--completely 3D).

I am so glad you sent that info. It helps me keep an eye for other exciting things in the vicinity! 
 




 I found a number of pieces of fossilized, dark mud in a riverbed in central north carolina. Surrounded by some of the most perfectly formed quartz points I've seen around here, to boot. Strange place... Most of the fossilized mud pieces are straight or slightly wavy lines. Light sanding tones them down. But under these "toes" or whatever they are it's black hard rock, different than what makes these up. Can anyone help me ID? I am new to this...
