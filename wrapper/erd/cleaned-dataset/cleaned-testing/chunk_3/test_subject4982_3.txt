 /r/popping  




 That's happened to me a few times, I have worked at the same Country Club for 6 years. Each time they get closer to me.  




 Wtf did I just read?  




 Left over blow- duh... 




 Hello neighbor!  




 Toledo, Ohio.  




 I want to have really intense, mind blowin sex in there then take pictures of the handprints. 

Is that weird?  




 You. Your man-bun. Your beard. 

Ever close to Ohio, let me know.  




 Your mike has a blackhead. Lol that's what I see atleast 




 If only.... 




 Quite clever  




 Idk that nipple tho.... 




 For this, I would have also. I'm losing my mind. 




 Pull be pregnant in a couple months.  




 Post this to /r/popping and take a look at some of the other Plantar Warts on there!  




 I think it's strangely hot. 




 Hairy bum. 




 Maybe that's why Gary meows in Spongbob 




 Cyst* and share this on /r/popping they would enjoy it.  




 I cannot find it, I dug for it.. 









 Thank you for delivering OP!  




 I've always used a bobby pin or an extractor. It helps to have someone help you with the ones in your ears. SOMEONE WITH A STEADY HAND. You DO NOT want someone to slip and rupture anything inside your ear. 

Happy popping!  




 I would love to see a picture of the bathroom. 

I'm a medium. I have spoken to the deceased for years, starting when I was about 6-7. (21/f) Not only that I'm an active member at our local paranormal group. People have brought me into their homes to try to figure out what was going on. 

You need to research the property, and surrounding areas land. You need to be sure that no one in the home has brought home any new items. 

Please be aware that even though you told this entity to leave does not mean it will not return. (I am not trying to scare you.) 

We like to say that sometimes spirits will go dormant. They do also cycle. Haunt at specific times of the year, things like that.

Please post pictures, I would love to see the dog also. 

Best of luck to you, and remember- we are never alone. We chose to see what we allow ourselves to.  




 I don't think that is harsh at all...any crime against a child is haneous.  




 Let's find these girls and slap them, too many people I know have does from Molly. She is not your friend.
