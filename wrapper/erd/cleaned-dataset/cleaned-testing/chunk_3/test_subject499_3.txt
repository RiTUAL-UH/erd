 I'm super excited for final book, as well. But haven't heard anything.

However, on the [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/City-Mirrors-Justin-Cronin/dp/0752897896/ref=sr_1_1?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1434363208 sr=1-1 keywords=city+of+mirrors) page for it, they seem to be standing on December 31st 2016 release date. 




 "Is your name winter? - 'Cause you'll be coming soon."

:) 




 Have to jump in and say how *vastly* superior *Morrowind* was to *Oblivion*. Morrowind was so, so good. Highly recommend. 




 thx 









 Yeah I think your right about that. I just don't think Bane was any kind of follow-up to the Joker. If Bane had come first it might have been a different story, the problem was that he had to follow Ledger's Joker. Nolan dug himself a hole with such a brilliant villain, and a great film. There was no way the third film could have competed against it.

Having said that TDKR is by all standards a decent film. And you have to respect the shit out of Nolan for actually ripping a plane to pieces, rather then hollywood-ising it and using CG. The rest of the film could have been shit (it wouldn't) but that remains one of the best opening scenes to a film ever. 




 For the masterpiece that was *The Dark Knight*?! Everyone needs to make time! :D 




 Thinking of buying a game at half price (Civ 5). Is there a guarantee the price won't drop at a later day in the sale?  




 Damn is it that time of year again. What a terrible time to lose my job :( 




 You watch the sequel? The Dark Knight Rises. Would be interested to see what you thought about that.

What compelled you into rewatching it? 




 It's hard to say without reading the previous Sapkowski novels, or playing the original 2 TES games. 3 if you never played Morrowind. 

Morrowind was an entire construction in it's own. They wrote novel after novel of information for that game, just to create backstory. The world has been growing since the very first TES game 'Arena'. For contemporary players - who perhaps joined at Oblivion, or even Skyrim, there might not be a lot to offer. 

Equally, people who only joined the game at The Wild Hunt might miss out on a lot of the world only gleamed through either the original novels, or the first two games. 

I think what settles this is where they came from. TES was never meant to be more than a game. The aim of its construction was, above all, to make a game that was as enjoyable as possible. It was built on the idea of *there's a goblin, here's a pointy thing.' And the world has been growing ever since.

Unfortunately, due to the polish origins (I don't speak Polish) and the fact I joined TES shortly after Morrowind's release, and the Witcher during the seconds 360 release, I don't know as much about The Witcher's backstory. However the depth of the world can be seen as thus; one is aimed at gamers. At the time of Arena's release this was a bunch of teenage boys. The Witcher however aimed immediately at a more adult market, went into the world darker and with a more likeable protagonist. (The world only shines as bright as it's protagonists). 

So if you want to compare each world as a whole, the political intrigue, character division, and depth of the beasts lends The Witcher strong marks. TES draws far too heavily on medieval England, and populates its world fairly predictably. I would have to go with The Witcher.

However if you were implying to only question the *game* worlds of Skyrim vs The Witcher continent as seen through their flagship games - you would have to go Witcher also. This is however an unfair question given the years between releases. 

Skyrim set out to do something fantastic, and it did. It remains one of the best fantasy RPG games of all time. It might still hold the mantle (DA:Inquisition turning into something of a colossal disappointment). And Wild Hunt has the technology (and brilliant studio) behind it to really push the boundaries of what they can do. The world is more alive and aesthetically stunning. Skyrim I felt was better to explore - you were more likely to come across something you wouldn't expect to. Whereas in the Witcher - Geralt's entire mode of life is to find and kill monsters, which takes a sheen off finding and killing monsters when you approach it with a calculated, almost contrived mindset. 

Having said that, I would much rather explore the world of The Witcher - not just for it's aesthetics, but for the people, the fantastic monsters, the quests that are more than just 'kill, x 10' (though those do exist).

So yeah, I didn't expect this to be so one-sided when I set out. I though I would back TES far more than this, but, hands down, The Witcher.

Having said that, let's see what Fallout 4 produces. Which will give us a neat idea of what the next installment in TES will be. Bethesda are one of the best studios going and I trust what they produce to be excellent.

Edit: Grammar 




 I'm sorry, I read the whole post but am still blindsided by the title.

This is only your second viewing. *Since 2008?*  




 Inside Out will change that! 




 Same as Cars 2. Though MU was better. Brave was a bit...naff also. 




 I loved MU too, I'm just not sure how well it fed into the first one. Or compared to it. 

 




 Up, man. UP is Pixar's best. Though they really do make some of the unparalleled best films of all time. 

I trust implicitly that Inside Out will be excellent. 




 I was a little bit later when Toy Story came out. 

But when Pixar surged - The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc, they were amazing.  




 The old Disney days were awesome.

But Disney cant compare to Pixar - not even a little bit.

UP. UP is just amazing.

But even that isn't as good as *How to Train Your Dragon 2*.

Favouritest bestest ever kids film. 




 I was pretty happy with my first rejection. It wasn't as if I had been expecting anything else. I wasn't disappointed (around the fourth that came in - then it got worse). It felt to me like I had done something. Taken a step towards my dream. Proved that I was capable of putting myself out there. 

It also meant another 6 months of editing but, hey, what ya gonna do?

Congrats is all I can say =] 




 Support for the previous consoles hasn't died out, or for PC. Why not get Fallout 3? And try it. It'll give you the best insight into whether or not you'll like Fallout 4. The stories won't interact, so no worries there, but you'll get a feel for the world and gameplay.

New Vegas wasn't made by Bethesda - but FO3 and FO4 are. Just to bear in mind. 




 It was a werewolf flick, but I didn't really have anything to write. I gave up.  




 Know what I'm doing tomorrow =] 




 Night, sleep well, stranger =] 




 :(

:((

:(((

(x3 sad, not double and triple chin - would perhaps looks like that if I ate them shortbreads though ;).)

Looking good, thanks for the sharing dem cooking skills =] 




 The thing about the niche is that right now it isn't niche enough, and I need to dig deeper. I'm happy to dive in as is (so long as my friend comes aboard), but I understand it might go a bit better with a bit more planning.  




 Not burnt yet, and looking **delicious**.

...

hungry 




 Half of convincing my friend is encouraging them to stick through the initial slow-phase. The first few months of barrenness, and hoping it pays off. 

I have an interesting niche in mind, but I'm not too sure how well it will work out. Just because it's YT, and there's a lot of stuff out there, and hundreds of people trying to *make it*. 

But thanks for the advice, I appreciate it. Anything advice right now is useful. 




 Never heard of that show. Sounds a bit Twilight Zone-y. 

Green tea is a sin. Any tea but normal tea is a sin against tea, and the British. Power to Tea! I just love tea. If I'm feeling particularly withdrawn from tea, and finally get a drink, I do love it in my stomach, all warm and snuggly =]

I've given up on the story now. Was just trying to write for the sake of it. I failed. 




 Share a picture when they're done. I want to see that delicious biscuity-goodness :D 




 *-wishes he could now eat shortbread.-* Thanks for taking time out of your baking to share with me, and make me crave shortbread biscuits whilst I'm all tucked up and cozy in bed. 




 The worst of it? We don't know why we actually need to sleep. We just do! Just 'cause. No reason we know of. Yep, wasting 1/3 of our day, every day. I dislike. 




 Gaming. Within the 'Lets Play' vein of videos. But with potential to break out into more versatile areas. 




 It's a matter of convincing my friend to put in the time and effort. Especially the beginning few months where, on the more exciting videos, we might break 100 views.  




 I'm doing quite well, thanks for asking. Starting to get a bit tired, now, but I can go on a bit longer. 




 Coming along then. Getting there, slowly. I always say a project is serious (or "Main") when it reaches 20k. 




 Interesting concept. What's the word count on it now? 




 I usually find myself like this. Happier to stay awake ridiculously late and have a decent lie-in in the morning. I'm more awake and more active this time of the evening/night.

What anime? How's your tea? (Tea: nectar of the gods). I'm working slowly on a story, but not a very good one. 




 Sounds like a good day. What was the project? 




 Three novels, hey? Interesting way to do it. Nothing wrong with a break, but what are your novel's about?

Yeah I'm a writer, I get interested in and like talking to other writers about the craft. 




 So long as you enjoy it, that's what it's all about.

Ever written anything longer? A novel? Am I distracting you now? Are you procrastinating, haha. 




 It's a good thing you wrote it in that order. Because even though it started out rough it's turning around and starting to work out in your favour. There's not a lot you can do right now except enjoy all the free-time you've suddenly got as a single man. That's what I did when I became single. Found new hobbies, read more, just spent more time to myself, and it was great. 




 We hiked through the Cairngorms and up the mountain. Visited more castles (and subsequently learned a shitload of Scottish history) than I thought possible to do in one week. And I also climbed Ben Nevis. So...yeah...been to the highest point in the UK. Whoo =] 




 I'm just sitting here thinking of my own ideas like - *damn, that's a good idea...my ideas are shit...*

I'm sure the mods won't, hopefully I won't miss it.  




 Sounds like a more exciting Wednesday evening than the one I'm having. 




 I like to keep myself going on here, never be wholly absent. Try and have a thread going now and then, so I'm not *just* lurking. I wanted to know what was happening on the internet and reddit - on the other hand, some damn beautiful views in Scotland. 




 Sounds like a fun challenge, albeit difficult. Good luck getting all those done.

Also...interesting concept. Does the reader know from the beginning he's going to visit his own grave? Or is that the twist?

If you remember me, show me the collection for free on Kindle I wouldn't mind taking a peek =] 




 Sounds awesome. Just kicking back, enjoying not having to sleep? 




 Reddit altogether. I went on a week-and-a-half hiking holiday to Scotland. Was pretty much away from the internet. And most technology (except phone and car). A week away from Reddit - it was hard, man. 




 What's kept you up so late? 




 A writer! What's the short about? Plan on doing anything with it? 




 I stay the hell away from creepy stuff. I watched the new 'Evil Dead', and my girlfriend succesfully bribed to watch 'Sinister' with her in cinema (for *Dishonored* - which was totally worth it). And yeah...I did not sleep for weeks after each one. Every time I stumble across something I think might be creepy I just turn it off - it's not worth it.

I'm good at the moment, just feeling alive, like I want to do something. So I thought I'd catch up with CC as I haven't been on in a while =] 




 A little undeveloped at the moment. Need to work on it, make it more watchable, try and evaluate if it would actually work. See if my friend - who I have ran the idea past - is as interested as they seem, or if they were just humouring me... 




 Gaming videos. Don't worry, I know a million of those exist already but I have my own little niche to bring to it.  




 Sounds good to me. 




 Anyone else ever just in the mood to stay up all night for the sake of it, yeah, I'm currently going through that. 

Current thought: I'm currently trying to devise a way to make money. A youtube channel is a good idea - but I need to convince my friend to do it with me, hmm.

Anyway, how are you? 




 Me and my then girlfriend were playing it. So got lost in the castle and our lantern went out. I gave up then.
 




 I don't know a single person who wouldn't take those odds. Ok, a few, perhaps. But being able to *choose* to fly, or run super-fast, etc. Who wouldn't? 




 Well, it wouldn't be surgerical. It's a hypothetical; the procedure takes place in whatever way you're comfortable with :).  




 Couple'a months... at the most.  




 So a question I came up with, that I like to ask people:

You have the choice to undergo a procedure to get superpowers. The chances of it working are slim, and, if it doesn't, you'll die horribly and slowly of radiation poisoning. So - is it worth the risk?

1) You don't get to choose the superpower. It could be anything. It could be great (super speeds, flying) it could be crap, like controlling cheese or something.


2) You can't kill yourself if the procedure fails. You have to suffer. That's the point.

Dying a slow and horrible death worth even the slightest possibility of gaining superpowers? Let me know. 




 I think I read a lot. Probably went a film-binge. Kept an eye on my emails, kept refreshing every 5 minutes. 

And, of course, got very, very drunk.  




 AH! This is so true. This book was so much more amazing than I thought. It truly is exceptional. Easily one of the best books I have ever read. 




 Just finished *Flowers for Algernon*, by Keyes. And just started *Smoke and Mirrors*, by Gaiman. 




 [Following this thread] 




 Promising review. 

How does the combat go? Feel? Is it unique or same as all the other MMO's? What are the classes like? 




 Let me know when you've given it a chance. I've sorta kept an eye on it, enough to hear it was almost definitely going F2P (and it did), but I've played enough MMO's to be skeptical. 




 How is it? Any good? Might give it a try. 




 I've read about it just, and what I've read isn't comforting. So I know it's not just me. It's a save game bug, where I can't save the game manually. When I jumped into the game this morning there were frame-rate issues, especially bad during combat, so I wanted to save and quit and reload and hope that worked. But now I'm scared to quit unless the game throws me back a few hours. Every solution to the issue seems to risk losing my entire save file and the hours I've put into the game already.

Anybody else ran into this issue? Apparently it's not just affecting the Xbone but PS4 and PC as well - though the PC fix seems easier and more likely to not mess up the game.

I mean, otherwise a really excellent game. Cheer me up, gamers =[ 




 Kvothe is one of, if not the, most compelling characters I've ever read. You haven't met Ambrose yet but when you do, you'll loathe him just because Kvothe does. When Kvothe doesn't succeed, I've never felt so bad for any character, nor wanted one to succeed just so much. Rothfuss does a brilliant job of making you sympathise with Kvothe on a really human level. And that is excellent.

But yeah, mostly he is an utter badass. 




 I cannot recommend you finish TNotW and TWMF ASAP! Two of the best books I've ever read. And I still really want to get round to the The Dresden Files but my backlog is heavy enough as it is. 

But yeah, de-prioritise everything else, read TKKC. That's my advice. 




 I didn't watch that one tbh. Too busy playing the Witcher. But the channel is really interesting. The first half of the video - which I watched - was really good. Check it out: [Clickity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNuQZPTHALI) 




 Not doing any reading? Throw in some reading there =] 




 [My life isn't very interesting](http://imgur.com/nnxXHrj) 




 Trying super hard to be objective. Why didn't you like it.

I also point out that I personally think Ocean is his best, some people prefer American Gods, others prefer Neverwhere.q 




 I wasn't implying to start using Unity, just they have a better community over there. I think earning attaining skills is the best way to go, just speaking from my own experiences trying to find a way into the industry. 




 Because I couldn't find the others. Don't want to join in on a dead thread. Start my own and cover new ground, rather than trek old ones. 




 There's enough to be going on with online. I know you want to work in UE but if you're working with one of the C's, of Java, the community over on the Unity site are super helpful. There are other programming sites, and even Reddit should be able to help with any niggling questions. If you push at it hard enough you can teach yourself to program.

What kind of design do you mean? 




 Biggest hurdle will be not having anything to offer.

Can you design, or draw or program? Perhaps an internship is the best way to go. The industry is so damn saturated these days that you need to be above the best to even be considered. 

UE4 is a great way to go, and learning on your own is rewarding. But difficult. Ridiculously difficult. I tried it. Programming is hard, and modelling is hard, and GUI and sprites and textures are hard.

It's a lengthy process but one of the most rewarding you'll ever do. Just gotta stick at it. 




 Ah, got it. Listening to it now thankyou.

I thought it was a BBC radio thing. Sounds awesome. 




 This game, though excellent, takes on a whole new perspective, and reaches unseen emotional heights, upon completion. You simply have to finish it. I just...the game - the story - isn't the same without the ending. It needs it. 




 To me his emotional growth was spearheaded by the *other charlie*, and that his own emotional growth was subdued, especially compared to his intellectual growth, by his traumatic childhood experiences. His emotional growth wouldn't have been so impeded were it not for his childhood trauma, and how it came to him so slowly, piece by piece so he could never come to terms with it in one go. That kept his emotional level at that of a child, far more than his intellectual growth. Emotionally he was at the point where he could sleep with Fay, but due to *other Charlie*, he couldn't sleep with Alice. 

I read the last fourty of thirty pages in one go, so I got pretty much the events leading up to his decline, and the decline itself in one go. When his sentences fell apart, and his spelling decline, that when it really hit me. Harder I thought than it was going to, because everyone saw that coming. It was just before the decline when he said he could never go back to being, as he put it, retarded. And then during his decline he said was much happier in his current state, that was what got me. 




 Where can I find it? 




 Hey, I didn't read the whole post because...spoilers. I just wanted to ask. How good was the audiobook? Cumberbatch a decent narrator? How long is it? I'm not overly fond of audiobooks, but I would make an exception. 

Thanks in advance, I've wanted to get round to this for ages, and this is a really good excuse for me to do so. 




 I felt a good takeaway from the book was actually about introversion. For a book about a super-genius it was about 100% more existential than I thought it would be. 

But yeah, particularly towards the end the book took a pretty dark turn, and it did bottle-neck the message into: stay stupid; stay happy. 

But the book was really only about Charlie, I didn't perceive it as an allegory for anything, I never read through it thinking there was a message it was trying to get across. It was a ride, and a good one. 




 I studied Media for five years, I have a degree in it. And damn didn't I spend four of those five years wishing I had studied gaming.

Kudos to you, I say. *Do something you love and you'll never work a day in your life.* 

How are you breaking into the industry? Are you just venturing out on your own making indie games? Or looking to break into a large studio? 




 You don't. You get to know them better. Then you're not uncomfortable anymore; you know them.
 




 Ya know I see a lot of these on CC. It always cheers me up seeing something like this and just knowing that a stranger, at least as far as I know, is doing well in life. That might be weird, but it's more cheerful than seeing the news. I just know that if I pop over to CC I will see at least 80% of the threads are cheerful and life-affirming. And the 20% that aren't, anyone who reads them almost always comments something positive. 

Thanks stranger, I'm happy your life is working out :) 




 It did seem to be a central theme that intelligence generally equaled unhappiness. Which was super-important in Charlie's case. I went in expecting it to kinda praise intelligence but it really didn't. I guess that's one of the reasons the book is so good. 




 I know there's been a lot of threads about this book, but I've avoided them for spoilers. Now I've finished it I want to hear what you thought of it.


**Spoilers will follow**

 




 First of all watch the film.

Second of all watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98j1Sb97usg). It will be a major help in understanding parts of the book. But it is spoiler-ific, which is why I recommend the film first. 

Once you've seen both I think then you'll be able to appreciate the book. I watched that YT video *after* I had read the book, and everything really just fell into place, with regards to the book. So I think it's worth watching first. 









 No. Only one. Christopher Nolan. 




 He just is. Perfect in every way. He doesn't make mistakes. He is the best.  




 All hail our lord and cinematic saviour Christopher Nolan. He is a god. 




 THis is absolutely beautiful. I'm super exciting, but ya know what annoys me? And The Witcher isn't the only culprit. 

It really annoys me when you get the game case *and a steelbook!* I mean, *of course* I want to use the steelbook but *the hell am I gunna do with this wasted *normal* *case?* Now I just have a spare case for the shits and giggles, damnit!

Didn't know it came with a cloth map though, very nice touch. 




 Awesome work. Very nice and effective.

Still annoyed they changed the acronym. I mean - talk about doing something just for the sake of it! 




 Got me as well, at first. Boy did I feel silly when Morgenstern wasn't real. 




 Witcher 3 




 What role were you doing?  




 Maybe The Last of Us. But, if I remember correctly, Far Cry 3's *Blood Dragon* was pretty good. It might just have been that the ending to that game was probably the best of any game I've played, really. 




 It's 10:40 AM in the morning and I woke up not so long ago. Chilling in bed reading. 




 American Gods is absolutely amazing. Of course it's not as good as The Ocean at the End of the Lane - which is his best. His short stories are also well worth a read. He has three collections and they are all brilliant. 




 Your friend just needs to stretch his gaming muscle.  




 Good bit of broth there =]

Hmm, Olive and Whale Blubber Broth. Dinner of kings. 

So if I ever get this game I will scour every coast for a beached whale now, to discover if this was a chance incident in your game, or implemented into every single one. Just how much can CDProjektRed impress me? 




 Ooh, do me. Do me! 




 Depends if you want to live-stream it via twitch or make a let's play YT channel.

As far as live-streaming go, there's really no reason not to stream live from the Xbone, it cuts out the middle-man (PC) and is just nifty and a lot more stream-lined, with faster streaming speeds, which means higher quality.

Capturing it is another story. There really isn't any way to do it other than with a capture card (heretofore called CC). CC's can cost a fair bit of money, but you do, of course, get what you pay for. Like I said mine was 100 but is one of the best on the market. Especially for the new generation, like the Xbox one. 

If you give me an idea of the kind of format you're going for - what you plan on doing. I can give you an idea of the best way to do it, if that helps. 

If I'd have stuck with it however my plan would have been to stream and LP both. Stream games that are more drop-in-drop-out. Games on COD, silly run-throughs, shorter, possibly indie, games. And then do YT LP's of the more serious plays, the story driven games, or the longer ones. I suppose the plan was to create a larger fan base, and, of course, play as many games as possible, and get the most from each one. 




 How's that 1 olive working out for you? :D 




 Live streaming from PC? *OBS*. Easy to use and connects straight to Twitch account. There is also *Xsplit* but that isn't as recommended. 

Of course Steam has its own streaming now, so you can use that.

From consoles? The new generation (Xbone, PS4) have twitch apps you can download and stream straight from console, all you need is internet and a mic. Kinect can also be used as a cam if you want (I assume PS Move can too). 

From older consoles? You might need a capture card. I own the *Game Capture HD*. The card itself cost me 100 quid, but the program to stream is free. Comes with all the necessary cables and works with every console I've tried it on, which is everything but the Wii U (though it does have issues with PS3). Also, it should work fine with the Wii U, I just haven't tested that one out yet. There are cheaper alternatives. 

Ah...I think that's everything covered. 

Of course then it comes down to production values. I have used a Guitar Hero Mic plugged into my laptop, and that worked fine, better than the built in one. But if you want to look pretty, I recommend a decent webcam and mic. They can be somewhat cheap, depends what you want. 

Editing is also super easy these days. But if you, again, want the professional sheen I recommend Final Cut Express. It's pretty much iMovie or Windows Movie Maker but a bit hyped up. It's approaching professionalism. A little bit more pristine is Final Cut X, but that'll set you back more than a bit. iMovie and WMM do the job fine, and to start out with, they're perfect.

As for content; that's down to you. There are plenty of guides out there. 




 Ooh that is painful too :( I feel for you, broken TV is not cool. 




 We can be sad together. 




 Yeah, I just ain't that good, m'afraid. I write for games though. Mind you, not a lot of money in that so far. 




 Man, that could be weeks. I was all set to pick it up tomorrow.
