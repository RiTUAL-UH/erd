 

[Okay this one is actually pretty funny](https://38.media.tumblr.com/62bd400d24d8a7d8974c43cfb31ad60b/tumblr_ngn95sPxYU1se5y46o1_1280.png) 




 How can something like that even exist? 




 What you said. 




 tell me what it is! 




 I don't even know anymore. 




 Okay what the actual fuck 




 what is this? 




 NSFW just in case

But yeah what is the most fucked up subreddit on here?

edit: Wow, I there certainly is some weird shit on here, everyone thank you for your comments and upvotes!

 














 I guess they are really saving Vision for the main event. 




 ARE THESE REAL OH PLEASE TAKE MY WHOLE FUCKING WALLET AAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHHHH GAAAAAAAHHH 




 That was just one of the things. Yes, I probably should've mentioned that other stuff instead of a bloody celebrity divorce.  




 Really? 




 [Here](http://www.ebay.com.au/sch/i.html?_odkw=drive+steelbook _from=R40 _osacat=0 _from=R40 _trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xdrive+novamedia.TRS0 _nkw=drive+novamedia _sacat=0)

They are not cheap! 




 Yes! FINALLY, same here!!!

The whole time I was thinking of Lancaster Dodd. 




 I'm mad at the fact that they can do something like that. I said 'how' they broke up their marriage, not 'that' they broke up their marriage. 




 Wow, you're judging my intelligence because I got an expression wrong....hmmmm okay. 




 Read my previous reply :) 




 Maybe I'm over-reacting a bit, and I normally take documentaries with a grain of sand, but this just really got to me. I just cannot believe what these bastards have gotten away with and how they treat their people. How they practically used people, such as Tom Cruise, to gain power and superiority. Also, how they basically destroyed his marriage to Nicole Kidman. Don't even get me started on that bastard Miscavige....

Like I said, how true can all this be? It seems pretty legit to me. I just wanted to see if anyone else feels the same way :) 









 this just puts mine to shame... 




 sorry all the photos are sideways 









 1. It (hmmmm bring me that remake)

2. The Stand

3. Bag of Bones

4. The Talisman

5. Pet Sematary 




 I feel the exact same way....about Spirited Away. 









 Has anyone heard anything? 




 I cannot remove the palm off my face... 




 Yeah the one I ordered from the UK was region B. Yeah I saw on eBay the ones from Japan were like $98!!! But yeah I was just wandering if they were actually releasing an Australian edition :) 




 I live in Australia, I just ordered the bluray out of the UK! Do you know if they are releasing it in Australia? 









 So you liked Spirited Away?

[This man](https://www.google.com.au/?gws_rd=ssl#q=hayao+miyazaki+movies) is a god, watch all of his films including the documentary they made about him recently.

Also, the [studio](https://www.google.com.au/?gws_rd=ssl#q=studio+ghibli+movies) he works for, watch all of their movies as well.  




 A Bioshock film. 




 Nightcrawler

Whiplash

Foxcatcher

Birdman 









 Killer Croc in Suicide Squad? Man this just keeps getting better and better.  




 Scene it. Pun intended. 









 I love Dredd, pity we won't be getting a sequel :/ 





























 At one point, you didn't know either. 




 what does TL:DR stand for? :P 









 Clint Eastwood hasn't directed a straight up comedy, not that I am aware of, so my guess is that it will be serious. 














 My respect for this man and his work just went through the fucking roof after my first viewing, I implore you to watch it. 









 Well I want to be a cinematographer, so really anything at all will do :) 









 Thank you very much 




 **I posted something similar to this on r/cinematography, but only few people could help me** 

I just wanted to see if you guys had some more/better recommendations. Any book to do with the art of visual storytelling or cinematography will be much appreciated. Thanks! 




 "You could land a jumbo fuckin jet in there!" 









 I am speechless. Your sir, deserve an award. 









 Watch 127 hourse.

James Franco KNOCKS IT OUT OF THE PARK. 




 I think this will be great.

The director clearly understands the character, as seen with that awesome test footage. 









 So I should? 




 Should I tag for NSFW? 









 What the fuck is going on here? 




 The work of Cujo... 




 [Very Naice!](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1979623485/borat.jpg) 









 [Very Nice](http://cdn.meme.am/instances/400x/11518290.jpg)

 




 Mr Brando himself. 









 Any books that would be good for someone learning about cinematography. Much appreciated! 




 I came here expecting everyone to be hating on it, I was pleasantly surprised. 




 Ha! 




 Fuck me. Source Code, End of Watch, Enemy, Prisoners, Nightcrawler and now this. Gyllenhaal's career is going the roof. 




 i'll check it out 




 wow, thanks a lot for that. 









 why all the downvotes? :/ 




 Marvel movies are my thing...

In a nutshell, I think recently with The Winter Soldier, marvel movies are becoming more cinematic. I think this is happening with AoU as well.

Read the link I sent the other guy. 




 I probably should've gone into a little more detail, but yeah that's exactly what I mean. 




 I shall. 




 What I mean is I didn't feel that the first one had the characteristics of a film, it didn't present itself as a MOVIE. I know that sound ridiculous and I probably will be downvoted but it's just how I feel. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED The Avengers, but throughout my life I wanted to see the characters that I grew up with put into a motion picture. Unfortunately, It just felt like an entertaining but shallow action film. I wanted more, I wanted a more 'cinematic' feel and look to it, and now I think that Joss Whedon has implemented this 'feel' into AoU, just judging by the 3 trailers. You get me

Edit: http://redd.it/2gxnax 

This guy knows what I am talking about, haha I just found this. 









 One of my biggest gripes with the first Avengers is that is wasn't cinematic enough. To me, it just didn't have that feel. From what I've seen as far as trailers go, I think the film has a much more 'cinematic' vibe to it. I can't say for sure, as I have not seen it yet. I hope it does turn out to be like that, as I believe that's how superhero movies SHOULD feel. Anyone else feel the same way? I would love the discuss this further. :) 




 So happy to hear that. I've actaully played a little bit of unity, the combat was great, as were the costumes, weapon selection and world design. I think it's worth getting just for those things alone. I've heard bad things about the missions and the story and lots of bugs. 




 I understand what it is like to lose someone close to you. That feeling of dread as the day they passed away on comes around. I've heard mixed things about Unity, I was thinking of giving it a chance as well. I hope you make it through the next week okay, like I said, PM me whenever. I will listen to anything you have to say. 




 Totally, talk to to me about anything. I used to play PC, my rig was soooo shit (i played on intel HD graphics). I played games like far cry 2 (one of my all time favs), skyrim, mark of the ninja, counter strike, the first assassins creed( again one of my favs). just games like that really, buuuuut i recently got a PS4, what an upgrade right? It's been great, i've just loaded up on games like gta 5, AC black flag, watch dogs and far cry 4. some of them are a little too disturbing for my taste (watch dogs) by i enjoyed all of them.

when you do finish work and go to the gamestore etc just have a think about the things we've been talking about previously, that should help a little.  




 Nice to hear! It feels good to be helping a person out like this, i am soo glad you are actually determined about making a change. Huskys are beautiful creatures. I never mentioned, i loved video games as well, feel free to talk to me about them. If your co workers are like that then yeah I do understand your situation, at least you have your cousin, family can be friends as well. Insurgent? not bad at all. summer (in america) is coming up so that's when all the awesome movies come out, like i cannot wait for Avengers age of ultron. 

If you don't mind, every few days i would like to PM you just to see how you are doing. 




 I am so happy that this is getting you to think. Please tell me what you want to do after your shift. Dogs are great, I recommend you look into that.

As for your coworkers, I see the problem. I think you can still form friendships among them, even if your interests are different. You strike up small talk and just go from there. Are they friendly? I find that talking about recent news, world events etc works a lot of the time, as most people are interested in these things.

Most of all I think you need time to yourself. I mean like taking a day off work as I mentioned or doing alternative things after work like going to the park, beach etc these things can help more than you think; just some peaceful time for self reflection. If you do end up watching the films I recommended please tell me what you think of them and if they impacted/affected you in any way. 




 Hmmmm yeah you really need to watch those movies I recommended. Fight Club changed me as a person, as did American Beauty, as both of the main characters in those films were just like me a few years ago and little bit like you too. If I changed, I believe you can too.

You said you have a full time job. Why not start looking for friends there? Or maybe a girlfriend. 

As for the drive home, eat dinner, bed at 10 thing, you really need to change that, as I can see that's part of what's dragging you down. Who told you that you HAVE to go to bed at 10? Who ever said you HAVE to go to work? Or even come home from work? Just take the day off one day, go to the park or beach or movies, just have a day to yourself. Pick a sunny, BEAUTIFUL day. Also, how about a pet? Dogs can be best, BEST friends. They can cheer you up, you can take them for walk, talk to them etc. You don't have to do the exact same crap everyday, no one ever said you did. We were put on this earth to live, you feel the emotions embedded in us, not be prisoners unto ourselves, and not to waste away our days. Is that how you want to remember your life? Doing the same things everyday? 




 I just re-read your post, I apologize for talking so much about myself; I feel like a dick. Here's me all Mr self-improved talking about my life and my happiness. I really do want to help you, I know that feeling, that feeling of just withering away slowly.  




 I know exactly how you feel. 

I used to be like you.

I recommend you watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipe6CMvW0Dg)

I keep happy using these 3 principles:

**1. (The most important IMO) Lotsa good movies, books, music and T.v shows**

That's right. I mentally deteriorate if I don't get good entertainment. It's important to me, it is what I value. I try to go to the movies as often as possible and I collect blurays and try to watch a movie a day. I also listen to a wide variety of music. Good music, not shit. This includes Elton John, Pink Floyd, ELO, Queen, David Bowie etc. Good books do the job as well. I LOVE Stephen King and I LOVE batman comics. That's just me. It's things like this that make us human.

**2. FRIENDS!**

You NEED people to talk to, it is an absolute necessity. And remember, it's QUALITY not QUANTITY. I have a medium-ish circle of friends who I am all close to, and they love me and I love them! If you are having a shitty day then you can ALWAYS talk to a friend about it, they will always listen, and that can help more than you may think.

**3 AN ESTABLISHED WAY OF SEEING THE WORLD THAT ISN'T NEGATIVE**

You need to know where are are and what you are. That may sound stupid, but you need to embrace everything. You are a living organism. We were not created by a superhuman being or whatever, unfortunately we won't find out until the day we die. But until that day we need to LIVE. Don't waste away your time, you are a human being for christ sake!! MAKE YOUR MARK ON THIS EARTH, you will only live once!! You need to have your own way of seeing things that isn't overly pessimistic or optimistic. I am a little bit in between. Also, try not to worry to much. I know a few people who let things like world hunger, poverty, terrorist attacks etc get to them, and I can see how much it drags them down. Don't let that terrible stuff get in your way!!! The way I see it, it's all background noise, unless it comes to me, which it never does.

Anyway, enough about me. Tell me about you. I really do want to help you out, and I will try my best.

Also, watch the following films (they helped me):

American Beauty (1999)

Birdman (2014)

Fight Club (1999) 

Silver Linings Playbook (2012)

Hope this helped, please respond!! 



 









 I misunderstood what you were saying when you said that it reminded you of the painter. I thought it was a condescending insult.

So what if people circlejerk? As soon as a talented director, actor etc starts being praised by a number of people they just accuse them of circlejerking.  




 I would genuinely find that interesting, thank you. 

So your comparing my drawing (which was a VERY quick sketch btw) to that of a down syndrome painter?

Also, why did you tell me to shut up in the first place? Do people discussing cinematography usually piss you off? 




 I love SoS, have you heard the Alchemy Live version? It's like the original except on steroids. 




 ??? 




 If I made a list, that film would be on it alright. 




 This is actually making me laugh. Come one dude, you started this, and to be honest I don't want this to go on any further. 

Also, would a 9 or 10 year old draw inspiration from artists such as Tim Burton and Ralph Steadman to draw a character from a **PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON FILM?**  




 I've just been looking through your profile. How old are you? 




 Apocalypse Now, The Godfather I   II, The Last Emporer and The Conformist are fucking amazing. 









 I see what you mean.  




 *reincarnation 




 As is Skyfall and most of Deakins' other films, including Unbroken. 




 Also, which ones do you think match a film **perfectly**? 




 His upcoming film the revenant, may just be it.
I don't see any oscar caliber perfomances in the months to come, but what can I say? I haven't seen all the films this year but the only oscar territory perfomances I can see coming up so far are Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs and Leo as Hugh Glass in 'The Revenant' (did you see the image they release of him!? JESUS he looks intense) 




 Range? That's ok, I understand what you mean. 

But if you want to see range from him just watch What's Eating Gilbert Grape. 




 2007.

No Country for Old Men 

Zodiac

There Will be blood

And countless others, I would be here forever. 




 We got Drive in 2011... 




 Why's that?
 




 He's just cruisin' along. 




 Personally, I enjoyed the first. The second? Not so much. To me the second volume was Von Trier's typical pessimistic style of film making and to a degree the first volume as well. But the ending to the 2nd volume really bothered me. As I stated before, It is a very pessimistic film. You are basically watching a character on a downward spiral, but the 2nd volume just went full Von Trier-hate the world mode, and I did not appreciate it.

Back to the first volume. Like I said, I genuinely enjoyed the first film. Although I would not watch it again, it was probably the most realistic you can get when covering that subject matter, and it didn't go over the top with it. Now you're probably think to yourself 'well, yes it did. Just look at the sex scenes!'. But the thing is, like I said, this is the most **realistic** take on this subject matter as you can get. And so while the graphic and sometimes unwatchable sex scenes are pretty intense, they are not over the top and gratuitous; they are simply realistic.

Anyway, that's my thoughts on the film. Please don't downvote! There is no need to as these are just my opinions. Yes I know my grammar is all over the place; I am not much of a writer.
I would love to here your thoughts on the films, like I said, please don't downvote if you disagree just post your argument in the comments and I will be happy to discuss :) 




 thank you for that...
 




 I know :'( 




  Michael Keaton in Birdman or The Unex- no 














 Interstellar

Moon

Interstellar

Moon 




 State of Play I thought was underrated. 




 *Extinction.  




 Yes, this will dominate the oscars. 




 Given the fact that Skyfall was one of the best Bonds in recent memory, how do you think they will top it? 

I would love to hear your skepticism or excitement for this film!

edit: why am I being downvoted? 




 Is that a Dark Knight reference? 




 For what purpose did he sacrifice everything to become a whistleblower? 




 Please keep this EXTREMELY basic but please do include specific examples. Thanks! 




 The Revenant may be it... 














 Ohhh I thought it was the complete opposite
 




 Yes I have
