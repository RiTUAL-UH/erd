 Ha I haven't either but considering I cry during half of Modern Family's episodes I'm sure I'd bawl. I get teary eyed pretty easily.  




 It's not silly. Without context, "Don't Mess with Texas" sounds just like that when you aren't directly exposed to the message of the motto.  




 Life of Joseph W. McVay as others have said but also check out Guerilla Maab 'Rise' - it's one of my favorite hip hop albums. Guerilla Maab was the 'rap group' he was in with Trae (the Truth) and their cousin Dougie D (currently serving life in prison I belive) before they both went solo. 




 OK that's what I figured you were saying. And I agree, we can't lose to Portugal, a tie wouldn't be ideal but at least we'd have the goal differential buffer for our game against Germany while they'd still have to beat Ghana (assuming Ghana loses to Germany). 




 Clarification, you're saying we will only be competing with Portugal to get out of the group stage, or we aren't going to be competing with Ghana because they're going to get out of the group stage for sure? 




 I don't really see how this is even a discussion. Unless for some reason he thinks we can compete with Germany for the 1 seed? Ideal outcome for the weekend - Germany wins vs. Ghana, US wins vs. Portugal. That gives both the US and Germany 6 points putting both teams through. If Ghana beats Germany and we beat Portugal then, like you said, there are 3 teams vying for 2 spots in the last game instead of 2 teams in (assuming US and Germany W). 




 Better to have 49 quarters than 2 quarters. 
 




 I don't really see how that would be all that beneficial. The more intersecting thoroughfares you have, the more 4-way stops and stop lights you need - this is bad.

I think the solution will be more 'science' than 'structure'. Mandated staggered business hours to lighten the rush that is rush hour, better light timing, emphasis on, implantation of and general acceptance and use of quality mass transit, better pedestrian options, better driving culture, the rise of driverless cars, etc.

Many small, subtle changes can add up to very noticeable gains. 

 Of course, it would require us to sacrifice certain quaint values about quiet, empty suburban streets, but oh well. This is Houston. The city proper. If you want quiet suburban streets, move to Katy.

And no, I don't want to sacrifice the small amount of pedestrian friendly areas for something that there is no basis or evidence that it works. (unless there is which I'd be interested in reading)

Buy up houses that are in the way via eminent domain, bulldoze them, and build connections in there place. This would help immensely with traffic at a fraction of the price of building new highways.

Easy to say until your house is on the chopping block. Also, this would not be cheap. Imminent domain acquisition is expensive and time consuming. Roads aren't cheap. Bridges aren't cheap. Restructuring intersections (where do we add stop lights? where do we add stop signs? where do we create 4 way stops?) to take on the added weight of new thoroughfare traffic can't be easy.

Melisandre and Davos? 




 Since when is it not OK to cry when you watch The Notebook? Thought that was a requirement. 




 It's hard ya know. Rockets were probably the second most criticized franchise this past season, with these same types of comments appear 
over and over. Rockets fans are human and sometimes it gets to us. I try not to let it get to me but I'll be honest, sometimes it does and sometimes I miss when the Rockets were everyone's favorite little team a couple seasons ago. 

I guess that's what happens when you acquire devisive superstars.  




 For when your primary logo gets injured. 




 There goes my 20 bucks. Thanks a lot Rocket's design team. 




 you tell 'em patty!

 Not really, it was where he tried, and failed, to return to power after being exiled from France. Attempting to invade Russia is what effed up Napolean's conquest of Europe.
 




 Friends who want to see you cream or ice cream; choose one. 




 The Guardian is the OG. 




 annnnnnd he's gone 




 Yeah but quality chocolate sprinkles make mediocre ice cream better. 




 I heard they're working on their fusion dance. Hopefully it's ready by the start of the season. 




 Schaub didn't until last year either. 10 interceptions returned for touchdowns confirmed.

Fitzmagic: "now we're driving, now they're driving" 




 That was the joke. 




 We've got the Summer Olympics for that, as well as when the Heat play the Spurs in the NBA Finals.

(but I know what you mean) 




 A couple decades was the amount of time it took to go from the first production of the V2 rocket to the first man in orbit. 20 years is a long time. Obviously dominoes need to fall in place: the right people have to be born; and the right system has to be in place with the support of mentors, coaches, facilities and culture. To act like it's unfeasible is just pessimistic shortsightedness. Obviously it's arrogance to think that it *will happen* because *America*, but it's nothing more than optimism to hope for it to happen.

 I like how the website is smh.

 I think he started loving Houston before HOuston started loving him, that's the thing. He's always repped Houston. He considers himself primarily mentored by Houston rappers. He threw a freaking week of appreciation for the city.

Yah, I can get down with Drake. Anyone who recognizes the greatness of Houston who isn't from here is a good dude in my book. 




 Why? He's from Canada, but has a tattoo representing his love for the city. He reps us hard. He considers us his second home. He loves Houston and considers himself a "Houston-mentored rapper". You should love the fact that someone with the pull of Drake reps so hard for a town he has no roots in. He gives us more national exposure than most of our homegrown guys (Bun B excluded - DJ Screw is legend status but outside of Houston and HH he is non-existent - Mike Jones was a cruel joke - Z-Ro, KeKe, ESG, wreckshop family, etc. all have in-state pull but that's about it).

Happy Delayed Drake Day! 




 He still graduated high school. It's on his transcript. They just aren't giving him the piece of paper that says he's a graduate of their school, but he is. A job/internship/school isn't going to ask to see your diploma ever.  




 I think FIFA has 3-4 backup countries that can host on the fly. USA, England, Germany, maybe France. It's a lot more than just stadiums.  




 my mom's a fat whore but she isn't that fat of a whore. 




 that was fun! 




 My go to is Knob Creek. At bars I'll either go for Knob Creek or Bulleit if they have neither I'll go to Makers. 

Bulleit Rye is also really good. Kind of a middle ground between bourbon and scotch. 




 How? 




 Atenas, alajuela  




 How are they basically indentured servants or serfs? 




 Oh Jesus fucking Christ. The dark ages? Reddit takes hyperbole to a whole other level. In my experience, the restaurant experience in the US is better than most "enlightened" countries. 




 You got 20 in metric, in imperial it's closer to 4.
 




 :p truth

 




 Nah no typo. Just rains more during rainy season but rains year round.  




 Nah, it really only rains for an hour max every day. Rest of the time it's blue skies and white clouds. So basically really concentrated verse England just being gloomy and wetish all the time. 

Really great weather. I actually lived in the town Nat Geo claimed best weather in the world in like 1990 or something.  




 You can get a refurbished by Nintendo console + pad + game for $200. 




 I was talking about Central America :D

lived in Costa Rice for a year

 I think I was being sarcastic. I think. 




 I don't really support it; I can't support it seeing as how I'm not a constituent of Louisiana. I'm just trying to rationalize it. Every issue deserves more than one point of view. It's important to see something you don't agree with and try to rationalize it without your opinions in view.

But I'm a bitch and a fool so what do I know. 




 with 16 what? 




 It's not a shock if you ever lived there. There are two seasons, rainy season and non-rainy season. It rains every day during non-rainy season.

It's nice rain though, usually in the afternoon, usually pretty hard for maybe an hour or so.

Laying under your tin roof during one of those rain storms is just the perfect nap time. Then the sun comes out, and the weather is perfect the rest of the time. 




 Which is odd because I'm pretty sure Mexico took the obesity crown from us a few years ago. 




 What's the irony?
 




 There's a hilarious bit in the new HBO show Silicon Valley, centered around Burger King and Cicadas. Highly recommend the show. 




 Mine was off by default. I also rarely see spotify updates from other people on Facebook, so I'm guessing that's true across the board.  




 There's a check box in preferences "update Facebook timeline when new music plays", it's not difficult to figure out.  




 The height of ignorance.  




 I fucking dare you to actually read the bill and not base your response off of a title/horribly editorialized article. 

C'mon bitch, I dare you. Do it.  




 Maybe in response to the bonanza of 'loss of income' claims levied after deep water, which BP was pretty much just accepting without any actual trial. This concentrates the judicial power of the state into one entity. Now the small municipality who sees a cash cow can't just file a lawsuit and pad it's pockets.

I think the bit about any monies received must be used for wetlands protection supports this.

Anyways, truth probably lies somewhere in the middle and once again a lot of people are gonna be wholly misinformed because OP is wholly misinformed.  




 But it's not good.  




 maybe the 25th and 2 second rounders. No way Morey trades 3 first round picks. 




 I think Rondo is 2nd on Morey's want list after Love.

Go for Love, if you can't get Love swing a deal for Rondo. 




 Would Lin be a bench player on the Knicks? Would Asik?

I can't see Lin coming off the bench and Asik versus Chandler would be an interesting position battle. 




 Dwight made 10 other dude's change teams because he was scared of the bright lights of LA. What a jerk. 




 stop socializing with me bro 




 How so?

 Can't you hide all notifications from certain apps? I remember doing that with Farmville way back in the day. 




 I love the social aspect of Spotify. Seeing what your friends are listening to in the desktop app, being able to share music easily, etc. 




 It's off by default I'm pretty sure. I never turned mine off and it isn't activated. 




 You know you can turn that off, right? 




 I never said they're the best just that they have the highest top speed. 




 I'm dumb dude, you said so yourself. How could you expect a coherent sentence?
 




 Cool. Good thing it was posted today too cuz I missed it yesterday. 




 You pegged me bro. I'm *that* dumb. I now to your obvious overwhelming intelligence.  




 The lighter characters have the lowest top speed though. 




 I mean, I get that, but like, being official is pretty important for a lot of things. 




 That's his point?

Klinnsman was hired on his credentials. Klinnsman slams Kobe for being extended on his credentials. Wilbon slams Klinnsman for hypocrisy.  




 That was his point though. He got a contract to be coach based on his past actions, then he went and criticized Kobe Bryant for getting a contract based on his past actions.

He conveyed the point with absolutely no tact but I think that was what he was saying. 




 Michael Wilbon is a sports writer too. 




 He's an American but he isn't a citizen?  




 If you're not first, you're last. 




 They were tied, Ronaldo scored shortly after this in stoppage time.

Then he got fired.

Worth it? 




 Be worse at FIFA bro 




 If I remember correctly Ronaldo promptly scored after this. Pretty sure it was in stoppage time or close to 90 minutes.

So no, probably not worth it. They lost, he lost his job, he probably fired up Ronaldo which resulted in the goal.

Ivan the Idiot. 




 Jesus shut the fuck up. Pedophilia charges? Lol. She is most likely 18 and even if she was 17 it would still be legal in the state of Texas.

Learn to not be dumb. 









 She is probably my least favorite casting on the show so far. I think the actress who played Ros would have been absolutely perfect for Shae and would have been a much better match personality wise with Tyrion. In that universe I wouldn't mind her taking the place of Penny. Gonna be interesting casting Penny though, are there any female dwarf actresses? 




 Huh. I'm sorry, were you expecting resolution in book 5 of, a minimum, 7 book series? 




 Fair enough. Sorry for making you read my faggotry. 




 "I don't spend..."

I probably spend an hour a day on the internet these days.

 




 Smurflogik, internet historian. 




 i did make an edit to amend my comment to not include smurflogik.

i could go into a majority of comment sections for posts on the front page, paste that onto one of the repost comments and it would be relevant. 




 Cool, did you like your new house? 




 you have an exceptional memory, i must admit 




 yeah see edit 




 How do you remember the exact year you saw that? You sure it wasn't 2002 or 2006? 




 See man, that's what you people just don't fucking get. I don't spend 15 hours a day on the internet but I see my fair share, and I've managed to never see this. You might have seen it 15 times, but this was my first.

Sometimes shit just slips through the cracks and you miss something. The simple enormity of the internet and all the content within is impossible for a single person to completely digest in *their lifetime* let alone the relative short amount of time that the internet has been churning out this content.

With that in mind, try to visualize all the stuff that you see for the first time that someone else has seen 15 times. Imagine trying to talk about it and the conversation revolves around the fact that it's "*a fuckin repost man*"

It's annoying. If you have seen something a billion times, what force drives you to go into the comments to let people know that you've seen it before?

I just picture you people in the real world, listening to someone tell a story that you'd already heard before.

"So there I was, sitting on the bench minding my own business when out of nowhe..."

"Dude, wtf, repost! you told this story already."

"Oh ya I did tell you! Sorry mate, but Patricia here hasn't heard it so I'm gonna keep going."

"Fuck Patricia, provide new content and stop being such a story whore"

"Fine... So there I was, sitting on the camel, minding my own busine..."

Patricia speaks up, "I've heard this, one stop telling it!"

e: i mean you're pretty chill about it but damn it's annoying when people act like they're above the repost

 




 Yeah when I was talking about vicinity to the light rail I meant Midtown. I do walk from the rail to my apt in montrose (Westheimer and Montrose abouts) every day after work and I don't think it's far (though it's starting to turn into a sweaty walk). I walk wayyyyy more than the average Houstonian to be fair.

There are a few bus routes that will take you there a lot quicker but I prefer the walk after work; gets my blood pumping a little. 




 Midtown sounds ideal, shouldn't be too difficult to find a place for $1,000, though might be a little more for the "perfect" spot. There are plenty of places that are pet friendly, but be prepared to pay an extra deposit for large breed. Midtown's population is predominantly young business types between 24-35, has quality night life, is about as central as you can get, it's close to downtown and the light rail (though fairly limited use depending on where your office is located).

Might also want to check out Montrose, there's a ton of large complexes going up and being finished right now. Montrose is just south of Midtown for an idea of the area.

The place you have in your post is pretty much right in between the two (Saint Danes is a great bar if you end up there - only a couple blocks away - and they're dog friendly). 




 Spirited Away is playing at River Oaks Theater, Friday and Saturday starting about midnight. 




 Natural flavors: strawberries, chocolate, lemons, grass, rocks, etc. etc.
 




 /r/im14andohnowigetit 




 That was much closer in history than a hundred years ago. Our average precipitation is still 48" and we average over 100 days of rainfall per year.

The past 4-5 years of dry have jogged the memory a bit I think.
 




 I'll tell someone I like their new Nikes - like Mikes - though that is traditionally reserved for 'street/urban shoes' such as AF1s, Air Max's, Dunks, etc. etc.. But for the most part yeah it's Nike like Mikey.

Nikes like Mikes is pretty much only for sneakerhead type shoes. 









 Sorry but that HEB is not only a better grocery store, but also a much better looking building and space. Love that they kept the big oak tree up in the parking lot. The high rise that's going up where fiesta once stood... now that is another matter.

Not really sure what would satisfy you if you can't find a bar in montrose that caters to your type of people. Yuppie bars, bro bars, hipster bars, gay bars, dive bars, cocktail bars, etc. etc., pick your poison. Also still an abundance of smaller retail outlets (which are seemingly popping up faster than your chains).

 




 But that's only because it's big... Per capita is not an important metric when talking about immigration. You can't say, "if Germany had the same population as the US, it's immigration numbers would reflect that increase".
