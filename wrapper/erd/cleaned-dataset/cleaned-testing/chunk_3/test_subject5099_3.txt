 The ability to turn all sounds except player sounds may or may not effect UHC, probably will be fine due to the fact that all people have access to it in vanilla at any time, and it is intended, but idk. 




 TBH, with their rarity, it seems fine, if you get that lucky to get one of these books, or spend the time to, then its about as balanced as spawning next to a temple, not game ending, but good. Considering too the drop of books in dungeons, it seems okay. 




 No more endurance?
 




 This is not the way to format posts, the correct format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (Title) and you must use UTC time.

 You sir, should just stop posting matches, this is ridiculous.
  




 Isn't Blitz FFA you start at half a heart but you have a notch apple? 




 I would move to a much more convenient position to bow fight, hopefully catching the attacker off-guard and shooting him to death. 




 I have to thank you for that, while it wasn't directly my intent, you gave the chat a more of a wake up call then myself alone could have. 




 The UHCS skype chat, as I understand it, is for us to socialize, and it has been that way for a while, but or some reason lately it is filled with uninteresting, stupid guff that most people don't want to read or care about. Myself and many others have left the chat for this reason, where we were mostly there for information about the server, the occasional conversation was fine, but it had gotten out of hand.

A long time ago when the server was smaller and there were way less people, me and MG had a very long conversation about random stuff, that we were promptly told by many to stop, which we did, and talked in a private chat.

What I'm asking is to stop all this random stuff on the chat, and bring it back to its original purpose, the way it should be and was meant to be, not some role-playing chat with random topics that mean nothing to the chat. This is a plea for order, for the way things should be, not a spam-filled chat with things you can do elsewhere. 




 I didnt say it wasn't :P just that he said call, but calls are not permitted. 




 *cough* skype is not allowed *cough* only teamspeak *cough cough* 




 basically, teamspeak would be incredibly easier because you can just switch channels. 




 The Title format MMM DD HH:MM UTC - Title and the time must be on a 24 hour clock, and the post must be made at least one hour in advance. 




 The Title format MMM DD HH:MM UTC - Title and the time must be on a 24 hour clock 




 The Title format MMM DD HH:MM UTC - Title and the time must be on a 24 hour clock, but a great idea none the less! 




 So you said you will open at 21:30, but you opened 5 minutes before that... Why? 




 I can't seem to resolve hostname. 




 The Announcement flair is for moderators only, change it... 




 He put the whitelist up when it was filled, it was filled in half a second.

 This post is still here though...
 




 Hey, could you remember to close your server or put up the whitelist next time, your spawn is a bit screwed up. 




 GAH 




 You could literally make an alliance of the entire server. 




 cough cough, You need to turn off whitelist, cough cough

 First of all, your title should be in the format of MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (Information), Secondly, you should be using UTC time, not GMT, which are the same, but UTC is used here. Thirdly, the only information you have is the gametype, time, and the nether, no subrules or other paraphernalia. Please look at other posts and follow the format next time. Also, you cannot post a match less than an hour before the actual match.

 I WILL TRY HARDER. 




 Wait, what? 




 THE VERY FIRST GAME THAT THE NETHER IS BACK, YOU HOST AT A TIME I CAN'T PLAY. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY 




 :/ 




 woo
 




 Damn guy punted me off a mountain for it though :D 




 Okay, I see, I see, I am aware too that for some reason your name was not there before, but congrats on freedom. 




 Allies cannot win together, they must kill in the end. 




 You are still on the UBL Slutty, Number 10. 




 Resource packs in general work fine with optifine, why wouldn't an xray one work? Just common logic... 




 ;_; 




 not that I'm trying to condone this or anything, or attack you, but there are xray texture packs too, which are obviously bannable, but they work with optifine...

DON'T DO IT KIDS, not even once... 




 You hosted my very first ever game, I am so sad to see you go :(
Hopefully you will do well in life, and I hope nothing horrible caused this.
...see you next time :) 




 test_subject5099, Swyrnd, Jaewoook 




 server not up? 




 because the game is tomorrow... -_- 




 Match posts must be made one hour or more in advance... 




 Not to be mean, but don't forget, if you're on the UBL, you also cannot be on the server. 




 Click the link... 




 :') I'm sure we will all miss you del, have a great time at college, the dragon rush I played with you was one of the most memorable games I ever played, and UHCS was (and is) a big deal to me :) good luck out there!

...and come back for a visit...ya hear? 




 This is true ^^^^ 




 ._. 




 No, log on at any time to play. 




 I wouldn't assume solos are allowed, are they? 




 Since this is the only activity this account has also ever had on reddit, this is almost certainly not true. Hooray for logic! 




 I win 




 Well, then allow me to go for round 3 :D 




 I posted this after the match was full, I posted it for people that didn't get into this match but still wanted to get in, but that's fine, I hate fun too. 




 You disable glowie yet? 




 Anyone that would still like to play a uhc, there is a voted match at uhc.msarchet.com:25618 




 It filled in half a second.
