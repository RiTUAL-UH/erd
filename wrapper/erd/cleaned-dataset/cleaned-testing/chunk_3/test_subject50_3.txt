 Not exactly. UV-A refers to UV closer to the blue spectrum while UV-B refers to wavelengths slightly shorter than the ones considered UV-A and UV-C is in between UV-B and X-ray I believe...wikipedia...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet#Subtypes
 




 What would be a theoretical time scale for something like this occurring? (not in real life, but if the gif were in years, how many?) 




 You'll get better at it as you go, so start with what you can manage, then do something else. As you work through it, what you can do will probably increase. Also, not knowing your major, you don't always need to read the whole article to understand what they're claiming and how they did it. This is a big time saver.

Also, organize your stuff. Whether it's Mendeley (my favorite), Endnote, ReadCube, or another program, don't just have a folder on your desktop or documents folder with PDFs floating around. You'll never be able to find anything or you'll take too much time organizing it for it to be effective. 




 I worked with the base uPrint model in grad school and we went off the service plan and there were a ton of issues. I replaced the print head, the chamber fans, the tips (this is more of a they need it eventually thing), and I've even taken the print head off and put it in an oven to get support material that leaked to soften enough so I could hit it with a hammer while it cooled so the thing would switch between the two heads.

When they work, they work great. When they don't, they're awful.

The thing that happened at the base is surprisingly common I would say. Also, the base plates are reusable. Completely. You can either dissolve the material off or take a chisel to it (carefully) and any material will pop off. 




 After spending lots of time on here (and time elsewhere such as Google) I've come up with nothing. 

I'm looking for a 3D printer that can print in wax and ABS/PLA (not necessarily at the same time and not necessarily both ABS/PLA) for work. I know there are printers that will do one or the other, but I haven't found anything. I think the closest has been one of Stratasys's printers but those are ridiculously expensive and my experience in Graduate school left me jaded (Dimension uPrint).

Any help would be much appreciated 




 I had SolidWorks available to me in graduate school and would always add material properties to stuff until it looked the way I wanted and then I would have SolidWorks render the image in 3D and it always looked nice, but may not be as great for chemistry type figures 




 Here's a link to the abstract for anyone who wants it. I haven't been able to read the article yet, but will be doing so sometime today:

Edit: Ok, so I read through the paper and it is interesting, and it does work quite well, but I'm a bit concerned that they're using 1 L of blood as their sample. The tests were compared with traditional tests and found results of sensitivity and specificity that ranged from 100%-77% and 91%-82%.

It seems like a good platform, and yes, current tests today may be less than $34 each, but the start up costs and training are what are the problems IMO. They also said that after clinical trials they were able to improve sensitivity by increasing the antibody spotting concentration on the gold nanoparticles, but that seems kind of obvious. 




 Title is definitely misleading

 As someone who just moved out of one of those cities and into one not on that list...I have made a terrible mistake 




 1984
First time ever. Also watched the movie. 




 Thanks for the review. I'm generally a fan of what they do, but recently it's been a bit of a struggle bus.  It's unfortunate this one didn't live up to their past work, especially V and The Matrix.  Guess I'll probably wait till Netflix or RedBox have it 




 Knowing people who did it and paid for more than I did (I had auto insurance/cell phone covered by parents cause it was convenient and didn't cost them much extra) it's quite possible.  Basically make your own food as much as possible and avoid going out, don't get TV; stick with Netflix, avoid movie theaters.  Traveling is kind of out of the picture, except maybe once per year as is new technology.

Also, live somewhere cheap.  I lived in Tucson where the $15K-$25K stipend is enough. If you pick a place like New York, it won't be and that'll be difficult.
