 It sure did.  I mean, to see something with that much value in this world see it's demise in such a horrific way.  
  
I bet that port tasted so good... 




 How old is his daughter?  I think that if the weapon you use is underage, you can't be charged as an adult. 




 Reminds me of Jason Bourne when he fought that guy with only a pen. 




 Ribbed for her murder. 




 I bet he said something hilarious when you did it, too. 




 Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't.  Almond Joy's got nuts, Mounds has a small dosage of strychnine. 




 Was the roll of TP in the over or under orientation?  One way gets you off the hook for the crime and the other gets you water boarded for being a toilet paper terrorist. 




 Solved or unsolved? 




 I don't know if I should trust you with a brownie...but I am hungry.  Oh what the hell!  Why not?  What's the worse that could happen? 




 A game of 500+ card pickup can be hell on the back.  Maybe she ruptured some nerves while bending over to pick them up and effectively paralyzed herself from the neck down.  Once paralyzed, she fell to the floor, only since she's paralyzed...she couldn't catch herself and hit her head on your night stand and broke her neck. 




 I guess you could turn it up to 11? 




 I guess cigarettes really DO kill people... 




 Baxter, you know I don't speak Spanish! 




 Ant bites him on the neck, his throat swells up, dies from asphyxiation.  Boom. 




 I've watched this movie many many times and I still don't get what is going on with the frozen orange juice stock. 




 Katy Perry high fiving a shark.

 The Invisible Woman. 




 Ah man...that almost rhymed. 




 Vin Diesel with hair just looks strange to me. 




 I agree.  Definitely make a date more than just a movie. 




 1, 5, 7, 6, 2, 4, 3  
  
If the original comes on television at any time of the day, I will watch at least 10 minutes of it. 




 Actually, if you go to the movie first, that gives you a subject to talk about while you're having dinner.  Whether it was a good or bad movie, you can jump start a conversation by sharing opinions about the movie. 




 This one time, I put two on to protect my wien...oh wait..."condiment". 
  
Never mind. 




 Water boarding? 




 Hmmm.  Bristle end or handle end? 




 That sounds like a great way to go.  And now I'm hungry for a brownie. 




 You live by the keyboard and you die by the keyboard, I guess. 




 Corded or wireless mouse?  It does make a difference. 




 Might be me just being weird, but that one made me laugh out loud.  Just thinking of how you could do that. 




 Don't worry, I won't.  That rabbit hole is too deep. 




 That sounds like it came straight from the game. 




 I'm bored. 









 Not just a Supra, but a white one. I think that has some kind of imagery behind it. 




 Yes, I am glad that I didn't. I don't want him to worry about something that I did to myself in the past. He has his own issues to deal with and I didn't feel like burdening him with one of mine.

And what you said last is something that I find to be very true now. Last night I found out that my friend has gone through the same exact situation I'm in now...only 8 years ago. After our talk last night, I realized that we have a lot more in common than I originally thought. 




 I'm going through a lot of shit right now (that I don't feel like divulging at the moment). I got a text from a friend asking if I wanted to join him for some drinks at a bar tonight. I said sure and a couple of hours in, we were having serious conversations about our lives.

I came really close to telling him about how the scar on my arm was from when I felt my life was in a tailspin and the pain from cutting was the only thing that I could actually control. As soon as I got ready to say it, I chickened out. I just couldn't imagine what one of my closest friends would think about me.

I don't cut anymore, but every time I sweat while playing basketball or working out...it becomes very visible. I guess that will be with me for the rest of my life.

There's no real point to this post. I just needed to get that out. 




 When I maxed out my first credit card, buying stupid things that I thought I needed at the time. 




 When the website didn't work, I tried the Windows app...
  
When the Windows app didn't work, I tried the phone app...  
  
When the phone app didn't work, I tried a homing pigeon...  
  
When the pigeon shit on my hand, I choked him and tried the website again.

 Arrr! Swiggity swooty, I'm coming for me booty! 









 ...or sleepy. 




 Risky clicks are part of life, meat bag.

 The engine doesn't move the jet through the air, but instead moves the air around the jet.

 I am currently practicing the ancient art of Involuntary Celibacy.  Wax on, wax off...indeed. 









 They sold part of their shoe?  Why would they do that? 




 Yeah, that would be a mess...and a lot of money invested in yellow pins. 




 Gotcha.  I was just thinking you would have a lot more yellow pins if you marked every single place you have ever gone through. 




 What qualifies a place as a pass through (yellow pin) for you?  Traveling through a place and not staying a full day or what? 




 /u/trollabot test_subject5209 




 With great care I began feeding my line down that deep asshole.  


That sounds like a snippet from an audiobook of a porno... 









 Don't you mean, ready for *a* shit? 




 Ask [her](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/buffy/images/a/aa/Faiths7.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110914010104) 




 There we go. 




 Is it horse Pepsi? 




 Amazing quote, man.  Wish I would've posted it first. ;) 









 It possibly could and actually, it's *Miss* Chanandler Bong... 




 Not sure how...but I think I just got laid from reading that. 




 I saw it recently on my FB feed and thought that it fit the show's situation perfectly. 




 That's so smooth, she'd be waiting for Player 2 to enter the game before she even realized what he really said.

The sheep do not want the dog around. He looks too much like the wolf. He reminds them that danger lurks out there just beyond the relative safety of the fence.
  
The wolf also hates the dog. He knows that it is the dog that stands between him and his prey. It is because of the dog that he is lean. The dog is the reason the wolf is forced to stalk the darkness.
  
The dog knows these facts. Undeterred, he stands watch, ever ready to do battle. Despite that he is a welcome guest in their midst, the dog is ready at a moments notice, to give his life in defense of his flock. It is simply who he is. 




 For me, it's not finding out how the war between Angel's crew and Wolfram   Hart ended. 




 I miss that show. :( 









 Sure, but if you were grazed by a bullet...wouldn't you tell people you've been shot? 




  burning dickbutt

Sounds like a very painful STD. 









 Even your mom? 









 Those would make some killer earrings. 














 I guess I would just show the interviewer this [picture](http://i.imgur.com/GOy98Tf.png). 




 A cashew.
