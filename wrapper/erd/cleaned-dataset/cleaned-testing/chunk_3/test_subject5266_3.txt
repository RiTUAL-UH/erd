 HAHA Lemmings :P thats a decent point, shall be making nose smaller :) 




 Hey what about this do you think I'm joking about? Happy to answer any questions :) 




 This game looks great I can't wait to play it. 




 Haha yeah I always get mixed responses to my goofy art style, I've attempted to try something different and have posted it to the OP, lemme know what you think. 




 :P thanks, yeah these are concepts, not final versions :) the script will be proofed no worries :) 




 Ok fair call, might mess around with different art styles, see if I can use my limited skill with more efficacy. 

Thanks for the feedback :)

EDIT 2: Thankyou so much for all the feedback so far, I have revised the artstyle and altered the character design as people have suggested and this is where I am going:

Basically the game plays like a chose your own adventure/screen based game (maybe like visual novels? I dunno never played one), you have conversations with characters and decide where the plot goes by what the character does and what tale she ends up experiencing :)

I'm planning on having vastly different story threads depending on every choice you make, you could befriend someone or kill them :o - characters could betray you or you may never know their true motivations by the end. 

Because there are going to be a lot of panels, I've chosen a simple artstyle. I may also include a QTE decision system for high pressure moments, but it won't be anything complex, because I don't like complex QTEs.

Would you play this kind of game? 

Edit: wow! thanks for the comments, feedback and upvotes ^_^ 
 









 "War... War has changed..." vs. "War... War never changes..." It's almost like Kojima wrote that line to challenge the inherent view of our culture's tendency to fetishize violence and revere warriors as mythic things instead of seeing them as people who are mistreated by those in power. 

Nice observation! I like it. Good point. 




 Yeah it's kind of like Andy warhol, creating new art from pop culture. 




 I love how Kojima can use a wildly contrasting tone (camp 60's in this case) and still deliver a really serious and compelling criticism of war.

I love how MGS3 basically shows how soldiers are used and abused by governments for their own ends. There is no king and country bullshit here.

MGS is basically pop culture porn, but it is NOT war porn, something I appreciate greatly in the franchise and in a climate where MANY video games and even similar genres are playing up war as "cool" in a direct and shameless fashion - it's nice to see MGS actually having something to say about the shitty state of affairs our world has become. 




 sweet thanks! 




 I have two games in the works currently, the trailer for the first is a free one here (i took a break for a long while so ignore the release date lol)

The one I'm writing atm on the side is a graphic choose your own adventure type thing. ^_^

How about you? 




 Twine sounds amazing, is it free to use even if you sell your game? I just need it for the "screenplay" so to speak, not the game making, which I'm doing in Construct 2 




 This looks cool! 




 Traditional script writing software has been fine for my linear stories but how do I legibly construct a non linear narrative with different endings? A story tree writing solution would be immensely helpful so any suggestions? Preferably free options :) 









 The Thing is a singleplayer game where any of your team could be infected at any moment and attack you. You have to maintain their trust and if you think someone is turning you have to make hard decisions IIRC. Great game, haven't played it in years though. 




 Not surprised by the American news shows introduction emphasizing the money he makes to legitimize his past time, because money is everything...

not...

He looks like he enjoys his profession and thats the main thing - being happy and not hurting anyone in the process :]

 




 Wow love a new sci fi setting :) 




 Need to finish those Witcher books! Can't wait for this game.
