 Almost 12 hrs timezone difference... 




 It's 11.08 PM here :P 









 What's the time there? 




 Hey, what are you doing? 




 Hmmm... No... I am not frustrated, but I just never listen to it. I never feel like listening to music... 




 You're not alone. I don't care about any kind of music. 




 He's a time traveller. 




 I don't care about an SO at this stage... 




 I'm from India! 




 Which part of the world still has snow? 




 #NoSOMasterRace 




 You're just like me! 




 No SO... 




 Lucky you, that's it's cold... I am burning here at 41C... 




 It was released last month... 




 Also, I am making a ton of typing errors today on my mobile :P 




 A group of aliens invade earth and shift all the humans to some part Australia. Only a girl remains in New York city and she tries to find her mother along with an alien. A really good movie :) 




 And as for other animated movies, did you see Home? 




 Frozen! And I am big fan of other animated movies too... Which was the last Disney movie you watched? 




 Don't post a selfie. 




 I still watch Disney movies, too... I love them :D 




 It was similar here, too! There used to be a Mickey mouse show on free TV! 




 I love Disney! 




 I still watch these, reminds me of my childhood...   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ycRnLo5HQU 




 But they always end up in the play offs... 




 I just followed the scores, I am watching IPL... 




 Pretty late :P 




 I love cricket! 




 I am up because it's 11.30 AM here. 




 Praise SfR! 




 /u/archon820 confirmed. 




 Now it is... 









 Might sleep in 15 minutes :D 




 Soo... When do you plan to sleep? 




 Pretty obvious, it's /u/shillfrombrad. 




 Not doing much in my free time... Reading books, drawing, and tinkering with my mobile... And Just Books is near-ish to my house, too! 




 No problem! 




 Yep, 10th boards...


You could try JustBooks library... It has a big collection of books... 




 I was trying Android app development, but now I am reading a book... I don't care if I wake up late as my boards got over... 




 Indeed, small world! :D 




 Which city are you in? 




 Pune :) 




 Fellow Indian spotted! 




 midnight


You from Asia? 




 Hmmm... Didn't really see the SOT as my sister is not home now-a-days... But I will try to let you know by tommorow. I can confirm though, it does not take a big hit.  




 Same here. Second Gen Dual SIM. 




 Visit this sub. 




 Not exactly, I am using Lollipop on my sister's Moto g 2nd Gen, and it's fine... 




 I am doing this : https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/building-ui.html 




 I am fine, but very sleepy as it is 12.40 AM here! 




 Yeah, that's what I had! 




 Indian food... 




 You have a Moto G. Why don't you just upgrade? 




 Hey, what's up? 




 Also, the best place for this would be /r/PickAnAndroidForMe.
 




 Buy the Moto G first gen. It has a better display than moto e. But if you an SD card slot, why don't you consider the Moto E 2nd gen? 




 #MKBHD IS A SHILL! 




 Hey, even I am learning to code! But I am finding it tough... 




 And I am feeling sad for making it that way :( 




 /uj Man, please visit /r/SuicideWatch. It might really help you :-) 




 :-) 




 Check it now :D 




 /uj Man, I was not being serious there... 




 I loved 5.1.1. 5.1 solved many of 5.0's glitches, and was very smooth as well. 




 /uj wasn't it equally snappy? 




 /uj Did you try 5.1? 




 Why did the chicken cross the road?


To get to the ugly man's house.


Knock knock


Who's there?



The chicken. 




 In what way do you plan to commit suicide? 




 The biography of Lal Bahadur Shastri. That book taught me what honesty and sacrifice is. 




 Yes! Very much :D 




 Hello! I have never been out of my country :( 




 Nice! Even I want to go somewhere in this vacation! 




 It's definitely fun, but removing the colours is a pain :P 




 My vacations are going on, and it's all feeling the same to me! 




 You might enjoy Holi! 




 Done! :) 




 Yeah! What about you? 




 Delhi. There are just too many heritage sites to explore! 




 Hey! 




 Yeah, X was difficult!

 Yes, that's what I might do today! Would you like to see one of the pictures I took?


  




 Yeah, I was too bored and there was nothing to do :D 




 It did, but nothing much. But there was a bug no nice y and I think my whole colony must have gotten up as it was 12.30 Am xD 




 Nothing much, just riding and drove into a car which was parked XD 




 Just lying around. Feel down yesterday while riding a cycle, and my whole body hurts :( 




 So, what's up today?
