 What was he supposed to do? Get out and challenge them to fisticuffs one at a time? What if he doesn't stand a chance at winning, or they gang up on him?

OK, so that's a bad idea. Well... drive away? Wait, they're surrounding me, I might bump into them. "Sorry Mr. Drunk Asshole, I'll put the car in park and let you ruin me financially and destroy my livelihood"

How about the third solution. Oh wait there isn't one. I guess we'll let violent people just walk all over us.

What's your solution exactly? I'd like to hear it. 




 I might be thinking of a different, similar video, but weren't these people charge with battery? 




 All you have to do is make more money of the DRM than you would have if you didn't include it. Let's simplify and say that including DRM has the following associated costs (we'll ignore 'brand damage', like people not buying future games, and other costs for simplicities sake):

-Development costs of the DRM: $500
-Lost sales due to customers disliking DRM: $250
-DLC sales lost from unhappy customers: $100
-People returning the game because DRM prevents if from playing: $100
Loss: $950

However, by preventing the game from being torrentable immediately, a small fraction of people who were on the fence about torrenting vs buying now cave in and buy the game. If these people's sales exceed $950, the DRM is worth it. Furthermore, the DRM might be developed for one game, but used for future games, meaning including it in future titles won't even cost the full $500.

Having said that, the data isn't usually as clear cut (hard to quantify gained sales vs lost sales for including DRM, for example). However, I think it's fair to say that these companies have some reasonable data supporting their decisions. I'm not entirely convinced that DRM is 'useless' like most people seem to think. It might be, but the mere fact that companies, with access to way more data about their products than us, are so adamant about using it leads me to believe that there must be some argument for it. Or maybe it is costing them money and they just don't have the data to realise it.

The point is, whether it's actually good or not isn't just a simple case of "people hate it" or "it'll get cracked anyway".

Another pro-DRM argument is maybe the technology is costing them money on products sold today. But maybe they're just using today's products as guinea pigs to make better DRM for a future generation. 




 Sad and lonely, sure. I think it's missing the 'crazy' criteria. 




 Insurance rates are determined by looking at your background and comparing it to statistical info to find a marketable price point that will yield the greatest profit (the goal of any product, really).

So if you have a heart condition, you are obviously more likely to require medical treatment for a heart condition, so it's a bigger risk to them to offer you insurance, hence it costs more. I'm sure you already knew that though.

Makes sense right?

Well, gender has been show to play a huge role in the number of accidents you have.

Men are more likely to be involved in dangerous car crashes, usually where the driver is at fault. However, these don't often result in insurance claims (I don't think?) and are not as numerous as small crashes. On the other hand, women are much more likely to be involved in small crashes that result in insurance payouts.

Hence, women are more expensive to provider coverage for.

I've seen a lot of people complain about this being unfair, but it makes sense to me. If you cover 100 men and 100 women on the same rates, the group of women is going to cost you a lot more.

(I'll just note by saying I've never read the studies this info is based on myself, but I've never heard anyone criticise them so I've always assumed they must be pretty solid and still up to date). 




 You're preaching to the choir. 




 Do homeopaths believe that you can get drunk off a single drop of alcohol in a glass of water? Also does it have to be water? Could I dilute medicine inside milk?

Or vice versa, could I put a drop of milk into water and 'increase' the amount of fats/protein/etc my body gets out of it? Or does it only work with curing things?

Finally, only liquids? Or can I put one part of say, sleeping gas, inside a bag with a ton of 'regular air' and knock myself out?

Basically, what decides what can be diluted and still effective and what can't?

(No, I'm not suggesting homeopathy actually works. I know it's quack medicine. I'm just more interested in what THEY believe). 




 He's probably a virgin. 




 I think I was one of the few people that really liked the Steam Workshop. It was actually a selling point that convinced me to buy several games instead of pirate. I can't believe they just monetized community mods. I'm fucking done. Pirating every single player game from here on out. 




 Yeah, I tried restarting about 5 times to no avail. Can only seem to find non-Australian servers or play solo. 




 I think it's fine for balance reasons, but it just feels weird. More like the button is unresponsive rather than that it's too slow for balance purposes. I'd like to see them tweak animations and speed to make it fill a bit more natural. 




 I had no problem playing the game yesterday, but now when I press the matchmaking button it just does nothing.

I can't use the server browser either because there does not seem to be any servers under 100 ping (I live in remote Australia). The matchmaking games I found yesterday all had under 100 ping though. 




 I'm sure Tripwire appreciate any feedback, even if it something they ultimately decide will stay regardless of opinions.

I'd rather let people voice their opinions here freely then let you decide what does and doesn't qualify as a viable complaint/reddit thread. 




 For example, someone causes me to suffer an injury and a costly hospital bill. I take out money of a large interest account, and sue the party. It takes years to get that money back. I win the case and get the lump sum to cover my medical bill. Do I also get the interest I could have earned had the money remained in my account for a longer period?

What about lost opportunities (like using that money to buy a cheap house)? 




 Step 1: Create Reddit Account

Step 2: Comment anywhere on Reddit and casually mention that you're a young girl

 Maybe he's secretly a wizard which is how he accomplishes his occasional feats and survives so much physical punishment, but he hides it because bounty hunters are after him.

Or maybe an alien failing to fit in with humans.

Maybe... Not. 




 Probably because OP didn't ask why it is the way it is. 














 But why not just use historical data to determine better wait times? For example, if after 12pm, on average, each patient is waiting for 20 minutes, then book the first patient after 12pm twenty minutes later than usual to 'fix' the accrued wait differences due to the compounded late patients.

It seems like all the data to cut down wait times should be available. 




 Edit: so HARD for them to estimate wait times 




 There just seem to be a lot of them.

 He probably didn't know who he was at all and misheard his name when people off camera tried to tell him who it was. 









 But they do, it just takes 14 hours. 




 So the answer is: yes. You would just have to keep your head submerged for a very long time. 




 While other people's answers are more on point, in general, it's just as easy to pirate anything. The vast majority of videogames have the same low quality piracy checks. 




 I think he already covered that in his post...

 but no way to verify if it is due to the Final Solution.

 




 You ignore the scenario where the creator gets nothing (usually if they work for a large company). 




 If it's a film based camera (not digital) and someone takes a photo with it, wouldn't you be the owner of the physical film? What if the camera was stolen to take the picture? You own the film that the image is printed on, but the shooter owns the rights to the image?

What if they take a photo with my camera (digital) and I refuse to give it to them to get 'their' property off it? Can I delete the photo if they have no copies?

What if I let them use my camera, they take an awesome picture and show it to them (still on the camera) to a third party who wants to purchase it for $200. Can I delete the picture before they copy it to a PC in this instance? Or would I owe $200?

 I made [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1tsmsv/sherlock_holmes_gregory_house_and_adrian_monk/) a bit over a year ago. I've decided to redo it, but with some changes, as there were some flaws with it last time.

The contestants this time will be: 

* **Ambrose Monk** replacing Adrian Monk. He is to Adrian what Mycroft is to Sherlock. However, after working closely with a psychologist, he has beaten most of his major issues and is able to compete on Jeopardy with minimal hassle.

* **Gregory House**, however he is fully motivated to win at all costs.

* **Sherlock Holmes** - specifically, the Sherlock from the BBC adaption, enabling him to level the playing field by not being at a 100 year disadvantage.
* **Batman** - Generic Batman
* **Adam West Batman** - From the 60s live action Batman.
* **Shawn Spencer** from the television show Psych.

What order does each contestant come in in the following rounds:

Round 1: Ambrose vs House vs Holmes

Round 2: Batman vs Adam West Batman vs Shawn

Round 3: The winner from each round faces off

Bonus Round: The audience votes for a their favourite contestant. Who most likely wins the audience over with their overall performance, personality and banter with Trebek.

There is no cheating (no, Batman doesn't get the answers beforehand with prep time). It's a legit contest and assume everyone is motivated to win. Because reasons. 














 From wiki:

The value of Finnegans Wake as a work of literature has been a point of contention since the time of its appearance, in serial form, in literary reviews of the 1920s. Initial response, to both its serialised and final published forms, was almost universally negative. Even close friends and family were disapproving of Joyce's seemingly impenetrable text, with Joyce's brother Stanislaus "rebuk[ing] him for writing an incomprehensible night-book",[198] and former friend Oliver Gogarty believing the book to be a joke 




 I tend to pirate most games. Occasionally I will go on to buy the actual game if it's really good. This is something I've noticed while doing this. Anyone know why? 




 I don't recall one apartment that wasn't littered with cardboard boxes. If they existed, they were in the minority. Were people just constantly moving houses? 









 No ratings system to help filter quality stages from the rest, no search by author so talented stage creators can easily share there work. There aren't even shareable codes for stages. I was really looking forward to this feature since I've seen some great custom stages online, but it's not possible to share them without manually adding the author to my friends list. Anyone else disappointed in this regard? 









 I drink low fat because my girlfriend is a diet and exercise freak and I just assumed it's better. However, one day I just realised I don't have many fats in my diet at all. Should I start buying my own milk?

 The bomb is a special bomb that can only be disarmed with doubles. The 4chan user has no doubles currently on him so he has to get doubles of his own. He uses a nearby laptop to attempt to get the doubles. The laptop comes pre-equipped with 4chan's homepage already loaded and several hundred Christian Bale pictures.

His board of choice, but he must balance the odds of a slow board not being anywhere near doubles (and considering post restrictions) vs the difficulty of timing dubs on a fast board.

Can he do it in time?

 Comment text. 



















 I'm applying for some part time work and stumbled upon a few jobs by this title. Hours look really good to suit Uni, but I'm not entirely sure what it actually involves. Some of the position descriptions include activities such as:

 All aspects of merchandising for leading magazines publishers

 Ensuring products receive the maximum benefit of promotional activity with effective product placement and visual displays using provided point of sale

 Maintaining authorised planogram compliance and stock replenishment

 Reporting on competitor activity

Does it involve sales of some sort? Because I'd be terrible at that. Is it just stocking shelves in Supermarkets? Any insight here? 




 I've always known it as a class in Final Fantasy, but it's also the title given to one of the characters in Game of Thrones. Where did the term originate from? 




 This might belong on Out of the Loop, because I just plain and simply don't know much about this shit. Also I understand that the goals of the people... attacking videogames (???) are not necessarily consistent.

But as a general rule of thumb, what are the main changes they want to see in the videogaming world? Like, if we all 'surrendered' and they typed up a list of demands to be immediately actioned, what would that list include? 









 Is there a directory or database of doctors that I have to register through? How do THEY check that I'm licenced? Or is it as simple as applying to a hospital, getting some friends to act as references and getting a job like any other?

 Cosmic turtle is canon? 




 From this page:

"Sony no longer produces an annual report."

Do they have any reporting requirements enforced by law? Can a public company just withhold it's information like that? What if shareholders want audited financial statements?

 These characters attempt to prank one another. They have one year to pull off their prank and may execute at any time throughout the year. Who pulls off the greater prank?

Round 1) Batman vs Spiderman

Round 2) Jar Jar Binks vs Yoda

Round 3) Spock vs Data

Round 4) Goku vs Superman

Round 5) Bruce Almighty vs The Mask (Carrey's)

Round 6) Bill Gates vs Steve Jobs (era: 2005)


Bonus Round: Can George Taylor prank back the Planet of the Apes? Assuming he attempts to do so from the end of the first movie (so the sequels have yet to happen) with one year prep time.

 The Chosen Undead (Dark Souls), Bearer of the Curse (Dark Souls 2), The Hunter (Bloordborne) and the playable character from Demon's Souls enter a round robin tournament. Who wins?

You may build these characters anyway, with any weapons, based on the following restrictions:

Round 1) Starting classes only.

Round 2) Level 60 (distribute how you wish)

Round 3) All skills at their hard caps

Who is the ultimate winner? 




 I know it's probably too early, but I'm willing to accept speculation. Basically, I'm hoping to buy one in November as a Christmas present for my brother. However, as I live outside of the US, I will pretty much need to buy it ASAP in order for it to get here in time.

So: thoughts on it's viability as a controller in each genre? I'm most dubious about FPS games. Seems like it would be great for third person games.

What about stuff like Civ V? Would it actually be comfortable for extended periods?

RTS/MOBA are the only genre I'd immediately rule out having not used one. 




 Stemming from this discussion [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/30t18v/why_enterprise_is_getting_another_look_and_why/)

It seems a lot of people did not appreciate how much Voyager jumped the shark and filled the Universe with too much overpowered technology that would limit any Trek's set post-Voyager.

The show is also often cited as being one of the low points in the franchise.

So what if it was officially de-canonised and a new Trek took it's place taking place after Deep Space 9? Would you be interested in seeing this happen? 









 I don't know why this sub requires it to be mandatory I supply text here since my thread does not need more than the title in the first place, so here is some text - and now I have to wait 10 minutes to make my post again because of this pointless rule. 
























 Tried in home streaming and the lag was awful. Would upgrading my router (it's an entirely wireless connection, btw) be the best way to resolve this? What are other major factors that would affect in home streaming? 









 I'm wondering if I should commit to just fully upgrading my Kirkhammer, or should I hold onto some resources for later weapons? I'm trying to go for a simple Vit/Strength build for my first playthrough (with a little stamina thrown in). 




 I've tried both servers and the ping is pretty bad. Have any Australian players found a solution? Is there any possibility of getting SEA servers at some point in the near future?

From what I've played, this game looks pretty enjoyable, but the ping is a huge turn off. 









 Referring to the US.

It's illegal to hire a prostitute for sex, however it IS legal to hire an actor to have sex with someone else for the production of pornography.

So could four people (we'll say M1, M2, W1 and W2) get around prostitution laws by paying eachother off to make porn?

For example, M1 can't hire W1 as a prostitute. However, he could agree to hire W2 to have sex with M2 and request they film it (and upload the video to the Internet to fully ensure it's purpose as porn, even if it's to a deliberately small and unadvertised website) and in return M2 pays W1 to do the same for M1. M1 and M2 work for free.

Technically it'd just be porn, but the effect is just basic prostitution (providing you're willing to let the video go on the net).

Could you take it a step further and have 'brothels' that match participants for them, acting as an Agent on their behalf, and even include a service to blue the faces? If that's too much hassle, just use really, really low quality film and remove the sound?

To summarise: people basically just hire prostitutes for eachother and call it porn. 




 Daily? Weekly? Monthly? I guess it would vary pretty wildly, so I'll ask the question for two broad categories and accept generalised answers:

A) Famous porn stars. One's many people would know
B) The 'average' porn star

Is it common for people to just do it once or twice and never again? Do most pornstars do it as their primary job or 'on the side' for some extra dosh? 









 And does he do anything else other than stand there? Sounds like an amazing job. 




 New to the game, my weapons are starting to feel really outdated and I'm not getting any good mod drops.

I've got blueprints for a Grakata and Heat Sword just sitting there ready to go, all but for 2 neurodes and a neural sensor. Where can I get these items ASAP? I've done the first two missions on Jupiter (first + Io) and found none as well as no neurode drops on Earth.

Why can't I seem to find any? They just drop from enemies right? 














 Three handicapped, but otherwise perfectly identical Batman's all face up against one another. Each has a unique handicap that will inhibit them in the fight. You may choose any Batman from any continuity or just answer for Batman in general since it's a larger generalisable answer between Batmen anyway.

Each Batman has a handicap: one Batman is missing a single arm (at the shoulder), another is missing a single leg (at the hip) and the third is missing both eyes, but has all limbs intact.

No gadgets that can overcome their handicaps can be used (robot limbs,  sonar replacing his eyes, etc).

**RULES**

-ALL ROUNDS ARE ROUND ROBIN STYLE TOURNAMENTS (three 1v1's as opposed to a single 1v1v1).

-NO PREP TIME IN ANY ROUND. They're thrown right in only finding out who their foe is at the last second.

-No leaving the warehouse

**Round 1:** Hand to hand combat with NO GADGETS. Takes place in an empty warehouse.

**Round 2:** Basic gadgets are allowed. The standard arsenal of Batman minus access to vehicles (so no remote controlling the Batmobile in to run the other Batman over). Takes place in standard warehouse.

**Round 3:** A large warehouse filled with crates, shipping containers and rafters. Completely dark, no lighting, emphasizing Stealth. Each Batman may use gadgets batarangs, grappling hooks and smoke pallets.

**Key**

Just to prevent confusion...

One legged Batman will be referred to as 1L.

One armed = 1A

No eyes = NE 









 It seems after Chappie opinions regarding the Blomdog have shifted a little around here. Are you still excited for Blommer's Alien movie? Do you think he has was it takes to pull it off, so to speak? 




 Their only option is to shoot one or the other with a potentially lethal shot (no time to close in as they are about to stab eachother in the heart). 




 Let's say Bill Clinton goes to stay at Obama's place to play videogames and have pizza all night. Each President is assigned mandatory security, so what happens in this scenario? Does Obama's guard just look after Clinton for the night, or does Clinton's security tag along? 




 I'm just going to rattle off some questions here that I'm curious about concerning the President's occupation of the White House...

1) When the President moves out, can he take any furniture with him? Does the new President inherit the furniture? What about stuff like mattresses and linen?

2) How much of the White House is the President's personal living space? I mean, does he have a garage he can go mess around in that no one else can enter? A loungeroom? Or is it like living with a ton of roommates all day?

3) Does the President get private Internet access? Can he watch porn with no one knowing?

4) What about buying personal things he might not want others to see? How does the First Lady buy lingerie? Sex toys? Etc?

5) Can the President choose to redecorate at will? What if he buys a new couch with his own money for the White House loungeroom? Does he get to take it with him when he leaves? What happens to the old one in the mean time?

6) Is there a White House landlord? Can the Pres make renovations as he wants? Or put in a new hook to hang a picture? Is he personally liable if he breaks something? 




 Also how likely would some sort of aircraft be at sneaking a nuke into the opposing country and dropping it manually?

Just how good are their anti-nuke defenses? 




 Alien can be any character from any franchise not born on Earth or part of the human species (so Thor would count, as he was not born on Earth). It also counts interdimensional beings and Gods, etc.

Round 1) It's a 'fist fight' on a football field. Contestants are not allowed their weapons (unless it's part of them).

Round 2) The alien is hunting Duke on the Nostromo. The strongest alien contender in this round can be no bigger than three times a the Xenomorph from the first Alien movie in order for it to move about the ship. Duke gets any and all weapons - but will risk structural damage by using them, as well as use of any of the equipment aboard the Nostromo.

Round 3) On an open field like round 1, but both sides get their equipment (whatever gear is typical of the alien and any weapon Duke has used).

 I'm just wondering what Steam Link actually does and what kind of equipment I need to minimise lag. I don't really have much of a home network beyond a cheap router and a PC. What exactly are the requirements for a good Steam Link connection? It performance dependent on my router?

Also I'm assuming the Steam Controller will use bluetooth? The only thing I have tried in this regards with my PC is a DS4 control, which had huge input lag. What is most likely to cause this issue (so I can get whatever gear is needed for Steam Link's release)? The DS4 or my Bluetooth dongle?

 **Gabe, the Trickster**
 
 **Lore**: Some shitty mage who got off on playing a lot of tricks on people. Eventually, while messing around with some magic to punk some fools he accidentally transported himself to a black void, where he encountered a glowing orb of light he came to know as "The Source", the beginning of all the universes. He tapped into a small portion of its power then bla bla bla he's fighting ancients.

**Q - Stat Shuffle**
 
| | |
|-|-|
| Ability | Target Unit |
| Affects | Ally or enemy Heroes |
 
 Shuffles the targets stats. If used on allies, a stat bonus is applied to all of the targets stats after the shuffle is complete.
 
**DURATION:** 8

**STAT BONUS:** 2/4/6/8

[](#mana) **MANA COST**: 95 / 105 / 115 / 125
 
[](#cd) **COOL DOWN**: 5 / 4 / 3 / 2
 
* For example, an enemy with 20s, 18a and 15i may wind up with 18s, 15a and 20i. However, an ally with those same stats will wind up with (assuming the skill is level 4) 26s, 23a and 28i. Depending on the difference between stats and the skills level, it could have a net positive affect on each stat if used on an ally. Low cooldown allows you to wreak havoc in a fight, although has short cast range.

**W - Break**
 
| | |
|-|-|
| Ability | Target Unit |
| Affects | Enemy hero |
 
 Breaks the fundamental connection between an enemies item and The Source, causing it to malfunction. Item is selected at random.

**DURATION:** 5/6/7/8
 
[](#mana) **MANA COST**: 120
 
[](#cd) **COOL DOWN**: 60 / 50 / 40 / 30
 
* An enemies malfunctioning item will be marked in his inventory. A malfunctioning item will continue to provide stat bonuses, but will not offer any other passive effects. Attempting to use the malfunctioning items active ability will result in a 50% chance of the active malfunctioning (doing nothing and going on cooldown), a 40% chance of it backfiring (varies from item to item. Abyssal Blade will cast on yourself, whereas BoTs will simply deal damage to you) and a 10% chance of functioning normally.

* It is NOT evasion, so it cannot bypassed with True Strike. Works pretty simply. After the final amount of damage is determined (after magic resistance, armour, other blocks, etc) the damage is reduced further by a random amount. For example, if Lina's ultimate would strike for 500 damage with this ability ignored, once the ability is taken into account (say, a level 3 Block) a random amount between 15% and 30% is blocked. In this case, say 20%. Only 400 damage will be dealt.

* This works as if rewinding the game in a replay. EVERYTHING goes back. If you used a BKB two seconds ago, and Gabe uses this ability, your BKB is back off cooldown, its time restored. All spells go back to whatever their cooldown was a few seconds ago. Etc. It's just like restoring a save state. It's a 'free undo' of a bad teamfight or an ally getting ganked. Nothing can prevent it or block it. 




 By that I mean, I don't need to do a bunch of missions introducing units and mechanics one at a time. And the missions involve traditional RTS objectives and style of play instead of escorting main characters through a level?

I'm specifically looking to play a single player campaign. I enjoy AoE, SC (original and II) and Sins of a Solar Empire. I've never played much Warcraft, but from what I could see it focused quite heavily on hero units, which I'm not that into. 




 Thanks. 














 And assuming they saved the two US citizens, would they face consequences for saving them over the POTUS?

Would the answer change if the two citizens were children?

The scenario isn't important, but imagine an ultimatum type scenario. A decision must be made - and quickly (maybe a hostage situation with only enough time to save one, or they're drowning, idk). Saving one group will lead to the death of the other group, doing nothing leads to everyone dying. For whatever reason they have to work as a group, so they can't split up an attempt to help both. Also, all this information is known to everyone involved. It's one or the other. 



















 I don't mind ordering from overseas. Looks like Ozgameshop ($74) is the cheapest I can find. 









 Frieza was considered to be the most powerful being of his time, and was for quite some time. Then all of a sudden, in the course of a few years, we go from Frieza to God level enemies.

How can there be so many levels of Super Saiyan above basic Super Saiyan without them ever being achieved in history before?  It's like if after years of 100m runners shaving milliseconds of someone's records, all of a sudden someone comes along and sets a record at 5 seconds. Then some other guy comes along and does it in 4, then a third guy in three all over the course of a few weeks.

If Super Saiyan is so rare, why are so many cropping up in the decade (or whatever) that DBZ takes place?

Why is everyone suddenly so powerful? Where were these bad guys a few decades before Goku?

**TL;DR: Why is this point in history seeing a sudden power spike?** 




 Scenario 1: Bruce Wayne is adopted by the [Nolastname's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Malcolm_in_the_Middle#Main_characters) after his parents deaths.

He is a genetically gifted child with the ability to excel in anything he does, but has a very different temperament to Malcolm and the boys. Does he excel in this environment or wind up like Frances?

Scenario 2: He is the birth child of Lois and Hal, replacing Malcolm. Genetically the same as he was before, except now his parents never died. How does this impact his development? Remember the negative impact his older brothers will have on his behaviour.

But this is who would win!

 For more info: it's a 27 inch monitor, and a smaller (21 inch?) monitor, around a 600 PSU in my PC and a 40W/240V desktop light and a 6 speaker set up. Currently I just have the larger monitor, PC and speakers plugged in. It comes from an extension cord that runs to a powerboard accross the room. Would the rest be too much?

I'm in Australia btw. 














 Skyrim is the obvious standout. What other games have made great use of the Steam workshop? 
























 I'm sure we're all aware of the classics by now: Pixelvision, Metro, Air, etc

But what are some nice, lesser known skins or newer skins that have impressed you? I feel like it's time for a change.
