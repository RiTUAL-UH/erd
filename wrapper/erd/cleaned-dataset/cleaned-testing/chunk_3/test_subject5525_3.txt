 Also the first time the word "vagina" was said on film. 




 I love KSC....live right up the road a bit, and I don't get out there enough.

I'm a space and science nerd, and I find plenty to keep me interested there. Totally worth admission.

Unfortunately, there are several paid add-ons at the park now. Didn't used to be that way, but new times, new money. The biggest is the new Up Close tour, which gets you in the VAB and STS mission control. I think it's around $25 more, per person. I haven't done it yet, but I have friends that say it's totally worth it.

Overall, even without the add-ons, especially if you haven't been there in quite a while, I say go. Kids dig it, adults dig it, but do try to plan your trip around a launch. Check NASA's webpage or sites like Space.com to try and find a day when a rocket is going up.

Enjoy your trip to the Space Coast! 




 NASA unveils Opportunity's little known Whitewater Rafting Assisting Program; Mars a "veritable water-park". 




 Oppurtunity found evidence that there *probably* was once water on Mars, *that may* have been drinkable. 









 Really? Never tried the Blue, and like I said, not much of a Scotch guy, but reviews are great...and I hear good things from the customers at our bar that are always upset that we don't carry it. But that might be snobbery.
 




 [Johnny Walker has a complete line-up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnnie_Walker#Blends) if you wanted to stay in the brand. I've had the Double Black, and I'm not much for the scotches, but it was gooood.

Or drop two bills for a bottle of Blue Label, and be a hero. 




 Be open and honest. It's your only hope.

Rip a page out of the girl's playbook and make a few pre-emptive comments to make sure she knows that she's hanging out in the friend zone.

But make sure that you're right about her being interested. This could possibly backfire in a big way. 




 I like boob-shaped boobs. 




 Dude here. 

Um, no. A lot of jokes, and there's an understanding that all of us do it, but that's about it.

I guess the closest I ever came to really having a conversation about it with a guy friend is recommending a personal lubricant (Coconut oil!) but no frank discussions. (My wife and I do, though) 




 I think it's completely okay to tell someone that you think they are wrong. But as an atheist, and a realist, I know from experience that people with deep held beliefs, especially those of faith, are not familiar with the idea of being wrong.

Sexuality and xtian beliefs are very difficult to navigate, and after OP states his issue as "GF won't have sex because of her christian reasons", I have great concern about any conversation along the lines of "Let me tell you why I think you are wrong about the way you feel about sex." OP's gf is likely translate that as "Let me tell you why your religion is wrong" which is probably a relationship ender, if she has strong beliefs.

Repeating myself, but certainly OP and gf have to talk. The two of them are going to be doing a lot of that, they will have to if they want a non-believer/believer relationship to work, but don't try to talk your way into sex, that's coercion at best, and when you combine that with trying to change someone's faith, it becomes something terrible.

My opinion. Meh. 




 Absolutely. But to attack those beliefs in order to change them, no matter how strongly he feels that she might be wrong in those beliefs, is wrong. 




 First off, your link is broken, it goes to the search page. But I found what you are talking about.

1. Lust and Fornication are sins. You are shit outta luck here bud. If she believes, then she believes, and belief is going to tell her that what she wants is wrong, and is bad. That's a tough one to get over.

2. Virginity is a gift. Sure it is. And if you guys are in love, then give it to each other. 

3. The risk of pregnancy. It is true that not having sex is a pretty sure fire way to not get pregnant. But my wife and I have had sex....oohh about 7 billion times and we have far less children than that.

4. Heartaches from dating. Sure, breaking up is terrible. But if you guys are sure that you're going to be married and like totally in love forever and ever, shouldn't be an issue then.

5. Virginity is cool. No, no it isn't. Neither is not being a virgin. It's just a state of being.

6. Sexual purity and God's plan. If she believes, then she believes. See point 1.

7. Fornication is not healthy. Well, unprotected sex might be risky, but the human body is built to do this sort of thing, so not so much.

Listen, if she has deep set xtian beliefs, you're going to have to respect that. You can't talk her out of thinking that her virginity is God's gift to her, for her to give to her husband, and only her husband, without attacking her religion at large. If you do that, then you don't respect her, and without respect you guys have no hope for that ever after bit that both of you are hoping for. (You can however, lead her to read, and maybe she'll begin to question her faith on her own, and then you can be there to help, but you can't push. Taking someone's faith just so you can take their virginity is a very special kind of rape.) Best of luck. 




 I've been on both sides of the bar for these events, and I can't tell you how true this is. If you don't tip, or don't tip well at free events, you will be ignored. A big tip will help me remember you.

 I don't think too many authors write like Robbins...but I liked [Chuck Palahniuk](http://chuckpalahniuk.net/) (Fight Club, Choke, Invisible Monsters) a lot, and for some of the same reasons. Be forewarned, he's far darker than Robbins. 




 I don't hold on to paperbacks. I buy a lot of them, but I feel that paperback books need to be free. If I like a book, I buy it in hardback, and shelve it. Most paperbacks I read and then set free. 




 If it's Fox news, does it really belong in r/news? 




 Not at all. I never saw my mom or dad drink when growing up. I have had a beer with my pops in the past five years, but I don't think that he does much drinking. 

I'm a more-or-less daiiy drinker.

I think my dad's dad, who died early, might have been an alcoholic. There wasn't much talk about it, but I get that feeling, you know. 




 I too am a FOH guy, though trained and most comfortable as BOH. I sort of fell into a job as a FOH guy, with food safety management responsibilities.

I like my job, it has its perks, but I'm working for less than I'm worth. Was hired on for less than I'm worth. Made that deal with the devil so my kids could go to a good school, and I live on the beach, and super close to work, so all good.

I hired on as the fourth manager. After the first one got fired since I was there (for theft and drugs) the boss decided to not replace. After the second one got fired (also theft and drugs) it was just the GM and I. 

During the next four years, we have had manager after manager brought in and fail. 

There was the KM that was transferred over from another unit to avoid sexual harassment charges. He was fired after a threat of another sexual harassment charge.

There was a FOH manager that was brought in that couldn't count. Couldn't keep his hands off of the girls. Made threats instead of plans. All around douche. He was fired, basically for being a douche.

There was the combo manager, FOH/BOH, that acted like it was his first time in the kitchen, had no idea how to talk to either customers or employees, and spent most of his time on the phone threatening his ex-girlfriend. (His wife had died under somewhat suspicious circumstances, as well). He was fired for being ineffective, and went over to his ex-girlfriends house and shot himself.

I put up with all of this and more. Got a couple of raises, basically each time someone got shitcanned, but not enough, but I appreciated the gesture. During this time, sales were down terribly, we work in a tourist town, and the recession fucked us, so I didn't make waves.

Last month, we brought in a KM to train for another restaurant, and a FOH guy for ours. (Side note, to explain how batshit insane the boss man is sometimes, our KM approached our boss interested in moving from hourly at our restaurant, to salary at the other unit. He was turned down, and then asked to train the KM that was going to take the job that he applied for. It was super effective.) 

While doing some EOM paperwork, I noticed an email that talked about how we were going to distribute the labor burden for the KM trainee, and I saw that he made 2k less a year than I did. Pissed. Did some digging and found out that the new FOH guy was hired on at 2k plus what I was currently making. More pissed.

Wouldn't have been that big of a deal, but this FOH guy doesn't do anything. Like all day, nothing. Walks around, talks on the phone, and does a hundred little things that work against the restaurant, not for it.

I approached my boss, and explained that this was unacceptable, and that if she was interested in keeping me (we get along famously and are a good team) that this needed to be addressed.

She approached the boss man, and the response that she got was "I didn't think that he (me) liked his job anyway..."

I started looking for new work the next day. Still there, but not for too much longer, and I won't be going out of my way to give notice or help train a replacement. 




 Yeah, sandwich stuff. All those ingredients going into the po-boys will have to have been prepared ahead of time.

Proteins: Peeling, cooking, cooling shrimp, slicing meats, that kind of thing.

Breads: Buying bread from a supplier means you'll have to slack (thaw out) bread, as it probably comes in frozen, if it's fresh, you're in early to bake. (Early, like 4 am)

Veggies: All have to be sliced and panned, for each days service.

Sauces: Prepped and/or cooked each day.

General Line Setup: Rotating stock, checking for freshness, getting ready for the day.

If you have any specific questions down the line, I'd be glad to help. I'm a trained chef, currently a food safety manager and supervisor, been working in the restaurant industry for 25+ yrs, from no star to four star. 




 Depends on the restaurant, and the menu.

In our generic restaurant, every morning you would need to do recipes. Things like sauces, soups, gravies, desserts. Any thing that would need cooking. You don't want to have to do that during service. (That wouldn't be the case in a restaurant that was very fine dining, where a lot of sauces and such are prepared from scratch, to order.) You would also need to do set-ups. Things that you are going to use frequently through the day. Maybe you garnish a dish with slices of red pepper, you would have to cut enough slices of red pepper to complete the amount of plates you expect to sell that day. You would also need to do flow-through and line set up. That would be putting all of your ingredients on the line, making sure everything is set up for the upcoming day's business, making sure your ingredients are fresh. (The things you need on the line probably need to be prepped as well. Whether sliced onions for sandwiches, or pre-made entrees like chicken cordon bleu, for example)

This is a very generic overview. Without information about what sort of restaurant and what kind of menu, I can't get more specific than that. 




 Sticky pans. There are a couple of methods of pan release when baking cakes. It depends on what sort of cake you are making. Most importantly, you should have a non stick cake pan without dings, dents, rust, scratches, pocks or debris.

For most cakes, you can use a spray release like Pam. If you follow directions when baking, let it cool slightly before releasing, it should pop out fairly easily.

As cake recipes rise in sugar content, they become a bit stickier. For higher sugar content cakes, like rich chocolates or cakes with fruit baked with or in them, you should use a coating of cold butter before putting the batter in the pan. If your cakes still stick using the butter method, try a light dusting of flour after coating with cold butter.

Cutting wax paper in a circle the size of the bottom of the pan will work well, make sure that you have the shiny side up. 

Also, never lift a cake out of a pan. Allow to cool, place a plate over the top of the cake pan, invert, tap the bottom and the cake should release cleanly. 




 I was a visitor before I became a resident. If you held a gun to my head and made me complain about something, I would point out that the property taxes are pretty high on beachside...but that's it. 

Have fun! I hope you enjoyed your stay! 




 Remove the nails using a pull block. (A small shim or small block of wood that you put under the head of your hammer before using the claw to pull them out.) Assuming your walls are gypsum or plaster or drywall, get a tub of drywall joint compound, or wall spackle, and fill the hole. (If wood walls, use wood putty, if stone walls, you live in a cave, don't worry about it.) After drying time, sand, then repaint with match paint, or repaint wall.  




 Yep, there are fetishists of all types, but they fit my example, I think. 




 I went to see him in Tallahassee. Couple of good friends, a whole lotta whiskey, prepped for a great night.

Got there early, decent seats, smaller venue. Gonna be a good show.

Opening act comes out.

Blown away. It's The Derek Trucks Band. (Here's a favorite of mine, [I'd Rather be Blind, Crippled, and Crazy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSbcpLLadX0), it's got a 15 second no-skip ad, but it's the best live version of that song that I know of. L 6:22)

Stole the show. Outstanding performer, super fun show.

Almost forgot that Eric Johnson was up next. His show, while still amazing, was far less satisfactory for me compared to the discovery (for me) of this new thing.

Unfortunately, I suppose I left that night less of a fan Eric Johnson. I still like what he does a bunch, and this song is my favorite of his. 




 Code is 166 KA. That's a champion Katana then. 




 Yep, Scarborough, isn't it? My dad worked that one this year.
 




 I know, it was very confusing. I know it when I see it...lemme see.

I guess the biggest difference could be described as girls that *are* big versus girls that let themselves get *bigger*, hope that helps. 




 The word fat gets thrown around a lot. Maybe too much. 

I have loved me some big girls. I know big girls that are fabulous, and delicious, and amazing.

But fat, in my opinion, implies a controllable situation. Not big boned, not large women, not beg girls, but *sloppy* ones. Girls that don't take care of themselves. Girls that are big in the all the wrong ways. I don't know how to accurately describe the difference, but every man here knows what I'm talking about.

Short answer: Being a big girl may decrease your chances in the dating game, but in no way is going to keep you from being successful. Being *fat* as in not caring about your weight, accepting your bigness and piling on bad diet choices on top of it because it doesn't matter any more...that kind of fat, is a huge turnoff to me, and to most guys I think. 




 Restaurant style french toast? Hmmm. You need thick sliced white bread for one thing. The batter mix is the same, but the biggest difference is in the cooking. Most of these joints are cooking on flattop grills that keep a real consistent heat. Best results at home are going to be found with a flat top griddle. Barring that, try a pan way bigger than you need, cook one piece at a time, make sure that your pan is heated correctly, and hot before you add the toast. That should come close. 




 Good luck my friend. I'm well into my second year of attempting to quit. Two weeks ago, right about when you started quitting, I had well manicured nails, longer than I wanted them. (Got in the way of playing guitar, and I kept cutting myself with them!) I had a rough night, and without really thinking about it, chewed/gnawed/gnarled/ripped/bit/crunched every millimeter of them away.

This was probably the fourth or fifth time that this happened.

Take it day by day, and don't give up, because you will probably backslide a time or two. 

Seriously, good luck to you, and everyone else fighting this ridiculous habit. There is every reason in the world to not do this. So do it. Do it for cosmetic reasons, because we know what our fingers look like; that's why we hide them. Do it for the health of your hands. You're two weeks in, probably no infections or redness anymore? It's nice, isn't it? Keep at it. 




 Terrible story, poor little girl. First time this American has heard it. 

And it's also terrible that the reporter researching this could possibly have to face charges for this. Hope UK cops and judges aren't quite as dense as our US ones.

Have to point out a few things though. The "Gateway" drug comparison doesn't hold water. Many studies have shown that marijuana use does not necessarily lead to harder drug use. There is correlation, but no causation. The same is true about porn. Those that actively search for child porn have looked for other porn types before. This does not mean that the use or search of other types of porn will lead to violent child porn. 




 I fucked a one-legged redneck meth addict girl. Does that count? Cuz she couldn't. 




 If it is an open gear tuning machine, that might be possible. Are you sure that it's not just the string slipping? When you put the string on, wrap the first coil of the tightening process over the top of the string coming out of the hole in the tuning peg, this will keep the string taught on the peg. 




 Okay BrandNew...

What kind of guitar? Electric? Acoustic? Classical? 

You were having a hard time with the G *string* I assume. You say that the *thing* is clicking, let's assume you mean the tuning peg, or tuning machine. 

When it clicks, is it happening at the tuning peg at the top of the neck, or somewhere else?

And, did you just recently string it, or re-string  your guitar?
 




 There was still plenty of that, I was just lucky to know some very cool people. 




 Hope it's a good show. I've seen him twice.

First time, in Tampa, he was so damn drunk, they had to bring a stool for him to sit on, which he promptly fell off of. Show went about 40 minutes before Bob walked off. Terrible.

Second show, much later, was amazing, other than the fact that Bob wore some sort of metallic silver suit and the shine coming from the spots reflecting off of him made him damn near invisible, but an amazing show. 




 Another great song! This one resonated with me after I became a father for the first time.
 




 That one, and The Times They are A Changin are probably my favorite to play from his early career. Both are just timeless, and seem to speak to me at different times in my life in different ways. 




 I've played guitar for almost 30 years now. I picked up my Dad's Gibson one day out of curiousity, I might have been about 13 or 14. After a couple of weeks of just messing about with it, I decided I wanted to really learn how to play. 

I found two books in my Dad's music collection.

Mel Bay's Guide, and Bob Dylan's Best of Songbook for Guitar

I learned how to play guitar by learning how to play Blowin' in the Wind. And Maggie's Farm. And The Time's They Are a-Changin'. And Like a Rollin' Stone. And Chimes of Freedom. And Knockin' On Heaven's Door. And Don't Think Twice. And so many more.

So many high school parties, sitting around playing Bob Dylan, (and a whole lot of other 60's hits, as those were the songbooks that my Dad had...it was a dark time, before the internet.) and having singalongs with good friends. Everyone knew Dylan, it was what our parents were listening to at home. Good times with good friends, and I still play many of those songs when I'm feeling a little homesick.

Happy Birthday, Bob. Thanks. 




 I'm no scientist either, but the one thing that I know is that a lot of what we are getting exposed to science-wise, isn't science at all, but a massive disinformation campaign. Both sides of the argument are guilty of this, but it seems like the pro-GMO side is skewing the science more than the whole food movement.

My family and i are going to err on the side of caution on this one, and are trying to limit our exposure to GMOs until more is known. 




 Probably use the same strings.
 




 To replace the nut, you will have to remove the strings completely. Depending on the type of guitar, this may cause some tension problems. You may want to have this pro repaired if you're not handy at guitar tech. 




 To check a pan of ground beef, when you think that it is close to being done (after the fat looks clearer, if you can tell that), scoot everything over to one side of the pan, and try to get a temp reading in the middle of the pile. Generally, with loose meat like ground beef, assuming that you're stirring and mixing, if one part is at 165 f, then all of it should be at temp. 




 Thermometers. [Here's a handy-dandy chart for you](http://www.extraordinarybbq.com/bbqbasics/meat-temperatures/), (That previous sentence is a link to it.) Covers the basics. Do some more research on temperature charts, and you should be okeydokey for the future.
 




 You have to stop what you're doing. Someone is going to catch you, and they might just fuck you up for your trouble. 




 Why allow the tornado in the first place? When I hear people say things like this, I hear the unmentioned comment that somehow they deserved saving, while there was a reason that everyone else was not. What did those kids do to god to piss him off? Or their parents, maybe? And so many, that were so evil, that god decided to save you, instead of them? 




 I play a pretty heavily wooded course as my home course as well, and the hardest thing that I had to learn is to not overreach. Sometimes your best shot is the shot that gets you out of the woods. Too many times have a thunked the second tree trying to make a shot that was harded to make than my drive was in the first place! 




 Simple laughter. I looked like a hairy man in a dress. But, my friend is not feminine at all, and he's happy when he's CD. (I think he looks like a dude in a dress, nice dress and all, but just a dude in a dress, but I can see that he is happy, and that's what matters most.) 




 Comfortable older male here, hetero, but with many life experiences that touch on some of these issues, and I consider myself well in touch with my sexuality.

 What do you think about the idea of wearing girls clothes, like a dress?

Personnally, doesn't do much for me. I have, in the past, on rare occasions, worn women's underwear (at the request of a gf). I found it fun, but partially because I knew that if she asked me to wear her underwear it meant that we were going to get funky later.

 What would you think if you saw yourself in the mirror dressed like a girl, and what feelings does this invoke?

I have seen myself in full women's clothes. (Halloween a couple of times, a couple of other times for other reasons, none sexual in nature) It was odd, to see myself that way, but there were no negative feelings, neither did I feel comfortable. I am a burly male type, and mostly I felt that I made for a really ugly girl.

 What do you think about the idea of having a feminine body? (i.e. having breasts, long girly hair, and a curvy, womanly body)

I have long hair. I have (fantasized is not the right word, freethinking is what I call it, just imagining for the sake of imagining, sort of) about having breasts, or a vagina, and experiencing what that would be like, both on a day to day basis, and in a sexual context. I am happy with my body, and wouldn't trade it for anything, but I would like the chance to be someone else, or some other sex for a period of time.

 What do you think about the idea of being socially accepted as a girl? (i.e. whether or not your looks change, everyone thinks of you as a girl)

I would not be comfortable identifying as a woman. 

 What do you think about the idea of having a vagina?

As a said above, I have thought of this, and I would enjoy it briefly, but wouldn't trade Big Jim Thesselwine and the Bullzac Twins for a vagina, not permanently.

 Also, this is mostly irrelevant to gender, but what feelings does the idea of performing fellatio from a man or receiving anal sex invoke? (This question is directed to heterosexual men, but others are welcome to answer)

I don't find the idea of performing fellation on a man exciting at all. Receiving anal from a man, I've thought about before. (I'm a pro-prostate/anal hetero) As far as I can tell without expermenting, which I don't intend to do, I am interested in it, but not from a man. (I may try letting my wife experiment with a strap-on) 

Outside of this, and I hope these answers help you somehow, I would just say that you got to get in touch with you, stop worrying so much about labels, and find what makes you happy. I have a good friend who identifies male, is hetero, and is at his happiest in a dress. Whatever makes his day, makes me happy, and the people that truly care about you will be happy when you are happy as well. 




 Nope. Only fairies can help other things fly, and only fairies have full open control of their flight. Some other living creatures when exposed to fairy dust have been able to self control, but others seemed to just levitate. (I would cite sources, but this conversation is weird enough.) Objects simply get lifted. 

(I always did like bad girls) 




 I too suffer through many Tink movies with my daughter. 

1. Yes, fairies need pixie dust to fly, but other creatures and inanimate objects need pixie dust to fly as well, but really should be that they need pixie dust to *levitate*, but let's forgive them as we are adults watching a show meant for little girls.

2. I also noticed this. It is a glaring inconsistency in the canon, and will not be forgiven.

(also, I'm a Vidia fan myself.) 




 
A great book, and a very campy movie. Read it/watch it, it doesn't hold up to comparison, but a good piece of disaster fiction, either way.

 




 This is just great photoshop.
 









 The next time that you give her oral, when you're done, go up and kiss her, and tell her how much you enjoy doing that for her. One, the girls like that sort of thing, being told that you like doing stuff to them, and two she can experience her own taste/smell and maybe see that there is not much to worry about, and seeing you not minding it all over your face will reinforce for her how much it totally doesn't bother you. 




 Um, nothing. 

Ice should be safe, but you really don't want to be storing things up there. That can lead to all sorts of problems. If you're looking for feeling full for a period of time, get a small plug you can wear while being out and about. 




 Who would have won if nuclear war broke out between US and USSR?

The cockroaches. 




 They make this. It's called superglue. Just a dab on the end of your fretting fingers, and it will give you some extra "callous". Remove with acetone (fingernail polish remover). DO NOT USE ACETONE WITH OPEN WOUNDS! (ouch) 




 Hmmm...might not be the best look for you, but maybe you should try that next time! Surprise her with nothing on but goggles and a snorkel.

In all seriousness, be careful of rubbing your eyes with your hands after sex. While all that juiciness is lots of fun, it does harbor some things that your eyes might not appreciate. 




 Um, I don't think you're doing it right? I don't usually use my eyes for anything more than looking....
 




 No prohibitions against ownership in the old west, but most towns would not let armed men ride down the high street. In town residents were sometimes restricted as to what they could own though.

It would be tough to come up with a statistical counter-argument to this graph, because I don't think you could do so without creating something as equally ambiguous. Gun crime is a very complex system, and much of the arguments being talked about rely on obscuring some of the real data, while heavily manipulating other parts of it. Maybe some research into background checks and how they affected gun violence? Everyone on either side of this argument is looking for the golden bullet point that will make the other side admit that they are wrong, but I don't think that it exists. The reality of gun violence has fingers in our education system, our social reality and values, our economic disparity, our culture, our history, and our emotions. 

[Here's an article that looks at the correlation between gun controls and gun violence from a different perspective.](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/04/03/1811311/study-states-with-loose-gun-laws-have-higher-rates-of-gun-violence/)

[Here's an article from the Joyce Foundation that takes on a couple pro gun myths, with lots of links to backcheck and factcheck.](http://www.joycefdn.org/gunviolencemyths/)

[A bit off your topic, but a good article on the difference between causation and correlation relating to the gun debate.](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/03/armed-correlations-gun-ownership-and-violence.html) 




 Okay. 

Let's start with the graph itself. What the hell is the left axis signifying? 2, 6, 8 what? Gun deaths per thousand? People who own guns? Number of alpacas in Maine?

From right to left...

The Wild West: First, the west was not so wild. Most towns had very strict gun controls. What we "know" of the wild west comes from movies. (Bonus: The gunfight at the OK corrall was about a gang that refused to be governed by gun laws!)

The Union Led Controls: This had a lot to do with reconstruction, not with gun violence. Many households were allowed to still have hunting rifles, but not military grade weapons. Doesn't really have too much to do with overall gun violence.

Prohibition: This makes sense, if you assume that the left axis actually means something. Violence was up during prohibition, and down after its repeal. But this violence was different than the overall homicide rate in the US now, again assuming that's what this graph is trying to represent. Big difference between machine gun Kelly taking out a rival gang and a husband shooting his wife for cheating.

Post JFK Controls: I don't know much about these.

War on Drugs: The increase makes sense, but why so much up and down? Is that related to the WoD at all? 

Carry laws: Curiously, these carry laws conincide with the general drop in crime that started in 1993. (The folks that wrote Freakonomics famously compared abortion rates with crime rates 20 years later and saw a very interesting correlation, look it up.) And not all states started issuing these permits. 

I call bullshit. Overall, I think it might have started as a real graph that contains real info, but to use it as a pro gun argument just because you can identify a few things on a timeline to defend your argument does not make a solid case. It certainly does not tell the whole story of gun violence. 




 I like my discs to be whatever color stands out from green/yellow/light brown...I play in Florida, and yellows and oranges and greens just disappear sometimes. As far as stamps, I'm a dyer, I like 'em not there!

 I think you already know the answer....take your man out and go buy new memories together. 




 Men are visually stimulated. That's why we like porn so much. It's our eyes that get turned on first. Additionally, it tells us a lot about you; how you enjoy to be pleasured, what works for you. We can use that...whether for information, or just to save to the spank bank. 




 Yes, yes you can. We call those Twice Crispy Treats!
 




 Mmmmmm....language porn.
 




 I work in foodservice, and I always wash...when I'm at work. The reasoning behind it does make sense. It's not just peeing on yourself; some bacteria and/or viruses can migrate. Either from your poo, or if you're a carrier.

Saying that, the idea of washing your hands when you're done in the bathroom is the idea of *everyone* washing their hands when they're done. A good way to help ensure that infectious diseases don't spread.

At home, no, I don't wash everytime I pee; only when I piss on myself. (And that's just a "grossness" issue, urine is sterile) I know I'm clean and disease free, and take care to remain so.

ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS wash after dumping. 




 Half rice crispies, and half other cereal. I've used fruity pebbles, cocoa pebbles, broken up cap'n crunch.

Also, coating in chocolate is good...laying a bed of chocolate down before you put your crispies in is better...then top with caramel. 




 I think that products like this don't appeal to me for two reasons. One, don't like to think about menstruation. The menses are a completely natural biological process that all women experience during their reproductive lives, but it is something that men experience second hand, and it is both mystical and clinical when described to us. We don't know how to deal with women menstruating as men, and as a society, we still view this part of a woman's life as dirty, or gross.

Secondly, living in a disposable society, the idea of washing these out and reusing them relates to that dirtiness aspect, and we have been trained our whole lives to view certain things as dirty, and disposables can take the stigma away, by never having to think about it.

I'm a dude, and yes I find that idea gross, but as a member of spaceship Earth, I know how detrimental disposables pads/tampons are to the environment, and if my wife wanted to use something like this, I would support it. Easier to deal with this than the [Mooncup](http://www.mooncup.co.uk/about-the-mooncup.html) anyway you look at it though!

 Frustrating....I'm looking for full results as well. Nothing yet. 




 Played regular Thursday club round this morning in pouring rain/wind.  




 I was a dedicated diet soda drinker. I stopped as part of my weight loss plan for this year. I've been eating better and excercising, but I assume that stopping the diet sodas was a big part of weight gain. Why? I lost so much weight at first, and fast, when I made these changes. And more importantly, the change in how I feel was amazing.

Saying that, if you're only drinking three a week, just stop. Find your caffeine in coffee, or tea, where you can control how much (and maybe more importantly *what kind of*) sugar you put in them. I personally would recommend staying away from diet sodas just because you don't want to find them becoming too large a part of your diet, but at the level that you're drinking, it shouldn't matter.  




 Lots of my favorites on there. 

Huck Finn - Mark Twain. Gotta love Twain. I don't think it's his best work, I like his essays and short stories, but he tells a tale well, and it's easy to read.

White Fang - London. The ultimate boys adventure book. I think that this one is a bit of a "young reader" i.e. not much to it, but a great read, great story.

Brave New World - Huxley. I think that this is a "must read" especially if you're politically minded at all. Put it on your list to read, but don't do it for this assignment unless you're looking to impress. Tough subject, very involved.

The World According to Garp - Irving. Another great story. A big read, but not impossible to communicate the story to a class. (Also a great movie, with Robin Williams in a serious role.)

They're really all good. I've read 90% of these recreationally, but I don't know what you're looking for for your assignment. Good luck, happy reading. 




 Having a great round at my local park, shooting well.

Throw a drive out of bounds left. Pissed. Working on my drive, been getting better, know I can do better. Throw a provisional, for practice.

Out of bounds right.

Topped with barbed wire.

That encloses a lake.

Panic.

Find disc, newest and current favorite (a banana yellow amp with a custom dye) laying juuuussst next to lake, behind fence.

 Crispy clear film around the edges sounds like your pan might be just a tad too hot. Try turning down the heat and cooking slower. 




 I'm glad you were able to fix it. 

One of my earliest memories is my dad being upset at me because I hadn't cleaned my toys up in the hallway, and him stomping on and breaking my Hess truck and trailer with real light up lights. (If you're over 35 you know what I'm talking about)

Dad and I have lots of other reasons why our relationship is garbage, but my mind always goes back to that.

Talk to your wife.  




 State the situation? I wouldn't be very comfortable going down on a girl at the dinner table, at her parents house, during Thanksgiving dinner...but if it's a sexytime situation, I'm a-goin down faster than the stock market two years ago.

My age now? When I did it the first time? How old she is? Very confused. This is something that I did in probably my second or third sexual encounter, almost 30 years ago now. And she would have to be older than 18. 




 It's a poem. Semi-famous in its day. It's actualy title is Old Pothead's Experimental Method. It's by Sam Abrams, a college professor and Fulbright scholar.

From Dr. Lester Grinspoons' blog:

Sam Abrams has been a Fulbright Professor of American Literature at the University of Athens and currently is Professor of Language and Literature in the College of Liberal Arts, Rochester Institute of Technology. He dropped out of academia from 1968 to 1978, during which time he was a film writer, a communal organic farmer, a casual longshoreman, a union laborer, and a public relations flack: he considers that of these, the farming was the best learning experience.

The poem was originally published in The Old Pothead Poems.

Here's his [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_abrams) 




 I've recently read an article about birthgasms here on reddit. Have you experienced this, and is it difficult for women to talk about when it happens? 




 Doo doo do do do. 




 Yeah, thanks, no spell check. I'm lost without it. 




 This might be part of the phenomenom as well. Testing has improved greatly over the last twenty-five years or so and we're better able to identify allergies that aren't of the *eat a peanut and die* flavor. 




 We take allergy awareness very serious in our restaurants. We have a clientele made up of mostly old folks, who are in the danger zone when it comes to food bourne illnesses and allergies. I understand making it idiot proof on the menus to some degree, but when a case of cashews comes in the back door to be stocked and I see a big sticker that says Warning: CONTAINS NUTS it makes me wonder what sort of stupidity had to happen to make the manufacturer have to put that on there.  




 I've done a lot of reading on this, and fingers point to everything under the sun. Personnally I believe that there is a connection between food additives and food allergies. There is little to no direct evidence showing this, but food allergies have grown in our society right along with the massive increase of artificial colorings and flavorings, with the increase of steriod and antibiotic use, and the increased reliance on pesticides/herbicides in our industrial farming.

Exposure, or lack of exposure, may be an issue as well, as many children that develop food allergies come from homes that eat a diet heavy in processed foods, so that the exposure that they do get to the common allergens (wheat/gluten, soy, dairy, eggs, fish/shellfish, and treenuts) are processed so much. Again, there is little evidence, or studies, that point to this as a cause.

I don't have the link, but I did read about a study that showed that children who were fed a whole food diet were the most unlikely to form any food allergies at all, and when the mother consumed a whole foods diet as well, the chance of food allergies became almost nil. 

It's incredibly difficult to get good information about our food anymore. The foxes are running the henhouse as it were, with the government authorities who are in charge of making sure our food is safe, true, and healthful are run by industry executives across the board. There is less monitoring in our food service manufacturing now than at any time since the early 1970's, and that directly correlates with the increase in food bourne illnesses that have sickened and killed people in these last 40 years.

 




 I work in the foodservice industry, and am in charge of producing allergy information menus for our restaurants. Food allergies are growing in leaps and bounds, and it's important to get correct information to our customers so that they can avoid allergens, and so that we can avoid lawsuits.

Saying that, it makes me crazy to have to point out that a peanut butter and jelly sandwich contains nuts. 

I understand pointing out hidden gluten, or eggs, or shellfish in recipes that the customer might not automatically assume were there, but if you have a nut allergy, then "Don't eat nuts!" seems like pretty good advice. Do you really need a warning? 




 Bastards. Assuming the story checks out that is. If it was me, I would be turning on Daddy Kick Ass Power, and probably be going to jail in addition to losing my kid. I hope they get out of this without too much more nonsense. 




 Go for it. The wife and I enjoy that one, gives the female a feeling of control, of dominance, she can grab my head, twist my ears, and fuck my face for a change! 




 He's asking because he wants you to do it...so he doesn't have a problem with it. He obviously finds you sexy and attractive....so who's judging you but you?

Turn the lights out, or compromise; through a leg up on the couch and put him to work. 




 No, because I've done it. There's so many benefits from ideas like these. Spices things up for sure, shows an adventurous side, and the learning, if you can keep your head and pay attention, is invaluable. 




 You need to ask your woman, not Reddit. 

Go to her. Now. Tell her hot fuckin' hot it was to watch her finish herself off. Tell her that whenever she's ready and comfortable that you would like to pay more attention to her masturbating so you could see what it is that she likes. Follow through. Take fuckin' notes. 

Sex is a strange thing; most of us can do it, but only a few of us take the time to get really freakin' good at it. 




 I make most of my decisions based on human interaction with a possible employee, but adding what I can find online can help me get a better overall picture of the person that I'm talking to, and direct some questions that might get them to open up about themselves. 

I have once in the past confused two people because of similar names, but most of the time I do the online check almost immediately after talking to someone so I can use all the info that I have to make sure that I'm stalking the right person.

I don't agree that google searching in this useage is because of cowardice, but more because we live in a world where people share more of themselves online than when in person, especially with a stranger. Stalking out their digital profile is no substitute for social interaction, but it is a wealth of information when you're trying to make a decision about someone that you just met.

 




 I caught that, and appreciate it.  




 I didn't say that, but I would look to see if I could infer what your recreational drug of choice would be. Big difference between a pothead and a meth-head. 




 It wouldn't be too hard to put the two together...but I'm also not currently looking for a job! I would delete a whole lot of Reddit and Facebook and others first thing before beginning a job search.  




 That is an issue. Hard to prove though, unless the employer is stupid enough to either admit that they check FB as part of the decision making process, or something equally as stupid...admitting that they don't hire pregnant atheist muslims. 




 I keep a "real name" social media site, and a real one for my real friends. Makes things a little easier, unless I forget to give out the right one to the wrong person. 




 It's not always easy. But most of the time I get an applicants social # or email as well, adn that can narrow things down as well. Middle names help with common names as well, so does knowing how to use Facebooks terrible search function. 




 That's why I like it here. 




 Manson is actually a well-spoken and intelligent guy. Look up some of his interviews; he's far more than his public persona. Hate his music, but I think I would have a nice time chatting with him.

The Biebs, however, I get the impression that he's as one dimesional as it gets without being in geometry class. I don't think he has a thing to offer anyone, outside of his inevitable dissapperance. 




 I'm surprised when someone doesn't have a facebook page, or when I can't find one (nicknames or fake names on page) but a simple google search gives me a wealth of information to sift through. When you fill out your app, I have your full name (check arrest records, check for other social media sites), I have your address (check out where you live to get an idea of your previous income and current financial situation), and I have your past employers (google search employees name plus previous employer can sometimes turn up any positive or negative feedback, either posted by the applicant, or by a supervisor, coworker, or customer). 

You'd be surprised how much you can find out. Try it on yourself, or a friend that you have that info on, and see what's public out there. I do, once every couple of months, just to see what my digital profile is like. 




 This is how and why terrorism works. As soon as I saw the bombs go off my first thought was for the victims, but immediately following was concern about how my government was going to react.

Though to be true to form, once we found out that the bombers were Chechen, we should have invaded Switzerland. 




 Add alliteration:

"Soon I'll be stopping *by* to grab my things and say good*bye*" 




 Were they weighing themselves before and after puking? Seeing how many pounds of sex toys they could insert at once? You throw confusing parties....I like that. 




 As an employer, I would never ask for your fb password. But, you should know that I absolutely will check your facebook when considering you for a position. Protect yourself! When looking for a job, ensure that your profile is set to private, and that I can't see photos of you using illegal drugs, complaining about how messed up your financial situation is, or comments that show you are a racist/sexist/militant/etc. 




 Welcome to the 21st century. Douche. Change your handle, you're giving atheists a bad name.

Do some experimentation with searching (your ingredients) flavor wheel. It's a handy tool, and good for inspiration as well. 




 I've read Borimi's comments on this, which are well thought out and better written than my response. What I mean by not so much about slavery might have been better said as not only or not specifically about slavery. Bormimi puts it quite well when he says "slavery wasn't the spark which started the war, it is the overwhelming common denominator underlying the factors which caused the war."

I don't think that Lincoln used slavery as *only* a foreign policy tool, but it certainly was used that way. 

I agree totally that any argument that you have about the Civil War are going to be wrapped up in the cloak of slavery, the states rights issue was about the states individual rights to have slaves or not. When I hear people say that the Civil War was about slavery, I envision Lincoln as some sort of super hero swooping in to free the slaves, and I don't think that history really bears that out. This could easily degenerate into an argument (It's **State's Rights!!**, no, it's the **State's rights to keep slaves!!**) but I just wanted to express that slavery wasn't the *reason*, but obviously it was the underlying current that this particular piece of history swims in.


 




 I thought they were all good ones.

 




 Justification in war is generally decided by the victors, who often write the history.

Slavery. Not so much. Lincoln believed that blacks should have equal rights, even though he was on record as saying that he believed they were lesser beings than whites. Short answer? Slavery was a tool that was used by Lincoln and his White House when trying to prevent foreign powers getting involved in the Civil War. Other countries had already outlawed or curtailed slavery throughout most of the industrialized world, and by making the war about slavery, other countries had to consider how they would be perceived supporting a rebellion that was about the right to keep slaves. The civil war was started in ideation because the states wanted to have self-determination, while the Fed Gov't felt that it could overrun states rights in certain instances, *such as slavery*.



Preserving the Union was far more important than slavery itself. Preserving the Union might as well have been political code for 1, I'm not gonna go down as the president that lost the south, and 2, we can't exist comfortably without the food and materiel that the South provides. (Textiles, tobacco, raw cotton, and many foodstuffs.) The industrial North would have to import all those things from what would become a foreign country.

Let's use Syria as an example. It doesn't matter as much what happens during the war as the result. If Assad wins, and continues his reign, what will be remembered a hundred years from know is how a brave and beleagured Assad was able to hold off the rebel hourdes and defend his country against those that wished it harm. If the rebels win....history will be theirs to define. 




 Own it. It's yours. Especially if you're good at it. Bassists and guitarists are a dime a dozen (and you get two bassists free with any purchase) but a banjo picker that knows what he's doing is worth a damn or two. 




 It's perfectly fine as is, because it is. This man likes to see that chocolate starfish standing out from the rest of your buttskin. No woman should want to take that simple pleasure away from us. In fact, why don't you look into dyeing Sauron's eye a darker color! Make your balloon knot a dark purple! Embrace your puckered starfish! Celebrate your ham flower! Love your rusty bullet hole!

 Had a lady at one of the high-tops near the bar tonight. Ordered a Stoli and water. Complained about it "not tasting right". Shot on over to do my thing, talked to her, the only thing she could say is that it "just didn't taste right". So I go to the bar and have the 'tender make me another one, stood right there and saw it get made. Took it over to the table and presented it to the customer. She says that it tastes just like the last one!

I tell the lady that I stood there and saw it get made, and that I was sure that it was Stoli and water. 

She says that she's had them before, and it doesn't taste like she remembers.

After mentally thowing my hands in the air, I restated that I was sure that it was Stoli and water, just like she ordered...

She asked me what flavor of Stoli that I used. 




 Late tonight, had a trio of old white folks walking out the door just as an african-american couple walked in. Little old lady, about 80, maybe five feet tall, walks right up to the black fella, probably 6'8, grabs his belly and tells him "You look just like my son!" Without explaining why this makes sense, they ask him (of course) if he played basketball. Turns out he played for UCF, and the litle old lady says that her son also played for UCF, years earlier than this guy would have been in school. After chatting basketball for a minute or two more, they went their seperate ways, and I caught the eye of the big guy, and he kinda rolled his eyes at me. The little old lady turns to her husband as they walk out the door and says...

"6'8 and he played power forward? He's fulla shit!"

Surreal.
 









 Sex outside the bedroom can be very cool. The wifey and I are all middle aged and shit and still like gettin' it on in sketchy semi-public places. We have a date with a park down the road next Monday afternoon actually....gonna do some "bird watchin'".  




 Maybe by his room-mate? Either way, that's one hell of a walk of shame. 




 Just a quick run like that, might be best to put an ad in our [local newspaper want ads](http://creative.news-journalonline.com/classified/) or in our local trashrag, [the Pennysaver](http://www.floridapennysavers.com/new_smyrna_beach/). Short of that, the only service that I know of that you could possibly use are more of a booze cruise/charter boats that are gonna run 50-100 bucks, and stay out for a few hours. 




 Fixing is my thing, and the additional income could come from purchasing the rental property...but I see what you're saying. Can't make a play on it for lack of funds....love my place, hate to think about leaving. 




 We've got another six months or so on our current lease, and the landlord situation is a little, let's say unprofessional. Landlord that we deal with has sold the property previously, to a family member, who does not live in town. Current landlord makes all the decisions, and is the kind of guy that would work with emotion first, and economics second...having another lease drawn wouldn't be a big deal, I think, as long as the sale wasn't imminent.

I didn't figure I could do anything to try and secure the property, but I would be a dope for not asking!

Want to get this figured out so that we can make long term plans. Doing credit counseling/building up our credit score...we do have a long term plan to buy, we just are worried about how soon we may have to move, and what that will do to our finances.

Thanks for replying! 




 San Marino burned down or something, didn't it? The new Malibu condo is there, or next door? 




 There's an encampment behind the Indian River plaza, but other than that, don't really see them like I see them on Canal. 




 We just found out that our landlord is putting our building up for sale. It's a three unit condo, beachside, 1650 sqft or so per, 3/2, brick and mortar. Our landlord has been very friendly for us, keeping us in our unit for less (way less) than market value. (We pay 1k/mth, going rate should be 1500 or so, if not higher.) 

We're concerned with new owners coming in, where we live is developing and growing, and we're just not sure what our plans, long and short term, should be.

So, a couple things you guys could answer for us?

Short term: Three unit, priced at 400K. Property is zoned res only. Possible income about 4500/mth or so. How quick is this thing gonna sell. I know you don't have crystal balls over there, and the market in FL is rebounding, but still shaky, but does this sound like a clearance sale to you, or are we going to have a minute before we have to worry about it selling?

Mid Term: What are my rights as a renter? Assuming this place does sell, how long do I have before the new landlords can demand higher rents, or demand we vacate? Do they purchase any lease agreements when they purchase the property? Meaning, do they have to honor a lease signed by the previous owner? (This is important, our landlord is *very* cool, and if our plans needed to include us staying there, he could set us up with a lease for three or five years, at our rate, with no fee for early vacating.)

Long term: What's our next step? Single wage earner, paycheck to paycheck, minimal savings, minimal credit history. Is it even worth it to start looking for a home to buy, or should we be looking at another rental? (Info: Income (on paper) 40k/yr, own investment property only worth about 10k, about 5k in savings currently, both wife and I have *ahem, questionalble credit....(default credit card - her, and student loans - me.))

Thanks in advance for anything you guys can suggest to ease our minds and help us plan our future! And, I hesitate to ask because it seems so far fetched, but is there something like a Small Business Loan that I could get hold of (if I could even qualify for such a thing) and make a play at the property ourselves? 




 Thank you!! This is why I reddit! 




 Interesting place. A wide spot on the road....I-75, just north of Tampa. Was hitching out of Tallahassee one summer, and got picked up outside Lutz by a dude and his family in a short bus that had been upconverted to a camper bus. Spent the whole hour and a half ride into St. Pete listening to this dude explain how magic crystals could be ground up, dropped from planes into the atmosphere, and that would prevent hurricanes from ever forming again. He had some very convincing pictures, drawn in pencil on notebook paper, that explained how it worked. He was very adamant about how it needed to happen, but it never was going to...."because of the niggers and the gays."
A ride I was glad I was still alive to see the end of. I made eye contact with the wife on my way off the bus, and I couldn't tell if I saw pity for me, either because I had to talk to her crazy old man, or because I didn't understand how magic crystals worked, or maybe, just maybe, a pleading look, begging for help, some rescue unlooked and unhoped for from her madman of a husband.

She haunts my dreams. 




 Shhhhh! I'm trying to get more cool people to come to Florida! 

Been through Polk. It's no different than most of middle FL. Ever been to Lutz? 




 Yeah, that's gonna be hard to do. Depends on what kind of frisbee you want to do. Simple recreational frisbee easier than a regulation Ultimate or Disc golf disc. (Because of the plastic blends used in manufacture.)  




 Yeah, no career as a travel agent for me. 




 It's basically all the parts of FL that aren't advertised. Orlando? Crack heads, murder capital of FL. Tampa/St. Pete? Meth. Robbery. Rape. Clearwater Beach? Ought to call it hypodermic beach, also the headquarters of Scientology. Panama City Beach? The beach is nice, the rest of the panhandle is backwards southern rednecks. Miami? They'll eat your face off, but only *after* they rape you.  




 Some parts of it aren't that bad. No, really. 




 English and spanish, from FL. 




 Post here...lots of new dads, and second and third dads here. Also, get your wife a copy of What to Expect When You're Expecting, and read it yourself. Great book, very informative. 




 What's the design? (How difficult?) Single color, or mutliple? 




 I'm a rocks drinker. A good whiskey, poured over ice, swirled, allowed to sit just a minute or two before enjoying, is a delight. I personally don't "add" any water, other than my melty ice. 




 Ahhh, rape-dancing. It was very popular in my high school. 




 Our home course is short, technical one. We warm up on 18, no practice baskets. Practice upshots from the basket at 18 to the basket on hole 9...got to talking to some club members, and we talked about doing a day where we shoot from the previous hole's basket on to the next hole. (Hole out 1, and then shoot from that spot for 2, and so on.) Would work for our course, and sounds like a lot of fun. We may try it soon. 




 If there's a downside to playing disc golf in FL, besides the unbearable heat, how much water you have to carry, bugs, spiders, alligators, and wind/rain/hurricanes, it's that you have some real interesting ground cover colors....I throw a lot of white and black and blue discs to make sure I can see them in the green, greenish yellow, yellow, brownish yellow and brown we play in.
 




 All year disc golf in FL...but getting ready for windy spring early summer with this:

Driver(s):

171g Champ Beast (beat in, forearm go to disc. Reaching just shy of 300 with this.)

172g Champ Beast (softer beat in, back hand control disc. Right about 300')

177g Champ Beast (newest, throwin in the wind. Can boom this one a bit further.)

177g River (glide like an eagle, headwind or tailwind. Love this disc. Can hit 275-300')

178g Amp (newest disc, not sure if right for my windy bag)

Mids:

175g Champ Shark (Beat in, forearm approach and finesse disc)

180g Champ Shark (softer beat in, for shot shaping and longer approaches)

Putts:

2X Anodes, 180 and 178 




 That, sir, is fuckin' creepy.
 




 I whistle, happy tunes, and smile and say hi to everyone that I see....generally helps. But, I still get "the look" every now and again. 




 I hope so, it's getting re-reported too much. 




 It was announced today that Andrew Lincoln may be quitting the show. That might change a few things. 




 Survivors.

 Married three years, together 10 more.

I would at least consider it, and talk to her about it. The issue wouldn't necessarily be sex, but I would want to know that there were some emotional protections in place. (Not worried about her fuckin' somebody else as I am her fallin' in love with somebody else.) 




 When you want your haircut, you go to the barber.

When you want your teeth cleaned, you go to the dentist.

When you want your balls drained, why on earth wouldn't you go to a professional?

And you had to go to the barber the first time, and you were probably scared then. You had to go to the dentist the first time, and that was probably scary, too.

Do what feels right for you. But don't cloud up this decision with a lot of nonsense. Do it if you want. Don't if you don't. Whoever she is, she's done this before. She'll be gentle. And understanding, and won't make fun of you.

My opinion? I lost my virginity to a girl just a year older than me that (if it's even possible) knew less about sex than I did. The idea of your first time being special is mostly a myth. It's usually a misinformed fumbling occasion marked by unneeded embarassment and stickyness.

 




 For sure. 




 Nowhere near that fast, but a fun story.

I had been playing with a couple people on and off, shitty bar gigs, whatever. Didn't work out, drifted, lost contact.

My friend (percussionist) and I moved, out of state for work and school.

We ended up working at the same shithole restaurant, and one night after work, we're sitting around outside, having a ...smoke, and my friend says fuck it, we should start a band. 

Work sucks, extra money doesn't, but we laughed it off, we don't know anybody in town, blah blah blah. 

My buddy (percussionist) and I (singer/songwriter/guitar) are catching a ride home that night with this dude, and dude says we have to stop by his place to ...have a smoke.

We roll into his apartment, and there is this red-headed fuck sleeping on the couch. He wakes up when he hears us moving around in the kitchen, and it's my buddy from the other state (lead guitar) that we haven't seen in about two years.

First words outta his mouth? We need to start a band.

We jam a few times, nothing really, and start thinking about finding a bass player. We get this guy over, and he's some kind of jazz/fusion guy that can't fit with southern progrock, and after deciding he ain't working, my buddy (lead guitar) says that he thinks he know someone. 

Give him a call, he lives two streets over from the band house. He says he knows a drummer. They both come over.

We all work on a jam, hits that sweet spot where you can feel it right, and for the next six years we make beautiful music together, scorching the scene in our little town.

Serendipity was considered for a band name. 




 I did not even consider smart-people only orgies. I may just start organizing those, and to hell with the birth control. 




 Birth Control in the water.

You gotta have a license to fish, but anybody with a vagina and a donor can have a kid?

In the face of severe overpopulation just a generation or two away, and idea like this could be revolutionary.

Consider that Russian scientists have announced that they may be able to "curtail againg" by 2050 or so, and most scientists agree that the human lifespan is going to skyrocket in the next 100 years or so.

Consider that in many parts of the world, absolutely no care is given to our genetics. Any body can breed. Maybe this isn't the best idea? Given that many of our best and brightest are too busy to start families, and it's the portion of our society that least needs to be breeding that seems to be the most productive at it.

Birth Control in the water. Go to the doctor, get a physical, get screened for genetic diseases, get a license, go to the pharmacy, take a pill that makes you fertile, have children.

The singlemost large problem with this idea is that some government has to be in charge of this, and that's almost never a good idea. But something has to be done, or not only will we overpopulate, we will be surrounded by the worst that society has to offer us. 




 It's not gonna make you feel any better about almost eating that, but that's a piece of common dish room scrubby made of steel. Real common for those to end up in pots and pans, that are then used for cooking, and the piece of metal makes it into your food. Our restaurant does not allow them any longer for that reason. 




 There was a point where I wanted to like Merle, I really did. He came close to some kind of redemption...but even there at the end I didn't trust him...I think that he might have been doing what he was doing just to gain cache with Rick's group, or maybe I'm just jaded as hell. 




 Yeah, that'll happen. 




 Such a powerful scence, but I for one am glad to see Merle gone.
 




 One of my favorite places...lol. Tacos carnitas for the win...shitty wine based margaritas, though. The family hits that place up once a month or so...I'm a chef/manager, so I like to eat at home as often as possible. :) One of the best joints on beachside, and just a bit down the road from my house.  




 In between the bikers and the breakers (Spring break starts on the heels of bike week) this is the least favorite time of year here for me. Another month or so, and things get nice around here. Good summer crowd, but they stick to the beach, and the bars are crowded, but not with assholes, ya know? Just interesting folks. Next to early fall (when everyone goes home and the town is empty) summer is my favorite time of year here. 




 Norwood's is still there. I've been here a bit, and I don't know the San Marino at all. You wouldn't recognize beachside...condos, condos as far as the eye can see...almost all the way down to Canaveral National Seashore. 
 




 You should have been here for the Casey Anthony nonsense....you would have loved it, and forgive me for my yankee comment. Most transplants are from up north, I just get used to calling 'em all yankees. 

As far as Warnos goes, did you see the Discovery Channel mini-doc on that case? The woman who played Wornos is the wife of one of my good friends and ex-employees, and is also a retired *original* American Gladiator!

Bike week is pure hell for most of us down here. Fake ass bikers with creases in their leathers, taking a vacation from their podiatrist practice to come play big boy in my little town...most of them don't know how to drive well anyway...cruisin' at three in the morning, knowing that they're the same people calling the cops when someone in their neighborhood is playing their radio too loud at nine at night...sheesh. Rant over 




 Biased opinion for sure, but they really are the best steaks in town. Real wood grill, imported mesquite from TX, nice bar, best happy hour in town, it's not a bad place.  The NSB can be great. It gets better when all the (no offense...) yankees go home. (Don't worry, give it a few weeks and you'll be on island time too.) 




 Okay...never go to the Outback again...keep going down the road to the Publix plaza on the right hand side. There's a local steakhouse there. (Full disclaimer: I work there...it's a job, so I hate it, but it really is the best steak in town.) Called the New Smyrna Steakhouse. Enjoy! 




 Careful, or you'll get to watch that crane eat those lizards! Not the best thing before breakfast! Manatee is awesome, we take the kids there every now and again. (We're true islanders...we generally don't come across the bridges if we don't have to...lol). On your cruise down Canal, just off Canal St on Sams Rd is the NSB historical museum. If you're into that sort of thing it's a neat little place with some history about our groovy little town. 




 Canal St. can be alright. Check out Ruth's for breakfast...skip it for lunch. (Ruthies is on the west end of canal...don't know which side you're on.) Big Joe's on the corner of Dixie Hwy and Canal for the best subs in town, or check out Maloney's for lunch and cold beer. (Ask for Michelle, tell her Joe sent ya) Feel free to PM me for anything NSB related....I love our little beach town. I've been here less than a decade, but I've grown to love this place, and know it well. 




 Welcome! Glad to have another Redditor in the NSB. Bums in your yard? Should have chosen beachside!

Cool things to do in NSB? Meh... Drive on the beach, do it at least once, then never do it again, it'll wreck your car.

Check out the lighthouse at Ponce Inlet. Long drive, small admission, worth it for the view.

South end of the island is part of Canaveral Natl Seashore. Go there. It's stunning.

Lots of park, and outside stuffs to do. I second Beachside Tavern for good shows. Cheap, and cold, beers too. 




 That's exactly what's its like. The chopstick is the structure to support all the hot glue. Shaping the glue is more like layering the glue. Adding in seperate layers to get the shapes that you want. It's easier than it sounds...I've made a fairy one for my five  year old girl, and a wizard one for my eight year old boy. Super easy, done in an evening, and I made hand-made paper boxes for them as well. 




 Prepare to be awesome, Dad.

Homemade Magic Wand/Princess Wand/Fairy Wand/Wizard Wand

You will need:

* Wooden chopsticks, like from the chinese takeout.

* A glue gun. Glue too.

* Spray paint. Pink, green, yellow, brown, you know.

* Sparkly shit. Glitter, ribbon, beads.

* Just a little bit of time.

Break off your chopsticks so you only have one. Get yer glue gun, and start gluing. What you need to do here is use the glue to shape the chopstick into a wand shape. Nice and thick on one end for little hands, dull down the sharpness of the skinny end so nobody loses an eye. Use beads or broken pieces of the other chopstick to help this shaping. Just build glue on top of glue until you get the look you want. (Pro-tip: Using wax paper, or latex gloves, you can mold the glue. But only right in between it being magma hot and completely set.) Once you get a shape that you're happy with, get your spray paint on, hit it with a couple of colors, make it bright, make it right. Brown for wizards/witches, pink and green for fairies and princesses. Get sparkly. Sprinkle glitter on that thang while it's still spray paint wet. Tie a ribbon around that thing. Personalize, accesorize, right? Go the extra mile and box it up all fancy-like, and prepare for the awesomeness of "Thank you Daddy!"

 




 Male in 10+ LTR.

She does if I ask. Not a huge thing for me, I prefer her nekkid. But I do like it when she does. Would like it more if it was spontaneous from her end, but if it's something that you want, don't just ask for it, talk to your girl and see how she feels about it, tell her how you feel about it, and see what happens. 




 I don't need it bald, but as a frequent giver of oral, I really appreciate when the girls keep everything neat and trim and out of my way...makes my life just a little bit easier. I can deal with hairy, I just prefer not having to. Bald is porn hot, but not necessary all the time. 




 Here in the US, cilantro refers to the leaves of the plant, while coriander generally refers to the ground up seeds of the same plant. Two very different flavors in the kitchen.  




 Real books will always have a place on my shelf, and I assume that there are a lot of other people that feel the same way.

What I would like to see in the future is a serious on-demand printing based book economy....where we don't have to choose from the few books that the publishers feel like producing, but can audition books online, and purchase printed copies of the books that we like, books that we have loved and lost, and eliminate the idea of a book ever being "out of print." 




 Girl is trying to do something, good for her, I ain't gonna hate. 




 Yep. Don't use RIT. They changed their formula a bit ago, and it no longer works on plastics. (Though, I have had some success in darkening colors with black RIT...). 

Find Jacquard iDye poly fabric dye. You can find it in Micheal's or online. Mix one pack with one quart of water, heat to boiling, let cool until you can hold your hands on the pot without hurting yourself, and dye away. Do not use the color intesifier that comes with the dye. 

Also, check out [the forums on DGCourseReview.com.](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=25) Plenty of info there. 

Happy coloring! 




 There are two sides to studying how to be a pick-up artist. 

The first side are those men that use those tools to bed women indiscriminately. They're in it for the game, for the conquer, and for the nookie. Many of them are the kind of guys that aren't going to call you in the morning; you are just another score to them.

But there's another side to studying how to be ultra-confident around women. It's for those of us that aren't. Many men have the tools to be a good partner to women whether it's for the long term, or just the long night, but they don't know how to act around the opposite sex, or lack the confidence in themselves to be that suave guy that we're all told we're supposed to be.

Studying the art of the pick up can help those kind of men show women that they are more than the quiet guy in the corner, making eyes at the hottie 'cross the way; it can help them be interesting, to conquer the art of small talk, and break down the walls between strangers that keep them from becoming closer.

tldr? Don't hate the player, hate the game. 




 I had a good friend while I was living in a university town. She was finishing her Master's and working at the restaurant that I ran.

I had many enjoyable evenings talking to her about politics, the future of genetics (her field of study), and general sciency stuff. She was a very intelligent, very well spoken young lady.

Until the men came around.

I had no interest in her, she none in me, purely friends, but the way that she would act when men she was interested in made it very difficult to remain friends with her. She could go from an intelligent discourse on current events, to that high-pitched-voice, flounce-my-hair play stupid bullshit that so many young women seem to employ.

I talked about it with her one time, and she felt that many men felt threatened by how smart she was. I responded that I thought she was smarter than that, and that the only men threatened by smart women are dumb men.

We've gone our seperate ways since, and I still see her on FB occiasionally, and it doesn't seem like much has changed. She's working on her Doctoral at another university, and her comments/posts seems to show that her intelligence has only grown, while the pictures that she posts, and the FB friends that she keeps reinforce that "dumb girl" facade.

tl;dr smart girls acting dumb to get beefneck men that will never respect a strong intelligent woman. 




 I am a gentleman in public, but a master in the bedroom.
