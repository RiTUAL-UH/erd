 The US air drops around Kobane resulted in 20% of the weapons going to IS. The US weapons to the "moderate" groups have resulted in 2 of 12 moderate groups defected - with TOWs and other weapons - to Nusra (similar to IS). US weapons to Sahwa (The Sunni Awakening) are also now firmly in IS hands with the mass executions.

Basically, along with the weapons given to the Iraqi army that IS looted over the past months, we've effectively armed the people we've declared war against - supposedly for a good reason. It's just been one epic fuck up. 




 Do you have a source for your attribution to Muhammad? Khwarijj were a group of sectarians with the explicit belief that commission of the kabair is tantamount to apostasy. You can throw the title around in a derogatory way, but it doesn't apply technically to these guys. In fact, the closest existing sect to the Khawarij would be the Ibadis in Oman... 




 They also separated the Christians. Christians and Sunnis were free to leave. 




 You will get downvoted. This sub is a cess-pool of armchair generals with a hard-on for the any and all current international conflicts. 




 That video of them pleading for help sure was convenient for the SAA 




 Very appropriate music video to go along with announcing these:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY0WxgSXdEE 




 **Abdulaziz bin Khalifa al-Attiyah was found guilty in absentia by a Lebanese court of channelling financial support to al-Qaeda.**

Sounds legit /s 




 I'm not really qualified to have a real discussion on the topic. My only contention was that its not as simple as declaring all new celebrations prohibited (opinion held by some of mashayakh you quoted) - since there is valid ikhtilaf on whether the celebration is religious or secular in nature. I can't speak to Halloween, Mother's day, birthdays or national holidays specifically. 




 Also muslims had the disgusting habit of making eunuchs out of their male slaves.

Maybe. Deliberate castration is explicitly prohibited in Islam however so the carry-over cultural practice really has nothing to do with them being Muslim. 




  All their "state building" initiatives need to bombed too IMO.

Yes - collective punishment is the way to go. Let's teach those average Sunnis for using the resources provided by the fighting groups that control their cities /s 




 Something that doesn't make sense about the video is that it looks homegrown, not one of the well-edited videos usually produced by this group. The group instituted a treason-policy on people recording "your brothers" on film without state apparatus - right?  




 I'm not going to give a value judgement on the concept, but happy to explain it. What your right hand posses is a reference to female slaves of age.

Although Muhammad encouraged the freeing of adult slaves in general, Islam doesn't completely prohibit slavery. That doesn't mean slavery in Islam is anything like what was done to the Africans transported over to the United States by people who's religion laid down no laws with reference to slavery. Slavery in Islam is not perpetual and doesn't transcend subsequent generation. Every slave earns a wage, the wage must be paid timely and they eventually earn their freedom. It does mean that, as a general rule, Muslims can cohabit with female slaves who are of age.

As far as Muslims following the rules associated with it in modern times, its rather difficult. You get slaves by winning wars. Islam doesn't just allow you to pick up random people and declare them your slaves. You also (generally) can not enslave other Muslims - so when a Muslim extremist group fights another Muslim extremist group, they don't get to take any slaves. In the recent past, Muslims have generally been fighting other Muslims so there hasn't been a lot of associated booty or slaves.

Slavery in Islam isn't simply about sex though. Suppose you're at war, and your army kills a child's family. The child is your slave, but the majority of the world would look at rearing the child as 'adoption' and not outright slavery. In any case, the topic is a lot more nuanced. 




 I don't know specifically about Mother's Day. I was actually talking about the logic for prohibition of *all* secular holidays, "All celebrations which differ from the Eids prescribed in Islam are innovated festivals" - which is how I understood what Sh. Salih b. Uthaymeen was saying. Other scholars don't count non-religious festivals in the same category:

[Sh. Abdullah b Bayyah](http://en.islamtoday.net/artshow-411-3472.htm)

[Sh. Salman al Ouda](http://en.islamtoday.net/node/618) 




 Sh. Salman al Ouda opined the opposite. There isn't one 'right' opinion in jurisprudence. 




  Netanyahu was born in the United States

You're right. OP is not wrong to consider Netanyahu a native speaker. He's spent a lot of time over the course of his youth and adult life in this country. 




 Yep, flash some buzzwords, exploit their sympathy *for you* as they're passing by trying to get to the next class and say stuff that people generally agree with "let's not bomb people" "give peace a chance". The whole video was bullshit. 




 For the US, "hearts and minds" was just a strategy - that's not the case here.... People don't join extremist religious groups for no reason. These people legitimately believe they're doing something good for their community, as misguided as they may be. 




 If it's one thing the various factions of Islam can agree on it's that the Koran is a perfect transmission from God and has never changed since Mohammed's revelation. 

Most sects believe that, sure. 




 They won't be welcomed. IS basically waltzed into Tikrit and Baiji. I know from anecdote and even videos of people thronging to them when they came in. Locals helped IS identify particular soldiers they despised from the army when IS executed many prisoners. Things may have changed, but Sunnis in places like Tikrit and Baiji have plenty of reasons to despise the Shi'ite army - possibly more than IS, if IS is actually not doing them too sharp. 




 No - they killed people associated with Sahwa and they killed certain tribal leaders. There are *a lot* of tribal leaders and vested parties. 




 You will quickly find religious fundamentalism after a defeat followed by years of humiliation. 




 If the city falls to a suicide bombing, it'll be called Kurt Kobane 




  IS is a fanatical upstart regime. They are recruiting thousands of disillusioned youths from Western Europe.

IS is made up almost entirely of recruits from Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Tunisia. The disillusioned youths from Western Europe form a trivial component of their standing army.
 




 Our media needs to inflate this trivial hot-spot, let's not bring facts into this one.

3--- 3--- 3--- 




 These stories are being told by rather questionable anonymous sources. At the same time, AI has a good reputation in the West for their reporting. 




  This sort of thing goes without saying yet people still act shocked. After all it's called the Islamic state, not the Buddhist state or the Episcopalian state. 

[Burma/Myanmar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Burma_anti-Muslim_riots) is considered a Buddhist state by both demographics and constitution. 




 Because things aren't as simple as our media makes it seem. 




 ["the death toll may be in the hundreds of millions."](http://i.imgur.com/mMBILmY.jpg?1) 




 When it's actually a genocide. [Proving genocide](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ksk5j/hundreds_of_iraqi_tribesmen_opposed_to_islamic/clp6hyu) isn't as easy as throwing the word around meaninglessly. 




  but i have heard some pretty nasty things of ISIS members raping small children (even babies) 

As far as propaganda goes - that's some of the nuttiest 




 Through the more reliable primary source:

http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/30/iraq-isis-executed-hundreds-prison-inmates

The article that was posted by OP is very shoddy journalism at best, complicit deceit by the journalist about a very serious international matter at worst. 




 If you're not Muslim, you'll be paying 5% jizya tax on your earnings. If you are Muslim however, you'll only pay 2.5% zakat tax - but, you run the risk of being drafted into the standing army. As a member of the fighting force, if you don't die, you'll be forced to fork over 20% of earnings as khums tax. Avoiding taxes with IS is like taking out a mortgage - you can pay a shittier fixed rate, or pay the lower rate with the possibility of being sucked into something much riskier. Going as a non-Muslim under a guarantee of safety is probably your best tax-bracket bet. 




 Why? Engineering departments are already full of virgins. Lots of them. 




 I've heard they do have black market stock options. They're performing a bit better than Hezbollah and the Iraqi army, with a strong upwards trend. I'm bullish on IS stock. 




 It's very difficult to kiss your head. Even when you're decapitated. 




 This is the same reason I became an alterboy at the church. 




 TL;DR Grassy Knolls is a phrase associated with the assassination of President Kennedy. Bibi Netanyahu is implying a presidential assassination of the president of the United States. Our media didn't care and instead focused on just the "third world" jab. Our media did the same thing when the tape leaked about the US role in government change in Ukraine. Rather than focus on the meat of the tape, we focused on the fact that a government official used the F-bomb.

I think I'm going to be sick. 




 Israel won't sink without the $3 billion in direct military aid. It makes up 1% of Israel's GDP. It was great to cement its existence while the country matured, but its not as significant as people think. 




 Bombings aren't exclusively against JN/IS. Bombings have also been directed against alleged SAA positions. During the Israel/Palestine debacle of late, Israel even attacked an SAA position on the grounds of there being a rocket mysteriously flying in from there. I wouldn't be surprised if Syrian air defense and long distance capabilities are targeted in the near future as well. 




 I really appreciate your insightful post - should've gotten more upvotes/visibility as its one of the rare handful of meaningful posts on this sub. 




 When he posted - this thread was still being bombarded. Things change once a thread makes front page... 




 You should edit your post. What you're referring to only happens to articles while they're still working their way up. By the time an article hits front page, a lot of the comments that make it up are pretty well-reasoned. 




 Well, its not like they can give the furniture to the Gazans now that their flats are completely demolished. 




 Probably a lot. The same way people dismiss good things they appear to have done as well. The story isn't black and white, but it's definitely a bit troubling that young impressionable minds are being recruited to blindly follow apparent leaders operating from hiding. 




 Fun fact, when these guys were first closing in on Baghdad (or so it seemed), the Shi'i government there ran mass executions of Sunnis accused of being "Sleeper Cells", Sunni inmates, and so on and so forth, and anti-regime Shi'ites like followers of Sarkhi. Course that wasn't covered by HP or Reuters... 




 Jews aren't allowed on the Temple Mount anyways under Rabbinic law either... 




 Nope none of that. 'Ali is a common Sunni name also btw. 




 Can one identify a Shi'te from a Sunni from appearance or accent? 

No. The issue most people, especially in the West, don't want to touch with a ten foot pole is that the only way to do this is through the collaboration of locals. It goes back to the (now ignored) suffering of Sunnis in Iraq over the past several years under the democratically elected Shi'ite government.

Some people hypothesized that they can ask questions or ask you about something Sunni-specific. Firstly, that makes sense if you have 5-6 prisoners. It's not a reasonable way to go about things to have an interview for 200 prisoners. This also discounts that mainstream Shi'ism is a reactionary religion to the Orthodoxy. Religious texts of Shi'ites actually teach Shi'ites about the majority opinions as well - their belief is that their leaders did put on a public face as Sunnis but were secretly teaching a completely different religion. It would be rather difficult to single out Shi'ites on this alone.

What would make things easy is lining up 300 men, bringing around villagers who sympathize with you and who suffered at the hands of some of the prisoners. Have them point out the guys they like to keep alive from amongst the prisoners, guys they'd particularly want dead, etc. 




 People here don't like to read - so let's be clear about one thing - they aren't mass executing civilians or committing some "genocide" per this article. They're killing, en mass, people who physically oppose them, etc.

according to witnesses who said most of the victims were members of the police or an anti-Islamic State militia called Sahwa (Awakening).

Is it a war crime? Dunno enough about international law, but seems like a mass execution of unarmed prisoners would be. Is it the carte blanche murder of an entire demographic or whole generation? No. 




 We can rest easy that they likely died swift and painless. Torture is more the forte of the Iraqi army than these guys. 




 He's probably never had someone throw a rock at his head out of desperation. I'd venture to guess it has something to do with him probably not usurping or destroying other people's homes, livlihoods and even their lives. Just a guess. 




 It was funny. There's a place for stuff like that in Middle School - College. International politics - probably not so much. 




 And most of Sweden isn't Ikea either. The point was that Israel can get away with caricatures of foreign states, while foreign statesmen would have to deal with the Anti-Semite card had they done the same. 




 For not being cunty enough. 




 We should force Israeli politicians to team up with a Palestinian politician and together assemble some ikea furniture. This would promote cooperation and teamwork like never before.

But the Israeli will get to keep the furniture. The Palestinian who's home was just demolished doesn't have a place to put it - I don't think he needs it. 














































































































































































 Hypothesis: There is a pattern indicative of bias in moderation by certain moderators at r/worldnews.

Test: Do you have examples of this bias? Please post your analysis - or cases you notice (especially if you have information about the mods involved) at http://np.reddit.com/r/isrworldnewsbiased/

In the past two days, I've seen three articles, several with karma in the 3 digit range, get removed. The recurring theme in each of those articles? They all brought up Israel - and they all did so in a not-so-positive light. I've never seen the moderation team act so swiftly and I must commend them for staying ever-vigilant. At the same time, it's a bit troubling that articles critical of Russia, China and ISIS keep seeming to get accidentally missed by their moderation team even when the articles are from (a) baseless sources or (b) opinion pieces. It's also troubling that in spite of the vigilance of the moderation team with respect to articles that point out terrorism practiced by Israelis, that they seem to keep missing other articles that their logic for removal would apply to. I've set out to help our friends at r/worldnews. They're probably just dropping the ball because they're super-duper busy.

I've started the above sub to keep track of cases like this. Here are the benefits to having a sub for this purpose:

- When somebody asks you why you referred them to /r/worldpolitics when there's a default sub with over a million subscribers that even Google picks up, you can link them to /r/isrworldnewsbiased. Rather than break it down explicitly for them, you can tell them why alt subs are healthy for the ecosystem.

- When somebody asks you why you're being a such a crazy tin-foil hat wacko and criticizing the immaculate moderation team at r/worldnews that has never done anything but uphold the principles Reddit was founded on - you can again direct them to the above sub which ought to be completely empty as a demonstration of how fair the moderation team at r/worldnews is.

- When you (falsely) criticize r/worldnews and somebody accuses you of using an isolated example to cast doubt on the credibility of the mods at r/worldnews and their commitment to the free flow of information - you can also link them to the above sub rather than digging for other (false) pieces of evidence.

http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2jezyd/a_lowcaste_teenage_boy_in_india_has_been_burnt_to/

Notice the difference. It took them almost a full day to act on this clearly local crime story that built its way to the front page. Meanwhile, they deleted stories of open terrorism (in 2 of the cases near the top of this post) under the pretense of 'local crime' in less than 3 hrs. The story regarding Shlomo Sand was actually removed **while they left this particular story about an Indian crime up** - only to take it down much later.
