 Can someone explain why The Simpsons isn't on any on demand service like Netflix? 




 I don't think so, at uni a lot of american exchange students seem to take a lot back home so i'm guessing they can't buy them there.  




 To be fair though Tim Tams are totally worth checking out. 




 Personally I really loved it because it was a more personal tale for Bond as it explored his history and childhood. A sentiment that is echoed in how M says "orphans make the best agents", which kind of makes you feel for Bond since he is a fairly cold and ruthless character.  




 The theatrical cut glosses over or completely cuts out many key characters that are integral to the actual story. The directors cut re-inserts this aspect into the film and adds layers to the developing world around the characters as well as political story threads which establish conflicts during the film. The directors cut is a 3 hour long film while the theatrical is around 2hrs 20 minutes, which gives you an idea of just how much was cut out.  




 Agree completely, the theatrical release of the film is completely different to the directors cut. 




 Was that scene even filmed? If it wasn't, would it even count as a deleted scene since it never existed to begin with? 




 Damn haha I had no idea! 




 Umm wouldn't a bike use less energy than walking or running, especially since you can just coast on a bike.  




 Hey bud try and list your other computer specs if you can!

Current CPU, GPU, Power Supply, RAM, Motherboard and of course what's your budget? 




 So is this one of the few big next gen games that actually hit its date without being delayed?  




 Looks like a set from Alien on board the ship Nostromo.  




 This one's easy!

[Moby-God Moving Over The Face of Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3IXg8t8Ybs)

Used in the ending scene for Heat (1995). 




 You have been living a lie mate, 4th of Goblet of Fire directed by Mike Newell and the 5th is Order of the Phoenix, directed by David Yates.  




 So how's that RPG coming along?? 




 Well the game is pretty much dead here in Australia. You can only really get a game of attrition and that's in the evenings on weekdays and weekends. Any other mode you are SOL since the population is dead. Playing on the US and EU servers isn't an option since the pings are too high.  




 I imagine we won't hear a single thing about it once Witcher 3 is released. 




 It sucks for me, I live in Australia and the game is basically dead! You can most likely find a game of attrition in the evening on weekdays and weekends but want to play a different game mode? Tough luck and playing on different servers is not really a viable option due to the ping affecting gameplay :/ 




 Oddly enough I live in Australia and Avengers and Amazing Spiderman 2 both came out at least 2-3 weeks earlier than the US. 




 Have you actually seen any of the films? 









 These cars looked so cool that year, everything looked very experimental.  




 The assembly cut in my opinion actually makes it a much better film, while it still isn't as great as Alien or Aliens it is still a fascinating film since it continues the trend of each subsequent film having a drastically different tone. I think it's worth checking out especially for the cinematography which is truly amazing.  




 I always thought that the man on the balcony was hinted at being Ziegler. However there are many theories, even a theory that he may have been the main leader, the man in red.  




 Haha ah right, yeah VB may be iconic but it is not iconic for its taste, that's for sure! 




 Haha yep! 




 Why can't EA just put the DLC on Origin instead of running it through Bioware's website :/ 




 My favourite use of that smile is when he burnt Piers Morgan in the studio.  




 Really *VB?*.... 




 The Day The World Went Away by NIN - Terminator Salvation Trailer 




 Definitely Contagion. It seemed to handle the outbreak in a rather realistic manner especially when you compare it to a film like Outbreak where they end up chasing after a monkey in the forest for the cure.  




 This was actually pointed out to me by James Cameron in the directors commentary on the blu ray.   




 These pics should be cross posted to /r/WTF and copy and paste your text into the first post. You may get a lot more responses.  




 It actually reminded me of those weird fake adverts at the start of Metal Gear Solid 4.  




 Could be Australian like me where the average adult price for a movie is $17+ 




 I'm pretty sure he is the Santa Clause that stabs Simon Pegg's hand at the start of the film.  




 I feel that all the Euro cars get it as they have intuitive knobs for controlling all your music/nav while being able to keep focused on the road.  




 Anyone here think Hugh Jackman could play a great Joel? [Here](http://images.askmen.com/1200x600/video/entertainment-and-celebrities/hugh-jackman-prisoners-interview-1085204-TwoByOne.jpg) he is in Prisoners, which is what made me think he would make a great Joel. 




 I agree I enjoyed the film. To be fair though, Need for Speed is probably one of the easiest games to adapt into a film since none of the games really feature an in depth narrative with fleshed out characters that are remotely memorable. So in that regard NFS was extremely easy to pull off since you only need to feature fast cars and cops.  




 Fillion would have been great maybe 5 or 7 years ago but he looks a bit too old now for Drake.  




 Yeah he was a miscast for Prince of Persia  but I don't think he was the main problem with the film. 




 So that means it will probably be like $1000 dollars in Australia. 




 I was a boom operator for two short films during uni, nothing serious mind you but man my arms and back were wrecked by the end. It didn't help that the old guy we had as an actor kept forgetting his lines.  




 So in the aftermath of both MH370 and now MH17 will Malaysia Airlines be able to sustain these tragedies and keep moving forward or are they already on their way out and expected to go under soon? Just curious to hear your guys opinions.  




 Cautiously optimistic, Uncharted on paper seems like a very easy game to make into a film but a lot of these easy on paper ideas have fucked up so monumentally in the past. It will be interesting to see how the Warcraft film turns out in 2016 as that is also a big budget video game adaptation.  




 What's the song you used in this vid? 




 While it's not a video, I have to say the [Jonestown death tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkookcrAnSE) is some creepy shit. Just knowing what was actively going down in that recording is way too fucked up.   




 The performance of a youngling.  














 As much as I disliked Age of Extinction (4th Transformers film) it is a lot easier to now tell who is fighting who when it comes to the transformers.  




 Cheers thanks mate
 




 Hey what is the wallpaper on your laptop? Is there a 1920x1080 version of it? 




 Yeah I'm in the same boat man, the game was obviously quite populated at launch and a month or 2 after then I stopped playing it for a few months and now when I wanted to get back into it I can't :(  









 Man I love the look and feel of all of Michael Mann's films. Especially Miami Vice, Collateral and Public Enemies. I felt it gives it a much more intimate feel with the viewer.  




 I always thought banks were pretty strict on copyrighted images etc being used on cards. Do they just not check I guess? 




 Hey guys so I came across these short films that bridge the 10 year gap between the Dawn of the Apes and Rise of the Apes film. They are actually very reminiscent of The Last of Us from the setting to the way they are shot. I feel you guys would really like them, they are also very well acted! 









 Yeah but the question is if it's actually interesting enough to be made into a film.  




 Hey OP what's the setup for that racing wheel? It looks quite nifty! 




 Australia, ping is usually 17ms 




 From what I understand, they were reviewing the bike and the journo just fucked up.  




 Does the game scale difficulty according to the amount of players? I haven't quite figured that out yet.  




 I did Day 3 of the Framing Frame for the first time with 3 buddies on very hard difficulty (stealth) and it took so many fucking tries to get it right. That stage I feel really depends on the placement of the items and layout of cameras. Although doing it stealth and getting all the gold is worth the effort as it nets a nice $590k. It can mentally break you though.  




 The upcoming film [Fury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q94n3eWOWXM list=PLYeOyMz9C9kYmnPHfw5-ItOxYBiMG4amq) starring Brad Pitt looks like it has some very good looking props and sets. 









 I hope so. I feel that Kojima would probably want to try something new as well but he is in the unfortunate position of Konami owning the IP and he is afraid they'll run it into the ground. I would love to see Kojima remake/re-adapt Snatcher for the modern era.  




 Man I would recognise that TV anywhere. Pioneer Kuro Plasma, one of the best! 




 My face is my warrant.  




 This trailer reminded me of the [Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk0PZMsk9ps) trailer. They have very similar looking aesthetics.  




 I have a strong feeling that it was a much cheaper effect to do the floating cubes than to have them actually transform.  




 Holy shit so this is my first time commenting on this sub and I think you perfectly described how I feel! I couldn't really put it into words until I read this, thank you. 




 I feel that makes owning a beamer even better if it's your weekend car, that way it feels extra special when you get to drive it! 




 I would recommend it as the driving in this game is pretty abysmal, I can't imagine what it would be like with a keyboard. Also combat is better suited to a controller imo. 




 Me too, I was more of a Sack Lunch kinda guy. 




 Shawshank Redemption for me.  




 For all the hate this car got it sure looks incredibly comfortable. How's the maintenance on this car OP? 




 It's on the *right* side. 




 As someone who has very hairy legs, is it worth it? 




 Any news on whether the UK/AUS release will be censored? 




 I think Media Hint isn't free anymore. Try using Hola Unblocker.  




 Hah I was wondering if this was Sydney, I felt the bus kind of gave it away even though it's blurry as hell. 




 Hahah yeah it does look like a ghetto interface, is it accurate?  




 OP what is home schooling like? How long do you get taught for per day? 




 She's actually smiling in this one! 




 Yeah almost all negative press about the film has been in regards to it's box office performance which is a shame because it's such a fantastic film.  




 Can that screen still display navigation? If so can it even be updated? 




 Does Sidwell still work for Tony? I thought he left to start up his own hedgefund. 




 Can we just talk about how unrealistic it is that Daft Punk would be having a concert.  




 Fuck me, if this is true that they are planning a trilogy in with Mass Effect style decision based choices then I am beyond stoked for this. DE:HR was one of my favourite games last gen and to see it return like this will blow my mind.  




 Hahah this where I first heard that scream! 




 From what I remember he was about to but they crashed and he was knocked out by the airbag, then waking up in the infirmary with another persons blood.  




 She said she could feel it, she felt that she had lost the power much like Cage said he had felt he lost it as well after the car crash.  




 I just checked the Ford AU site and it has this quote:

"There's a thrilling 5.0-litre V8 engine option available, but the real news is how we've unleashed Mustang-level performance from Ford's highly efficient 2.3L EcoBoost engine." 

Then it again it does say specifications will change closer to date.  




 So nothing like Batman then.  




 What kind of material are these made of? They look so weak but seem to do quite a bit of damage to someone. 




 We won't get the Mustang here in Aus though :( 




 She explains in the film that she bled out exactly like Cage did and when she woke up she had lost the power. She never said she died and lost it but that she bled out and had her blood replaced.  




 I think pretty much all these changes are for the best. The film ending can also be up for interpretation, while it isn't as directly sad as the book ending, it can still be sad in it's on way since film Cage may have almost fallen for Rita but due to the reset he realises that she wouldn't remember him nor fall for him.  




 When they tease the other 2 films at the end it really reminded me of the [teaser for The Matrix Reloaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-URQ4sMzBvA).  




 Splitscreen is very hard to develop into a game. It requires extensive coding and testing plus it would probably add a delay to a game. Personally the amount of people who would be using split screen would be minimal and thus the effort required for the amount of people that would use it is not worth it.  




 Hahah this is actually hilarious 




 Fuck I love elephants.  




 I wonder if the film would have done better in the US if they kept that title. While it may sound like a silly title it is catchy and doesn't sound as generic as edge of tomorrow.  




 Do you guys think Mel Gibson could make a career comeback? The last film I saw him in was Get The Gringo which, personally I loved. It seems that he really isn't getting any recognition because of some off screen incidents. Personally I would like to see him direct again.  




 Are you sure you don't mean A.I? 




 So I saw this for the first time a few weeks ago and I don't really know how to feel about this one. It seems like a fairly dry film but with some seemingly cool ideas and themes. The masked party in particular was very interesting and has that perfect mysterious air about the whole situation, however I just don't know how to feel about the film overall I felt kind of empty after watching it haha. What was the general consensus for this film, it being Stanley Kubricks last film as well.  




 Yeah I generally do shoot on manual mode and got some decent snaps I just didn't know you used the stock lens to get these shots! 




 I know that a lot of people didn't like the film but I have a feeling that The Counselor may get a cult following.  




 Why exactly do they owe Sony an exclusive game? 




 Well shit I have the exact same camera and lens haha it seems now I know what is capable of my camera.
