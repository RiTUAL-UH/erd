 Despite the conflicting nature of these left and right analyses, there is a strong case to be made that they are, in fact, complementary and that they reinforce each other. What if we put it together this way? Automation, foreign competition and outsourcing lead to a decline in well-paying manufacturing jobs, which, in turn, leads to higher levels of unemployment and diminished upward mobility, which then leads to fewer marriages, a rise in the proportion of nonmarital births, increased withdrawal from the labor force, impermanent cohabitation and a consequent increase in dependence on government support. The major roadblock to synthesizing competing explanations has been  and continues to be  political polarization. Vested interests on the left and right have delayed, and in some cases prevented, recognition of the overlap between liberal and conservative hypotheses, and have pointedly ignored evidence that contradicts their preconceived partisan positions.

Most of what you need to know about the causes poverty in America and our inability to reduce it in a few sentences. 
 









 True, but's it's so amusing. I particularly enjoy this part. 

Ryan professed not to know the price of the wine, and one of his buddies responded to Feinberg's chastisement by loudly saying, "Fuck her," Feinberg told TPM.

Ryan is a guy who complains about the lack of civility in politics and public life.  But when he had an opportunity to correct one of his buddies, appears he didn't step up. 




 Somehow [Paul Ryan's report on poverty](http://budget.house.gov/waronpoverty/)  never mentions this issue. Now why would that be?   




 May be?  Is. FTFW 




 If you want to extend the alliteration, you could add bankers and bumblers. 




 I see Texas has moved up to [30th](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_income#cite_note-1) among the states in per capita income while managing to maintain [46th place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_income#cite_note-1) for it's poverty rate.  Maybe one day Texas will catch up with New Jersey.  which has somehow, with high taxes and without the enormous natural resources Texas has,  managed to have a higher income and a lower poverty rate. Oh  and why have property values held steady in Texas?  Funny thing, a [legal restriction](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/03/AR2010040304983.html), played a big role in that.  




 That's why, no matter what the problem, Republicans insist that government is not the solution; tax cuts for the wealthy are. There's only one hitch: none of this is really true.

But that's no reason not to believe it. 









 That's a pretty funny simile. I'm gonna steal it and claim it as my own, just like a banker. 




 What's even more amazing is that we're supposed to take him seriously.   




 Should we keep bailing out the bankers when [they fail](http://dailybail.com/home/busted-watch-tarp-republican-paul-ryan-begging-congress-to-v.html)? They should keep all their profits when they succeed and be rescued when they fail?  Paul Ryan seems to think so. 




 Paul Ryan - Putting America's bankers and billionaires first! 









 Alternately, the GOP could stop talking nonsense. 




 There might be some other writers at the National Review who are thoughtful on race relations, but I doubt these ideas are widely held among conservatives.  If you put the above quote in front of the voters who selected Mitt Romney, what percentage do you think would agree with it? 




 The fourth view, closest to my own, is that the problem is fundamentally one of economics and economic history: Having been formally shut out of much of the economy until within recent memory, African Americans simply lag behind the average. The relatively fast economic advancement of other minority groups, such as Vietnamese immigrants, does not negate that premise: The history and position of black Americans is fundamentally different from that of immigrant groups. American institutions expended a great deal of effort to help assimilate and advance Vietnamese refugees, while many of those institutions had spent a solid century after the Civil War working to prevent the assimilation and advancement of African Americans.

I'm rather surprised to see a paragraph like this in the National Review.  I wonder how many of Williamson's fellow conservatives agree with it. Not many, I'd think. 




 Not to mention the economic system. 




 Thanks. The best insults are the ones you can back up. 




 GOP congressional candidate Torrey Westrom is an obvious [moron. ]  (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/09/19/heres-why-the-47-percent-argument-is-an-abuse-of-tax-data/)  Next topic please 




 I would imagine the conservative country would become a low tax, low public service and low wage economy.  A large percentage of the population would  have few opportunities and no meaningful civil rights, there would be  a relatively small middle class, and with most of the wealth concentrated in a few hands. Sort of like the South until the 1970's.  The liberal side likely evolve into a society more like Canada or Northern European states.   In international affairs, I would expect the conservative nation to be isolationist or belligerent and xenophobic, or more likely alternate between the two.

 I wouldn't want to give up my car, but I'd gladly give up my daily commute if their were a reliable and reasonably quick public transportation alternative. I would cut my driving by more than half. 




 I had a friend whose mother-in-law was in an assisted living facility with dementia. My friend told me 'One day when I was visiting I looked around and noticed that almost everybody who works there smoked, the nurses, even some of the doctors who came in.  I think they saw the end game and decided they aren't staying around for it.' 




 Once I was driving and heard Ole '55 on the radio and thought to myself, 'Maybe I've misjudged the Eagles all these years. I never knew they could write a song like this.'   Turns out they can't.  




 I'm not impressed. I inherited nothing, so if you consider the ratio of wealth created to inheritance received, I've done much better than the Koch's. 




 Deut. 15:7. If there is a poor man among you, one of your brothers, in any of the towns of the land which the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart, nor close your hand to your poor brother; but you shall freely open your hand to him, and generously lend him sufficient for his need in whatever he lacks.

Good idea, and I hope all his Republican colleagues read this verse.

 




 Best comment in the thread.  I'd rather buy from a local 'natural' or 'no spray ' farmer than industrial organic everytime.  Local produce also tastes better because the farm to table time is much shorter than organic food from Chile or Mexico 




 Unless we have a collapse in the financial  industries similar to the auto industry, no. Though New York does have one hell of underfunded pension problem. 




 AND plutocracy, let's not forget plutocracy. 




 As John Stuart Mill, the British political economist, argued, people should be free to do as they please, provided they dont cause undue harm to others. But greenhouse gases have already caused great harm and threaten much worse. Mills cost-benefit framework provides no reason for thinking that someones freedom to escape the small burden of CO2 taxation should trump other, vastly more important freedoms. To the contrary, he said, restrictions on individual liberty are needed when the health and safety of the great mass of people and the purity of the natural environment are at stake.

It makes good economic sense to be a climate change denier if you're a heavy CO2 user or producer. If you argue that the problem doesn't exist, you can't be harming anyone else, and you don't need to pay to clean up your messes. 




 Correct.  Our Northern European pale skins are going to be a maladaptive characteristic soon.  




 What books are impossible to keep in stock?  I knew a used bookstore owner  who told me he was tempted to put up a sign that read. 'No, we don't have any Bukowski or Henry Miller.'. 




 Walker wants Wisconsin to become a low tax, low wage, high profit state.  Sort of like a North South Carolina. 




 Unfortunately, the availability of guns is used by the police as an [excuse for further militarization] (http://rt.com/usa/164816-american-police-militarization-war/).  I doubt that Franklin, Indiana is actually a war zone that requires armored vehicles.

 I'm with you.  I see EBT cards used to buy crap junk food much more often than I see them used for luxury foodstuffs.  




 I think the consensus opinion on the stimulus and jobs is more like [this](http://money.cnn.com/2011/09/08/news/economy/stimulus_jobs_record/). 




 Did anyone else notice that Ryan's report on poverty fails to mention that wages for low income American's have fallen dramatically over the last few decades?  The single biggest cause of poverty is essentially ignored. Honestly, you'd need an entire team of Clydesdales to come up with this much horseshit. 




 1) Renewables are more expensive now, but we've really only started to put research and money into them.  I remember a time when cell phones were much more expensive than land lines and had very limited coverage.  The relative cost of technologies can change rapidly.
2) Natural gas would be a good bridge if we're serious about reducing the methane leaks when extracting it.  Otherwise methane is serious contributor to warming as well.  




 It's not just Republican governors who you should be worried about.  There's plenty of manipulating government grants for political purposes at the local level. Do you think the Chicago Democrats would keep their hands clean when there's a big pile of block grant money in front of them? Corruption doesn't really track party lines. 




 Take a look at the [proposal](http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/expanding_opportunity_in_america.pdf).  .  Do you see any discussion about the change in [ income distribution] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States )   in the United States over the last 50 years? I can't. The biggest driver of poverty in the United States is an economic system that is concentrating wealth at the top.  Anyone who discusses poverty in the US and leaves this out is not interested in having an honest discussion. 




 Fair enough, but then the utilities need say that.  Structure a base rate with a minimum number of kilowatt hours included, and charge that amount for the monthly connection.  They could then structure rebates and further charges against that amount. 




 A homeless guy once asked me for a dollar to help make his BMW payment. I gave it to him. 




 We all want to look older than we are until we want to look younger.  There's about 5 minutes in between when age and appearance are in the right balance. 




 Atlantis.  




 I wasn't commenting on the on the proposal, but on Ryan's veracity. It seems to me that people who I've found to be dishonest tend to stay dishonest (and I don't care if you're talking about finance , romance or politics), and you should look at any proposal from such people skeptically. Perhaps you've had better experiences with reformed prevaricators than I have.    But turning to the proposal itself, I'm surprised by how much there is to like in it. Lower incarceration rates and increasing the EIC for childless adults, if it were any Republican but Paul Ryan suggesting this, he'd be getting jumped on for having become a squishy moderate.  There are also a number of dubious ideas, such as replacing programs with block grants to local governments.  I would imagine that places like Minnesota and Nebraska we'd see well run programs with impartial administrators, and in places like Chicago and Louisiana you'll see the grants abused for political favoritism, if not actually stolen.  There's also one genuinely laughable idea, life coaches.  We've had 'life coaches' for the poor since Jane Adams' Hull House, except for they're called social workers.  Relabeling them life coaches isn't going to make it any easier to transform people's lives. But here's the real problem with Ryan's plan.  Do you see any discussion about the change in [ income distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States )   in the United States over the last 50 years?  In fact, hit crtl-F, type in distribution and see how many times and where the word turns up.    How can you claim to be discussing 'Opportunity in America' and how government programs have failed  to end poverty and ignore the fact that the income of the lowest quintile has fallen so greatly compared to everyone else?  Perhaps the problem isn't really the personal pathologies among the poor, or the ineffectiveness of government programs, but a increasingly unfair economic system.  I suspect that Ryan doesn't want that discussion started, so he's hiding the ball here. Its just his latest in his long line of distortions ,dissemblings and dishonesties.  




 Ryan does have a habit of telling ["stretchers"](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fact-checking-6-claims-in-paul-ryans-convention-speech/6/).  




 I think that's a good move. US has been giving away its resources as ludicrously low prices for centuries.  If we're having an oil and gas boom without selling government resources, why put them on the market now?  And I would think our free market friends don't want the government competing with private industry to sell mineral rights. 




 Oil companies are upset that Obama isn't leasing Federal Lands at give away rates. 




 Another successful minority outreach by your Republican Party! 




 Well. since they're far from the coast, I guess they think the sea level rise and flooding won't reach them ,,, Although if I were in the coal industry, I think I'd want to support politicians who were working on new cleaner technologies.  Carbon capture would be the best chance for the coal industry to stay viable. 




 Great idea.  Also any business receiving a government subsidy or tax break  should receive a 'profit coach' and present a plan for getting of the government teat. 




 I always like to ask conservatives if they can tell me of some more contemporary examples of Republican politicians doing something for blacks.  The smart ones know about Eisenhower and civil rights, and then they kind of run out of material ....  




 House Budget Chair Paul Ryans "new" plan picks on poor children and families while not asking for one cent of sacrifice from rich corporations and rich individuals

If Paul Ryan was running an honest campaign, his slogan would be "He'll never ask the billionaires or bankers to sacrifice."  

Excellent comment.  You should send it to [Amar Kaleka](http://www.votekaleka.org/).  




 But where Ryan and others get it wrong is in their pervasive assumption that all you have to do to get a job is want a job. In this regard, here is what you need to know about work requirements: in the absence of strong labor demand, such requirements are a recipe for more, not less, poverty.

Why is it so hard to understand?  Do conservatives think the unemployment rate went from 4.7% in January 2006 to 9.7% in January 2011 because Americans became lazier and less willing to work over those 5 years? 









 Maybe it's my ethnic pride, but I think Irish Catholics are the true masters of internalized guilt. Jews talk a good game, and don't overlook the Lutherans, but for that soul-crushing, immobilizing guilt, nothing beat being Irish Catholic.

 Americans hate it when they think someone is getting a free ride, which is why attacks on welfare recipients are so effective.  If the Democrats would show that the 1% are not earning what they're getting, they'd put the Republicans on the defensive.  But only Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders seem to have the cojones for the fight.  




 The best predictions for the 2012 election were not done by Nate Silver, but from Sam Wang at [Princeton Election Consortium](http://election.princeton.edu/ ). He predicted Obama's win earlier that just about anyone else, missed only Florida in the electoral college, and called all the Senate seats correctly.  At the moment, his prediction on the Senate is "Bottom line, Democrats have a 55% chance of control in an election held today. That is as close to a toss-up as it gets. " 




 So were these increases in homicides made up entirely of justified homicides allowed under the new laws? Both studies were inconclusive, but the authors seemed doubtful. The Georgia State study noted that substituting assailants for innocents didn't account for the increase. The Texas A M analysis concluded it was "unlikely, albeit not impossible."
 









 Its puerilty has finally crossed over into indecency. Its triviality has finally crossed over into obscenity.

 I read Vonnegut as a teenager and young adult, and then ignored him for years afterward, thinking he was an entertaining writer, but kind of an intellectual lightweight.  But as I've gotten older , I've come to the opinion he may not have been the most subtle or original thinker America produced, but damn, he was often right on the money.  You needn't be a complex writer and thinker to be a good one. 




 While there are some well written and reasoned counterarguments to Krugman, but articles with titles like [Paul Krugman Is Dumber Than We Thought](http://www.forbes.com/sites/richkarlgaard/2014/07/11/paul-krugmans-is-dumber-than-we-thought/) are far more common. 









 Krugman is being demonized by the right wing press because they don't have answers for his arguments. And if you can't win the argument, you attack the person making it.  




 And Ryan's a smarmy liar too!  They should really be better friends. 




 I'm always amused that these clowns need to go back 50+ years to find examples of Republicans fighting racism.  Why they don't cite so more contemporary civil rights advocates, like say Jesse Helms?

 No matter how tight Wisconsin's budgets are, Walker can always find money to reward his cronies and toadies.   




 Excellent point. What the economy needs now is consumers with money in their pockets, not more capital.  But since it doesn't fit the conservative dogma, ain't gonna happen.

 Perhaps, but I think the tag of 'Red State Socialist' might make it harder for southern and Western conservatives to pretend their states aren't dependent on government spending, and make it more difficult for them toss off the word 'socialist' every time someone suggests an improvement to social welfare programs or reasonable regulation.
