 When I was on deployment to the Persian Gulf on a minesweeper, we were doing a large multi-national operation to clear the historically mined areas near the large oil platforms that were mined during the first Gulf War. We had a media day where all of the ships got in a large circle, all facing inwards. The goal was to take a picture of all the ships together, and right in the middle of everything they were going to blow up a mine. As all of the ships had just finished getting into position, a sandstorm came out of nowhere and just swallowed up everything around us. We couldn't see the ship next to us, which was only a few hundred yards away. I thought that there was no way they would blow up the mine without being able to see, but then I heard the countdown come over the radio. Ten, nine, eight...  




 I learned that you can side-chain instrument track using the multipressor plugin in Logic to open up room for vocals, and set it so that it cuts the frequencies when the vocals kick in and then immediately returns them after the vocals cut out.
