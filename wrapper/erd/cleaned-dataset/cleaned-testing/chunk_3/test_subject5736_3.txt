 Can you build up muscle and lose weight at the same? Everywhere I see people say you have to have a surplus of calories to get significant muscle growth, but that would also make you gain weight, right?  Im trying to get rid of my gut and build up some muscle before summer, 5'10" 190. Been really confused with nutrition recently and looking for some guidance.  




 Here are some of my favourites http://imgur.com/a/gOmaM 




 I'm going to be playing pretty much all day, and I seriously want to improve my gear before the season ends so I can have a serious condemn build. I've yet to find a Blade of Prophecy, and I need a few other gear improvements. I'm looking for T6 crusaders to farm with today. My battle tag is test_subject5736#1644 




 So i went to run Dragon Age, and it acted as if it was the first time it had run, and i lost my save data and settings. I have the files in the bioware folder but i don't know how to get them to be used in the game?

Basically since i'm in Canada my options are limited so I've narrowed it down to the Canadian N550JK version (https://www.cdw.ca/shop/products/ASUS-N550JK-DB71-15.6in-Core-i7-4700HQ-Windows-8.1-64-bit-12-GB-RAM/3338923.aspx?enkwrd=asus%20n550jk-db71#TS) and the Canadian Y50 (http://shop.lenovo.com/ca/en/laptops/lenovo/y-series/y50/#customize)

If i got the ASUS id replace the HDD with a 250GB SSD and move the HDD to the optical drive. If i get the Y50, the upper model already has an SSD (only 512GB but should be enough storage). The GTX860M is about 30% better on average framerate than the GTX850M. So basically, which would you go for? i love the red look of the Y50, but it is more pricey (i would get a discount of prolly a few hundred of the ASUS). Is it worth the extra?
