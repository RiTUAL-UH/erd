 When discussing his favorite films since he started directing, he said The Matrix was his favorite before he saw the sequels which 'ruined the mythology' for him.  I consider the sequels strangely sub-par films compared to the original but am curious what specifically do you think he meant by them ruining the mythology.


I'm looking for specific examples/themes/etc pertaining to the mythology set up by the first film.  Thanks!


Edit: Grammar/clarification.


Bonus Edit:  Here's the [video of Tarantino talking about his favorite films since he started directed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv0WlHbBhdc).  He talks about the Matrix around 3:00.

 Something you did by accident, did on purpose, were told to do by a faculty member, had to do daily, etc. Just the worst thing you've done while at any school (preschool, elementary, middle/junior high, high school, college, professional school, apprenticeship, field trip, study abroad, etc, etc).

Doesn't have to be school-related. Just something you did 'at school'. 




 Something you did by accident, did on purpose, were told to do by your superior, have to do daily, etc.  Just the worst thing you've done at any job you've ever had.  Doesn't have to be work-related.  Just something you did 'at work'.

Edit:  Quite the overwhelming response!  Made me realize what a model employee I am, though still searching for a full-time writing position.  Maybe I don't have a scandalous enough work history to be hired yet.  Back to applications.  Thanks for the thousands of laughs, gasps, and cringes. 




 Could be something from when you were chatting, emailing, gaming, shopping, downloading, browsing sites, applying for jobs, creating sites, video chatting, etc, etc, etc.  Anything online. 




 For kicks, here are the single frames between the cut..

And here is a better angle of the bone a spin or so before the cut.. [Better angle](http://i.imgur.com/LfWFuRt.jpg)  ..Though obviously, the bone in this frame doesn't 'touch' the device.  The misaligned angle bone, so to speak, DOES 'touch' the device in the frame.  Perhaps this is one of the reasons it is used.


Also, notice the vertical antenna (or whatever it is) on the device just after the cut.  Curiously, it's slightly misaligned with its base.  In the next frame (and beyond), it's attached.  Here is the second frame after the cut..  [Second frame after cut](http://i.imgur.com/6iFjGxd.jpg)  ..Maybe a transfer issue with the DVD?  Unnoticed special effects flaw sort of like the helicopter blade shadows in The Shining? 




 As you can see, when you slow down the scene and/or watch it frame-by-frame, you can see the angles do not line up, which could have easily been done with a few less frames.  Since Kubrick was a known perfectionist and quite in control of every aspect of his films, it would seem he purposely ensured they were not lined up. (Perhaps to symbolize the road of technology was imperfect?)  What are your thoughts?

(And yes, supposedly that's a nuclear device and not a communications satellite.)

 




 I think it's one of the more beautiful/playful/romantic shots.  Just her smiling and laughing going back and forth.  Here's a clip I found on youtube, though there may be better clips online or perhaps you have the DVD.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74M0hPAeFHs  Grazie!!!

 No worries.  You're welcome. 




 Yup, I'm great.

Since there were so many questions and comments before, I thought I'd let you all know that we ended our relationship.  She's continuing with therapy.  After talking with me over several weeks, we've concluded that it's best if she is not intimate with men (for the foreseeable future).  She's always been bisexual, but becomes very anxious when thinking about intercourse with a man now, but says she still wants to be with me.  She thinks she can overcome the feelings she has when she's intimate with me, since she loves me.  Over time, I was able to convince her to move on.  She's been with women before, but hadn't really been consensually intimate with a man besides myself.  Her studies are improving now, and she's getting healthier.  We'll be fine.
