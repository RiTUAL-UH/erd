 Thank you! I honestly never done any other shows, but I certainly can! I was really inspired to paint something from this show because I absolutely love the style of the show; the colors and cinematography! It' a really gorgeous show!  




 From looking at pictures of Robin for reference, I guess I just sorta picked up that little attribute!  




 That wasn't my intention, but I guess it is interesting how that played out, haha!  




 Oh... thanks, I guess.  




 Thank you, so much!  




 I don't plan on selling this particular piece, only because I want to avoid legal trouble, but I do have other pieces of art for sale here:http://society6.com/cassy_dale

Thank you so much for your interest!
