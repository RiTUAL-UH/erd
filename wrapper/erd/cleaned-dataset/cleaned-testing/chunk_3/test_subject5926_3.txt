 Try Soul Eater 




 Hell yeah ! :D nice to see someone with same hobbyies.  
My steamid : test_subject5926 // feel free to add me :) 




 Akame ga kills "Kill the newcomers" after the new guys came really caught my attention 




 man those fma ones, dem feels
 




 * How the fuck do i get rid of that emptiness inside when i finish a new anime?  
  
Thats the hardest part, best way is probably filling hole with another series   
also: My first anime was Soul Eater, after i finished it i felt big hole, but then i got the manga and read it and i felt way better, yeah and watching AMV of series you just finished will also help (at least for me it does)  
  
* Is there a way to control the "just one more episode and i'll go to bed"?  
  
Cant answer you on that one, its 5am here and Im sitting here watching anime.  
  
* I've spent way to much time on anime lately, so now that i'm into anime, is there a way out?  
  
Why would you want to get out ? Its like trying to jump out of luxury train, why would you do it ?
 




 yeah soul eater needs one hard and akame ga kill would also be nice,  
it got so annoying at the end i wasnt able to finish the last episode to this day 




 Code Geass R2 was pretty amazing 




 I wouldnt risk hugging him  




 Invoker, Shadow fiend, Meepo 




 Damn i really wanted that number...
