 Well, I'm not bald, but my husband is.  

When I was 20 weeks pregnant, we got one of those 3-D ultrasound photos of our unborn daughter.  She already very clearly had my husband's nose.  When I would show it to people, I would say proudly "She already looks just like her daddy," and more than one person, totally serious mind you, would say "Oh, because she's bald?"

Guys.  Come on.  He shaves his head.  It's not a genetic trait.  She came out with a Mohawk, incase you were curious.  




 I collect a certain set of Christmas tree ornaments.  I also keep track of a bunch of silly little details on them (release year, amount paid, place procured, release number, etc) in an Excel spreadsheet.  I mentioned this spreadsheet in a job interview.  Obviously I was just about laughed out of the room, but they still offered me the job.  Even at six months pregnant. 




 That Tiefling they make you party with in Neverwinter Nights 2.  I can't remember her stupid name.   




 A lot of court issued documents are public property and some states have begun putting them on the internet.  If you know someone's name and date of birth, you can find things that can potentially lead you to other things.  I had the most luck with tracking down things like divorce papers and death certificates to give me locations that I then used to check archived obituaries for.  Obits list survivors.  You can look up these survivors' phone number and get leads.  




 Aww, thank you Sunshiny Cloud!  I'm glad things got better for you!  You're a very kind person, your kids are lucky to have you. :)   




 "it will take about two years to get back on track"

I'm so grateful to you I have tears in my eyes.  Thank you so much.  Really.  Thank you.  




 No, not yet.  My OB decided to do a pap at my two month post-natal appointment, so my insurance doesn't cover another well-woman until 2016.  I didn't even think about it at the time!  Do you think it's serious enough that I should just pony up out of pocket?  (I've got high deductible insurance.) Thank you for the response. :) 




 Hello,

My daughter is now seven months old, but I'm still dealing with a lot of the physical symptoms from my pregnancy. The most annoying one is the carpal tunnel. I've lost all my baby weight, why are my arms and hands still hurting? Will they never go back to normal? 

I'm also struggling with "baby-brain" before I would make mistakes like having to say "wanting to help because we're all people" instead of "compassion," which makes sense, but these days, I go to type "beautiful" and end up typing "people!" What gives?!

I've also still go a lot of pain down there. I gave birth naturally and it took them an hour to stitch me back up. I've healed, obviously, but the scar tissue hurts during intercourse... will it ever go away?

This is TMI (like most of the things in this post, sorry!) but what about hemorrhoids? I'm never constipated, but they just won't go away.

Ladies, does it get better or do we just sort of forget what it was like before and move on?

Thank you for your time and responses. :) 
 




 http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1367997005/733/8648733.jpg I got you a link!  




 It's Georgie!  I'm a girl. Ahahaha.  




 To be 100% honest, it's not their concern.  If they were a better fit, they would be doing it.  If they're just criticizing with no aspirations, then the manager should consider it to be noise so long as they accept that valid points may be made that contribute to personal or professional betterment.  But the truth is that a lot of times subordinates are just bored and looking for things to get upset with.  If someone has a legitimate concern, to reiterate what I said, they need to bring it to their manager.  If the manager fails to act, go above them.  It's on that next tier to decide who is qualified and who is not.  




 Maybe I clicked through your username.... maybe I did.  It's okay, though, all I did was upvote some of your more inane comments.  I consent to a similar stalking act if you feel so inclined. ;)

Sorry that board harshed your mellow, man.  




 Did you die tho?

Just kidding.  I'm loving your contributions.  The Double Double one made me spit out my soda at my desk. XD 




 Two Times:

1) You've been very explicit about your issues, but they are blowing you off.

2) It's an issue of a sensitive subject (e.g. sexual in nature) that involves them.  




 Lost in Translation.  Pretty much every scene he filmed for the whiskey commercial was priceless.  When he acted in slow motion, his goofy impression of Roger Moore, all of it.  So silly.   




 Let me start by saying that you're doing a great job.  These first few weeks are one of the strangest times of your life and you're expected to handle them on little or no sleep with a broken and recovering body.  You're so strong and you're doing such a good job.

Now let's talk about this sleep thing.  You have some valid complaints here, but you seem like a very practical and reasonable person who knows that some times you just have to let things slide.  I want you to examine why you're upset when you get upset.  Do you feel that a specific remark is insinuating that you're not working hard enough?  That you're not competent in his eyes?  It's good to understand why we feel what we feel because understanding allows us the chance to recognize when we are overreacting or being unreasonable.  This has nothing to do with you, personally, it's just human nature!  The thing is that a lack of sleep make a mountain out of a molehill.  We're more irritable and we don't feel well, that makes things seem worse.  I love that you said you don't get frustrated with your baby, but the truth is that frustration is normal, you might be putting it somewhere else, wrong or right.  Don't feel bad about it, just think about it.

Now the most important thing here is to communicate.  If he is making you feel like he thinks you are a bad mother, you should say so in a way that is matter-of-fact and as unemotional as possible.  A lot of times people just don't realize that what they're saying is hurting us.  I want you to think about something.  How often in your life have you said something with the specific intention of hurting another person?  Probably never, right?  Other people are usually no different.  If he is hurting you, he's probably not doing it intentionally, but he still needs to know how he's making you feel. 

His overreaction to the baby's perceived health problems is borne out of love, I think you know that because you are very observant.  If he's that enamored of your little man, you might just be able to convince him to go show him off.  My area hospital has pre-natal classes that are just for fathers.  These classes pair up with the new-father support group and their babies.  Daddy might just need some time with other guys who are going through the same thing, validate those feelings, and then relax.  I know we want to be all things for our partners, but sometimes we relate best to members of our own sex, you know?

This little stuff you're talking about that bothers you, it's time to employ pragmatism.  If he is questioning how you are doing something, in a nice, calm, non-emotional way, explain exactly why you are doing it.  If he suggests a different way, ask him to explain (nicely, don't confront) why he thinks that way is the best, to explain it.  If he is a man with a plan or someone who likes to know how things work, this might just short-circuit a heated situation.  

I'm sorry that you're having trouble and feeling lousy, but I'm SO PROUD of you for asking for help.  Not only just asking, but you clearly want to do what is best.  You're going to be a wonderful, wonderful example to your little person.  You're rational, caring, have a good perspective, question things that should be questioned, and most of all, you want the very best for everyone involved.  When you come from that place, you're the very best kind of caretaker.      




 Wow, now you're swearing at me.  I've been nothing but civil to you.  I apologize in advance for how angry this is probably going to make you, because it is never my intention to make someone feel bad, but I am choosing not to give a moment more of my energy.  Take care.   




 1) I was going to reassure you that attire is a lot less strict these days, but man, if it's Baptist and a small town in Texas, you should probably ask someone you know for clothes to borrow or buy something. It's a lot more normal than you might think to borrow funeral attire.  Lots of people don't have anything to wear to a funeral.

2) There are two parts that happen when a person passes away.  The visitation and the actual funeral.  The visitation is the viewing of the body.  It's usually in the funeral home itself, although in old fashioned places, it can be at a family home.  There are usually prayers recited to the group and then people go up and talk about the deceased.  It's a low pressure deal.  The funeral itself is where you go to the grave site and bury the person if that is what's happening.  Typically a man of the church will be there to say a prayer, but, again, it's not a high pressure thing you participate in.  You just stand there with your head down.

3) Totally not tacky.  I'm sure your family would love to see them.  I'd add a nostalgic little blurb about what a good memory it was if you're so inclined.  




 I'm glad I could help.  Thank you for thanking me!  It made me feel accomplished. :) 




 What I did was to put Former before their job title and company, so the reviewer would understand the connection.  If they want to know about current situation, they can ask when they call.  I formatted my line items like this:

*First Name Last Name* / Former *job title here* - *former company name* / Relationship to me (e.g. Past Direct Supervisor) / *Phone number with area code* 




 I simply don't like exercises in futility. I have rationale, but why do you deserve to know what it is?  I don't owe you an explanation.  I know in my heart that I don't believe a single thing you've accused me of thinking about men.  You can't convince me that I do.  I likely can't convince you that I don't.  So what's the point?  I kind of doubt that you have one. 

As an aside, if you really want my attention, you don't have to be a bully to get it.    




 As a companion to my response to your other question, I'd still rather be short.  I can get into spaces most people can't, I'm more resourceful, I occasionally get out of doing things I don't really want to do, I look adorable at my height, while at 5'3" I would probably be nothing remarkable.  

And I would totally date a boy who was short.  I happen to be married to someone who is 6'1.5" but let me tell you, it's pretty much just awkward in every way.  Our wedding pictures are hilarious.  My biggest (ho ho) crushes are right around 5'5". 

Edit: Although thinking about it further, I'm pretty devil may care... being 6'2" as a woman would be pretty cool insofar as it fits my personality.  I think if I were very tall, I'd be braver.  I'd still date shorter men though.  Long hair, don't care. 
 




 I'm not quite five feet tall. 

People take this as a license to rest their forearms on my shoulder as a joke.  They say things like "How's the weather down there?" which they think is funny and original but is not.  They ask me stupid things like if I'm turned away at amusement parks (no, dumbass, I'm not 4'5") and how I put pillowcases on pillows.  

The night I got married, I went out for supper with my husband, his step sister, and her husband.  I was 24, the hostess was 19 at the very most.  She said "So three adults and one child?"  Another time, while I was visibly pregnant, and 27, I went out to dinner with the CEO of my then company to a place called "Shula's."  Like Don Shula.  They brought me a menu that was printed on a regulation sized football.  My boss got a paper menu.  Yes, at six months pregnant, they STILL thought I needed a kids menu.  I am almost 30.  I have crows feet.  Are you even paying attention!?   




 What would be an acceptable answer to you? 




 I recalibrated the counterweight and set it according to your directive about the anti-skate matching the counterweight setting. I'm still having the same trouble. It is very intermittent. Like the same distance into multiple records, but not a constant issue, track three is bad, track five is terrible, track four sounds fine.... I might just need to bring it in for repairs. I'm out of my depth.  




 I'm not actually certain that the counterweight is right... it was already installed on my unit.  I'll try taking it off and putting it back on according to the instructions to be sure.  Thank you for the help.  I would have assumed that the settings on it were accurate rather than that the part might be on wrong so the settings mean nothing.  




 Can you give us any more background?  Is his mother in pain?  Is he not getting enough to eat?  Is he not interested?  Is he detaching?  What exactly seems to be the trouble here?  




 I'm not sure if you're actually asking me or just making a point, but to err on the side of optimism, no, it told me to set the counterweight at 2.  

I've looked up anti-skate and what I'm getting is that everyone has an opinion on it and I probably need some sort of test record to set it? 




 What exactly are you looking for here?  




 What is anti-skate?  Like I know where the setting is, but what does it do?  What should I be listening for it to change?  I have a 0 - 3 for that one.  My manual doesn't explain what it does, it just tells me to set it at 0.  




 How often do you ever say anything with the explicit intention of hurting someone's feelings?  I bet it's almost never if not never period.  The truth is that even the most hurtful people we have to deal with on a daily basis rarely intend to hurt us, they're just not cognizant of how they really come across.  If you feel attacked, take a moment to think if there is any possible positive place that the comment could come from.  If you can't think of any, just say in a curious, open kind of voice "I'm not sure what you mean, can you elaborate?"  If they really are being an asshole, at that point they'll get all red and sputtery and you'll come out on top.  I doubt that scenario will play out, though.  People are seriously about 10x more harmless than we can ever imagine.  




 I went ahead and did it three separate times just in case I was accidentally twisting it somehow... it's still too slow.  Could it be the pressure setting?  




 No, it's definitely the player.... My brand new Neil Young album played fine on my last set-up and it's all distorted and slow on this one, just the same as the other record, which was also brand new. :-/ 




 The third track is too slow, I'm sorry, I should have specified.  I haven't tried a different record... I'll go do that now and report directly back!  




 Hello, thanks for the fast response!  I just went in and tried it and it is the same. 




 Hello /r/vinyl ;
I got my second-hand Teac TN-300 in the mail today.  I don't have any experience with turntables, but I think the belt needs to be replaced on this one.  The first track on the record sounds fine, but when I get to the second it's intermittently the wrong speed, and the third is unlistenable... I've tried Google and looking through the Amazon reviews and the Teac website but I can't find any information on replacement parts....

Can someone tell me what kind of belt and stylus I should get for this turntable?  

I apologize in advance if these are ridiculous questions. I'm really lost! 




 Here you go, friend: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice#Ice_harvesting :) 




 While I think responding to you will probably only encourage this type of behavior, I'll take the time to point out that it was by merit of my action, a forward suggestion to contact a stranger about personal issues, that prompted my comment.  It was meant as a reassurance.  It wasn't meant as a condemnation of men in general, but a recommendation on why I might be able to help.  I'm very sorry that you took offense to my remark to the point that you needed to go to the trouble of making an account just to catch me out, but you only need go through my comment history to see that I'm interested in helping other human beings.  I'm not a man-hater.  Hopefully this susses things and you move along back to your main account.  




 I'm actually really flattered someone cares so much about me that they made an account just to send me weird replies from though.... Oh reddit, you magical place, you. :)  




 I'm not sure why this is a reply to me, man. I don't believe that at all!  




 It's nice man!  I like the leaves and the yard too!  And the color of your t-shirt is a great color with everything else.  Nice picture. :) 




 This is interesting to me.  My husband once told me that he never suggests any solutions to my problems because he simply assumes that anything he could come up with would be something I already thought of myself.  He's rather missing the point (which I've told him)... it's the act of making an effort that matters, not the outcome.  It's the same with this, the act of trusting someone enough to tell them what you really feel.  From your response, you're either someone with anxiety (like me) or you're with someone who isn't good to you.  In either case, I'm sorry that things aren't easier for you, and I hope they get better some day.  




 I think that it is infinitely more responsible than protesting abortion by carrying giant photos of aborted fetuses in public where children can see them and be scarred for life.  Too much?

I'm big on freedom of speech.  I'm big on my country.  I'm also big on personal responsibility.  Yes, I understand that it is your right to protest with photos of gore.  But should you?  Does it not contradict your whole position?  

I LOVE America.  I'm SO PROUD to be an American.  Really.  While I will be the first one up and I will sing every damn word of the Star Spangled Banner, I will not recite the pledge of allegiance.  I find worship of an inanimate object to be fascist.  And I love that because I am an American, I can talk about this with you all.  I am only too aware that my freedom has come at a cost, and so not exercising those freedoms is a crime.

Since I'm on the soapbox, vote folks.  It's important.    




 PM me if you ever want to talk.  I promise I'm not a creepy old man.  Just a girl who is close to 30 and knows what it is like to be in a problematic marriage.  




 I'm sorry. :( 




 Okay, I think I've been waiting for almost 15 years to see someone ask about this so I can say:

All or Nothing.

I have seen All or Nothing.  It has no plot, you can't understand a single thing they're saying without the captions, it's depressing, and confusing.  But sometimes I see the preview again, and it is literally such a good trailer that I think to myself... Maybe I just didn't get it the first go round.  Maybe I should see it again.

 I have a friend who lives half the way down the world from me.  

He refuses to believe that we have "not for profit" banks here (meaning a credit union).

He also refuses to believe anything about the phenomenon of Ice Harvesting. 

I've proven both things, but as he says "I believe it, but it's bullshit." 




 I don't think it has anything to do with luck, except in the way one might say our souls are placed into specific bodies, but I actually don't believe in souls.  

I think childbirth is one of those things that hasn't really been researched in the way it should be.  For example, while doctors know what to give you to induce labor, they actually have no idea what it is in our bodies that sends us into it.  Why don't they know this yet? 




 Virtual Reality by RedRover... or anything by RedRover really.... but this one is about LadyDevimon tricking the girls from 02 Digimon into entering a virtual reality with their Digimon and forcing them into about ten odd combinations of sexual assault on her and each other.    




 Stop.  Are you being serious?!

Edit: I actually don't want to know. 




 Stuffed bell peppers are too much of a pain in the ass to make unless you're making a ton of them... I'd do that!  And I'd freeze the extras. :) 




 I've got a new theme song for you : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AhKO4NXJA4

Apparently it is not so weird of a phenom that it prevented Ryan Adams from singing about it on what is arguably one of the best country albums ever written.  




 Mac, c'mon, man.  What's that first word in my reply? 




 Typically in America no "whole food" is taxed, meaning ingredients such as vegetables or oatmeal or meat.  It's only prepared and processed things that are non-essential that are taxed, like soda, chips, and fast food. 




 I like to use it in conjunction with holiday weekends.  For instance in America, Christmas is on a Friday and New Years is the following Friday.  I'd take off M-R of New years week for sure... and I'd ask for it now.  You get ten days for the price of four!   




 Oh no, you misunderstood my question, but also gave me the answer.  I mean there, because you said Tampons were, pads were not, so what are cups?  Thanks for the info, this is useless trivia I'm sure I can entertain someone with.  :) 




 Seriously though, can you let me know if the Diva Cup is taxed?  Now I'm actually curious.  




 Listen, you can't hold back your diva power when you are a stripper.... so you use le Diva Cup.  This is 101 stuff.  Cancel the revolt!  Mort le Revolution!  




 Any question whatsoever I might post in /r/vinyl 

Talk about an intimidating group.  




 Here in America, prepared food is taxed (le Cheeseburger) but grocery items (le broccoli) are not.  Tampons are the fast food of feminine products.  Off-the-cuff-theory-Thursday! Hey!  




 Snowtown 




 I'm sorry you've upset yourself so much by thinking about this... it's pretty simple, so don't worry further: It's a human survival trait to recommend ourselves to others by mimicking their facial expressions.  They see us smile, they become conscious of their ability to manipulate their facial muscles (you can stick your tongue out and raise your eyebrows at a newborn, and they will mimic you, but it is subconscious), and then they smile to recommend themselves to you.  Smiling feels good because it releases endorphins.  So they keep doing it. :) 




 Kismet.  You stop that.  I'm looking at you, alternative rock band HURT.  




 My OLD apartment.  Funny thing.  The lightbulbs kept burning out there.... So we moved.  




 Yes, your first sentence is exactly what I'm saying. 




 Team Dakota Regular 4ever.  (Yes, I'm trolling, but in a fond sort of way that I hope is endearing rather than enraging.) 




 Because if you use your caps lock and italicize it, it looks like the distinctive handwritten font used in 1960's era comics.  We need this for our satire.  




 I feel very flattered by this and some what self conscious since I'm laughing alone in my office like a crazy person.   




 Honey, the very worst thing that can happen to you is that you say the words "You know what?  That's a great question.  I'm not sure about that, but I would like to ask my supervisor.  Would you mind holding?"

I've been on every level of a call center from agent to business development.  It really is that simple. 

Your anxiety is totally normal for anyone that is starting a new job.  You will learn, and because you're so concerned about doing a good job, you will probably become a shining example faster than you think.

Good luck!  I believe in you!  




 If I weren't married, we'd be getting married.  To each other.  




 This is actually pretty simple: Beer tastes good.  Good gin also tastes good.  People don't necessarily drink to get drunk. 

It is an easy thing to feel happy in an altered state.  The hard thing is to be happy when you're just yourself.  To be able to deal with things that are uncomfortable or boring or upsetting without reaching for some crutch. 




 Thank you for telling me how you feel.  I will endeavor to use more descriptors if you ever ask me how I am and it is my impulse to say "fine." 3 




 Okay, now I have to confess the one passive aggressive thing I did that I'm, like, super proud of, indulge me, okay?: 

My old apartment had a HUGE window on one wall. The neighbor would leave the porch light on all night, so I couldn't sleep well as it was bright, and my dogs would bark at things moving in the driveway. I asked my husband to turn it off after an hour, but he didn't want to offend the neighbor. One day when the light had been on all night and all of that day, I went out with a broom and very lightly tapped the lightbulb, breaking the filament in it, so it appeared to have burned out from being on all the time. The damn thing was nine feet up, so it wasn't like they were going to change it. Ahahaha!  




 I hate to break it to you, but some of us women (like me) operate in a typical male fashion where we just say what we mean when we feel like it.  And some men are insufferably passive aggressive.  We're rarely matched with two of the same kind. ;)

If I tell you I'm fine, I actually mean I'm in a neutral place between "really great" and "not so great."  I'm telling you the truth.   




 I have inane stories for all occasions, but here is one to humor you:

My mother planted a weeping maple in our yard.  As the name suggests, the leaves hang downward on it like it is weeping.  About four months passed with this tree in our yard, and my sister came in and said, 100% serious mind you, "Mom, I think your tree is sick."  I have about 10 more stories like this between my two sisters.  




 Giving birth.  They tell you the first time it'll be 20+ hours of labor and more painful than you can imagine and that you'll probably end up needing medical intervention at some point.

I was in labor for 11 hours, pushed for 45 minutes, no drugs.  They did spend an hour stitching me back up, but I was pretty much in shock at that point, so all I remember is how I wanted to put my legs down, so what is taking so long.  All in all, I was thinking it would be MUCH WORSE.  




 Do Canadians have birth certificates?  In America, we have our fathers' names on them, linking their government identifier to ours.  Also in America, we sometimes have to bring in a birth certificate as proof of our citizenship with other things.  This might be a way to get your hands on it... 

My situation isn't exactly like yours, but my father was never a part of my life, and then when I was 12, we got word that he had passed away.  When I was 21, I managed to get ahold of his ashes without having met or interacted with anyone on that side of the family myself.  I had his name and I dug into old obituaries.  The obits list survivors which gave me leads that led to other leads on who to find contact information for. 

Good luck!  




 "A personal point of pride for me is my discipline.  I am organized and manage my time well.  While I work well in a team, independently I can be counted upon to hold myself to a standard of excellence.  I know that I would be an asset to your company, and you only need speak with me in person to see how passionate I am."  




 Talk about their feelings.  Like I get that you don't tend to feel things about petty issues, but my goodness, you must feel some things some times.... why are you just waiting for me to be able to intuit what you're thinking?  It drives me crazy that there are probably things I need to work on but because we never talk about what annoys you or what hurts you, I'll never be able to examine and grow into a better partner.   




 I'm not sure... but there is actually a whole section on the Argentina Wikipedia page about whether Arggies are actually white.  It's very weird.  




 This was a lyrical miracle.  




 I am younger.  And about a foot shorter.  I mean, I'm pretty smart, but how would she know that?  It may be because I am the direct report of the CEO who is also her immediate supervisor, but c'mon... I'm just a secretary!  I'm hardly relevant!  




 I don't know how much of this is a pretty girl problem, since I suspect it is just a short, young girl problem, but when I worked at Gamestop, I would specifically ask guys if they had any questions, they would tell me no, and then immediately make a bee-line to my male co-workers and proceed to ask them things.  

More to the point of what you're talking about here, at my current job, I've incurred a bit of pointless one-sided rivalry with one of the top level ladies.  We're decently close in age.  She was asking co-workers I went to high school with ten years ago what they remembered about me.  She never allows me to do the simple things my predecessor did for her.  She refuses to make eye contact.  She also criticizes my snack choices at board meetings to her co-workers.  I have no idea why she cares about me.  She's got three degrees, I'm in a no-ladder position, and I'm pretty nice/helpful/competent.  I think some women just tend to struggle with the idea that building someone up doesn't detract from your own merit.  It's too bad.  Building people up feels so much better.   




 We just want to drink NOS and watch Tokyo Drift in peace.  




 This isn't a television commercial, but we have two super morbid radio ads up here in MN.  One is about boat safety and we get to hear someone drown while someone narrates what is happening in that person's body as they are drowning.  The other is about going through a windshield in a car accident and what exactly is damaged and how in your body.  Both pretty unnecessary.  To add stress to dismay, the car accident one also features sirens.  So you flinch and think you're being pulled over. :-/ 




 I love the original flavor of NOS.  They even have a great website where you can put in your location and they have distributor data that tells you WHAT FLAVORS the stores carry!  The Loaded Cherry flavor is pretty awesome too.  




 If you're comfortable, can you tell me what sort of job you're applying for?  What you've got here is painfully generic and not specific to any one type of work... here is an example of a similar paragraph I wrote for my sister when she was applying as a bank teller:

I am a very service minded individual who takes pride in being able to identify the needs of others and to make sure that they are taken care of.  I am energetic, outgoing, and positive.  I love being able to improve someones day and to make people laugh.  I feel that I would be a great addition to your organization.
 




 Well, you're looking at the difference here between making an open ended statement like "Sorry, I really don't want to intrude, it's just that I've been having trouble sleeping, would you mind keeping it down at 12am," which while perfectly reasonable could still backfire on you, and a statement where you're insinuating your roommate should live his life the way you want him to "Would you mind going out instead of being here after 12pm sometimes?"  

All criticism usually ends in defensiveness no matter how careful we are with people, it's just human nature.  To be more specific though, if her husband is still hanging about and they're getting a divorce, your roommate going over there could result in him being assaulted.... who needs that on their conscience....? Even if he didn't take your advice, he'd probably think you're a bit off suggesting it.  I'd be very scared to run into a soon-to-be ex husband as a man.

I hope this didn't come off as condescending.  I swear, I'm trying to help in good will. :)  




 About a month ago or a month ago?  Most employers have a 30 day grace period in which either party may terminate your employment contract at any time. :)

Of course, you need to be respectful and grateful and apologetic.  Life happens, but if you go above and beyond to make it clear that you are only doing what you feel you must and feel very guilty about it all, they will likely harbor no ill will.  




 If you've already decided that you don't really want to mention it, you can take the path of least resistance.  I have this at my house, and it works great, you just need to make sure you put it in a central location in the room... it doesn't overpower noise, it scatters it.  It just sounds like a box fan: http://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Easy-Sound-Conditioner-Machine/dp/B00GFSF402/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1432823103 sr=8-1 keywords=white+noise+machine 




 Well, like so many things, this isn't something that someone can do for you.... make you want to live.  You have to want it yourself.  

I'm a huge believer in choosing things.  Deciding in my head and heart that I'm going to do something and leave no room for an alternative.  Being stubborn and having high level anxiety (so a fear of failure in any form) pretty much guarantees that I'll follow through.

You've said that you can't allow yourself to die and that you feel guilty for even considering it because of your parents.  It sounds like to me that a pragmatist would have grounds to see the opportunity to make a choice here.

If you don't care about yourself then give yourself over to the betterment of things.  Yes, you could choose to die, but that's selfish and will probably only guarantee that your parents will divorce at the very least, or kill themselves at the very worst. (Source: http://lighthaiti.org/the-connection-between-divorce-and-death-of-a-child.html)  That's a negative on a negative and doesn't make sense.  Instead, you should make yourself work to better things, to make life beautiful for people who can enjoy it.  I recommend volunteering for a hospice.  Many people are dying and have no family to be there with them at the end.  They are scared and they are lonely.  Government regulation mandates that 5% of all hours in hospice come from unpaid companions.  Maybe you should look into it.  




 I've actually (what a coincidence!) got to go to bed myself.... so just in case you think I might be on to something, here is a Mayo Clinic link for you... don't worry, it's not a big deal, just a blood test and some cheap pills: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothyroidism/basics/definition/con-20021179 




 I've got a book suggestion for you: "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living" by Dale Carnegie.  You need to learn how to live in day-tight compartments as Dale says.  Good luck!   




 Have you ever had your thyroid tested?  This isn't something the doctor will do unless they suspect there is a need.  If you haven't had one, and you can't afford to go right now, look in the mirror, thyroid issues will typically leave a physical clue on your neck... it will look like you have a slightly puffy collar... almost like you have a hair tied under your chin and another just above your collarbones.

 Madeline Albright!  Prague Winter was amazing!  :) 




 Could he possibly move on ahead of you?  Set things up so you can join him in a few months? 




 Have you ever invited this friend to do something in the city with you?  

You seem like a pragmatist; so I'm sure you know the answer here: Is this person someone you like enough to do stuff that's not your favorite with? If they are, compromise, say something like "Since you're always dragging me out into the woods, I figured this weekend I could lure you out for a steak and some gin here in civilization. :)" (the smiley is so you don't sound bitter when you say it)

We all have to do things we don't like for people we really like. Right now I'm stuck in the 80 degree car while my husband refuses to turn on the a/c, listening to music I don't like, and having to pretend that I care the Sox lost to the Twins today. But tonight he'll have to pretend he's not annoyed when I leave him with the baby and read in bed for a half hour. That's life! :) 




 Where you go to college isn't going to have much of an impact on who takes you on as a game warden, so if you really want to live in Maine, going to school there might be the perfect way to ensure you get a couple years in.  I mean, it's beautiful country... But there are so many beautiful places in these here United States.  You should see Oregon and Montana and Virginia State, and hell, even Northern Minnesota.  :) 




 Most states have job boards that you can sort by profession, here is the one for Maine: http://www.maine.gov/portal/employment/jobs.html

You can also check out the IFW website: http://www.maine.gov/ifw/warden_service/index.html

Here in other parts of the world, we call it the DNR or Department of Natural Resources... took me a minute to find the equivalent in Maine.  Hope this helps! :)  




 Hello.  I'm sorry that you're having such a tough time.  You seem like a hard worker who really cares about her family.  Have you looked into any housing programs in your state?  Here in MN we have a thing called 1 Roof.  If you meet a certain income guideline, you can just take a class on homeownership and prove that you can keep $1000 in your bank account for one month, and then you can get a mortgage without having to make a down payment.  They even have companion programs for if you need to do home repairs.  My advice is to look into what government assistance programs are in your area.  A lot of places also offer free financial planning assistance, so if you're struggling to budget, you can educate yourself.  I'm not sure if any of this will help you, but I hope that it does!   




 This person knows their stuff, inevitably when you are actually up there, your nerves will cause you to speak more quickly than you did when you practiced.  If you keep this in mind, you'll be able to maintain pace. :)
