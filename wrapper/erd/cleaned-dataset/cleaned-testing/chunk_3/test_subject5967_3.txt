 Because there is no force. If the bases were loaded, touching the plate would be enough. 




 Pablo rakes right handed pitching too. 




 35 




 Just bought Moneyball (book) today. Stoked to start it after the game tonight.  




 Pete Rose looks like a Cabbage Patch Doll. 




 Pablo Sandoval, you're the next contestant on "Who wants to win a $90 million contract." 




 My baseball pet peeve is when crowds boo timeouts, pick off attempts and mound visits.  




 Nothing but love for Nate. Good Giant.  




 And they say baseball is a sport for nerds... 




 Dude, that's exactly it. It's the chin and slicked back hair. 




 Welcome to AT T. Where homeruns go to die. 




 I don't care what anyone thinks, I fucking love that Jeter commercial. 




 Good, good, let the hate flow through you. 




 That's the greatest compliment you can give a baseball team.

 The $200 million contract probably makes it pretty easy. 




 It was a no win situation for Mattingly. Pulling the best pitcher alive for one of the worst bullpens in the league would have been criticized too.  




 You should come to the good side. You get one every 2 years. 




 How the hell, in a NLDS game, do they not have a camera angle from behind the base?  




 This was a must win game for the Cardinals with Kershaw and Greinke pitching games 4 and 5. Should be an exciting end to the series. 




 #I'm up all night to get Lackey!  




 AJ Ellis stole Puig's hitting ability Space Jam style.  




 I hate it when people compare Matt Carpenter to Jesus. I mean, he's cool and all, but he's no Matt Carpenter.  




 Puig is historically bad right now...I love it. 




 Someone has this exact same comment in the earlier game day thread, Even down to the same misspelling of Nielsen.  




 That's the conclusion the author of the article came to.  









 Hunter Pence hates off days so much he had the team take a dive today so the series could continue.  




 From the looks of it, they're still in their seats.  




 In the playoffs, Bumgarner turns into Kershaw and Kershaw turns into Edwin Jackson.  




 We're used to stretches of no offense. 




 Like Sherman could even be in the same conversation as Griffey Jr.  




 Ishikawa is a completely different player now than he was with us in 2010. He used to be an automatic out that played outstanding defense at first. Now he always gives a professional at bat.  




 Pablo wants that $90mil.  




 Bum took a ball off the shin? That poor baseball! 




 It's gotta be his defense. 




 What exactly does this mean for the franchise? Why should I be excited?  




 If only I could maintain an erection! 




 TBS just plays the same five commercials on repeat. 




 As opposed to Detroit, where no one has a job.  




 I loved going to trivia night at Rosie O'Grady's when I lived in San Diego.  




 I'm curious, are any non-Angels fans rooting for the Angels in this series? It seems like the Royals are everyone's sweetheart right now.  




 At this point, the only thing Josh Hamilton can hit is a crack pipe.  




 Game going 19 innings confirmed.  




 Same here. I don't have anything against the A's themselves. Their fans on the other hand... 




 If half of the salty Tiger fans in this thread had bought tickets, they probably could have come close to selling out CoMerica today. 




 Red Sox/Yankees is definitely over hyped, but when they're both competitive it's a great rivalry. It was the best in baseball in the mid 2000s and will be again someday. It's felt forced the last few years though.  




 The AL West is odd because there are no great rivalries.  A's/Angels was pretty good this year though. It probably won't last though. 




 Vertical line 




 The last resort of a fan who has given up hope. 




 I agree about the A's/Giants. Most Giants fans generally root for the A's to succeed. It seems like Oakland fans are the only ones who consider this a rivalry.  




 Remains silent 




 Is this game seriously not a sellout? That's shameful!  




 Torii has a son named Money Hunter? Dear God... 




 KC was wild for the WC game and Pittsburg was wild until Crawford hit the grand slam. Every other crowd has been a let down. Looking forward to the Royals game tonight.  




 Nah, gotta rep your city.  




 It's easy to say Zimmerman was pulled to early now that we have the benefit of hindsight, but he had just walked the potential tying run to bring Posey to the plate. It would have been Posey's fourth AB against him and he had had a few good at bats already, including a rocket to third base last time. 




 This game is going 19 innings.  




 We got dominated for 8.2 innings, but still stole this one. Feelsgoodman.jpeg  




 Whooo? 




 Hudson pitched 7.1 innings of one run ball and he's not even the best pitcher for the Giants tonight. 




 *"John, this game is not over yet."* 




 I'm telling my my grandchildren about the first 9 innings right now. 




 I don't think there's a single person outside of the LA area that doesn't have the Royals as their #2 team right now.  




 Did I glance? Please. I'm still erect from that!  




 I've never seen as much salt from a subreddit as I see in /r/angelsbaseball right now.  




 Hala wala!  




 Which scrub did the Dodgers start tonight and when do they pitch their ace?  




 That kid behind home plate will swing at anything. Madbum needs to start with the chin music and work his way across the plate. 




 Really Kruk? It wouldn't surprise you if the best hitter in the NL got a hit?  




 Somewhere in the middle of game six in the 2002 WS, I commented about how sad the fans looked. That game and series turned around right there. I'm not doing that again. 




 Madison "Dad dick" Bumgarner  




 Seriously, who has sex without being wasted?  




 Who the hell cares what Curt Schilling thinks?  




 This silence is deafening.  




 [Aye! Que lindo!]( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BjRPvHECYAAZcQ5.jpg) 




 Very good. 




 Hunter Pence prefers Hunts ketchup. 




 Likewise, Piratesbros.  




 He's been a solid bench player for us. Always has a professional at bat, has power and plays great defense ^at ^^first ^^base 




 [Let's do this!]( http://imgur.com/ZJGHNh3) 




 I'd love to face Kershaw twice in 7 games^no ^^I ^^^wouldn't 




 I've always been a fan of logos that include the letters of the team's city. It seems like the NL has more of that. 




 Can we have a moment of appreciation for MLB Network? After being raised on ESPN, it's such a refreshing change. 




 If it should come to it, rather than extra innings, the game should be decided by a competition between left fielders. Whoever is better at shagging grounders at 1st wins. 




 Best of luck, Piratesbros! I've never been a believer in having number 2 teams, but if I had to pick one, it would be you.  




 Let's just end the season after this game. No one can top this. 




 Time to send back the "Always October" sweatshirts.  




 Alright, I think we've all established that we don't like the announcers. We can talk about something else.  




 Ernie seemed so bored during that home run call I assumed it was a lazy fly ball to center. That made it all the more shocking.  




 #BOOM. YOASTED.  




 Best bullpen in the league.  




 Son, there are some things you should know about Missouri... 




 Something tells me we're not watching the future WS champions tonight.  




 It's fitting that a Marlins fan is confused by an excited crowd.  




 You jelly, bro? 




 Not until the bottom of the ninth in game 7 of the WS.  




 Unless there's two of them, Bridges is right by SDSU. They are offering $3 beers for anyone in Giants gear.  




 I feel like I should be excited, but I don't know what this means. Can anyone enlighten me?  




 2006 @ Miami 21-0 




 It's like watching the end of an era.

 A's fans are like that younger sibling who is living a very successful life, but obsesses over their more successful older sibling.  




 That's a routine 9-4-2-3.  




 It's in the box score as a double, because he was thrown out going back to second. I just don't know how to show that he was retired.  




 How do I score that Belt double at home?  




 Says a lot about Jeter that he can get a standing ovation from the fans he absolutely tormented for 20 years. Baseball won't be the same without him.
