 Zero consequences. The ending of Taken pissed me off so bad.  




 25th Hour 




 Just say "3". Say it.

^^^SAY ^^^IT 




 This picture had to have been taken today or yesterday. We never get snow. 




 Dude, that's his daughter. 




 That's also (hopefully) their order from worst to best. 




 You need to add "Because that's how you get ants!" 




 That's fucking awesome. I want one.  




 Some crazy, awesome shit goes on in Seaside, man. Last fall break, 18 different kids from my high school got arrested on different occasions.  




 That's it. Thanks. Was driving me crazy. 




 Just say 2 years.  









 You really want to be the guy who fucks the date guy? Nobody fucks the date guy. 




 But then you'd just be that weird guy that always carries dates. 




 That's fucking bullshit. That's Chic-Fil-A and you fucking know it, don't you? 




 Don't let the doc fool you though. The guys a fucking asshole.  




 You don't? 




 You look like a pudgier Paul Dano.  




 [Make Her Say](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmSV2cim0Qg) 




 You resemble Will Forte 




 Well shit. I was about to link you to Boogie2988's YouTube channel because your situations sounded so surprisingly similar. 




 Yes, and...? 




 You sound like a character from a teenage soap opera.  




 [Rorschach's Attempted Shanking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3lsJmwNO40#t=7) 




 Was recently blown away by **Prisoners**
* Hugh Jackman
* Jake Gyllenhaal
* Viola Davis
* Maria Bello
* Paul Dano
* Terrence Howard
* Melissa Leo

There was no weak link. Everyone was perfect in their roles. I was surprised when I realized it had gotten little to no Oscar nods. 




 You think wrong.  




 I expected this to be a Blade Runner reenactment with snails. 




  being able to be who you want to be

"B - A - R - B - I - E" 




 Do. That was surprisingly heart-wrenching.  




 Don't think they're high as much as they're probably just bored to tears during a long-ass press junket. Still funny though.

Edit: Got three minutes in or so. Totally high. 




 He had to have planned it. Otherwise he wouldn't have been wearing the hat and glasses and overcoat. Plus, he knew he had to get do it eventually.  




 You and /u/chubbo55 might go to the same uni.  




 It just got cancelled, but I highly recommend season 1 of Hello Ladies with Stephen Merchant. Incredibly funny, especially if you loved the "cringeworthy" awkward moments of The Office. 




 Trisha and Ross are my least-favorite hosts for news, but my favorites on table talk. 




 If you had a million-dollar-an-episode budget, what myth would you test first? 




 "Hi, my name is God and I like to party.  




 I met Macklemore about a month ago. He was really quiet and all alone in a store in NYC. He seemed super sad and he looked tired as dicks.  




 Looks like I'm going with this. Thanks. 




 Oh yeah. One of my favorite "mind-fuck" movies. 




 Se7en is one of my favorites. Looks like im watching TGWTDT. 




 I have a kid in my class who talks like doge in public.

Everyone hates him. 




 If you are in for a longer ride and have Netflix, watch the BBC series "Luther" starring Idris Elba. Judging by the movies listed, we have similiar taste. I promise it wont let you down. It's incredibly well acted, written, and directed, and has some amazing cases and killers. The last two episodes of season two were up there with Se7en and Prisoners. Really good stuff. 




 The Strangers is the cheesiest horror movie ever. It makes no sense and it sucks. 

That came across very terse and rude. I just have strong opinions about how shitty that movie is. 




 He says, having already clicked on a close up photo of the gaping head of a penis.  




 You wouldn't need to.  




 Philip Seymour Hoffman was. Not just saying that because he just passed, but the man made great choices with his roles. I've never been disappointed with a movie he's been in. 




 Well if it's just a picture of someone warming their spoon so they can scoop their ice cream better then the caption doesn't make much sense does it. 




 I watched Punch-Drunk Love last night and she played Adam Sandler's abusive sister. Wish he would've just salted the bitch. 




 He OD'd on heroin. This is someone prepping heroin for use.  




 SHUT SHUT SHUT SHUT 




 This isn't fucking offbeat.  




 Thanks. That's a high goof count. 




 This guy! I like the way he thinks! 




 Can any of you cowards direct me to an episode where Amir says "goof"?  




 ...so he did Die Hard? 




 Where can I buy one? 




 Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Robert Ford

Inglorious Basterds

Se7en

Fight Club

Burn After Reading

Snatch

Twelve Monkeys

True Romance

Benjamin Button



Well shit. Looking back at it the guy has an amazing track record. 




 Directed by Alfonso Cuarn's crazy Thai cousin. 




 I am pretty upset that the entire cast of Hustle got Oscar nominations, yet no one from Prisoners did. EVERY performance in that movie blew me away. 




 /r/MoviePosterPorn  




 Fuck off, Jim Crow.  




 He's in a huge war movie blockbuster coming out this summer with Brad Pitt. So probably just a few months.  




 Can someone link me to the proper images? I'm getting a giant red banner than says "DANNY - are my bitch - you will obey" 




 Is there one of these for each state?

Same thing happened to me at Pet Smart.  




 Well fuck. Fuckity fuck.

This one? 




 I know it's not going to happen, but Fassbender is such a suave bastard. 




 Craig's got 2 more movies left. I think they'll go with a relative unknown, although I pray for Fassbender. 




 I love it. The only thing I would change is that I would allow his hair to breach the border and not be cut off. It might give it a more three dimensional look. I'm just nitpicking because you asked though, I think it's awesome.  









 Try /r/tipofmytongue. They're great with these kind of things. 




 [This is a screenshot off of her YouTube. I couldn't find a better picture.](http://imgur.com/XTjVhyq) 









 She had to cut most of it off after complications that came from what they had to do to it when filming American Hustle.

 So he doesn't have to think about it. 




 it isn't irrelevant because you say it is. 




 It's relevant.
