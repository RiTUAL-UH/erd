 Although I like all of them I think I'm still leaning towards DGM. White and Blue are awesome but they're so overdone, literally everyone has one of those two colors. 




 Nice! I'm in Ontario too :D 




 I'm about to purchase a 16' STi Sport and can't decide on the color. I have it down to WRB, White, or DGM. I'm leaning towards DGM but not 100% sure yet. What do you all think? 




 Was also wondering, how much were the protective measures you took at the detail-er if you don't mind me asking?   




 Is this the DGM? Been debating what color to get for my STi. This really makes me lean towards your color lol 




 My Impreza is white, does the fact that the interior is red/black bother you? lol. I'm down to either white, blue or DGM. 




 My current Impreza is Satin White and I love it, although it gets dirty so easily  




 I normally don't like blue but the STi is an exception, really speaks to the Subaru heritage. Although the black/red interior makes me OCD run wild as it doesn't go with blue at all IMO lol 




 glad you got it working :) 




 congrats! I'm picking up one myself soon. Still can't decide between wrb or white.
