 I'm calling this now, and I hope I'm wrong, but I'm worried they're going to screw up the scene of Tyrion strangling Shea.

Either it won't happen at all, or it'll be a lot more tame. Seems like something the producers would deem "too brutal" for one of the show's hero's to do. 




 It's not the same company. Squaresoft is dead. The franchise has changed and will never be the same. We must look elsewhere. 









 That's awesome- congrats  




 Going by how many rings Eli churns out I'd say he's making the most of that dough, compared to let's say...Aaron Rodgers. 




 Cool! 




 Specifically I'm looking to buy some protein powder. Is there somewhere I can go to get a reasonable deal on this? Or is taking the train all the way uptown to Cosco my only option? 




 Tuck rule. 









 Do you have a link to fangraphs write up on him? 

Can't find it. 




 Concerned the tofu may go bad, only cooked with it a few times. 









 My girlfriend wants to start gymmin it regularly and has asked me to help her along. I consider myself pretty well versed in the fitness world, yet find myself a little at a loss when approaching advise for her. Is there a specific routine someone can link me to that I can read up on, or just advise in general. As far as her goals: lose weight and tone up, generally just be healthier.

Thanks! 




 The best sushi I've had in manhattan is at Sen (flatiron district), keep it mind it's a bit expensive.

As far as cult videogame stores, can't go wrong with 8bit on St. marks.  




 Found a still image of it: http://www.edmontonjournal.com/sports/cms/binary/9764915.jpg 




 After Lawrie's three run jack, he's dapping people up in the dugout, reaches Melky, and the two of them grab eachother by the sides of the head and just start screaming excitedly at one another. It was so hilarious to watch, and I can't for the life of me find this anywhere. Help would be most appreciated- go jays! 




 Vonnegut. 




 If you're into historical fiction, Colleen McCullough is a BOSS. Highly recommend her masters of rome series. 




 If you dig scifi, I'd recommend Stranger in a Strange Land- pretty hilarious but also has some great commentary/insight on humanity in general.

For literary comedy though, everyone should read A Confederacy of Dunces at some point. 




 I realize requesting a suggestion like this is a reach, but I can't help trying to scratch this itch. Recently re-watched the film Eyes Wide Shut, and was curious why I hadn't heard of a book which was similar. This seems like such an intriguing topic to me. I know there are many mystery/crime novels set in New York City, but I'm looking for something that focuses more on "high society" so to speak.

Thanks! 









 Turn off the inner monologue. Be yourself, be jovial, don't give a fuck. 




 Just as bad.  




 I'd rather have mccutchen and iwakuma. Elite offensive talent is much harder to come by than good pitching, iwakuma's numbers last year were terrific- I'd give him a chance first this year.

Don't do the deal. 




 My post is in response to this injury news. Fresh off the surgery announcement I don't see how his value could get any lower. 




 What you guys think? Was going to offer Melly Cabrera for him. 




 Watching on gamecast-can someone describe what happened? 




 Keep an eye on this guy Karnes they've got. Was competing for a role during spring. Has a tremendous K/9 rate in the minors. I'd prefer him over bedard/ramos. 




 Hey Mike,
Great job on your columns. Razzball's the best fantasy website out there.

Assuming Matt Moore's elbow injury is serious, who do you see taking over the role in the rotation for the rest of the season? 




 In a heartbeat! 




 I'd do it. Ventura could be a ROY ace, Hamels could suffer from shoulder issues all season. Fantasy baseball is all about taking gambles- I think this is one worth making. 




 Dawg you gotta have Wong on your squad. 




 Keep kershaw. 




 I like your team, nice work.

I'd say freese/gee could be dropped depending on the talent available via waivers. 




 Great post!

Refreshing to see one of these on this sub. 




 I'd do it 




 I'm weary of Perkins simply because he's on the twins. They aren't going to win a lot of games this year, thus less save opportunities. Soria/Johnson are top of my list this year. 




 Scheppers/Quintana. I like Josh Johnson in the long haul but he's most likely gonna be DL'd for about a month. 




 People are high on him this year. You don't want to log onto reddit tomorrow morning and see the post "Some fool just dropped Fister, who do I get rid of for him."

To my knowledge it isn't a sever injury. If it's your first year and you're not that comfortable make trades, place him on your league's trading block and let the offers come to you. Any offer you get you can consult with this subreddit and typically get good advice. 




 I'd take Rollins, Jeter, A Escobar, and Gordon over him. If you already have Baez, without question keep him stashed. 




 I'd hold on to him- I'd be shocked if you couldn't find someone interested in trading for him. 




 Every team in an 8 person league looks stacked, too difficult to rate. My guess is clever trading is what wins you the title. 




 Hard to make a decision surrounding someone as risky as Abreu. Let's say he lives up to part of the hype and puts together a good first half- then yes the trade is worth it. Your rotation is strong enough to lose Cobb, however I'd wait and see what Abreu is first.  




 Definitely a solid team- congrats. Who's available on the waiver wire at SS? 




 Without knowing anything about your league, I'd find a top level outfielder you want, and offer that owner Posey + Mediocre Outfielder you own(say a cuddyer).

Would be easier to answer this question by showing the rest of your team, scoring system, and the outfielders that you want. 




 Kolten Wong and Neil Walker are better than both those fools. 




 I like the trade for you. You come out with tremendous rotation depth. Can butler go in a utility spot? Even if he can't, he can be a top of the line bench warmer, or package him in a trade to get an outfielder. 




 1. Hutchinson

2. Alvarez

3. De La Rosa 




 Thanks for the response!

So you'd recommend starting Davis over Cuddyer regardless? 




 I like loney, but best bet is going on a matchup by matchup basis. 




 H2H 6x6

My rotation needs the upgrade- should I do this trade?

I'd be replacing Cuddyer with Khris Davis. 




 Yeah you'd be getting raped, segura is top 3. 




 I think pablo sandoval is poised to have a monster season, you could probably buy him cheap off someone. 




 Whoa "Law of the Wolf" cover is guaranteed to give me at least several nightmares. These are impressive- inspiring collection thanks for sharing. 




 When I say "cue" it means it's something I'm anticipating. If I'm wrong, then that's a good thing. 




 Indy fans have a history in this sub of blindly defending him, I'm glad they're not living up to my expectations. 




 Cue all of these Indy fans defending him. I'm so sick of this classless owner. What if he killed someone? Born with a silver spoon in his mouth and can't take it off the bottle. An embarrassment to the organization. I'd take Snyder/Jerry over him any day. 









 I chuckled solemnly, whilst shaking my near perfect visage at the panel of self-proclaimed specialists, "The decision, my fellow mortals, falls into your laps, not mine."

The stirs of uneasiness crept along the semi circle of listeners in waves, from those dimwitted enough to have to think on my words and those who already shared my thoughts.

I smiled. An amused, sardonic, smile, one the writers of this moment would most assuredly classify as evil.
The panel speaker cleared his throat, "Could you expand on that response a bit, Sir?"

A cigarette of some sort would certainly make this upcoming monologue of mine more dramatic. I sighed, regretfully. "You see, gentleman and gentleladies, you look upon the most cutting edge technology produced by the natural phenomena known as evolution. This is what the new human looks like as we stare straight ahead into the brittle future of humanity. You ask me to sacrifice myself. In order to save those that must be left behind simply do to the natural order of humanity. You ask to stunt the growth of evolution, in order to selfishly save yourselves from your DNA-ordained fates. Now, I could fall onto my instinct of self preservation in order to justify my refusal, but it would be disingenuous to lie to the lesser breed like that. The moral quandary you see, is not mine, but yours. Will our society allow you to murder every evolutionary breakthrough our species has in order to preserve the flawed masses?"

My mouth held a taste of metallic and hot blood. I craved the cigarette now not for vanity's sake but to cover the death which permeated my glands. The stares that met my eyes, and the stares which gazed deep into the future had already answered the question. And I amazed myself at how instantly arrogance can transform into fear. 




 Great call, thanks 









 At some point the articles coming out aren't going to be discussing how it can be fixed, but rather when we should accept it's doom. Final Fantasy is dead. It isn't the same people that made these games, it's not that same power company that was churning out all those gems of games in the late 90s. Obviously opinion matters a great deal here. If you're somebody who loved playing XIII, that's awesome and I'm happy for you- just keep in mind that it's not 'Final Fantasy' by the standard they set long ago. So many of the 'positive' comments I read about the game are "I didn't mind it", "I thought it was pretty good"- a Final Fantasy game should make you stop playing for a moment and say, "This is amazing". 




 I found that whenever I was at work browsing this subreddit, I'd get super motivated to exercise. Just seeing discussion about fitness gets me pumped. Whenever I'm losing steam I pop open my alien blue app and start reading through threads. Works great for me, thought I'd share in case it helps any of you all.
Cheers. 




 Does this have any relation to the videotape, Parasite Eve?
