 Thank you guys so much for your help!  It worked :D

But now I've noticed I have another problem, and that is when I open my blog on my Ipad, the menu drops down fine, and I can click on colorado and nevada, but california doesn't seem to work.  I click and click.. but it doesn't take me anywhere.  helpp :D

edited to add the new problem 




 Hi!  I have a photoblog http://www.test_subject6067.com and I just added the travel-at a glance page on the nav bar.  I made it a parent page to two other pages (California, Nevada), and I would like it to just drop down instead of always taking you to the parent page.  I'm not sure if I'm making any sense lol but any help would be appreciated.  Thank you! 




 If you make cold process soap, you could puree them without the seeds/stem and make pear soap!  I do that with fruit all the time.  Or maybe put the puree on your face like a fresh fruit face mask. 




 Yup I'm a girl :D  Best I can do is use my experience with shaving my legs.  Even then, I'm not using a brush so I have no idea the kind of luxurious foam everyone talks about when it comes to shaving your face.  




 I agree, most of the shaving soaps people seem to recommend are all tallow based.  I have met lots of people that were allergic to lanolin, so perhaps offering some with and some without would be the best choice.  ty! 




 I love buying handcrafted soaps as well.  I just call it "product research" ahahahah.   




 thank you for the tip on the puck being too small.  I had never considered that being an issue.  TY! 




 Scent right now isn't what I'm thinking about.  Just creating a great base is #1 :D
 




 Tallow definitely turns many people off, but I have noticed that popular shaving soaps all have it.  There are vegetable oils that give vegan soaps a similar lather so I'll definitely be testing out lots of recipes.  I agree samples is king! lol 




 I will definitely try using a brush and a razor to shave my legs to test out the quality of the lather.  And I definitely agree with you on the adding bentonite clay and calling it shaving soap phenomenon .  All it seems to do is add a little slip.  Definitely not the great lather I've seen on many youtube videos demonstrating shaving soap.  Thank you for the advise :D  




 Thank you so much!  Many of the oils used to make a foamy, bubbly soap can be drying.  That's why it's a balancing act.  I really appreciate the help :D 




 Hi illsolvethat!  Thank you for helping me out.  I love using grassfed tallow!  Soaps made with tallow gets lots of great foam.  I was wondering, is moisturizing an important aspect to a shaving soap?   




 Hi everyone!  I've been a soap maker for 10 years and recently decided to start selling.  I would love to make some great shaving soaps to add to my line.  Since I don't have a beard, I'm not really sure what makes a great shaving puck.  There are lots of glycerin soaps that give extra lather, but do you guys think that they perform well enough? Do you guys have a preference when it comes to an all veggie soap or one made with tallow or lard?  Do you like a soap puck that comes in a container already or prefer a puck by itself?  Thank you guys so much!   




 90% of the time I use self checkout, a cashier still has to come over to punch in codes or something...  




 Hi everyone!  I've been keeping a worm factory worm bin on my balcony for the last 3-4 years very successfully.  I've always seen a couple of maggots in my bin, but not a lot.  I just pick them out and toss them.  Suddenly in the last 2 months there's been more but today I just checked and I couldn't find any worms in the top 2 bins!  Everything I see moving are small maggots!  Now.. I'm not sure exactly what I should do.  If I stop feeding them I'm afraid that my worms will starve (I think they are already) but there seems to be too many for me to pick out.  Any help would be appreciated :D 




 Progressive insurance.  Ehhh Flo...  




 Ripping the warning tag off stuff...freaked me outttt 




 Omg yes! I like soy sauce + finely minced garlic on mine.  Delicious! 




 Hi guys! I had a quick question regarding batting.  I'm really interested in starting to quilt but wasn't sure where I should buy batting that has the best prices.  I've looked at Joann's, Walmart, Michaels.. but wasn't sure if there were other options.  Any help would be appreciated :D 




 We reuse all of our plastic bags from grocery stores as trash bags or as doggy poop bags.  Now.... we are just going to have to buy more plastic bags.  Danggg 




 YES!  And I loved how the upstairs bedrooms all opened to the outside balcony and not an indoor hallway.  The outdoor shower was pretty fantastic too.   




 I shot there a few times.  It's a beautiful property.  At the time he was building a movie room and a party room... I wonder if those are finished.   




 Yes this please!!!  




 Your brother is freaken hilarious on Dexter!  Yay for a funny Asian guy on a hit show :D  




 OMG please please fire him.  I can not stand Benjy anymore.  I don't know if it's cause he's getting older?  If Elisa is driving him crazy, but Benjy is just becoming more delusional and less funny rapidly. 




 I want to like her...but sometimes she is really irritating on the show.  She has no clue that she comes off as being really annoying and that makes me feel kind of bad for her.  The worst was when she kept apologizing to Benjy by saying " I'm sorry you were offended " EHH!!!  




 Yeah definitely a bigger cab with our luggage and carry ons. 




 We will be on the east coast so there will be 2 full sized luggages and 5 carry ons along with purses, etc.  I figure pulling everything during rush hour can't be fun.  It does seem like getting a larger cab and splitting it is cheaper than renting a shuttle for $20 a head.   




 Yes I agree, I'm almost 100% sure we'll just take a bus to AC.  AC to DC... we might just rent a car and split it.  Now I"m just trying to figure out the toll roads situation.  I don't even have an idea of about how much it will cost since it looks like we'll be hitting up 3-4 toll stops. 




 Well there's definitely no deadline to DC.  I've just looked from google maps and it seems like we'd have to transfer a few times.  The idea of us dragging our luggage around seems like it may turn into a lot of work... hahahaha 




 The Greyhound seems to only take 2 hours 30 minutes so it's not too bad, but it's 5 hours to get to DC from Atlantic City since it goes through Philadelphia.  I will definitely check Ri Ra!  I'm not sure if we'll be leaving the boardwalk area but thanks for the tips :) 




 I did see that Amtrack is SUPER EXPENSIVE.  I would LOVE to take the train but wow.. the prices.  I do think that renting a car would work.  I used google maps and saw that there are a few toll roads we would hit if we were to drive to DC.  Is there a website I could check how much the tolls would cost? 




 I think we'll Greyhound it to Atlantic City.  The free slot play is pretty tempting.. lol.  As for getting to DC... I saw that the bus takes 5 hours, but driving would only take 3.... so many things to consider.  




 The only shuttles I found cost $20 per person. 




 Hello East Coasters! 5 of us will be in NYC till Friday and wanted to check out Atlantic City before we leave.  I wanted to know if you guys had any tips on how to get there from Times Square.  I saw that there are a few bus options and was thinking about trying Greyhound's Lucky Streak.  Is that a good choice?  

After a fun Friday in Atlantic city, we will have to travel to DC on Saturday and needed a recommendation on how to get there.  Are there bus options?  Should we subway it?  Rent a car? Any tips would be appreciated! Thank you ahead of time :D 




 lefferts = awesome.  Thank you for your tip :D 




 Thank you so much!  $58 + tip is not bad... and would definitely be easier than jumping on subways with all our luggage.  I'm afraid we'll get ripped off cause they can tell we're out of towners lol 




 Hi guys! 5 of us are traveling to NYC this coming Monday and wanted to know what is the best way to get from JFK airport to our hotel in Times Square.  We will have luggage and there's 5 of us so I figured getting regular cab would be impossible.  I would love any tips you guys can offer.  Thank you! 




 You're photogenic! I must be really ugly in person :( 




 Maybe you can get a detachable shower head and hold it on your head while tilting your head backwards.  Less water dripping down your face! 




 Immigration policy?
