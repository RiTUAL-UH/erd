 You have a responsibility to your students to keep the environment of your class safe and conductive to learning. Having someone who is not participating can be distracting and throw off the energy of the practice. I think you did the right thing, have you checked with other co workers to see if it has been an issue in anyone else's class? 




 I would start by considering what you are looking for in a teacher and a practice, is there a style you prefer? Or are you searching more for a teacher you vibe with?
I don't care for the brand lulu lemon, but the people who work in the stores tend to be pretty in sync with the yoga community. That may be a place to get started. 
Best of luck to you! 




 Teaching is the hardest, most time consuming, and difficult thing I have ever done, but I wouldn't do anything else. My mentor said something great to me , I can teach you how to make a lesson better I can teach you to manage a class, but I can't teach you to love kids. I think thats what makes a good teacher, it is how much do you care about your students . I love my kids so I push myself to make better lessons , I make sure I do everything I can to help them succeed, and I make sure they know how much I care. I have seen teachers who go into teaching because they love their content area , and those teachers burn out quickly , because no matter how much you love math if you don't like kids it won't be worth it in the end. Hope that helps some best of luck. 




 Thanks for the info, not trying to lose weight  (I am 5'7 130 lbs) but I just noticed that I have a lot of sugar in my diet, I love baking , and dark chocolate. I have a strong family history of type 2 diabetes and while I don't have any risk factors now I would like to try and tame my sweet tooth before it becomes a problem.  




 I'll keep you posted on how it is going.  




 So I would like to give up foods with added sugar in my diet for the next 30 days. I was wondering if anyone would like to join me, or if anyone has advice on getting rid of added sugar?
Edit People have been asking why I want to do this, it is partially because of a family history of type 2 diabetics, but also because of the other health issues that seem to be related to added sugar. I AM NOT TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT, just trying to feel better and hopefully reduce my risk for disease. Also thanks for all the support r/vegan  




 There are different certifications for yoga teachers, and they are typically done by hours 200 hour 500 hour ect. I am not sure how they measure the hours though. 




 I am learning so much ab electricity from this thread 




 yes , but most people die at a certain voltage , because of a skin mutation he can withstand, and have a fair amount of control over electricity

 If you meet someone who is great date them, if you are happy being single and no one strikes your fancy then be single. I will say that dating in college is like an experiment and it is likely that at no other point in your life you will have as many variables. i.e. there are many different types of people to date in college and this can help you figure out what you are looking for. I had one of my worst boyfriends while I was in college followed by one of the best. College is about figuring out who you are and what you want out of life if you want to do that by your self great if you meet someone to share in your adventure of self discovery then thats great too. Hope that was helpful. 




 I started a new job that I love.
I met the love of my life.
I moved into my first place by myself. 
My SO and I moved in together and then 2 weeks later he got a great job opportunity 6 hours away and he moved out , now we are doing the long distance thing 




 I was never overweight, but I lost 10 pounds by going vegan ( I was already a vegetarian), cutting back on the wine I drink , and hitting up the gym 3 to 4 times a week. I did all of these things to feel better not to really to lose weight  but small changes add up.  




 Daiya vegan cheese , cheese was the one thing that was super hard for me to give up and nutritional yeast only does so much. I love Daiya it melts it is yummy and I can have a grilled "cheese" with tomato soup. 




 thanks ! 




 I loved psyc, but I got out of college and I was bar tending to make ends meet, I had planned to go to grad school and become a counselor but I wanted to take some time off. Part of being a bartender is talking to people listening to problems I was good at it but I was exhausted by it (I am sure that the 12 hour shifts didn't help) and you can't really offer any real solutions, you can just listen .I figured I needed get a better feel for if I wanted to be a counselor, I started working for a crisis hotline that too left me feeling burnt out. I went a head and applied to grad school , a few psyc programs and a couple education programs . I got into a few schools and I decided to go with education , I had a real tough time when I was in middle and high school , and it would have been much worse if it wasn't for a few out standing teachers. I felt this was a way for me to help people , that was sustainable for me. I love my job , it is very challenging, and time consuming, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.  




 Well I teach high school now, so some times I accuse my students of having Landau-Kleffner Syndrome, a disorder where children forget how to express themselves or understand their native language. 




 I suppose I could be delusional, but I am very aware that it is just for fun in my own mind, and that the majority of people aren't suffering from a psychological disorder.  




 BS in psyc MA in education 




 Abnormal psychology, I got a psyc degree before I became a teacher and spent a lot of time studying abnormal psyc. I found it fascinating and terrifying at the same time. I have a deep seeded fear I'll get dissociative fugue at some point in my life. I also secretly diagnose everyone with very mild forms of psychological disorders in my head just to keep myself from forgetting the symptoms. 




 but why ? Are their genes that tell them to move back ? 
How come bones don't move after they are set ? 




 yes link please 




 So I understand that braces are put on to straighten teeth, but why when the braces come off do some teeth move back to their original placement unless people continue to wear retainers? 




 I am a teacher so I am on my feet all day, I love the look and feel of leather shoes , but not the suffering. I have bought many Vegan "leather" shoes, but they tend to fall apart, give me blisters, and look a bit cheap. Please help me find some stylish, comfortable, and durable shoes for the new school year! 




 I find the most effective argument to go vegan is, to show people that you are happy and healthy. People always ask why I choose to eat this way and I tell them because of the environment and animal cruelty, I typically leave it at that, but I may say if they are interested to check out book x or documentary z. Its not preachy it encourages them to seek out their own answers. It also doesn't hurt that I am lean, unfortunately a lot of women are only interested in veganism because they think they will lose weight (case and point skinny bitch)
Oh and Peta has lost all credibility in most people's minds so it doesn't matter how loud they scream no one wants to listen. 




 Pros everything stays pretty clean, you can have sex where ever you want, lots of privacy
cons you don't have someone to keep your pet company when you aren't home, no one to vent to about your day, those weird noises you hear at night can't be blamed on your roommate...so I think that someone is breakinginto my house a lot more 




 Just found out my SO will be moving 6 hours away, I would like to hear your tips, and stories about how to make it work.  




 Hey I just finished my first year teaching gov and econ at a title one school, I would be happy to send you a post card and lesson ideas , for your class.  




 Al gore ...robot voice 




 When I was in high school I went to a ci cis pizza buffet, my friends and I had gotten our plates and started to eat.I got some sauce on my mouth and reached for a
 napkin out of the dispensers.30 or so little roaches started crawling out of the napkin holder and on to the table. My friends and I began to scream the manager came over to see what was wrong , he calmly picked up the holder and took it in the back their were still roaches crawling everywhere so we ran out , and never came back. 




 I'm guessing that if she is 23 then she just finished her first year of teaching,   so here are a few things I would have loved after my first year teaching(some of these are more romantic than others) 
A trip to a museum, or historical site ( teach history, but this could be adapted to any subject or any interest)
Replace some sort of technology that she uses daily ( printer, laptop, Ipad, etc)
Or just plan an evening with her , take her to dinner, go dancing, check out a band, sometimes as a teacher it is just really nice to have someone else plan things to do. 
Hope this was helpful, you sound like a thoughtful boyfriend 




 Ear plugs and an eye mask, in college everyone has such different schedules these things can save you if you have an exam the next day and your neighbors/ roommates are being loud...or if you are hungover and need to sleep it off while the rest of the world buzzes about. Speaking of hangovers keep gatorade or coconut water on hand drink half of it before you go to bed after a night of drinking and the other half in the morning, it helps take the edge off. Bonus if you can get the extra electrolyte packets that gatorade makes , check with your friends who are in the athletic trainer program.

 Octopuses have three hearts two are used for general blood flow and one is used for their organs.
edit a word 




 Are you kidding me I encourage my seniors to become welders, or go into construction, if they know they dont want to go to traditional college, the military and police academy always come up for options too. Teachers need to realize not everyone wants to go to college not everyone needs too. Sorry your teacher said that welding is a great career.
