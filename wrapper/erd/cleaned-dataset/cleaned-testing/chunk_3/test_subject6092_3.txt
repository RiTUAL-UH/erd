 The kid I was playing against has Peyton Manning, Andy Dalton (both on byes) so he picked up Big Ben and Eli Manning (you start 1 QB) and he started Eli. At least he has 2 empty starting roster spots...  




 Started him over Jay Cutler who has been great so far this season... Well not doing that anymore. This kid in our league has 4 QBs too so the QB depth for a backup is light.  




 I have Antonio brown Alshon Jeffry Victor Cruz Marques Colston and Julian Edelman. I found it easy I part ways with sanders and welker  









 Some friends and I were having lunch or dinner on a rainy day at my favorite chain restaurant when suddenly I heard an explosion and a few screams. I looked outside the window and saw some smoke and then heard more explosions and off in the distance I saw a lot of smoke coming from an old factory in the distance with tall smokestacks. The smoke was coming from the building itself and not the smokestacks. More explosions came and suddenly the smokestacks began to crumble down and then it was clear what was causing this. Oddly enough it seemed like fireworks were going off and there were so many of them that it was doing serious damage to this building. Sooner than later the while building was reduced to rubble and the fireworks stopped. After this we left the restaurant and I went to a house where these three girls were. I only recognized the face of one of the girls, but she was the only person of significance in this part of the dream. It was clear that she was interested in making sexual advances with me, but I wasn't taking advantage of them even though in real life I find this girl really attractive. 


I've never had a dream like this where so much happened and I was hoping someone could interpret this or help with an interpretation. I really don't even dream that often - maybe once a month.  A lot of what I think are minuscule details were left out, but if you have any questions let me know! Thank you.  




 Standard ESPN scoring: Sanders (SEA), Welker (SEA) and Colston (MIN). Pick 1. Thank you.  




 It is so crazy! I don't understand Arizona! 




 So I've got my flex options this week between Julian Edelman, Andre Ellington, Mike Asiata and Desean Jackson. It's a standard espn league. I'm leaning Ellington because I think it's clear he will play and provides the most upside.  




 Yeah I try hard to not be that guy. Thanks. 




 Alright,  I'll definitely hang on to him. Thanks.  




 Pick that guy up! 

Edit: I might have made an unintentional pun that could have been taken the wrong way.  









 I would go with Matt Ryan. You've got a beautiful QB situation here though. Can't really go wrong, but I like Matt Ryan more because he's go better targets around him and Cinci seems to give up a lot of yards.  




 The potential of Cruz would be enough to have me start him. Arizona does have a nice secondary, but Cruz is able to light it up if he gets the touches. 




 I would go with Decker. I think he has the better situation around him to score points. 




 Standard espn scoring: Marques Colston vs Cleveland, Julian Edelman vs Minnesota, victor Cruz vs Arizona, desean Jackson vs Jacksonville, Emanuel sanders vs KC,Alshon Jeffries vs San Fran. Pick 2 




 Standard scoring: Locker vs Dallas or Cutler vs San Fran. Seems like Locker is the better bet here, but I would like another opinion.  




 I've been feeling awfully shitty whenever I'm alone or not with people I know. This feeling started at work about 2 months ago and once in awhile I would find myself really in the dumps outside of work, but not too often. The longer time went on I would feel worse and worse outside of work. The last 3 weeks or so it's become so prominent in my life the only time I escape it is when I'm with friends. Even then I get an occasional feeling of hate for myself. I've been getting about 3 headaches a day the past week and I haven't been sleeping well. I've had a shitty appetite and I'm starting to hate everything about myself. It was suggested to me by my HR that I take some time off to try to clear my head. Tomorrow is my first day back in two weeks. Things haven't gotten better and I'm always alone at work. I'm scared to go back. I don't want to. We have a point system there and if you get to 10 you're fired. Work was a trigger for me so I've collected either 8, 9 or 10 in the last 2 months or so. I forgot how many I had so I could be getting fired when I come in tomorrow. I need money and I've applied to new jobs already just in case, but I know if I get fired it will be the most bittersweet thing in my life right now. I would've gotten rid of a large stressor in my life, but I would not have enough money. I'm 20, live with two roommates and go to school. My family is poor and I know they would struggle to support me if I didn't have a job. I have my own bills to pay and I'm really going to be screwed for a bit. All of my friends with the exception of 4 are away for school now and ude to school I won't have much time to see them. I'm scared things are going to get worse and my feelings will only escalate into something that could be troubling. I was recently rejected by this girl that I've still been friends with and tonight a friend went to a fair with her. When I asked that friend what he was doing earlier in the day (I wanted to hang out) he said he just wanted to stay at home tonight. I found out because the girl I like told me that they were going to the fair. That made me feel really shitty. My Mom's birthday was a couple of days ago and I forgot to at least call her. I felt like I was worthless for forgetting. It was 6pm and she texted me and she had to tell me it was her birthday. I really didn't want to live anymore after that text. I'm scared I'm becoming a huge failure and disappointment to myself. I want something bad to happen to me so I die. I know I wouldn't be able to take my own life from myself, but I don't think I would hesitate to try to save myself from anything bad happening to me. I don't see the point in living if I'm just going to feel shitty and scared all the time. I'm becoming extremely irritable, I find myself being quick to judge and then hate other people. I'm becoming an extremely bitter and pessimistic person. I'm seeing a therapist once a week now. I need that to help me. I need a lot right now. 

TL;DR My life feels like a waste, I think I'm becoming a fuck up and I'm scared of my future.  




 As a united fan it cracks me up that both picks are tough ones, but for totally opposite reasons.  




 Hey I sent you a pm. Hope it helps.  




 Thank you 




 No, I just have no idea where to start. 




 So I actually got sent home from my job yesterday because I just felt myself on the verge of breaking down while there and I just couldn't work and I nearly broke down speaking to my manager. The last month and a half or so at work my performance has dropped rapidly without me realizing it and at the same time I've been feeling worse and worse about myself while working. I loved this job and now I just can't focus on doing it. My family has a history of behavioral health problems and that causes my anxiety to increase just by thinking about it. It also doesn't help that this amazing girl I had been talking to suddenly isn't interested even after she basically said she was. 

So today I got up feeling alright about myself and I just go brush my teeth and I just start crying my eyes out. I had been feeling really crappy about myself the last month or so except when I'm around others and I think this rejection was the tipping point. I always think about suicide even when I'm not feeling down on myself, but the past month and half I've thought about it more and more and the last two days it's been all over my mind. I'm usually able to shake off these feelings of despair, but I really don't see any hope in the future and I'm not sure if I want to.  




 Writing is awesome. It's impressive to be good at writing 




 What makes you brilliant? 




 Is that James Franco? 




 It's really tough sometimes though  




 ELI5 




 So this girl I've had a crush on for a whole now recently broke up with her boyfriend about two weeks ago. I've hung out with her a few times since and I'm really getting interested in her. I'm 20 and I'm really awkward when it comes to these situations so I'm not sure how to handle it. I definitely want her to know I'm interested and I've tried to by giving her compliments (not too many), but I really don't want to come on too strong since I've heard her say to her friends she doesn't want to rush into a relationship. I know she doesn't think I'm bad looking and at least as good looking as her ex and we get along great. Ask any questions you all need, I'm appreciative of any help I can get.  














 Lol thanks 




 I sleep nude and I sleep walk 




 Alright I think I can do this. Thanks. 




 Yeah I try to avoid compliments until later on anyways. 




 I stole 3 snicker bars while I was a cashier at my first job. Never caught - I'm a good thief.  




 Brilliant idea! It has slowed down, but it's still happening. I'll give it a week. Thank you! 




 Weird prank  




 And I'm a straight guy. I typically message them back most of the time and try to tell them I'm straight and not interested in the most polite way possible. 

I wouldn't say I'm mad this is going on, it's just a little weird. I've been on OKC for over a year and never had a gay guy visit and in the past week I've had 11 guys like me and 5 message me. My profile still says I'm straight.


Anyone having this same thing happen?  




 I'm really bad at flirting. For me it's normal conversation or making fun of someone slightly.  




 I overthink messages. 




 I was thinking I'm too conservative in my messages. I'm not sure I know how to be flirty!  




 Yeah sounds about right. 




 I go full out on here. I do judge looks first, but then I go deep into the profile and their questions. Yeah, I guess it's not bad to know I'm not ugly... I guess.  




 I ask them about things in their profile and stuff like that. Maybe I just suck at communicating.
