 Right now Super Hot is getting some buzz. In Super Hot, time moves only when you move. It's pretty interesting. Right now it's only a demo, but still really good and really fun.

Also, there is Receiver. Receiver is an ultra realistic shooter. In the game, you have to operate your gun like you would a real one. Taking it off safety, counting bullets, putting bullets in magazines, cocking it, etc. It makes for some really tense gameplay. Every time you spawn you are given a random gun with a random amount of bullets. 




 It's not my favorite game but one of my favorites.

I always thought Bradley Cooper would be a great Nathan Drake from Uncharted. 




 Boy Meets World.

That or any Disney movie. Especially Disney channel original movies. 




 This is actually the case for most movies! 




 Me. 




 I don't have an under the bed. That's just another place for spiders to go. 




 Fuck.

It doesn't really make sense. In fact, a lot of the time "fuck" and its derivatives are frequently used purely to bridge thoughts and sentences. 

There are plenty of words we could say in it's place, but it *is* useful to express certain emotions. It's the same with any swear word really. They don't make a lot of sense, there are plenty of words that could be said in their place, but they do a good job of expressing certain emotions. 




 Saw Nine Inch Nails. Absolutely fantastic concert. It had the best lighting I've ever seen at a concert and amazing stage design. 




 Nine Inch Nail's album The Fragile. Incredible, interesting music.

Also, apparently Rage Against the Machine's self titled album is recorded with highest standards and is used to test audio equipment. 




 In person? I saw a dead cat. But the way I saw it was like something out of a movie.

I was asked to take care of my neighbor's cat while she was gone for Christmas. One day I went over and saw Mulligan, that's the cat's name, sitting in the bedroom with foamy drool hanging from his mouth and he was making weird noises. I took him to the vet and the vet said it's probably just stress and to not worry about it. "It might go away when the owner gets back."

So a few days later I walk over to my neighbors house to feed him and check up on him. I opened the door and the whole house is silent except for the Beethoven-esque music playing on the radio(we turned the radio on to keep Mulligan company). So this beautiful orchestra music is playing and I look down the hall and all I see is his tail sticking out. I called his name and he didn't respond.

I walked down the hall and there was Mulligan, dead. He was laying next to his toy, too. I checked to see if he was breathing and maybe just passed out. He was stiff as a plank of wood. He was gone at least 12 hours.

The whole thing was very eerie and morbid with the quiet calm house and this beautiful orchestra music echoing through the house. Sad day. Apparently he had a stroke.

I also hit a golden retriever once with my car when I was in high school. That was a tough day. 




 Look, I'm not saying that until we have evidence to disprove it, it's true. I'm saying that until we have evidence to disprove it we shouldn't rule it out.

Something may be ridiculous and unlikely, but that's not enough reason to say it's impossible. Not without evidence. Like I said, the lack of evidence that something *does* exist is not the same thing as having evidence that it *doesn't* exist. 

But you're right. It is a two way street. The lack of evidence that something *doesn't* exist is not the same thing as having evidence that it *does* exist. 

*That's* what I'm saying. No matter how ridiculous something is, without evidence to prove or disprove it, we can't rule it out.

I'm about to throw down another bad analogy. How do we know the sky is blue? Well, through science we know, but let's try another way for the sake of this analogy. A way to know would be to survey thousands of people. If you asked 10,000 people what color the sky is, it's safe to say all 10,000 will say "blue". So it's safe to say that the sky is in fact blue. I mean, how can that many people be wrong, right? Again, bad analogy, but it's the best way I can describe it.

It's kinda the same thing with the Bible. It's full of first hand accounts and testimonies of various people who have come in contact with God and/or Jesus and witnessed their, for lack of a better word, "powers". There *are* witnesses who saw Jesus heal the sick and afflicted. Now *how* he did this and the veracity of it is up to interpretation. But there *are* records of not only Jesus healing people, but also being resurrected. Around a hundred people *witnessed* Jesus being crucified and killed. And a few days later they saw him. Alive. Free of any scars except for the nail holes. Now again, *how* he did this and the veracity of it is up to interpretation, but there is a record of it happening. How could all of these people in the Bible be wrong and crazy? I don't know. But for right now, we have to kinda consider that maybe the Bible is accurate. Even if it is crazy.

 




 But like I said, my Bigfoot analogy was really dumb. It wasn't meant to be taken literally, it was meant to just put in perspective the whole thing. 

And also like I said, if you believe the Bible to be true, then there *is* proof. It's all written there. That's why I used Bigfoot as an analogy. Because the only proof we have are first hand accounts people have. Just like the Bible is firsthand accounts of people's interactions with God and Jesus. But again, this all goes back to faith. It's up to you, and only you to decide whether to believe it or not. And if you don't want to believe, fine, that's okay. That's your choice. 

But you should never rule anything out. We as a human race don't know everything. We are incredibly smart and have made massive advancements, but we still have so much to learn. 

I've said this in another thread but I'll say it here. The lack of evidence that something *does* exist is not the same thing as having evidence that it *doesn't* exist. Until we have evidence to disprove something, we should never rule it out. *That's* science.  




 I can't answer that because I just simply don't know. It's not about anyone being more special than others. It just happened that way. 

However people still had to have faith. There were numerous people who didn't believe. Jesus was crucified because they didn't believe he was the son of God.  




 Do you watch any of your own shows? Like do watch every new episode of Archer or Bob's Burgers when they first air? Like as a fan? Or do you not because hearing your own voice creates some sort of weird disconnect? 




 Then like I also said, if you're the kind of person who needs proof of everything, then there's really nothing anyone can do to convince you. 

No one has any physical evidence of God. Yet you ask for it knowing no one has it. Which leads me to believe that you simply don't want to believe.

So let me ask you: Do you want to believe? Because if the answer is "no" then there is no point in you asking people for evidence. Because there is nothing anyone can say or do to convince you. And maybe you simply don't want to be convinced, and that's okay, because that's what you want. 




 That's what I'm saying, the only evidence we have of God and Jesus doing those things is written in the Bible. It's up to you to have faith that the things written in the Bible are true. Even the crazy things like the burning bush, Moses splitting the sea, Jesus raising the dead and healing the sick and afflicted. 




 Experiences make people smart. You can study about things all you want, but until you experience something or try it out, you can never really fully understand it. I can read about how to cook a certain dish, but it's not until I actually try to cook it and tweak it that I actually *know* how to make it.

Now I'm not sure how much this applies to everything, but so far I've found it to ring true.  




 I don't know if this sheds any light on anything or helps at all, but that is kind of what religion is about. Religion is all about faith. If God came down in the flesh right now in front of everyone and showed us some Godlike powers and we all believed that this was the actual God, then it would eliminate the need for faith. We'd have proof that he exists. Full, undeniable proof.

Depending on what faith you choose to believe, if any, the reason we are here is to receive a body. A physical body. We wanted a body to be more like God and Jesus because they have physical bodies. Before the Earth was created, we were all in heaven. We were presented with two plans. One was by Satan in which we would be forced to do things on Earth against our will. The other plan, presented by Jesus, was we had free agency on Earth. There was a war in Heaven and those who sided with Satan were cast out of Heaven with him. But those who did side with Satan have a chance at redemption, which is a different discussion.

Anyway, those who sided with God and Jesus came to Earth. Here on Earth we not only received a physical body, but free will as well. This brings in the other reason why we are here: To be tested. To have our love for God tested. To have our faith tested. Now that we have free will, do we choose the way of God or Satan? Do we even believe in a God? This is basically our love and faith being tested.

If we have undeniable proof of God, then we don't have faith, we have science. And if we have science, proof of something, then there is no reason to have faith in it because we know beyond a reasonable doubt that it's true. This is a really dumb example, but God and heaven and all that stuff is sort of like Bigfoot. We don't have undeniable proof of his existence, but we have first hand accounts and testimonies of those who claim to have interacted with him. Those who choose to believe in Bigfoot are going on faith. The Bible, should you choose to believe it, is kind of like first hand accounts and records of people who have come in contact with religious experiences and Jesus and what not. 

This all goes back to the core component of religion. Faith. It sounds unreliable, and if you're the kind of person who needs proof of everything then there's really nothing anyone can do to convince you. You just have to have faith.

I hope I helped, even if it is just a little bit.  




 Wait I don't remember that, when did this happen? 




 Yes this is it! Thanks! 




 In this horror movie, which takes place in a jungle type location(maybe Australia?), a group of friends go camping I guess? They swim in a lake and I think one of them gets leeches. The leeches make her sick and turn her into like a homicidal maniac? One scene that sticks out is when the friends attempt to trap their turned friend by dropping a net on her. 

I don't remember thinking it was a great movie but I enjoyed it and would like to watch it again, but I have no idea what it was called. Help? 




 Someone asked what the creepiest Wikipedia article they knew was. I saved the post, but it doesn't show up in my saved section. Also, when I search for it, I can't find it. Did it get deleted? Or does someone have a link to it? 




 I'm curious about what event in your life led you to have such a vendetta against Mormonism. Why can't Mormons believe what they want? Why does what they do bother you so much? 

I just fail to understand why you feel the need to ridicule an entire religion. It shouldn't matter whether you believe what they do or not, or if you think they are ignorant. You don't go around saying people's religions are based off of lies. Religion is supposed to revolve around faith, not facts. Religion is all about worshiping Gods we can't prove exist. So even if you don't believe what Mormons believe is real or true, it doesn't matter. It's real to them. 

Also, why do you care so much? Do you believe you will be the great hero to all ignorant Mormons? The one who will wake them all up and make them see the error of their ways? 




 That's, like, not even the same thing.  




 You just said "probably" wrong. Because you *think* something *might* be wrong doesn't automatically make it wrong. Not unless you have proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The lack of proof that something *does* exist is not the same thing as having proof that it *doesn't* exist.  









 ITT: Mormon Bashing 




 You're allowed to believe whatever you want to believe and whatever, but how could you possibly know that the Book of Mormon is fiction? I mean, it's kind of dickish of you to basically say that everything a religion believes is false. You may *think* that, but you can't *know* that.   




 Poor Marv. 




 Anxiety 




 I don't mind comic book movies. I'm just tired of the idea that instead of Hollywood sitting down and coming up with original films, they look for what ever comic book hasn't been made into a movie, whether it should or not. 

Like I said, I don't mind comic book movies. In fact I quite enjoy them, but it seems like lately instead of being made along side other original films, comic book movies are taking the place of original films. I know Hollywood is a business, but it sucks that Hollywood will almost always choose a super hero or comic book movie instead of taking a risk and making original movies. 




 What nights are the board game nights 














 So my friends are super busy with college and work so we rarely get to hang out, but I love going out. I hate sitting at home by myself. 

What are some places or activities where I could go by myself and still have fun and get enjoyment and not feel weird being alone? 




 They don't have to be night clubs with loud music either. They can be jazz clubs, dance clubs or whatever. I'm just looking for some great clubs or bars with great atmosphere. I don't really venture into the club scene so I have no idea what the club scene in Memphis is like. 




 How do I learn what shows are where and when? Is there like a website or something? 




 I'm new, just starting out. I honestly don't have the slightest idea how to create a podcast. How to record one, and how/where to post it. What are some good resources for someone to learn all of this? Any help is incredibly appreciated! 









 Recently our neighbor went out of town for a few weeks and asked us to watch her cat. Long story short we went to her house to check on him the other day and discovered him lying on the floor dead.

After talking to our neighbor on the phone, she asked us to bury him in her backyard. So we got a box to put him in and when we picked him up he was stiff. Like a plank of wood. His joints wouldn't even move hardly.

What causes this? I know it's suppose to happen, but what happens in the body that causes it to become stiff and hard?

 The Proposition. Really good movie. 




 Also, report back! Would love to see an after shot 




 I know David Fincher comes from a background of directing music videos but who are some other directors who have directed music videos? Either before they were famous or after they became famous, I'm just looking for music videos by film directors.  









 So lately when I'm not home and out in public away from wifi, my phone will not connect to 4g. Like there isn't even an icon at the top. It didn't use to do this. It started about a week ago. It's a pain because it keeps me from doing ANYTHING that requires internet. What is causing this and how can I fix this? Any help?

Here's a screenshot http://imgur.com/390q1uY

You see in the top left corner? No wifi signal, no 4G, 3G or anything. 




 Why do you say that? If I said something wrong can you please correct me? 




 Yes this exactly. I haven't done anything different. Just one day there was nothing. 




 You're not getting too old. Rockstar tried to make a game with rules that contradict the kind of game it is. Open world sandbox games are not supposed to be restrictive. 




 I always thought it was more about the leather and less about cats. Like, he seems like a kind of latex/leather sort of guy.

 Charlie's Angels. I love that movie so much.  




 I dunno, I'd show a 13-14 year old The Matrix but probably not Wolf of Wall Street.  




 "How much you wanna make a bet I could throw a football over them mountains?" - Napoleon Dynamite 

I love it because it's so dumb and he's completely serious when he says it. 




 And don't be broad by saying Italian or Asian. Be specific! If it's pizza, what kind of pizza? What's on it? Describe what is in or on your favorite food! If it's from a restaurant, which one? 




 /r/nocontext 




 I think this is the best answer.  




 I'm super late to the party so this probably won't be seen.

The Tree of Life. I grew up in a very religious family. A family sort of like the one in the movie. I was super close to my mother and my father was a hard worker, so he wasn't around much. He was stern, didn't say much, and had a hard time showing his love for anyone. We all knew he loved us, but had a hard time saying or showing it. I saw the movie with my mother and we both cried. It was a very beautiful film about family, life, death, faith, and what it all means. 




 Even though I'm in my 20s, I felt like I was going to get in trouble by my mom for watching this movie. 




 It's hard to believe this is the same guy. 




 I'm wasn't defending Argo or knocking Lincoln, I was just interested in why you thought that. After your explanation I can see where you're coming from. Lincoln did have pretty great performances.  




 Question, What exactly did you find great about Sam Rockwell's performance in The Way Way back? I saw it and thought, while good, it mostly felt like Sam Rockwell being Sam Rockwell. 




 Really though? I mean I thought he was great but it felt like he was just Sam Rockwell in it. I'm not saying you're wrong for thinking that, I just find it an interesting choice. 




 I'm surprised to see New World mentioned. That movie was fantastic and Hwang Jeong-min was great! 




 You could also argue that Lincoln is a type of movie that has been done a hundred times over.  




 Wow, I never heard this before. It's fantastic! 




 Any song, anywhere, as long as it was a live performance. Links welcomed! 









 All I really listen to are 101.9, 98.1, 99.7 and 107.5. But they all play the same music. What are some other radio stations with different music? 









 Tree of Life. I think it's one of the greats. It's a super mixed movie. People either love it or hate it. Mostly hate. It has a pretty low score on IMDB (or at least to me it's low). And everyone I've talked to about it says its bad.  




 See the saddest thing about Paul Walker is that he was on the cusp of pulling a Matthew McConaughey. He was totally about to become the actor he was suppose to be. Running Scared is one of my all time favorites. 
 









 I'm not trying to discredit animated films or the people who make them. But I think it's more difficult to create beautiful cinematography in a live action film because cinematographers have to work within the realm of reality. They have do deal with real world lighting and what not. Whereas animators can kind of make it up. 

Again, I'm not trying to discredit any animated films or the hard work people put into making them.  




 What scene on top of the train? 




 I think there was something to get. But you didn't get it not because you're not smart, I just think that the movie was super vague on its symbolism and metaphors. I think even the smartest people will scratch heir heads at it.  




 I still want to see him do a super hero movie. 




 I just can't find it for the life of me. Anyone else go here that knows how? 




 xXx (Triple X)? 




 I don't know how plausible this is, but it could be he simply didn't know he was plagiarizing. 

What I mean is, have you ever thought of something or tried to remember something and then you think, "I can't remember if this was from a movie or book or dream."

There's a word for it. When you think of something and you think you're creating it from scratch but subconsciously you're pulling it from you memories of, in this case, a book. 

Now I'm not saying this is what happened or even that it's likely, but it is possible.  









 For example, Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit is one of my favorites.

Also, it can be a prequel, sequel, threequel or whatever. 









 Man I would have loved to see Inception as a horror movie. I really want to see what Nolan can do with horror. And I would love to see what kind of creepy, horrific, twisted things would've happen since anything can happen in dreams. Would be very interesting. 




 I think it all depends on personal taste. I prefer TRL because it focuses on the emotional and psychological toll of war. I love SPR, and I appreciate what it was trying to say but its message was drowned out by all the action and violence surrounding it.

Edit: Wow downvoted because my opinion is different than yours. Thanks for encouraging opinions and discussion, reddit.  




 Also, the Elton John biopic coming up. 




 Yeah that was probably the biggest shocker of the award season last year. Everyone thought Lincoln would win everything.  




 Hugo was pretty and well shot. But Tree of Life was incredibly gorgeous. Easily one of the most beautiful films ever shot.  




 I would give The Tree of Life best cinematography. One of the most beautiful movies. 

Also I don't know if it got a nomination or not but Samsara should have gotten best documentary. 

And I still think its a crime Christopher Nolan didn't get a best director nomination for Inception. 

Also I'd give Into the Wild a nomination for best score, original song, cinematography, picture, and leading actor. Don't know which it would've won but it definitely deserved more nominations.  




 You say that but if I remember correctly (which I'm probably wrong) didn't Lincoln only walk away with just a few awards? 




 I *hope* it's Lupita. I love Jennifer Lawrence and think she's a great actress and I haven't seen American Hustle, but Lupita's performance was incredible.  




 Frances Ha is one of my favorites of the year. Gerwig was great in it.  




 I definitely consider it emotional. It's a song where you can feel his pain. 




 Ouch :( 




 Exactly. 




 Lately I've been trying to find music where the singer is singing with so much emotional power, it's like you can feel their pain. Their suffering. Their sadness. Almost to where it might even sound like they're crying or holding back tears.

What are some songs like this? 









 I watched [The New Guy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241760/?ref_=nv_sr_3) the other day for the first time in years and I thought it was pretty great. I wanted to know what those of you who have seen it thought about it.

I thought it had some really great physical comedy and had some great cameos by celebrities. Definitely one of my favorite high school movies. It even has a decent message about being yourself and not forgetting who you really are.

Any one here seen it? And if so what are your thoughts on it? It's not a movie that gets mentioned hardly ever. 




 It's not that. This article is basically saying, "Despite your opinion, these are the worst movies of the year and if you like them and think they are not that bad then you are wrong." At no point do they say, "Hey, this is just our opinion." They're treating their opinion like it's the correct one. 




 I like to believe everyone is going by the saying, "Out of sight, out of mind." I think everyone wants to just forget that movie happened. And the best way to forget it is to never mention it. 




 I really liked Wrong and thought it was good. 




 It's not the same song, but it definitely sounds like the same guy. His name is Johann Johannsson. 




 This looks so sick! I really really hope this doesn't turn in to another case of Man of Steel where the trailer turns out better than the movie. I'm optimistic though.  




 I'm late but I wanted to give my personal thoughts on it. There have been some great advice on here already as well as not so great. But here are my thoughts. 

I feel like if two people love each other, and I mean really love each other, they will understand if one of them wants to wait. I feel like they wouldn't throw away their relationship with you if you don't do it. 

Also I feel there are more important things I want in a relationship than sex. Now is sex important? Yes I feel it is. But I don't think you can base your decision of whether you love someone or not on sex. I want a girl that I can have deep intense conversations with and I can feel comfortable being vulnerable around them. If I find a girl like that and we love each other, and she tells me she wants to wait, I'm not going to throw it all away.  It doesn't mean she loves me less. 

But this is all just my feelings on this.  




 I love them. They bring me back to a time when I was that age. I know most people would like to forget that time but it was the best time of my life. I love being reminded of it.  




 It makes it feel like I'm looking into the human body. Cells, nerves, all that stuff. 

I know this has been theorized before, but it's so cool to think about. What if our universe *is* someones body. And what if all of our bodies are different universes for other life forms. And their bodies and so on and so forth. Infinite universes.  




  two many ears

FTFY 














 But why do you think that though? 




 You're right. I was super surprised to hear the many bad reviews of The Counselor. I mean, when you look at all the people involved in it; Ridley Scott, Cormac McCarthy, Brad Pitt, Michael Fassbender, and Javier Bardem, it's easy to assume it won't be anything other than great. 




 But based on the director and his previous works, didn't you know what you were getting yourself in to? I mean Nicolas Refn isn't exactly known for having fast paced non stop action movies. What exactly *were* you expecting when before you saw it?

 




 Doesn't that kind of make it partly your fault? When you allow yourself to have high hopes for something, you automatically take the risk of it not meeting those expectations. Am I saying you're wrong for not liking it? No, not at all. It's perfectly okay to not like it. 

I am curious though to know your thoughts on it. 




 I agree. I think people are over exaggerating how terrible these movies are. I mean, they're pretty well made movies. Are they great? Not really, but I've seen WAY worse movies. In fact, I actually kind of dug the super dark comedy/crime tone of Hangover 3.  




 I was the same way. OGF is one of my favorites of the year. While I realize it's not perfect, I didn't think it was terrible. People tend to think that "slow" and "violent" and "little dialogue" automatically means bad. I understand that many people may not be into that, but that doesn't make something terrible. 




 I don't think this is the kind of movie you see based off of what people say. It's a very subjective kind of movie. You should see it on your own merits. If it is something you might be interested in then give it a watch. 




 You need to get your expectations straight before you see OGF. It's not Drive. Visually it's similar, but Drive is a lot more straight forward and easier to watch. If you go into OGF with the expectations that it's like Drive you won't enjoy it as much. It is incredibly slow. It takes its time. More so than Drive. It is more like Refn's Valhalla Rising. I'd say that if you like Drive than there is a good chance you'll like OGF, just don't expect it to be another Drive. If you don't mind movies that take their time and are really slow, then give it a watch. 




 Exactly. I feel like any movie can be terrible if you had the wrong expectations for it.  




 I know she doesn't resemble the physique of Wonder Woman, but I would've loved to have seen Olga Kurylenko as Wonder Woman. 









 "How much you wanna bet I could throw a football over them mountains?" 




 Of course it's private. 









 This is very helpful! Thank you! 




 I was watching Jumper, and it reminded me of the sweet marketing it had before its release. Before there was even a trailer, Jumper had this really cryptic website that, if I remember correctly, was set up like a conspiracy bulletin board with weird photos and notes on it. Finding out what the movie was, was sort of like solving a mystery. The same with Cloverfield. Strange teaser. Cryptic website.

What movies do you think have had great, clever, or interesting marketing? Billboards, websites, teasers, promotions, or anything else that falls under marketing. 









 MLA format.

I'm wondering about how to do a citation for a movie? I've never cited a movie before. I'm wondering if I need to cite a specific quote from a movie, or just reference the movie then cite it. Can I just reference a film and that count as a proper citation? Or if it's a quote from a person do i have to cite the person who said it in the movie as well as the movie itself? 









 Specifically citations? I posted in /r/HomeworkHelp, but that community isn't super active with there hardly ever being more than a dozen people there at a time. HomeworkHelp is great, but I need to find somewhere to ask a citation question where I can get some feedback quickly. Any subreddits like this? I have to finish this paper and all I need to do is work in this one source I'm having trouble with. Help? 




 My essay is basically done. All I need to do is work in a citation somewhere.

My question is about how to use a citation. Can I just reference something and that be considered a citation? Or does it have to be a direct quote? 

For example, my teacher is telling us that one of our citations has to be from this documentary we watched about The Black Power sign showcased at the 1968 Olympics. So I didn't really know how to use a movie as a source.

How exactly do I use a movie as a source? Can I put in a quote from someone that they said within the film and consider that a proper citation of the movie? Like for instance if someone said, "The stunt they pulled at the Olympics in 1968 is what propelled the Black Power Movement forward." If I put that quote in my essay, is that a proper way to use a movie as a source?

I really need help figuring out how to use this movie as a source. It's literally all I have left to do in my essay, and I cannot figure how how to do it properly. I've never used a movie as a source. Help? 




 Dat drum intro/outro 




 It doesn't have to be something exactly $50,000, but just think of it as that's how much you have at your disposal to spend on someone. 

Edit: Screw it! I can't change the title so I'll put in this edit. I'm raising the limit to $500,000. I want to see what you guys come up with. I want o see how much good you can do. And so you don't have to rack your brain trying to figure out how to spend every penny of it, let's say you can do whatever you want with whatever is left over. Blow it, put it in the bank or whatever. But I don't want to hear what you'll do with what's left, I want to hear how you'll use that money for good. 









 The Matrix. Saw it for the first time when I was a kid. It blew my mind. It was the movie that made me realize that movies can be more than just entertainment. I realized they could be art. If it wasn't for the Matrix, I wouldn't have seen all the movies I have seen now. The Matrix is also what got me into film making. Film is my passion. I love watching them and making them, and I owe it all to The Matrix. 




 You look like a tv star! 




 Don't know if you have one, but I'd love to see a current pic? If that's okay 




 I think there's more than that involved when it comes to Oscar bait. When I think of Oscar bait I think: period piece, usually biopic, has an ensemble cast, they alter their appearance somehow, and is usually directed by an Oscar nominated director. 

Things like The Kings Speech, The Artist, Lincoln, and even though it isn't out yet, American Hustle is looking that way. Now does Oscar bait mean "bad"? I don't think so. All those movies I listed are great. And even American Hustle looks good.  




 I'm the same way. I find myself playing devil's advocate a lot when talking about people with a group of friends. I don't like talking about someone behind their back. It feels...weird. It feels like I'm betraying them. I just can't do that. And if I do start to talk about someone, I feel bad midway through my sentence and back out before any damage is done. I guess it's because my parents always told me to "treat everyone like they are having a harder time than you." I don't know what kind of life this person has when I'm not around. I don't know what problems this person might be dealing with. And insulting them, whether it be to their face or behind their back, doesn't solve anything. 




 I don't know, man. They were either Oscar bait or had heavy handed messages about the environment, racism, or religion. 




 If that's the criteria we're going with for what makes something terrible, then I guess there are a lot of highly praised Oscar movies that are terrible. Wall-e's terrible, Americn History X is terrible. As well as American Beauty, Django Unchained, Gravity, 12 Years a Slave, The King's Speech, The Artist. I mean really, with the criteria you set up for what makes a movie terrible, this list can get pretty long. 




 But why though? I'm genuinely curious, not trying to start something. 




 Whenever 2004s Crash is brought up, almost everyone says it was terrible and "utter shit". I mean, it's not the best movie, and it shouldn't have won Best Picture that year, but I feel like I'm one of the few that not only like Crash, but think it's pretty good. Yeah it seems heavy handed with its message and it might have been Oscar-baity, but the acting seemed really solid. And the cinematography was pretty good as well as the directing. I mean all in all I think it's a decent movie at worst.

I just fail to understand why most people will say it's absolutely terrible and again, "utter shit". Could someone civilly explain to me why people think this, or if you think it then why?  I'm genuinely curious.  




 Yeah I love Saving Private Ryan, but I think The Thin Red Line is the better WWII movie. 




 Dude, was it oscar baity? Yes. Was it the best movie of that year? Not at all. But Crash is in no way a bad movie. 




 Everyone has their own opinion and to each his own, but I think "terrible" is a little strong. This was not a bad movie. It may have not even been good, but I thought it was decent and solid. What makes you say it's terrible? 




 Me? I mean when you look at who's involved it seems reasonable to assume it would be great.  




 I loved the original, but maybe I'm not as much as a hardcore fan because all in all I thought it was a solid remake. And I use "solid" loosely. It wasn't bad. In fact, it's pretty decent. I think as a movie it's pretty good, but as a remake it could have used some work. Maybe this will be a Daredevil scenario where the directors cut will greatly improve it. 




 When I said it felt rushed, I didn't mean just the ending felt rushed, I meant the whole movie felt rushed. 




 Eh, I don't know. I guess I could buy that considering it's a different country with a different character. And without spoiling anything, they do kind of hint at something that could definitely make that a possibility. 




 I watched Frances Ha and I really loved how it captured the mood, tone, vibe, and what life living in New York City is like. What are some other movies that really capture what life in a big city is like? Where it's almost like the city itself is a character? Whether it be NYC, Detroit, LA, Hong Kong, Tokyo, or whatever. 




 As someone who has seen the original I thought it was actually pretty good. It's not bad at all. Josh Brolin is great in it. It's shot well. It's definitely a good remake, but like I said, it did feel rushed. But all in all it was pretty good. However, I think if you have the opportunity to see the original, you have to watch it. Spike Lee's is good, but Chan Wook Park's is a masterpiece. But if you can't watch the original, then Spike Lee's is a good option. It stays pretty close to the original. 




 That's funny cause I just saw it and I thought it felt rushed.
