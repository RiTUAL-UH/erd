 No worries, I could read it just fine. :) I think you are really on point with me not being specific about what "healthy" means. You gave me a lot to think about. Several of you have mentioned MFP and you are right. I'm going to track from now on. Great tips in your post! I'm going to start checking this sub everyday and try to be active.  




 This is exactly how I feel. If I make just one mistake it's just another proof of how this will never work and that I should just give up. I'm making myself a victim instead of just accepting it and keep on going. I'm going to think of this post next time it happens. Thank you and good luck to you too!  




 Thank you. Thing is, I already have a food scale. I have counted calories countless time, with and without myfitnesspal. I know how much/few calories I need to consume and what kinds of food I need to eat (and not eat). The problem is time. I usually last for a couple of weeks before falling back to my regular (bad) habits. 

I started counting with myfitnesspal again a couple of weeks ago and then I had a few bad days. Didn't like seeing my mistakes logged so I just stopped logging. And a few bad days turned into several. I have been on a C25K program the last month but now I'm sick and I'm afraid that I won't continue with the program when I get better. I have a history with going in strong and when it gets tough or I make a mistake I just quit. It's easier than to keep trying. 

I'm not interested in quick fixes or fast weight loss. I just want a better lifestyle for myself. 

My strategy? Eat less, eat better, move more. Eat less = around 1400 cal should be enough, eat better = fill up on more veggies, lean protein and some fat, move more = get of the couch for walks and keep on jogging. I want to add some bodyweight training too. 
Issues? I have a whole bunch of them. ;) Mostly making excuses for myself. I tried writing down some issues but they are all bad excuses.
My goal is to be at a healthy weight, preferably around 65 kg (143 lbs), exercise regularly and feel strong and happy.   




 Both in life and on this subreddit. I'm F/172 cm (5'7)/79 kg (175). I have struggled with my weight, my selfesteem and depression all my life. I now have two little girls and I don't want to do this any more. My mother have been on a diet her entire life and still is. I want to show my girls what it's like to love yourself and take care of your body. To do that I need to do it for myself first. 

But this is where anxiety kicks in. I have failed all my previous attempts. Now I am at my heaviest (except during pregnancies). In a couple of months I will be 30 years old. I'm entering my thirties weak, fat and scared. How is this time any different? Will this just end in another failure? I'm already preparing myself for my next failure and I don't think that is going to help me. 

I have decided to stop being a lurker and start being active. Maybe this community is what I need to stop being afraid of life. Maybe this is the thing that will finally put an end to the anxiety and pain. Maybe this will help make it fun.   

I would really appreciate stories from those of you who have been where I am and who managed to turn their life around. Or maybe just tell me something that helped you making that change. Thank you for reading and if you're a part of this community then you're already a great inspiration!   


Edit: Thank you! I'm overwhelmed by all the supporting and inspiring replies. I woke up today feeling like this will actually work! I'm going to start logging my food in MFP. My username is Anthliel of you want to add me. I log most of my food in swedish but I'm going to try to log in english when possible.  




 Great post! I really needed to read this today.
