 I absolutely agree, and I definitely will be out and about during this trip. However, I'm a very techy person so anything with lights and sounds amuses me extremely while tripping aha 




 YouTube vids, music videos, games, movies, short stories, etc.

I like mind fucks and deep stories and all that stuff, but I'm open to anything. Especially serious/dark stuff! 




 This also tripped me out, especially the mirrors! 




 Totally normal. You may find that anything you drink or eat will be masked with the taste while tripping, also. 




 I don't think it's that simple.

There will always be slang. There's slang for marijuana and look how close to legalization that is. Whether you think it's wrong or not, I'll call it whatever the hell I want. Lucy is a slang term and its used right in the fuckin' sidebar. Preach to someone who gives a shit, lad. 




 When I start talking to politicians and scientists, I'll get a little more serious. Right now I'm only on the internet. Nobody important gives a shit about this subreddit or it's LSD activists. 




 Absolutely love it. Didn't think there'd be too many people here who knew of the band 




 It was my desktop background and phone background for ages! Love it so much 




 Hell yeah! Haha For anyone who's curious;

The band is Barrier. The album is called "Eventide". It's a trippy, Metalcore, concept album. Cool stuff. 









 It's shitty. I went to take a walk for like two hours just because it was killing me and now I'm back in my room. I just can't fall asleep, I just want to fast forward to when we can try again. I'm so upset with myself. 




 My group of friends has a couple virgins and we're all pretty normal young adults. You just need the right friends, mature friends 




 Okay, but I'm going to watch it sober first haha I've seen Devil's Rejects but have slacked on this movie! 




 Yeah, it could turn out to be silly. That whole "I see the man behind the curtain" effect hits me a lot while tripping 




 Cartoons while tripping are always interesting, I might try this. What's it about? 




 See, I love horror, but I love letting myself become absorbed the the world the movie is showing me. So I basically let myself believe what's happening on the screen to enjoy it more. This is what I'd be worried about while tripping 




 It's funny because this is pretty much me during playtime with these characters. I feel like there wasn't enough testing in this side of the game, I don't know. Just my opinion. It's somewhat difficult to control them fluently. I mean, I can lure enemies fine and pussy-foot through a scene but I want it to look cool! It's not easy to look cool with these guys unless by luck. But maybe that's just me. 




 I remember waking up and the first thing I read from PC Gamer was "GTA V on PC delayed again..."

A heavy and emotional sigh ensued.
