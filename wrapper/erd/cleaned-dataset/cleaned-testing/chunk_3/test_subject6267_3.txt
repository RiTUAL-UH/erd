 Seriously the best food when going for a day out, especially for things like hiking or travelling (not flying obvs) 




 I just find it easier to massage around with one hand towards my fingertips, as I'm usually using my computer with my more dominant hand haha. I suppose I could just pump it onto my left hand but I really lack control.

Will the balm work well as part of OCM? I really enjoy the steaming part 




 I thought making us remove our water bottle labels was going too far. 




 This shoot deserves to be in Vogue. 




 Seconding this; bar street can be fun but its become pretty pricey (so is all of Sanlitun to be fair) and a bit repetitive. The clubs and bars around Gongti Ximen are definitely the place to go for meeting expats. 

If you're thinking of drinking something different or are into beers, Heaven supermarket is a nice place to head to, its not very expensive and has a variety of drinks in a supermarket style but with a seating area to meet people. Personally, I prefer going there over the clubs.

If you're looking to meet foreign students (inc. girls) in Beijing, head on over to Wudaokou, its good fun, local pubs have things like Quiz nights going on too.

I do really recommend going to some night markets, the Wangfujing Snack Street at night is pretty good for tourists but be sure to haggle. Also, eat lots of street food (if your stomach can handle it), jianbing is definitely one to pick up. 




 I'm currently using TFS's Rice Water Bright cleansing oil as the first step in my evening routine but i find it to be too 'slippery', its a little too runny and I have to tilt my face back a little to make sure it doesn't run down into my eyes (I pumped it straight onto my face and begin massaging.... I know, its odd but I really need to maximise my study time). I do love the smell of this one though 3

Could anyone recommend a different oil with a bit more grip? I have blocked pores on my forehead and normal/combo skin. I also don't wear very much makeup but use the Biore UV gel sunscreen. 




 I really like the palette, maybe I'll get one after finishing up mu current finishing powder. I'm looking to buy my first cushion compact, will definitely keep the AmorePacific in mind!! 




 So jealous of your glow right now!! By the way, is it the Ambient Lighting palette your using? I'm thinking of getting one as people say that it gives you this radiance, but its sooooo pricey. 




 I actually got a sample of the Fresh Cherry tint in my Jolse delivery the other day! I'll definitely give it a go. Can you apply lip balm on top of it? 




 I have used the Mario Badescu drying lotion which is basically calamine solution at the bottom with alcohol at the top. I used to apply this, let it dry then wash off and repeat and this has created such bad scarring, as the alcohol completely dried my skin out leaving me with a thin scab. Once the scab came off, the skin underneath was very pale pink, a sign of tissue damage.

I received the Mizon Acence Blemish Out Pink Spot the other day and and it seems to be pretty much the same but it has castor oil as to not dry the skin out as much. I would recommend this over any other spot treatments.

However, if you need a transparent one, the Origins Spot Zapper works well too. 




 I'm pretty sure the BHA A-sol is meant to be spot treatment but most people use it as a toner, seeing as the BHA content is not strong enough to just use as a BHA.

If you use a higher pH cleanser, something like 6, maybe the AHA/BHA toner would be better as it would bring the pH right down to balance the skin? 




 I'm looking for a lip tint/stain, preferably something similar in texture to YSL's Glossy Stain and having the longevity of Sephora's Cream Lip Stain but I don't mid if its more matte. The only thing is, my lips dry out quite easily so I'm worried watery tints will seep into the dry spots.

If you guys could recommend any lip products, especially any red ones, that last long (through eating etc.) I'd really appreciate it! 




 I have double eyelids but they're uneven, one sort of folds at a different angle, so for the past 2 years I have been wearing eyelid tape during the night (so that when my face swells in the morning, it helps to take shape) and the days when I'm at home all day (weekends and the days I finish school early). This has been a very long process and I have seen some improvement, but I expect it will still need longer.

My cousin, who has monolids, has managed to create a permanent double fold over the years, by using tape to 'teach' her lids to fold that way. However, she still often goes out with the tape on, although so do many other girls in China.

Eyelid tape does and probably will do some damage to the elasticity of the skin, so remember to be gentle and try to reduce any tugging etc.

My dad also has blepharitis, and he finds that using salt water for a hot compress really helps when his eyes get itchy and red. 




 They're fake but they do the job, my mum went there when she misplaced her reading glasses and she got a pair of 'Cartier' glasses within 2 hours using her glasses as a reference for a script. She did say they ended up being a lot stronger though... 




 Hey! Welcome to the world of AB!! I'm pretty new to it myself but its been a really good learning process so far.

What's your skin type like? From what's in your cart, I'm assuming you have some PIH and maybe acne?

If it's those, I think your products will do a good job, I pretty much bought the same but I have the CosRX BHA returning A-Sol to use as a toner after cleansing as I've read that the AHA/BHA toner from CosRX has a really low pH of 3.85, which [u/SnowWhiteandthePear](http://www.reddit.com/user/SnowWhiteandthePear) blogged about [here](http://snowwhiteandthepear.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/review-cosrx-aha-bha-clarifying.html).

Make sure to introduce the BHA and AHA's into your routine slowly, e.g. starting with just once a week, then slowing increasing or decreasing depending on how your skin responds. An overhaul of acids can often lead to purging.

To tackle blackheads and acne, I would start with BHA and the Vit C first (do remember the OST is an L-AA, so your order should be Vit C, wait 20 mins, BHA, wait, then AHA if using all three). The snail is also great as a light moisturiser, use it according to the light to heavy theory of viscocity.

I like to use the Mizon Snail Recovery Gel as a final moisturiser as I like the texture it leaves on my skin, its not too suffocating before going to sleep. 














 Yeah, the BHA sample is from them, I'm not quite sure when I'll be able to use it though.. it seems like such a small amount.

I tried everything last night except the AHA, but I'm going to put them through more use to get a better feel though. I found the CosRX Snail Mucin so weird though, I put one pump onto my palm and used my fingers to spread out on my face and it just had the biggest trail. The texture is a little odd at first but it did moisturise quite nicely overnight. 




 The waiting is the hardest part! The first 2 days I was obsessively tracking where the orders were but eventually I just gave up cause after I saw it had arrived in Europe, there weren't any other updates.

Excited for you to get your products though!! 




 You know, I honestly didn't feel too different after using this, probably because I usually oil cleanse with grapeseed oil and coconut oil (although I've stopped using this for facial cleansing now). I found the Rice Cleanser hard to lather up too, even though I used like 3 pumps, did you have any problems with emulsifying? 




 I'm a little hesitant due to the things I've heard about purging, I know you're meant to take it slow (giggledegoo) but I just want to rush in and see what clean pores look like! 




 Everything haha! I'm really excited/nervous to give the process chemical exfoliation a proper go, I've used Mario Badescu's Glycolic Acid toner before but it didn't do anything for me in terms of lifting my PIH, although it did give me a slight glow. 

I've never used BHA's before so I'm hoping it'll do a good job cleaning out my pores, particularly on my forehead where I normally get breakouts.
