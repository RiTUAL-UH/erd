 We didn't domestic dogs. They domesticated us. Read about the co-evolution of our fury friends and man.  




 Need to bring this festival to the United States. Good picture.
 



















 This new life came from the seeds and nutrients of the bird poop. 




 I had a near death experience from a mugging and experienced the same feeling.  




 Most likely but I would be cool if you didn't.  




 Good question.  




 Maybe we are all  one hologram of a "parent" universes black hole.  









 The buildings almost caught on fire. 




 I like it. 









 Did not know that. Going to have to check it out. Thank you. 









 Ok. Going to buy a big bag of lemons today. My side is hurting a little.  




 With or without sugar? 




 Thanks for input. I am going to try to cut down my coffee to a couple of cups a day and drink more water. This is not going to be easy but I hope this help because kidney stones are aweful. 




 T-mobile doesn't have hidden charges like verizon.  




 The United States is not a democracy but a constitutional republic. 





























 Should have won. 



















 No problem. Have a good one. 




 The point is not the smoking but rather his own freewill and humor in the face of authority. In this aspect, he was ahead of his time.  




 He is currently died but his words live on. RIP. 




 I am not advocating smoking. Just like adults with independent minds and  speech styles. He was a little too much off a left brain analyst for my taste but  I enjoy his
attitude toward irrational authority.  




 Not really into fiction. My short term memory is too poor to keep track of all the characters. Good at visualizing and understanding abstract concepts and macro theory.  




 He has a wild trance like cadence to his voice.  




 My dogs are littermates so they are real protective of each other and me at the dog park. Crazy little guys. They have the small dog napoleon complex. 




 Thought people would get a kick out of this old short video clip. 




 Like dogs better than most people. 




 Watch Terence McKenna's youtube videos. Don't take most of what he says literally but rather as philosophical abstraction.  




 Not the book but understand some of the story from philosophy websites. 









 Ever heard of the concept of reality tunnel. 




 They are my kids.  




 The mystery of life. I am not 100% sure of anything.A couple of years ago, I  had a near death experience from a mugging. The feeling was beyond words. It was like I was one with the universe.  




 Our universe could be one of many. There is a strange new theory that our universe is in the center of a black hole. In this theory, the big bang was the moment of formation of this black hole. If this theory is true, that means we live inside a black hole of a "parent" universe. I don't know if this is fact but it would not go against the known mechanics of quantum physics. 




 Awesome video. 














 Should have titled video: Caitlin/Bruce in 1980's McDonald's commercial. 




 And when your a kid.
