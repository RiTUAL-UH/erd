 The higher level ones always say "the remainder of the solution is trivial" and give you no clue as to what to do next. 




 That is not the same leprosy, the medical disease, of today. Does leprosy get on a house? 




 That sounds like a line from a math textbook. 




 It is widely agrees that the root is the verb "to be." The only difference whether it is causative or not. The different translations given are just poetic. 




 No, I am a **stick!** 




 Don't embarrass yourself by trying to tell Hebrew speakers what Hebrew means. The different translation depend on the verb inflection, not the etymology. 




 If it is idolatry it would be forbidden according to the Noahide laws.

And this becomes a Jewish legal discussion of what exactly idolatry is and how it is different for Jews and non-Jews.

And if I don't like it? Would I have to move or just accept it?

Accept, try to reform it, or move.

 




 The same reason that as an American (or a citizen of any country), you have rights and responsibilities that others, immigrants or tourists, do not have. If David's mother is American and he is born in another country, he gets citizenship as soon as he visits the nearest consulate. You are Jewish the same way, it's just more automatic and cannot be revoked.   




 Everyone has to go through a period of atonement/spiritual cleansing. Non-practicing Jews just might have a little bit more to go through. 




  What is the purpose of saying he must technically keep the commandment if his actual obligation is waved?

How it is treated in Jewish law. Suffice to say that until he learns about it, it doesn't matter.

Humans are humans and if you WANT to be in this covenant, that's one thing. But, from my POV, it's completely unfair and unjust that my friend Daniel is given expectations because of his blood.

His blood and mine are NOT significantly different. Of course there is a difference, but the difference is not significant. Making it significant is a fabrication. A method of keeping clan-unity in the ancient world. We should, as species, move past this obsession with blood-line. It's unhealthy. It's unfair. It's unreasonable.

This is ancestry, not "blood." The blood is pretty much the same all around. 

It comes down to a different system of values. Post-Enlightenment western values places a lot of emphasis on individuality, while traditional Judaism has more of a balance between community responsibility and individual desires. As an atheist, I assume you support the idea of moral relativism, of which this is a manifestation. 




 All I'm saying is it's ignorant to think that we can say with absolute certainty that the Big Bang is fact, same with evolution. 

the exact mechanism of the big bang is still being researched, but the fact that the universe is almost 14 billion years old is proven by several different methods. 




  I'll assume you're going about the halakhic definition of Jew, Jewish mother or Orthodox Jewish convert. If you're using another definition please let me know :)

That is the Orthodox definition, yes.

Why would I follow this rule if I believe that not worshiping an idol would be bad for me? Also wouldn't Trinitarian and Latter Day Saint Christianity count as idolatry?

It is forbidden for Jews to practice it, but it is probably allowed for everyone else.

Would saying "I think the god of the Tanakh, New Testament, Qur'an and Book of Mormon is not worthy of worship" count?

Debatable, but probably not.

I don't eat anything with meat as the primary indigent but I do eat stuff with meat as a secondary indigent. I don't think eating an animal while alive will be a big deal to me. Also it is unsanitary.

Eating meat, in general is allowed. But with the cruel conditions many animals are raised today, there are actually arguments to say that this is being violated. Also things like shark fins which were torn from the animal before it dies.

What does this exactly mean? And what law?

A system of justice that society chooses for itself. 




 There is no eternal hell in Judaism, and no one is cast into "damnation."  




 Calm down. The situation you're describing is, in Jewish law, equivalent to someone who is taken captive. He is still technically has the obligation to keep the commandments, but he is not liable for any of them since he doesn't know about it. 

I'm sorry, but BONDAGE that is inherited by children and their children and their children is UNFAIR. My friend Daniel is a free agent and he decides who or what he forms a pact with.

This is a different discussion entirely. 




 And the residents of the south will continue to suffer in the meantime. It's time to end this now -- it's the best chance that we're going to get. 




 But giving in to demands without anything in return is even worse, since it further legitimizes Hamas among the Gazan population. 




 A forced cessation of hostility because they ran out of rockets is much better in the long run. This ceasefire only allows them to restock...again. 




 A ceasefire? Now? I would have been a favor of one 10 days ago. But now Hamas has few rockets left, the majority of people near Gaza have already left, and the international community's attention has turned away. Now is the time to continue until they run out of rockets and force them to demilitarize, not to **reward** Hamas for shooting rockets.  




 It lasted 2 minutes 




 It was supposed to start at 7 but rockets are still being fired. So much for the truce, then... 









 Islam is not based off Christianity the same way either is based in Judaism. 




 It's linguistic, as the ayin in mizrachi Hebrew in guttural. 




 No one died, so it apparently worked. 




 It's the opposite. The casualties are disproportionately male, ages 16-35, compared to the population. Women make up less than 20%, children 10% 




 The quotes of scholars fall somewhat flat when there are people justifying terrorism in that very thread.  




 More kid Icarus and Dr. Mario aren't necessarily confirmed. 




 I have a Rangemax wireless router wpn824 v2. It doesn't seem like the comcast one actually has better specs. In addition, it doesn't allow nearly as much configuration.  




 We just got the wireless gateway, and it seems to have a router already installed internally. Is it a good idea to use it? Is it better or worse than a standard external router? Does it allow comcast any *more* power?

Thanks. :) 




 It's Exodus 19-21. 




  Micah 5:2 But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times. 700 B.C.

This is not a prophecy that the Messiah will be born in Bethlehem, but will come from the clan of Ephrat near Bethlehem - i.e. the line of King David.  




  Matthew did not "make up" whatever ancient writing he was referencing to say this.

Matthew either made it up or referenced something of which we have absolutely no record today. Considering that the Jewish canon, including the prophets, was already codified at the time, I think the former is more likely.

 




 How exactly is the Conservative movement heretical? Reform makes sense, as they reject the Torah as binding. Conservative ideology does not. 









 Do you want to hear about my dad's experience from 40 years ago? It might no longer be relevant. :P 









 I hope that it remains a good place for now, but a shift of evangelical opinion combined with demagogues using populist attacks against "Jewish banksters" -- well, let's just say that things could turn around very quickly. 









 America is...for now. 




 To add to your analysis, Israeli news is reporting that Hamas has around 25% of its rockets left, but only a few of which can reach beyond the area right near Gaza. 




 His dissent is pretty much in line with every major news source out there. 




 What is your answer? Currently it's "Iron Dome doesn't work!" Then why are there no injuries? 




 I am looking for a reason you can give as to why there are no injuries or damage in Tel Aviv. So far you have failed to provide one.
 




 ok my bad. Israelis are the most awesome, most educated, most aware people in the world. They know everything before it happens.

If you lived in Israel then, you could see that the Patriot system didn't work, which is what people said at the time. If you live in Israel now, you can see that Iron Dome is working. How is this so difficult to get through your thick skull? Why do you believe a bad analysis of grainy images of eyewitnesses you said the true thing both times?
 




  maybe the iron dome is 90% effective...but maybe it's just like with the patriot system and it's all bs.

Again, my parents looked out their window in Tel Aviv, and saw the damage being done by the scud missiles and how the Patriot system was failing. People look out their windows now and see how Iron Dome is succeeding. Are you going to respond to this point? 

The point, that you clearly missed, is that what people THINK they know today, typically turns out to be wrong when they actually look at the details later.

And proposals vs. weapons systems being fired are two totally different things. At least the analogy to the patriot system is actually legitimate even if it shows how Iron Dome is working. A vague "wake up sheeple!" isn't going to convince anyone, you know.
 




 You're right. I was just distinguishing between batteries (of which adding more in the same area would be mostly redundant) and multiple interceptors per battery, which are already used. 




 They are adding more batteries to different areas to ensure complete protection, for example if the north and south are both attacked at once. In 2012 there were 4 or 5 batteries, I think know there are about 10 and more are being added. There is also much more support for the "Iron Beam" proposal which would stop short range mortars. 




 yet the reality we found out after the fact was that is worked less tahn 10% of the time.

And Israelis', who were the ones who were supposedly protected by it, knew during the conflict that it wasn't working. Just like they know now the Iron Dome is working.

you gotta open your mind and ears.

Fine, point me to the best. Your argument currently comes down to "wake up sheeple!" 




 Your argument would hold water if you were talking about not developing it in the first place because of the cost. You're saying this:

yes that's the problem...what people "~~see~~ want" and the reality it's used for are quite often different.

We can see what Iron Dome is doing *right now.*

look at the patriot act - after 9/11 every single person was gung ho for it because it seemed like it's protectingus.

now? it's the most unpatriotic thing and a tool for all of the recent NSA abuses.

And people warned about that when it was passed. This is a weapons system, not a law or planned war. Your analogies are awful. 




  The evidence for this is that only 22 people have died in over 15,000 rocket attacks over a decade.

This is where you analysis absolutely fails. Yes, people have died in roughly the same numbers because of other security measures, **but injuries and damages** are massively down. That is not pure chance.

you are raging so hard you didn't realize the 10% figure is the number of the effectiveness of the Patriot system. The same system that the US claimed is 90% effective...similarly to how Israel claims the Iron Dome is effective.

we won't know til later - like we found out about the patriot system.

Except Israelis knew during the Gulf War that the patriot system wasn't working by looking out their windows, just like they know the opposite now.

 




 That was the argument as to why not develop it in the first place. But the vast majority of the cost was paid in development and now it is working extremely well and people feel much safer, so no. It is actually a kind of celebrity. 




 I would more compare it to stopping a sexual assault, but whatever floats your boat! :P

I'm not here to argue with shitheads online, but to refute them so that other people reading are more informed. Trying to change posters' opinions here is useless. 




 now I understand why the bias and selective processing of information

Now you know why people like Iron Dome so much. It is not statistics released by the IDF, but what people see. 




 Mind if I copy paste this into my analysis above so we have a coordinated rebuttal? 




 I save my downvotes for Hams supporters on worldnews. Why I go there is still a mystery... 




 Israel doesn't have an military-industrial complex like America has, so the comparison to the patriot missile is bullshit. 

I agree. Take a look at the democracynow discussion. Guy makes some incredibly good points.


What are his best points? I can't see any very good ones? 




 This is an edited letter I sent to a news publication earlier to show why the 5% figure is complete bullshit:

I can definitely state that Iron Dome's intercept rate is over 5%. 

**Statistics and Analysis**

First, his analysis is not new and is mainly based on Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, not the most recent conflict, and was done using civilian photographs. (Weirdly, I can't find the original analysis itself, only reports of it.) It is not clear in yours or other articles whether he is stating that only 5% of total rockets, or 5% of rockets that Iron Dome fires at, are intercepted. A clarification would be nice in that respect, since the IDF only fires the Iron Dome when the missiles are headed to a built up area, since it are so expensive to use.

[Here is Ha'aretz on the 2012 analysis.](http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/how-many-rockets-has-iron-dome-really-intercepted.premium-1.508277
) Two articles([1](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/528916/israeli-rocket-defense-system-is-failing-at-crucial-task-expert-analysts-say/
), [2](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/528991/an-explanation-of-the-evidence-of-weaknesses-in-the-iron-dome-defense-system/
)) in the MIT technology review have been published about this. I believe the article you linked to is based on the second:

[Here are the latest IDF statistics](http://www.idfblog.com/blog/2014/08/05/operation-protective-edge-numbers/
) of rockets fired at Israel (note: as of 8/05):

* 3,360 rockets fired 
* 2,303 hit Israel (70%)
* 475 hit gaza (14%) 
* 584 intercepted by Iron dome (17%)

If the IDF claims an 80% success rate of Iron Dome, that means:

* they fired at about 730 (22% of total rockets)
* and missed 150 (5% of total rockets) 
* Most of the 2000+ rockets that did hit would have hit open areas, but not all.

5% effectiveness related to total rockets would be 150 intercepted, which is 20% attempted interceptions, nothing to sneeze at though still not great. 5% of attempted interceptions would be only about 40 rockets. Which is it?

**Refutation**

Second, His analysis is pretty easy to refute, not by looking at grainy images, but by looking at warnings, damages, and casualties. There have been over 30 sirens in the Tel Aviv area; unlike your article states, most of it is apartment buildings or high rises, not open space. (If you want to see a city with open space, go to Be'ersheva.) As far as I can tell, and I have been following updates closely, there have not been one rocket reported to actually hit the area. How is this possible if Iron Dome only intercepts 5% of the rockets it launches at? The expensive, Iranian made Fajr-5 missiles actually use a targeting system and would be aimed toward civilian populations.

And the places further south (Kiryat Melachi, Ashdod, Ashkelon, etc.) seem to have much less damage than they did in the 2008 war. You're the reporter, not me, so this is something you can research, but my impressions were that it was unsafe to at all live in those areas during that war, and there was a lot of destruction. This year, there have been very few reports of damages, while I remember almost every day I heard about rocket damage in 2008 and 2012. 
During this operation there have been only **3 civilian deaths and 22 injuries** (according to the IDFblog which seems to have stopped updating in mid-July, but I can't imagine that it is more than 50 injuries) while in 2008, according to Wikipedia, **600+ were injured** (4,000 rocket attacks) and in 2012 it was **almost 300** (3,000 rocket attacks). This is another place your analysis and/or the professor's fails; yes, the deaths are about the same, but as he says deaths are unlikely anyway. However, injuries and damages are dramatically down while rockets, and more targeted and damaging rockets, are up. This would make no sense if Iron Dome wasn't working. 

*TL;DR A 10-20 fold decrease in injuries, and massively reduced reports of damages, is absurd if Iron Dome wasn't successful.*

**Feeling of Security**

Furthermore, anyone on the ground can tell you there is a large difference between this war and 2008. There is a different sound if a rocket hits the ground, a rocket explodes on the ground, or an Iron Dome intercepts a rocket. There have been multiple reports of shrapnel falling from destroyed rockets. People feel much safer because they notice my points above. **Iron Dome is not a celebrity in Israel because people see it shooting and the IDF publishes statistics, but because they can see that the destruction from Hamas is severely limited now that it has been deployed all across the south.**

**Conspiracy**

Final point: It would require an incredible conspiracy to cover all of this up (/r/conspiracy levels!). There are lots of people working or have worked on Iron Dome, and they would have to prevent anyone from speaking about its failure. If there has been damages from rockets hitting buildings, like the one that killed 3 in 2012, it would need to be covered up. If there were no rockets fired at the Tel Aviv area, the only other conclusion from my above analysis, then fake Red Alert sirens would have to be ordered and then covered up. None of these are plausible.

Is it possible the IDF is exaggerating somewhat? Possibly. But nothing on the order of a 5% of claimed interceptions or of total rockets. We would be seeing entirely different results on the ground if that was the case.

Edit: Your points are addressed above as well, but to show specifically why you are wrong:

it has more to do with the crude and shitty rockets being used than the Iron Dome.

Then why are damages and injuries down so much if Iron Dome wasn't working?

 Also, the thing that keeps Israelis safest isn't the Iron Dome - it's the incredibly effective and well deployed early warning system that allows people to find cover quickly

Absolutely. But even with this system over 600 people were injured in 2008, and we are seeing nothing on that level today. Statistics of damages are much harder to find, but it seems to be a lot less as well.

Studies have shown that even a 5 second warning, allowing someone to lie/duck down and cover, increases surivability by 60%+ Makes sense if you think about the explosion and trajectory of debris.

**Survivability =/ Injuries.** Yes, they might survive, but could still be moderately or severely injured. Your analysis doesn't explain the discrepancy. 
 




 From what I've read, it's mostly three and four. There are already 3 potential interceptors fired from each battery before the rocket hits the ground, and each interceptor costs $20,000 to fire.

 




 He hasn't been following the news. The 90%+ figure was only at the start of this conflict. 




 So you should support Al-Qaeda and not Hamas! 




 This article was published today and the Jerusalem post is a pretty major news source. 




 Everyone remember this: Hamas first says one thing to the west and then another thing to their supporters. The same will come out about the death count in Gaza once everyone has stopped paying attention; innocent civilians will magically transform into heroic martyrs who fought to the death. 




 Is there any statement in American law which says the purpose of American citizens is to follow those laws? 




 Ok, now I'm just confused what your response has to do with my original comments... 




 Operation Protective Edge is not Operation Brother's Keeper, and both occurred with provocations, not randomly. 




 Yep, just correcting because these kinds of misconceptions can be easily propagated, as the history of christianity shows. 




  The kitzur's issue with flames not being at the same height (and the Ah"S would probably agree) is the latter. 

Except aren't these requirements still valid whether or not a shamash is present? This seems to indicate that the problem addressed is showing that the 8 as one unit but still distinct from one another, not that they are a unit which are separate from the shamash.

 




 Also, KJV, not JKV.

Thanks.

The simple fact that a significant portion of rabbinic texts are written in Aramaic and are, in many cases, considered more authoritative than the original text of the Hebrew Bible itself undercuts the notion that Hebrew was the authoritative language.

Yes, all true. But you said:
the only accepted version of the Qur'an is one that is in Arabic, whereas this is not the case with the Hebrew Bible

scriptural texts written in English...are all just as authoritative as the original languages

This is what I am disputing, not that there are many texts written in other languages in Jewish and halachic literature. You are giving the impression that the **translation** of a Hebrew Bible into English, or a Talmud into the same, is as authoritative as the original text.

 




 Are either of these two things incorrect? Jewish converts to Christianity are not expected to follow the Torah, and from a Jewish viewpoint worshipping Jesus is idolatry.  




 Yes, but it is an addendum and not part of the requirement. It reads like this:

Do not follow a man who leads you astray by telling you to worship other Gods, even if he performs miracles, for God is testing you by sending him. 




 Yes? All 8 candles must be recognizable as being lit together -- but the shamash must be separate so as not to be confused, which I see as the biggest problem here. Neither of your sources here seem to address that. 




 Just so that there is no bad blood between us, I never downvoted you. 




 From what I have learned, it is the commonly held belief in Rabbinic Judaism after the fall of the second Temple. Even among the modern, liberal streams of Judaism translations are much more acceptable but not authoritative, especially compared to how the JKV is treated among many Christian sects. Do you have a source that says otherwise? 




  If that's true provide a reference for it.

Start with [this wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_antisemitism). Click on the links on top of the subsections for expanded explanations. This is all burned into the Jewish collective memory.

Reference?

See the link above, specifically the arguments among early church fathers and the Spanish Inquisition. If you want to read more on the latter, google conversos, crypto-Jews, and marranos.
 
Considered them backward? I thought they were tortured and killed? (Really, can you source any of this?)

Augustine is the most commonly given example. Again, read the opinions of early church fathers on Jews and Judaism. 




 Oh, I do that too. I mean that when the problem continues afterwards and they continue to complain without doing anything. 




 three months is "right after" now? Who knew! 




 Of course, I meant that the shamash flame must be different in some way from all of the others. 




  For many Christians and Jews, scriptural texts written in English (or French, or German, or Swahili, what have you) are all just as authoritative as the original languages. 

I do not believe that this is true in Judaism. The original language is always the best, as far as I have seen. 




 Would it be possible to delete the old bigoted posts? 




  Go talk shit about israel

Yeah, this might be the problem. Criticizing and talking shit are two different things. 




  we are held to a higher standard than the believers of the OT

How is not following the law being held to a higher standard? 




  In other words, jews follow the letter of the law and christian follow the spirit of the law.

The spirit of the Law is quite clearly to follow the letter of the law, which christians don't do.
 




 The person would be considered raised as a captive. That means that he would be breaking commandments (which is based on actions, not intentions) but would not be held as liable for what he did. 




 I meant that just because someone in Gaza tweets something expressing sympathy of someone in America does not mean that Hamas doesn't want to kill them. 




  Peter didn't do either of these two things. Or if he did, she me where (again, chapter and verse). 

1. The Church, which is based on Peter's teachings, told Jews to not follow the Law.

2. Peter and the Church both told Jews to follow other gods (Jesus). 

Fits pretty well.
 




 For very good reasons. 




 such as, that there were foods that "defiled a man", in the sense that they, of themselves, had the power of making someone unclean.

Why do you think that Jews ever taught this?

 I said above that Peter never instructed any Torah observant Jews to disobey one iota of Torah. Nor did I suggest anywhere that Jesus told any of his Jewish followers to disregard Torah.

Except it is your church that has multiple times, over the past 2000 years, given Jews living in its lands two options: convert or die. And if converted, they could not keep the old laws under pain of torture and death. Even when they were suffered to live, the Church considered them backwards for keeping the Law that God enjoined upon them, and celebrated converts from Judaism (who, incidentally, were not required to keep the Law).

 




  Jews were used to seeing Gentiles as "unclean", like dogs

Why do you think this is true?

These cleanliness laws, as well as circumcision, built up a "wall of separation" between Israel and "the Nations".

Why did God make a law, which he called eternal, only to tear it down a few years later?
 




 *Christianity* doesn't make sense. Don't tar all religions with the same brush, though. 




 Correction: A false prophet is someone who causes people to transgress by claiming that he is receiving a divine message. Performing miracles is not part of the criteria. The Torah just says that miracles should be irrelevant to the message. 




 There are only two things God created that can be classified as evil: death and free will. Just because God created them doesn't mean he cannot be good. 




 I guess hit on = attempted rape now... 




 From what I learned in high school, the most important thing (edit: in this case) is that the Shamash is distinct. Both could work if you place a visibly different candle in the shamash holder, I think. 




 Then can you also explain why women *do* it? "Venting" without wanting a solution, ever. Sympathy without a solution, like the person above said. 




 Send a few "summary" paragraphs and ask him out on a date. Otherwise it's a little bit too much in the beginning. Use the rest to guide how you would like to express your feelings in person. 




 Could you list/link to all the army ranks in Hebrew with the english equivalents?  




 You mean the one that the US took over through an aggressive war less than 200 years ago? Mexico has a right to that land!  




 They'll be faulted regardless of what they do. 




 Hamas =/ individual Palestinians 




 Many of the alleged conspirators are Hamas members who were released as part of the Shalit deal and then rearrested. These are the same people that Hamas is demanding be set free as part of the ceasefire negotiations.

I wonder how this will change the Hamas-PA unity pact which has still been technically in effect throughout this war? 









 From a previous point of mine about why Isaiah 53 is clearly about Israel:

Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.

Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.

Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? On the other hand, (the house of) Israel fulfills all of this! In context with chapters 52 and 54, if one is a believer, one could see the prophecy be fulfilled today. If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here. 




 Me? No. Do some commentators? Yes. 




 Judaism's view: It's a debate whether it was slight of hand or actual magic.  




 Do you want me to go through these and show that each and every one is, to quote from above, "not a prophecy at all, not a messianic prophecy, or taken so far out of context that it's purported to mean the opposite of what it actually means?" 




 How is this the letter of the law? Sabbath mode just disables the electronic displays and auto turn off. It's the exact same thing as having a constant fire going. 




 It'd be like saying that we can worship other Gods now

Funny thing us, that is what was done with Jesus and all afterwards. 




 What's interesting is that the symptoms described by galphanore are very similar to the real ones after fasting/long term malnourishment. But the latter are a lot more...insidious, I guess? 




 It's too goddamn long and not much happens.
