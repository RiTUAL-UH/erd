Is there a way to keep a snapshot of it for future reference without fearing the next tree will break the paths?  



























































 I always create a group before going into maps (i farm masters, so I want to share it PA) - the group is created **public**. I cannot change it to private until someone joins. Why is that? it doesn't make sense. 

Also, when the last person (besides me) leaves or even if I kick the last person - the group closes (sometimes it doesn't, I haven't figured out when) and I need to create a new one. Why is that? 

I should be able to create a perma private group. 





























 And 7+ masters should spawn rare areas (up to 6 mods). 














 I'm trying to use life formula to match my actual number, and I'm coming short. 

According to the wiki:

     Life = (38 + (Level * 12) + (Strength / 2) + additive modifiers) * (100% + multiplicative modifiers)

On the gear I have +288 life and +36% to max life (Belly of the Beast). Per PoEBuilder I have +20/+138% from the tree.

So the calculation coming up as:

    Life = (38 + (86 * 12) + (213 / 2) + 20 + 288) * (100% +36% + 138%) =   4067

My life is just over 4200, so where am I missing 200 HP?
 
























 Preferably wrapped up in a GroupBox. Any hints and ideas? Thanks. (PS reading the files isn't the issue here, just the dynamically adding buttons inside a groupbox)

Update. Okay so basically I create those 2 functions, and I think it will work for me (the variables are self explanatory - x,y,w,h and some margins in between):


    add_group(group_number, group_name)
    {
    	global
    	group_y := (group_number - 1) * group_h + 10 
    	Gui, Add, GroupBox, xm ym+%group_y%  Section w%group_w% h%group_h% , %group_name%
    }

    add_button_to_group(sub_name, caption, is_first=false)
    {
    	global
    	if (is_first)
    	{
    		Gui, Add, Button,  xs+%gui_m% 			ys+%gui_m% w%gui_w%  h30 g%sub_name% , %caption%
    	}
    	else
    	{
    		Gui, Add, Button,  xp+%gui_w_margin% 	ys+%gui_m% w%gui_w%  h30 g%sub_name% , %caption%
    	}
    }

To use it, I simply call:

    add_group(1,"Shortcuts #1") 
    add_button_to_group("RunSomething1", "Name #1", true)

    add_group(2,"Shortcuts #2")
    add_button_to_group("RunSomething2", "Name #2", true)
    add_button_to_group("RunSomething3", "Name #3" )
 


























































































































































 Or do I need to scan my gear one by one? 

















































 When I purchase a decoration I see, for example, 11 Variations (Crypt Tomb). What does it mean? how do I get more variations? is it just between masters?  





























 I used Flesh Offering in my previous two summoners, and I wad wondering about switching to BO. My question is, do attack and spell block really boost the minions' survivability, especially against AOE bosses? 



























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 I just downloaded it and gave it a try, the things I'm missing are:

* Is there a slideshow mode? in BaconReader I can view the post full screen (image, webpage, etc) and then slide right to the next one. Very convenient for image focused subs. Couldn't find this option here.
*  When clicking on a post on the front page, I get directly to the post content. Is there a way to get directly to the comments (skipping the slide up part)?
* Is there a way to collapse all comments by default?
* I have some subs I view often, but I don't want to subscribe to them. So I added them manually without subscribing, that's cool - just like BR. However when I sync my subs, the new ones were deleted. Is it a bug?

Thanks. The app looks great.
