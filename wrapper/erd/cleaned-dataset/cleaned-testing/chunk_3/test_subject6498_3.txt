 I can only speak for myself, but I think the graphic novels are **superb**. Not much differs from the novellas in regards of the text. Though I am not an expert.  




 Patience my dear Padawan. It will all come. So long as HBO doesn't fuck up the rights, or sell them to Warner we are all good. 




 You are keeping a good pace! My tip is don't rush. There are vital information on almost every page, and you only got one chance to read the books for the first time.  




 They had Dragonstone for a long time before moving there. It was the westernmost outpost of the Valyrians.  




 The Golden Company started as Blackfyre loyalists.  




 Casualness, casualness, casualness. 




 No it's more the setting of Bloodraven. He should have one eye with roots digging into his very flesh. He just sat there like a regular dude.  




 Also Doctor Who is pretty overwhelming when it comes to brittish guest actors.

**'t'was a lot more than I realized.**
 




 Benjen is the Nights King confirmed 




 Rhaegar?   




 yes, partially. 




 *"Unreliable Narrator"* is GRRM's explanation that describes the whole "Wylla scenario"
The name of the series "A Song of ice and Fire" should add some thought.  




 Nice thought. Could be they travel past it, and we get a bit of history. 




 Brynden Rivers is Ravenclaw 

Dunk is Hufflepuff

 




 The thought as come across my mind as well.  




 Thanks!  




 YES. But make sure to get A Feast for Crows expansion as well. Vanilla with less than 6 players is a bit broken, but the exp-pack makes the game a 4-player objective based game that doesn't take 6+ hours. 




 The Lady of the Vale will probably open her arms wide when Dany arrives through I would think. It was to Aegon and his dragons Torrhen Stark bent his knee. I think Sansa will remember that. 




 I wonder if they are preparing people to see Game of Thrones at the cinema.. 6 seasons and a movie, anyone? 




 There is also the sun Daenerys remembers. The sun rarely shines in Braavos. 
You should read the Luke and Leia post if you are interested in the theory. I quite like it, although we *have to wait and see* 




 He hasn't lied about his unfaithfulness because he refuse to speak about them as to make any more lies. I think R+L=J is solid. Totally fits the title of the book. What I don't know is The frickin' lemon tree. There are plenty in Dorne, but none known in Braavos. Rain and Fog doesn't give lemontrees a chance.

But if Daenerys was born in Dorne? Is she the daughter of Aerys? Viserys was a miracle after millions of miscarriages (10?)
The whole Luke and Leia post really got me thinking.. I think I will make another as to put fire on the discussion. 




 I watched John Oliver on net neutrality. And he got me thinking. Internet Providers basically has us in our grips. 
I will provide a personal example which I hope others will too.

Watch the very informative John Oliver explain it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU

 nbsp;
**In Sweden**, where I don't think it is as bad as in the US, the status quo is:

*-* 3 or 4 big providers for countryside and suburbs.

 
*-* Around two more advanced providers additionally avalible in larger cities.

My sister lives three blocks from me in a smaller city, separated by a main road. I have access to one of the big ones exclusively, and she has access to the other two.

The one I've got also has cheaper service in student-apartments.

 nbsp;

If one could gather information on avalability you could possibly prove that they have areas of control for reduced competition and therefore possibly *illegal(?)* monopoly on the market. 




 I'd take some *Unsullied*, Dothraki riders and freed slaves for archers, grab an Ironborn fleet that is cruisin' nearby and go straight for The Vale of Arryn. 

Conquer it in a couple of days with my 3 dragons. And then I'd have an inconquerable stronghold from which I send letters saying "Bend the knee, or I will fry you like bacon. **Burnt black.**


*But hey, why not chill in a pyramid?* 




 You should call HBO or GRRM's marketing guys. Use the interwebz to find a number somewhere.  




 Upvote for flair, but well. This is old news on this sub I would say
t'was the redditor Honey-something who discovered the Benjen stuff.

**How much Anne Groell knows about where George is in his process has been disputed by the Maesters for centuries.**
 




 I like your spirit. *But we'll have to wait and see!* 




 Dunk of course.. 

 




 Want to fit this into my own tinfoil of Bran warging Dunk with the help of Bloodraven. 

Sworn Sword: "It was if some God put the words in my mouth" 

Remember how Bran desperately wanted to be a Knight and is told he never will be. 

Well, as it happens Dunk isn't a Knight, and still is the most chivalrous Knight in Westeros?   




 Jaime is going to the Riverlands in the end of the seasons though right?  




 http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0265610/

Her schedule seems a little light, am I right?

One movie completed and a tv series that I don't think have been shooting this fall if I am reading the air-dates correctly.


She is born in Ireland, so she would have reason to be basically on location..
**I have hope**, but I am ready for a dissappointing surprise. 




 Well. if R+L=J, Aegon i fakeon then J = the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, since he is the last male heir to the throne. 
 




 That would be ironical considering how Ned's oldest son does exactly the opposite and well.. 




 That's how I first interpreted it. Now I don't really know. it feels like some old gods magic to me but.. well it's in my titles. 




 Really like this theory.

*But we will have to wait and see!* 




 average would be average health.  




 You'll have to wait and see. 




 The dragon must have three heads.
Daenerys eggs,  Lyanna's crypt and Aegon with greyscale? 
Sure, *but you'll have to wait and see!*
 




 The significance here I would say lies in that you could identify another Warg?  




 The big three. D or J i would guess.  




 Got mit uns!  




 I feel that Bran is not so bad in the books? His chapters are like magic,  magic, magic. Awesome magic.  Show Bran is whiney as hell.  




 Worth noting is that the English version will be **heavily** illustrated. The ones released in other languages this year will not be..  




 AFFC is slow. It picks up but not to the extent of ASOS. 




 I got the black one! Just had to say that. 




 Yeah, visiting Gibraltar Casterly Rock was all I thought about. 
That and the Neanderthals. 




 April 1st right? 




 Maybe! You'll have to wait and see. 




 Coldhands = Brandon the Builder confirmed?  




 Maybe the best casting of season 1? 




 I hate that the door seeminly have been painted white :( 




 I think CH is an old (old) dude. First Men for sure. Maybe a Stark, maybe just nobody. (But probably a Stark) 




 That TES V: Skyrim was a bit influenced by A Song of Ice and Fire is certain. Dragons, The Northerners rebel against the kingdom (empire). Riften is basically Braavos and Windhelm and Winterhold makes me think of Winterfell. 
Oh, and Draugers..

But I came to thinking about TES IV: Oblivion, and Brother Martin is the **illegitimate son of Emperor Uriel Septim VII**, and the last remaining of that ancient bloodline. In the beginning of the game, he is sworn as a munk. At the end, he turns into a dragon.

Am I grasping for air, or is The Elder Scrools very influenced by A Song of Ice and Fire?
**Bethesda was almost about to make a licensed Game of Thrones!**

http://www.vg247.com/2011/09/15/bethesda-why-we-turned-down-a-game-of-thrones/ 









 I do not think they hold a finished novel in ASOIAF. They want that out ASAP. George could be sharing information with his publisher though. It's just the readers frustration he is tired of, right? 




 Why not. We have nothing better to do than wondering about how potatoes got to Westeros anyway.

New editions for A Song of Ice and Fire are releasing in October this year. Which could very well be Harper Voyagers way of cashing in inbetween the wait for the next big payday.

But I always keep a good look on GRRM's website. Particulary the tour-dates.
http://www.georgerrmartin.com/appearances/
The next big convention is The Pacific Northwests Science-Fiction Fantasy Convention which almost coincides with the Season 5 premier date. And after that if follows with Fantasy conventions all year long.

**Let's speculate** Our dream would come true if GRRM announces this April with a summer/autumn release. 

My more modest but still falthering hope is we have the book by Spring 2016, before season 6 starts. 




 Maybe it's 6 books?

*The Winds of Winter Confirmed*?

 




 God I would hate this. And I have nightmares about it happening. **It happend to Half Life 2.** 




 She was young, madly in love and probably naive as well.

 




 "I'm gonna give you a clout on the ear". **so hard you'll fly across the lake."**

SearchDE! "clout" 




 Gave my10 YO nephew KSP for christmas. He love building planes. Well. Even I can't build functional planes, but he loads in a stock one, and mods them. Finding out what works and what don't. 

Children are awesome. Trial and Error has made him capable of landing and starting again. I have high hopes for him being the first astronaut visiting Europa. ;) 




 This is the kind of post that makes me and my accomplishments in this game feel so small. 




 I don't understand these kinds of threads. 
Not saying you can't wonder, but I don't see what's interesting about Westeros having food that originated from the Americas.
**There is a wall made of ice, 700 feet high for christ sake.** Let them have their lemon cakes and potatoes. 




 I suspect he will be Bran's tool. Broking a peace between the Others and Westeros. 
Or he will frikkin' kill all the Others with his burning sword. 




 Kings who ate, drank and fucked around is not something new. I am sure he based King Robert Baratheon on some of the old kings in history who has been known to have a few similar traits as 'Ole Bobby B 




 Well. Benjen should be a candidate? 
Maybe TreeBran aswell? 




 'Ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow. 




 Simplifying. Simplifying. Simplifying... HBO fears viewers will go away from that episode wondering "Well, who the hell is Cat?" 

**I think distrusting viewer's intelligence is the greatest crime of television writing today.** 




 Later Dunk sends the smallfolk home, defying Ser Eustace and Ser Bennis.. *"It was if some god had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior"*..

Bred my theory of Bran influencing Dunk. The Castle Wall through weirnet  somehow. Maybe because he is Hodor's grandgrandfather or something.
**"He knew every stone of that wall".** 




 I feel what you write could be true, but not relevant to the story.

It could just as easy be an homage to Tokiens's "The Undying Lands" which lies west of Middle Earth. 




 Em-Com would even be right :) 




 Regrettably no.. I needed to fly past Ike for a science contract and this came up. It was easily corrected but I felt like sharing it because it looks kind of hilarious. 









 You have to read up on the **R+L=J** "theory". There are so much foreshadowing for that theory it is generally regarded as a known fact. 




 HBO makes Dunk and Egg mini series with 3 episodes 




 Robert was the heir to his house, Baratheons are known to be proud. Ned was a second son of the quiet house Stark. 




 Wow Thanks guys, exactly what I'm looking for!
 




 I must first say. I suck at building spaceplanes. I have watched Scott Manley building but it is really hard.

I bit into Career into beta, ship costs are really expensiv. So a cheap reusable ship to carry loads for stations and such would be really handy.

I wonder if anyone here have a good build with stock parts for a shuttle taking of vertically or horizontally with high cargo capability or wants to create one for this purpose would be a Kerbal King.

If it looks like one of Nasa's Shuttles. Bonus points! 




 Volantis is close to Valyria. Well relatively.
They have a lot of experience about the waters thereabouts and know any ship going to Valyria won't return. They knew Tommen II was going to die in Valyria, so they followed him and stole all he had and killed them?

Why not! :D 




 Ordered the book 1-4 moments after seeing episode 10 of season 1. so I knew everything there. 
When I had read aFfC I was depressed, but happily realized book 5 had just been released!  




 Oh my. Are we having **another** rebellion? You must be kidding me. 




 As an honourable man of the North he felt he could be useful at the Wall. You must remember The North look at serving in the Watch as a great deed. Jorah could handle Bear Island (well).. 




 Yes, and that's what she would say should she be in the next season.

http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0265610/

Her schedule is pretty empty, she might appear.
I won't be surprised if they cut her though. 




 Yeah. screw Brienne right? 




 His blog is down? tWoW release for christmas 2014 confirmed ! 




 ** can see why people downvote you to hell...** Should actors have been contacted a script would be done. Then we would have producers already working on it and somewhere along the way it would have leaked.

You will be considered a troll making such statements without a source. And don't say it's because you can't say anything else. This is the internet, not the streets of North Korea. 




 I too have vague memory of HBO owning all rights... :( 




 I think you may be right. Bloodraven is in them though, and Maester Aemon could easily be made fit to make a cameo in the beginning to gather interest. **And I think with the proper title and a "pilot" with many references to characters and events we heard of**, HBO could make people interested in Dunk   Egg. 

**Any suggestions**?

"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms" is actually pretty good.

"A True Knight of Westeros" would be more eyecatching. 




 Sweet summer child. GRRM had the whole story fleshed out in 1995..
It has nothing to do with that. It is the dialogues, the foreshadowing and the subtle hints in every other paragraph that makes these book take so fucking long a time to write. That and the 1500 pages of manuscript each one consist of... 




 Agree on Robert's rebellion.

However I don't feel Dunk and Egg is quite epic enough to make it to the big screen. It's still good drama though with a good climax in each story. As I mentioned in the OP, BBC's Sherlock has a quite fitting way of doing it. With 3 episodes per year each 1 and a half hour in length. 

It could be awesome considering each novella is a separate story still connected to the other two. 




 I am so glad you shared this life changing revelation! It invites to a lengthy discussion indeed!  




 Well. I don't know how to answer that without offending you. 




 Good point. We would get to see how Rhaegar fought nobly and get to know the Targaryen family first hand before diving in to the great history. 




 I would like to see the conquest, dance of dragons and blackfyre rebellions made with the budgets they deserve. Because even though the series-format makes for a dramaturgically better story I can't help to believe the lower budgets that comes with it would basically massacre some of the grander events visually.  









 Barely nothing word by word. But he wrote the whole Targaryen history, too long to be in the book. Elio and Linda shortened it down. Georges version will be published later as a complete history of the Targaryens. 




 Foreshadowing for revenge of some sort I would say! Bran will remember the whole history of Westeros and most likely the whole world, so I doubt I is in regards to that.  




 Wasn't it steel that came with the Andals? 
I feel the first men came with bronze as their main metal, but had discovered iron by the time of the long night, what 4000 years later? 

And the others aren't vulnerable to iron. They just hate it as it is an object crafted by man. 
At least that is how I perceive it.  




 He replied to a comment on his blog once. That's it and I don't see why it's a big deal. 




 You sweet summer child. You know nothing of fear. 




 E-LL-I-O-T? 




 They said it to boost sales. Really lame.
He wrote it 10 years prior to ASOIAF. it can't be set in westeros, because 1981 Westeros didn't exist. 




 I really think Alfie Allen has portrayed Reek so extremely good. He was an ok Theon. But he really is Reek.

I just want him reeling about and rhyme a lot on his name next season and I will be fully satisfied. 




 I consider it an "in-universe history". Most historical things are correct, but description of events crucial for ASOIAF are false or missing.

I got it for christmas (waiting was really hard). And I have read some small portions about the Dawn age and some of the Targ kings. And I must say, though it is exceptionally interesting. The Art is really what blew my mind. Dunk vs The Laughing Storm made my jaw drop. 

**I really (really) hope HBO makes Dunk and Egg into a series. Maybe like Sherlock, with 3 episodes each year about 1 and a half hour in length."**
That would make 3 seasons. 
HBO should prepare for such a series in the Show with Bran somehow. Just hinting at it with something to make the stories intertwine a bit. 




 same here..
