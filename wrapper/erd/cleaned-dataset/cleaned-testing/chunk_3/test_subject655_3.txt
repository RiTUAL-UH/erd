 Huh?  What advantage could netflix have by asking this question?  It'd obviously have more against it than for it.   

I asked because they were talking about it on the "news" today.   




 I like that "netflix free" idea.  

Would be nice to be able to catch their series for free with ads.  It might actually drive people to sign up for ad free subscription.   









 With the exception of Everquest, Runescape is probably the biggest old title game around right now.    




 You're a superhero; but would you feel cooler if your last name were West?  




  FPH: Fucking People Heavywhere.    




 Stay off of INTERNET personals everybody.  


FTFY 
 




 It's subjective. 




 So you don't advocate a gun on every mans hip like in the old west?

I've heard the argument (and I don't know that this is true) that hollywood gunfights didn't happen that much in the old west because every man was armed.  The "mutual assured destruction" argument. I guess.  

I have slow internet in the philippines but I'm only seeing a couple  of real big gun battles in searching. Like Kansas city and tombstone.  Tombstone's gun battle is actually overstated a lot.  

So I guess in early search I can kind of substantiate that claim.  We certainly didn't have near the deaths we are currently having.... for whatever, probably multiple, reasons.   




 That's patented tho.... so it really doesn't matter if the original is still there.   

That's how companies get protected from scammers making a copycat iphone.   The whole reason for the patent system is so that peoples shit doesn't get stolen. 




 Yes but does his exective power extend to unilaterally changing drug classifications?  I thought it was congress that had to do that.    




 "Remember to play in the street all day, Kids!"  


I'd be such a good dad. 




 That's true.   But saying "white people are superior" isn't really threatening or terroristic as "lets hang all black people".     

The later is a direct threat of actually harming another, whilst the former is just uttered nonsense that we should point and laugh at in a shaming manner.   

One is the very definition of a "terroristic threat".   The other is not and could never be construed as such legally.   

Public shaming works.... to a degree.  Until you drive them all together and underground.   Then once they are excluded by society, they have no reason to follow that society's rules.  

So in a way, you shrink the size of the groups but in being cornered they lash out more.   

That's a whole different can of worms.   

I would most certainly feel threatened if I were black and whites were running around saying they were "superior".... but probably not as worried as if the whites started saying "lets kill everyone who's not white".

 Try reading.  He's in one thread defending stealing.  Then he's in this thread arguing the opposite.   I suspect you're his alt.  




 It's good.  I read it all.   It was informative without being a long say nothing word salad. 




 Thanks for all the info.  You've given me a lot to chew on for a while.   

Hard to cut through the hysteria when the topics of guns comes up.   So it's hard to really allow opinions to evolve in that environment.    




 Does Obama have that power? 




 Yeah... no Asian immigrants is how our railroads were built. /s 




 Until reading your post I have been against the electoral college.   Kudos on the CMV on that. 




 Only if they engage in violence or threats.... 




  but at its core states rights was always about the right of slavery.

 What????  

No.... States rights has been used to defend slavery but that doesn't mean that's it's sole purpose; which is to keep the federal government from micromanaging states.   So chill with the dogma... 




 Yeah I'm a bit on the fence with that.  I do know that we don't need assault rifles with huge magazines on the street. Weapons of war have no business flooding the streets.   But like you pointed out there is no way of undoing that without forcefully stripping people of them.  Which is more wrong than having them in my mind.   At least mandatory training and safety classes would be nice. 




 I think I might have not communicated correctly.  I mean if we did not infringe on our rights to own weapons then there would be non such thing as illegal sales. Because every single sale would be legal no matter what.

 




 It's both sort of.   This is how violent criminals get their hands on so many unregistered firearms.   It sort of fuels the black market.

Edit:  although there would be no need for a black market if we just stopped restrictions on gun purchases in every state.  

 




 Thanks!   Wyoming says fuck you.

 [Kudzu grows at about the same speed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudzu_in_the_United_States)  

And while it is considered a nuisance plant it actually has a ton of uses, is edible, and contains many medicinal properties.   During the summer we would coil individual vines around stakes and lay them on a ruler.   You can literally see it moving slowly... like watching a shadow move from the sun.   

Whoevers vine grew the most won the bet.    




 What is the gun per capita number for each state?    




 AZ doesn't pay any mind to the casuals of other states. 




 "You can't sing worth a heck with a big hole in your neck... no you don't always die from tobacco."



On a side note, I like how it was supposed to show you can't sing by using a catchy song. 




 It's not about the ashtray.... it's about winning the fight. 




 I'm just saying if it's not on Netflix or hulu why would I sign up for a third temporary service just to watch it.   

Just make the content available... then I might have been enticed to watch it on TV for the current season.  

The point is,  with all the other available content, Imy not going to go out of my way to watch something that takes going through a signup and cancellation of service process.

They killed themselves.  That's not my fault, that's their's for choosing to limit the size of the audience their content reaches.


It's like putting ice cream shop at the top of a long flight of stairs whilst 2 other ice cream shops are already positioned at the bottom.  Unless your product is immensely better and your prices lower, few are going to take the extra trip to visit you. 




 You should be embarrassed for yourself and trying to justify theft as "common sense".  Get out of here with that nonsense.    Good job on your faux embarrassment over me calling you out on your immensely huge B.S.

Good day. 




 Look at how mad he gets when his hypocrisy is displayed to the world.   Wow!   Have fun getting your door kicked in for stealing copyright material because you were too cheap to pay for it. 




 [Umm you were just in another thread making excuses for stealing the content.](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/3ar4ap/nbc_has_canceled_hannibal/csfbfy7) 




 Yeah. Wtf is he talking about the selection is bad?   Sure some of it his lower budget on average but as we've seen recently, simply throwing a ton of money at a project doesn't make it any good.

These people are just thieves.   And they want any lame reason they can think of to serve as an excuse for being leeches. 




 Bro... he has to PAY for it then.  He clearly just wants it for free and all these lame overstated reasons are simply justification for theft.  




 I get its hard to watch it... but stealing it is not the solution.  It's hard to buy a car.  That doesn't mean you just take whatever one you see on the street. 




 Yeah but you can't keep doing free trials everytime a show is on tv.   

The point is its a pain to access it... so why do it?  There are si many other shows that are available that aren't so difficult to access.  


 




 I couldn't hardly get through the first season.  It was so gratuitous and bad. 




 I've owned a lot of trucks and I don't think I've owned one with vents in that location since the 90s.   I don't know where they are now... but not there.   

Regardless those vents wash all liquids away from where the air is pulled in.  

Most people use recycled air settings as it is more efficient and you don't smell the pollution from other cars in front. 




 I'll just pick up some tomatoes, cucumbers, and 80 kilos of calcium hypochlorate. 




 Yup.  How many architects are also master programmers?   It's likely he wouldn't understand it... not that he isn't capable but he just hasn't ever learned it.   

 




 It tellsh me that gooshshtepping moronsh like you should try reading booksh inshtead of **BURNING** them.

Oh wait I'm not in the Sean connery thread anymore. 




 Ewww his undies. 




 Oh phew.   I'm good then. That's what I do.  

I thought I had Monsters Inside Me.   Fuck that show really hard. 




 That's just seasoning. 




 It means everything I wanted was taken so I said fuck it and made it as lame as possible. 




 Those percentages are huge and scary.  

Do these parasites reside within the vegetables or can they be washed off?   




 Yeah... and they sell them to WA and Org.   No one said the beer had to be brewed in the state that consumes it.  It was a joke anyway, Mr. Know-it-all-correct-everyone. 




 That's it.   




 Who is they?  




 As a basement dwelling expert my twinkies don't have ecoli. 




 Sauce? 




 Cali only. Oregon and WA just drink obscure piss tasting small brewery beer and type on typewriters in the most ridiculous places. 




 That's it I'm not eating anymore so that I can live forever. 




 Dude... Fucking cool it. 




 turns out its way up in the fucking sky like on morrowind. 




 Well yeah... no one is paying tax really at that wage level.  

Americans are about manufactured crisis.  Gotta stop all those tax dodging food servers.  When it's REALLY about giving businesses a pass on paying people a wage they can live off of. 




 If he doesnt die of old age by then....  He will be 79 at the end of his first term...  He better have a damn good Vice President for me to vote for him because odds are that VP will be required to replace him. 




 Well this pope isn't likable to the whole world.  

He pissed a lot of people off here in the Philippines; where the demands he made for his visit required money for Yolanda recovery to be diverted to his needs.  Then he dipped out as soon as a small tropical storm hit.  I guess he didn't have enough FAITH that God would keep him safe.   




 feeding stray animals is illegal?  




 Well the whole reason they make less than minimum wage is because tips cover the difference and also taxes.  

If you erase the difference then the only reason is taxes.  The law was originally passed on the premise that servers were not reporting their tips and not paying taxes on them.  

So.... how do you get people to stop tipping after it's no longer necessary.  Otherwise you just go back to the same problem of people getting tax free income. 




 That was like 12 hours and everyone came back cause voat sucks  




 Those aren't dicks... this is eggplant beer.   




 Did you jokers not even read the link he posted as the source?  

It already says this right at the top.  

An aerator serves the following purposes:
Prevent splashing

Shaping the water stream coming out of the faucet spout [clarification needed]

Water conservation and reduction in energy costs

Reducing faucet noise

To increase the perceived water pressure, (often used in homes with low water pressure)

  




 These sinks really aren't for washing hands.  They are supposed to be for cleaning foods; especially fish (after/during scraping scales off) and produce.   

Not really sure why they put this in the area where you wash hands.... 

 




 Look bowls have not reached vintage status yet....  




 Well to be fair... the entire empire was after solo and even they had a difficult time capturing him.   

He had to get fucked over by a friend to make it happen.  Han Solo is a smuggler... so escape and evade is kinda what he is at the core.. I mean.. he's the brass fucking ring when it comes to capturing. So I don't really fault boba for failing at that.   




 Immitation is the highest form of flattary.   




 I liked, in Star Wars, how all the props and costumes would have dings and scratches and other signs of wear and tear.  

When everything is shiny and in perfect condition it is easier to tell it is fake or made of plastic or whatever. 




 I have never been paid minimum wage for not making any tips.  I was a waiter for 6 years.

 




 I cannot substantiate these claims based on my experience. 

I travel the world on the regular and I get the shittiest service in the USA. Because the workers are stressed and it shows.   




 you're tipping the business by subsidizing the low wages they pay.


This makes me feel something inside.  I'm not sure if it's anger or what... 




 I lived off being a waiter for many years.  Yes I had big nights where I made hundreds....

I still would have taken regular pay over that.  

Because my landord doesn't take the "tips were shitty this month" excuse on late rent. 




 How would you get people to STOP tipping after such law is passed?  




 The smell: Is it fresh and cooking? 

Look at the cooks:  Are they clean?  

Thats it. 




If the food looks 2 hours old and the cook has more dirt on his clothes than the bottom of his shoes.... then it's a true hole in the wall.   




 Oh BOLLOCKS! 




 Ugh.... driving to a destination in Texas. 

"Finally we made it to Texas border WHOOHOOO"

 I'll warm up your side of the bed for when you're finished.   




 Fuck.... yeah. 




 How dare you make fools of us by reading out the names of our shit. 




 China. 

Or is it Japan?  




 THIS!  THAT'S MY PROBLEM!  I have been fighting messy writing for years and as I write more neatly, I realized how painful it was after just a page and then I got sloppy again.    I never realised it was because I am fighting myself. 




 To err is human.  
To Arr is pirate.   

I saw that written on the wall of a pizza place here in Manila. 




 Why don't you lefties learn how to write from right to left?    




 I agree except for the war part.   The president is Commander in Chief.  Congress still had to declare war as it did with both Iraq and Afghanistan.   

If the president orders an air strike for immediate response I don't think we should be opening impeachment.   

Commanders have always had a little leeway in their operational parameters without having the order to attack come from above.   We should not handcuff ourselves from immediate response.   I think our system for engaging in war is still okay.   


I'm not sure if you're one of those people that think all combat=war but as a combat vet I'd take issue with that.  Can't sit around waiting for Congress to bicker about declaring war whilst some group of people rape and murder or attempt to take over.   




 Do you think the volitile nature of modern politics would be capable of writing a constitution that stands for over 200 years and works as well as the first one? 




 That's true.   Like the prohibition and then it's undoing. 




 You know I never looked at it from this angle.  

I'd worry about not having a bill of rights.... but i can see where having a constitution has made a lot of aspects of modern day life more difficult.  It isn't clear any longer how the old constitution should be interprered and applied for the modern world.  Society, culture, and technology have changed so much.   

I like this... you pick option C out of A and B.     you're the man.  I never even considered simply not having it. 









 You are so FUCKING ignorant.   50 years ago there werent many institutions to check ones self into.   And they were more like torture than actual help.   


I'm turning off inbox replies.   You're so ridiculous dude!   Gotta be trolling.... 




 Yeah which would make your point moot.... so obviously you typed that without actually believing it.    I assumed you left out a word because it completely contradicts your original point that he should have done something about his illness.. 



HE FUCKING DID 

 




 If you actually read about him it turns out he did ask for help.  But 50 years ago was the dark ages for mental health care.   Seriously consisting of techniques like blood letting, electric shocks, and shoving spikes into the patients brain....

I'm done here.   




 Bro... when are you going to stop demanding that an unhealthy irrational mind should function like a healthy rational mind?


You need to check yourself in..... 




 It wasn't an option because he wasn't capable of making the decision.   Good Mental health care was pretty much non existing existing at that time.  


Stop talking now.   You don't know what you're talking about. 




 So... you know how many sick people do that and still don't get help?  Writing does not equal the capacity to make a decision to check yourself into a place that has reputation of torture. Insane Asylums at that time are a place you didn't want to be.

Keep talking and embarrassing yourself by displaying a deeply flowing ignorance. 




 Especially during his time.    Holy cap!    




 What?   You clearly don't know anything about mental health.    Obviously a mind that is broken is not going to have rational thoughts like " maybe I should go to an institution".  


Also the insane asylum during this time was not a place you want to go.   




 Makes you wonder how many people we kill in execution that may have a health problem effecting their choices.   




 Plus the **GENUINE HORN W/KILL PHOTOS** will pull a higher price.    




 No... it'll be a selling point.  

"Genuine Horn" with photos of the kill... .people will pay MORE for it than they do now.   




 Yeah but they were all in a coma. That's how it stays plausible.
