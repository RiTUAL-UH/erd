 Yeah, but the show has already deviated from the books (and I expect this to get even more pronounced as Season 5 develops). Ain't no going back now.  




  the therapist would have to report you to authorities

If that's true then it's terrifying - and infuriating, because such a law would keep many pedophiles from seeking help, thus directly endangering children! 




 I agree. I don't believe that he can be faulted for having such desires (after all, you don't get to choose your sexuality) but his unwillingness to seek help for it is a red flag for me. If you have pedophilic tendencies you represent a danger to other people, no matter how well you think you have it "under control".   




 Well ain't you just a ray of ~~thinly veiled rage issues~~ sunshine.  




 Speaking as a European (from a country that is basically being worshipped by U.S. pro-gun people, mostly for inaccurate reasons) if limited magazine size is your biggest gripe with a candidate for the presidency you oughta be jumping for joy... 




 I just downloaded his thesis and flipped through it, curious about the writing style. The first thing I noticed? The dedication:

In the hopes that this work may in some way contribute
to their exploration of space, this is dedicated to the crew
members of this country' s present and future manned space
programs. If only I could join them in their exciting endeavors.


Made my day!

 




 Where did she say that?

She was talking about 23 year old men who *pursue sexual relationships with underage girls*, not all 23 year old men. That's a pretty big difference! 




 You can resign from the council. Voila! 




 What's safe or unsafe about any of us? Are you asking because you think that white men *specifically* are less 'unsafe' than other groups of the population or because you don't understand / disagree with the concept of a safe space?

I'll give you an example: Twice a month me and a whole bunch of my male friends get together for an evening - no women allowed. Activities differ - we might go for a hike or play some b-ball or go see a movie or have ourselves a good, old-fashioned N64 multiplayer-party. Usually there's copious amounts of drinking involved as well. We always have a great time.

And always, at some point in the evening, we start talking for real. Discussions that we can't have (or can't have in that way) with our girlfriends (and in the case of two of my mates, boyfriends). We talk about issues in our relationships, our careers, our physical and mental health and we all get a lot out of these talks. Because sometimes it's just nice to get some feedback on your issues from people who have similar experiences without having your partners involved.

That's an example of a safe space. Don't you see the value in that?  




 Yeah, I gotta agree. 

Hey i made as many as of you hosts so please invite loads of BME women and non-binary people!!

Also if you've been invited and you're a man and/or white PLEASE DON'T COME just cos I invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a BME Women and non-binary event only... Don't worry lads we will give you and allies things to do ;-)

I think that post is silly but I also think the word "ban" is hyperbole. Safe spaces can be useful tools - just think of women's or men's shelters, support groups for addictions or illnesses(Damn you Marla Singer)).  




 I remember reading research about incidences of anorexia suddenly sky-rocketing in developing countries when their TV stations started broadcasting western programming (I want to say sitcoms but I'm not sure) for the first time that depicted thinness as an attractive trait. If you're interested I can try and find it as soon as I'm not on mobile anymore.

In general I think that people who don't believe that we're influenced by the media are the same sort of people who claim that "ads don't work" on them...

 




 Have you ever heard Hitler use his "normal" voice? [It's a pretty interesting difference!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClR9tcpKZec) 




 Twenty bucks says she's Mossad.
