 That block on the Forte run was responsible for 6 points as well, don't forget that! 




 Both in OT, that much I know. 




 [I like seeing an angry Martellus](http://dallascowboysdishingthereal.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/bennett-bentley1.jpg) 




 He WAS the reason why the Bears went 13-3 back in 2001. I remember more than one game-changing interception return from Brown during this season. Talk about a guy that brought such intensity every week, going all-out is why he had so many injuries, and when he would get injured you could see how much it frustrated him to be on the sidelines. We miss you, Mike Brown. '

Edit: Confirmed info: Brown had two walk-off interception returns for TDs during the 2001 season. 




 Why did you have to bring up 2004 Cubs? Haven't watched baseball since. 




 [This McLaren?](http://imgur.com/a/IAfoX) That guy actually was parked in front of a pizza place the other night, so from your husband's directions that'd put you in Alexandria. 




 TIL the Acura NSX has a spare tire under the hood. 




 If you're listening on WBBM: Every time Tom Thayer says "Unbelievable!" 




 I think you may have really high hopes for Greg, but it makes sense that he'd be Cam's next guy to throw to after S.Smith. Plus, I sort of hate Eli Manning after last year's inconsistencies.  




  Picking Charles at #7... I'm happy to say that I was able to do the same, shocking as it may be. 




 If I remember correctly, there was a model called the VL that was lower. It had a 2.0L instead of the 2.2L in the RS. Also, it was missing those badass white wheels, and Rally Sport trim. 




 1991 Chevy [Cavalier RS](http://carphotos.cardomain.com/ride_images/1/3093/1221/7730610002_large.jpg) Owned this car in high school/freshman year of college, and actually drove it from 2005 to 2007; which is shocking, because today it is one of the most egregious vehicles that I have ever seen let alone owned. 

The car was sort-of white and featured electric blue and black trim along each bumper and exterior door panel. Giant electric blue and black letters saying "CAVALIER RS" bedecked the driver doors. The Rally Sport edition that also had painted-white metal wheels. Mine was literally falling apart. Any parking lot where I closed my door was sprinkled with rusty dust. 

Then, literally everything on the car broke. Someone slammed into the driver's door in high school, so that didn't open. The power locks broke, so I was forced to climb through the trunk should I decide to lock the doors that actually worked. No A/C. No Heat. I came out of class one day to notice that the exhaust system had literally snapped in half, and  I dragged the pipe down the street going a top speed of 30mph with my gas pedal to the floor. 

The good news? I sold it for $100 in '07.

TLDR: The 1991 Cavalier RS is an incredibly shitty automobile.  




 But... these shirts were on clearance. 




 So, this is in Mexico? 




 It's a fantastic looking car. However, keep looking for someone willing to fall in love with it if you want top dollar. Despite the car being out of production, there seem to be plenty of them in the used market; I don't think you will get a ton of calls if you're pricing it over $20,000.   




 Comparable GTOs are going for ~$20K. Have you got a picture? If not how externally modified is it?   




 I saw this thing in Old Town Alexandria, VA about 3 weeks ago; nearly everyone on the street stopped to look at it!
 




 Actually we did forget Cam Barker, intentionally. 




 A nice tribute to the nineties at least with the Dodge Shadow grille   Animaniacs touches... Let me go off on a tangent and say that was a truly great show. 




 [Here are a couple options through DC social sports.](http://dcsocialsports.com/leagues/soccer?state=LIVE locationId=) The co-ed league is more at the recreational level. (Although the teams I have played for had some really great females on them). The men's league is much more competitive. We play at the Long Bridge Park soccer fields, they are synthetic turf, and lighted for night games. Plus, the league usually has a bar component where everyone goes out and drinks post-game. 




 Will do; thanks for the resource! 




 I have been offered a position to teach middle school social studies in DC. After just speaking with my principal in passing, she said that she would like to sit down with me and discuss the "scope and sequence" for the 7th   8th Grade social studies curriculum next year. From my research, I'm picturing that this is a long term, big-picture framework for district wide lesson planning. However, she mentioned that she was not satisfied with the last social studies teacher's "scope and sequence." Which makes me believe that I may have to do some collaborating with her to make the overall, big-picture framework. 

Of course, when I sit down with her I would like to appear like I know what I'm talking about. So, if those of you out there in r/historyteachers-land could give me some information on what I can expect to talk to her about I'd greatly appreciate it! I have seemed very confident in my interactions with her thusfar, but she is a bit intimidating (Columbia Teachers' College grad, and also a big history nerd). Just trying to avoid being sent to the social studies teachers' graveyard like the last guy. 

[This is the only example I was able to locate online](http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/Files/downloads/In-the-Classroom/How-Students-Are-Assessed/Grade%207%20ELA%20SAS%20SY13-14.pdf)    

Thanks!  




 Also, that Focus is very fun to drive. I had to drive a friend of mine home once in a Focus hatch from this era, and I was very impressed with its pickup and handling. Probably had all the same features as yours, but she had hers shipped here from the Netherlands, so it gave it an extra cool factor. One of the most fun cars I've driven for sure. 




 It is a rare rear-wheel drive beast. However, this guy had [the last of the Grand Prix GXPs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pontiac_Grand_Prix_GXP_.jpg) 




 Just found this! [It's never too late, man](http://www.recycler.com/details/24681296) 




 Not necessarily stupid though, more of a sad trade-off. The area I moved to last winter made driving my Pontiac far too laborious. I got a "smarter" car that saves me money on both fuel and VA requirements. However, it lacks the special feel of driving the Pontiac. 

I was going through a quarter tank of gas every day working in DC, and then I find out that Northern VA has a 24-point inspection for road safety. (My driver's door didn't shut properly   power windows didn't work among some other issues with the power steering) All in all, I sold it in MD for $4000 in exchange for a friendlier DC driver (the Elantra). 

In summary, we aren't making "stupid" decisions, just dealing with the reality of the increasingly Pontiac-less motoring world of today.  




 your rant is completely justified. I can't even tell you how many people had the same criticism of GM about the frankly dumbass choice of preserving Buick. The consumers need to let their voice be heard. Time to put the soulless division of Buick to sleep and resurrect the excitement that was Pontiac!!!!!!
 




 I feel you. I had a Grand Am GT Coupe that I bought when I was 19, and I just let it go this past February. Let's not credit Pontiac for making the best quality cars; but Pontiacs did inspire a certain feeling for those who owned them. It was certainly a car that I was excited to drive.  




 let's hope. Front end looks majorly improved. 




 $33, not too big of a deal  




 Well put. Although, I wish all my neighbors their just reward for not being a great resident of Alexandria like myself.  




 Yeah. Plus, it isn't very much anyway. I've paid 3 times as much for "city-stickers" before. Guess I should have made the association that city-sticker=a source to generate revenue for the local gov't (aka TAX). Initially, I was taken aback back by the term "vehicle property tax."
 




 I've been in Alexandria for about six months now, but after buying a car in FL, and then switching over to VA license and registration I have paid the "vehicle property tax" and posted the sticker on my car as proof. 

Here's the thing, less than half the cars in my neighborhood have City of Alexandria stickers on them. I'm noticing that a number of the ones that do have stickers also have out-of-date ones. Is the vehicle property tax just something that isn't really enforced in AVA? And am I a sucker for even paying it?  




 I'm calling an ugly one by Shaw ending it. 




 some of us might remember john scott's being longer 




 "so big and long" -pierre
 




 Just Game 1...buckle up. 




 Thought you had the lead? Oduya now? 




 Shaw has impressed in this game, he's due for one of his own. 




 Join DC Social Sports 




 Classic Kane. When they were coming into the league those radio commercials with Toews and him were painful and hilarious at the same time. 




 Not sure I'm feeling that Camaro he's driving. 




 Listen to John Wiedeman and Troy Murray online on WGN radio. These guys are hands down the best as far as intensity, analysis, and general passion for the Hawks goes. I live in Washington DC and try to blast the volume on these guys whenever possible... although it makes me long for my hometown. 




 [Wiedeman   Murray!](http://tv.trb.com/extras/wgnam/player/listen.htm)
 




 [This is a great looking car.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mazda3MPS.JPG) Probably an overall better choice from a financial standpoint + I really like the front end on this generation better. 




 Got to love that Q has him back on the wing; Center was not a great fit.
 




 I'm looking at Kane to score more goals than last year despite the abbreviated season
 




 Unfortunately, I didn't get to experience the concept of the "two hour delays" that can happen here in the schools that I work in. (I would assume more snowfall needed.) The reactions are certainly different than the midwest; I remember having to walk to high school with 16 inches of snow on the ground in Chicago. I think my school had one snow day every 40 years. 




 Just moved here 1 month ago from Chicago. The top two things I miss are: 
1. The Blackhawks
2. Being able to order Giardiniera on things

I'm not about to jump on board with the Caps, though. I think we'll be lucky to see 5-6 Hawks games on local tv in DC this year. Such a shame, because this team is going to tear it up this year. 




 Got to love that car. Is that a Ford Aspire, Donovan?
 




 Raffi Torres for sure. 




 What about the [Dodge Daytona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Daytonashelbyz.jpg)? It looks like it was built on the same platform as the Starion; much like the Mitsubishi Mirage was to the Dodge Colt. 
 




 Hondas and Toyotas have the best reputation for reliability; however, in your price range you can expect six-digit odometer numbers. I think that you may be able to find an Elantra with 60-70K miles on it.   




 Yep. Darryl Drake. 




 So what's up with Shaw then, just 1 goal on the season so far?  




 Thank you. From what I read in a guide to teacher certification reciprocity, it seemed that 3 years experience was almost a requirement to have my certificate recognized in MD.  




 Thanks! This is very helpful, I haven't really sought out the charter school opportunities in Chicago too enthusiastically, but I'm probably better equipped to take on those challenges now than I was a year ago. I'll definitely investigate. Any insight that your wife could provide would be greatly appreciated.

 Please tell me what is the job market for teachers like in the metropolitan area? 

I am moving here next month from Chicago as part of a project that my current employer is doing. However, I'm a certified teacher and haven't gotten a classroom in IL due to an insane disparity between many applicants and very few openings. (not to mention widespread district cutbacks, etc.) I'd love to teach in DC or northern VA. 

So redditor-educators of DC, what type of climate should I expect? Are there any districts that you know of that I should target? Do you know of any paraprofessional/teaching-aide positions that may be opening up in the near future? I'd love to get my foot in the door, and would be open to ditching my employer to make a positive step in obtaining my goal of teaching in the classroom. 

Any suggestions or advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks!!   




 That has got to be Wal-Mart. 




 Soccer fans are ok with it, because the result is 45 minutes of continuous play uninterrupted by commercials.
