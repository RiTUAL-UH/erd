 add sci-fi stuff to swords axes and other old weapons
i thought mini thruster behind the blade to propel it and a retractable chain mechanism on the handle to the wrist of the user in case it's dropped

without going into the most seen things such as laser blades and such.
i don't care if they wouldn't be used because blah blah guns blah
 




 that's a very low power abilty more fit to be a trait of your character
think weirder and bigger. 




 Outcome: "You're knocked over, your action is interrupted and your face smarts."
This anime-inspired gift is a nigh-unblockable technique to inflict mild pain upon ones opponent and interrupt whatever mundane action they're performing at the time.
At One-trick Utility, this particular version can activate only in response to an offense to the user (insult or attack to user or people they care about).
Given that, however, the user is free to describe different methods of attack (slap, giant hammer, high kick, high-velocity football, etc) that all do the same thing.

If a Noble with this Gift messes up or does something really embarrassing, then it erases the memories of everyone who saw him foul up. It won't actually undo any of the physical consequences of his mistake, but it'll make sure no one rubs it in his face. Note that because this Gift is limited to local range, it won't help if the Noble's screw-up is somehow broadcast to other people, like over television or radio.

A Noble with the Seven League Step can cross extremely long distances in a matter of seconds! Each use of this Gift lets him cover about ten miles of distance as he runs as superhumanly fast speeds. This is way faster than the speed of sound, so this might cause a sonic boom if you're in a place where stuff like that happens.

This Gift, designed for the Power sworn not to kill, causes their actions never to kill anybody, no matter what. In fact, it becomes more or less impossible for anyone in the Power's presence to die other than of natural causes, unless a miracle is used with the specific intent to kill. Otherwise, regardless of the level of collateral damage, everybody lands safely in a dumpster, or is shot in the arm, or can be thawed out later with no lasting effects.

If you want the mechanical rules i can also post that. 




 Traveller i hear is pretty complex and yet it's one of the most beloved games. 




 to put it simply the players play as incarnation of reality , a piece of it, whatever the players want they can have as their estate ,fire,libraries,lakes,cats with green eyes, that feeling when you heard a sound while listening to music, etc

and to that comes the fun for the gm, atleast for me, it seems it's one of the few games where the Gm is actually playing and not just being an engine so the others have fun, more on that in a bit.

the players are a family bound by the same imperator and reside in the chancel their duty is to protect their aspect of reality and the chancel and nothing else, atleast it should be that way but Nobles (the beings you play) are most emotional beings and have their drives so that means feuding in some cases (which can be great fun, stealing Fate's collection of profecyzing toad pets and use them to predict what good shows are coming on tv in the future and which one suck)

Nobles are very hard to kill, straight up combat between nobles is frowned upon and seen as barbaric, backstabbing and other less flashy kind of attacks are prefered, keep in mind Nobles are EXTREMELY hard to kill, it CAN be done but you have to REALLY want to kill that dude (if he's mortal, immortality is a measly 6 poins) by ye old way of kicking but, be smart and use your estate and less "direct" ways (Such as Domain and Person) to inflict damage

ruin their name, destroy things that belong to their estates, The Noble of Oceans would be greatly weakened if somone happened to drink the mediterranean (aspect 8 miracle)

 




 Oh please yes Nobilis is my favorite game it's just unique. 




 Gurps is what comes to mind if we're talking about complex but playable if you want so complex that it's like calculus in college level of complex the unholy trinity has something for you. 




 Nobilis is a diceless system where you play an incarnation of piece of reality ranging from Thunder,Lakes,Sight to cats-that-have-green-eyes. and have total control over it.

"Gifts are the "skills" in Nobilis. They work pretty much like miracles with one exception. Miracles are flexible and mutable. They can adapt to any situation as deemed so. Gifts cannot.

A gift is "purchased" at character creation and it can be used by a character any time they deem necessary without any need to expend Miracle Points. A single gift can do anything, from a single task to several of them separately, only imagination and the HGs judgment limits it's creation."

show me your creativity.
