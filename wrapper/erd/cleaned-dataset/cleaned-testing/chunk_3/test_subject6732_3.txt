 :) :) Not high.. That response was just a thought.. Although all proverbs are not metaphors.. some damn certainly are! 




 *The Brief History of Time* by Stephen Hawking - fits your specs of scientific non-fiction.. That being said, there are great books in non-ficiton domain. Try exploring books that are outside the apparent science genre because when you look keenly, everything has science at its heart. 

Books by :

* Malcolm Gladwell, Nassim Nicholas Taleb (fall under Social Science)
* Michael Lewis, Tim Harford  ( fall under Financial Science)

are very insightful.

And then:

* Isaac Asimov (if you ever find any non-ficiton book by this person, devour it without second thought, he's that good.)
* try reading biographies of remarkable people.. I loved Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson
* Walden by Henry David Thoreau   Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer
* A must read novel: *Flatland* by Edwin A. Abbot
* The Flipside by Adam J. Jackson

These are some of my recommendations for now, just to make you get used to reading interesting stuff.. and once you do that you will automatically start finding books on your own! 




  don't take Chinese proverbs literally. Same goes for any language proverbs.

True. Proverbs, in their deepest sense, are merely brilliant metaphors. 




  no, it seems OP did not make it up

:) You're right.. I did not. 




 Harry Potter's magical world! 




 I experience this whenever I stay away from reading for more than a couple of days. Something seems missing in my daily life when I do that. And this quote seemed very appropriate for this sub where *reading* is a part of our lives... So I just thought we should see this.

EDIT: This post made some people feel like we are looking down upon non-readers.. No. We are not.. And this quote doesn't share even the least bit of such intentions. *Reading is about knowledge, but it is no real knowledge if it doesn't tell you how to treat people that are different from you in ways that you feel are vital for a person's ethos.* I offer my apologies to all those who felt hurt by a few number of comments that some people (may be even me) posted here. We sincerely don't mean to hurt anybody ever in the matters of book reading.. **May be we kid sometimes, here and there, but we are all a brotherhood here!** 

Thanks, everyone :) 




 I guess you took this quote right out of Austin Kleon's blog... Worthy quote, though! 




 IN 2014:

* I STARTED MY JOB CAREER. MOVED TO A FAVOURITE CITY OF MINE, PUNE, INDIA.
* I TOOK UP [R/NOFAP](http://www.reddit.com/r/nofap) CHALLENGE ON REDDIT FOR 131 DAYS IN A ROW WITHOUT A SINGLE REPALSE.
* I [FINISHED READING 25 BOOKS](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2qoi2p/im_24_now_i_was_free_much_of_2013_and_id_read_36/).
* I GAINED AWESOME FRIENDS AT MY COMPANY DURING THE TRAINING PERIOD.
* I'M A BLOGGER. I WROTE GOOD STUFF THIS YEAR.
* IN NOVEMBER, I TOOK UP A WRITING CHALLENGE FOR MYSELF AND WROTE MORETHAN 13 THOUSAND WORDS IN 21 DAYS. (EVERYDAY HAS A MINIMUM OF 500 WORDS IN ITS NAME FOR 21 DAYS AT A STRETCH.. I'M A NON-NATIVE IN ENGLISH.. LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE, I'M FROM INDIA..)
* WITH THE PUSH THAT WRITING CHALLENGE HAD GIVEN ME, I STARTED WRITING FLASH-FICITON FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE MY FICTION WRITING SKILL. (I WANT TO BECOME AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE NOVELIST!)
* DECIDED NOT TO TAKE UP ANY, SO CALLED, 'NEW YEAR RESOLUTIONS' FOR 2015.


BUT THAT'S ALL IN THE PAST.... NOW IT IS ANOTHER YEAR, MOTHERFUCKERS. SO LET'S GOD DAMN BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE **NOW** PART.
 




  MAJOR FUCKING NATIONAL EXAM NEXT YEAR

I WISH YOU ALL THE VERY BEST WITH ALL MY HEART FOR YOUR EXAM THIS YEAR.  




   UNSTOPPABLE MAGMA-BLOODED RHINO

THAT IS JUST FUCKING WELL PUT. 




 Awesome post, pal.. Thanks for posting... It's very inspiring....  especially the below line:

 It is time to take that pain, that agony and use it to build from here.

I've my things lined up for this year, which actually started in December 2014, and that was a very apt line for me to remember. Thanks :) 




 The Wiki link is obvious... but I'm more interested in personal opinions and experiences of people here.. Thank you though :) 




 Nah :) 




 awesome... if you do any such ones plz do post the links here in the comments.. because I'm saving this post already :) 









 Hey, high five.. Same problem with me as well.. I suck at writing dialogue. And I was already skinned alive on r/destructivereaders for that. 




 Haha :) :) That would serve a great purpose indeed :) 




 Yeah.. Simple as that.. 

Read. Stop. Repeat. 




 ok.. after moving to Pune in March of 2014, I had been to a book sale where they were selling books by weight.. 1 KG for (just) Rs.100/-

I bought 23 books for (just) Rs.570/-

That's the best buy, not just of 2014, but of my life till date :) 




 Honestly, my best buy of the year relating to books is the Rs. 1100/- broadband internet connection.. *(If you know what I mean!)* 




 I've always had this doubt since I read *Gitanjali* by Rabindranath Tagore, him being the first author I read that was awarded Nobel in Literature.. and then I went on to read Ernest Hemingway's *Old Man And The Sea* and John Steinbeck's *Of Mice And Men*... 

I loved *Gitanjali*, liked *Of Mice and Men* and disliked *Old Man and the Sea*.. 

I thought it's time I clarify to myself about how Nobels are awarded in Literature category. So, here I am asking about it. Please shed some light. Thanks :) 




 I can't suggest you any books but I am surely taking some titles out of your list as suggestions for me.. Thanks :) 




 Hey very informative reply, pal....  




 And I just love this thread :) 




  The Alchemist. No matter how meandering the path, the journey is worth it.

This book is a part of my life..  




 Although I like your determination and all, it's a serious way to turn reading as a chore than as a pleasing hobby.. Reading is a blessing, and don't count your blessings word by word, pal, counting them by books and their respective pages is enough already.. But that's just me :) 




  there's so much to be read! 

Yes.. there's so much to be read.... It's like a Universe in itself.. There is always very much more to know of :) 




 Oh.. roger that :) 




  One per week. 

Awesome.. All the very best and Happy New Year :) 




 This isn't even a bit about Hindu mystic bullshit.. or for that matter any religious bullshit... It's solely about my own mystic mind's bullshit. Simple as that, buddy :) 




 Sorry, although I've a Masters in Computer Applications, I don't like the idea of algorithms telling me what to read next. I would like to leave that duty to the destiny.

But thanks for sharing the link here, there are people who prefer to believe in digitized life than in a destined one.. they would love the link, I guess. So, here is my upvote for the post :) 




 The main thing that drove me and still drives me towards reading more books is *I'm an aspiring writer*.. and to write better you gotta read better and read like hell... So once I tried to take up writing seriously, and as they say *when you pick up one end of the stick you pick up the other end too..*, I had to take reading seriously as well... and that lead me through myriad portals toward the kind of stuff I'm interested to read/write about.. and I kept picking up books.. 

So, that's the most important thing about forming my reading habit.. and also another vital aspect is I was gifted a *Kindle Paperwhite* by my brother-in-law for my birthday around July 2013, and thence my reading habit got redefined :)

And coming to the part of feeling reading as a *chore*: I've a weakness in my mind.. that is when I start reading a book and if I don't feel interested in it or if it felt tough or anything, I simply cannot give up reading it.. I feel defeated by that book when I do that.. I somehow continue it till I end it.. So during such times, yes, reading feels like a chore... In the list I mention in the post, the books that especaily felt like that were: *The Loser* by Peter Ustinov and *Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by R. L. Stevenson* (I'm trying to fight this weakness, which would help me save time and makes reading not to feel like a chore, at times..)

Rest all were fine, but I obviously didn't like all the books equally... 

So, that's about it :)

Thank you so much for the interest you showed in asking me about my habit forming.. 




 Roger that.. Thank you for the correction.. Will remember when I use it next time :) 




 I was just like you till a couple of years ago... Maybe you too would pick up the reading habit soon.. Good Luck.. Happy New Year :) 




 good resolution.. 




 I'm thinking to name 2015 as *my year of short-stories*.. I'm an aspiring writer, and I recently started to write flash fiction to practice my fiction writing abilities.. So, I'm thinking to read lots of short stories in 2015.. atleast 100 short stories. 




 I got recruited from my campus (NIT Kurukshetra, India) in the March of 2013 itself while I was in the final semester of my Masters.. but the joning date didn't turn up till the March of 2014.. meanwhile I picked up reading books all along that waiting period.. and also a bit freelance writing.. I'm a blogger, too. 




 yeah I love non-fiction.. especially the ones that talk about technology, economics, science, and ofcourse biographies... among the list the non-ficition books I read this year are *Next* by Micheal Lewis, *The Accidental Billionaires* by Ben Mezrich, *The Undercover Economist* by Tim Harford, *The Tipping Point* by Malcolm Gladwell, *Tuesdays with Morrie* by Mitch Albom... I loved each of them.. and among biographies, last year I read and **loved** *Into The Wild* and *Walden* (although not a bio) and another technology book about Big Data.. and I also started *Steve Jobs* by Walter Isaacson but did not finish it as I didn't carry the book with me later... But i loved whatever I read from it.

 The non-fiction book that I'm currently reading is *Representative Men* by Ralph Waldo Emerson.. and I plan to pick up *The Information* by James Gleick in 2015 :)

Non-fiction is almost always awesome :) 




 Finally, finished the book... and also took help of *Sparknotes* to understand it better... Thanks, guys :) 




 Thank you :) 




 Thanks :) 




 I know they're not great numbers compared to what people here usaually hold.. But still, I did fine for where I came from..  I'm a non-native in English, (from India), so I slowly picked up the habit of reading books, and now they're an integral part of my life. Books mean a lot to me. My dream is to become an English language novelist. So, I look forward to develop my reading habits and abilities to a great extent in the future.

The list of the 25 books that I've finished in 2014 are:

* *The Great Gatsby* by F. Scott Fitzgerald 
* *The Man Who Japed* by Philip K Dick  
* *The Accidental Billionaires* by Ben Mezrich 
* *Tuesdays with Morrie* by Mitch Albom 
* *Siddhartha* by Herman Hesse 
* *The Doomsday Conspiracy* by Sidney Sheldon 
* *The Illusions* by Richard Bach 
* *The Flipside* by Adam J Jackson
* *Animal Farm* by George Orwell
* *Saving Faith* by David Baldacci 
* *The Loser* by Peter Ustinov 
* *The Undercover Economist* by Tim Harford 
* *The Tipping Point* by Malcolm Gladwell 
* *Screw It, Lets Do It* by Richard Branson 
* *Flatland* by Edwin A. Abbott 
* *1984* by George Orwell 
* *Prey* by Michael Crichton 
* *The Giver* by Lois Lowry 
* *Out of My Head* ( also published as *Unknown*) by Didier Van Cauwelaert

 and also an essay called *Walking* by Henry David Thoreau

Thank you r/books, for being such an awesome sub and for putting lots and lots of new books into my life.. You guys rock :) 




 The fuck bro.. It's awesome :D.. Thank you so much..
I was fucking surprised there are no comments on this post yet.... That's very mean :(

Especially the awesomest thing is that the videoscreen has the name of the track playing... Fuckin perfection, pal :)) 




 Dude, come on.. that was Mark Twain... not from Michel-whatever-his-name-was! 




 This is SOMETHING! 




 awesome 




 Hey, it's not Ghandi.. It's Gandhi.. Sorry, pal, we Indians take this seriously.. 




 I absolutely loved them though.. I was asking this only out of curiosity :) 




 BATMAN. 




 Here is the track that I was talking about from Predestination film.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=599vpKbNEek

This is such an intriguing track.. I would like to know more of such tracks. 
Please help.. Thanks :) 




  Jon Krakauer
 
 Malcom Gladwell

*Into The Wild* by Jon Krakauer is a part of my life now.. and so is *Outliers* by Mr. Gladwell.. awesome non-ficiton writers both of them... 




 Malcolm Gladwell and Michael Lewis. 




 *On Photography* by Susan Sontag 




 The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, of course.. But I think you must've already read it.. Sorry, if so. 




 Ok.. thanks for encouraging, pal.. I will continue it :) 




 HEy, thanks for the list... :) 




 I thought that it is such a small book and a classic, too, so I felt happy to pick it up, but, boy, I was so very wrong.. The book is literally unreadable for me :( 

(I'm not native English.. )

Is it only me or is there anybody else out there who felt similar difficulty?? 

Robert L. Stevenson, why would you do something like that, sir?? I loved your *Treasure Island!* It was such a nice read.. 




 Great and true advice :) Thanks for reminding us to do what is necessary. 




 * Opening paragraph was well engaging. 
* Second paragraph was tough to read and sounded very confusing.
* Third slowly seemed to be losing direction.

Ok, now I better probably stop pointing out para wise.. All paragraphs can and should be improved for easy readability and visualization. 

Now, there are for sure very good lines from the letter:

 What are words, but dancers upon a page? 

Awesome opening line.

 the way you stabbed them with your tongue.

Very well put sentence.

 And this letter will never meet your lips.

I didn't get if the narrator was expecting the letter to be kissed (*meet the lips?*) or just be read (done by lips as well). If you meant 'to be read' this line can be better put as: *And this letter will never flow through your lips.*  or better: *And this letter will never flow through your lips and into your heart.*

And one more thing about my critique.. If my words hurt your feelings, don't take me seriously... Keep up the good work and do awesome writing as always.

[As you mentioned that you wrote this piece over a year ago, and as it is usually said that you need a good amount of time between you *write* something and you come back to edit or *re-work* on it... I guess you just didn't look into it after that year's time, and directly posted here without reworking upon it. It's visible, the *first-draftness* in the writing] 




 Awesome Christmas Tree :D :D 




 I liked Bradbury's *Fahrenheit 451*.. What an idea it holds!! Amazing concept. By the way, what's the name of the short story collection of his that you're reading? 




 Can yo please share with me what you loved about *The Old Man and The Sea*?? Why am asking is I'm new to reading classic books, and I didn't enjoy this book much.. So I want to know what made people love it, so that I can read such books with that mindset next time when I pick up some. 




  The Old Man and the Sea
 
 The Great Gatsby

I've read these both... They felt ok... Good ones.. Gatsby book was way better than the other, though. 




 First of all, I was expecting great story from the book because of all the hype of it being a classic and all.... and most importantly due to the depressive environment the entire book had bestowed upon me (I must say, in this case the author succeeded in making me feel the Dystopian time completely.. Orwell did great work at that)... So, I guess, I disliked the book mostly because I was expecting lot of great thrilling story from it rather than focusing on the classic idea of privacy invasion.. so that's the reason. My bad. 




  Nobody aint denied nothing

Oh that just tripled.. LOL :P 




 Herman Hesse is good too.. His Siddhartha was very intriguing.. Thanks, shall try Steppenwolf as well. 




 Steinbeck is no doubt great.. In just over a 100 page novel he came up with such an engaging story of people.. I like this kind of small books that tell a lot.. I loved *Animal Farm* as well.. Suggest me some more small books that tell a lot, if you know of any. 




 I love *Animal Farm* but I dislike *1984*.. Sorry, can't help :( 




 The first edition of *Five Point Someone* by Chetan Bhagat. The inner page of the book cover has Chetan Bhagat's coolest picture on it. I love books with their Authors' full page picture in them.  




 Thoreau is great! Both in life and in text. 




 I'm from India, and I'll probably be downvoted to hell for asking this question:  *Why do Americans use a lot of double negatives?* Isn't that a wrong usage of the language? So, why would an English speaking country use it so much??


 




 I'm ridiculous at the things that I love... Can't help.. ;) 




 And you're talking as if it's a sin to do so! 




 Hey, 2014.. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for giving us this film. We will reminisce this experience all our lives. We will engrave *2014* in our hearts with golden letters, and probably sprikle some *star-dust* on it, too!

This year will remain a truly life changing period to many people, like myself, who saw *Interstellar* as more than just a film.

Thank you so much, 2014, for giving us such a cherishable conclusion for the year.  




  but serving in a greater sense.

Sure he is..
 




 What does the quote actually mean? 




 This was a very weird concept - comparing a person to a movie and the situations in it... but interesting as well... A new perspective :) 




 Hmm.. may be I will :) 




 No.. I like italics, that is all.. and why should italicised words mean disgust? Why did you think so? 




 In case you haven't gone through the below post today on r/writing, please do.. It's a great motivation for writing!

http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/2q0air/what_are_some_sentences_you_wish_you_wrote/ 




 Second of all, your post is going to give ideas and inspiration for many nbewbies like myself.. thanks again for that, mate :) 




 "Anything with the power to make you laugh over thirty years later isnt a waste of time. I think something like that is very close to immortality."

That's another Stephen King right there... from *Hearts In Atlantis* 




 You just suggested me a new book!  




 Hey, OP.. First of all let me thank you for coming up with such an awesome post.. Really refreshing and requiring for aspiring writers.. 




 That's one outstanding line. Now, I wish I wrote that! 




 I've never read Joyce. Was he referring to *semen,* in that sentence?  




 The first work I've read of Stephen King's is *Hearts In Atlantis* which is a collection of three novellas.. and I loved the storytelling in it.. Bobby's character as a young school kid in *Men In Yellow Coats* novella is written very well. I could almost relate him to me when I was a young kid myself.  




 Thanks, OP, for this post! 




 Why, indeed?  




 It wasn't pleasant to read... Too many neithers and nors, especially... And also a bit of hi-fi vocab here and there... Should've been easier, I guess.  




 fuckin' awesome! 




 This post also belongs in [r/Interstellar](http://www.reddit.com/r/interstellar/) I request you to please post it there as well. 
It's necessary.  




 This sounds like it is about *The Interview* film ban! 




 Awesome advancement...!!!  




 Do you realize that you just gave me a new idea for a book, or may be a short story. Thank you so much :) 




 May be we give it away by finding it out... 




 Anyways, in this scenario Interstellar helped me stop being a creep then. But still, isn't writing poetry artistic and not creepy??  




 A Gripping Glitch...  




 true that! 




 Ok. I will keep that in my mind.. But here in India, things work differently.. Anyways, I wrote that poetic piece not because I just wanted to give it to her, but solely because as an artist, a writer, I couldn't hold back the explosion of feelings in my heart whenever I looked at her or thought about her. 




 Creepy?? Since when is expressing your love for a girl in poetic form creepy? I thought it is artistic. 




 Acc to me, The Lost Symbol is the least impressive RL adventure. The recent one, Inferno, is way better than TLS. But *Angels and Demons* is his best ever work. 




 Dan Brown - Robert Langdon novels. 




 (This is all from India) A couple of months ago I started liking a girl in my office.. She is a very beautiful girl.

 I'm a writer by hobby, and the beauty of that girl made me pen some lines about her. I wrote a poetic piece, titled as [Her](https://medium.com/@krishna_mydream/her-c95a39117644) and I gave it to her. I don't know if she even read it or not. I tried a few times to talk to her in person after showing her that poetry, but she straight away refused so talk to me. 

This whole incident had toubled me for weeks, my mind was occupied by her thoughts.. and then one fine day, November 8th, I watched the most awaited movie, *Interstellar* - and that's it.. The chains of that girl's beauty that had imprisoned my mind all along this time could not hold me back any longer, and they freed me.

 The grandeur of the cosmic tale told in the film had made my mind to wash away many trivial troubling things of my life, among which is my liking towards that girl. 

I'm an aspiring writer. After witnessing the mind bending brilliance of Interstellar, I realized that I had better things to do in my life than to sit back and feel bad for a rejection. 

Interstellar really expanded the horizons for my exploration of stories. Now, standing in front of the enigmatic journeys into the tales of wonders of the Unvierse I can voyage into, worrying about a girl seem merely unworthy of my mind's thought process.

Thank you so much for all this, *Interstellar* :) 




 First, simply put *Walden* is called an *American* classic because it is a classic work written by an american (I'm an Indian, by the way). 

And second, it is definitely a classic book, no questions asked. In *Walden* Thoreau's insights about where the Mankind is going in the matters of human character and environmental love, the two things that are put into each of us from the moment we take birth, are nothing less than astounding. There are many instances in the book that are capable of making us feel embarrased for the way we're living on this planet, without worrying least bit about this eternal(?) home of ours. If there is one book that should be seen with no boundaries of country, it would surely be this. Hence, please don't call *Walden* a specific *country's* classic, rather call it a Mankind's classsic, which it is undoubtedly is. 




 *Eldorado* by Edgar Allan Poe  




 Hey thank you so much for the share :) :) 









 Yeah now i'm interested in Gillian Flynn... I will surely read her other books but I don't read same author multiple times in short spans of time, so I will wait...  




 I'm from India and the movie is not present here anymore.. so I'll just wait for the DVD/Bluray to come out.. You just saw the film, so I would suggest you to wait a while and then read it... because I guess one would not be able to read a book properly under the influence of its film, so try waiting till it wears off.. but that's just my thinking though ;) 




 I don't generally read this kind of fiction.. I'm usually into Thrillers, Sci-Fi, Non-Fiction.. But after knowing that the movie by David Fincher has done so well I thought of picking up the book before watching the film adaptation of it.. and it was an amazing experince over all.. The most interesting part about the book is that both male (Nick) and female (Amy) narrations are great.. The thing that most intrigued me is how well Amy character turned out as the story moved forward.. It evolved very powerfully. I loved it. 

 A 4/5 book for me in the recent days... Awesome :) :) 




 My thoguts exactly... I was spellbound realizing that perfection and be this perfect! 




 Thank you so much for the interest.. It's a simple breathing pattern/technique. But I'm afraid I won't be able to articulate the process and benefits of Sudharshana Kriya as much as the *The Art Of Living Foudation* does, the institution where I learned it from.. So, [here is the link](http://www.artofliving.org/in-en/what-sudarshan-kriya) to where you can get a glimpse of what the Kriya process is all about.. Whatever is explained in there, believe it or not, it sure did change my thought process a couple of years ago, and I'm a person who stronly believes that your thoughts make your life, hence I can happily say that it did bring a great change in my life. (And you can also find many videos of the Kriya process on the internet, in case if you wanna try learning it.)

Good Luck and Namaste :) 




 Brilliant piece :) :) Thanks for sharing.... 




 I loved the science and behind it and also Man's conflict with Nature.. especially the Chaos Theory part.. I absolutely love this book :) :) 




 thank you so much for reading it, pal... and special thanks if you decide to share it with others.. i'll be very thankful :) :) 




 interesting... good luck for whatever comes your way :)
I too just did a blog on what interstellar means to me, and posted [here](https://medium.com/@krishna_mydream/pursuing-your-passion-can-be-an-interstellar-journey-e61b49187aa9).. it's more of the uplifting blog types.. but your experience is a better and new one.. try giving it a read.. Thanks :) 









 Hey thanks for the info and the comment.. :) :) 




 Good that you posted it here.. Can somebody please explain the sentence in detail?? 




 Interesting!
