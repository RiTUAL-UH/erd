 It may be worth considering that you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. 




 So because you don't know a word I can't use it? The word existed long before I used it. 




 Do you have a question? 




 Is there a question? 




 My wife stacks her pills and doesn't deal with that  




 It's rarely relevant. Most people don't even know what it is and my preferred pronouns are obvious from my appearance, so there is no need to express such.  




 Not really a problem, but I appreciate your drunken concern. 




 Sorry, I was out car shopping.

I would say that in the sense that I experience dysphoric feelings, it's a disorder, though in the sense that something is "wrong" with me, I wouldn't. I learned in psychology in college that to be considered a mental illness, it has to cause negativity in your life. If you hear voices but they are encouraging and good, you're not mentally ill, despite the fact that it may be inconvenient. Based on that, while the dysphoric feelings suck, they don't in any way hinder my life, so no, I'm not experiencing a mental disorder or illness.

I don't know the cause. My "brain map" of my body isn't correct to what my body actually is. That seems like it's either psychological or body related. I don't much care how I'm perceived but I present more masculine, so that is a societal or environmental factor. 

I began identifying as genderqueer at around 14 or 15. I'm 20 now. I had a friend who came out as a transman and was doing research when I fell upon the term and it fit like a glove. I have memories from childhood that I call "signs I was trans". I can remember being 7 trying to make a prosthetic penis to pee through with a toilet paper roll. I can remember being about 9 and seeing an episode of SVU about transpeople and crying because I assumed by parents did that to me as a baby and couldn't just love me as the boy I was born as. I can remember praying for my period at 12 because I thought I would actually feel like a girl when I got it and it would prove that I was born one and was supposed to be one.  




 Yes, I have depression and anxiety. However, that has nothing to do with my gender identity. I have no other diagnosis so I won't claim any other.  




 http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer

http://gender.wikia.com/wiki/Transmasculine 




 Yes and no. One can simply identify as genderqueer, which is something of an umbrella term, and not wish to make any changes. I don't identify as 100% man 100% of the time, so I feel transman isn't fitting, but genderqueer is, however I am actually making an effort to transition just toward what exactly isn't quite defined. 

Edit: I'm the only female child in my family so female pronouns. I don't want to hurt my parents. 




 I read through his filmography on Wikipedia to answer your question, and, while I recognized many titles, I've never seen any. I don't really like movies, though. 




 It means that, while I don't wish to fully transition to being a man 100% of the time, I do wish to transition to being more masculine. The difference between this and simply being masculine is that I make changes, like binding my chest, to do so. I also will have my breasts removed eventually.  




 I think people should do whatever they want, provided it harms no one else. For me, I like having a label that I feel fits me. 

I've never seen anything with Bill Murray in it.  









 None of those subs are all that specific. Twox is only specifically about women and politics is only specifically about politics, based on name alone. /r/dicksprinkles is specific but not biased. 




 Got mine free on Facebook. The people were moving and needed to get rid of it, my wife and I wanted to upgrade from our full to a queen. It sits on a platform my dad and I built together and it's wonderful. 




 Consider adoption, if you and your wife can love an adopted baby the same way as a biological one. No shame if you can't, though, adoption isn't for everyone. My older brothers are both adopted since my parents "couldn't have kids" and they they had my younger brother and I biologically. It's great and I'm far closer to my adopted brother than my biological one. 




 I got one pair in 9th grade. They fell apart in less than six months.  




 You didn't bang a first time and objectification of OP isn't the way to get there anyway. 




 XI is 11. VI is 6. Just for future reference.  




 Wow... abusive much? Do you know anyone with PCOS and how there are various levels of seriousness of it and symptoms?  




 Go to church, pray in school, read the bible, etc. 




 Far the hell away from? 




 That's a line to get more than a handjob.  




 My mom got fired from selling Tupper Ware in the 80s because she got diagnosed with cancer and didn't have a party for three weeks. It was bullshit. 




 Mine has helped me a lot. He doesn't do anything questionable, either. He willingly sends people to orthopedic surgeons when needed. He performs x-rays and I have heard him tell people he can't help them. Most of my program included exercising the injured site, starting with passive stretching by a licensed massage therapist and then with help from a licensed personal trainer. He explains immediately in your first visit that he is not a medical doctor and if that makes you uncomfortable you are free to go elsewhere. My wife has PCOS and I speculated so for about six months. He met her once when she came with me and the next appointment he told me he thought she had it and that she needed to see a gynecological doctor immediately. He was right, obviously, and never tried to make me bring her for adjustments to help her. He stated that she needed hormonal treatment most likely in the form of birth control, which is right. I appreciate mine so much. He has been such a help in my life. 




 You went to a quack, that doesn't make all chiropractors quacks. Mine is great. He helped me with injuries from a car accident and has never pushed the herbal remedies he sells on me, just helps me with my back, as he is employed to do.  




 The point is that I disagree with something for my own arbitrary reasons. That doesn't mean I have to think other people can't do that thing.

Edit: the porn of little people I have seen looks like children and that freaks me out, if that's what you were asking. 




 I think that watching midget porn is gross and creepily close to childporn and wrong but others have the choice to do so. 




 But the pharmaceutical companies want their money and will do anything to harm you and your family to get it!!!!!!!!! 




 Uhm no. I'm a woman married to a woman. I am high libido, she is low. Marriage has nothing to do with money; it's about love and commitment. I don't make any money as I'm unemployed at the moment and I want more sex. You are so wrong. 




 That's what I meant; hippies and wiccans alike are counter culture with strong, far from mainstream beliefs. As a recently former teenage girl, they (we?) Get a bad rep for insisting they are something they know nothing about, but that's just teens in general.  




 WHO NEEDS A HOUSE OUT IN HACKENSACK? 




 Wiccans get a bad rep because they are like the equivalent of hippies, and teenage girls think they are Wiccan.  




 Honestly, in schools. World Religions is required in a lot of places. When I learned it in sixth grade, we learned of the Abrahamic religions (and a bunch of others) but not how they were connected; my mom explained it. It would help cure a lot of hatred. 




 A poor people rock where geography isn't a priority. 




 Dude. I get you mean to be sweet, but you are sort of treating OP like a commodity. Good effort, bad approach.  




 I have a fear to the point of a full blown phobia. I will probably have nightmares from these pictures tonight and I can't even go near a snake if I have a lawn mower. I am petrified of them. Though, I am working on it with subs like that one. 




 How many people do you live with. 




 Heiney? 




 Snakes terrify me. But I totally agree. I love the way that community fawns over their little guys and girls the same way I do my buns. It takes some of the terror out. 




 Touch.  




 I also got married. At 20. My wife would have had to drop out so we got hitched. Still very happy about that decision.  









 Well there are. Guys can even do it missionary. It's not that complex. 




 Probably all the aftermath of the last episode. The wreckage of their lives. Jesus either dead or in boarding school, and coping with that change. Ana either dead or fighting to keep her baby. Marianna dealing with her brother gone and possibly her bio mom and/or sister. Responsibility for the accident and what about Brandon's car? The kiss with Monte and Lena and if that wrecks the marriage of Stef and Lena, which I doubt it will. Just my predictions.  




 You two look great. 




 When it comes up 3 years in a seemingly life long relationship it's childish. He has strung OP along for three years. 









 Iam*Judger*AMA 




 I agree. Obviously if your health and safety depend on it, then it's fine, but being stealth is being a closet case and being a closet case helps no one. Don't expect others to stand for your rights if you won't stand for them.  




 "Hunk" and "Future Model" type shirts don't get to me. At that point, babies don't have much to offer but their looks. Nothing wrong with saying they're beautiful, male or female. Now, by 6 months when they are actually doing things, it's about accomplishments.  




 I'd like you to join us over at The Gay Agenda ^^^tm. Just look us up in the rainbow pages. 




 I thought bikers stole chaps from Cowboys and leprechauns stole rainbows from Noah/God and "normies" stole marriage from religion? It's almost like cultural shifts occur. 




 I thought this was /ftm and I was like "Honey... you're beautiful but you REALLY look like a girl." Then I realized that was exactly what you were going for you you're still beautiful and still look like a girl. 




 Or just learn to tuck. 




 11 year old me would have totally wanted 11 year old you. Then we both would grow up to be gay. 




 It's cool. I'm 20 and Harry Styles is the only man for me. Love me some 1D. 




 Dude no. My mom still won't "let" me have black hair in my face and I'm still pissed I couldn't be emo in middle/high school. Own that shit. 




 Beetlejuice is great! It's a dark comedy and a family story.  




 There's four of us. My mother in law is EXACTLY like Mother Gothel. My wife and I love it for that reason.  




 You loved her, and at some point only wanted the best for her. Continue that. Wish her happiness. And you will find it, too.  




 I'd have yelled at you too. The fuck is wrong with you thinking you should be a woman at 8? 




 Yes 




 I'm the person who's car got stolen. I was hit on Thursday two weeks ago. The adjuster ignored calls and didn't inform me that he was taking my car. I hadn't even agreed to the amount he offered. I showed up today to have my car cleaned out to learn he towed it an hour away with all of my stuff in it. 




 Posting for a friend.

Today, I finally got around to dealing with an accident that happened two weeks ago. I work for a company that rhymes with smationsmide. They haven't sent the title because I've been avoiding their calls and so today I got them good. I stole their car and didn't tell them and shipped it an hour away with all of their stuff in it. They have no money, no car, and none of their stuff now and I got them good! 




 Walmart as a corporation has phenomenal equality provisions. The do not discriminate at all. Specifically the store by me, there are employees of every race; employees that don't speak English, deaf employees, those with cerebral palsy or chromosomal defects, LGBT employees and more. 

My mom worked at Walmart for 14 years and was exposed to the ins and outs. A specific store may have problems with this, but as a corporation Walmart isn't as bad as people try to say. 




 Mostly, yeah, if you never wake up you die. 




 As a Pennsylvanian with friends from New England, this war happens every time we play Monopoly but I know I'm right so it's okay.  




 It also sort of glorifies cutting in Specials. My mom was nervous about me reading that at 12/13. 




 On Scott Westerfeld's website there was talk of a TV series. I think that would kill it though. 




 You mean the post-apocalyptic series that is far better than The Hunger Games and Divergent but isn't a movie yet? 




 20/F/PA.

U? 




 /u/TrollaBot test_subject6752 




 We waited until exactly two days after I turned 20 because we didn't want to be another "teen marriage" statistic lol.  




 Did you just change your diet or add exercise? 




 I got married in December at age 20. My wife and I have been together four and a half years. I don't think it's always too soon or too young. 









 I'm genderqueer afab. I like porn in that realm because I would like to *be* the pre/non op transwoman. I want to have my dick sucked and my boobs played with. Though, I rarely consume such porn because it's so transphobic and it makes me feel guilty. 




 It's the kind of tree you get golf tees from. 




 Yeah. That's pretty homophobic. Why are you here if you're just going to make lesbian jokes? 




 It's sexist because it's impossible the description only fits girls. And the opposite can not only fit men. 




 I'm thinking (and hoping) that he/she is suggesting that people properly train before using firearms because in his/her experience that isn't the case and it can be incredibly dangerous.

FTFY
 




 Oh. Wow I feel like a dick. Whenever I post a screen cap I get shit for my phone font. I have a galaxy s4 and the font is called Choco Cooky.  




 My preference.  




 With the proper training and licenses, But lets not make this standard. Some of the people I have known shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a gun.  


Why be sexist?
 




 1. Lemon juice had citric acid, which is awful for you. Look for it in ingredients when shopping.

2. Huge granulated sugar is not good. Chemical exfoliation is better for you. 

I'm sure there are others but that's what jumped out at me.

Edit: apparently I'm wrong. Live and learn. 




 "Natural" people scare me. They are generally intelligent enough to research and learn but they believe blatantly biased sources.  




 She probably would have been better off getting sunburn and taking a brillo pad to it. At least then she'd be admitted and they would take away the lemons and sugar. 




 An extra two dollars a box for someone to write the word on it.  









 Victoria's? 




 Smirnoff Ice tastes exactly like Jolly Ranchers. 




 Ibuprofen doesn't have a diuretic or antihistamine, both of which help clear up mucus and make things flow a bit better. 




 I could say it ain't so but darlin, what's the use?

The darker the chocolate yhe richer the taste

Now if that's where it's at then run and tell that!


I didn't know the soundtrack to Hairspray was considered rap. 




 I'm gonna kill you!

(You're welcome)


 




 And he can take it whenever he wants no questions asked and transport whoever he wants and whatever he wants. I'm sure he is also free to repaint it chartreuse and add orange flames. Since the car is his and all. 




 He lives there. That doesn't make it his. If he drives your car it's not suddenly his. 




 No, it isn't. She doesn't pay the rent/mortgage or the bills. She isn't responsible for her or anyone else's wellbeing.  




 You mean if she had "done the decent thing" and not had sex in her father's house this wouldn't have happened? 




 No, a guy calling someone a predator for being in his own house when his child was having sex is a weirdo. 




 In HIS house. She is 16, it's his house and he is free to stay. He wasn't in the room or anything. I hope you don't have children because you seem like an absolute weirdo. 




 Lesbian here; I prefer my wife and I to use different stuff. I like when she smells different than me. 




 This is sort of... wrong... buuuut I'll bite. Subarus are lesbian cars. 




 She reddited too. That's pretty sad... 




 No. He's teasing his kid. 




 20 year old lesbian here. Outright tell her. Tell her gay, straight, doesn't matter to you. Tell her you love her unconditionally.  




 Oh god I just realized how horrifying it is that I reddited a ton the night of my wedding. 




 Pizza makes me break out :( 

But I eat it anyway so I guess I'm more of a skincare social user. 









 Oh snap. This is why I shouldn't comment before I'm actually awake. 




 Mine hasn't been coming but last month my mom was diagnosed with non alcohol related cirrhosis. When she told me it came. 




 My period has been super irregular for the last year and a balf. Last week, it decided only after 22 days since the previous one, that it was coming. I woke up with a brand new sheet destroyed and apparently my sleep self was unhappy with the moisture because I had ripped the sheet up and *tucked it into my crotch*. I had been sleeping naked.  




 I'm transmasculine/genderqueer and currently identify as a lesbian. I'm married to a beautiful woman who, despite being 100% certain that she is gay, completely supports me and recognizes that top surgery is an inevitability and is fine with that. I know I will probably transition one day, if I can be sure it means not losing my family, but I know my wife will continue to identify as a lesbian and that is fine by me. Other transguys I know have dated girls that identify as lesbians and I have seen some relationships go from lesbian to straight. 

Have any of you guys had relationships like this? Would any of you begin a relationship with a woman who identified as a lesbian? I'm not looking for validation; I'm trying to start a conversation. 




 As many fuck ups, this happened roughly 10 years ago. I was about 10 and needed to poop. It was midsummer and, living in the Poconos (Northeast Pennsylvania) it was quite hot out. At this time, there was no air conditioning in our house, so windows were all open. Knowing this was going to be a long poop, I decided to find a means of entertaining myself. 

The previous Christmas, my Grammy had gotten me and my brother a kid size accordian to share. We had barely touched it. I figured this was as good a time as any, so I made sure it would make sound, and headed to the bathroom.

I sat down and began trying different notes. I've always been pretty good with music; singing in church since age 3, clarinet since 8, so I could recognize notes by sound pretty easily. I figured out the beginning of the song and played it a few times while trying to figure out the next part.

It was going spectacularly and I was so excited to be able to share my learnings with my family. I went down stairs after I was done, and went out on the front porch to tell my parents the news.

I was greeted by my parents, brother, and several neighbors singing the song to me and then asked how my trip to the bathroom went. 

TL;DR London Bridge was falling down and embarrassment was falling up. 









 We have been married for three months, together four and a half years. Before we got married, sex was roughly weekly. On our wedding night, she fell asleep in the middle of it. We had sex several times the first week and then it plummeted. I don't think we had sex at all I'm February and have once this month, where it was all me touching her and I barely got kissed. She offers to take care of me but I'm not even allowed to touch her breasts. I want to make love to my wife. I constantly feel rejected and unattractive. I love her and want to be with her but I hate feeling like this. 




 For almost a year, I have been paying for the unlimited card with bring your own phone. My phone is a red LG phone with a slide out keyboard. It's not a smart phone. When I had AT T the Internet use was disabled because it wasn't a part of the plan and we didn't want any upcharges. I don't know how to turn it back on and it's really inconvenient because I can't get picture messages. How can I turn it back on? If this isn't the right place I'm sorry but I didn't know where else to look. 














 My wife and I have recently realized that a large majority of lesbian sex media is centered around small, athletic bodies. Obviously not all lesbians are small, athletic people. What are your choice ways of making love to your lady, if one or both of you don't fit that stereotype? 




 I live in a semi-rural area. Girls get pregnant way too young here all the time. It's not Bible Belt area though, so it's not really a big deal to most people. It's a big deal to me, though. I'm going to college so I can one day support my family doing something that I love and am passionate about. I'm married to my partner, whom I've been with for four and a half years. All I want is a baby, but we can't have one because we are only 20 with no real way to afford one. Her sister, who is 18, is due in April and is getting everything handed to her for it. When we were 200 dollars short on rent because my job didn't pay me, they told us they knew this would happen and we were stupid to move out. But here we are, working hard at our goals, not having the one thing I really want, and it doesn't seem to do any good! We had no transportation for the last six weeks so we are yet another semester behind due to having to withdraw. We moved back in with my parents to save up toward our goals, but it doesn't matter because all of our money goes to household stuff anyway! I feel like I will never be able to have a family, which is all that I want. I know it's not a good time, and I know that we can't afford it and don't have enough room for a baby, but it's the only thing I want and it sucks that I feel punished for doing what's right. 

TL;DR: I want a child and can't have one because I can't afford it, but other people get to screw up and have just that. 




 I'm just so disappointed. I live about 80 miles from the city and have all my life, and last year was my first time there at all and at a pride event bigger than four stands in a park. I feel so bad for her, but it really sucks we don't get to march. 




 (Posted for my brother's girlfriend) So my boyfriend and I decided to take my three dogs to PetSmart to get them new stuff. While he was doing something in the car, I loaded the three of them into a shopping cart together. It was cold and I was tired of waiting for him, so I set off toward the store. I was a bit annoyed that he was taking so long, so, when he began yelling my name as I walked into the store with my cart load of dogs, I ignored him. This was where I fucked up. I turned around to see him yelling and continued into the store. That's when I saw the phones and people dressed in blue and yellow. I brought a cart full of dogs into Best Buy, the store next to PetSmart.

TL;DR: my boyfriend tried so save me from bringing my three dogs into Best Buy and failed. 




 I have no idea when the last time I posted in this sub was but I was banned several days ago. Mods will not answer me, so I tried to ask on the ask sub, and I am banned there, too. I asked in modmail there, and all I got was a message that if I continue to message modmail, I'll be reported for modmail disruption. I responded that I needed an answer and I'm more than willing to stop messaging modmail when I get one. No response after that. I wouldn't care but it's the sub about a view I hold very strongly and I don't understand how I could be banned. It's really unfair and I just want to know why it happened. 




 My friend wants to get one next week. He's looking for black skin tone, stp and sex capable. He wants it circumcised and durable. Any recommendations of products you guys have used and liked? 














 He is painting it black and gray, from yellow, which my mom picked out 30 years ago. I'm not contesting that it needed paint long ago, but he is making it awful. He didn't bother to tape the ceiling, which he doesn't plan to paint, the trim is hideous with both black and gray on it because he taped it poorly and it just looks awful. He painted cabinets multiple colors and poorly at that without asking first. He has stuff all over and is taking a very long time to finish. Each night, and whenever he isn't painting, he puts his painting supplies in the bathtub so no one can bathe. You have to go through the kitchen to turn the heat on, and we live in the north east. My mom has a ton of medical problems and needs to have access to food, heat, and the bathroom. She doesn't want to say anything because she is grateful he is trying to help, but he is really causing problems.

TL;DR: my brother is trying to help but is making a bigger problem. 




 I know you have to be clean for something like a year, but wouldn't it make more sense to put nonalcoholics ahead on the list since they didn't make themselves sick? I'm not asking for a change my view, I just want to know why they qualify for it. 









 She is my best friend and my mom. She's wonderful. She was a foster and adoptive and biological mother and she took in my now wife when we were 17 and her mother through her out. She's my hero. And today she was diagnosed with non-alcohol related cirrhosis. She actually actively decided not to be an alcoholic as her father was one. Please, just pray for her. I'm so destroyed right now. I'm only 20. I'm not ready for this at all.
