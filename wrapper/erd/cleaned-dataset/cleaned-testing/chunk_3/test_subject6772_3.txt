 *Look, American families and small businesses are still struggling.  Many are still asking the question, where are the jobs?  Some Americans are doing better, and frankly thats great news.  But most middle-class families arent seeing the improvement in their daily lives.  So weve got a lot more work to do. "*

And yet he lays out no plans to do this, claims government doesn't create jobs, fights UI extension, wants to cut food stamps, welfare, school lunches. The only plan the republicans ever have is tax cuts for the wealthy, increase defense spending, 'reforming' social security, and pushing a pipeline. All the while ignoring infrastructure.

And he says 'where are the jobs'. Well, I dunno, you said people didn't need a UI extension because it made them lazy and they wouldn't find work - so you must believe there are plenty of jobs for them to work. 




 Yeah, I'm laughing too. 









 Yeah, and it's possible I read /r/gonewild just for the comments. 




 Yet, on the campaign trail, I am sure we will hear him say "Every vote matters!" 




 According to our conservative fundie friends lots of people have been hurt when jeebus sent hurricanes/etc to punish America because of gay marriage. Divorce, murder, rape, wars, ignoring the sick and the poor, etc doesn't bother god. Just gays. 




 Conservatives: "We have had a minimum wage for decades and we believe a few economists when they say it is bad. But we think most scientists are full of shit when it comes to climate change."

Derp. 
































































 Hunh. So they were going to confirm this whole time but wanted to use her for politics. 

America. Fuck Yeah. 














 Weird, more sites are doing that, I use ghostery and ad blocker and don't see them. 



























































 It is patently unfair for Senate Republicans to single out
same-sex marriage for government disapproval. As Sen. Hillary
Clinton (D-NY) told her colleagues,  if we were really con-
cerned about marriage...[w]e should have been in this Cham-
ber trying to amend our Constitution to take away at the very
first blush the idea of no-fault divorce  (
CR
,J
uly 13,  2004,
S7995). In a nation still battling prejudice against homosexual-
ity,  gays and lesbians serve as easy targets for politicians as-
piring to appear strong on family values. But political expedi-
ency provides poor grounds indeed for continuing to treat a
minority unfairly. 



















 *shrugs * Ok...so a rw think tank is tracking birth rates for immigrants (hunh, they didn't add 'illegal' to it as a dog whistle for the idjits?)

Can't say I am shocked that a group that advocates for less immigrants is saying this and that a rw rag is picking it up. 

This same group claims *The Center has asserted that there are adverse effects of immigration on the environment* - which is odd because according to the right humans have no affect on the environment and if they do it is ok because 'profit'. "Sure, dumping this waste in the lake kills all the fish and ruins your ability to drink it - but the government shouldn't stop a company from creating jobs!"

Git r done.

 ISIS is filled with religious fundies, so there really isn't a science discussion to be had. To such people it can melt anything if they pray about it before hand and god wills it. Or if they accuse the beams of being gay, in which case (according to religious people in this country who vote republican) got will send storms to destroy the beams and anyone in the building that has such beams. 




 You have to mix it properly with the blood of a virgin (or is it Virginian? Always mix those two up). Not that I know anything about it all, my uh...friend billy told me about it. 




 The Grim Reaper. 














 She knows she won't win. She just wants to get some cred with people. She will use this to trade 'votes' from those who say they back her. She'll endorse the person she thinks will win in exchange for later political position/favors. 




 Think about your avg republican voter here. They don't think or care about such things really. They just want to use deaths for their own gain. 9/11/2001? Support the president or you are a traitor, use the deaths for new laws and wars.

We aren't dealing with rational people who care about the US, they just want to 'win' elections because 'winning' is awesome. When Obama won and they lost they decided to do all they could to destroy that loss, not support him (like they did bush after 9/11), and whine daily about things - including making up things (he was born in kenya, will confiscate all guns, destroy stock market, let ebola kill us all, etc).

It isn't about country for them. I would like one conservative to tell me they honestly care about this country and always did - but that won't happen because what they care about is getting some human, any human on the planet, into office with an (R) after their name. They are mad, sad (sore losers) over 2008/2012 and they care about nothing at all but 'winning' - then suddenly, not matter what or who is in office they will kneel on their flags and open their bibles and just praise them.

Just like they worshiped bush. The greatest man, to them, in the 21st century, who saved America. Yeah...I won't ever make the mistake of voting for a republican in my life again. 




 Funny how the right is so silent on this here. Hmmmm. Maybe they are sick of hearing of it too but don't want to upset their masters (so much courage on the right...when they aren't kneeling down and boot licking). 




  A 14-year-old Mexican girl seized by federal police and sent to a woman in Houston is being returned home after DNA tests showed she is not the woman's daughter.
 
Last week's removal of a screaming Alondra Luna from her middle school last week provoked an outcry from her family, who said authorities ignored proof of her identity. 
 
Federal police said they were acting on a judge's orders to send the girl to Dorotea Garcia, who says the girl had been illegally taken to Mexico by her father years ago. 



















 Religion. Sheesh, can't folks give it all a rest for a bit? "You put carpet down! AHHHHH!" *facepalm* 

No matter where you seem to go in the world there are religious conservative fundies who get all upset over stupid shit. "People are hungry and dying? Wars? Meh. We must not allow desecration in a holy shrine! Where are your priorities!?" 














 He doesn't have the time for that. He has to focus on another benghazi investigation, the most important thing the GOP has going for them. 














 And when Unemployment Benefit Extensions were set to expire where was he? Oh yeah.... 

*Mitch McConnell Laughs at the Unemployed as He Promises to Vote No on UI Benefits* 

But this, this he will fast track. Wonder who owns him? Someone obviously does.

 














 Thanks for the information. 




 Oh, ok. Here is how I view it - there should be outrage whenever government agents/employees kill people. Waco and Ruby Ridge sure as hell got some people up in arms. Ah, but those were white people I guess and the right suddenly cared.

It's not my fault that white cons don't get upset when white people get killed by cops. Maybe that is because, in general, they don't care when cops shoot people. They feel it is always justified. 

If you have some cases where white people were killed/hurt/etc by cops you think should be discussed because you come down on the side of the person being injured by the cops - post em. And I will back the victim of police brutality.  




 They are trying to, they are blaming Obama for the delays. No shocker there. 

I didn't have any issue with them wanting to look into the whole ordeal and get some basic answers. But jeebus, it has gotten downright silly. 

On the other hand, it really does show they have nothing else, at all, when it comes to Obama. They were wrong about him being born in kenya, wrong about him when they said he would crash the market, take all the guns, turn the US into a caliphate, threw open the borders, etc and so on.

They got nothing, and this just is making them look stupid.

You would think there would be some on the right who would see this and tell em to stuff it -but they are too invested now emotionally to act rationally.  









 That got tossed after 9/11/2001, Anthrax, patriot act, tsa, and the Iraq war. 




 Best comment I have seen all day. Upvoted it ;) 









 So does the city/county have to pay him?

Step 1. Speed in reverse
Step 2. Get ticket
Step 3. Profit 




 Well, someone apparently needed to - look, I can be sarcastic too! :) 




 Story isn't big on details, hopefully nothing but if anyone has other info please feel free to add it. 














 If you're in the US (as I am) you probably know our justice system is screwed up beyond all hope. I wish I had answers on how to fix it, but even if I did the system is so screwed no one would implement the fixes. 




 My mom put me on the bus and that was that. Sort of. She became active in the school. Volunteered her time there, got to be good friends with all the teachers and the principal. She and her best friend (whose daughter was my age and lived a few doors down) were at the school a lot and would hang out and smoke in the teacher's lounge, hand out hot chocolate to us kids who did patrol, etc.

A drone would have been easier :) but it had it's perks. I got the teacher I liked each year and me and my friend always got in the same class. 




 MSM is in the business of making money, and they make a lot of it from corporations that advertise on their shows. 

Add in to that the big wigs in these media companies probably own stakes in gas/oil and make more profit if said companies do well (see Sanders and his take on raising royalties on land the govt leases for drilling/etc).

The internet is allowing more and more information to find it's way into the public than ever before - another reason some companies want to have more control over it. 

I don't even have a tv plugged in anywhere but the kitchen, where I like to listen to a show while I cook. News sources for me are a pick and choose online. With twitter I follow every TV news station in the US (about 600 of them total, ignoring some duplicate stations and pbs ones). 

Radio is mostly owned by a few corporations who restrict the local licenses (they buy them up and you can't get one - they let them sit silent to kill competition). The internet is leveling the playing field more and more. 









 I don't have a phone anyway, so good luck to anyone trying to call me at all :) 









 Isis kills more muslims than christians. Wonder which ones the fox/hannity/etc groups focus on.

It obviously isn't discrimination against christians - they probably did something bad like run from government isis soldiers who told them to stop, failed to obey orders from 'cops' etc.

Sure...maybe some were killed because they were different, but that's just a few bad apples. 

Interesting how things are looked at when you apply a conservative lens to things. Suddenly, cons believe there is discrimination and hate somewhere. Hunh. Weird. 




 That's ok, I don't answer the phone when the IRS calls me. So we are even :) 




 I'll just repost what I said in another thread on this:

Is that some sort of conservative attempt at a 'gotcha' moment? Man, cons are funny people.

Ever hear the old adage "It takes money to make money"? in cases like this, yes, you use resources you have in an attempt to make a change regarding the use of said resources.

You might run a website discussing the over use of coal, and it might be powered by electricity generated by coal. That doesn't make the information you are presenting bad, it is using the system to fight the system.

Investing in the short term to change the long term, etc. But hey, it makes some people get all giddy and say "See, climate change and such isn't real! I is smurt man now, I saw someone use gas in their car and they drove to park on earth day to pick up litter! Hypocrites - it means thar ain't no problems! Wheeee look at me, I'm a super smart science minded conservative!"
 




 Let me try to explain the disconnect.

Man is working hard to support himself and kid. It's not enough. So he gets assistance. The right calls him a bum, welfare queen, etc, and runs around posting stories about how people like him are living up eating lobster and can't possibly be poor because he owns a tv.

Then: The right sits around telling people "If you work hard, you can make it!" all the while ignoring that working hard doesn't mean that at all. It usually means you are getting taken advantage of by people who aren't working hard but running things because they invested in a company and they feel they deserve more of the profits than those doing the actual work.

Those people the right cheers (investors) but when workers ask for me they get called greedy and we are told it will hurt the company and raise prices.

A more progressive view is that, sure, I don't have a problem with investors/etc making more - but I also think kicking down more to the people doing the actual work is the right thing to do.

Here's the thing for me: Despite what the right tells you....not every human can own their own company and be a millionaire. There would be no workers. We need workers to pick up trash, build things, cook, stock shelves, etc. They are just as much a part of this economy as anyone else and while they may not invest money they do invest time (though they do invest money in a way by getting a car, gas for work, right clothes, showers each day, etc and so on). 




 I wonder if that makes the bacon taste better?

 It isn't necessarily that more people favor gay marriage (although they do) - I think, perhaps, more now favor less religion in our government as a reason for having some laws.

The rw argument is our nation will be destroyed, mainly by god, if we allow gays to marry, serve in the military, etc. 

They don't think in a logical manner, they think in a religious way like their cousins in isis/etc. More people nowadays think more for themselves and don't need some invisible sky daddy to play dictator.

Real freedom is something conservatives fight against because it isn't something they can control with bible verses and fear. They want everyone to be obedient to what they are because they are scared if they don't force people to god will do bad things to us all. 




 Investor: "I want more return on my investment"
conservatives: "Smart thinking, we can cut jobs, raise prices some, etc"

Worker: "I want more return on my investment of my labor"
Conservatives: "Greedy bastards! You are what is wrong with this country! You don't deserve more!" 




 You don't need guns just like you don't need science or health care. Just pray. Like when someone you know is sick - don't donate money to find cures, help cover the costs, etc. Pray it away.

Someone is attacking the US? Just pray. You see a crime, drop to your knees and have faith.

See two men kissing? Pray and god will send storms down to punish the country. 

Fundie conservatives. They don't make much sense. 









 If you want to appeal to them just try treating them like fellow humans and citizens who want to live, work, and defend their country and get married - sort of like everyone else is allowed to do.  














 Yep. And if you say it isn't you aren't truly a good christian conservative. The devil is messing with your mind and tricking you - mainly because he has more power now that people with the same genital structure can kiss/marry without being stoned. 




 The republican version is "Rape the earth day". They celebrate by fracking and dropping bombs all over the place and pushing for new laws to kick science books out of school (to be replaced by bibles)

 




 Only when people who don't work for the government do it. 









 It does have the flag on it. Now all it needs are some bible verses on it and a cross. Add some ammo in etched with "John 3:16" and it would be a rw'er dream gun (note, I am all for gun ownership I just find some gun owners to be a little...well...'interesting'). 
























 *But members of Congress are exempted from rules that otherwise prohibit people from having assault weapons, including AR-15s, Capitol Police said.*

Laws for thee but not for me. 














 You must be a conservative because it went over your head. The right will howl about this and the person I replied to was stating that vandalism didn't teach acceptance. Which I agree with.

Now these same cons who will preach that in this case will ignore such core ideals and resort to any and all methods to kill/blow up things/etc in the ME thinking that by doing that they will somehow gain the acceptance and gratitude of the people they are killing. You don't gain acceptance by vandalism or wars/etc, yet it seems the right only gets that idea when it is one them on the receiving end. 









 Sounds like a plan to me, I got nothing better to do :) 




 Well, nothing teaches country in the middle east like we are serious about peace like blowing em all to hell. But for some reason we keep doing it.... 


































 Here is what republicans want:

-Back Israel and push for Armageddon so Jesus will return.

-Ban teaching of evolution and sex ed in schools

-War with Iran (so they can "support the troops" and honor them when they get killed/injured)

-Kick people off food stamps, health care, welfare, unemployment benefits while killing jobs and then calling people lazy (like how they called the unemployed lazy while blaming obama for them not being able to get jobs....)

-Gut science when it comes to climate change and space, funnel money into more guns for peace

-Privatize more schools and prisons so their backers can profit (money is the true god of the right, the golden calf if you will)

-Ban gay marriage, kick gays out of the military - all so that they can save America from hurricane and floods (and earthquakes, like in Oklahoma which are being caused by fracking, but the right denies it because it is science and not in the bible).

And so much more.
 




 That was shitty of her, but she probably doesn't give a crap what I think. But now that they have the body she is in deep doo-doo. 




 If we treated sports like politics the Buckeyes would still be national champions :) 




 For Conservative Media, Iran Is Always A Year Away From Having Nukes 
http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/02/21/for-conservative-media-iran-is-always-a-year-aw/185058

*In December 2005, both Rush Limbaugh and a Washington Times editorial repeated a distortion from the Drudge Report of comments by International Atomic Energy Agency director general Mohamed ElBaradei regarding how soon Iran might have a nuclear weapon; the Times claimed ElBaradei said Iran was "a few months" away and Limbaugh claimed ElBaradei said Iran was "months away."* 




 Netanyahu in 1992: Iran close to having nuclear bomb:

1992: Israeli member of parliament Binyamin Netanyahu predicts that Iran was 3 to 5 years from having a nuclear weapon.

1992: Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres predicts an Iranian nuclear warhead by 1999 to French TV.

1995: The New York Times quotes US and Israeli officials saying that Iran would have the bomb by 2000.

 Well, republicans are big on 'belief' - from their religion and fear god will kill us all because of gays to believing climate change is just a scheme to make money. 

It's all about belief and not facts/science. 





























 Cons tells us if you work hard companies will reward you. Unless you are just an avg worker they can ditch after your hard work and replace with someone younger and cheaper.

Of course, they also believe every single human on the planet can own their own company and be wealthy. Wouldn't be any workers of course...but hey, details don't matter.... 




 Ah, republicans, the party of science.

Earth is 6k years old, climate change is BS, being gay is a choice that causes god to send hurricanes.

The American isis wears a flag and carries a bible. 
























 Most developed countries have single payer, paid sick time and holiday time off, more time off for pregnancy/birth, and spend a lot less on their military.

They also usually have more restrictions on guns.

So...not sure why I care what other countries have when it comes to abortions. 














 Guess we should treat guns like women's rights then the right will do all they can to pass laws restricting them.

Or treat women like guns and they will become holier than the cross to the right. 




 Often times people, like the disabled, send someone to the store for them. Or someone may have transportation issues, etc. 




 Just wait, breitbart/levin/etc will be out later saying that Obama is sending our ships there to give them to Iran as a gesture of peace and working together to make the US into a caliphate.

And the right wing will believe it. 




 Another weird thing is that Jews don't believe Jesus was the son of god, basically they are 'atheists' when it comes to Christianity. 

*Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?*

Overall, Jews reject the ideas of Christians but fundies have bound themselves to those who reject their beliefs. They see Israel as their path to both salvation from punishment and to the end times. Their belief is that if they are nice to a nation that rejects the very core of their beliefs they will get some sort of favor in return (and they seem to forget all the times god punished israel/judah for rejecting him....).

Their allegiance doesn't really make a lot of sense. I can see them as an ally in the region from a strategic point of view. But to put them above reproach and accuse anyone who speaks out against their policies as anti-semitic/hater/anti-christian is just...well, nuts. 




 Not the media so much as the actual people themselves, especially (but not only) online.

I follow every tv station in the US on twitter and see plenty of news. Yeah, there are some loons on the left too - another reason I am proudly, and have been since '84 a registered independent.

Now the news I read (out side a few places) generally isn't overly slanted (because I see so much of it). But I do read comments and rw sites/comments. I also listen to a lot of radio and shows on talkshoe (where anyone can broadcast live for free, have a chatroom and phone number for call in).

And the more I have seen/heard the more I am convinced that the rw cons in this country are just plain nuts. Not rational people trying to have a rational discussion. 

As far as hurricanes/gays - just google around. And what you will find are the people saying that are conservatives and republicans. And to make it more interesting try to find someone with that alignment saying it's crazy. They just shrug and ignore it as though they expect it or partially believe it (Christians are a huge chunk of the populace here and the more fundie ones are republicans - and they do believe god punishes the US for it's 'sins)

The left has it's wackos as well, but with a big tent they tend to fight with each other and it balances out in a broad sense. On the right folks tend to march in lockstep on a broad scale. They have a common hate (obama/liberals) and a common core (bible/religion).

The two groups are different. 




 Nice use of 'strawman' - people seem to pull out that word a lot....

Conservatives here in the US are, by and large, loony religious zealots. Against gays in military, gay marriage, etc because they fear god will send hurricanes/judge America. 

They insist Obama is a muslim - again, bringing religion into politics. They create policies based on bible verses they take out of context "If a man does not work he does not eat" kind of crap.

Their whole philosophy they back up with god. And yes, they are wanting to punish America. Look at what was being said when Obama was elected; they wouldn't cooperate with him, rush/et al said they hope he (thus we) fail. 

Try listening to rw radio for a week or reading what the loonies are claiming (obama and ebola and how we were all gonna die cause he hates america, the whole stolen libyan jet BS which turned out to be false, Obama will take all the guns with no discussion of how he was going to, etc and so on). 




 I ain't no big fan of Obama either and not a huge fan of the aca (better than nothing to get the ball rolling). Some of his policies and decisions I can certainly complain about. But, yeah, these people are just plain nuts. If he looks the wrong way while at the podium they run off screaming he is a commie mooslim who took all the border patrol away and threw open the border for ebola laden kids trained by isis.

I don't take the right serious anymore and will never, ever, in my whole life vote for a republican (which I did up until 2004, including raising some funds for ole bush). 

It's like some virus from space landed on earth and took over their minds and erased critical thinking skills, courage, honesty, etc. It makes me regret saying I ever voted for them in the past. Was i that dumb or was the party a little different last century? 




 Can you imagine if Hillary wins it all? My god, their heads will explode. Bet you they make a run on gun stores again swearing by all they deem holy that like Obama she WILL take all the guns. Not that she wants to, no logic on how she could if she wanted to, but that she will. And the suckers will believe it like they did with Obama.

Of course someone will come along and say "But Obama was in favor of the awb" yeah...that's a long way from he "will" take all your guns - which is what some still claim.

Not rational humans and the type who make america look dumb as hell. 




 Which means cons will try to get him replaced with someone more nutty. Tea party folks especially can't handle reason and logic. It's all about how they 'feel' about someone. 




 Of course the comments are insane - do you know any conservatives that are rational? 

It's all about emotions. They are pissed off because they lost twice and want to punish obama/usa for losing. There is not one conservative that care about this country over their little parties (tea/gop). Think about it: They are mostly fundies who love Israel over the US and are praying daily for Jesus to come back and kill off most the human race. The want this. They live for it.

We're not dealing with sane or rational people. Not one, not one anywhere, will stand up and call BS on things like this, Iraq, etc because they have no courage and no principles. They just have getting on their knees for their party and to pray for god to punish/kill all the sinners.

Loony people. 




 Does anyone with a bit of intelligence actually read dailycaller each day? Good god, it's like WND but worse.

Of course, the people dumb enough to want congress to hold hearings about nasa and temperature readings probably would read it .

Conservatives make me embarrassed to call myself an American. If I ever travel abroad it will be with my head held in shame should anyone recognize I come from the usa. 




 What is most likely is the right is trolling because, as usual, they can't stand on the issues so they will just attack with made up shit. 




 The right is always wanting to destroy things. I guess it speaks to their ignorance and lack of desire to learn and understand things.

We took out Iraq and Afghanistan and that fixed what? Leaders of Al Qaeda and we still aren't 'safe' from terrorists and people carrying bottled water onto planes.

America has become the land of perpetual fear where there is always a 'devil' we need some party to 'save' us from. Republicans have a 'jesus' complex. 




 Don't even have to click on it to know it is rw'ers whining and crying because they can't win on issues :) 




 And Obama being born in Kenya may sink his presidential chances. Riiiight.

I love the right, they are so much fun and so easy. It's like they live in a bias bubble and can't see outside of it. Again. 




 It's Luke behind the mask. Or Jar-Jar. 




 From what I can tell by the schools, but their websites aren't clear on that :/ 




 you can tell the republicans are scared by how loony they get.

Look at everything they claimed about Obama (and still do).  




 Paul lets conservatives here distance themselves from bush and the iraq war (and tsa/patriot act/etc) while still supporting what they see as conservative ideals.

In reality, they probably don't agree with him on a lot of things. When it comes to Israel, for example, they are still married to the bible above the country whereas (at one point) Paul looked at it from a more practical point of view.

Conservatives are, at their core, religious people. They react based on what they believe god wants or doesn't want. On the country side they don't care about gay marriage - but they believe god will punish a country that allows it. So paul is sort of a go between where they can pretend it isn't about religion while hedging their bets: "I am still a conservative but not really" is pretty much how it goes with them.

Paul gives them street cred early on which they will toss out the window in a heartbeat as soon as they can. They can pretend to have principles and 'look good' right now because they know he won't win. Then later they will push for someone who is truly backwards and regressive. 




 While people in both parties can act that way let's look at some basics.

During the bush admin, yes there were negatives tossed out. But much of it was correct. The economy tanked, wars were a bust, and we lost more freedoms and government got more power.

Obama gets elected and predictions from the GOP are a bust. Obama didn't take all of the guns, he didn't let ebola kill us all, the economy didn't tank and market crash, he wasn't born in Kenya, he didn't force all the conservatives into Fema camps and turn the US into a caliphate.

There is 'negative' and then there is bat shit crazy. The cons in this country are nuts. 




 Thanks for the insight.

It would be nice, imho, if the media covered more of what reps/etc do locally for people (Joyce Beatty is my rep here in Ohio) or if the reps would put more info out showing how they have helped people locally (again, all of this aside from voting).

I was complaining in an earlier thread (in news) about the lack of local talk shows on radio (consolidation, local shows replaced by big radio names, etc). Way back in my day we had more local radio where politicians actually talked about constituent services and the like.

It seems candidates disappear off the radar (to the media) when elected and the general public doesn't see the day to day work they do and feel more and more isolated from their congressperson. 

Just my 2 cents :) 




 Like I said, I tend to be a tad cynical :)

Seems like there is a lot of 'horsetrading' that goes on in the background, lobbying, politics and the people elected are less interested in what your average person thinks about an issue than they are in bigger/more powerful/influential 'groups'.

I have had success with issues I needed assistance with in the pass by calling my congressperson. Nice people, good information, even made a call on my behalf to help get things resolved. 

But when it comes to voting I just don't see A) that they would listen to me and B) that the congress person ever even knows I called/etc and what it is I said. But - obviously, they can't spend all day listening to people. Not practical.

Can you explain what happens to the letters/calls/etc - are they collated, numbers given, some comments passed on? 




 She could just say she is in the militia and the cat was caught sneaking over the border. 

As far as Texas:

 3)       Shooting stray Dogs and Cats (Penal Code 42.09 Animal Cruelty).  Any person who shoots a non-livestock animal, which includes any stray or feral cat or dog, and a wild living creature previously captured, can be charged with a felony offense.  Penal Code 42.092 of the State of Texas law states that a person must have the owners consent to kill the animal (exceptions to prosecution are provided in Section 42.092(e)(1)).  It is clear that a stray dog or cat either has no owner or that the person who shoots the animal did not get the owners consent. 




 How much do they even care on average? Calls, faxes, emails, which do they even pay attention to?

Seems like lobbyists $peak the loudest to them. But, maybe at my age I am just a tad cynical :) 




 I think they are just trying to make sure a crime really happened first. Was it feral, domestic, was it even a real cat/photo? Was the cat already dead and she just abused the body as a joke? Etc and so on. 

Employers can fire you for anything, the government needs a little more to go on (usually. One would hope anyway) before charging someone.  




 The whole thing boils down to one simple idea:

You don't have to customize things in a way you don't want. Whether it is a credit card company and the pic you want for a background or a bakery not wanting to write something on a cake.

You still have to bake the cake, etc, but customization has always been protected. From cuss words to everything else. 

I don't understand why all of that gets lost in these discussions. 




 Probably because a lot of more progressive people don't need to be babied and lied to in order to support their ideals. Like religious people in the ME or here - they don't want anything that contradicts their beliefs, they want someone to lie to them and validate their hate/fears. 

A smart business person will give them that and get their money in return because they know not one of them would dare challenge someone on what they say. Might put a crack in their armor and belief systems.

Interestingly enough note how rw christians here brag that they are not like muslims and have become more 'progressive' over the centuries. Then they attack the people muslims listen to and tell them there is a better way, etc. 

If only they would take their own advice, not listen but think, and continue trying to be more progressive than they used to be. Again, it is funny how they tout how much more progressive their faith has become - slavery is bad now, blacks can marry whites, women can vote, etc - all progressive ideals compared to the backwards way of how they used to use the bible.

The right needs someone to listen to because deep down they know they are wrong and don't like to face that. 




 That the 20 soldiers/vets who kill themselves a day aren't going to hell.

Fundie conservatives believe that they are (and you can look that up) and religion/hell are popular with them - and their opinion that death by suicide leads to hell is quite popular amongst them

They call the poor, homeless, sick, etc lazy, stupid, weak - even the veterans they claim to care about. But I guess their idea of care is to send them to wars or something.

So, yeah, I guess my view of them will be unpopular to them but it is at least accurate.

Just because a depressed vet (or anyone else) takes their life doesn't mean they will burn in hell forever. I don't care how popular that idea is amongst them, it's stupid. 




 I have an open hostility towards some in that faith. They want to make their own little 'caliphate' here, I call em the American ISIS. Rule by religion. Kick science out of schools. Encourage discrimination of others out of fear god will punish the whole country (two men kissed? Hurricane!). Control the medical decisions of women and relegate people to praying for healing instead of getting actual health care.

They are sick people who serve mostly money and their own interpretation of some old book - which they will put above their own country.

Dangerous bigots who should be on a watch list. 




 see my earlier reply. And yeah, a multiparty system would be great. Just like having radio/tv/papers again that weren't owned and controlled by the few. From politics to info the few want to control the many - hence why some were so against net neutrality. 




 Why does a show have to have a hard political bent? I registered as an independent in 1984, and I have listened to a lot of local shows over the years where the host was pretty open to all sides of things and facilitated discussion instead of trying to overtly control it.

The was licenses are structured now and with consolidation we have lost a lot of local hosts and instead have shows like here on one local station hours of beck, then rush, then hannity, then levin - about 11 hours of rw talk radio on a national level and most of it just fear mongering and distortions.

Oh hey, here is an idea, I could get my own station and start a show, right? No. Big companies have bought up the spectrum here to control and stop competition (same in most markets). 

Yes, I have worked in radio (and still do, albeit internet only at the time - though we can broadcast a pirate signal). 

Radio has become like politics - run by the few for the few and small, local community radio has been taken away for the most part.

Or...you could just listen to his show (or hannity, who is worse) and actually think for yourself and you would pick up on these things. 




 When I go fishing down at the creek I like to putt around in a small 'john boat' (as we call em). I prefer using a Minn Kota trolling motor.

What kind of trolling motor are you using? 




 Rush blames the Obama's for just about everything. The guy lies and is wrong on so many things I don't know how he stays on the air...except conservatives see him as a preacher and just go on 'faith'. 




 Some american soldiers murdered people in iraq. They weren't enemies, just civilians.

Believe it or not some people in our military are like that.

There are people who guns who shoot/rob others. Seen them in real life myself, but not in a bagel shop, at a pizza shop.

So...ok. What's your point anyway? 




 Veteran was wrong in this case. 

The old "I am willing to die for your freedoms" stuff wears old when you have someone who is willing to basically steal from protestors over a piece of cloth. Bush walked all over the damned flag with his wars, tsa, patriot act, etc and got cheered on. After 9/11 the right insisted we stand behind him no matter what...benghazi happens and suddenly these same people want to impeach.

The very people who will whine about people walking on the flag are the ones who stood by before saluting the screwing over of our troops. Patriotism isn't a flag you wave or a bible you thump.
 




 The media seems to cover such things a lot, which is fine. But there are laws that expire, need renewed, ones that update rules, etc and so on. 

There are a lot of laws that need fixed - from patriot act, tsa, etc to this like this: H.R.41: To temporarily increase the borrowing authority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for carrying out the National Flood Insurance Program.

Laws don't all have to be new and restrictive and there are enough problems in the legal codes we have to keep congress busy - if they are willing to fix them. 




 Some laws remove restrictions, some fix problems (VA/etc). Not all laws are made to restrict freedoms but help the government we pay for to run better and change as needed. 




 I was on it for a short time in the 90's. Was on worker's comp, they lost paperwork, so lost benefits for a time. It was no fun. Food stamps, putting off one bill for one month then another the next.

3 kids, disabled wife (now deceased) who didn't get benefits. Some months we did manage to save a little and got the kids happy meals. It was a huge treat to them but others looked down on us for being 'frivolous'. Long story short, after about 14 months and a hearing before 3 judges I got everything fixed and settlement and went back to work (though I still suffer from the injury, I turned down permanent partial disability so I could work and get out of the system. Still some jobs I can't do.) 




 Which is a dumb idea. You use less electric that month, coupons, etc... 




 Thanks for the new information! 




 So if you save a little each month....oh, wait, if you save a penny you aren't poor enough for conservatives. It means a penny more that the government can use to kill people in other countries.

Message to poor people - don't save a damn dime because if you do it means you aren't poor. You can't save up for anything. So quit suffering each month to try for something you want - it's not christian or american like, you know? 




 It ain't 'murican to not pray afore eating yer hot dogs and stop everything to grab yer bible and stand still fer da pledge. Git r done! 




 Ohioan here as well and I would agree. I am sick of driving around the countryside and seeing damn corn and soybeans. Pot would be awesome to see. Keep the pumpkin patches though :) 




 "We're going to have to have a meeting about all these damned meetings!" 




 If you read his FB page he is now claiming he is getting death threats for his beliefs and something about a gofundme page. LOL. OK buddy. He is just taking advantage of bigots who will shower him with money.

America. Fuck yeah. 




 If you notice on his FB page his last post was December. Then on the 14th he posted this crap. Then later on started a post basically saying it wasn't fair he was getting death threats, etc. And set up a gofundme. Sounds like a copycat. 




 Care to expand on that? I don't dislike religion, it's the followers of it I have problems with (and not all of them). 

I am guessing you have never had any issues at all with people using religion to control others via laws/etc? 




 My concerns are those with power in this country who use their religion to make decisions about laws. 

It seems, from your comments, that you don't like religious people all that much either. On that we seem to agree. 




 Don't know about there, but hope it goes away from here in the US sooner than later.

Fundies are against helping people, non-inclusive, believe people who kill themselves go right to hell (including the 20+ veterans a day that kill themselves). They want America to makes it's laws based on some old book and believe god sends hurricanes/floods/etc to harm america because two men kiss each other (all the while ignoring rape, robbery, murder, suffering of the poor, starving kids, etc...yeah...all god cares about when it comes to sin and the US is gay people.)

 




 A new veterans hospital in Colorado is on track to become one of the most expensive medical centers in the world with a price tag so far of $1.7 billion.

Theres a $100-million-and-still-rising price tag for an atrium and concourse with curving blond-wood walls and towering glass windows,

http://www.abcactionnews.com/news/local-news/i-team-investigates/veteran-says-he-was-repeatedly-put-on-hold-by-veterans-suicide-hotline

It isn't that they can't afford more people to help with the phones, it is that they don't want to. 




 Yeah, but he was afraid they would end up on hillary's private email server and he would somehow be tied to Benghazi....Everything ties to Benghazi!!11!1!! 




 Another defeat for fundie bigots. But hey, they can still get pizza in Indiana at their favorite place. 




 Let me guess, they are conservative and Christian. 

*checks article*

Yes, yes she is. You can spot em a mile away on issues from race to gender to sexuality. They are like the US version of isis. 




 I dunno, must have won though because he changed topic and said he would just downvote everything I posted. Usually, people do/say things like that when they can't continue the argument and are faced with facts. 

I think he was mad because he said someone else posted the same thing I did and I got a lot of upvotes on it. When I pointed out some things, and even talked to the other person who posted it and they told me it was obvious I posted it first, he got even more upset.

I don't get some of the drama....Been online since BBS days and, at times, reddit seems worse than the old alt.flame wars :) 




 I just try to do something I enjoy each day even though I am in a bad situation. I keep it simple - example from my own life:

I used to make a decent living, would drive across country a few times a year. Out of work, car died and junked, have just about nothing materially - but have a place to stay, food, and the internet. Lots to read, learn, etc. It sucks compared to how it once was - but I have a daughter and we play games and have fun each day.

I listen to the radio, watch movies, and am happy each day my daughter isn't ill and in the hospital. I get no govt aid, don't ever have hope of getting a car again and working (hard to do without a car/etc) - but each and every day I see her smile and we laugh.

 




 You can buy a 10 year supply, for one person, of food (freeze dried) for 12k. I would buy a few of those and lock in the rest on a car and a bomb shelter - just in case a republican wins in 2016 ;) 




 Pretty much no one PM's me. But one guy did, after losing an argument, and said he would follow me and downvote anything I said/posted. 

I think he was serious because I post a lot of things in news/politics and even stories that get way voted up get to zero right after I post them it seems...But, meh, not like karma gets you anything. 

I still find it funny :) I just post for fun and to discuss interesting things with my fellow humans. If I get more Karma than someone do I win something? What am I missing? 




 I was at the theater the night it came out. Midnight showing. Only show my dad and I ever went to together (movies just weren't his thing). IIRC I had school the next day but he knew how much I wanted to see it and took me.

Yeah, it was somewhat of a shock. But one of the things that stuck with me was Han and Leia. We didn't know Luke and her were sister/brother (I think I was 14 at the time, no internet, etc). Why was Leia warming up to Han when it seemed like she and Luke would be together?

Heck, I was ok with the whole Luke/Vader thing, thought Yoda was awesome, but why couldn't Luke get the damned girl? Han had Chewbacca, R2 had 3PO, and luke had...well, not leia it seems.

Of course, being a young man my thoughts were with Leia :) And I used to play with my action figures and it always worked out that Luke and Leia were together. Until Jedi... 




 Over 90% of the terror list is created by Christians in the US.

Weird. 

China, the US, Russia aren't really on that list - but they are the ones supplying arms, starting wars, overthrowing governments, supporting regimes.

When you define who is a 'terror' org what does that really mean anyway? 




 So let me see if I understand this. Hillary has some times to some for profit colleges. Then, instead of giving them (colleges) a pass - she calls them out. Ok. 

What am I missing here? Should she have showered them with glowing praise because someone says she has ties to them? Or is that something conservatives expect because when they are bought and paid for they give such things a pass?
