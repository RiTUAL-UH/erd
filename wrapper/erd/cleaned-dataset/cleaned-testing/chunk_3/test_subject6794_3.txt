 Exactly. It's damned if you do, damned if you don't. Regardless of how you look apparently your eating habits are everybody else's business. I don't get it. 




 I love that video. It's amazing how many people don't get the fact that doing shit like that is offensive until you do it to them. 




 Because asexual people never ever have relationships with anyone ever. /s 




 But there is a difference between finding humor in something you do yourself and someone else making fun of you for having a bodily function that requires ovaries. It's about context. To put it another way, in The Michael J. Fox Show, MJF makes several jokes about his own experiences with Parkinson's, and they are pretty funny. Using humor as a coping mechanism is totally valid, and often hilarious. But if someone else randomly came up to him and said something like "Look at that guy! He keeps twitching like a weirdo, what a cripple! LOLOLOL" you probably wouldn't think this person was funny, you'd call them an asshole. It's not so much the fact that the guy in my story was mentioning periods in a joke that bothered me, but the fact that he was doing it in an incredibly insensitive way. 




 Alright. I'll have to adjust my design then, to make sure there is enough fabric left over to wrap around the rods on either end. Thanks! 




 I recently took up cross stitch, and I plan on making a rather large video game-themed project soon. Rather than frame the completed cross stitch (as per usual with these sorts of things) I would like to make it into a wall scroll. I was wondering if it would be feasible to get some wooden rods and cut them in half, then tuck the fabric inside and glue them back together. Alternatively, I could always just wrap the fabric around the rods and sew it, but I don't know if it will look as neat or be as durable.

What do you guys think? I have rather limited experience with gluing wood, none when it involves fabric. What would be the best way to go about this project? 




 Actually, I would argue that the motion control feature is only marketable if it is mandatory for the console. If you look at the long history of motion control (it goes all the way back to the Atari), it's never done well before the Wii came along. Why? Because motion control was seen as a luxury, an optional accessory. Not that many people are willing to pay the extra money for something like that. This is reinforced by the Kinect and PS motion controls that came out after the Wii. They didn't sell as well, even though the Wii proved that there was a market for motion control, because they were optional accessories that (for most people) didn't add enough to their overall gaming experience with those consoles to be worth the extra money.  




 Honestly I haven't seen the movie, but from what I've been told by people who have it was meant to be seen as ridiculous in the movie. But most of the people who quote it to me in real life are taking it out of context and basically are just using it as a straight-up "LOL GIRLZ HAVE PERIODS LOL PMS LOL" kind of thing. 




 Yes, humor is subjective. But making period jokes is still sexist bullshit. Laughing at women because they menstruate might be "funny" to some people but that doesn't make them less of a douche. 




 In my head-voice I was reading in they were screeching. But to be fair that is merely my imagination and not necessarily an accurate description. 




 I would say no, loving problematic things isn't inherently bad, especially if you are aware of their problematic aspects. Media is made by human beings, and human beings aren't perfect, and often our media reflects the imperfections in our society. But if you had to entirely forgo ANYTHING that had problematic aspects to it, you wouldn't be able to enjoy like 99% of things.

For instance, I love to play video games. I own something like 30 PS3 games, for example. And if I separated them into stacks based on if they had problematic aspects, were neutral, or were really positive for oppressed peoples, those stacks would go from "pretty large" to "we've got a handful here" to "one or two, maybe?"

Does this mean I shouldn't play video games? Of course not. For one thing, you can't criticize something fully until you've actually experienced it. I couldn't very well say that video games are sexist if I never played video games. Also, the more and more women play games and get involved in their development, the more that culture of sexism (and other issues like racism, homophobia, etc.) changes.

So yeah, you can totally enjoy problematic media. Because life isn't about black and white, you absolutely hate it or absolutely love it kind of feelings. It's about ranges and complexity. Of course you're allowed to like movies or tv shows or games that are pretty sexist, but isn't it also true that you get super excited by a movie or show or game that is incredibly positive? For example, I really like Lord of the Rings and I've seen both the Hobbit movies so far. I recognize all the wonderful work that Tolkien put into the series, as well as the efforts of the actors and director and all the production staff for the movies. But when I got into Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire, that became my new favorite medieval fantasy series. Why? Because unlike LotR, GoT acknowledges things like sexism, ableism, and other societal problems and actually gives a pretty diverse range of characters and perspectives.

So don't feel like you're a bad woman or feminist for liking Casablanca. Just as long as you know that it has problems and you're willing to work for a future where we have better media to choose from. 




 No problem :  




 Exactly. The doctor clearly made a mistake, but I fail to see how this is somehow because of some huge trans invasion or some other bull.

Not to mention that trans people constantly have issues with doctors not wanting to recognize their identity - I imagine that most transmen have times where doctors assume they must be a butch lesbian because they wear men's clothes. The butch woman being mistaken for a transman would be the other side of that coin, I suppose. Either way it's still wrong, but there is no need to go around screeching about how trans people and lesbians who date trans women are ruining the butch lesbian identity. :/ 




 Ugh. More trans-exclusionary vitriol.

I totally understand why this woman and her friend that the post was about would be angry that the friend in question was assumed to be trans whenever she was a butch lesbian. That is definitely wrong, and the doctor clearly made a mistake which I believe anyone would be offended about.

However, to read her follow-up response and all of the comments about how trans people are somehow a huge threat to butch lesbian existence ... it honestly made me really sad. Drawing arbitrary gender lines based on physical traits is not going to help us topple the patriarchy. People should be allowed to be who they want to be, regardless of their sexual identity, gender identity, or gender performance. Demonizing trans people only creates more problems for everyone. 




 Probably super random, but it really irks me whenever people quote that Anchorman line about how bears can smell menstruation. Pretty much every time this has happened near me it was some douchebro who thought it was just hilarious that he's making a period joke. The most recent time it happened I actually called the guy on it. He did the quote, a few other guys nearby gave a half-hearted chuckle, and I just straight-faced said to him, "That's not funny."

He tried to make some excuse about how humor is subjective and just because I didn't like the joke didn't mean it wasn't funny. I wasn't about to take that, so I replied "When have you EVER known a woman to laugh at that joke?" That shut him up pretty quick. 




 Good! I hope everything goes well with you, too :D 




 Sounds like you're asexual to me. Being in a relationship with someone or occasionally having sex doesn't disqualify you or anything. And honestly, a lot of queer people have issues with depression/bipolar/anxiety, doesn't make you any less queer. 




 I think it is definitely possible, although it depends on the relationship and what you and your partner do to make it work. My SO and I started dating when we were both 16, and we didn't have sex until we were college freshman at 18. We still have sex fairly regularly, although probably not as often as other couples. I'm pretty neutral toward sex, so I don't mind doing it with him because I see it as just another activity we do as a couple, like going on a dinner date. I enjoy it because I'm doing something with him, although obviously since I'm asexual I don't really get much out of it physically. But we're also in an open relationship so he is able to fulfill his sexual needs with other people as well.

I think the key thing to having a lasting relationship as an adult is that you and your partner communicate openly and frequently and have a lot of trust and understanding for each other. Considering the fact that asexual people are a pretty small minority compared to sexual people, it might be hard to find a partner who is willing to have the sort of relationship you're describing, and even then it will be tough to keep the relationship going. I would suggest talking to your boyfriend about it and seeing what he thinks. Honestly, it's not unrealistic to expect that the person you love will want to make you happy, so I doubt that (assuming he is a decent guy) he will ever want to force you to do anything you don't want to do.

So to answer your question, the future holds a lot of possibilities. It largely depends on you and your partner, but what you want certainly isn't impossible to achieve. 




 Wow, that's so awesome! I'm glad that everyone at your work seems to be cool with it all, and that your mom is supporting you too! I hope things go well with your life from now on, and good luck! : 




 Well obviously if there weren't any out trans people education and awareness would be an issue. However, it is the individual's choice as to whether or not they want to be out. A lot of people go stealth after transitioning because they want people to just consider them the gender that they identify as rather than having "become" that gender or thinking they "aren't actually a man/woman". 




 I think it would be better if we made it safe for trans people to exist first. If there were no horrible consequences for telling someone about your identity then I could understand the resentment over hiding it. But until that point, trans people are still stuck between a rock and a hard place - be forced to hide your identity or face severe, lasting consequences for being out. 




 If I were you I would have said pretty much the same thing.

I hate when people try to frame the discussion about trans people coming out around this idea that it's somehow cis people's right to know exactly what kind of genitals everyone has and if you think that should be private information you're some kind of deceitful asshole. You aren't doing anything wrong by existing as a trans person - if someone pursues you mistaking your gender that's their mistake, and it's really not that big a deal. Hell, if they might even find that they aren't as straight as they think they are. How is that a bad thing? 




 Ugh. This is why I don't come out to doctors. 




 The problem with this, however, is that being trans puts you in a near-constant state of anxiety and danger. There have been so many cases of trans people getting brutally beaten or murdered because they were outed. When a trans person doesn't tell people they're trans, it's not because it might be a "deal-breaker" for some people, they're doing it for survival. 




 It's not really a "may be" at this point, it's fact. The number of states and countries that have legalized marriage equality is growing pretty quickly, but there are much fewer places that have comprehensive human rights protections for trans people. In the US they've been trying to pass federal legislation to make it illegal to discriminate against someone for their sexual orientation or gender identity, but conservatives are having none of that and many people in Congress have been pushing for a compromised version that excludes trans rights. 




 Actually there are more than two sexes - intersex people exist, and pansexual covers attraction to them as well. 




 US here. I say for fuck's sake relatively often, although not nearly as often as fucking hell. 




 I spent easily 5x more time in that level than I should have because I did my best to get rid of every damn block. 




 Well really it's more of a subset of the second one. It might be real but you're not it because once you fall in love with Prince Charming you'll get over it real fast. Because that's how women's sexuality works - you absolutely don't care about sex until you get married and then only for pleasing your husband and having kids. /s 




 In my experience, triggers aren't that predictable. You never really know when it will happen, and it might never go away. I haven't lived with my abuser for almost four years now and I still get anxiety attacks occasionally.

However, talking to a therapist and other survivors about it has helped me gain perspective and practice coping mechanisms for it. So even though the triggers haven't gone away, they don't affect me quite as badly because now I handle them a lot better. So there's that.

As far as moving on, you aren't "supposed" to do anything. You don't just "get over" abuse - it stays with you pretty much forever. But it usually starts to affect you less and less, gradually over time. Just take things at your own pace and do what's healthy for you. Talk to a therapist or abuse counselor if you aren't already. Do things a day at a time. Eventually it will get better. 




 Yeah, this sort of thing is super common and is really shitty. Black women have to deal with so much ridiculousness because of combined racism and sexism, I see it a lot in the southern US where I live. It really makes me want to be a better feminist and activist in general when I find threads like that, because a lot of people are totally clueless about how bad some women of color have it. 




 Mine was pretty fun! I got to hang out with some good friends for most of the weekend, although not much is new with my life. My SO, on the other hand, recently started dating someone he met on OkCupid that goes to our university. She came over Saturday and we all watched anime for a little while, then after I left to go hang with people they got some private time. And they had their first kiss! When I got home my SO was so happy and they're really adorable together so I'm glad things are going really well. : 




 I'm not sure yet. If I made a matching scarf it would be really big and take a lot of time and yarn (Journey scarves make the Fourth Doctor's scarf look like child's play). But I might make a scaled-down version, I dunno. 




 Maybe it only wants to stick around if it's combined with another colors and they can be friends 




 Huh ... not sure how that works, but ok, lol. 




 Well in my experience, freshman tend to be much less mature than upperclassmen (at least if they're not non-traditional students). They're younger and are just starting to gain more freedom from their parents' influence, so they don't always have experience in critical thinking skills or  making decisions for themselves. Therefore they're much more likely to go along with the status quo.

The good news is that in college, a lot of people I know went from being barely tolerable douchebags to actually being really awesome, well-rounded people. So the more you continue on, the better your peer group should get.

IN the mean time, though, just don't worry about the haters. Instead of thinking about the people leaving you as a loss of a friend, try to think of it as removing a person from your life who is not supporting you. Your time is valuable and finite - you shouldn't have to waste time on people who don't have your back. 




 That's what I'm afraid of! I don't want to have to redye it.

So which colors usually last longest, then? 




 /r/genderfluid might be a good place to check out too? 




 That sounds awesome! I've been thinking about doing some strawberry blonde, I've been flirting with the idea of red hair for a while now but I've heard it's really hard to manage compared to other dye colors. 




 I'd love to see it! An album of rainbow hair, lol. It might inspire me to do something fun with my hair :D 




 Generally, unless there is an entirely empty row or the empty seat is next to someone who is physically less threatening to me (isn't bigger than me, is elderly, etc.), I tend to stand. I live in a really sketchy part of town, and depend on public transportation to get where I need to go. This means that I and my roommates have all had various run-ins with people on busses. People have tried to solicit us for sex, tried to sell us drugs, have demanded money, tried to follow us, have sexually harassed us, or have told us we're going to hell for being queer, to name only a few occurrences. So yeah, I tend to just keep to myself as much as possible. Standing means less likely to get hassled. 




 You look so happy and fabulous! I love all your awesome hair colors : 




 I realize why you might want to create such a subreddit and that it might have the potential for doing a lot of good, but to me it seems like it also has way too much potential for abuse and I most likely will not be participating. The reason why existing subs have such strict rules is to create a safe space for oppressed peoples to have discussion; taking away those restrictions makes the space inherently less safe. 




 Actually, the modern definition is there to keep in mind the context in which certain actions happen. If person A and person B walk into a room and person B starts freaking out and refuses to talk to person A and wants to leave, according to your definition of prejudice person B is in the wrong. Why would they randomly do something like that just because of some arbitrary factor of person A's appearance or personality?

But then if you look at the situation in context and find out that person A belongs to a group of people that has systematically abused people like person B, that reaction starts to make a lot more sense. They react negatively to that person not because they are arbitrarily deciding that they don't like them, but because history and lived experience has taught them that being around that person will likely result in bad things happening. It will cause them stress, as well as the potential for physical harm or even death, with little consequences for person A.

To conclude, kids on a reservation not wanting to play with the white children which might hurt their feelings is in no way comparable to the systematic genocide which has been perpetuated against native peoples in the Americas for the last 500+ years. 




 When you invite an abuser and their victim to the same party, that's not a neutral ground. If you tell the victim to be "civil" to their abuser, that's not a neutral ground. Understand?

Exactly this. I wish I could upvote you more than once. 




 Finding more friends is also probably a good idea. I hope everything works out ok for you. Good luck in the future! 




 It's okay, just breathe!

I know that this sort of thing is really nerve-wracking, but perhaps it might help if you focus on something else while waiting for a response? After all, it's not like you can do anything about it until she texts you back, no matter what she says. So try to take a few minutes and relax, do something calming, and worry about what she'll do after she actually does it. 




 I don't think that it's necessarily bad for them to want to participate in the comments, but they shouldn't be overstepping their bounds. Obviously this subreddit is meant to get women's opinions or thoughts on things, so if a bunch of guys answered with their thoughts or opinions all the time it would kind of defeat the point.

Of course, I still think they should be allowed to respond to women's answers. Like if they wanted to compare a response they see to their own observations, or ask for more details, or even just to say "TIL".

So yeah, basically as long as they don't try to take over the subreddit it shouldn't be too big of an issue. 




 Non-transitioning transwoman still means you're a woman. I would say it's actually pretty important for you to answer so that we have different perspectives. If straight white cis women were the only people who responded to questions people would get incomplete or even misleading answers sometimes, so really your responses could be very helpful! 




 That's a really tough position to be in. I've also had issues with people I'm really good friends with then getting SOs and kind of ignoring everyone else. This isn't an issue with you necessarily, but more likely an issue with your friend and her bf. A lot of people fall into the trap of hanging out almost exclusively with their partner to the detriment of their other relationships. It happens.

Honestly, to me it seems like her bf is a little too controlling. If he was getting super jealous and making a fuss over her hanging out with you, it's possible he twisted her arm until she caved and stopped hanging out with you to make him feel more comfortable. That's pretty stupid, especially since you don't seem to be romantically interested in her, just really good friends. If that is what happened, bad on him for being really possessive and bad on her for not standing up to him.

It's also possible that they're just going through a kind of honeymoon phase since they just got to move in together. If he lived farther away before and they didn't get to see each other that often, it's only natural that she would want to hang out with him a lot now that she has the opportunity, but she takes you for granted because you've always been close by. That will start to fade at some point, though. It's really hard to only hang out with your SO for extended periods of time.

My advice is to just wait this out for a little while. If your friend continues to ignore you in favor of her SO, try to talk to her about it. If she really cares for you she'll probably try to hang out with you at least a little more, regardless of what her boyfriend says. Also, it may or may not help to talk to this bf and tell him that you're not trying to steal her away and make her your gf or anything, but this girl is a close friend and it sucks that he's monopolizing all her time. She should be able to socialize with whomever she wants. 




 I'd say that you sound like someone who is bi- or homoflexible-romantic ace. Really that's up to you. Of course, lots of people who identify as gay or otherwise queer have had hetero relationships in the past and truly liked the person(s) they were with. But sometimes you just realize that sort of thing isn't what you prefer. That's okay.

FYI, lots of bi people (ace or otherwise) have a preference for one gender. I've known bi people who were physically attracted to one gender and romantically attracted to another, or who preferred one gender but didn't mind dating or having sex with people who weren't that gender. You don't have to like everyone equally to be biromantic. Really though the label is more about what you're comfortable with and what you want to communicate to other people about yourself, so if you're at the point where you don't really want to be with men then identifying as homoromantic is fine. 




 Yes. This happens to me a lot.

Of course, I'm fairly masculine and often cross-dress so most people read me as "butch lesbian." I have short hair, I hang out with a lot of dudes, I love action movies and play video games ... I guess I fit a lot of the stereotypes that people assume apply to lesbians.

Strangely, though, people will often assume that I'm straight if they meet me with my SO, who is male. So with new people it often goes either way. Meet us as a couple, I'm a straight tomboy. Meet me by myself, I'm a butch lesbian. Meanwhile I just go "you're all wrong but it will take way too much effort to correct you so whatever." 




 I had to read through a lot of stuff for my epidemiology class last semester about this sort of thing. According to the CDC, it's a problem because people demand antibiotics for everything (they were marketed as a magic bullet for decades) and doctors cave in, plus with factory farms and whatnot we're pumping our animals full of antibiotics and then you get MRSA.  




 There's also the "you just haven't found the right person yet" argument. I've heard that one soooooo many times. 




 My personal experience with other queer people has been pretty similar to yours. Other GSM people have only been slightly more likely to be aware of asexuality compared to straight people I've come out to. And I've had more than my share of people tell me that it's not really a thing and I'm just trying to be a "special snowflake" and I'm taking attention away from the "real" queers. It sucks. But fortunately not everyone is like that. 




 Well speaking as a kid who was adopted, it's less about who your parents are and more about the fact that they love you. There are tons of kids in foster care who need to be adopted into loving homes. By adopting you are giving that kid a new chance at a life they wouldn't have otherwise. That doesn't suddenly change because you're gay.

I'm glad someone else was able to help you find UK-related info! 




 Well usually I would say yes, it is possible, because lots of asexual people have sex with their partners, myself included, with relatively few issues. However, if you've already tried lubes, foreplay, etc. and you are still having issues, it's probably time to talk to a doctor. It's possible that there's something going on with your body if penetrative sex isn't going well, so it's probably a good idea to talk to a gyno just in case. 




 But there was also another episode where they got caught in nightmares manufactured by Doctor Destiny (John Dee - also I loved the historical reference for that character). Flash's nightmare was that he was so fast everyone else just stopped moving. He became isolated because he was just too fast for other people. So I'd say it's probably still something he thinks a lot about. 




 I just rewatched all of the Justice League cartoon. The number of times where Batman must think "fuck, uh, hang on ... lemme pull out my gadgets" whenever all the other members just decide to fly/run super fast to get somewhere was a lot higher than I remembered from my childhood days. 




 Yes. It seems like a lot of anime these days just uses blatant fan-service to get ratings, and it is sooooooo tiring. So few shows are willing to go without unnecessary or nonsensical gratuitous T A anymore.

Literally the only show I can think of that I've watched recently without any fan service or vapid female characters is Attach on Titan. That's it. 




 That's rough. I recommend a nice nap. 




 Honestly, I don't get it either. You can still have a fantastic, memorable event without having to spend tens of thousands of dollars. That's just ridiculous. You don't need a $15,000 dress. You don't need caviar or expensive alcohol. You don't need a lot of the nonsense that some people have at their weddings. It's basically just a show of financial status these days more than a celebration of love for a lot of people. But in ten or twenty years, that won't matter - no one will really care how much money you spent on your wedding. What's important is that you and your family and friends all got together and made some memories. 




 Who says that museums aren't entertaining? I love looking at different pieces of history. 




 Thanks for such a well-written response. Honestly, I don't go to the library as much as I used to, but when I was a kid it was one of my favorite places to go. I've always been a huge reader, and I didn't have money for a tablet or ereader (or even new books, really) so the library helped me get access to all sorts of books. It definitely improved my quality of life - most of the things I know I know from reading, and it gave me a good head start in school that I otherwise wouldn't have had.

Plus, there is an important social component to libraries. Like you said, they are community spaces. I would often go to the library to hang out with friends after school. They often have workshops where you can learn new skills, or book clubs where you can meet people with common interests. It's a lot harder to get that sort of thing for free on the internet - people who live near you that can give you that sort of experience. Not to say that forums and chat rooms can't do similar things, but I don't think that interaction online will ever fully replace interaction in the real world.

Also, the library policy changes made after 9/11 just proves how awesome libraries are, at least imho. 




 As far as the kids thing goes, it's not impossible. I don't know how adoption laws work in the UK but that seems like a pretty viable option. Of course if you wanted your own biological child and had some money you could use a donor egg and surrogate mom. So you should tell your mom that grandkids aren't completely out of the picture.

On the other hand, you still have the issue that same sex relationships "make her feel ill." Honestly, this is kind of silly, but a lot of straight people have the homophobic tendency to be a little squeamish about gay couples. Hopefully, though, she'll get over it with time, especially if she realizes that there really isn't a reason to be squeamish and if she sees you being happy in a relationship.

A support group would probably be a good idea for your parents, or at least your mom. Again, I don't live in the UK so I don't know any specifics, but you should try searching on the internet for an LGBTQ organization in your area. They can likely help you out with finding resources for your parents, possibly a support group, or even just talking to them - they're probably more practiced at it than you are and they might be able to give your parents some perspective. Plus, it always helps to hear it from multiple people.

Other than that, just keep doing what you've been doing. Answer their questions and show them you love them. Your parents seem like they're just worried about you, but once they get used to the fact that you're gay they probably won't worry as much about it.

I hope that helps, and good luck! 




 I'm glad that you feel better about yourself! No, there is nothing wrong with you. You're just like the rest of us : 




 Wow, what a dirtbag. It's totally okay to be bothered by someone saying shitty things about you, regardless of how immature and stupid they are. Just remember that it's better to not respond, because that kind of moron is only going to hurl more and more insults at you. 




 I'd say that ultimately joining is up to you. I've found that the LGBTQ organizations on my campus are nice to go to if for no other reason than to have people I can talk to about being queer. Although there aren't that many aces on campus that are also active in the groups, it does help a little to be around other people who you know are more likely to be aware of your identity and less likely to judge you for it (although there are still some people who can be just as nasty as the rest of the heteronormative world).

If you don't think you'll get any good out of it, though, there's not much of a point in joining. If I were you I'd at least try it out for a little while just to see if I'd like it or not, but I wouldn't say it's unreasonable to not want to. 




 they group sets of believes and people subscribe to all of them, without judging each individual one on their merits

This is not true. That's why each broader movement has so many different subgroups. People are individuals, not hive-minds. No label is perfect, nor does any one person truly fit perfectly with that label.

Also, your description of what feminists "generally" do is merely a generalization. I've had many, many discussions with people where they were willing to debate or answer questions, and I always make an effort to do so unless someone is deliberately being offensive. Although, it is true that further discussion is often easier whenever someone is at least somewhat familiar with theory, thus feminists (or any other person with extensive knowledge in a topic) will often recommend reading to people who are interested in finding out more.

I can't speak for all feminists or the entire movement, but the way I try to approach things is to try to work with people to create awareness of problems, find solutions, and work toward a common goal. It's not about who is superior, because no one is truly superior, at least not in the sense that you're using the word. What's more important is that people learn from one another; sometimes I am teaching other people, but just as often I learn new things as well. No one knows anything, so anyone who thinks that they're superior to everyone else has a flawed personality or worldview.

That's my two cents, anyhow. 




 Well the point that I was trying to make is that trans people are more likely to experience societal privileges as long as no one knows they're trans, either before they ever come out/start transitioning or after they've fully transitioned and go stealth. Of course, even after transitioning a lot of trans people still have to deal with a lot of stuff, especially if they get outed. 




 Yep. People tend to assume I'm a lesbian all the time when they meet me. And I've gotten a lot of the "you probably just haven't met the right one yet" line more than a few times. 




 Gay guys that do that drive me crazy. Seriously, it's okay that you're not into vaginas. But you really don't need to go around constantly talking about how disgusting you think they are. It's not like there's a magical vagina fairy that can wave a wand and make them all pretty so they sparkle or shoot rainbows. We don't get to wish on a star and magically transform our bodies to please everyone. Jeez. 




 Yeah, there's that ... one of my good friends used to joke that Seed/Destiny were basically just really long toy commercials, because allllll the model kits. 




 Trust me, you're not missing much. You would only rage at her more as the series went on. 




 Seed and seed destiny were pretty terrible in general, let's be honest. 




 That's a good idea. I'll save up a bit and check it out. 




 Well I am, and I call myself a feminist. I understand why a lot of people have issues with it but really the only way to fix the movement is from within, so refusing to call yourself a feminist just because you don't agree with some feminists isn't really effective, at least imho. To each their own, though. 




 Same. Also, whenever I was watching Seed Destiny there was a character that I pretty much instantly hated and couldn't figure out why until I realized they used the same voice actress for both characters. 




 Good! I'm glad I could help. : 




 I'm so jealous! I've always wanted to do loom-weaving but I would never be able to afford a large loom like that. The most I can manage is a tiny bead loom ... 




 Same! I just love to hate Dio. His rivalry with Jojo is just too delicious to watch. 




 Flay Allster, from Gundam Seed.

On top of being incredibly racist, she is pretty much the culmination of every negative stereotype about women ever. She uses her body to make connections with powerful men to get what she wants (while cheating on her fiance). She flaunts her body to get attention. She's emotionally manipulative. She's completely fucking useless every time they're in battle and just goes running to some boy crying for protection. Oh, and she very nearly manages to fuck up several battles and almost the entire war for her side.

She is literally the worst character in any anime I've ever seen. 




 Thanks for the link! It's a pretty good one.

I really like that the speaker brought up the blog quotes talking about how just because you're not trying to get in a woman's pants doesn't automatically make you a feminist. I've talked to so many women who have had gay guys critically comment on their appearance, touch or grope their bodies without permission, etc. but when they tell them no the man will respond "oh, it's okay, I'm gay, it's not like I want to have sex with you." 

Seriously, just because you aren't physically attracted to someone doesn't mean it's okay for you to say that they're ugly, or tell them their genitals are nasty, or to fondle their breasts or ass. That shit is not cool. 




 Honestly, though, the academic discourse isn't even the problem so much as their misapplication of it - the idea that having a penis gives you privilege is true, even in the case of trans women, because for at least some portion of their lives trans women are raised as male. So while they are living as male, they do have privileges women don't. But that changes once they start to transition because people start to perceive them as female. If people assume you have a vagina they will treat you like they treat anyone else with a vagina. And this is what makes it so hard for trans women - they're getting misogyny from people, and if they don't pass well or are outed they have to deal with transmisogyny too.

But for some reason radfems can't see this. Having a penis doesn't mean you are always perceived as male, and unless you are perceived as male by society you won't get the privileges associated with having a penis.

Also, yes, you are the absolute worst kind of dick of you shit on trans people in the name of female solidarity. 




 Most of the changes that I liked were really small, because I appreciate subtlety. But I think that one of my favorites is probably the alterations to Tyrion and Sansa's wedding.

In the books, we view the wedding from Sansa's POV, so we're getting all of her internal thought processes throughout the ceremony. During the whole affair we read how humiliating and traumatizing this is for her. At one point she was promised to Joffrey, the prince of the kingdom, whom she assumed was as gallant as all the stories made knights out to be. Then he executed her father and viciously abused her, as well as making most of the knights she would have gone to for help complicit in that abuse. She was deemed practically untouchable after her father was declared "traitor," and she ends up being handed off to Tyrion, who is quite possibly the most insulting marriage proposal she could possibly be given. Not only is he a Lannister (therefore an enemy of her family), he is her abuser's uncle (so she will never be rid of him), and to top it all off he's a dwarf (which everyone in the kingdom seems more than happy to ridicule him for).

Understandably, Sansa is not happy about the situation. But she's also made it this far by the fact that she's pretty much gone along with whatever tortures the Lannisters think up for her. If she objects, she could very well be the next to die. But she can't just take it. So she fights back in what little way she can - by refusing to bow to allow Tyrion to cloak her as part of the ceremony. In her mind, she is refusing to debase herself further in an already terrible situation. Eventually, Tyrion is forced to climb on someone's back to finish the cloaking.

However, this scene only works when told from Sansa's POV. If the scene played out the same way in the show, all we would get out of it would be Sansa, for some inexplicable reason, suddenly deciding to be an asshole to Tyrion, a character that everyone seems to like considerably more than her. It would not do well in the show since we don't have access to Sansa's thoughts and reasoning for doing such a thing.

So rather than try to make the scene work as it exists, they changed it for the show, and I think it was a masterful stroke. This time around, Tyrion had a step stool placed so that he could easily reach Sansa's shoulders for the cloaking, but Joffrey being the sadistic scum that he is decides to pull it away at the last second. Then Sansa bows so he can cloak her. I love how they decided to change the scene, because it takes care of all the issues presented by portraying it from an outside rather than first-person perspective while still keeping everyone in character. In the show version we have Joffrey being a dick rather than Sansa being the one who is humiliating Tyrion, which means we don't have people feeling conflicted or irritated with Sansa when they're supposed to be relating to her. Instead, we just hate Joffrey more, which only helps the story along. Plus, we have Sansa witnessing how Joffrey tortures Tyrion just like he tortures her - this is a good setup for their later relationship. Eventually Sansa comes to like and trust Tyrion a little, despite her wariness over his lineage, because she can relate to how he suffers and realizes that he's not nearly as bad as his father, sister, or nephew. By having Joff humiliate Tyrion at the wedding, Sansa can immediately relate to her new husband; this means she's still in character as well, despite the contradicting actions her character takes in the book to movie transition.

I know that I wrote a lot about something so tiny but speaking as someone who loves literature and has studied theater techniques I just really appreciate what they did in the show to this particular scene. 




 I'm sure that Ned would have fought for himself if he was healthy, but considering he'd been injured fighting Jaime there's no way that would happen. Ned is honorable, but not suicidal. Given the chance he might have named a champion, but we'll never know because that's not the way it went down. 




 You know, I never caught that. Although I haven't discovered anything else to confirm or deny whether or not Varys heard the conversation, it would be really interesting if he had. It certainly has some interesting implications for how Ned's betrayal turned out. 




 You didn't format your spoiler properly ... might want to fix that. 




 There is unfortunately an entire subreddit dedicated to this stuff. It made me weep for feminists and women everywhere ... 




 To be fair, not all feminists think that way - in fact, third-wave feminism focuses on intersectionality and is a lot more inclusive to queer women, women of color, and other minority groups than feminism has ever been in the past. The blog post OP linked to represents one radical sect of feminism, and those views are not shared by everyone in the movement, any more than trans-exclusion is practiced by everyone in the queer rights movement. 




 TERFs are probably one of the worst things to ever come out of the feminist movement. It's so disgusting. A lot of their rantings sound very similar to the KKK's arguments about race traitors and whatnot. Trans women are not threatening other women, they often have it worse than cis women do. Radfems who cannot seem to understand that ... it makes me so sad and angry. Everything would be so much better for all of us if women would stop acting like this and actually band together to help out ALL women, not just the women who are like them. 




 I honestly have no idea why so many gynos are men ... it's weird. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that there are fewer female doctors in general, I dunno. 




 For most of my life I didn't know anyone else who was openly asexual, although I wasn't entirely open about it either.

However, when I started college I moved to the only city that (at the time) was the only one in the state that had passed comprehensive anti-discrimination laws for queer people (including trans*, which is still really uncommon). For those of you who live in the U.S., I live in a state that has been red for the last four elections. For everyone else, it's pretty much conservative except in a few major cities.

The result of this legislation, though, is that my city has a comparatively huge population of GRSM people. My school has a large and very active queer student activity center and activism group. And I now know probably 5x as many queer people as I used to in high school, at least.

This has included several ace people. My current roommate and his partner identify as ace or demi, a friend of mine from a school club is ace, and after coming out on facebook I found out that a friend from my high school days is ace as well. We've had a lot of conversations about identity and ace issues, and it's been really great. For my entire childhood I felt isolated and lonely because literally none of my friends knew how I felt. Now, I have people I can turn to that understand how I feel about romance, sex, relationships, etc. without me having to explain a totally new concept to them.

It hasn't always gone well, however. There have still been some people who, after I tell them about my identity, have claimed to feel the same way and then it later turned out they weren't being entirely honest. One person in particular lied to his partner (whom I was good friends with) and said he was asexual merely to avoid having sex with him. When my friend later found out about the lie and told me about it I was pretty upset. This person used my identity as an excuse to get out of something, when telling the truth would have been easier anyway, and then tried to make out like he was the victim. Ugh. It's hard enough to get people to take me seriously when I tell them about asexuality - there are so many who are willing to dismiss me by saying I can't or don't actually feel that way. People like him who fake it just make things so much worse. 




 Telling them you're asexual might be difficult, but telling them you're not interested isn't nearly as hard. A lot of guys don't want to hear that, though, and just ignore what you say unfortunately ... 




 How do you prevent any domestic abuse from happening? Like I said, problematic situations come up in any marriage, not just polygamy. The only way to prevent exploitation is to have a bunch of decent human beings get together. You can't argue that polygamy is a huge issue for exploitation and therefore we shouldn't have it because monogamous relationships have the exact same potential for exploitation. Unless you want to get rid of marriage or relationships altogether this sort of thing will happen. The only way to change it is to change patriarchal attitudes, which a lot of people in modern polyamorous relationships are already doing.

And really you don't have to make tons of extra laws and regulations. Every partner involved in a polygamous marriage would have the same rights as any other married couple. 




 Oh, good! I would hate to be sick on a holiday. I hope you feel all better really soon! 




 The most I've ever had in one sitting is two drinks, so I've never had issues with hangovers. I do not envy you there. Honestly I have just as much fun watching other people get drunk and be silly as other people have fun getting drunk, so I never felt a huge need to drink too much.

Still, it seems like you would have been okay with only three shots and that much food. 




 Oh jeez. That's not good. Did someone else buy drinks and put them on your tab or something? I imagine it's hard for one person to drink over $500 worth of alcohol in one night ... 




 Those sorts of issues aren't inherent to polygamous relationships, however. Also, not all polygamy is polygyny (multiple women with one male partner) - there are also historical situations in which polyandry was common and in fact beneficial.

Really, though, in Western patriarchal society, marriage PERIOD is oppressive to women. So as we improve marriage in general, polygamous marriages are improved.

Plus, I really don't see the point in arguing that because something is harder or more complicated we shouldn't do it. Of course poly relationships require more effort and are more complicated than relationships with only two people. Large extended families also tend to be more difficult to manage and more complex than families with single or no children. That doesn't mean people shouldn't have five or six kids if they have the means, or that three or more generations of a family can't live together. There are plenty of situations in which poly groups are just as good or even better than the "traditional" nuclear family, despite being more complex. To use an analogy, if we were talking about math you wouldn't say that we shouldn't teach calculus to anyone because it's more complicated and harder than simple addition, would you?

Really this isn't a matter of something being bad because it's complicated, it's a matter of everyone doing what's right for them. For some people, that happens to be polyamory and polygamy. For others, it's monogamy. 




 I love how this guy is describing polygamy like it would be the most awful ridiculous thing ever, but in reality it sounds kind of nice. I totally wouldn't mind if my primary partner and I and anyone else we bring into our relationship could all live together in one big happy group marriage. 




 Hello, everyone! How was your New Year's Eve?

Mine was rather eventful. I just happened to start my shark week yesterday (ugh) and I have really awful cramps, especially on the first day. Then on top of that my SO wanted to go to this party where I basically knew him and one other guy (he'll be M) at all well. I'd also met a lot of the other attendees but I only see them once in a while and I certainly wouldn't consider them friends but more like acquaintances. I'm the type of person that likes to hang out with people I know well at large parties, so I'm usually uncomfortable when I only have one or two friends but everyone else knows each other really well. So I assumed that I would most likely be miserable for most of the night.

Instead, I actually had a lot of fun! I was probably the only person who didn't drink much - I had a small glass of champagne and just had soda the rest of the night (didn't want to feel drunk icky on top of period icky). Everyone else seemed to be having a good time for the most part. I had some really great conversations with people that I didn't know that well, which was really fun and unexpected.

Then a few people got a little too drunk ... or maybe a lot. Our one friend (let's call him T) had apparently started drinking before coming to the party we were at, and had quite a bit while we were there, so he was pretty wrecked. He threw up Linda Blair style all over like three other people. They were obviously upset but took it all in stride and started a mini shirtless guy party, so much fun was still had by all. Well, M ended up taking care of T while he prayed to the porcelain god, so I stayed downstairs and chatted with M's girlfriend, C. Then C ended up getting sick too, although not so sick she passed out like T did ... poor guy.

I can't say I expected to spend two or so hours holding back some girl's hair that I barely knew as part of my New Year's celebrations, but I don't really regret it. C is really nice, and we ended up getting along really well despite the puking. We kinda bonded last night, and the four of us (my SO, C, M, and I) all agreed to hang out more in the future, sans alcohol.

That said, I hope that the rest of you had fun ushering in the new year, and that nobody got seriously hurt while drinking. Just remember that you have to watch your friends and make sure to take care of each other so that no one drinks too much or get hurt. Nobody wants to make a hospital visit on NYE. 




 Unfortunately, even gay men often think that they are entitled to power over women's bodies. In this case, this dude thinks he is entitled to rating your physical appearance. I would say that is definitely rude, regardless of his sexuality. His opinion was not asked for, nor did it need to be given. 




 Don't worry, it's totally normal to be worried about this sort of thing. Since you're worried about pain, I assume you're female-bodied? Or are you concerned about hurting a female-bodied partner? Either way, I'll try to give you some tips.

1. Don't have sex before you're ready. This should seem obvious, but a lot of teens are pressured into doing something that they later regret. I'm not going to tell you that you absolutely shouldn't have sex until you're older (although 15 is a little young, and can have legal implications depending on where you live and the age of your partner). However, if you want to have sex you should make sure that you're doing it because it's what you want, not because you feel obligated to or your partner wants you to do it.

2. Just because you aren't "turned on" by someone in general doesn't mean that your body won't have a physiological response to sexual situations. Even as an ace, if someone touches you, you will most likely experience some parts of physical arousal - for instance, if you are female bodied you will still lubricate or "get wet." This is something that happens regardless of sexual desire - women's bodies have evolved to be that way in case of sexual trauma so that they aren't severely hurt. So if you are concerned about lubrication, this will most likely not be an issue, although if it is you can still use artificial lubricant.

3. This leads to your comment about condom/lube use. [This link](http://www.healthyhorns.utexas.edu/hs_lube.html) has some quick tips for combinations of condoms and lube. You can buy these sorts of things online or in any drug store. Just make sure to read all instructions carefully to make sure that you are using each product correctly, and that combining them won't cause issues - usually a lube will have a label saying if it is safe for use with latex condoms. I would highly recommend using a condom, even if you or your partner is using other forms of birth control, to reduce the risk of infections or STDs. Safer sex every time means you develop good habits and have less risk in the future!

4. Go slowly. Especially if it is your first time having sex. Instead of jumping straight into penetrative sex, take a little bit of time to kiss and touch with your partner. You can then move on to manual stimulation or oral sex. This will help for a lot of reasons - first, it will help you become more familiar with your partner and get more comfortable with them. Second, it can help you become more physically relaxed and receptive to sex. If you have vaginal sex, it allows for more time to produce enough lubrication. Once you do start having penetrative vaginal or anal sex, you should still go slowly at first. For someone who is female-bodied, it will most likely be uncomfortable or even slightly painful at first if you have an unbroken hymen. If at any point you or your partner experiences moderate/high amounts of pain, stop right away. Sex should never hurt that badly (unless you want it to).

5. Once you become sexually active, you should make sure to tell your doctor. If you are female-bodied, this often also means starting to see a gynocologist. Most doctors recommend that you start seeing a gyno when you are 18 or if you are sexually active, whichever comes first. This is important for your continued sexual health - going to see your gyno for regular pap smears ensures that you don't have any issues, and the gyno can also answer any questions you have about sex or sexual health and address any issues you might have.

I hope that answers a lot of the questions you have so far. If you want to know anything else, shoot me a reply or a message. This was just generic info that would be helpful for anyone but I can also tell you more about my personal experience if you're interested. 




 To answer your initial question, no, being transexual does not mean you have the sexuality of the opposite sex. It means that your gender does not align with your physiological sex. Those are two very different things.

If you feel like you should have a vagina or breasts or that you are too hairy, etc. that is called gender dysphoria. You feel like the current state of your body doesn't quite match up with what should be there, right? I'd say that's a pretty big sign you're trans. Of course, you should probably talk to a queer-friendly counselor about this - they can help you better understand those feelings and you can discuss the possibility of transitioning with them.

As far as having a lot in common with gay men, I don't see anything particularly wrong with that. Personally, I'm female but I usually relate a lot more easily to guys because I'm fairly masculine. That doesn't invalidate my womanhood or identity. You're allowed to like what you like - no two women are the same, and there is no one "right" way to be female. Plus, peeing standing up is a pretty useful skill, especially if you don't have a toilet handy while camping or what have you.

So don't worry too much about that sort of thing! I hope that clears some things up for you, and I hope that you figure out your identity and find happiness in the future. 




 The first time I went to see a gyno, my mom told me to go to the guy she sees, but she had to work that day so she had her mom (my grandma) take me. It was then that grandma told me that not only does she also see the same gyno, but he delivered me. And he also delivered my mom. So basically this dude has been around to see three generations of my family's vagina. 




 Wow. After reading through some of these comments I'm a bit disappointed. There are a lot of people on here who don't seem to understand the idea that cross-dressing can be another form of gender expression and you don't have to be MTF or FTM transgender in order to want to dress differently. Some people just feel more comfortable or that they look better wearing different clothes. Why is it such a huge issue that a man wants to wear dresses and makeup but still be a man? THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF QUEER MKAY
