 Grind and polish it down, then engrave. 




 Did you eat the bastard?  




 Comcast.  I don't care if they have a "monopoly", shouldn't the government or some other company come in with a takeover?  




 Now that's something a five year old can understand!  




 Looks like OP got it wrong.  




 I was going to reply that all men want blow jobs for Valentines Day, but this answer is much better  




 I live in a suburb of Chicago, and our plow drives don't give two shits. They have a schedule to keep and they aren't slowing down to give our driveways a break.  Slightly different subject, but I've seen cars that are under tons of packed snow, slush, and ice.  




 This.  I already clear my drive way to the right (flow of traffic) and part of the road (so i can get in and out of the driveway), but my driveway is always full of snow again when the plow comes through.  




 The problem is some people CAN'T get vaccinated, due to being too young, too sick with something else, or allergic.  It's the people that CHOOSE that are putting the people that CAN'T in danger.  




 That's the point of getting vacancies, so you don't get said diseases.   




 Do you want to drive in the road with uninsured drivers?  




 I don't know why, but the last line made me genuinely laugh out loud.  




 The other day = within the last year 




 I like how the show seems to be taking a slightly different path than the books.  




 Do you want spoilers? Because that is how you get spoilers.  




 If you think that really fixed your problem, you're going to have a bad time.  




 Shut down or not, the core needs a constant supply of water to keep it cool.  No water being pumped in, the core will overheat and meltdown.  Source - Life After People.  




 Nuclear power plant melt down.  Without constant maintenance, every single one of those plants are ticking time bombs.  




 I hope you fall deeply in love, then get cheated on, and catch an STD.    




 Drugs are bag, mkay. 




 When i delivered pizza I did that shit all the time.  




 No, fuck you.  




 My wife got a $400 dye job and hair cut, so I got a $400 putter.  




 Looks painful. But why is he smiling?  




 All that, and in the end, i would say it was a failed attempt.  I want my six and a half minutes back.  




 Why doesn't Bob get fired for stealing in both cases?  




 Lots of people don't know that it's then coolant that also provides the heat.  If your coolant isn't good, neither is the heat.  




 An O2 sensor is a pretty hardy device, and they don't go bad that often. If you're getting a bad signal from the O2 sensor, it means you have an emissions problem.  Changing the sensor isn't going to fix anything.  




 I always tell people, a bad signal doesn't mean a bad O2 sensor. 




 Chicago land? We could use a second.  




 I see a cartoon old fashion steam train. 




 I always wonder how people this dumb survived on their own.  




 I told my wife that i jerk off once a day (at least), if she doesn't want me to masterbate then she should do something about it everyday, if not, live with it.  




 Eat some and find out. 




 I was a little sick, and taking a piss when i felt a fart coming on... 




 I'd watch it.  




 Bush haters don't want to hear this.  




 I thought the people didn't have Internet.  So what does the government care if they use up all the bandwidth?  




 Not fancy, ST.  It's the sport addition, part of the old SVT racing team.  




 You don't know anything about the ST, do you?  




 The Focus ST comes with these seats, so why not get a matching baby seat.  




 How else do you brine a whole pig?  




 Yeah, but he got kicked out of the band for doing too much LSD. 




 Fuck you. That is all.  




 Love that movie.  I use that quote all the time irl, and no one gets it.  




 Very dangerous if you're driving around with munitions strapped to the top of your boat... 




 Do you want hate mail? This is how you get hate mail.  




 Just because it's legal, doesn't mean it's Ok.  




 What do you mean, "if"? They clearly are.  




 Who cares what the guy wants, some chick wants to fuck.  




 What state? I want to make a note to avoid that and all the states that touch that state. And maybe the ones that touch those... 




 How is this person still alive? I'm picturing a person who can't figure out how to get food in their mouth.   




 Pcp is a hell of a drug.
