 Longest headshot or longest headshot on a chopper pilot? 




 I live in an apartment, alone, in wichita, ks, and if I made even $20,000 a year it would cover everything for me. That would include car, insurance, tuition, rent, food (the highest cost for someone with my appetite), internet, electricity, and phone. Anything more than that and I could freely spend it on anything. Granted my apartment may be a bit drab to some, and I don't drink, and I don't need fancy things to be happy. I'm still shooting for ~100k for my career salary, but that's for financial security. 




 Your trolling is successful! I don't even play the game, and I still hate you. Keep up the good work! 




 My apologies, I don't know the rules to reddit, and I'm on my my phone always so I can't read them. What does it matter anyway?  




 Your fun fact made me sad. That shouldn't be a fun fact.. 




 Was this a parody/joke they were doing for the class? Or were they serious? 




 Fun fact: The particles that we *smell* are not the same as the actual particles. So smelling poop does not mean there is poop floating in your nose. Reddit taught me that! 




 Best way to do it is by uploading your image to imgur.com, which is in itself very simple, then paste that link 




 I'm level 30 and I play *lite* hours, on regular servers. If you play those 1750 ticket metros even 3 or 4 times a week, you'll easily be up there pretty fast, assuming you have some sort of skill.  




 Like if it rolled on its back and I wanted to tickle its belly, it would slice the flesh off my fore arms. I see.. 




 Well I'd have a conversation. Haha that was my problem. I was always as friendly as I could be, and I was tipped generously for it, but when you wonder why you don't have your drinks yet, it's because you told me the story about how you became the prince of bel air, and I just can't be in two places at once. You just don't tell the customer to their face that you don't have time to talk to them. 




 Well that is unfortunate. I would really like a lion cub or two to spruce up the apartment, but I'm definitely not trained to handle that. Thanks for the reply! 




 I saw that post with the picture of the lion cub in the front seat of taco bell guy's car, and had this question. If I raised my own lion cub from birth to adulthood, is it DNA-wired to be a predator? Would it eat birds and my neighbors cats and eventually my annoying neighbors when it is an adult? Or would it only act as I trained it, so it could just be my really frightening looking house cat? 




 This will sound weird, but please don't try to be my friend if the restaurant is full. I usually had five tables minimum, and if you literally talk to me for five minutes about my life or yours, that's great, but it throws off my entire night, because I keep a flawless routine. Come in later when we are slow if you want my life story, that's when I'm glad to give it 




 That's entirely personal. People not stacking plates drove me absolutely insane when I was a waiter. The conglomeration of trash and plates spread over the table always took longer to clean then whatever the kind customer did for me. I think it's better for the server to be more flexible in handling what is given to them. 




 To all current or future Subway employees:

*Coat* the bread rolls in herbs, don't just dip one side in, they're so much better that way.

Proof to about 13", they shrink when they bake.

Always wipe excess cheese off the baking forms, it'll save *literally* hours of cleaning later

Last, bake them so that they're light brown, still visibly green from the herbs, and the cheese isn't burnt. You all suck at this part a lot and the bread tastes awful because of it.

I was a Sandwich Artist at Subway, and I put the art in artist. 




 This was the answer I was looking for. I figured it was just a mirror of some sort, but I didn't give it a close look, and it looked completely real. Thanks for this.

Edit: Look at the base of the flag for example. How is that being done? That's not a mirrored image, and I don't see any other part of the image that it could have been taken from. 




 I've never used photoshop before in my life, and I'm 20 years old. I saw [this gif](http://arixev.deviantart.com/art/Diablo-3-Act-2-Wallpaper-How-i-made-it-307916030) today and thought, how is this even happening? Do pictures like the character loading screen have multiple layers, so that you can crop out the character's layer and the background image will exist beyond it? I know photoshop uses layering and other magic like that, but I need more explanation. 




 I get it! The clown is deaf! Right?? Guys? 




 Mine forgets where the AC vents are everyday, and when she finally finds them again she gets super excited and decides that she is the only one allowed to have air conditioning after that. 




 Pretty much any day I would open the freezer door when I first got my husky, she would sit in it at the bottom just like this. She still tries and she is massive 




 It's the tinfoil-hat comments that make me realize I have no idea what is going on 80% of the time here on Reddit.

You have negative downvotes, while people usually have positive downvotes.  




 Excited, excited, EXCITED.

Then you let me down. I'm gonna go with, you say it means nothing so I don't investigate more, and uncover a truth you don't want me to. This isn't over. 




 I'm new to reddit and the RES as well, but why does your karma say (2|-1)? Is that not the same as (3|0)? What is happening? 




 I want to downvote you for trying to do something heinous, but I also want to upvote you for possibly actually believing that you would appreciate that more than me.

And, kittensngravy, that would be awesome, but I cannot ask that of you. Thank you anyway!

 I would give up my first born to have a shiny Scyther/Scizor. You are awesome.
