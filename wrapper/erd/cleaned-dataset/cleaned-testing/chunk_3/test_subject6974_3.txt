 I got detention once for simply roaming the hall without a pass. Mind you - there were a dozen other kids doing the same thing at the same time in the same hallway - kids that frequently got in trouble. The dick hall monitor noticed me, a straight-A student, didn't belong there, breaking the rules, and gave me detention. I said something like, "I do all my work and have never gotten in trouble for anything." He said, "I know but YOU know better." Fuck that. 




 no. 




 About a month ago I was getting ready for bed at my girlfriend's apartment when I heard her two cats making those weird purring/hunting noises in the kitchen. I was like "Oh shit, there's a mouse." My girlfriend was in her room, so I wandered into the kitchen to subtly investigate. Sure enough they had a small rodent trapped in a corner of the kitchen under an end-table. I kind of just hung out for 5 minutes until they flushed it out. One of them grabbed it in his mouth and before I could react, he shot over to the g/f's room and dropped it on the floor just outside her open door. The SECOND she looked up and saw the cat she knew what had happened (neither of us knowing if the tiny rodent was alive or dead) and screamed, "Ugghhaaahh what does he have?? What does he have??? Get it!!! Please!!" I was laughing so hard at her reaction that I kind of paused then realized, oh crap it might be alive and run into her room. But it wasn't, sadly. I stepped on the poor little mouse to make her feel better but be assured, the kitty had already killed it. 




 Good. Fuck them. 




 so cool 




 Health Care. 









 That translates to roughly 2 hours a day, every day, for almost 14 years. If that's the case then I'm an expert in staring at cleavage. Nailed it.
