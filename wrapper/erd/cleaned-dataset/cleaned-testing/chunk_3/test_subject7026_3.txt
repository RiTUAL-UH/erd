 Pomson isn't that bad though, 10% uber is 5 seconds and less than half of an Ubersaw swing. It's more annoying than overpowered. And before Medic mains get mad at me, I too, am a Medic main.

 Play Medic so you can heal people, if you wont do it then who will?  
I guess I will since I sold all of my Soldier crap for Medic crap. 




 [Damn right it is.] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440_2_3741638880) 




 Assuming you do 100 or more damage with both hits, you can.

My nanny uses the Gunslinger. 




 Have you two ever traded items? Because if you ever gave him a free item he becomes a kind of free to play to play. It happened to me and a friend of mine, we were doing trading way before we got Premium and when we got the Mann Co Cap from buying something neither of us got the Speks option. 




 I second this.

 Someone told me to post it to truetf2 so I did it. 




 test_subject7026's Dead Ringer/Cloak and Dagger/Invisiwatch is now rank whatever.  
  
This has gotten me killed a few times and has helped me get kills a few times. Unless you have a Hale's Own, it's not a good idea to use a strange watch. 




 Can I have that script? I've started playing Medic and I feel like it would help greatly. 




 If you hit a dude like three times then he Dead Ringers it's believable  




 test_subject7026's Strange Dead Ringer has ranked up!  
  
Screw you, Valve, now everybody knows I'm a Dead Ringing bastard.  
  
If you have a Strange Dead Ringer, I'd highly recommend that you do some strange leveling for that baby. I sold mine because of it getting me killed two times.  
  
EDIT: Ok so I made a mistake in saying comp because apparently everyone knows if there's a Dead Ringer in pubs, but my point still stands for the other watches. 




 Spy is a soft counter to everything in this game, his sappers only break your guns if you're not near them or if you're dead. If you're dead then Soldiers and Demos can take it out anyway, and they can kill you easier than a Spy.  
  
I'm speaking from past experience by the way. I've hardly ever had trouble from spies. 




 I do it when I play CS:GO sometimes :] 




 I'll do my part and tell you all of my binds from f1 - f9  
  
scout is noob class he runs too fast  
soldier is noob class just shoot feet get kills  
pyro is noob class just wm1 get kills  
  
demo is noob class m1m2m1m2  
heavy is noob class click and hold for bullets  
engineer is noob class just hit sentry get kills  
  
medic is noob class don't even kill anyone  
sniper is noob class just click on heads get kills  
spy is noob class no explanation necessary  




 Can you pop with the Overdose out? Taking out the xbow is only for when you need a burst of hp you can't do with the Medigun or are at a distance. 




 Spy is removed, Spy Mains are pissed, everyone else is happy. 




 That was the intention. There's a reason I have this account. 




 So I was chilling out in Foundry having a good time when out of nowhere a bullet goes through my head and I'm like "Damn that was a good shot." And then I see who did it and go "That's probably a hacker." I came to this conclusion when I saw the Gibus. I also noticed that he was about 3,000,000 lightyears away from me when it happened, so I spectate him and I see some Sniper gameplay, now I'm gonna admit now that I like hackers. Kinda. I like seeing what they do and how proud they are of it, it's just funny to see the stuff they do sometimes, but being the good guy I am I told the server and the guy says "Nah it was just luck." to which I replied "I know what cheats look like, I know what it looks like to shoot far away from a dude and get a headshot." and he goes on his merry way chanting "Whatever bro".  
  
So we're on Coldfront now, my hands are freezing, my coffee is countering that. And then from across the map like some Robin Hood bullpoop an arrow goes directly into my soul, reaping me of all the enjoyment I had. Now others are starting to talk about it. Things are getting so heated that the snow is melting, I decide to take a few seconds to message a good friend of mine named [Max] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh1Vo6mLv0g) asking him how he feels about [hackers who deny it when it's obvious] (http://i.imgur.com/eBvudfa.png)  
  
The guy starts to get nervous at this point, almost as if I've spoken to his parents about his poor grades at school. He starts a votekick on me which fails with a final score of 2:14, he tells me that "People hack every day, get over it" and he promptly gets kicked in the nuts by everyone on the server.  
  
So anyway, what are your opinions on the Baby Face's Blaster? Do you think it's OP or just a Side Grade? 




 I like your name. That's all. I like your name. 




 how to upclock as sonic from boston 




 how to do deadclock as french stick  
how not die but look die as international businessman  
how make pretendsies death as crab man  
where to get rich man watch for baguette  
how go ghost as danny phantom cosplayer  
who give infinite health code to sneaky man 




 That is the reason I lose 20% of my 5cp matches, I want to change to Spy and sap the nest, I want to sap the 6 Engineers, but we already have 3 Spies. It's so much easier to play the game when the Spies have a functioning mouse. 




 As a vegan, these kinds of people make me want to drink a coffee and eat a steak with a side of eggs. Also I'd have a can of pepsi because that is a great drink. 




 I am known to lie from time to time, but when it comes to hats I'm an honest man :] 




 Exactly, which makes me think he got it from somebody else for some reason. I just have a strange feeling he did. They go for like 4 extra keys if they have any spec kit on backpack.tf but basic ones don't add any value really so buying one with it just seems likely. 




 Knowing is half the battle  
  
^^^^^^^^^^GI ^^^^^^^^^^JOE 




 Granary Mid. I love Granary as a whole, but in MGE if you want to fight me you aren't going to if you want to fight in Granary Mid, I just don't like it. 




 It's got basic killstreak which makes me think otherwise, I don't know why, it just does. 




 [Pringle has a bad taste in anime] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440_2_3725312782) 




 Dude I'm the leader of the Lucky Shot Hot Shots, the reason is that I have an unusual Lucky Shot with, wait for it, Stormy Storm! 




 And my bow 




 The worst part is that I forgot why I reset and I played some Mannpower and long story shot I have 500 points as Spy. 




 Ruined my high score loading menu stats thing. I reset it because I was pretty mad. I had 400 points as Soldier, I know I'm good and all but I'm not *that* good. 




 /s. 




 Strange Levels are a direct rip off from Dota 2, proof being that they count things.  
  
That's what my "Inscribed Amulet Gloves of Whatever" do right? Count things and rank up? idk I never played Dota. 




 How would those even work though? 




 I also kinda thought it was ping because I don't know about that nerd stuff :] 




 Lenny faces make someone a 4channer? I better inform all those pink Snipers! 




 They probably care about this one because Wayne is #6 on backpack.tf and d0 is #50, two rich backpacks will be looked at over the thousand poor ones, I'm afraid. 




 I'm sure there will be a lobby kind of system like MvM, so playing as a team seems more than likely. :] 




 If you're on a gambling website and get salty over losing something you've got issues. 




 I'm not even good  
  
I agree. 









 It sucks though because they find the delete button and then nobody else can know of such joys!  




 Unlikeable? He switches from a Godly Person to literally Hitler on a dime! 




 That crew has so much money made so often that doing this and basically ruining all their credibility would be horrible for them. 




 You can survive three without an overheal. I do it all the time. 




 This was way too long for me to read, and I'll probably read it later, but the one thing I want to say is that you can live three stickies from jumping. :] 




 Probably something along the lines of "Somebody really wasted $3000 on a livestreamer? What a fucking loser."  
  
 




 I like the speed boost every now and again. It's also what I use in the actual game, I use MGE for practising and improving, I'm not going to use something I don't use in the normal game in MGE. 




 My Gaming Edge, 1v1 with instant spawns on different arenas, score limit of 20.  
  
Mostly for 1v1s but you can do a 2v2 basketball thing 




 They are way way better, which is why I don't understand the dude calling it broken, I might add that I was on Granary Mid, a small map where you can't hide and regen. 




 Sorry I phrased the thing a bit wrong, I meant you can do more depending on the situation, the situation being that the rockets are aimed around the feet and the shotgun is aimed around the chest, I've seen ~100 damage a couple times, and the rocket launcher is a very splash based weapon most of the time, the splash damage does around 80.  
  
  
The 2 hp per second saved me like twice during the fight, and half of his kills were with the Shotgun anyway. 




 Imagine someone yelling at a Pyro "THIS MEAT IS SO RARE BOBSPLOSION WOULD BUY IT!" 




 I personally love the thing (sorry /r/bisonmasterrace) but every now and again on MGE I'll get told that it "ruins MGE" and that the regen is super broken.  
  
I can see how on it's own it gives an advantage, but when they're using a Shotgun I don't see an advantage for me, they have a gun that can do more than the Rocket Launcher and think that the 2 hp per second is broken.  
  
What are your opinions on the Magic Conch? 




 I would but the guy who gave me them wants to only make profit 




 Basically, I told my friend that I'd sell his whole inventory for pure and get him exactly what he wants, he game me *150* crates. One hundred and fifty. I can't find any website that will buy them in bulk, do you guys know any sites or people that will?  
  
[This is my inventory right now. Crate city] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440) 




 Fool I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to the person being all high and mighty, I also looked at their post history, [The first post they have on /r/TheButton was 10 days ago] (http://i.imgur.com/4YsbR29.png) which shows that they most likely did not arrive on day one. 




 /u/trollabot MommyNurse2012 









 I hide mine because I am an enigma, wrapped in a mystery, I will tell anyone who asks that I did infact press the button, anybody who wants to know can know that I pressed at 60, and that doesn't make me dirty, that makes me early, I've likely been here longer than you have you dirty grey. 




 I'm jealous of all of them, mostly the Engineer. 




 You're like the kid who sits in the back of the class just to say something to prove the teacher wrong. 




 I see what you're getting at, but potentially there could always be another Burning Team Captain waiting inside that crate #4 you have sitting around, or a Sunbeams Killer Exclusive. Although it is much more likely that you would get the kritz/awp, you will 99% of the time get utter garbage. 




 I don't think a Strangifier for some weapons would be a great idea, I'm mostly saying this because a Strange Vintage would make the Stranges from earlier be less valued 




 They're too big for Mom's fridge :[ 




 Thank you for the SFM, and is that a Glengarry Bonnet I see? That was actually the second unusual I got before I cashed out and restarted. 




 [I suddenly support the idea] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GTzHd1h47o) 




 Boys, we have a traitor! 




 Too many greys are going to go for red, hey assholes! Don't press the button! Day one pressers are excusable because we didn't know what was going on, you guys know what it does. 




 Give the button the sweet release of death! 




 cunt 




 I didn't draw them but the dude who did told me the moment he gave them to me that the Heavy and Demo look like trash, he's definitely improved since he did these, I can probably get a picture of his Sniper which is actually much better. Also, who is Medli and can I kill it? 




 Do you guys want me to do this for the other 8 classes?  
  
Well probably 7, I'm not gonna list "Hudda hudda huh!"  




 Thanks for the idea. 




 I always have this fear that I will walk into it and take damage. 




 Can you remember what this particular post was? Was it a link to his soundcloud? 




 Speaking of things that include movement speed, do you ever see a BFB Scout going slow and assume it's a Spy? Because I do this way too much. 




 Ooh, dude you might want to give up on that before you get too far into it, as much as I love the idea of it, I don't think Valve would want a taunt added to the game that removes the Pyro's mask.  




 Are you the same Smithsonian that dominated like 5 people on a Sawmill game using Loch n Load? The dude who may have been you had an unusual Sober Stuntman, just wondering. 




 Be a counter to cunt a cunt 




 It sounds like the MvM spy laugh tbh 




 I don't 




 Yes! 




 I main Soldier because I have 0 skill, I just go on any KOTH map and win. It's not hard.  




 Then don't use those weapons? 




 I'd have to say the most fun weapon for me is the Liberty Launcher, combined with the gunboats you take a whopping 85% less rocket jump damage, You can take ~15 damage from 1 jump! It's so much fun to be able to use a damaging Rocket Jumper and a Direct Hit without the splash reduction!  
  
Least fun to use? I'm sorry to the people who like them, but any Sniper or Spy item annoys me and I can't find fun in them, it's such a boring way to play in my opinion, *opinion* being an important word here, I see the value of them on the team and know that they have so much power with 1 shot potential, but I hate playing as/with/against them in every way. I'm sorry I just hate them. 




 The Strange Kritz is as rare as an unusual in the latest crates, same with the AWP, they care enough to not fuck people over and also let people obtain a Kritz without opening one of the most expensive, if not *the* most expensive crates.

 I never tried Final Fantasy VIII (That is 13, right?) but I don't think I'd like it. You don't need to play a game to know it's not your cup of tea y'know?  




 The more people that press it, the less there are to press it when it becomes like red or something, how many among your tribe are longing for red? Probably like 2. 




 I love to Market Garden, but it's kinda hard when eagles are being hunted, you catch my drift? 




 Oh man I love Battletoads!

 I became a p2p at around 500 hours, I already had like 18 hats at that point from crafting drops and some trading.  
  
I didn't really need any hats from the store, just keys baby!  
  

Also you can become some weird mix of f2p and p2p by getting traded a weapon, so that's how I became f2p2p at 150 hours or whatever.
