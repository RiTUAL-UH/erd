  they are hoping for 5-6 seconds a lap which is a massive difference on what they do now 




 yet another thing they will have to address as well as these changes

people just illegally stream even though the quality is terrible 




 they may of been leaving for years but it got worse after 2014 the noise is only one part of it

every article i've read on these changes is full of people happy refueling is coming back and that there will be louder cars

people want faster louder cars

 




 you may be happy with it but a lot of people are not, it's more important to draw the fans back that are put off by the current state of f1 and possibly draw new fans in 




 so many people don't want these changes but guess what the biggest complaints about f1 are slow cars, less noise etc etc

a lot of fans has been driven away from the sport these changes will hopefully bring them back and attract new ones

you can't keep it the way it is especially when track attendance and tv audiences are dropping it's the whole reason they had this meeting in the first place 




 the entire reason they are bringing this back is a LOT of fans miss the spectacle that f1 used to be

you may think it's for 8 year olds but clearly a lot of people have been driven away from the sport due to the slower cars and less noise or they wouldn't be having this meeting to change the sport

getting those fans back and attracting news one will keep the sport alive not keeping it the way it is and have track attendance and tv audiences die off anymore then it currently is 




 if  the racing was good they wouldn't of had this meeting to introduce these changes

people are moving away from the sport in droves 




 a lot of people are no longer interested in F1 these changes could be a good thing and attract more fans to the sport

leave it the way it is and it will die off 




 they had to take a pay cut a few years back they used to get around 440k an episode 




 they will probably recast them because that's too many characters to retire you lose a lot of development like lenny+carl smithers+burns bart+skinner

however people are used to what they sound like since they have heard them for over 20 years so suddenly changing voice actors will sound weird 




 considering what they pay them it's not that bad of a request that they be there when they need them they get over $250,000 an episode 




 they will probably recast them because that's too many characters to retire you lose a lot of development like lenny+carl smithers+burns bart+skinner

 i think Ricciardo is given more credit then he deserves due to last year.. his wins came when Mercedes had problems and safety cars

i want to see him in a good car for a few years to see if he can consistently pull off results like that or if it was just a one off due to special circumstances 




 i don't like it when you know which team has won the championship 5 races into the season 




 no one is passing at the front because the teams are so far apart that the only action is in the midfield

f1 won't survive for years and years if this continues 




 you can since no one has seen gameplay yet and the game is far from being released

even with all the missing features it could still turn out to be a good game 




 it looks good but i'm just not sure of the timeline

it's weird seeing a Industrial Revolution Assassins creed game with trains etc but i guess after all the others from earlier timelines they had to finally do more modern

 




 f1 isn't going to survive if the only good action is teams fighting for scraps

people want to see a real challenge for the championship not know that one team has already won 5 races into a season because they are so dominant 




 they have to do something or F1 will die a slow painful death 




 Mercedes Ferrari and Williams drive in a procession whilst the other teams fight for scraps... that's if red bull torro rosso and mclaren can even finish the race

many other recent years have had better racing then this 




 f1 has been a procession for years instead of red bull leading it now it's Mercedes

Hamilton Rosberg Vettel Kimi Bottas Massa this has been basically every race so far and likely for the whole season just switch the names around when someone different happens
 




 i know, they need to change it though so they can at least push for a few more laps then they currently can

that way you can still have strategy with tyres but at least get some more racing 




 the races are getting more boring now with tyre management and DRS

no one pushes anymore because they need to save tyres it takes a lot of the fun out of the sport 




 they should make the tyres last a little longer then they do not the whole race long but enough so they can push for a few more laps then they can now

 




 he's just as good as Ricciardo 




 let them leave getting sick of the crying from them... they dominated for 4 years and now want to quit because they haven't got the best car

many other great teams have had bad years before but didn't want to quit because of it

red bull is like a child that just got told it can't have the toy it wants 




 my opinion is Ferrari is more interested in Bottas than Ricciardo if kimi leaves 




 i think people are just over the domination by Mercedes. 

We just came out of 4 years of red bull to go straight into 2 years of complete Mercedes domination (who knows if the same will happen next year)

at least a few years back after the 2000-2004 Ferrari domination the 2005-2006 seasons was actually close (kimi and schumacher almost winning) then 2007-2009 being different teams winning 




 seems they are willing to take the risk for some more speed at this rate they will keep getting 6th place or lower 




 urging Renault to take risks is going to lead to more engine problems but it's not like that matters considering both drivers have almost used up the allocated engines 









 honestly i hate this track with a passion and if it didn't have the history behind the track it would of been scrapped years ago 

qualifying is the only part worth watching for me 




 Monaco is worse 




 i thinking Ferrari might be looking at replacing kimi with bottas 




 the other teams have already improved the cars and some have more updates coming so i don't see it making a massive difference even when they do get the 2015 car..

 




 they are going to need a hell of a lot of funds to do any better the other teams will improve cars for 2016 and leave them in the dust again 




 they are just there to get in the way of other cars... they always get lapped 3-4 times and are at least 3-4 seconds behind in qualifying times

they have no place in F1 unless they improve significantly which i don't see happening  




 the pit stop is what screwed him more than anything but the start didn't help 




 it's time for marussia to leave F1.. 3-4 seconds behind in qualifying and lapped 3-4 times in a race 




 excuses.. no other team on the "dirty side" had a bad start he screwed up  




 Hamilton's shit start didn't help him as well as the bad pit stop 




 Hamilton screwed up at the start and had a shit pit stop vettel didn't ruin anything 




 don't even know why they are still even in F1 they are a joke 




 he won't lol if he blows the engine 




 these streams are like AIDS for me always cutting in and out at the worse times 




 ouch bad pit stop 




 he'll screw his tyres if he pushes too much 




 he had a shit start 




 button sounds drunk every time he makes a radio message 




 thanks seems like a good one 




 any decent streams going almost all of them are screwed 




 this will get downvoted to hell but Raikkonen is overrated and Ferrari is wasting money on him 




 it's basically been used for marketing so in a way it's disrespectful even if someone from the family approved 




 not the same as putting them on stage in front of a audience as a hologram especially when it's about marketing
