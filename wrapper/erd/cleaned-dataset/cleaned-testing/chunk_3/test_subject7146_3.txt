 lol I went internet only some time ago. Really, pretty much anything is out there. I finally bowed to the pressure of the non-techs in the house and got me some Dish Network. The woman can dvr whatever, it's her's.  




 Cool, it made the store, thanks for the tip.  




 More than you'd think. NetFront Life Screen, Rocket Launcher, SPB Shell, and Launcher 8 are the first that spring to mind.  




 When installed, did you go into your phone's settings  applications, find your app, clear defaults, data, etc? When unistalled, did you search for any associated folders and files saved on your phone ?  




 What, the list? Since the list has gotten so large and launchers have become more common I now watch the Play Store and check out all the new apps coming through, keep my eye on xda, periodically Google around, and listen to what people point out. It used to be updated every month or two, but I got tired of spending hours and hours at a time updating. Now I spend just a few minutes every day or two seeing what's new or what I've missed. I've also followed a suggestion to post the updates recently.  




 It has face recognition also, though I haven't played with it yet.  




 Now, I'm not sure if it has a limit to the number of previous episodes available or not. I just know I wanted to listen to How to Succeed in Evil (liking it a lot btw) and with 70+ chapters, the other podcast apps wouldn't let me start at the beginning. So I know Podkicker lets me go back at least that far.  




 So I can have access to more than 30 or however many previous episodes. I couldn't start at the beginning of a long podiobook. Podkicker doesn't give me that limitation.  




 I used them both, and prefered PocketCasts. But I could only download so many episodes. Since I also wanted to use my pod player for Podiobooks books (which can have tons of chapters) I use Podkicker now.  
Really, they are all very similar. 




 I posted this before, but it's gotten huge since then. It's now organized by minimum Android version needed to make it easier to navigate and find something you like.

The Big List of Home Launchers - March 22, 2013 (237 and counting...)
 




 Just looking around for other game clients that are worth looking into. I know of Games for Windows and Origin, but that's about it. Am I just not finding really good game clients or is Steam pretty much the only good one? 




 It is 100% wrong that I can buy a product that doesn't work, though is claimed to work, and the seller doesn't need to refund, fix, exchange, or make any kind of effort to resolve it other than shrugging their shoulders and saying "look around, maybe you kind find a way to fix this broken thing we sold you." It is wrong in any venue. 




 Yes. After each install. I've ran out of ideas. 




 I haven't even the words anymore. 




 TL;DR Steam won't help in any way.

My ticket so far...

Ok, my other ticket is going like this so far...

I read the fine print, I know it says you don't issue refunds. But you sold me an unplayable game. Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock has a glitch that won't allow me to pass a certain point in the game, a point none too deep I might add. I read the forums (I'm not the only one who has the glitch), attempted to contact the makers (never did respond), and have spent hours trying to get by it randomly (did once, but died immediately afterwards and got sent to the beginning of the level again, never could repeat getting past the glitch). All was for naught.

So in the end I was sold, by you, a game that cannot be played. Or at least, can only be played up to a point (London Underground II) and cannot be completed. May as well call it a demo that can only be played a few levels in.

As such, I can't see how it would be possible that I wouldn't be due a refund. I've uninstalled and re-installed the game (which didn't help), and have once again uninstalled it for good.

BTW, if you have a fix for the game, I would be eternally grateful and would accept that in lieu of a refund.

Hello Scur,

As with most software products, we will not offer refunds or exchanges for purchases made online as outlined in the software license - please review Section 3 of the Steam Subscriber Agreement for more information.

Please send me a copy of your conversation with this third party support team, which outlines what steps youve taken to try to get the game working on your computer and I will investigate this matter further.

I told them the same things I told you, essentially. Not much more to add. They still haven't contacted me, and I still paid you, Steam, for a game I can't play. In what world are you living in which that can't possibly be one of the few exceptions where you must provide a refund?


8 Message by you on Fri, 7th Dec 2012 11:40 am
I have 185 games so far on Steam. Are we really going to fall out of favor with each other over this?

...did you even read my original statement? I HAVE attempted to "troubleshoot my issue with the third party support team," but they will not respond after repeated attempts to contact them. I cannot force them to respond. Apparently you are privy to some secret method of making someone sit down and writing an email.

So I guess the dollars you've accepted from me in the past will have to suffice for the total amount you will ever receive from me. I will continue to use steam and play the games I've paid for, but you will NEVER see another cent from me again.

Thanks for nothing.


11 Message by you on Tue, 11th Dec 2012 10:05 am
Oh, wait. Scrolling up I see I told you twice that they won't respond. So apparently you're a dimwit who can't read, but can somehow copy/paste company-issued answers. Please have someone else respond. Preferably someone who knows how to spell "Victor,"


12 Message by you on Tue, 11th Dec 2012 10:10 am
And your supervisor would be preferable. I'd like him/her to see that you didn't even give my responses a cursory glance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So in my aggravation with Wiktor, I called him a dimwit. I'll apologize in my final response to him, then close the ticket since he isn't interested in even reading anything.

So can you tell me, where do I stand? Steam just sold me a game I can't play or get any kind of support or response from the third-party developer, and now keeping my $8.99 with a "Sorry we sold you a game that has a glitch that won't let you play it, or get help with fixing, but we're going to keep your money."

I really do have a crap-ton of games on Steam (granted, the bulk of my items aren't the high-dollar new games but games bought during sales), and have never had this kind of trouble with Steam before. I would gladly continue to purchase games from Steam if we could resolve this, but the developer won't help or even respond, and it seems that Steam isn't very interested in anything except pointing their finger to the deaf ears of the devs and saying "I know we took your money, but take your problems up with them."

Hello Scur,

Thank you for contacting Steam Support.

I'm sorry you are having an issue with this game. 

When did you contact the third party support team?

If they have not responded to your original ticket, I would suggest creating a new support ticket with them. It is possible the ticket has been lost in their system. 

They will be able to assist you in resolving the issue.

3 Message by you on Thu, 13th Dec 2012 4:49 pm

I emailed support 3 times. Can you please just refund my money? It's become obvious that no help is coming. As I said before, I really don't want to have a falling out with Steam over $8.99, but I can't just allow myself to be ripped off like that by a corporation, as in paying for a product that doesn't work and to be refused a refund, a fix, or a replacement. I'm stubborn like that.

4 Message by Support Tech Raymond on Sat, 15th Dec 2012 4:35 pm

Hello Scur,

We do not offer refunds or exchanges.

Our records indicate that you have played this game for nearly ten hours, effectively using the license.

At what point in the game does the glitch occur? 

Have you tried the community discussions/forums for help?

5 Message by you on Sun, 16th Dec 2012 2:41 pm

I played for 10 hours trying to get past the glitch. I didn't just hit a wall and demand a refund. I put in a LOT of time, as in hundreds of attempts, to get past the glitch. It is during the London Underground II level. When I boost River up the second wall, she's supposed to reach down and pull the Doctor up, as she would any other wall. Instead she just jumps down to follow me.

Yes, I've hit the forums. Others have found this glitch, and no one knows a way to get past it.

So I have an unplayable game. Thanks for the info that you will do nothing except keep my money. I can now officially say that you've seen my last dime, and any new games I buy in the future will be through some other means. I will continue to use the games I've already bought from you in the hopes that every time I play a multi-player it will cost you some small bit and you'll never ever receive any more compensation for it from me.

Again, thanks for being the giant conglomerate that cares more about 9 bucks than, up until now, a dedicated customer. Don't send me any more rationalizations for your greed, please, it just increases my ire.

6 Message by you on Mon, 17th Dec 2012 4:21 am

Here at a later time, I'm re-reading this conversation and realizing I didn't play anywhere near 10 hours. Maybe I left it on or something, but I played an hour or less when I hit the glitch, and I know I spent more time than that off and on trying to get past it. Not that it changes anything or that you folks care or anything. Just putting that out there.

They're your forums, I'm not doing any more leg work. I've washed my hands of Steam, keep the nine bucks for all I care.

Hello Scur,

Please feel free to reply or reopen this ticket when you have the necessary information.

10 Message by you on Wed, 19th Dec 2012 3:26 pm

Necessary for what? For you to continue telling me you won't help me in any way? What possible reason can I have to continuing this conversation? It's obvious Steam will do absolutely nothing about the faulty product that they sold to me, except pushing me to find my own answers about possible solutions to the glitch. Am I wrong?

11 Message by you on Wed, 19th Dec 2012 3:30 pm

I am so utterly disappointed in Steam, so instead of fruitlessly looking for solutions that don't exist or trying to get any sort of resolutions from Steam, I am going to spend my efforts in showing everybody that I can what kind of company Steam really is when the chips are down. I think Reddit is a good starting point. 









 Yup, GrooVe IP for me too. I'm always around WiFi, got tired of that Verizon bill since becoming a cord cutter.  




 I'm looking for alternative to the Google Voice app to text with my Voice account. I don't keep service on my phone, only over WiFi these days, and found that the Google Voice app isn't really the best. Sometimes texts won't show up in the inbox, only in the text box, so I'm not alerted. Any one know of maybe a mms, sms, or IM app that can work with Voice without service and only use WiFi? Or even some ideas? I haven't found anything yet. 




 lol I guess I stand corrected. That's a nice-looking home screen. 




 Different:

Claystone Launcher

Hi Launcher

NetFront Life Screen

Rocket Launcher

SPB Shell 3D

ssLauncher

TSF Shell
 




 I have 14 monks that are buying Smartphones off of me.

Another sentence I would have never believed that I would hear. 




 [Advanced Pro Widgets](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rdr.widgets.core feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5yZHIud2lkZ2V0cy5jb3JlIl0.) are great if you do a lot of socializing on your phone. 




 While I agree that Task Killers aren't the best way to go, my Androids have always had memory and lag issues until I fiddle with the minfree values. I don't have a newer phone anymore, and I hear that Android has gotten better about memory management, but the GB phones I have now all have issues until I use AMM or V-6 Supercharger on them. I like lots of tools and system apps though that like to take up memory. When I restore apps on a fresh GB ROM, my phones all lag until I make adjustments. Stock GB just doesn't handle them well. Without those adjustments, I can easily see why task killers are so popular. 




 I saw that featured in an Android article somewhere recently. Seems fine for women, but for guys? Meh... 




 I do that while I'm waiting for my inrupublic invite to come. I use GrooVe IP for phone calls over WiFi and Google Voice for texting. That way I can still use my Google Voice number for everything and on my new phone, too. 




 Also Android Community, Android and Me, Android Atlas, Android Guys, Talk Android, Androinica, AndroidPIT, IntoMobile, AndGeeks.

I use Pulse to view feeds lately, and those pop up in addition to the aforementioned. 




 Reversed tethering and a WiFi hotspot are the 2 apps you need. xda probably has them. Or you could just take a router with you. 




 I remember someone on some forum, xda maybe, who wanted to have something like that. Reversed tethering, I think he called it. So you just need reversed tethering and a hotspot app. I would search the forums for those 2 things. 




 [Here's a youtube comparing them against each other.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdU4jFmUGtA) 




 I used an app from the ap store, don't remember the name. But I just searched for "remove contacts" and poked through the results until I found something that looked good and would perform batch functions. 




 On my revue I'm mostly watching Amazon (I have Prime), Crackle, and Project Free TV. 




 Yeah, gratz on the first post, ignore the trolls with the low self-esteem. 




 Gratz! It's all uphill from here. :) 




 In today's world? As opposed to what, the dark ages?

Raising a child is a joyous responsibility I guess. My daughter is a part of me, so my life is just bigger. Sure it's life changing, but it's not life ending. If you're ready for a kid, have one. If not, then don't. You're over-thinking the whole thing, I think. 




 FWIW, as you'll discover in the Revue's browser, most of the major US broadcast and cable networks deliberately block access to their streams from Google TV devices. They don't like Google.

That's why I use the Clicker and Spotlight apps. They point you to streaming sites that allow GTV. And I have a HD antennae to watch local channels (albeit rarely). I was just hoping someone had some great free streaming sites or apps that I haven't yet. So far, Crackle is pretty much the only decent free site for streaming movies. 




 Bit on the dangerous side. :)

I've done a ton of geotech drilling all over south of 395 between South Capitol and 12th SE, so there are a lot of plans for knocking down older buildings and putting up new stuff that they haven't even started yet. 




 Did you ever notice that the lights on 7th sync at different times? I've made it all the way from Constitution to Silver Spring without stopping a few times after 4 pm. 




 It's kinda pathetic. Hardly anything there. Baltimore Aquarium is the one to visit. If you can survive the drivers, that is. 




 Link isn't working. For me, anyway. 




 I learned the hard way that one should *always* skip the National Aquarium in the Hoover building. 




 I recently ditched cable (live in small town, WAY overpriced) and went to just internet. So far I use Avia w/ Logitech Media Server to play anything on my computer, and it works fine. But as far as streaming, what are your options? So far I use Amazon Instant Video and Netflix, have a bookmark on my home to Crackle, and use Clicker and Spotlight apps from time to time to find other stuff. What sites/apps haven't I found yet? 




 I have a Revue, so I use a few apps to find stuff. Amazon Prime covers most of Netflix, so I dropped Netflix. Clicker and Spotlight are decent apps to find GoogleTV friendly channels. Cracked actually has quite a few decent movies, and it's free. Hulu won't play on Google TV, though, and I haven't found a free way to stream online content from my puter to my Revue yet. Avia will stream all my videos and whatnot from my hard drive, though. 




 I spent 7 yrs in NoVA and still didn't hit all the museums on the mall. 




 That I raised an awesome girl. 




 It was Detroit PD at first, but if there was any kind of evidence that suggested another state was involved, it would become federal. (best guess) 




 EAZY! 




 Perhaps a button at the top to open/close it? It would be nice to not have it taking up so much screen space. 




 Well, when I go to /r/Android in my normal Chrome, there's a big list of links in the right-side bar. How will it show that bar? 




 SwiftKey is my favorite, too. The predictions are awesome. And I went through the options to get it to behave as I liked.  




 The old market app downloaded and installed as many at once as they could.

The new play store app will put them in a queue. It will download one, then it will install it. While it's installing the first app, it will download the second app. If the app is finished downloading before the first is finished installing, it will wait for the install to finish. It won't download a third app until the second one begins installing. So it will only  do 2 things at any time: download a single app and install a single app. 




 I've become a fan of "Fast for Facebook" myself. 




 The reason why Google apps aren't included with CyanogenMods is because they aren't allowed to include Google apps with the custom mods. Copy-write laws and all that. So Google apps (gapps) must be installed separately. 




 Sigh.., it's neither of those. 




 Not a rock, but yes, [it's alive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyura_chilensis). Or was. 




 Yeah, I just tried it. 15 mins later everything was uninstalled. 




 WTF. I had mine still within warranty when it slid off the couch. Fell less than a foot and a half onto a carpeted floor, and broke the screen. They told me they wouldn't help me. 




 Nice looking widgets, but I keep those in a toggle bar in my dropdown. Much handier place to keep them, imo.

I do like that WiFi widget, though. Good idea. 




 So what's up with this, is it a nice setup? 




 My X2 has a HDMI port, so when I wasn't using it it sat next to the TV and streamed video (damn you, Hulu!) and my Ascend was given to my 8 yr. old daughter with GrooVe IP so she has her own phone as long as she's within WiFi. 




 That's how I feel about heights. When I was a kid I climbed trees and jumped from branch to branch like a monkey. Now if I try to, say, climb a ladder to the roof, by the time I get to the top I'm almost paralyzed. It's a horribly nerve-racking feeling. It doesn't matter how badly I want up there, it's just completely beyond my control. 




 I used it and really liked it, but there was some limitation (that I can't remember now) that kept me from using it like I wanted to. 




 Well, almost. I find it more enjoyable to manage my phone than actually use it. I love fiddling with it, and have been know to flash half a dozen times in a day.
