 They're just so peaceful. 




 This is what happens when people on the government dole are allowed to vote. 




 He tried to tax everything that moved in Maryland and it failed miserably.  We need someone who understands that businesses create prosperity and a welfare check doesn't. 









 Title is misleading. 

"Rohl, Dents attorney, contends that a close review of a video released this week shows Melendez pulling a bag of drugs from his pocket."

So his attorney contends this.  Where is the video? 




 Good for Indiana.

If I start a business, I should be able to decide who I do business with.  This whole politically correct mandate from the left is an obtrusive overreach.

We are free citizens not subjects. 









 The Democrat Party would have you believe that evil like this doesn't exist anymore.

They are naive and dangerous in any position involving national security. 



















 Iran will kill millions of innocent civilians when they obtain a nuclear weapon.  War will rage across the Middle East, Europe and possibly further.

But who cares?  We have a cool, mixed president and aren't racist and stuff. 














 When you funnel money through any government program, this happens.

After hundreds of billions of dollars of tax money, why are private schools still better than public? They operate on their own money so there is much more accountability and incentive to perform. 




 Except 50 cent wasn't shot with an AK-47. 




 Because nothing measures pure success in life quite like a great "Reddit track record". 




 Contrary to what they would have you believe, the Democrat party is really a party of elitism. 









 If you stacked the entire 2015 Department of Education budget in new one dollar bills it would reach from Los Angeles to New York....and back.

Do you think further increases of funding are going to

a) increase our students' performance or 

b) line the pockets of "administrators" and bureaucrats? 




 We already spend **HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS** of dollars on the Dept of Education.  It is a collosal failure and a demonstration of the inadequacies of central government bureaucracy.

We won two world wars without the DOE.

We put people on the moon without the DOE.

We invented the Internet without the DOE.

What have we done since the DOE?  We've sank to the lowest level education-wise of all first world countries. 

Abolish the DOE and give control of education back to the people.  We'll be just fine without it and billions of dollars richer. 




 Obama snuggling up with Iran.  Does he have to make it any more obvious?  He has never said one good word about America  and praises Islam every chance he gets.

The emperor is wearing no clothes. 









 Is your idea of a perfect government one in which everything is provided for you?

Because that doesn't make for a free society. 




 But...the Republicans!

The link I sent has **65** references. Did you even read it? 




 Liberals of reddit:  Why are you okay with Elizabeth Warren lying about her Native American ancestry?

http://elizabethwarrenwiki.org/elizabeth-warren-native-american-cherokee-controversy/ 




 If you think more funding makes a government program successful, please point your eyes to the Department of Education. 









 Humble pie. 









 Proof?  Have you been in a cave for the last 10 years? Do you really understand the state of Europe right now due to substantial populations of unassimilated extremists from the Muslim world? 




 Politically correct cowards of Reddit, put your heads back in the sand and keep telling yourself that the true evil in the world comes from white, Western capitalists.  









 These things are inseparable from massive, centralized government programs.
We will learn this the hard way. 




 Bureaucracy? Red tape? Queueing? Rationing? Inefficiency?
All while our masters in Washington don't live under the same rules?

Yes we can! 














 I should be able to decide who I do business with, if I'm a consumer **or** business owner.  




 Put an amateur in charge, get amateur results. 









 Get these clowns out of the White House. 









 Who cares how much it is?

Why would we put elites in charge of determining if you are allowed to keep your own money? 




 But putting the federal government in charge of the entire health care system makes perfect sense. /s 




 It was so horrible, he was allowed by the Taliban to carry a weapon. 




 You mean Republicans think when you die and leave your stuff to your children, it shouldn't be taxed?

What a horrible idea. /s 




 What is wrong with his wife working at Goldman Sachs?

Maybe we should put everyone in the finance industry in prison and have Obama's people run the entire industry?  /s

 Do you think Obama will ask the Taliban to give back the 5 BILLION he gave them? 




 It's ironic that someone with thousands of dollars of tattoos is flying across the world to threaten third world people that are driven to poaching simply to feed their families. 




 Why don't you go first? 




 Because a corporate tax rate of 40% will not create economic growth or jobs. 




 Why should I pay a higher percent of my income simply because I make more money?  

The progressive tax system is in obvious violation of the fourteenth amendment.  A different law is being applied to someone simply because they make more money.

Everyone should pay the same percent of their income. 




 TIL: Freedom is historically toxic. 




 Desperation is a stinky cologne. 




 Republicans take money from rich Americans --- outrage

Democrats take money from rich foreigners ---- crickets 




 Leave it up to Washington Post to attack a victim of attempted murder for political gain. 




 Guaranteed their parents are unassimiliated immigrants who don't give a shit about American sacrifices or traditions. 




 It is currently the longest period without a hurricane hitting the mainland US in recorded history. 




 The dispute is not that the earth is warming.

The dispute is whether humans are causing it. 




 Not when you consider they were *all* in custody at one point. 









 Obama did say he would "stand with the Muslims".

That's the only promise he's kept. 




 I'm looking forward to having someone back in the Whitehouse that values integrity. 




 "The U.S. has accepted two new immigrants for each additional job created since 2000"

Third world status?

Yes we can!

 









 I'm sure your plan doesn't cost $400.  Your employer is paying the rest. 




 My family's health plan now costs $2200 a month. 

How is this good for me?

 




 The same way Obama became President.

 Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. 









 1939 take two?

Yes we can! 









 Many conservatives are ex-liberals.  There are almost no liberals who are ex-conservatives.

Why?  Liberalism is largely based on ignorance of the realities of the world.  Once one learns these realities, they abandon the naive idealism of progressivism. 




 Eggcellent 




 And Obama golfs on. 









 Obama has vowed to find the evil, white Tea Party members responsible. 









 A campaign donation is far different than a payment to an elected official.

If our citizens think it's okay for the Secretary of State to run a charity that accepts donations from foreign governments then we are in trouble. 









 He was just murdering the women that Americans wouldn't murder themselves. 




 All prosperity in our nation comes from the private sector, through the 'evil' employers. Your god, the state, does not create any jobs, drive innovation or provide a sustainable path for people to leave poverty.

Government does not produce economic growth, private business does. 




 Vacations and pensions are benefits, not rights. 




 You're right.  John Kerry siding with America's enemies is not news.
 




 This, along with the proposed 75% income tax, will definitely attract more business!  /s 









 The Kurds did in fact greet us as liberators. 

 









 The federal government has no business defining and regulating "political activity"

Power corrupts. 




 Obama supporters: You wanted big government? You got it.
