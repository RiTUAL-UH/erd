Edit: nevermind.  




 We also like to verb nouns. 




 I just cannot do the Misfits. I can't explain why. 




 They were just touring with a bunch of heavier bands. If you're into metal/metalcore, that is. 




 My name is Mac. It's not so much annoying as much as I've just heard it all by now. 




 Tried. 




 Nope. 




 I've heard a lot of good things about it. I'll check it out! 














 So, "wore in my underwear while I made your order?" 




 Just your monthly reminder to go get a dog! 




 I feel like I've seen this video here multiple times in the past few weeks. I may be wrong, though. 




 Well, I can't explain them to you! I don't know what they are, either! 




 If you go to /r/bitcoin, there's lots of info there. 




 Don't need none'a that here! 




 I may have gone a little overboard... 









 I was seriously thinking it was the one I usually go to.... But your comment has made me second guess myself. 




 Every now and then I find myself wondering what it would be like if we just ejaculated one big sperm. It keeps me up some nights. 




 My neighbor's sister rear-ended somebody.... On her way out of the dealership. 




 When she was really young, my sister cut her hair on only one side of her head and then tried to walk past my mom and go to a friends house. She tried to play it off as her "falling" when my mom stopped her. 




 Yeah, but, ya know.... Fuck that. 




 KoTOR has to be one of my favorite games of all time! I've had it for years and only just finished it for the first time a few months ago. 




 Thank you! 









 Sex. I really don't care. 




 You realize how dark those movies really were, later on... And it's so fucked up. 




 Which Flashpoint is it, exactly? 




 I almost never use the Masterball out of fear that I'll need it some other time... 




 Why does religion always have to be cited as an enemy of science? The group that doesn't believe in these things is in the minority. You're being just as closed-minded as they are. 




 I don't know about trading, but you can sell at the LS Customs. 




 Swamps of Dagoba is a fucking masterpiece. 




 Well, there's all this philosophy about whether people are inherently good or evil. It's all perception and not really an answerable question. 




 I fucking loved this video in drivers ed and can't forget it. 




 That game has been and will remain in my top 5 forever! 




 *Karmanaut* 




 You are Karmanaut 




 I've been using an old piece of paper as a mouse pad for around a year, now. It's worked surprisingly well, so far. 




 This is seriously one of the most difficult questions, ever, for me. 




 It's especially sad because none of them recognized him. 




 All I hear is CITROEEEENN! 




 I'm having great fun with it. I just haven't been able to join any sessions the past 5 days.... 




 Nah, just as fun, though. 




 Because he's fucking good at it! 




 Whoa, there. 




 The seller has been killing everyone that they have sent the camera to and taken a picture. 




 I realize that it's not common at all, but I am currently learning about the stock market in American high school.

 I'm a pretty big fan of the Prius plugs on Bones. 




 The closest one is probably the Ruiner and that's pretty loose. 




 Do you have to keep putting cars back into the garage (mainly the 4 car ones)? I've noticed that if I took one out and didn't put it back in or it got destroyed, it would no longer be saved in the garage. This happened 3 times (once in franklin's/aunt's house garage, once in Trevor's 4-car garage, and once in michael's 4-car garage) and I'm wondering if it's a glitch or the game is supposed to be like that. 




 You *know* Rockstar would put that in, too.

 It's a Ron White story. He's a comedian. I'd recommend him to anyone. 




 That's middle school in a lot of places. 




 Did this... Did this just get posted multiple times on one post? 




 I don't own a WiiU, but I have a PS3, so prepare for bias. PS3 is awesome. Get one. 




 I consistently fall behind technology-wise and end up moving to new eras a lot slower than all the other civs. I don't really know what to do about it... 




 Because they're actually a communist propaganda manufacturer.

Edit: as well as the letter Z and the number 20. Those are tools of communism.

 Hey! I have one of those, but it's shaped like a deer! 




 Well, he *is* really good at dying. 




 It looks like whoever took this screen cap is missing some models and textures. 




 I think what you're talking about is the guy that kept a journal of everything he did in Skyrim. It actually really helps with immersion if you like writing, at all.

 Have you heard their new EP? 




 Somebody make a subreddit just for these videos. Now.

 As a teenager, fuck them. 




 I finished that game for the first time since buying it years ago.... And it felt great. 




 Simultaneous isn't bad.  




 I definitely didn't play the third one to see the ending. I really wanted to see how my decisions in the second game affected the third game. 




 Oh, my god. Fuck those guys. 




 I got to have the rare experience that is a wall of death in a 150-200 person venue. It was... Odd, to say the least.
