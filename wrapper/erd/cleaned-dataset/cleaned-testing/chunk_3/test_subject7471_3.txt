 I run a fun, small subreddit: /r/SummerScavengerHunt. Every year on June 1st we share a scavenger hunt list. Participants post photos and videos of themselves finding items or completing tasks from the scavenger hunt list (last year's list can be found in the sidebar) and then the moderators award points to your team if the submission meets the criteria (teams can be one or two people). 

Here are some of the items people submitted for last year's scavenger hunt:

[#89 A drink with a phallic name that isn't Bawls](http://i.imgur.com/Lnmg5mh.jpg)

[#142 Someone in a banana suit](http://i.imgur.com/3x3JG8Z.jpg)

[#165 A banknote with a denomination larger than 1,000,000](http://i.imgur.com/K5fmlLE.jpg)

[#202 Make a pair of ice skates by attaching ice to the bottom of your shoes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaXsKrmg4io feature=youtu.be)

[#260 Feed an animal (besides a human) a carrot out of your mouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_qerX9uuK0 feature=youtu.be)

It would be great to have some more participants this year, so please join in the competition! 









 There would be about 18% less GHG emissions, substantially less water usage, lower rates of heart disease, far less risk of antibiotic resistant bacteria evolving and killing people, fewer [dead zones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_%28ecology%29), fewer dangerous algal blooms. 

There would be a lot of major global consequences if the world was filled entirely with people like you. 






























































































 That's awesome news! What got you to start looking into the issue just a few hours ago? What did you see/learn that changed your mind? 




  deontological

I'm more of a consequentialist actually 




 [If this guy can be vegan with his metabolism, I think yours can handle it too](http://veganworkout.org.pl/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/941424_4174963751044_813804607_n.jpg) 




 Is there any other ethical question where you say, "if you're able to commit the action yourself then that makes it okay?" That seems really out of line with how most people feel about other ethical issues. 




 A century ago when orangutan populations were relatively undisturbed there were roughly 230,000 in the wild. Today roughly 50,000 remain. [Source](http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/great_apes/orangutans/)

Even for the production of vegan foods it is likely that many millions of animals every year lose their lives. It is tragic that any animals die, but palm oil is not unusually harmful to animals compared to other foods we have available. 




 You don't get to just be ethical some of the time when it is convenient or when you feel like it. Being ethical means evaluating all of your choices and considering how your actions impact others. 

An ethical person also isn't someone who just considers how their actions impact certain groups that they deem worthy. In order to be ethical you need to consider the impact your actions have on all others. There is no reason why that should only include humans. 




 Oh, vegan diets are by no means an anti-keto diet. There are actually large communities at /r/vegetarianketo and /r/veganketo. I was just trying to show that the healthfulness of vegan diets is backed up by solid evidence. 




  Nobody cares about the most "ethical" diet either.

What? Everyone should care about making choices that are ethical. 




 And unlike keto diets, vegan diets have support from mainstream dietary organizations and experts:

  why would I go vegan?

You were "vegan" [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/31n10f/federal_report_vegan_diet_best_for_planet_a/cq5mmc4) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/2y0oj5/sharing_an_apple/cp5hoqg). Why don't you ask yourself? 




 India is doing very well in terms of health compared to countries with a similar GDP per capita. Obviously they aren't going to be as healthy as a much wealthier nation that can afford far better health services.  




 Just like all those rich vegetarians in India - all marching down to buy whatever expensive foods they want from their local Whole Foods /sarcasm

The world's poor rely upon cheap staples like rice, beans, and cassava that are all vegan. Meat is considered a luxury by most people on this planet. You need to be completely out of touch to think not eating meat is only for rich people. 




 I clicked on both of your links under the header "vegan children don't grow normally". One of them studied vegetarian children and said their height was within the normal range. The other was about macrobiotic diets.  




 Did you give up on pretending to be vegan? 




 That's unfortunate that your wife is struggling with anemia. Clearly her current meat heavy diet isn't sufficient to meet her needs. While taking iron supplements is probably a good start, there are many other factors that can increase or decrease iron absorption (for example consuming vitamin C with iron will increase absorption, while foods containing phytic acid will decrease absorption). There is no reason why she would have to rely upon meat as a superior source of iron. 

Finally, nobody is pushing anything upon you by simply writing something on the internet. Feminists aren't forcing their beliefs upon others when they say that women should receive equal pay for equal work or when they say all women should have the opportunity to receive a basic education. As Elie Wiesel famously wrote: 

We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere.

The people who are pushing their beliefs on others are those who are forcing animals to live lives in terrible conditions of confinement and who force these animals to ultimately be slaughtered for their meals.   




 There are large communities of people over at /r/vegetarianketo and /r/veganketo surviving on the sort of diet you are proposing without any meat. That said, following the sort of diet you propose is still vastly outside of mainstream dietary advice (despite being perfectly possible as a vegan). 

The American Dietetic Association addresses Omega-3s in their position paper. I'm much more inclined to trust the world's most prominent dietetic organization on the subject (who also cites peer reviewed research to back up their position) than I am inclined to take your word on it. 




 Every major dietary organization in the world has published statements saying appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. Anyone who rejects that is radically outside of the overwhelming scientific consensus.

**INGREDIENTS**

Mushrooms: 

* 2 portobello mushrooms, sliced
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 tbsp. olive oil
* 2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar
*  tsp. salt

Dough:

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 tsp. instant dry yeast
* 1 tsp. sugar
* 1 tsp. salt
*  cup warm water (105-115F)
* 2 tbsp. olive oil 

Guacamole:

* 3 large avocados, ripe (soft not squishy)
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
*  lime
* 1 small tomato, diced
*  red onion, diced
* Salt


**Instructions: ** 

Guacamole: 

1. Cut your avocados in half and remove pit. Spoon out avocado into a medium bowl. Add in garlic, salt, and freshly squeezed lime. Mash avocado until smooth. Add the tomatoes and onion, stirring until combined. Cover and refrigerator until chilled, probably a good hour. Give it a taste test to see if it needs more salt or lime.

Mushrooms:

1. Preheat oven to 425F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Toss the portobellos in a large mixing bowl with the olive oil, salt, balsamic vinegar, and garlic. Mix gently until combined and all mushrooms are coated. Place onto baking sheet and cook for 15 minutes. Remove and set aside.

Crust:

1. Add the water and oil to the bowl of your stand mixer. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Attach the dough hook to your stand mixer and start the mixer on low. Carefully add the flour mixture to the wet mixture, increasing the speed of the mixer as needed. Mix until the dough forms a ball and clears the sides of the mixer.
2. Lightly flour your counter. Place the dough on top and knead until smooth and elastic, between 5-7 minutes. Lightly grease the bowl of your stand mixer and set the dough inside, rotating the bowl so the dough becomes coated in oil. Cover and set aside for 1 hour (or until dough has doubled in size.)
3. When ready to use, preheat oven to 475F. Deflate the dough by punching it and pouring onto your floured countertops. Roll out into a large size pizza crust and place onto your pizza pan. Brush dough with olive oil and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown and desired consistency is reached.

Pizza assembly:

1. Spread the guacamole across your COOKED pizza dough. Once smooth, top with the portobello mushrooms. Cut and serve!

 That is because vitamin B12 is produced exclusively by bacteria. There are tons of foods fortified with vitamin B12 and a supplement costs pennies per day. This is not an insurmountable hurdle. 




 You mean amino acids, not proteins. The same amino acids are used by all known life forms though, so these are by no means easier to get from meat than from a plant-based diet.

  I put mushrooms, beans, tomatoes, avocado, corn and so on until /u/test_subject7471 comes over and eats all my food.

FTFY

 




 Nope. I spend 40 hours per week working for a company that administers health insurance and pension plans. I do volunteer with animal rights groups in my free time in addition to sharing things on reddit. 




 Also /u/tyroneking deserves a lot of credit for [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/36qv3n/laying_down_with_a_cow/crgfw1u). 




 I'm vegan for the animals, but my health, the environment, and personal superiority are nice added benefits! 




 Those first three are all gifs that I made and shared. That last one was someone else. 




 Check out /r/veganrecipes. It is a great place to find ideas for delicious meals that are egg-free! 




 Once again, how would it even hypothetically be possible to show that plants feel pain? What sort of experiment could be conducted? 




 You're welcome. :-D 




 How could a study even hypothetically show that?

I am familiar with the sensational news stories that get published every time a new piece of research comes out about plants reacting to stimuli. While the research is fascinating, rocks also react when kicked and light bulbs react when an electric current is passed through them. That doesn't mean that rocks and light bulbs can feel.  



















 Note: I did not write this. A friend of mine who works for the Humane League shared this.

I went vegan after receiving a leaflet on the horrors of the animal industry. This was handed to me four years ago, when I visited my cousin's college. I would like to pay this forward now by taking a more active role in animal advocacy at my university. I recently realized that to be the best vegan I can, I have to change not just myself, but influence others as well. With The Humane League's resources and support, I will enthusiastically work to increase people's knowledge on the environmental and ethical problems of animal farming, and hopefully spur them to action--and to veganism! 


































 There are a few people saying it is vegetarian-shaming, but people also said that last time I posted a picture that essentially said, "be nice to animals". 




 There are plenty of people who give up on their vegetarianism, and hopefully seeing a reminder of why being vegetarian is so important will encourage people to maintain their vegetarianism. Furthermore, simply being vegetarian isn't everything that we can be doing to help these animals. We can donate to animal rights groups, get involved in animal rights activism, cut dairy and eggs out of our diets, and much more. Hopefully people here who already care about these issues will do more to help after seeing just how tragic videos like this are, not just for this one cow, but for millions of other similar cows. 




 I don't see anyone attacking anyone. The only critical comments in this thread are in response to the person who said they wish they were as lucky as that cow. 



























































 I enjoyed it, I'm glad he did it, but there was way too much, "you could stop eating chicken, but you're not going to do that." 

A piece like that needs to have the guts to say, "we *should* stop eating chicken." Without that it will only have a tiny fraction of the impact that it otherwise could. 




 I'm not the person who wrote the message, so I couldn't tell you. 




 I have been vegan for the past 7 years. Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis. 




 Most vegans don't care what you eat. They care about who you eat and who is harmed in the process of producing it. I think we can all agree that it is important to consider how our choices may harm other individuals. 




 I do not. A Facebook friend of mine who works there shared this. 





























 I am interested in interning with The Humane League because I was recently exposed to issues of farm animal cruelty when someone was handing out leaflets on my college campus. The leaflets included information about the abuse farm animals suffer and a quote about how it's odd that we cuddle some animals (our pets) but stick forks in others (farm animals). I have always been an animal lover and have been trying to become vegetarian for years, but this really hit home with me and I have become vegetarian. I think that spreading awareness about animal cruelty is the most efficient way to get people to understand it, as many people are unaware of the cruelty that occurs. I would love to be part of an organization that works to fight against this. 





























 Did you give that mouse a cookie? 




 Now I want to try hitting a PB J sandwich with a baseball bat and film it with my high speed camera.  




 Humans are not sentient. You're just anthropomorphizing. 




 You know me well.

I eat a lot of the foods featured in this fridge, but it is not mine. 



























































 The threads that were deleted because people's personal information was revealed, which also led to accounts being banned?

Are you trying to set me up? 




 There is overwhelming consensus that humans can be healthy on vegan diets. Once again, who cares if it is "natural" or not?

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. 




 We also don't commonly live to 80 years old in nature. We all benefit greatly from fortified foods like iodized salt, enriched flour, and fortified cereals. It is also recommended that [all pregnant women take a folic acid supplement](http://www.webmd.com/baby/folic-acid-and-pregnancy). We can, and already are doing things much better than nature thanks to supplements and fortified foods, and many other unnatural aspects of modern life.

On the other hand, humans have engaged in tribal violence for all of recorded history and we even see signs of it among other great apes, so war and violence seem very natural, but I think we would both agree that they are not good.

Simply stating whether or not something is natural tells us nothing about whether we ought to continue doing it going forward. 




 I'm not denying that vegans should either take a vitamin B12 supplement or eat fortified foods to ensure that they are getting an adequate supply. 




  Good luck getting your B12 without supplements.

B12 is a vitamin, not a protein. It is produced by bacteria. 




 /u/Zhaey deserves the credit. He compiled the list. 




 But will we ever be able to answer one of life's greatest questions?

 Yep! There is wide consensus on this point!

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

 Anything heated up over about 1000 Celsius will start glowing. 




 It could also mean you eat things that emit light. 














 [I shared this two days ago](http://np.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/361zz5/chicken_runs_to_her_boy_for_a_hug_but_somethings/) :P 














 Someone else compiled the list. I think they wrote a program that did it. 




 I run a fun, small subreddit: /r/SummerScavengerHunt. Every year on June 1st we share a scavenger hunt list. Participants post photos and videos of themselves finding items or completing tasks from the scavenger hunt list and then the moderators award points to your team if the submission meets the criteria (teams can be one or two people). 

Here are some of the items people submitted for last year's scavenger hunt:

[#89 A drink with a phallic name that isn't Bawls](http://i.imgur.com/Lnmg5mh.jpg)

[#142 Someone in a banana suit](http://i.imgur.com/3x3JG8Z.jpg)

[#165 A banknote with a denomination larger than 1,000,000](http://i.imgur.com/K5fmlLE.jpg)

[#202 Make a pair of ice skates by attaching ice to the bottom of your shoes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaXsKrmg4io feature=youtu.be)

[#260 Feed an animal (besides a human) a carrot out of your mouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_qerX9uuK0 feature=youtu.be)

It would be great to have some more participants this year, so please subscribe and join in the competition! 




 In circumstances where no harm is caused to animals to produce an animal product then I have no ethical issue with using it. You will find this is frequently repeated position amongst vegans. For example, [here is an article about how it is ethical for vegans to eat oysters](http://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) (you can find several more articles along these lines with a Google search), and [here you can find an essay from Ingrid Newkirk about how she is excited to eat lab grown meat](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/20/magazine/ethics-eating-meat.html?_r=0).

I think with a little research you will quickly see that cruelty is still inherent in any commercial production of wool and eggs. I would say we don't understand the experiences of bees very well, but it is quite plausible given our current understanding that they suffer greatly as well. 

Finally, meat isn't going to be abolished tomorrow. Hopefully, demand for meat will decline down the road and fewer animals will be bred into existence to meet the lower demand. There are still wild or feral chickens, boars, and cattle living in several parts of the world, so their existence will continue. If down the road there comes a time when a majority of our society wishes to abolish meat then we can decide whether to outlaw the breeding of new farmed animals and allow the others to still be slaughtered or if we desire to invest in providing safe living conditions for the farm animals who are alive at that time to safely live out their lives. Stopping the mistreatment of animals for human consumption is not an insurmountable hurdle. 




 This really just goes to show your lack of understanding of why people choose to be vegan. While buying organic is completely unrelated to being vegan we are well aware that manure is often used as a fertilizer. 

Being vegan isn't about some dogmatic avoidance of any product with some arbitrary connection that can be drawn to some animal product. The Vegan Society (which coined the term "vegan") defines veganism as:

Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.

Veganism is about minimizing the harm we cause to others, which is a cause that most sensible people would get behind.

 What version do you have? I am only familiar with version 1.4, but relative to the United States' dietary guidelines it is higher in fat and lower in carbohydrates. 




 Smile. Answer their questions politely (even if they are dumb).

You'll have to tell us what kind of outreach you are doing for more specific tips. 




 It is a food designed with the intention that people can eat it for every meal and meet all of their nutritional needs. My comment above is also a link to their website which explains it in much more detail. 




 I've had it. It definitely isn't gourmet, but I don't mind the flavor at all. It tastes a bit like pancake batter. 




 Is it vegan to eat a klein bottle? 




 I have watched Earthlings. It did get a lot of people to go vegan. It was not necessary to watch it to make that point.

 I'm sure you'll need this comment.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. 




 So you would like if people could just go into a random sample of farms and document how animals are treated there? We would love that too! Help us get rid of ag-gag laws and pass regulations requiring that farms be made open to these types of investigations.  




 I run a fun subreddit: /r/SummerScavengerHunt. Every year on June 1st we share a scavenger hunt list. Participants post photos and videos of themselves finding items or completing tasks from the scavenger hunt list and then the moderators award points to your team if the submission meets the criteria (teams can be one or two people). 

Here are some of the items people submitted for last year's scavenger hunt:

[#89 A drink with a phallic name that isn't Bawls](http://i.imgur.com/Lnmg5mh.jpg)

[#142 Someone in a banana suit](http://i.imgur.com/3x3JG8Z.jpg)

[#165 A banknote with a denomination larger than 1,000,000](http://i.imgur.com/K5fmlLE.jpg)

[#202 Make a pair of ice skates by attaching ice to the bottom of your shoes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaXsKrmg4io feature=youtu.be)

[#260 Feed an animal (besides a human) a carrot out of your mouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_qerX9uuK0 feature=youtu.be) 




 Why are there different rules protecting the troops from predatory lending practices? Shouldn't all Americans have the same protection against predatory lending? 




 What is a medium page?

 There are many mentally disabled children who can't grow up to be lawyers either, but that doesn't mean they should be treated the way we presently treat other animals. 




 I have considered myself part of the Effective Altruism movement since I read Peter Singer's book "The Life You Can Save" back in 2009.  




 I added him as a friend on Facebook a few months ago after seeing some of his really cringy earlier videos. He intends for his videos to be humorous, and while I agree many of them go too far into the awkward and cringy humor realm that invokes criticism, I thought this particular video was worth sharing. 

He is also doing a lot of other great animal rights activism work, such as having now passed out over 100,000 Vegan Outreach booklets on college campuses!

 I'm having the same problem. I'm doing a coffee cleanse where I drink 20 cups of coffee a day to cleanse my body of toxins, and I haven't been able to sleep at all! It must be because vegan diets are deficient in protein and essential nutrients. 




 I have read it. Good book, I encourage others to check it out. 




 I want to see more research about what works best for getting people to go vegan and/or reduce their consumption of animal products like [Humane League Labs](https://humaneleaguelabs.wordpress.com) is doing. They need more people donating to fund additional research. 




 Who do you think can afford to spend $4.00/lb for chicken, but can't spend $1 per pound for beans and rice? 




 Doesn't cultivating any land for any crop lead to loss of habitat? 




 I am not arguing that people don't enjoy the taste or convenience of animal products, but the point was made that they are "needed", which is false. 

People are a lot less sympathetic to those who say, "I kill animals because I enjoy it." 




 You can also get nutrition by eating human flesh. That doesn't mean you need to eat human flesh to get nutrition. There is strong scientific consensus that you also do not need any meat to have a healthy diet.
