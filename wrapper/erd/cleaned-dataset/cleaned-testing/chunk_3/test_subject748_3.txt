 Pantaria has a lot of weird creatures, but the most popular are Dungeon Dogs. They resemble Yorkies, but can assume the form of any inanimate object. They tend to favor the forms of treasure chests,giant keys and statues, ensnaring and devouring adventurers who find try and take them. 
Like Discworld's Luggage, the species has a stomach that apparently has no end, allowing the creature to swallow creatures and objects of any size. Magizoologists have confirmed that it's 'Really cool' and after sending an intern in, they confirmed that 'it's probably dangerous.'  

However, they can be tamed and several generations have been bred to be adorable house pets in various colors like orange, blue, red and pink. They tend to bond with one person in particular and will fiercely defend them to the death. They also do well with children as their morphable bodies allow Dungeon Dogs to withstand rigorous play. 

The species also enjoys adventuring with their masters, accompanying them into dungeons or even other dimensions. When at home, they tend to take the form of common house hold objects or sometimes other species of animals, albeit with the Dungeon Dog's true coloring.      




 YES! 




 I really wish someone would draw the Yogs in the style of Archer. 




 Livestock wandlers tend to be vegetarian and their forms are vastly different from domestic livestock. They're more like the animal's natural form. E.g: a pig wandler would be a boar, chicken, game cock ect. They also tend to be embarrassed about their forms and tend not to use their abilities.   Animal rights are pretty different because while meat is eaten, it isn't a major staple of people's diets. Whenever a person hunts, they can sort of tell who is a wandler and who isn't. Wandler's tend to be slightly bigger than the normal animal and hunters are taught how to make sure their shots are correct. 

As for wandler- made products, there probably is a black market for those, but most would see it as gross.  




 Not at all my friend! Thanks for asking, I shall respond in order of your questions.

1. Yes, the animals they become are in relation to where they were born. A polar bear wandler would've been trained to handle warmer climates, but they'd have a stronger affinity for and work better in colder temperatures. 

2/3. As for animal traits, the animal side is a tad like Firestorm in DC Comics. The animal side often nudges and 'tells' the human side what to do while in animal form, but in human form, this 'spirit' is gone. The level of control is dependent on the person's emotional state. If one is 'horny' or depressed while changed, the animal side can react in fear. Some walder's physiques mimic their animal forms while human, but usually the extent of animal abilities in human form is slightly enhanced sense of smell. But this varies. 

4. The shapeshifting doesn't last while their unconscious. Holding the form just takes practice so it varies from person to person. I'd imagine that the longest a walder could hold their form is an entire day if their focus was high enough or they needed to get somewhere fast.

5. Clothing must be left behind or be destroyed in the change. Items as well. Yes, it sucks if it's in the winter and you need your cheetah form to take down a fleeing enemy, but it's a part of the job. The training in the north is done primerly without winter gear, so they have some experiance in the matter. Modesty is usually perserved by having a cache of clothes hidden or turning a hair wrap into a loincloth (those stationed in tropical areas favor this over clothing any day). 

6. Wandler's can leave the order at any time without consequences. However, wandler's who are in service often look down on those who aren't, and life can suck in major cities where wandlers make up a good amount of the population. One character I plan for the first book will be dealing with his father's choice not to join. 

7. The naming conventions are similar to ours. Expect to see some 'Aidens', 'Nathans', 'Devins' and 'Reese's' mixed in with some more fantasy typical names. 

8. No, wandler's can't communicate with animals. If their smart and communicate with the 'animal' inside, they can get a understanding of what the animal is telling them, but outright communication would make them too powerful.    

P.S. This is how I can most acculratly show off how the whole 'animal voice in one's head would work. Sorry if anyone isn't into superheroes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJsMzTG1YCA
   




 Hey Redditors, I had an idea for a world for a possible series I want to write in the future. Here it goes. 

Set in a world similar to the medieval era called Faria, there are people who can become a single animal at will. Called Gestaltwandlers (Wandlers for short), these people are in charge of protecting normal humans and other races from supernatural beings similar to the Fair Folk called Volks. 

Wandlers are found at a young age and taken to one of the three academies and trained in either swordsmanship, archery or magic. They also are taken in by a teacher who becomes their mentor/parent. When they are around 15, they are sent to the Hall of Ice, a  dangerous training center in the frozen north. Once their training is complete, they get sent to one of the major cities and either patrol it or teach new Wandlers. 


When it comes to the world's geography, I need the most input. I know I want it to be similar to Earth's and due to the shapeshifting, I need it to as varied as possible. 

Magic exists, but isn't very reliable. If one is a mage in this universe, they tend to only use magic in rituals, similar to Willow's in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Magic usage opens the caster to the Volks influence and in some cases, can drive them mad. Magic can be used by anyone, regardless of race, species and gender. 

Any questions or possible plot ideas? Leave e'm in the comments below, I would really love the Reddit community could bring! Thanks!  




 Magic and technology can match each other. In my setting, magic was discovered around the first time that spears were made, so it's always been a sort of arms race to see who can outdo the other. However, sometimes machines like airships are a fusion of magic and technology. True robotics is a dangerous and new field and thus golems are a suitable substitute. Healing magic is good for when your on the field and need a quick patch up, but so is a bandage. The major reason why magic and tech are neck and neck is because for every magic spell that's researched, a new piece of tech or weaponry is whipped up in a lab somewhere.  




 Yeah, if it's fantasy, magic is the logical choice. I think sometimes people read into things too much.  




 Pantaria's races
Humans- As varied as normal humans are. Asian, African American, First Nations, you name it, the race is there. 
Elves- Come in two flavors the hipster Light Elves and the kind hearted dark elves
Orcs- Varied as humans. Although they seem brutish, they are actually really intelligent. Not all are warriors and some are mages. 
Fauns- Fauns are bascily humans with goat legs.  




 "Light Elves" in Pantaria are like hipsters. They hangout in expensive areas of towns and cities, selling their custom jewelry and drinking tea and coffee. Light Elves are stereotyped as 'dicks beyond mesure' for their patronizing attitude towards other races, but this sometimes isn't the case. Light elves usually wear their hair long and flowing, braided with silver wire. They wear the most expensive clothes and favor wine brands 'that you've never heard of' like Yentarian Yak or The Crying Dragon. Pioneers in anti gravity magic, their cities are built to float and are often found hovering just above the cloud layer. 

Dark elves are considerd to be really nice in Pantaria. They're similar to Canadians and are polite to everyone, even golems. They don't have a sense of racial tension, and will often try and get races that are at war to party. As a result, many believe that Dark elves are morons due to their ditzy nature, but in actuality dark elves are technical geniuses. Designers of crossbows, war golems, semi automatic mage staves and enhanced swords, Dark Elves cornered the market of weaponry and are the leading minds in weapons. The only two races dark elves have any form of animosity towards are Goblins (due to the weaponry market, Goblin tech is at a disadvantage due to 'accidental explosions')  and Light elves.Dark elves love dwarves due to their mutual love of beer and it's pretty common to see dark elf and dwarf couples getting married.      
  




 The LGBT community in Pantaria isn't a big deal. Sure, gay relationships happen, but one's sexuality doesn't matter when it comes to jobs or marriage. For example, a rouge named Nate is comedically omnisexual, wanting to and implying that he's been in relationships with every gender and species in-universe. He isn't seen as a pervert, just odd due to his mannerisms. Gay teachers are as common as heterosexual ones and aren't discriminated against. Yet the central romance plot is between two humans and is heterosexual. 
I like to portray odd things as normal and accepting the LGBT community is one of the ways that I do it. Plus I can always have a different types of romance to spice things up. 




 Hey Zoey,
I understand how rough things are. My parents and I, all the way across the world in Texas are praying for you! And rember, you're not alone. You have the Yognauts behind you! 




 You need to get an orangutan from the zoo and act like everything's normal. 




 Sir Pratchett would be proud 




 However, it would be awesome if the community did. Considering how devoted some Yogs are and how skilled they are, I'd love to see concept art or something. 




 Hey Yognauts! I've been playing a lot of Leauge of Legends and I wondered, 'what if the Yogscast had a MOBA?' So my question is, if the Yogs made a MOBA, what would their stages, abilities and class types be? 




 We need five different versions of the Yogs from different universes
-Apocalypse World: A post apocalyptic world where all the Yogs are irradiated and use Road Warrior style weapons and skill trees. When in play these Yogs decrease the enemies speed and inflict a 'Fear' debuff that prevents a turn at random

-Super Yogs: A world where a particle accelerator exploded, giving a portion of humans (and dwarves) superpowers. The Yogs are a superhero team. When on the board, all allies gain +5 strength and speed.

-Agents of J.A.F.F.A.: In a world like ours, a covert team created by Canadian, American and British intelligence was formed to protect the internet. These agents wear the same black suit and tie (except for Agent Zoey, her tie is rainbow colored). When in play these Yogs provide a special buff called 'Back up' that increases the strength of allies. 

Dog Yogs: A universe where dogs are the dominate species, the Yogscast consists of dog versions of the normal cast (have fun with the breeds). These cards have a special buff called 'Healing Slobber' that can heal allies or cause minor corrosive damage on foes.

Dragon Rider Yogs: Set in a universe where people ride dragons, a mercenary team called the Yogs, travel to various lands with their dragons and have adventures. These cards are cast two at a time, one card being the dragon rider, the other being their dragon. The Rider card and the dragon card must be on the field at the same time in order to use their unique dragon breath ability. (Sjin's Chili Burn, Rythian's ender flame, Kim's Flux breath ect.)

 




 Plague, I intend on keeping the guild! I was partially inspired by Welcome to Nightvale and The Discworld series to make some of the weirder guilds just for fun. In each story, a new guild will be added and mentioned. In my first book, Death Seekers, there's a guild of Those who stand near street vendors. In the next book, Son of Magik, there's the guild of plague masks. The guilds aren't actually a major factor in stories, but sometimes they'll be hired by the Adventurers Guild to do some unsavory task.  




 In order to be edgy in Pantaria, teenagers tend to wear necromancer robes, even if they don't have any skill with magic. If they aren't into magic, they can start internships for major guilds like the Adventurers Guild, Warlock Guild and the Guild of men wearing those hats that make their faces look like concerned pigs. 

Edginess also depends on species. Elves and gargoyles tend to be conservative, so wearing revealing clothing is obscene, meaning that their teenagers wear little clothing to show defiance. Dark elves don't wear much at all, so teenagers dress in parkas, knit caps, mittens and (perish the thought) scarves. Even Dwarf teenagers show their edginess by hanging out with elves, snorting gemstones and engaging in illegal golem construction.  




 Now I really want Telltale games to make a Tale's from the Disc series. 




 Well how am I going to find a realtor now? 




 Happy birthday Simon! 




 Dear Redditors, today I felt very sad. The man who inspired me to become a writer has passed, but now I feel like I'm going to finish my project because of this. As a tribute to a man who, while not as well known as J.K. Rowling or Tolkien, as touched many more hearts, broke down barriers and inspired this shy young man to become something creator. And as I see Death take Sir Pratchett into the great desert, I thank that man for all that he's done for our world and the Disc. 

It's been a wild, heartwarming, horrifying and hilarious ride through a place that never quite made sense, and still doesn't. But that's the beauty of his stories. They parallel our world so much that I can't help but think that's what he was telling us. The world is crazy and full of the evil,the good, the morally ambiguous and potatoes. 

So, to Sir Pratchett I say good night, not with a heavy heart, but with one that is enriched with the lessons, joy and heart that I have learned from you. Good night Sir , good night. 




 I don't see why someone from inside the department wouldn't do this. He or she would be angry enough at possibly losing their job to an uprising of people they once suppressed for so long. Now is the chance to try and stop them and make them out to be the bad guys, knowing that the news will blow this whole story up and out of proportions.  




 Hey Redditors. Why can people just put on masks and police the streets themselves? Likes a neighborhood watch. 




 Sensory deprevation sphere with speakers hooked up to the inside and a tv. My target can either play sonic 06 or be forced to listen to bad music. 




 Hey Redditors! Just asking for some advice. It's my first year being a volunteer at Quakecon with my two friends, and I'm not sure what position to apply for. My primary skills are in writing and video production. 




 Hey Redditors! For a few months, I've been talking to this girl I met in my college English class. I want to ask her out for pizza, but I'm really nervous. I can't drive, and this is a major source of worry for me. Help! 




 My name is Martyn Littlewood. For five years I was stranded on an Skyblock with only one goal - survive. Now I will fulfill Toby's dying wish - to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning You-Tube. To do this, I must become someone else. I must become something else. 




 Well, my birthday just got sad. 




 Why not Mac? I understand that PC players will lose their minds when I say this, but I'm a gamer too. 




 If anyone can do it, you can! 




 Damn. Nice. You should do one with the Buffy theme.
