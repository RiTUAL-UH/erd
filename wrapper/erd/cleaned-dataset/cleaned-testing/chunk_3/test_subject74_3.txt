 Last time I got a BMI test done at my ymca that included a body fat percentage...It was around 24.1% and my waist is around 27 inches. So, according to that I'd be average.  




 I will be honest with you, I do not like what I see in the mirror most days. It's easy for me to pick out the flaws instead of 'good parts'. And I don't receive compliments very often.  




 My BMI is 23.4, which is on the higher side of normal weights based on the calculator I used...Now, I'm 5'1...124 lbs...and I'm a 19 year old female...Is this a normal weight for my height and age? I've been made to feel like its not by most BMI calculators etc. I also gained a lot of weight in the past year...I started community college last year and gained 20 lbs. I used to be 110, so I've lost about 6 lbs since I gained weight. I think this might be why I'm so worried about my weight but I'm interested in getting opinions as mine may be biased. Any advice is appreciated.  









 I find after 2 coats its looks opaque on my nails, I absolutely love it...Maybe try a clear coat over top if you're finding it too thin?  




 the ring and pinky finger designs look a little busy but besides that I think they look absolutely lovely. :)  









 Yeah, I'm learning its better just to do it myself! haha, mine don't turn out every time but atleast I'm only paying out for polish and remover! I totally agree with you, I'd feel soo bad if I couldn't give someone exactly what they wanted for their mani. I'm sure your nails always look beautiful, they definitely do in the now picture! :)  




 Same!!! The red I used for dots bleeds too so that definitely didn't help things. haha. 




 Yeah, you're definitely right...I didn't wait long enough for it to dry...I thought I did but I didn't. And I didn't have any clear coat besides glitter. I know for next time though! In hindsight I should've left them white with the purple and pink middle piece. It looked tidy.  









 I paid $70 for a mani and it looked like the then...Except she couldn't even do designs and she was the only in house nail 'artist'....One of the nails broke in half on me 2 days later...She told me it was gel and that it could only come off with an electric file or acetone remover...I basically filed it off after one of them broke... 




 I found leaving mine alone and not painting them for about a week or less always got rid of it.  




 No problem! And I am too, it's a really shitty experience for her to have during her second tattoo...I told her most artists aren't like that and everything and she seemed to get it but I'm sure she's holding off on getting more for awhile.  




 yeah, she moved once...told the artist it really tickled and apologized for moving and then stayed still.  




 Also, my friend is 18 and still fairly new to being tattooed so...she does have a bit of leeway in my mind...  




 She was a guest artist so I don't think I'll ever see her around again. But, if anyone asks me about my opinion of her ever I'll keep chode in mind as a describing word.  




 Admittedly she was, I cringed at her behaviour and didn't encourage it at all, but it still didn't justify the reaction from the artist in my opinion. She's even been  tattooed before and wasn't an annoying client at all. I was honestly very surprised by both of them but I expected the artist to react in a professional manor.   




 I will try to get a picture, its my friend's tattoo though so I don't have any on hand. lol.  




 I thought so, but I wanted to make sure! haha, I do too definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.
