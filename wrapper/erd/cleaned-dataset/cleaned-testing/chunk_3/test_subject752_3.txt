 As we live in a 'destination' area usually frequented by locals and visitors this aroused by suspicions a bit.

Mindful the neighbours car was broken in to a couple weeks back  I rang local police to report the van in case. They offered some friendly advice which in retrospect seemed obvious - just go and talk to them? 

So I went out, had a quick chat. It was an Asian couple, they spoke very broken English but the gist of it was they had just arrived in NZ, and were going on a long trip and wanted to make sure they were comfortable driving with the new car, and were used to driving on our roads before they headed off! They kept repeating "Safety!".

I thought it was very nice of them to take the responsibility so seriously. 

I just wanted to share this with you all to highlight the vast majority of tourists are responsible on our roads, it's just the incompetent arrogant few who ruin it for the many. 









 Yeah, a con artists who has set up a grant to inspire young inventers.. [What a total wanker.](http://www.jamesdysonfoundation.com/) /s 




 Jesus, little wonder you guys have no faith in your police or judicial system. Really can't blame you when they don't even give you a choice like this. 




 Your police and bureaucracy really really suck shit. I guess we should appreciate what we have in nz then. Appreciate your comment to help me gain some insight. 




 That is some fucked up shit. Ok, I understand where you're coming from, but they're looking for a reason to target you. By obeying the law you're rendering them toothless, powerless to stop you. Isn't that kinda empowering in its own right?  




 Why? For the record I'm from NZ, so this kind of shit very rarely happens here, we have a very different attitude to our police force (at this stage.) so please help me understand?

 




 Fucking beautiful. 

Their critique was cringeful to watch, it was an unabashed insult laden chastising that was uncalled for. Then **to insinuate he could be a mass murderer because of the fact he took pride in his appearance and you think he wanted to dress like  you**??? That's just makes you look like an arrogant fucktard.

Fuck the guy was there to sing, not to be judged for (what I though) was a spiffy looking suit.

He took pride in his appearance, they have no fucking right to put him down because he actually took the effort to look good. 

I honestly couldn't watch their foul mouthed display, I felt ashamed for the guy, on the upside, what a fucking gentleman, stood there and completely took it like a champion without a word of retort. 




 Fucking Americans.

A deranged mental idiot uses any gun he can get his hands on shoot a lot of people..

The gun company didn't give her the gun? I presume they didn't tell her to leave the gun out? I also presume they didn't tell the guy to use their gun? No????? So how the FUCK are they being held liable?!?!  




 Here's a novel idea, don't give the fucking police a REASON to arrest you, and they WON'T arrest you!?

Firstly: 100 people marching with purpose through a city can cause a lot of traffic mayhem.

Secondly: it's fucking expensive to hold up traffic, to get diversions in place and have a police stop the cars because I'm sure they reallllly don't want some impatient git flooring it through the middle of the crowd.

Thirdly: you're protesting against police, which is already getting their hackles up, don't provoke them by breaking the law. Just no. 




 Because (and yes, i'm going to shamelessly paraphrase you here.) Everyone wants to justify sinking a grand's worth of wages into their shiny new toy. 

Judging by the comments on a lot of posts, we have an awful lot of HTC and LG phone owners who frequent /r/Android (Jesus, should have seen when the G3 was rated best phone by the MWC, the mods were cleaning the semen off the floor for days, it was a major circlejerk.) and when the competition does something better they naturally want to bag it to make themselves feel better. Human nature I suppose. 




 That is true. 




 OP, after lurking in /r/android for a few months now, you have a lot to prove as the vast majority here really love bagging Samsung the first chance they get.

I love the figures, but when you have the first decent review:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2yyftj/samsung_galaxy_s6_review_subject_zero/
And the top comment is "Worse battery than last years by a bit. But unless the M9 can blow me away with battery (which in all honesty I expect it to), I still think my next phone will be the S6 ^Edge?"

You're pushing shit uphill trying to impress most of the trolls here that Samsung can produce a good, well rounded device. 
I do admire your effort though!
 




 Interesting to note, however it's almost laughable my year and a half old phone will get to taste lollipop sooner than the newer phone I got 2 months ago..
 




 Just let Darwinism sort them out. 









 Indeed. 

A few select flagship varieties were upgraded first for influential markets to ensure people still bought the device, knowing it was going to be upgraded, however for the markets that they don't think people will buy a phone based upon the latest OS (smaller countries like NZ) they didn't bother releasing the latest ROM for.

(There's a website called "geekzone.co.nz" which allows the tech geeks from Vodafone/Telecom/2Degrees to chat with the users, and they've confirmed as of Feb they haven't even seen the latest Lollipop ROM for any S5's yet. 

So Samsung aren't just scattering them once they've been approved, they're not even bothering to release them to be tested by local carriers. 

Preeeety frustrating. 




 Fucking Censorship.  




 They've upgraded more of the very limited market S4 - i9506 devices to 5.0.1 (about 6 markets last I looked) than they have of my flavour of S5 - G900i (Just fucking 1 market.) So yes. Samsung are so unreliable with lollipop. 




 I love the first line " * Your old warranty is now void." yeah.. like you'd still have a warranty on a 5 year old phone :P 









 A little better than s4, but not by much, biggest benefit is water resistance. 
Camera is not that much better, fingerprint scanner is really awful, heart rate monitor is a piece of shit.  




 Interesting, thanks for clearing it was up. 









 That's kinda fascinating, any idea she was possible of this?  




 It's pretty fucked up. 

There are kinda two things you have to no morals to fuck with: charities and cancer. 









 But the s5 has the proprietary iso cell camera module making it more perplexing why they're shafting their customers.
 









 As an s5 owner all I really hope is they enable "pro shooting mode"on the S5 too, because ignoring the camera2 Api on the s5 lollipop and then releasing this feels like they're kneecapping the camera to make the s6 more appealing to camera enthusiasts. 




 Then I would say it's probably not a genuine screen, and if possible place it size by side with a genuine amoled, s3-s5 you'll quickly notice the difference. 

Also check out your screen options, you may have it on cinema, change it to dynamic?  




 Did you replace it with a cheap third party or genuine screen?  














 Could they suck from Samsung's teat any harder? Seriously.. 




 Good Night Sweet Prince. 




 That also works 




 They have their laws, we have ours. What I was attempting to draw is the fact that the laws are quite disparate despite the same crime. 




 Maybe a little. 




 FUCK NO. More highlighting the completely different approach the different countries have.
Yes, the amounts were significantly different, but this women was a repeat offender, and got off very lightly. 

Then when you compare to do something similar in Indonesia and the comparison is pretty fucked up. 




 Is there a reference I'm missing? 




 Same crime, but completely different attitudes. It's posted as a reflection to how out of whack the laws are. 









 Fucking racist cunts.  




 This is true. There's a final moral line between sucking off the ego of the device manufacturer, and providing an accurate and fair assessment of the device. 

Most review websites fail this moral test, and lean towards the former, and as you said - ensuring a steady and good income due to relieving further devices, not matter how many people they piss off due to them using their ego wank review as the basis to buy their next shiny toy, and then find out that actually the review didn't mention this fatal flaw which actually makes it a piece of shit.... 




 Thanks, just read the review. Most honest review I've read in a while, I loved how they specifically picked up on the awful screen which also plagued the original Flex device.

The funny (!) thing is I was utterly slammed on /r/android for picking this up on an early review of the G Glex2 after a youtube pre-release benchmark was released. I insinuated it was not an accurate test due to only running 1 benchmark at a time (and unknown cool down period between) and people left more than a couple of unsavory comments as a resut, so I think there are more than a few people who just don't want to know the truth sadly, and the review websites are pandering to this. 




 Right, I believe you, but no-one mentioned this on any reviews I saw, which makes sense as if I were Qualcomm I'd be careful curating news as well.  




 Reviews. Performance wise, it's not stellar, but reviews have not mentioned overheating. (Or none I have read anyway.)

If Samsung, Sony are having/had issues why is LG able to pump it a legitimate phone toting the 810 chip. Either the reviews experienced some serious heat issues and stayed quiet, or the issue isn't as big as everyone is making out to be? 

Don't get me wrong, I hate LG, but if they can make this SoC work, why can't anyone else?  




 How can the LG g flex do so well without overheating then?  




 Holy shit the Verge are like love sick puppies with their nose shoved so far up Apples ass they eat at the same time. This line made me fucking sick:

"Thats the same approach that Apple took when it expanded its iPhone lineup last year with some long overdue larger devices, and the ***payoff for that move was the biggest sales success in corporate history.***" 




 Can we stop calling her stupid?

I don't think she thought at all, you can't apply rational thought to someone in that scenario to be honest, your adrenaline takes over. Judge her all you like, but we have the benefit of hindsight. 




 Why would they bother? 

Pharmaceutical companies have squillions of dollars to fight any legislation and even go so far as to actively inventiveness doctors subscribing needless amounts of medication. 

I'm not saying it's not a problem, but it's just not worth it -not in the current political climate anyway. 




 Admittedly they've had some bad fucking luck, but surely shit like this should be picked up by routine checks? 

Any aircraft engineers care to weigh in? 




 Fucking cunt bag mother fuckers. NZ misses out again. Fuck you Google. you Magnificent fucking cunts. 




 I have to wonder how many parts of Android that most users never see, and never appreciate. For instance the (other than default) lock animations, or features they never knew existed like Face unlocking.

Has anyone ever seen you use your phone and gone WOW! and you've shown them their phone can do it too? 









 Don't know.. Nothing came up via Google, but you may honestly have to ask a Japanese historian. 









 HTC are barely treading water in the mobile market. Only so many people want a certain type of device.

Samsung have realised this, and done a more shot-gun approach of have a device for every piece, none particularly great, but adequate. This failed when their flag ship's sales weren't great. 

Oppo/One Plus have gone for cheap but good market, which is serving them well so far.

HTC have gone for the same market, 3 years running. You can only satisfy so many people in the world with 1 thing, before people start asking for alternatives.

Yes, their design **was** great, and won awards, but if they want to survive they either need Apple's iSheep affect to help the same thing, or they need to adapt.

They have not adapted by upgrading the Internal's, as one commenter on here mentioned, his 2 year old M7 is still more than adequate due to the chipset, so upgrading the internals is not adapting, as this isn't a very marketable changed this only serves to illustrate my point they have failed to innovate by upgrading their chipset with the same externals!

I mean people are arguing with me - saying that the people who bought their old device complained about certain features, which were then changes. 

So are you telling me HTC are marketing to the same people who buy their old devices? Again, they're going to/have already hit market saturation in some areas, so I was looking for some diversification from their design, or at least a better enhancement than a purely under the hood modification.  




 You're missing the point. But very well. 




 But I want an HTC with options.. In NZ the Mini isn't stocked by any major retail outlets, our options here are either a mid-range Desire, or the One. 

You're saying if you want a larger screen, go for a different manufacturer, from a marketability point of view that's an appalling attitude - we're not going to cater FOR any other market, other than the one we're been catering to for 3 years now. 

... Yeah, cause that's a sound business model. 




 I'm not arguing it was once a beautiful piece of kit, however consumers needs and demands change a lot over 3 years. As they don't release many other models (and certainly those don't tend to go to the same markets as the one does, they are making up consumers minds for them by saying this is the only screen size you need. Or this is the only design of phone you should ever want. 


That is arrogant. And as I mentioned, design awards aside people slammed Samsung for "evolution over revolution" with their devices, yet praise HTC for doing the same damn thing year after year? 

The review websites are very carefully avoiding mentioning the design copy paste. It's fucking hypocritical to the max and I'm so over the tall poppy syndrome. 

You tell me you aren't disappointed the same designers who made the original m7 have failed to improve upon their design in ***any way shape or form?*** 




 But  




 They've at least done consumers  a favor by increasing the screen size and pixel density for goodness sake! HTC have been arrogant shits and stubbornly kept the same size, same pixel density!  




 All I have to say: **it's the same fucking phone design for 3 fucking years!** 

***3 God damn years!***


That's just lazy and shitty. 




 I would argue, citing Samsung and Sony as two prime culprits who have done this - produced very similar looking devices year after year and they have subsequently had their mobile divisions post significant losses.

As the pundits loved to say about the S5 - "Evolution over Revolution" simply isn't enough to stay relevant in today's fast paced mobile industry.

A good example of this is Samsung - they are rapidly faced with losing their (once lion's) share of Android sales. 

Should your logic ring true the sames of the S5 was released with no major cosmetic changes (argueable of course) over the S4, sales tanked.

As a result, faced with a do or die situation (which may be overstating it..) they have done a complete about turn on two things which were once elemental to their design ethos - SD card and removable back panel.

People may have no design changes presented to them, however the market has shown it will not stand for it, and no manufacturer is totally immune from public opinion swaying against them if they feel like said manufacturer is merely using their brand name as a means to sell products. 

Of course I'd have to be a blind idiot to not realise it's not a significant part of the consumers purchasing decision. However, this is not, and I doubt ever will be the ultimate reason people chose 1 device over the other.

As a result they need a "catch" a reason to say "I'm going with manufacturer XYZ because I like their design ***and this new feature*** is what is making me buy their product.

HTC have unfortunately fallen into this, thinking they can get away with people buying their product purely because they're HTC. Correct me if I am wrong, but by producing the (mostly) ~~identical~~ same product for 3 years in a row is most certainly them telling the consumers "You don't need that extra special feature because ***I, HTC*** have made this."

As I mentioned earlier the only company who could pull this off is Apple. And HTC are as far from Apple as chalk and cheese.

However, if you have examples where you believe this may work, I am more than open for a good discussion! :)  




 For those supporting the move - the Snapdragon 615 is shat on by the 801.

[See GSMArena's review of the HTC Desire 820](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire_820_dual_sim-review-1198p5.php)

Antutu: 27070 
vs E8  (Snapdragon 801) 46857

Yeah.. They are so utterly kneecapping the M8. There's no if, buts or maybe's.
 









 Actually he's quite correct - in NZ at least in Oct 2013 when the 5C and 5S were released. 
Facts and source below.

The iPhone5 was $800.

 Severely disappointed it's not an ISOCELL sensor, but clearly that either was a gimmick, or wasn't ready for version.2 in time?

Also such additions as motion tracking autofocus is extremely awesome.
 




 HTC are basically admitting they're fucking useless and suck ass at innovating, so they have to cheat by kneecapping their old phone in order to sell the new one.

They are admitting there's little reason for people to upgrade otherwise, and it's the fucking losers option to destroy the competition (their old phone) rather than produce a device which they know will sell on it's own merits. Because it won't, because it's a fucking clone of the previous 2 versions before it.

And furthermore, EVERYONE fucking bagged on Samsung for "evolution rather than revolution" with their S5 product, but HTC have done it for 3 years in a row, and everyone thinks they're fucking Gods. 

The phone industry are a bunch of fucking hypocrites with a severe case of tall poppy syndrome. 

This is what you've all created: The retarded child in the family who won't amount to anything because everyone keeps telling them they're doing a good job rather than telling them to do better. 




 Exactly, even they weren't stupid enough to think they could get away with the same shit. Again, HTC do it, and people think it's the best thing since sliced bread. I mean where the fuck is innovation? Innovation isn't using the damn processor as everyone else. Or using the same fucking camera sensor as everyone else, it's putting up new ideas, and actually standing by the choices you make. 

As HTC have shown however they are not innovators, they are fucking sheep who don't even have the balls to work on their ultra-pixel camera. And everyone is actually congratulating them for this phone!? And looking forward to it!?! The same crowd who called for Samsung's blood for daring to release the S5 which was "too similar to the S4" and yet here we have the SAME PHONE 3 years in a god damn row!

/rant./ 




 But everyone slammed Samsung for making a phone that remotely looked like the predecessor, however HTC do it and everything thinks it's God gift to the world. Fucking hypocrites.  




 Let's be honest here, most people already have a perfectly functional device, it's the WOW factor that makes people crave the latest.

Makers are slowly realizing they need a "Buy This MotherFucking Phone, It Will Make All The Girls Panties Drop at the mere site of your awesomeness."

One needn't look any further than Samsung thinking they could get away with largely a "Me too" phone with their Samsung S5. Not even ~~waterproofing~~ water resistance or a dodgy heart rate monitor could help the fact that the phone largely feels like a S4 in your hand. 

Potential owners need a flash factor, something that makes people go: "Wow, what's that phone?" It makes them feel good, and helps to avoid buyers regret.

However HTC have missed the boat entirely. If customers want a good HTC phone, they could very easily go with the M8 and not miss anything from the new version.

Put it this way: 

Your contract is up, you walk into TMobile, and go excellent, I can get a new phone!

How a layman sees it while looking at what phone to buy:

**Screen:**

* M7: 4.7 FHD

* M8: 4.7 FHD

* M9: 4.7 FHD

**Design:**

* M7: Aluminum unibody

* M8: Aluminum unibody

* M9: Aluminum unibody

**Operating system:**

* M7: Lollipop

* M8: Lollipop

* M9: Lollipop

**Speakers:**

* M7: Front Stereo

* M8: Front Stereo

* M9: Front Stereo

**Camera:** 

* M7: Takes photos

* M8: Takes photos

* M9: Takes photos

Why would you walk out of that store with a phone that looks and feels just like the 2 year old phone sitting next to it?.. 

Most people won't - they will turn to the Samsung for a larger screen, or Sony or Samsung for ~~waterproof~~ water resistance, or Huawei for a cheapie to tide them over. 

There's just no justification why most people with last year (or the year before) should upgrade to this model. 

Don't get me wrong, people will buy it, but there's zero WOW factor, and this will cost HTC sales to their competitors. 




 Yes. I thought it was so obvious I didn't bother putting /s. However I was wrong. 




 Very true. 

They really couldn't afford to rest on their laurels this year, and they don't have the Apple Effect^ to pump out a "S" version and think people will buy the new thing.

Same screen size as M8, same exterior as M8, same speakers (indifferent to most users) as M8, same interface with Lollipop as M8.. 

The users aren't going to notice (largely) a 'beneath the hood' CPU/GPU or RAM upgrade, as most aren't power users who benefit from alt+tabbing.

They needed to make current M7/M8 owners jealous, they have not succeeded.
 




 Samsung are losing significant market share in China and they can't afford to:
http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prHK25286814 




 Upvoted for the good memory. :) 




 I noticed the complete lack of OIS has been glossed over by bloody everyone.

As Sammy proved, even with a redesigned sensor (ISOCELL) you still need OIS backing it up for lowlight photos. It's a no brainer. 




 [This (and other sources)](http://www.amta.org.au/articles/amta/Brazil.Russia.India.and.China.emerging.middleclass.drives.extreme.mobiles.growth) show China as a new emerging market which isn't near saturation point for mobile growth yet. As a result Sammy have heavily leaned on Asian design culture for the S6 in a unbridled effort to grasp some of that newly available cash. 




 The West are a very well saturated market, the current expanding market is China. As a result they're pandering for an asian design taste rather than Western design taste. 




 the S5 has a fucking awful fingerprint scanner. How this got past quality assurance in the first place remains a mystery. 




 I think Apple are also eagerly licking their lips in preperation for the "looks like an iPhone6" law suits.. 




 I think a lot of people (Especially S5 owners) are feeling fucking jipped right now that Samsung COULD have pumped out something like this earlier, but didn't.
 




 Jesus. When he zooms in the quality looks like a hundred dollar point and shoot. 




 I have an s5 after a fortuitous insurance event after an s5 and can happily say they are so fucking alike it's not hard to see why sales tanked fucking hard. 

A better screen? No. 

Better battery? No, same screen on time. 

Better feel? No fucking creaky back panel. 

Better features? Fuck no! Unreliable heart rate monitor, and still too nervous to put anything worth a grand in a pool of water! 

Better phone? Fuck no. Not in any way shape or form. (And I used the s4 for a year for over 6 hours a day every day, so I'm more than an average user and if I cannot really justify this, can't expect most of your average Joe's to do so. 




 Eli5 why does north Korea come across as fucking crazy to westerners. Is their leader fucking nuts, or is there method to his madness?  




 They're like fucking children. No! I don't want anyone else playing with my things! Grow up.  




 We're so fucked. 




 Samsung unfortunately have a lot riding on this. But I fear they've done too much to please those who buy other phones regardless and bag on the Samsung brand than those who are actually loyal to them. 

Tl;dr pleasing the haters only to alienate your core fans = stupid stupid stupid. 




 Thanks, good tips.

My warranty forbids rooting unfortunately so I have to stick with the auto-adjust (which I only need to over-ride when showing old people photos!) black/dark backgrounds, and now using the night theme for Reddit Synch. 




 Yeah, suprising. Still one of the best resources though, obviously not something many people know enough or want to write about. 




 This does interest me, there's scant information real world available to layman who just wants to save a little bit of battery. 

I have an S5 and before than an S4, and on both devices struggling to hit more than 4 hours SOT. I would love to hit more without the need to resort to powersaving. (Where's the point in having a Ferrari while driving it like nanna?!) 




 Well, you don't have to change your wallpaper, to make a small change but still save significant amounts you could change your keyboard theme to a darker one instance 




 It's more small changes can make a big difference. I've changed the theme of Swype to "midnight" to be more dark as in working to get more than 4 hours screen on time on my s5.

Also just downloaded Reddit sync with an amoled dark theme, going to see if that helps. 









 I should also add have you tried scratching the contacts of your battery terminals?

Just with like a pin/knife gently scrape the 'knuckles' of the phonebattery terminals and the battery terminal pads themselves. 




 Just want to say it's nice to have an /r/galaxys4 "please help" post where the OP actually responds to questions! 




 So basically the greedy sons of bitches got told to fuck off? 




 Update: Sports mode has made a significant difference! Thanks /u//Bedk for the suggestion! 









 It's like a leprechaun is pissing on your hand. 









 I agree, and as mentioned I've got a d7000 50mm 18- 140mm however the best camera is the one you have on you at the time! I'll try fv5. Thanks!  









 I think outta around 80/20% 

80 = locals.. But they're targeted by campaigns constantly telling them they're driving like idiots.  




 Awesome! I'll just use sports mode from now. Thanks man, simple fix..  




 Good point, we really don't have the funding/money full stop to afford extra manpower/equipment etc to do this. 




 Yeah.. A bit!  




 Perhaps. I did in rarotonga, took 15 mins, happy to do it again. 




 Makes sense. To plead arrogance to such an infamous icon is a tad weird though.
 




 Couldn't agree more. I recently went to Dunedin, most of the trip was alright, but we got a lot of 130km/h in passing lanes, 80 every other time.. Dangerous overtaking etc.  




 You could find extremes like this in every scenario, regardless of whether they're a kiwi or not. 

Foreigners are however quite bad down south in comparison to the rest of the country. I can't recall stats, but they're not great. 

We have ad campaigns targeting our bad drivers, drink drivers, stoned drivers, tired drivers and angry drivers, but there's very little in the form of foreign driver campaigns. (They're are recently putting some in place, but I don't think it's widely advertised enough). 




 You misunderstand my statement, I mean we have no idea how they got their license, no idea if they walked into the testing station, drove around the block and were handed a license. 




 Why is that? The police/government are such hypocritical pricks.

They say "Driving is a privilege not a right." 

But then argue "You passed a potentially arbitrary driving test in a completely foreign country, with rather different road laws to New Zealand but yeah, of course you absolutely have the right to drive on NZ roads." 




 I saw that.. My heart goes out. I've driven that road recently, they would not have stood a snow balls chance in hell of avoiding a collision, and now that driver has to live with the fact he was in control of the wheel when that poor girl died. Just fucking tragic. 




 Thank you for providing some context to their actions. That's crazy.... 









 No, we should keep helping out elsewhere - like peacekeeping efforts to allow other countries to focus on ISIS etc. 




 Million (trillion?) dollar question. 




 Thank you for the suggestion It's not preinstalled, but I'll grab it from the Samsung store and just leave it in that mode 




 Sorry, yes, damn I should have picked that up. 




 Thank you, to the layman like me this didn't make sense, but your explanation provides sound reasoning. 




 Good point.  




 Pretty much this.

I talked to someone recently who'd read the Koran and he realised how utterly futile it is to try and reason with them, so what can you do? 

Can't kill an ideology, you can't reason with it and you can't change their beliefs. I don't think most people get this. 



















 I'm not envious of ARS at the moment, they have the unenviable moral dilemma of raising the profile of this, at the same time as letting potential attackers know who otherwise wouldn't have bothered/thought about using this to their advantage.  




 Hi /r/Android I just basically want to try and understand why Samsung have a hard-on for using rediculously low expsosure times on a hand-held camera.

I have a 6mth old child, so naturally he's always moving, and as I've recently upgraded to a Galaxy S5 over an S4 I was really looking forward to taking semi-decent quick exposure photos.

I've been horribly disappointed that basically the bloody camera defaults to an (obscenely low)1/33 for EVERY scenario and just alters to ISO to cope, except for extremely bright scenarios!

To back this claim up I've gone through my photos and summarized the settings the camera chose:

* In a well lit pool environment (Shutter 1/33 ISO250), 

* In a zoo on a sunny day (Shutter 1/33-1/110 ISO40-80), 

* At home with good natural light (Shutter: **1/17-1/20** ISO 320-100) 

* And out and about (Shutter **1/15** ISO400)

Even with an APS-C sensor D7000 with 50mm F2.2 fails to take decent photos at 1/17 hand held for goodness sake! And coupled with Samsung's utterly bullshit excuse for *software image stabilization* you just cannot use the damn camera for any sort of even partially low-light scenario with even slow moving objects!

To make matters worst I've taken photos with the iPhone5S and iPhone6 and noticed that..

* They take higher ISO photos.

* They have vastly superior software image stabilsation.

After having used the S4 *(which I usually didn't even bother to try and take quick photos on as it barely focus in anything other than perfect burn-your-retina bright sunlight)* for a year, I'm really disappointed in Samsung for doing very very little in the image stabilization department, I had hoped they would utilise the ISOCELL sensor to increase the shutter priority and allow for higher ISO's but this is simply not the case.

I will concede the focusing accuracy, especially in low-light is 99% better, but this is useless if you can focus on your item, but the resulting photos is ruined by the smallest quiver of your hand!

I'm stuck with the damn thing for now, but I just hope them to open the camera API and allow me to use smarter camera software to set higher shutter speed's or at least higher ISO's! 

**(It would appear the arrogant fuckheads have chosen to ignore the new API with Lollipop for now)**

Is there anything I should be doing differently? 

Is there a better Android camera fullstop which will produce faster photos? 

What do you think, am I just being a whiny little bitch? 




 Pulse was good until they decided LinkedIn was an awesome partner and changed the GUI dramatically and made a perfectly functional application into a an utter dog.

Took them many months to recover from that.
