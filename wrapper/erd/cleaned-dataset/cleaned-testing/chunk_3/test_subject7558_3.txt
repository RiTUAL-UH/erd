 I don't care for your books.
 




 That combination has been known to cause uncontrollable cravings for wieners in the people who take it. 




 Well it would be one thing if it was a fresh leaf, but to put dry leaf in your mouth? Fuck that. 




 Brother.. you ain't gettin the tingle in your sacknuts? 




 Call their post office. If they aren't willing to hold it for you, UPS or FedEx will for sure.  




 Load a turkey baster up with hot butter. Get naked. Lay in fetal position. Insert turkey baster into bunghole. Have friend jump on bulb of turkey baster. Keep your mouth closed when he jumps on it so it doesn't fly out your throat. You're welcome. 




 Just mail it to your destination. 




 Well... As much as I love a good back and forth with a mentally retarded person, I'm gonna have to cut this one short. I hope you figure out your complex problem without giving yourself an aneurysm. Take care. I love you. 




 Well, you implied the guy was retarded, like he didn't understand that dipping a wet spoon into a bag of kratom was bad. All I was doing was pointing out that he probably didn't fucking mean to do it that way. If you weren't such an asshole about his advice, I wouldn't have said what I did. See how that works, pumpkin? 




 Kratom. It'll give you a tingly feeling in your ballsack.....
...Kratom. Toilet paper now lasts 3 weeks.....Kratom. You won't want to beat your girlfriend as much.....Kratom. Shitting like a rabbit is great...... Kratom. Gagging never felt so good. Unless you're gay. ......Kratom. Boners were never really that important anyway. ....Kratom. Crying when the mail's late is normal, right? .....Kratom. So good even your eyeballs will be staggering. .....Kratom. No more wet shits, rim jobs are now game all day long. ......Kratom. No, you dumb slamhog, I don't want to go get something to eat yet. We need to get the fuck home so I can dose before I smack the living fuck out of you. (See number 3) 




 Amps just give me motivation to jack off for like 9 hours.  




 I use their measuring spoon, I just dump it out into a regular spoon each time and then put it in my mouth. It sort of surprises me that you wouldn't be able to figure out a way around dumping the wet measuring spoon back into the bag. 




 Fuck those dirty fuckin cocksuckers. It's shit like that that gives kratom a bad fucking name. Foxykotton. Anybody who buys that shit is directly contributing to kratom's downfall. 




 I would be out in about 3 hours, Kramer style 




 Yes... go there and search "speciosa" in the search bar. You have to do it that way every time if you want to see their kratom. Sorry, I should have mentioned that. 




 I hate to beat a dead horse shill style, but I take RVS every day, and I get it from Herbal Salvation. It's 25 bucks plus 5 for shipping for 105 grams, and it's great. Those numbers you're reading aren't really much to rely on... just get it, start at 2 grams, and go from there. 




 That's exactly the type of program Mac is referring to. It's ridiculous. The one I had to go to recently was $95 for an hour and a half session. There's like 12 people and one counselor. That's almost 1200 dollars they make just for us to sit in a circle and shoot the shit. It's a fuckin joke. I've done plenty of those outpatient programs, and I must say, if you really want help, go to AA or NA. It's free and it's sure as hell a lot more helpful than outpatient programs... unless, of course, you're mandated to go to outpatient, like I was... then we don't have a choice. 




 They're bullshitting you. It's a tactic they use to try to get you to admit you've done something. If your piss test comes back clean, there's no way for them to tell you've ever taken any opioids at any point in your life, period. 




 If it bothers you so much, you could just stop coming here. IDK if you thought about that. I think you might have some sort of mental retardation. 




 If you're getting high on oxy every day, your tolerance will build up to 100 mg in no time. That's a pretty average dose for a regular user. 




 Isn't it supposed to have a money back guarantee? 




 Wtf are you talkin about man. #1: He needs to drop two on an empty stomach and go from there. If he drops three with food in his stomach,  he'll likely not even fuckin feel it. #2: He also needs to wait longer than fuckin 20 minutes before dosing more, you crazy asshole. More like an hour. You might start to feel the effects after 10-20 minutes but they're nowhere near done hitting you at that point. I don't feel the full effects until about 40-50 minutes after dropping it on an empty stomach. #3: It's blatantly fucking obvious that both of those are plain leaf. Anybody who's done even rudimentary research on kratom knows exactly what those fuckin strains are, and they sure as hell know the vendor they came from, seeings how it's the most fucking popular one on reddit... if not the most popular period.  #4: WHO THE FUCK PAYS A DOLLAR FOR A GRAM OF PLAIN LEAF?!?!?!?! Take your shitty ass advice over to r/KratomKorner and keep it over there, dickface. 




 Poppy seed Tizzea. 




 Phew. Thanks for lettin me know man. Appreciate it. 




 Oh shit. I don't have enough posts to message anybody or comment on XDA so I didn't say anything over there, but I didn't realize you were the guy lol. Thanks man. Greatly appreciated. I sent Huawei an email 2 days ago for the unlock code. Haven't heard back yet. 




 Just get the Paypal debit card and use that on sites that accept Mastercard. 




 I wish it was a little more in-depth. 




 Well. Percocet, like anything with "ocet" in the name, has acetominophen in it... I know what you're talking about though. Roxies. Instant release oxycodone. Yeah 30 mg a day isn't much of a hook. NAMSAYIN. 




 This brother righteous. 




 I was just about to say that lol. 




 It makes an unbelievable difference... 30 mg of fentanyl would kill somebody, whereas 30 mg of codeine probably wouldn't even be felt. 




 Kratom used to cause me terrible sinus issues. They've pretty much gone away since I quit snorting it though. 




 30 mg of what opiate? Would need to know. 




 You just gotta get good at spreading the ballskin taut, and then itching it. I love it. Feels like Jesus is touching my nutsack. 




 Ginger root 




 Roger that. Can't blame you there... but if you run into any nausea issues, cop yourself some ginger candy or ginger ale. I chase every ingestion with a couple swigs of ginger ale. 




 Yeah my drugs of choice in order were opiates, meth, benzos and addies. That shit's all behind me now though, thanks to the big K. And yeah man it's only 6 bucks for 4 10 gram samples. No Maha Kali though. I tried asking for it, not realizing they don't give that one out in samples, and I ended up receiving a white vein lol. I was pissed. I just can't bring myself to pay 35 bucks for 100 grams. It won't be long before I cop a kilo of the Red Vein Sumatran from Bikhuk, seeings how it's half the price of HS. Unfortunately they don't have Bali, I'd probably just keep getting that from HS. 




 BLUCKA BLUCKA SUP NUGGAH That would make sense, because the Bali I received gave me more side effects than anything. I'm sure I could have talked to Ken about it but it wasn't even worth the aggravation to me. I use Bali every day, I would have to get it from somewhere else regardless. I did receive a sample of White Vein Indo from them, and that was the first and last white vein I ever tried. Nothing against them, I'm just not into the whites. Gives me wicked anxiety. Funny that I shot meth for 7 years but if I try to smoke weed or consume white vein kratom, I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack. lol. 




 I ordered from MS twice, got Bali both times and I honestly didn't even think it was good, don't even understand what people are raving about. I went to HS and got way better Bali for a hell of a lot cheaper than MS, and I haven't looked back since. 




 If you just ate, don't even bother trying to take any more for a couple hours... it works best if you're hungry when you take it, I usually wait til I feel the first hunger pang come on. Having any food in your stomach greatly diminishes the effects... But you probably just didn't take enough. Take 3 g of that RVT and mix it with 2 g of that Green Malaysian. I love RVT but I gotta mix it with Green Bali to get the most out of it. Redosing is cool if you don't feel like you got enough of an effect, but not if you just ate. 




 I think I would like to own it. 




 Heyyy-ooooooo iOSPoundcake. You made a fine choice. RVT is the stuff dreams are made of. Is that an Apple computer I see? You dirty traitor.  




 I just looked at your post history under your username... you did morphine three days ago. How dare you come here and chastise us. Just because you're a morphine addict doesn't mean you have to drag people who are maintaining a positive lifestyle down with you. Shut the fuck up. 




 I, too, would like to know how much he took. 




 Shoot it into your dick vein. 




 ROGER THAT ROGER THAT TEN FOUR MOTHER FUCKER I CAN DIG IT LOUD AND CLEAR I GOT THAT GINGER CANDY ON STAND-BY READY TO ROLL IF THAT SHIT GETS REAL YA HEARD SICK TWISTED GINGER GAME SO HARD CARTMAN BE HATIN NAMSAYIN  




 YEAH NIGGGUHHHHH THAT'S THAT SHIT I'M TALKIN ABOUT BABY BIG DOG BONERTICKLER STYLE I'MA OVERDO IT AND HAVE A WICKED HEADACHE IN THE MORNING AND EVERYTHING IT'S GONNA BE TIGHT BUTTHOLE 




 AH-CHA-CHA
 




 GOOD THING I GOT THAT RED THAI COMIN IN HOT FROM IDAHO TODAY YEAH NIGGGUHHHHHH STRAIN SWITCH 




 No, I hate whites and Maeng Da so I'm not sayin just mix anything with reds... I'm just saying from my own personal experience that mixing Green Bali with reds gets me exactly what I'm looking for.  




 Oh and mix Green Vein Bali with the Red Vein Borneo, or Red Sumatran or Red Thai or whatever. That's the ticket, boy. 




 It will definitely help with premature ejaculation, but it will have a detrimental effect on your sex drive. It's all about timing. Sex might not seem appealing an hour after ingestion, but you'll last as long as you want to in bed. Or in the kitchen... Basically wherever your slampig likes doing it. But there is a sweet spot, somewhere between 3-5 hours after ingestion... at least for me. A little trial and error is in order... but oh Jesus lord, prepare to pay for it dearly if you decide to quit taking kratom. You think you blow your nut quick now? It'll be ten times worse after you quit, until enough time passes by and you go back to normal... which, your normal is premature anyway. It's quite a predicament.  




 me fuckin too. great phone but desperately needs root.
 




 The doc uses kratom?
 




 Sometimes all it takes to cure kratom-dick is a little of the test_subject7558's eloquence.  




 Are you ready to stop touching children? 




 I wouldn't give kratom to my cat. He has to be ready for peanut butter time at a moment's notice. 




 That's extremely common. Generally speaking, if you execute sexy-time with your old lady, you'll still end up with a boner and the desire to make her fat rolls quiver. You just have to go for it. 




 He wakes up, hits the bathroom for a quick jack-off (his wife is a cunt), and then he uses a trowel to scoop heaps of phenibut into his mouth. Then he mumbles and stumbles for a bit, bumps his head on some things, gets some coffee and walks to work. Then he's set for the day. He says his hands have never been as steady as phenibut makes them. I suppose that's a good thing, considering he's a dentist. 




 What a coincidence. I introduced my dentist to phenibut and now he can't start his day without a phenibut OD-blackout. He says it really hits the spot, gets his juices flowing. 




 Dude, an activation rig consists of a magnetron daisy-chained inline with a 2 farad capacitor (500 volt of course) and a low-fidelity digitizer. Do you even kratom, bro? I feel so bad for people who ingest dormant kratom... my life hasn't been the same since I built my activation rig. 




 Just dump it out into a pile on a GLASS plate, and get a TV remote. Make sure the batteries in the remote are good. Point the remote at the pile while holding down one button for 20 minutes... any button, doesn't matter. After 20 minutes, all static will have dissipated no matter how large the pile. Make sure you don't let go of the button at any time while you're pointing the remote at it or you'll have to start all over again. 




 Huh? Are you being sarcastic or is there something I don't know? Facebook? 




 You are thoroughly entertaining me, and I appreciate it.
 




 WHAT 




 No problem. Glad to help.
