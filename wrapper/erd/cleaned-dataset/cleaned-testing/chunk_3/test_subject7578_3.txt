 I bought a Savage and although I love the guns and firepower, it's very defenseless and it leaves me vulnerable flying around in free mode. This got me thinking that R* need to put on the ability to sell Pegasus vehicles, so if you buy the Savage and are dissatisfied you can just sell it. 

not sure what question i wanna ask but comment your thoughts/ideas/suggestions on this topic.

 my favorite movie of 2015 so far 




 Godzilla and Pacific Rim 




 either Thor: The Dark World or First Avenger

so many people hate on these 2 and I really enjoyed them. (even though Malekith was a pretty weak villain) 




 The Inbetweeners movies
