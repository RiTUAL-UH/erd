 cobra's gunna cobra: cant argue with that..

another gem: we SHOULD make fun of drunk drivers. 




 the question is: what was it used for??

but really i think its fair to use a washcloth with soap to wash your body, i'm sure i know people who do that. I remember thats how we showered when we were kids, but i personally havent used a washcloth in years. straight up soap to skin all the way! 




 Lawlz. Of course. 




 YOU are a fat ...mmBITCH! 




 thats fair 




 shes gunna look super hot lying prone on the couch when her back is out tomorrow, amirite guys??  




 ...is it? i feel like things like winters are cold enough to freeze things... 

although actually i guess the cold beverage may only count as "nice" if you are drinking it while you are very hot, which maybe requires electricity, so since then, sure i could see that. 




 maybe im trying to overthink this but... i dont get it? whos taking off the top? man or woman? does it matter? im definitely overthinking this; help a brother out people! 




 right? 

here's an idea; lets give drunk people tiny razor sharp objects and encourage them to throw them around the bar. 
great work, everyone!

its actually shocking and/or impressive  how rarely you hear about horrible dartgame blindings or maimings.. 

edit: words
