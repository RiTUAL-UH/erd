p.s. the road is awesome 




 you're a serial killer dude 




 No, they are not 




 Also his new book Half a King is set in a world that is similar to Viking culture 




 t-rich 




 I don't think I'd have a problem with anything my children wanted to read at age 15, and probably a few years younger than that. 




 do your own homework 




 * p4p1 nothing very exciting but i'd rather have a 2nd spiritleash

* p5p1 i'd take grove huntress

otherwise some minor disagreements only on close picks that essentially boil down to preference
 




 Looking for a horror novel with a fantasy backdrop, the darker the better.  




 mimicleaf. it isnt great but has good synergy with a lot of U/N cards like spring dryad, tarsus, spiritleash, etc 




 Literally impossible if you're playing on iphone 




 How dare they only offer you 1 steam game for a dollar! The gall! 




 This is one of the major benefits of an e-reader - instant word definition lookup. Don't get discouraged, I was looking up multiple words per page when reading Blood Meridian. 




 How is Master Reboot? 




 The "cheesy" excuse is so lame, a win is a win. Give me 4 nightgaunts and you can call me a cheesy lucksack all you want while I collect my 10 tickets 




 Feast of Snakes by Harry Crews 




 p2p1 warcharger

p2p4 metatransfer

p3p3 gloomfiend

p5p1 i like spiritleash a lot but it isnt that good in your deck. you have a death seeker/nightgaunt but unless you play all three, i think id just rather take a 3rd infiltrator. if you want to go for it though it seems fine, it won't kill your deck either way

p5p2 i think ossuary spirit is pretty much filler, rather take digitize for a trick or a 2nd wurm

p6p1 maybe death seeker since you have the leash, or sonic pulse.
 




 same thing happened to me yesterday with the scarab, but 5 nekrium cards. definitely soured me on the card. 




 This book was really a slog for me. Interesting premise, but horrible, wooden characters. Peter's wife is a walking stereotype. How many times throughout the book does she ask Peter if "this is really happening?" It's pretty clear Shute cannot write women. Commander Towers is unflinchingly rigid and by the book. I had a very hard time believing people would act like this at the end of the world.

The book just follows around these boring lifeless characters who are waiting to die, and don't do anything of note....I don't understand the praise heaped on this book 




 I like Fallen enchantress legendary heroes and civ 5 for reference. Should i get either, neither, both, or something else entirely? 




 GPs are the ideal event for thieves - not even necessarily from the mtg community 




 The game has certainly improved in a lot of ways. They have implemented card crafting, which somewhat alleviates the P2W problem. The game is still not as friendly to F2P as Hearthstone, but it has improved. The introduction of drafts is also a great leveler where you can just focus on that rather than constructed.

They've also implemented drafts and constructed tourneys, which addresses the "not rewarding" problem which certainly existed before - there are actually fun things to do in the game now besides logging in and getting your 3 daily wins.

The game is about as luck heavy as any other CCG is. If this turns you off CCGs probably aren't for you in the first place. 




 Losing a close draft game with next turn kill on board to a level 1 nether embrace 




 Pretty much the only 3 tips you need to know to be able to draft, barring card evaluation.

I will usually let myself level 1 spell during level 1 max. I'm ok with leveling insane ones early (still try for 1 max though) like epidemic, twin growth, or spiritleash. If i can get nice value from it, I might play a spell at Lvl 1 that I can play for free the rest of the game like a contagion surge or primal strike. 




 It's pretty great. I've read some of McCarthy before so I sort of know what I'm getting into, but I still really needed to slow down my reading to catch all the details - and I'm really glad I'm reading it on Kindle, because I'm looking up multiple words per page. The prose as you said is fantastic though, I'm maybe a third through and already there are lots of unforgettable scenes. 




 you get tickets, which allow you to enter tournaments, as daily rewards. You can also buy them with silver (which is also accumulated for free), so yes, it is possible as F2P

 I wish they'd run larger daily tournaments or something other than essentially "who plays the most". I have no doubt most of the guys at the top these lists are good and I've run into most of them, but "most wins this week" just isn't a very interesting stat to keep track of 




 Slam that nightgaunt 




 I guess people haven't played a lot with Scarab, because it's insane. Still probably below Strategist and GGP, but Scarab is miles better than Frostwild Tracker and a card I'm pretty happy first picking 




 towerofthehand.com to catch up on what you've already read. I suppose you could skim book 4 this way if you wanted to, but book 5 was pretty similar, so it wouldn't make much sense to do so 




 97 packs, 5 legendaries, 16 heroics 




 I guess I'm one of the few Ramsay fans... 




 I agree, although the only part I really disliked were the Sam chapters. The Cersei chapters are some of my favorites in the series. 




 I tend to check kirkus reviews, the millions, and book beast, but content can be pretty sparse. I was wondering what the favorite sites of others are, to add a few to my daily routine. Thanks 




 The recommendation engine. Like anything else it isn't perfect, but it has lead me to some interesting reads 




 I did it in the past, but found it lead to me not finishing a lot of books, so I try to stick to one at a time now unless I have good reason otherwise. 




 Encyclopedia Brown 




 Thsi book was really a slog. Great premise, horrible wooden characters. Peter's wife is a walking stereotype. How many times does she ask Peter if "this is really happening?" Commander Towers is just unflinchingly rigid and by the book. I had a very hard time believing people would act like this at the end of the world.

The premise is interesting but sadly the book is about following around these boring lifeless characters who are just waiting to die, and don't really do anything of note 




 Except it's only possible in arena, and your opp needed to draft two yseras in the first place. Guarantee it didn't happen 




 I really doubt that 




 Can't go wrong with anything by Flannery O'connor or Cormac McCarthy. I recommend Donald Ray Pollock all of the time, The Devil All the Time and Knockemstiff are both great. These books lean more to the southern gothic genre.

2666 is a great book.

There's a lot of horror on the list that is good as well - Lovecraft, Ligotti, Barron, Bierce, etc - good as well but not really like True Detective aside from the King in Yellow/Carcosa connection. 




 Winds of Winter 




 Frank Bill, Donald Ray Pollock, Nathan Ballingrud, Jeff Vandermeer 




 you're an idiot 




 Ah, makes sense, thanks 




 Probably a dumb question but how do you trigger it on your own turn? 




 To Train Up a Child 




 Or the lack of any wildly popular books on that list - Harry Potter, Hunger Games, 50 Shades, etc. It might be due to where the sample was taken, but I'm guessing it's actually a "books that are more popular percentage-wise in this state than anywhere else" rather than a "most read in each state" list. 




 I feel like the vast majority of people obsessed with speed reading are people that don't read and don't really want to put the effort in, but would still like to acquire the knowledge.

Seems fine for something like a textbook or something forced I suppose, but I'd never want to use the tool while I'm reading for personal pleasure. 




 You don't have to like everything that is popular. Obviously do not read Blood Meridian if you didn't like The Road. There are plenty of other books out there. 




 OK, there is a background to most of the stuff, so maybe Deus Ex Machina is the slightly wrong term. Nonetheless Stephenson continually uses futuristic technology throughout the book to get his characters out of impossible situations, so I think it applies. Certainly didn't make it any less groan inducing... I mean, he uses the Rat Things twice if I'm remembering correctly - don't they also save YT during the snow crash pickup? (In addition to running miles at warp speed at the end to save the day and take down the main villain?) 




 At the end of book Uncle Enzo literally presses a magical button that destroys Raven and all of his glass knives....guess that wraps that up.

The entire book is full of them. The rat thing coming out of nowhere to save the day, the all knowing librarian... 




 Snow Crash 




 This apple is MUCH cheaper and tastier than this orange! 




 poor guy 




 Lol, so many cheating apologists in this thread. He obviously cheated dum dums 




 Good Country People by Flannery O'Connor 




 The Devil All the Time by Donald Ray Pollock, book is just superb. 




 Can someone explain the gameplay to me? Couldn't tell from the trailer. 




 This lady clearly made a big mistake, I just find it funny that the response to this woman lambasting an author without even having read their books, is the mob mentality equivalent - flooding her amazon pages with one star reviews. People are such hypocrites. 




 Katamari Damacy 




 The Devil All the Time by Donald Ray Pollock 




 Banished 




 Lol, condescending much? Not every Solforge player is a whiny child that needs to be punished. Some of us are just looking for reasonable updates, and a reason to keep playing this game. 




 Then don't use crowdfunding next time if it's such a hassle... 




 Fix WWP please, card has been breaking constructed and draft for months now 




 Just picked up this game yesterday, quick question on trading - Started a game and built some light ships to protect trade interests. Once I became involved in a war, all of my light ships got demolished. Some of it was definitely due to me not paying attention, but what is the general method to protect your trade ships when in war? 




 Regarding the border and her husband, I thought it was possibly a doppleganger, so maybe expedition 11 never really left area x after all and they were all dopplegangers that came back.

Great book though, looking forward to the next two. 




 Here is the barometer test if you will like this game. Do you like Super Ghouls n Ghosts? If you do why the hell don't you own this already? 




 And the award for douchiest article ever written goes to...

 Man, still waiting on an amazon price match...gift cards need to be spent 




 By no means a literary classic, but a fun read 




 The idea that some classics should be retired or are talked about too much doesnt sit right with me. I would never advise someone not to read a classic  Im not in the business of advising people not to read books. A lot of books are dated, but their time may come again. Classics are classics for a reason even if not all of those reasons, or the books themselves, are truly good. 




 Do your own homework 




 No point, LH is strictly better 




 it's a movie buddy 




 White Chicks 2 




 Years of Refusal is good man 




 Annihilation was great! Can't wait until May for the next part 




 Are you new here? 




 He didn't even ask for roguelikes.

* many items which change your style of play - check
* weapons with different attributes - check
* randomly generated levels - check 




 Just came out on Steam. I am a big roguelike/roguelite fan and have close to 100 hrs in Binding of Isaac. This looks similar but looking to hear if anyone has tried it. 




 There are of course legitimate reasons, but it happens far too often for every case to be legitimate 




 As of recently, I'd say more than 50% of my opponents mysteriously go inactive once it becomes clear they've lost, almost always returning once their timer hits around 2-3 minutes left in hopes that I've left to scum out a win.

Some modes it matters a little more than others (play vs. draft), but it makes the game unplayable in bite sized doses unless you're willing to lose or babysit your opponent for up to 15 minutes while doing nothing.

I understand implementing a turn timer or inactivity timer won't universally be an improvement for all, but something should be implemented by SB to combat this, it's a real enjoyment killer. 




 I haven't read this book in about 15 years. I loved it and reread it a few times when I was younger, and I'm now too scared to give it a re-read as I'm afraid it might be something I won't like anymore 




  And that's great, don't get me wrong. But there's a HUGE difference between when new gameplay mechanics are generated, and when they occupy a significant portion of the mainstream gaming consciousness. And indie games almost NEVER do that.

What a bunch of fluff. Why should game of the year be entwined with popularity? Of course indie games never "occupy a significant portion of the mainstream gaming consciousness", they can't compete with the corporate giants in terms of media exposure.
 




 Who cares, his opinion means nothing 




 no kidding... 




 Mockingbird is still good :) 




  Let's restrict it to books between 1800 and 1920. 




 Best I've found is to use a PS3 controller for games where I'd use the d-pad and a 360 controller if I'd use analog stick.

I know you said you weren't a dualshock fan, but I haven't found anything to be better 




 Mockingbird/A Wrinkle in the Skin are not old, though 




 then don't play it 




 and by unantagonistically, you mean comparing a critically acclaimed game many people here like to games designed for 4 year olds? You're an asshole lol 




 Stick to Call of Duty? 




 nope 




 *With Liberty and Justice for Some* by Glenn Greenwald  




 Reading a book a week doesn't mean you are a shut in. I've pretty easily read 4 so far this year by just reading an hour or two before bed each night. 




 you have plenty of time, you just don't want to do it 




 Libraries are free 




 14/17 




  I haven't read a book in 10 years...I would **loose** my mind.

 




 whatever floats your boat chief 




 Why bother eating a steak when there's ramen and easy mac? 




 http://phys.org/news/2013-10-literary-fiction-mind-reading-skills.html

 




 Reading words isn't the same as reading a book. I get what you're saying, and Fallout 1 +2 are great games, but reading dialogue is simply not the same as reading a book. 




 stop watching tv 




 Because it's the quantity that counts, right? They can all spread their knowledge of the man with two penises to the rest of the world 




 That's like saying reading 50,000 words while browsing reddit is the same as reading a book. It doesn't count 




 no 




  I'm alright smart

you sure is

 




 [Steelheart](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17182126-steelheart) by Brandon Sanderson 




 What are the last five books you read? 




 5 is one of the best in the series, sadly marred by horrible battle load times. It would rival 2 if they fixed the load time issue 




 myth 




 Worth getting for Blood Meridian alone, if you are unfamiliar with it. One of the best novels written in the past 50 years. The greatest living author's masterpiece 




 **PWYW**:

* *The Satanic Verses* - Salman Rushdie
* *Stolen* - Lucy Christopher
* *Abandon* - Meg Cabot
* *Junky* - William S. Burroughs
* *Found* - Margaret Peterson Haddix

**BTA**:

* *A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius* - Dave Eggers
* *Blood Meridian* - Cormac McCarthy
* *On a Pale Horse* - Piers Anthony
 




 I felt the same way as you. Enjoyed the story well enough, but the gameplay was a boring collect-a-thon 




 Andersen Prunty 




 Flannery O'Connor's *Everything that Rises Must Converge* and *A Good Man is Hard to Find* 




 wait til you get 400 more dust from something else 




 If you do you will probably regret it at one point when warriors are the flavor of the month. I disenchanted my nat pagle when i started playing and i'm regretting it now 




 **Beyond Good and Evil** - great game with exploration, puzzle solving, areas that are cut off from you until you acquire new equipment, lots of mini-games(photography etc), good boss battles. Well constructed story and characters, highly recommended.

**Okami** - similar to the Zelda games, great visuals, great gameplay, cool paint mechanics, lots to explore, another big recommendation. 




 Seems like this game is just constantly the daily deal 




 indeed
