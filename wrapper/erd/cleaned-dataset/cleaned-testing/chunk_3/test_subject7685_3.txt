 I've been in a crew of 3 with a couple of mates since launch. They're not buying the PS4 version and so I think I'll want to join a crew that does stuff. No roleplaying or anything but definitely fun stuff. I'm an average gunman but an above average vehicle handler.

What does your crew offer in the way of fun/things to do? 










































































 RULES FOR CONSIDERATION:

-They must be somewhat realistic. For example Sonic and Mario are not allowed, but Master Chief and Marcus Fenix are allowed.
- They must be proficient with guns. Swords and fireballs etc don't count.
- They may be male or female.


HAVE AT IT! 






























































































 One of the most strangely fascinating films I ever saw was Waking Life.

Blurb:
A boy has a dream that he can float, but unless he holds on, he will drift away into the sky. Even when he is grown up, this idea recurs. After a strange accident, he walks through what may be a dream, flowing in and out of scenarios and encountering various characters. People he meets discuss science, philosophy and the life of dreaming and waking, and the protagonist gradually becomes alarmed that he cannot awake from this confusing dream.  


































 Think about it. When your wife asks where you're going you can truthfully tell her "I'm going to the future." Say you had to come back home because you forgot your wallet, when leaving for the second time you could say "I'm going back to the future!"

 Hey guys. My oldest and most popular series is Skyrim Roleplay Adventure where I never break the 4th wall.

Here's the first episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_K8F-MGvw

And here's the latest episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qOufdKDD88

Please let me know what you think. 




 Hey guys. I've been making Let's Play videos for a year now and would like to share some of my thoughts of my experience.

My channel focuses mainly on story driven let's plays, my oldest and most popular series is Skyrim Roleplay Advneutre where I never break the 4th wall. In addition to this I have done let's plays of The Last Of Us (no commentary), Gears of War Judgment, Max Payne 3, GTAV, Metal Gear Solid 2 HD (no kills, no commentary) and Heavy Rain Move Edition (no commentary). I also make and upload random videos like GTA montages and I used to make the occasional Black Ops 2 video.

As anyone who does let's plays can tell you there's much more to it than simply playing the game with a mic in front of you, which I wasn't expecting when I started. I think I've streamlined my process a lot since I began doing this last year and the general quality of my videos has improved as the months have passed.

I seem to be plagued by inactive subscribers, although this may be due to my upload schedule. I always stayed away from a schedule because I didn't want this hobby to start feeling like work, but realised my subs deserve content at regular intervals. So I started uploading my two current let's plays of Skyrim and Beyond Two Souls at 8pm GMT on Fridays and Wednesdays respectively. This doesn't seem to have helped my view count at all. I suspect that because the majority of my  views come from America I should start uploading videos at USA friendly times, do you think this is a good idea?

I'm disappointed that I have nearly 300 subscribers but struggle to get more than 15 views per video, after a year of doing this I've only made $25. I've considered giving up a couple of times but then I regain the passion for making the videos and carry on. Another thing that bothers me is that people almost never leave comments on my videos. I welcome feedback and always respond to the few comments that do get posted. Oh well, if they don't want to leave a comment they shouldn't feel obliged to I suppose, but it would be nice to have some interaction with my fans so I can humanise them. For the last year they've just been some intangible force.

Anyway that's my experience after one year of making let's plays. Let's hope the second year is more rewarding.
