 Ok so I got a new rig a while back, and I was dumb and I did ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew in CMD and it has fucked my ping up bad brothers! All MP games are unplayable for me! Any way to fix this? :( 




 Sure! 




 Anything..really. apart from RPGs. Sandboxs are fun. I have GTA V but it's at very low settings, and is hardly playable. 30-24fps [horrible.](https://youtu.be/e-LE0ycgkBQ?t=1m2s) 




 That comment is made up. Obviously the writer is a PS4 Fanboy and is actually secretly a wannabe PCMR. And that is his dream PC. let's help him build it., brothers!

The truth is out there. 














 STWBF2 is getting 30fps too. I think it was my temps. It's kinda fixed now i guess, still pretty bad doe 




 Same to you. :( Shame i wanted to play with you 




 I don't have  GPU ;(.....yet... I use an APU. My old card had to be returned because it came from Ebay...broken -.- 




 Tried it. Nothing found. 




 Ok i'll try that.
Edit: Nothing found 




 Well, I was playing GMOD today and I noticed that the FPS was dropping below 30! It's never happened before, I always got ridiculous framerates like 320... why is it doing this?  




 I'd love to play but I play on PC :( Do you play PC too? Or just PS3? 




 thank you brothers 




 love you 




 Shut up! I'm the real doctor here! You don't even have a degree

 Why not remove some of the useless flairs that are not uses so much like HTPC? 




 No,Yes. 




  It feels like I'm developing for a console :/
HOW DARE YOU? D: 




 D: 




 We are the members. We demand flairs. We want colors. We are not a 1950s newspaper. We are colorful and intelligent. We. Love. This. Sub. 
No longer will we put up with these COLORS.
We will do whatever it takes to get flairs. Even if that means pressing 2000 K70 keys down at once. Prepare your ears, you are in for a ride.  




 It's ok xX_EdGe360n0sCoPeZz_CaSEMasTeRRacE_FazeClanxX_zZ you will soon be part of us.A 




 Why can't we have a few? You know? I'm tired of seeing people use the former PCMR flair. People want orange! Blue is for peasants! #orangemasterrace 

 




 Why not add pages? You know, like a scroll bar! Or somthing? Is that possible in CSS? 




 I was talking like orange and red. You don't have to change anything big... I was maybe thinking like you could remove the color ranking somehow? Mods have exclusive color? The sub would look nicer being more colorful. 




 Yeah! 




 Upvooooohhht if you agree brother! 














 Yeah, fr00b 




 cs:go compet.. if that does not require skill I don't know what does
