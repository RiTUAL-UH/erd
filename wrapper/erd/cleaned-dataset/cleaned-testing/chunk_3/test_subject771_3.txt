I could get all of 4 channels.

Let's see if I put up a 1000 foot antenna:

10 channels:

Let's try a mile long antenna: (5280 linear feet).

Still only 10 channels

 Anybody else remember the first time they heard of "green tech"?  I first heard of it when my boss said "We're going to make our workplace green".  My reaction was "Ew, Why?  Green's an ugly color.  Why would anybody do that?  What the fuck?  But if you want me to paint the houses green, OK."  I got laughed at and I didn't know why. 




 Then having MIG7 aircraft keep on flying over for the entire time, and have troops march by for the entire time, and broadcast it live on TV?  Then he reforms the new DDR, and starts building the wall again?  All immigration and emigration is now shut off to the newly reformed DDR. 




 Then having MIG7 aircract keep on flying over for the entire time, and have troops march by for the entire time, and broadcast it live on TV?  Then he re-forms the new DDR, and starts building the wall again?

 A nigger at the airport:

 Name?

 Tyrone Jenken Brown.

 Sex?

 Three to five times a week.

 No, no I mean male or female?

 Male, female, sometimes camel.

 Holy cow!

 Yes, cow, sheep, animals in general.

 But isnt that hostile?

 Horse style, doggy style, any style!

 Oh dear!

 No, no! Deer run too fast. 












































 Back in 96, I crossed into canada on a band trip.  I got asked 3 questions:  

1.  Do you have any weapons in the vehicle?  (my knife)
1b.  OK, do you have any firearms in the vehicle?  (no)

2.  How long to you plan to be in Canada?  (a week, I want to go to the Edmonton Mall, and I play the bass drum in the percussion section, I'm on a band trip).

3.  Business or pleasure?  (pleasure)

On re-entry into the USA, I got asked one question:

1.  Are you a lawful resident of the USA? (yes)

It was easy to cross international borders then.  Now, I need a passport, and documentation to prove that I'm legally in the USA to even leave, let alone get back.  It's fucking retarded.  Back in 96, I TRIED to show my ID, and they had me put it away, and said "verbally, are you authorised to be in the United States?" I responded, Uh, yeah?  Why else would I be on this bus?  The INS guy just shook his head and said "You'd be surprised", and kept on moving down the line.  

We almost got stopped because we had a russian immigrant aboard, and I'm glad we didn't, because I bought a CO2 pistol in Canada, and was smuggling it across international boundaries.  And some chew too. :)  

But these days, I can't even go to Canada, (or reenter the USA legally), without a passport or an EDL.

**EDIT:** It seems like we're becoming the USSR, and employing the exact same practices we used to ridicule them for.  I guess "Welcome to the USSA:  Land of the Fee, Home of the Slave." 














 I have a 15" sub that's been doing nothing for the last decade. it still worked when I took it out of my rig back in 2002, and I just never got around to installing it again. I realistically will never install it in my vehicle again, but I don't want to get rid of it because it cost me over $500 back in 1999. I want to hook it up to my home audio system. How would I go about doing this? It's just the speaker, not amplified. 









 How well does it work for decrypting QAM channels? 


































 I have a budget of $100. I need to be able to pick up QAM and ATSC TV. Also NTSC, as there is 1 repeater here that still broadcast in NTSC, and the local cable system (basic service), is analog still. What is the best tuner that I can get for under $100? I have money now, so I want a decent tuner for under $100. Antenna isn't really an option here, according to my TV Fool report: www dot tvfool dot com /?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f0978977115 e]. I want ATSC capabilities because I might some day move to an area where I can pick up OTA signals, and an NTSC tuner because we still have an analog cable system here for Extended basic service.
 














 If you go to your clock/calander in the taskbar, single click on it to bring up the calander, and click "more clocks", you get an option for an alarm clock, world clock, countdown timer, and stopwatch. :)  ABOUT TIME!  Now I don't need third party software to do all of this. :) 

















































































































































































































 Such as a 20" CRT TV is easily watchable from 10 feet away, but a 20" LCD TV is hard to make out what is going on on the screen.  Forget about trying to read any text from 10 feet away on a LCD when watching something in SD format. 
























 What is a fairly decent ATSC/QAM box for my TV?  It would be nice if it could receive NTSC signals too, so I wouldn't need to jockey between using the remote for the TV, and the remote for the box, but just use the box.  I have a budget of $100.  Any recommendations? 



















 Microsoft's new browser, formally referred to as "Project Spartan" is officially going to be called "Microsoft Edge".

I wonder if they'll use Aerosmith's "Livin' On The Edge"  to market it, like they used "Start Me Up" from the Rolling Stones to market Windows 95? 





























 Surround baltimore with concentra wire, and make it a "no-go" zone. Ban the media from entering because of "security reasons". Cut the phone lines, power, and water. Disable cellular service, and internet access. Don't respond to any emergencies, and let the place burn down. Close down the hospitals. Nothing gets in or out except for food, which will be air dropped once a day in the form of MRE's. Let it burn. Because of the scum there, that city would shortly turn into a 3rd world hell hole making Mogadishu look like Disney World. They hate police and emergency responders? Fine. Let's see how well they get along without them at all. 























































































































 It's no longer on channel 9, instead I'm getting a station called "Antenna TV".  Where did Fox28 go on the analog feed? 









 [Slow-moving vehicle to pull off roadway.](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.427)

Why does this need to be a law? If you're holding up traffic, PULL OVER! NOT HARD PEOPLE! (queue flashback to 2002 when I threw an engine rod on the Lewiston Hill, and drove in the shoulder, called my mom because my engine blew up, pissed in my radiator just to make it to WA state line to shut off my engine). 

Fuck. If you're holding up traffic, PULL OVER! The Lewiston hill is beautiful at 7MPH, and it takes about an hour to get up it, even flagged by the state bull.  Let them pass, keep on your way, and only get back in the lane once you let everybody by, (optimally, just drive on the shoulder).
 




 I ask because my DL is about to expire, and I honestly can't afford the renewal fee.  I know I can operate a Moped on a standard DL, but what if I can't afford to renew it?  Can I run an electric scooter legally?  Yes, I will wear a helmet.  

If it's faster than a bike, I wear a helmet, (even if only a bike helmet).  I got saved once by a helmet, and I'm not riding anything that has power behind it without one).  But if I can't afford to renew my license/registration, can I get on my scooter and go to work?

I'l keep off of the public highways when I can, but if there's no sidewalk or shoulder, then I'll keep in the right lane.  Do I need one of those orange triangles on my back, (because I'm going less than 35).  No, I'm not getting on the interstate. 









 I'm in Eastern WA, and I just heard a couple robins chirp outside of my window.  Time is now 0148, and it doesn't even start getting light until around 0542.  Why are they chirping in the dark?  WTF? 














 I'm not sure where to put this, as it's not on a physical Macintosh, but it's on a emulated PPC running in SheepShaver on my Windows 10 installation.  I have gotten 9.0.4 up and running fine, but when I try to download the free 9.1 update to MacOS from Apple, it just redirects to Apple Support.  It appears that they have pulled it. Where can I get the free 9.1 update?

 When I upgraded to 10056, I downloaded the wrong ISO, and accidentally changed my Pro TP into Enterprise TP.  I really don't have a need for Enterprise, so when the next release is made available, can I just upgrade the build to Pro, or will I need to clean install?
