 This would be a stupid move on Wilmots case in my opinion. I think Wilmot mismanaged this Belgian squad in Brazil. Though Belgium got as far as some expected after the draw was revealed. I can't help think that he didn't do enough to get Hazard motivated or involve him enough. Hazard at the beginning was tipped to be one of the stars of the WC, but turned out to be a shadow of his usual self. 









 This quote seems kind of odd. I feel like he didn't need to apologize because he wasn't owned by us. If anyone should be close to apologizing, it's Courtois, but even so, I don't want him apologizing either.  Costa didn't have a %100 guarantee of being sold to Chelsea so he shouldn't be sorry for putting on a good *audition*, he should probably apologize to terry for irritating him haha. 




 Ha ok then I don't know. 




 
Hmm, it was working initially... I even checked since I posted it from mobile to see if the URL was different. But now I'm actually having trouble accessing it too. Might be a disruption on their end. 









 Why did Argentina bring Palacios to Brazil with them instead of this man? 




 Separate ways by journey?? 




 Yeah I remember his album with josh where is was basically all guitar instrumentals. And that's an awesome fact about curtains ha 




 Yes indeed, John is a beautiful human being. Now I don't have any knowledge of this, I haven't read any articles or anything. But in his solo albums does he make all the sounds? Not necessarily play all the instruments but maybe does he use computer programs and such? Or does he bring people in to sort of collaborate. 




 I know, he's one of the guitarists that I associate with their guitar. In a sense when I hear him play, it feels like it's speaking for him. He's a pretty eccentric dude so I can only assume that he's been trying to really experiment, and maybe it's selfish for me to tell him what to make, but oh well. 




 Why is this a thread? Seems like Marketing 101 for the 1960's. 




 My other favorites from the album are The Mirror and The Will To Death, gotta love John, however, I couldn't really get into his newest album 




 Zzyzx rd - stone sour, absolutely a great tune 




 Damn, that was good. So now you got me wondering why this doesn't get equal praise. Probably the simple answer, Rise Against being the most recent to do it. Also with the lessening popularity of our involvement in the Middle East, with the video playing a very key role in my experience with the song. 




 i'll have to give it a listen. 




 From my experience, I haven't heard a song that talks about the warrior after the war. And the regret the warriors have when every gratifies them for their "heroism". If there is another song that does this, then so be it. But I haven't heard it 




 This is actually really awesome, is there somewhere he'll be posting the songs or has it already been done by him elsewhere?  




 It seems like English papers get away with posting bullocks 




 Sergio Busquets 




 Even though I feel like the East is getting stronger, it's still not the west... so we have a chance to at least maybe surprise some people 




 Damn, sixers drafted Elfrid before they traded him, woulda been oodles of fun 




 Oh god, that handshake at the end was cringe-worthy. Handshakes bring out the whiteness in all white people. 

Jokes aside.. Lookin forward to Joel's impact in the future 




 I want the Sixers to be above .500 with Nerlens having a good year after recovering from injury his entire rookie season. BECAUSE HAIR. 




 Last Kiss - Pearl Jam 




 Camera Thief - Atmosphere

Make Em Purr - Sage Francis
 




 I've always admired Rise Against for their lyricism, but damn did this song step it up for me. 




 DK in Donkey Kong 64 




 Hey reddit, I see this album mentioned a lot and how it has had a major influence on the history of music. I was wondering if anyone knew any articles that discussed this albums influences or basically anything that would teach me more about this album. I like music history a lot, but this isn't something I've looked into deeply, any comments would be great. 




 I'm just messin around, it's actually a good point 




 Fuck Iggy with a Ron Jeremy dick 




 Wax is back and crack is whack kids  




 EDIT: duh 




 Doesn't lead to a fulfilling climax? Then you've obviously never shouted "oh mama Mia mama Mia" as loud as you can, very fulfilling 




 Innuendo by Queen has some awesome acoustic guitar soloing, definitely worth the listen if you haven't already. 




 I blame Rosie O'Donnell 




 And sisters! You eugenist 




 Wish you were here - pink floyd 




 Nah, I wasn't talking about your whore mother specifically, just in general. The thesis was about the whore in everybody's mom. 




 His name is Simon Carmichael, got his PhD at the age of 16 from Oxford in Computer Science, and his doctoral thesis was on "The correlation between Broadband speed and your moms level of whoreness." Great guy. 




 Black by Pearl Jam 




 I see that album mentioned a lot, could you point to a good article or anything that would help me understand its influence a bunch more? 




 Higher Ground by RHCP is also pretty dope 




 The Scientist - Coldplay

Imagine - John Lennon 




 Ha, I remember their Pants song. I used to think that song was the funniest shit since Ace Ventura. Oh to be 7 again. 




 yeah i get it, god isn't real. 




 That's kinda the joke I'm going for. We all live our lives assuming God doesn't exist. So if we get to the Pearly Gates, we're all gonna say... "shit" because obviously we won't be getting in. Don't think too hard 




 Yep no problemo man, enjoy 









 Good album since nothing for the past like past 3 or 4 years. Sage is a lyrical creative monster as usual, shows a lot of emotion with isolation and heartbreak and such. My favorite tracks are Grace, Make em Purr, ID Thieves, and Vonnegut Busy. But essentially, if you dig Sage, you're gonna dig this album.

Ahh thanks for the clarification, I just always group Sage with those guys. 




 Rhymesayers label produces so much quality. Been bumpin Copper Gone and Southsiders since they came out earlier this year.  




 Lupe is pretty outspoken about his hatred for violence, one of the most well known, and that's what I respect about LUpe 




 And then my roommate looked at me and said, "dude that was totally tubular" 




 You probably think this song is about you don't you, don't you? 




 you mean you don't like that T.I. is gonna "split your ass in two?" :p 




 Link? 




 I remember the first time I heard this. It was a live performance on one of the late night shows. And I was like, "Holy Shit, what was that? That was great" 




 Have you ever listened to a song and it seems to really gel with you, except there are lyrics that just don't click? This is how I feel sometimes, and it can be off-putting. However, these songs I'm about to mention, I still listen to and love.

The two that come to mind off the top of my head are "Champagne Supernova" by Oasis and "Human" by The Killers


I know Champagne Supernova is the most famous one, but can't go without being said.


* Champagne Supernova "Slowly walking through the hall, faster than a cannonball..."

EGAD! Does not compute  [The moment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3C7DECI0jU t=0m43s)


* Human "Are we Human? Or are we Dancer? My sign is vital. My hands are cold"

I don't get it, does anyone? [We are Dancer, I guess](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIZdjT1472Y t=0m43s)


This isn't a thread about the worst lyrics, I'd like it to be the lyrics you'd like to change to otherwise good songs.


Conspiracy theory: Both songs occur at the 43 second mark... dun dun dun

Thanks! 




 Lover of the Light and Dust Bowl Dance by Mumford and Sons. And War Song by O.A.R. 









 I love RHCP, and even though a lot of redditors really dig BSSM, I think Stadium Arcadium is my favorite Frusciante workings for RHCP

I'm not a big Beatles guy so I won't witch hunt you about Lennon, even though Imagine changed my life (post-Beatles I know). And as for Thom Yorke, I really like about half of Radiohead's discography, and the other half I just like. And from the interviews and musical talks it seems like Thom gets a lot of the shine, but you'd be better off asking someone else. 




 *Marcus Mumford 




 Brian May, the only famous musician I know to have a PhD in astrophysics. Stud in my book.
 




 Townsend/Moon destroying instruments frequently, Townsend hitting Sinclair at Woodstock in '69? Sure Roger was the frontman, but I think it's unfair to say he overshadowed those fellows. 




 'Giorgio by Moroder' by Daft Punk on the Random Access Memories is a really cool and unique track that has Giorgio talking for a portion of the song. 




 Ehhhh I don't agree with The Who, Pete Townsend and Keith Moon also managed to make sure they weren't out of the spotlight. 




 Yeah Pete Townsend took them to a whole new level. As for another contributor, I think Neil Peart, the drummer from Rush is up there. He is a really smart dude that also writes the lyrics, lots of good lyricism in Rush songs. Not to mention, he's one of the best drummers out there.

I think it's also fair to mention John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Once he joined RHCP, he changed the game for them. Him and Jimi Hendrix are two guitarists that I really think are 'one' with their guitar/sound. So good to listen to. 




 The Who, Keith Moon helped turn drummers from time keepers into bad asses that can express themselves on the drums. Pete Townsends lyricism and brute force when playing influenced punk and expressed anger. Roger Daltrys presence on stage was also awesome. 




 Somebody To Love, Live in Montreal... To any nonbelievers

EDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpEUXRz08t4 




 It seems like encores have become a pleasantry to the bands from the fans. If the fans don't call for an encore then they might be seen as rude or ungrateful. It's the same thing as saying "bless you" when someone sneezes. It serves no purpose, but if you don't say bless you, then you look like a dick. Unless someone sneezed before, then I might cheer for a sneeze encore, depending on the quality of the sneeze. 




 Words I Never Said by Lupe Fiasco from Laser. Sky Full Of Stars by Coldplay from Ghost Stories. These are pretty mainstream, but what resonated with me the most. These songs in my opinion are a shining light in a lackluster album. Personally, I don't hate Lasers like most hip-hop fans did but I thought Lupe killed that track even if the beat was a bit industrial-esque. As for Ghost Stories, the best track is an Avicii song with Chris Martin as the featured singer. Everything else about the album is mehhhh. Gwenyth Paltrow sucks. 




 I know the leaders of TPB got caught, but as for the site as a whole, is it still safe to use? 




 This album is so chilling, watching any live performance of this album gives me goosebumps. 




 It's not like riot is cutting them royalty checks, it's more or less a pat on the back. 




 Southsiders by Atmosphere, Copper Gone by Sage Francis, and Lazaretto Jack White 




 The Pokemon? 




 I like the idea of riot developing the community's idea, but they should also give credit where credits due. Maybe just a footnote on the bottom of the page that says "Originally designed by:_____". Doesn't have to be anything too flamboyant, and maybe give that user the champ for free and some RP, seems like good enough compensation for their contribution. 




 With the emergence of youtube and talent search shows, A LOT of people have the capability to be really good at singing. The person with the best image then emerges on top 




 I feel like writing your own songs is such a big part of the artistry of music 




 I suppose you're right, maybe I need to take a chill pill on it 




 I'm not saying their not talented because they can sing really really good. I just don't think they should be idolized based on the lyrics they sing. And people quoting their lyrics as mantras for their daily lives seems like a sham. 




 I get the feeling that with modern autotuning equipment, that radio artists are a dime a dozen. Find someone with a pretty face that can sing, and we'll do the rest for ya. I lot more people are able to sing than are able to write songs. 




 I don't know about full score, but Promentory from Last Of The Mohicans is such a slept on song 




 Personally, I really don't like the idea of a band not writing their own material. It's okay in my opinion for some of their material, but people that gain fame without writing their own material isn't really that impressive to me. When someone releases a song under their name, they are effectively advocating whatever they're saying, unless its satire. So it seems like when people admire an artist/band, they're worshiping a facade. How do you guys feel about this? 




 I can't listen to them any more after finding out their lead singer is in prison for 35 years for sexually assaulting an infant. 




 This is actually pretty off base. First off Motrhead and will.i.am aren't representatives of their genre. And there's also a clear difference in time frame and it's correlation with popularity. Motrhead isn't as likely to get recognized on the scale Will is. His popularity is a lot larger so he's getting haggled everywhere he goes. Motrhead is in the twilight of their career and loves the intimacy they can have with their fans at this time in their careers. Also, if you're in Hong Kong having visa issues, how badly would you care about having your photo taken with a stranger. Must've been frustrating, as is. 




 I BELIEVE IN LOVE, THATS ALL WE'VE GOT, LOVE KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES, NO BORDERS TO CROSS! 




 First person shooter? Yeah you're gonna get kids screaming profanities regardless of nationality. 




 And yet Finland has some of the highest test scores amongst the 15-18 year old range. Get more aggressive America. Little ironic.

 




 This is just speculation and I don't have any hard evidence to back it up. But I did see that record sales are down since last year, and I don't know if it's a trend or not. However, with iTunes and such, it's a lot easier to cherry pick the songs you like and not need to buy the others. Could it be easier for the less active fans to quickly sift through a bands *newest* and *best* tunes without having to listen through them all. Basically, is a band better off hyping 3-4 singles for a bunch of sales than an entire album? 




 I'm not afraid to admit that I love power ballads, I'm not even afraid to admit it on reddit where I'm sure they're scorned. That being said, who's brave enough to admit some of their favorite power ballads?
