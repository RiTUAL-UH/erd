 Glad you are enjoying it everyone!  I ride again tomorrow night (Saturday) at the very end of the evening session.  I'm number 422, see if you can spot me! 




 Too cute!  And what a great mare -- you two can do anything together! 




 You can watch the show as much as you like for free!  They have live feeds from all three show rings (which work simultaneously), but most of the action goes on in the Coliseum.  I'll be showing my horse tonight in the Hunter Pleasure Amateur World Championship.  Evening session begins tonight at 7pm central time.  Have fun watching! 









 Go Morgans!  Proud to see my breed do so well! 




 They are an incredibly beautiful family!  Men so sexy, kids so cute!!!!

 AWWWW!!!!!  What breed?  You guys are the cutest! 




 I had a baby squirrel once as well, and then he was rehabbed and released into the wild.  His name was Earl. :) 




 The day I met him, I deleted my account.  True story. 




 My experience on OkCupid ended with me finding my boyfriend.  Coming up on 2 years together this winter.  We are a happy family (family = the two of us and the dog)! 




 He actually has TWO thermals, because last Halloween I *almost* got him to go as Dexter.  He looks incredibly sexy in them.  I wish I had pictures of THAT to share with you! 




 Here you go:  http://i.imgur.com/qdnoF.jpg (with our dog Apollo) and also http://i.imgur.com/JMLF4.jpg.  Perhaps not the best pictures of him, but the ones that are the most "Dexter-y".  :)  See what you think.  He claims there is no resemblance! 




 My boyfriend looks like Dexter, but he won't believe me.  Either way, they are both hella sexy.   














 I hope it is delicious!  On a side note, you have the best username ever. 




 I've learned to love mine my naming all of them.  The best one is Weeb, and his dog Ghosty. 




 I thought it was normal too until about 10 years ago when my friends gently explained that I was a freak. 




 Oh man, his beard looks nuzzleable. 




 Tall, sexy, great voice, glasses...what more could a woman want? 




 So hot.  So hilarious.  Dibs. 




 YES!  This is the secret game I play on the bus each morning on the way to class. 




 I want to rip all seven of those shirts off of him!

 AH YES!  I have the biggest ladyboner for him.  And this picture is my favorite.  It's gotten to the point that just seeing radishes like these gives me a ladyboner!  And when he wears a plaid shirt and rolls up the sleeves, and you get to see those forearms...*swoon*

I've met him a couple times, and not only is he a total hottie, he is also a humble sweetheart.  A very nice guy!   




 Holy ladyboner!!!   




 He has such a great beard.  Good beard is key. 




 Major swoon, and such magnificent forearms!!! 




 I call second dibs. 




 That would be awesome!  They need little BSG uniforms. 




 Oh this happens all the time!  The Crazy Color Breeders as I call them.  I had to ride some National Show Horses back in the day that were all bred to be pinto, and most of them looked like they had been put together by a committee, and few of them had a brain.

There are, of course, some really excellent uniquely colored horses out there!  I just like a good horse, no matter what color it happens to be. 




 BAHAHAHA!  Man, I want a ninja to defend my uterus.  




 I think he's sharing something painful that is happening to him, and is also proud of his grandfather for the fight he put up.

I'm going to stop replying to you now, and you'll probably see it as a victory for yourself, but really it's me having better things to do than argue with you. 




 I don't think that is what the OP is doing here.   




 I don't like you. 




 It's nice, he's a culturally aware sociopath.   









 Ahhh so this happens after the egg has already cooked.  I must try this!
 




 I, too, live in Minnesota.  Just wait until winter.  Then the bitching will commence. 




 I must understand how this works.  Putting the chopstick there to create the shape I understand, but the shell is still on.  How does it get though the egg's mighty armor? 




 That.  Is.  Terrifying. 




 Well the horse isn't fat, she's pregnant.  She'll be fine. :) 




 I love that it's wearing an oven mitt. 




 I had the ever-dreaded sunburn from snow, and I was wearing sunglasses with an earflap hat.  I *wish* I had pictures. 




 Whatever he is, he's sexy. 




 Upvote for ponies. 




 THIS!  I look at my boyfriend's can of abpa all the time and think, "what the hell is abpa?" 




 I'm a big fan of Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds.  Added bonus: their catalogs are beautiful!  




 Adorable!  For some reason I think she looks like the dog Martha from the TV show "Martha Speaks".  I think it's the expression. 




 I too own an Apollo, but his full name is Mr. Apollo Happypants Creed. 




 upvote for ears 




 Also with a name engineered for cuteness! 




 I've always liked the name Finn for a dog.  He looks like a Finn. 




 Starbuck!  She is super cute!  Mine is Apollo, also after BSG!  (http://i.imgur.com/8OuAw.jpg) 




 Ah yes, my dog is all about the bathtub.  He will also hop into the shower with you to get water if you don't close the bathroom door.
