 admission is the first step, we'll get thru this together 




 see, at least you can admit when you're wrong 




 http://mediamatters.org/research/2015/06/03/17-school-districts-debunk-right-wing-lies-abou/203867

will you look at that 




 nope 




 dont be so hard on yourself, you're only human, you make mistakes 




 there's always Minnesota... 




 at least we've shown that you dont always need religion to be transphobic 




 dont hurt yourself. i know it's hard to acknowledge the fact that you've been transphobic, but we can get thru this. 




 i know, it's ok, maybe you'll see the light and stop being transphobic in the light of medical science. until then, i can only hope you dont embarrass yourself further by arguing against gravity. 




 whoops, missed that. sorry, got all excited 




 nice when science shuts someone up.

thanks for playing, please try again later. 




 true dat 




 http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm

say what now? 




 they'd actually see me as female. so if looks are your criteria, plenty of trans women would meet that. but why discriminate based on something so cosmetic? put a dor in front of the shower and wekre good to go. 




 if it walks like a duck, and talks like a duck.... 




 hell, it's pakistan, for a woman just speaking up is probably a radical act 




 oh yeah, you made it pretty clear you were transphobic. 




 by mary cheney no less 




 misgendering again. doesnt take much to treat another person with empathy and respect, which you dont seem to want to do.  




 misgendering again. i didnt do anything except show your own transphobia. you may not want to admit it. but it's true. the simple act of misgendering someone means you dont give a single shit about the person. we're people, all we want to do is go into the restroom of of gender, do our business and get the hell out of there. most trans people dont want to spend any more time in there than we can help because of people like you.  and we'll keep on doing it, because most of the time, peopl elike you wont even have a clue.

thanks for playing. maybe one day the world will have fewer transphobic people like you. until then, i wont advertise the fact that i'm trans and keep on using the dang women's restroom BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN.

pretty simple. 




 just being true to myself, as are all other trans people. and you know what. you'll never know. the dude bro washing his hands next to you might actually have a vajayjay. 

have a good one. i'll be in the women's restroom

thanks for playing. 




 thank goodness it doesnt matter what you think, i'm a girl, no matter if i have a penis, and i'm going to CONTINUE to use the girls restroom because that's what i identify as.  jees, it aint that hard.

and putting laws that restrict MY access to it because you're worried about somebody else exploiting it is ridonkulous. 




  I AM saying you have no business making everyone else uncomfortable because you don't want to use the bathroom that you are built for.

ok, right there, that's textbook transphobia. the bathroom i was built for? please, i've used both boys and girls bathrooms, nobody has given a shit, wanna know why? cuz people use the bathrooms because they have to go. nothing more, nothing less.


 I AM saying that if this becomes the norm, it is easily exploitable, and that's a very dangerous thing.

again, unless you can show me a case where a trans person has assaulted another person in a bathroom, you're a solution in search of a problem. 




 i agree 100% 




 nope 




 if you really want to go thru my history, you'll realize that it's MY copypasta. i keep it handy for responses to posts like yours. i'm trans myself, i've DONE my research. i can respond to pretty much any question you have, AND back myself up with links and quotes to a ton of articles i've previously read and researched.

any time you want to have an intellectual conversation, go right ahead. 




 josh was also a minor at the time. look, i'm not defending the piece of shit, he took advantage of those who couldnt defend themselves. but he wasnt a pedophile by legal definition. NOR was he a "confused" child like his parents and pastor suggest.

but calling him a pedophile takes away from the actual issues 




  If I were to answer your question, yes. That's always been a yes.

then you have your answer. because absent everything else, you choose to press that button. which means you DO want to transition.

**National Commission on Correctional Health Care**


Position Statement: Transgender Health Care in Correctional Settings (2009) 

The health risks of overlooking the particular needs of transgender inmates are so severe that acknowledgment of the problem and policies that assure appropriate and responsible provision of health care are needed.  
Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the
biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis.

 you're coming at it wrong. let's do the button test, shall we?

assuming everything else stays the same, if you could push that button and wake up tomorrow as a girl and NOBODY would be the wiser. would you push it?

therein lies your answer, because if your heart answered yes even if your head was trying to find a reason to say no, then you know what's right for you. a lot of us fight it. hell, i fought it for 30+ years, i only came out at 39. 

make the appointment with a gender therapist 




 nobody said that religion was logical 




 something something freedom of speech 




 technically, josh was under aged, so he's "just" a sexual abuser 




 hey, tell the huckster not to claim to be god's messenger and we'll be good. 




 i see, so rather than let the trans people use the bathrooms they need to, you'd rather ban them from doing so, in order to stop fundies taking advantage of it.  yeah. how bout no. how bout we let the trans people use the bathrooms they want to use and then go after the ones who are pretending to be trans. pretty easy to do. 




 do you honestly think for a second, that a trans person, IN HIGH SCHOOL, would get naked in front of their school mates? hell, i know i wouldnt. 




 i see, and how many incidents do you think that a trans person has assaulted somebody in a restroom? you can google it, but i'll save you the trouble. zero. nada. zip. 

besides, trans people have been using the restrooms of their gender for ages. it's the fundies that are trying to stir up fear against "a dude in a dress" going in and raping women.

trans women, and it almost always involves trans women, have been assaulted and killed for nothing more than trying to live their lives in the gender that are. 




 that's what my girlfriends say ALL the time, i have to turn them down tho, cuz i'm asexual 




 i post news articles all over the place, i like to read the convos that start. like i sad, aspel, different strokes, different folks 




 and i prefer a free-for-all. different strokes, different folks 




 i just saw that over on /r/politics. that was an awesome read. 




 http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2015/06/02/3665262/huckabee-transgender-shower-feminine/ 




 a girl can dream 




 or just go with gender neutral restrooms. 




 While both serious issues, they are very different. 

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is an anxiety disorder that causes sufferers to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and to have a distorted view of how they look.

Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity...This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. It is not a mental illness.

both those definitions are from Britain's National Health Service. With the changes in the new Diagnostic Standards Manual (version V), there has been the removal of disorder in the title of the entry concerning gender identity (which in previous versions was labeled gender identity disorder). Although there are still hold outs, the vast majority of medical professionals and mental healthcare providers agree: if a person with gender dysphoria is having issues with mental illness, which is not uncommon, gender dysphoria is not the underlying cause. Rather, it is society's unwillingness to treat individuals with gender dysphoria with care, dignity, and respect (including necessary medical treatment, when appropriate) which can lead to maladjustment. A great many individuals with gender dysphoria are considered perfectly well-adjusted, the stressors of gender dysphoria being comparable to other stressors associated with any serious medical condition. 




 it's a perfectly normal response, when everybody just assumes jenner's transition is how we all do it, where you just go away for awhile and come back and you're FABULOUS. but think of it this way, she started transitioning in the 80's. and then stopped when she got married to Kris. so she's been stuck in that awkward inbetweeny stage for THIRTY years. and they have said some AWFUL things about her appearance in that time. So she's had a LOT of abuse heaped on her, more so because she's a celebrity.

i know how exhausting it can get with people wanting to talk about you being trans when all you want to do is get on with your life. i try to do trans 101 as often as i can, but i do have those days where i will just go stealth and just get on with my day.

the media storm will pass, but hopefully, people will have gained a more positive outlook and a little understanding about what it is to be trans. 




 they're rare, but they do exist

 biologists would beg to differ

http://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943 




 body dysmorphia is different from gender dysphoria. 




 welllllllllll, that's not quite true, i'm a trans female and i am VERY attracted to girls. and i know plenty of other trans people, both girls and guys who are gay. 




 oh, i thought you wanted to argue medical definitions, legal? jenner had her documentation changed, so legally, she's a woman. glad you simplified it.

thanks for playing. 




 lol ;-) 




 thankfully, medical science disagrees with you 




 no using the "r" word please 




 My friend from D.C. told me that  it's BLM combined with BSEE/BOMRE ... and the problem is, those bureaus are essentially self-sustaining (much like the Forest Service) by leasing these public lands. 




 which proves my point, your organs and your genitalia do not make up who you are as a person. a woman is a woman, even if she lacks a womb, or ovaries, or happens to have been assigned male at birth 




 but no womb. our organs and our genitals do not make us who we are. we think, therefore we are. it's a very deep philosophical discussion, actually  




 http://www.newsweek.com/first-successful-birth-womb-transplant-sweden-275376

say what now? 




 http://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943

no, we're not 




 i was 7 when i saw a documentary about trans women. the light went on and i knew i was one of them. i'm 42 now. guess what, it WASNT a phase 




  2015 ICD-10-CM Z72.51 High risk heterosexual behavior

just because there's a code for it, doesnt mean it applies to everybody. 




 we are not defined by our genitals 




 exactly, and the admins ban by IP, so no alts. perma ban ban. bye bye birdie 




 see, i usually keep it going because they eventually break down and let lose with a lot of swearing and threats. and then i report it to the admins and get all of their accounts banned 




 yes it is

 




 yes it is 




 and miss out on all the fun? ;-) 




 yes it is. 




 yes it is. 




 it is bigoted to go against a trans person's gender. which you have, which makes you a bigot. see? wasnt that easy. 




 yes, you've said that, and you agree with bryan fischer, you are both bigots. we've established this already. 




 ah but i am a seeker of knowledge. i will happily believe in a god as soon as i have proof. show me a sign of your god's existence! i have been trying to summon a god the wrong way all this time. please show me how 




 about a third of all trans people would disagree with you. assuming 700k trans peoplein the US, that makes about 230k-ish. it happens way more often than you think. i'm trans, i'm also a lesbian, so are a whole bhunch of my trans friends both guy and girl. 




 nah, having way more fun showing you how wrong and bigoted you are. medical science says trans people exist. and unqualified person like you is saying we dont. lemme seeeeee...... i'll go with medical science! 




 you're not rendering an opinion, you're intentionally misgendering a trans person. and that is the very definition of transphobia.  




 you're welcome! 




 http://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943

not just about the chromosomes  




 actually, no, because there isnt any medical science backing up your claim. try again. 




 I SUMMON YOU GOD TO APPEAR BEFORE ME.

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand nothing happens.

therefore, i posit that there is no god. should i have gone wrong somewhere in my methodology, please advise on what i have to change in order to summon a god. 




 actually, that kinda is, when you reduce a person to their genitals. 




 well, several medical associations would beg to differ with you

Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals
(2012)  
 Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.  

**The American Psychiatric Association:**  
1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.  
2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.  
3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.  
4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons.

American Psychological Association
Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression Non-Discrimination (2008)
As stated in the Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression NonDiscrimination,
the APA opposes all public and private discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity and expression and urges the repeal of discriminatory laws and policies and calls upon psychologists in their professional roles to provide appropriate, nondiscriminatory treatment to transgender and gender variant individuals and encourages psychologists to take a leadership role in working against discrimination towards transgender and gender variant individuals. 

The APA recognizes the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public and private insurers to cover these medically necessary treatments.

**American Academy of Family Physicians**  
Resolution No. 1004 (2012)
In 2007, an AAFP Commission declared that the association has a policy opposing any
form of patient discrimination and stated its opposition to the exclusion of transgender
health care. In 2012, the organization released a new resolution: RESOLVED, That the
American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) support efforts to require insurers to
provide coverage for comprehensive care of [transgender] individuals including medical
care, screening tests based on medical need rather than gender, mental health care, and,
when medically necessary, gender reassignment surgery.

**American Academy of Physician Assistants**  
Non-Discrimination Statement  (Adopted 2000; amended 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008)
Physician assistants should not discriminate against classes or categories of patients in the delivery of needed health care. Such classes and categories includegender identity.

**American College of Nurse Midwives**  
Transgender/Transsexual/Gender Variant Health Care (2012)
The American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) supports efforts to provide transgender, transsexual, and gender variant individuals with access to safe, comprehensive, culturally competent health care and therefore endorses the 2011 World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care

Please see Ethical Conduct for the Physician Assistant Profession (Adopted 2000, amended 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008) and Comprehensive Health Care Reform (Adopted 2005 and amended 2010). 

**National Association of Social Workers**  
Transgender and Gender Identity Issues Policy Statement (2008)
 NASW supports the rights of all individuals to receive health insurance and other health coverage without discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and specifically without exclusion of services related to transgender or transsexual transitionin order to receive medical and mental health services through their primary care physician and the appropriate referrals to medical specialists, which may include hormone replacement therapy, surgical interventions, prosthetic devices, and other medical procedures.

**World Professional Association for Transgender Health**  
Clarification on Medical Necessity of Treatment, Sex Reassignment, and Insurance Coverage in the U.S.A. (2008)  
WPATH found that decades of experience with the Standards of Care show gender transitions and related care to be accepted, good medical practice and effective treatment.  
In a 2008 clarification, WPATH stated:

[S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures...


The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not cosmetic or elective or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition.

**National Commission on Correctional Health Care**


Position Statement: Transgender Health Care in Correctional Settings (2009) 

The health risks of overlooking the particular needs of transgender inmates are so severe that acknowledgment of the problem and policies that assure appropriate and responsible provision of health care are needed.  
Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the
biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis.

 like i said, belittling and invalidating trans people. but you go on right ahead making fun of people who have gender dysphoria. and i see you dont think trans men exist.  




  I find it funny that you are mocking Fox News for mocking a man pretending to be a woman.

that you like belittling and invalidating trans people. 




 you would ;-) 




 no, but i can express how much i detest your opinion 




 and in return we get to tell you how much we disagree with you.
gotta love that whole freedom of speech. you're free to share your opinion, but so am i. 




 stereotyping by referring to all the times they have actually BEEN the biggest asshats on the planet? i think that's just stating facts. 




 or, you know, just refer to the DSM V, you know the big book of medical answers that the doctors refer to in order to come to a diagnosis.

In the upcoming fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5),
people whose gender at birth is contrary to the one they identify with will be diagnosed with gender
dysphoria. This diagnosis is a revision of DSM-IVs criteria for gender identity disorder and is intended
to better characterize the experiences of affected children, adolescents, and adults.

 sex and gender are two different things. sex is who you go to bed with, gender is who you go to bed as. 




 hey, if Prince can do it.... 




 she, you gotta use female pronouns now 




 lots of us love her. she done a whole lot to change people's attitudes in a VERY short amount of time. 




 the artist formerly known as bruce jenner 




 i would like if the whole world had this attitude to trans people. it would make my life a whole lot better, as opposed to constantly being asked what parts i happen to have under my dress. 




 the process is different from state to state. some states allow for change of name and gender by court order, some by doctor's letter. some states will allow you to change the gender on your birth certificate, some dont, some allow you to change it only if you have had reassignment surgery.

i live in california, so my name and gender change was pretty easy, i made an appointment at the court, went before the judge and got a court ordered name and gender change. i then went to the dmv and the social security office and gave them the court order and they changed my name and gender. 

same with the bank. and all the other agencies i had to deal with, power company, phone, internet, insurance, etc.

 please be civil and respectful 




 please keep it civil 




 i'm just concerned that the baby transies will go in there, hear someone say "hey take this dose" and think that it's a one-size-fits-all kinda deal. you know how impatient some of us are to start. 

i just want to make sure that they know what the risks are of self-medding AND give them all the info they need if they choose to do it anyway.  




 spoken like someone with no clue about what it means to be transgender. 




 like i said, it's totally condescending to women, and it prioritizes the man's needs above that of the woman's. the whole tone is demeaning and dismissive of women. 




 now who's taking stuff out of context. 




 i know why the admins did it, it's obviously to cover their ass. but people actually DO go to /r/asktransgender for medical advice. and i just want to be sure that people know that we arent doctors and that even if we were, we still couldnt advise them without examining them in the first place. 

we all know people who self-med, either because they couldnt spend one more day as the gender they werent, or because they had no access to meds. 

at the same time, there's no one standard dose because everybody's body is different.

i think if people know the entire range of dosages available as well as what a typical person's hormone range is, then they'll have enough info to make a decision.

 




 the whole article is condescending to women, as if only the man's needs are paramount. it's all about how to get her in the mood so she consents. if she  says no, then it means no. 




 hey, sorry for piggygreenfingers' comments. lots of us struggle with weight. but my take on it is that you should think of your health first. i know lots of girls (and guys) who have lost lots of weight after coming out. amazing what not constantly thinking about your gender will do for your happiness. we all have the fear of not passing. i had it for the first year before i relaxed enough to see that if everybody else around me was gendering me female, then i should too.

 good point 




 yeesh, sorry for letting it get that far. i was getting a little hot under the collar. my mom always said to stay away from religion and politics. 




 right, right, so Hitler wasnt a "real" Christian. how very convenient. listen, if it walks like a christian, and talks like a christian, then for all intent and purposes, HE'S A CHRISTIAN. look at all the "bad" popes thru history. some of them had multiple concubines for crying out loud, THEY FATHERED CHILDREN. so that makes them any less "christian" because they did something bad? no. same applies to hitler. all those priests that molested children, are they any less "christian" 

but you keep right on believing that there's a difference.

 




 ah, so you also read

Hitler was not excommunicated[5] prior to his suicide. The biographer John Toland noted Hitler's anticlericalism but considered him still in "good standing" with the Church by 1941 




 then did you not read in the same wiki

In Mein Kampf, Hitler makes a number of religious allusions, claiming to be "acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator" and to have been chosen by providence.[14][20] In a 1922 speech he said,"My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter [...] who [...] recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them..."[21] In a 1928 speech, he said: "We tolerate no one in our ranks who attacks the ideas of Christianity ... in fact our movement is Christian." 




 hitler was christian 




 they lost their collective marbles over constantine 




 not on tv 




 pssst, there is no god. 




 holy shitballs, people talk about it all the time, but going thru it is an experience unto itself. wow. blew my fucking mind. 




 whoooooo boy, do you ever feel. before i started on estrogen, it was like i was watching a black and white tv with the volume turned all the way down. once i started, it was like technicolor went wild and i was living in willy wonka land with neon colored flashing light and the music cranked up to 11. i remember having to pull over to the side of the freeway just to have a good cry for no apparent reason. i gradually became used to it, and i exist in a happy medium right now, but i feel way more emotion than i did before. thank god.

but again, everybody's body is different, so ymmv 




 here, try this

 this should help

 because i look NOTHING like a male anymore

http://imgur.com/a/l65Jh 




 *sigh*

did i also mention that i was trans? flying back with a male passport will be kinda sucky. blech. 




 now you just made me hungry 




 singaporean here too, i left a long long time ago. maybe one day i'll go back, but it'll be for the food and nothing else. mmmmmmmm. god i miss the food. 




 psssst.....

there is no god 




 it's always a god for you. cant you see that it's a better world when you realize that there is no god? that you have but one life to live.
 you could have easily ended the convo hours ago, by simply pointing out proof, ANY proof that your god exists. you havent, so we go on dancing. i'm quite enjoying this. i can to tell you that there is no god, and there's nothing you can do about it, because you know i'm right. 

amazing isnt it? one simple statement of fact as opposed to reams and reams of oratory as priests and pastors struggle to try and convince the flock every weekend that there is a god when half of them dont believe it themselves.

so, in conclusion, i submit, yet again, that there is no god. 




 you're welcome, any time i can help a struggling theist be comfortable with the fact that there is no god, i consider a successful day.

here are some resources if you need.

http://atheists.org/activism/resources 




 then i'd suggest the LA Children's Hospital. they have the biggest and best trans child unit in the country 

http://www.chla.org/site/c.ipINKTOAJsG/b.7501767/#.VWwD7s9Viko


call this guy 

Luis Moreno  
323-361-5372  
lumoreno@chla.usc.edu

if you dont get a hold of him by phone, email him, he'll go over all the requirements with you. they have a therapist you can talk to, and dr olsen is great. they have a tiny group meeting every wednesday during the day if you can make it. 




 yeah, the one thing that surprised me was how much it affected some people. one of my really good, really old friends pretty much had the same reaction as your friend did. 

you have to give them a moment to have a moment. they go thru the same stages of grief as you would losing somebody. it's silly, but that's what happens.

you've had years to think this over, it's ALL new to them, and it can be a little overwhelming. i cant tell you how surprised i was when a few of my friends needed MY support in dealing with it.

cracked me up to no end.

so just give your friend a little time. just talk thru their fears, try and make them see that they're not losing you at all. it'll still be you, just in a body that you're more comfortable in. 




 well, call the la lgbt center, they have a great trans program and they're very knowledgeable. are you under 25? do you have insurance? a yes to both those questions means you could go thru the LA Children's hospital. they're great too. also, there's a group that meets every friday at the la lgbt center, be good for you if you want to hang around a bunch of trans people.  




 yup, i sure do. doesnt stop me from liking other girls too. that one is just the one at the top. 




 who said anything about denying people? my last girlfriend was asian, the girlfriend before that was dark haired russian. my current girlfriends are white, but both of them are brunette. all i said was that i prefer blonds. again, merely stating a preference. 




 we are both atheists, i merely believe in one less god than you. come, just let go of one more god. it'll be ok, there are other who live their life by logic and science. 

just repeat after me


there is no god 




 please be respectful, and civil. 




 nah, why waste time 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moSFlvxnbgk

come be one with the unbelievers, we can help you. all you need to do is let it go. 




 lmao, this deep into the thread, and all you had to do to end it was to show me proof of god. you havent. isnt it time you stopped believing in a faerie tale? come out as an unbeliever, we have great cookies. you cannot prove your god exists. it would be the easiest way to convert people. show us he exists. and we'll follow. light all the candles, sing all the hymn. 

god doesnt exist. never has. never will.

amen. 




 no, only dating white girls because you believe that the white race is superior and all other races should bow before you and kiss the ground you walk on is racist. me? i just have a preference for blonds.  




 feel free 




 it's ok to let go of the idea of god. i know it's scary, it always is to let go of something that you've thought was solid bedrock, only to see, once the wool has been taken away from your eyes, to be nothing more than shifting sand.

it's ok. 

it'll be ok.

let go of your god and let him drift away on the wind that created him in teh first place.

come be with the free folk, those of us who live life fully engaged in the world, where we live for THIS life, because we know that this is the only life we get. 




 prove god exists, otherwise, no god exists. pretty simple, eh? 




 well, i did it the way i knew how, but obviously i must have done something wrong. could you please point out where i went wrong? perhaps a summoning spell is in order? this is the only way i know how to prove that a god does not exist. 

 




 you're welcome 




 ah, so you can prove that a god exists, good, now we're getting somewhere. how does one prove the existence of god. 




 you called it "fake genitalia", it's not

you said that post-op vaginas are incapable of self-lubrication, they are

you said we shouldnt expect to be able to fully orgasm, that's incorrect

so pretty much your entire post. 




 well, let's review shall we? you've asked me to prove that there is no god, which i have. but you seem to disagree with my methods of summoning a god. so i have repeatedly asked you what the proper way of summoning a god is, which you have not provided. failing that, i've asked you how you can prove that there is a god, but i'm still waiting for that proof. 

again, should you provided me a single shred of evidence that a god exists, i will happily change my mind. isnt that what you are called to do in your faith? well, i'm asking. please prove that your god exists, and i will add my name to the roster of true believers.

CAN I GET AN AMEN??? 




 Please be respectful  




 again, my apologies if i did something wrong, i am more than happy to correct my ways. if you can show me how to summon a god, i will be happy to do so.

you asked me to prove that there is no god, and i showed you the way i test it. if you have a test that shows otherwise, i'll be happy to change my mind. 




 easy, if god is with me, i summon them into a form of a storm cloud in the shape of a unicorn with three legs.

nope. nothing happened.

so, therefore, god does not exist.

again, if i'm doing something wrong in summoning him, i'd be open to suggestions on the correct way of summoning a god. 




 you mean this kind of "treatment"?

http://www.people.com/article/inside-josh-duggar-treatment-
 




 you're entitled to your opinion, but it just seemed like you were really down on cis people. 




 look, some people have a type, i, for example, like blondes, and white girls. it's a preference. not all chasers are bad. i'm VERY attracted to trans girls. altho the invites i've received thru OKCupid are a thing of beauty to behold. lots of them are pretty much "does your dick still work? cuz if yes, that's hot, wanna fuck?" 




 well that i agree with, but you've had a pretty negative tone when you've commented about cis people.  




 please be respectful 




 so get yourself a nice trans girl who likes to use hers. problem solved! 




 well yeah, it is kinda out of the ordinary to tell people that you're trans. we're such a small minority of the population. i've had non-stop convos with people at parties when i tell them. it's a great icebreaker. i can just keep going thru the whole party. met some really great people that way. 




 lol, get used to not getting your way. just because we will not tolerate your intolerance. go spread the hate somewhere else. the rest of us will happily get along without religion. 




 http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/americans-overwhelmingly-support-executive-action-to-ban-anti-lgbt-workplac

i respectfully disagree with your assessment. i dont know what it was in your past that has turned you so against cis people, but i count a great many cis people as my friends, and they have been nothing but supportive.  and, according to the poll, so are most americans. 




 yeah, you kinda left out the conversion therapy places, the jesus camps. the pastors, the christian leaders. 




 there will always be people who have been hurt, badly, and will always see the negative. we can only respond with positives and try to bring them around. 




 even our own allies have been known to be transphobic. stephen colbert as well, conan o'brien. conan used the t-slur and when people complained, he apologized immediately saying that he didnt know it was a slur and that it would never be used on the show again. it made me so happy to hear. 

so yes, i will always give people the benefit of the doubt. 




 most of the cis people i've told have been confused, but positive in their reactions. i've had one or two bible thumpers tell me i'm going to hell, but i just chalk it up to religious brainwashing.  




 dont confuse a lack of understanding with transphobia, i know it may be frustrating to have to do trans 101 over and over again, but even with all the trans coverage in the media, there are still some people who dont get it.

i DO agree with you about some people being transphobic. i've got some internalized transphobia myself with recent MtF transitioners. i catch myself ALL the time. it's not something that i'm proud of, but i try to push thru it. 




 they werent hiding behind religion, now were they? the great atrocities were done in the name of religion   




  And it was. 

no it wasnt. the proper treatment would have been to report it to the authorities and have him immediately taken away for treatment. AWAY from the other girls so that he couldnt assault others. THAT is the proper treatment. 




 it's all good, i know some things really get us going. 




 dont diss the cis. we cant win this war without our cis allies. while it is true that cis people have a hard time understanding what it means to be trans, not all of them are actively working against us. 




 hey, i know things can get heated sometimes, but please refrain from personal attacks, i'm going to tell /u/evendeathmaydie the same thing 




 easy as pie

I SUMMON YOU GOD

nothing happened

there, i just proved that god does not exist. 




  How many "underage" girls did YOU try to "molest" when you were 14-17 years old?

for me and millions of other kids, none. what josh duggar did was a sexual assault. and instead of getting caught and sent for treatment, his parents did nothing. for the girls who were assaulted, NOTHING was done. and for you to try and defend such a sexual assault as a normal course of puberty is absolutely disgusting.  




 the jews sent to the camps were poles, hungarians, germans, italians, french, austrian, ukranian, etc. it was an attempt to exterminate an entire religion.
