 Two very different characters. 




 As the title states, I believe someone should make a subreddit where users who have been killed by hackers on a server can go make a Text Post and request for a person to come and try and kill the hacker. 




 Kind of makes farming seem pointless. 




 I remember my least favourite encounter with a hacker in DayZ, I was running along, SKS on my back, suddenly, in the corner I see "I have emptied my SKS" then my character opens a pipsi and drinks it, just a as a really cool bandit looking character appeared and headshotted me with his fully customized M4. *I hate hackers* 




 Just join another server if you see this. 




 I don't believe this is your first adventure. 




 You may give away your position if you like hiding, because apparently eating human meat is funny.

 Nope. They don't say what GPU it has. 




 This is so true, when admin Logs come out admins will check who killed them, then ban their killer. 




 Probably just a duper wanting to get his friends some AK's. 




 *Well fuck physics* 




 Instead of dragging it when you can see it on the left, double click it and it moves it to the first available slot that the item can fit into. 




 I am about 99% Admin Logs aren't out yet. 




 Do I replace the X's in the code? 




 Same here, except DayZ has more towns, so it is a little different. 




 Also while along the coast you can use train tracks. 




 Did you also get cancer from that? 




 Oh jesus, you obviously don't have the upperhand in a gunfight. 




 Which part? *All of it*
