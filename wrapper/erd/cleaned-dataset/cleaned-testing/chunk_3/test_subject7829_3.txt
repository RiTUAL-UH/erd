 ... or not so simple, if that's available. But I would be fine with simple (10-year-old Java level) right now. 









 It also doesn't take into account the issue of land-values, on which productivity has no effect.

Productivity does affect land value. For example, after the invention of the elevator and modern building techniques, the value of land in or near a city increased dramatically due to the fact you can fit more people and/or make more products with the same amount of land than you could previously.

Likewise, the Internet and telepresence technology has affected land value, but in the opposite direction (reducing demand) 




 Did I mention that in the Spanish reddit (meneame) 90% of the comments are from people that seemingly would support a Leninist state?

Haha, if they actually get a Leninist state, they can kiss all that welfare goodbye:

"The first principle of Socialism is: He who does not work, does not eat."

 Thoughts thinking "I am" is man

when labels cause actions are they just labels, or have they become something more?

what sees that there is nothing to be defended? does nothing see itself? If so, has it remained nothing, or has being now appeared?

life, in just living, becomes more than itself. 














 Snow does not think "I am snow," but

man thinks "I am man," so

when this thought occurs,

what is happening?



When Life turns to see itself,

is it the controller, or the controlled?

Both or neither? Or,

is something more mysterious happening, 

a hall of mirrors that leads to awakening? 




 There might be a mint there, but only if you can get past the media screaming about "ebonics" or some such nonsense. I can just imagine Limbaugh now: "New fake IQ test racist against whites! Makes blacks seem smart when they're not!"

As other posters mentioned, this is really a non-issue: Murray's own data shows economic status was the determining variable, not race, even if we admit "race" as a coherent, measurable concept, which I and most scientists have serious doubts about anyway. Remember there was a time when Italians and Jews were not considered "white," and now they are. 




 I agree, but that's not the conclusion he drew in the book. 




 He also fails to mention the rise of the war on drugs, and the increasingly large portion of the black male population that is in jail.

He did note that he focused exclusively on whites to avoid "ethnic issues." But the fact that this guy's book is called "The State of White America" raises the creepy level in the room just a bit. If this is the same Charles Murray who wrote "The Bell Curve," which suggested that blacks "naturally" have an IQ level 15 points below whites, it all starts to fit together. He's not worried about blacks because he thinks they're beyond hope anyway. 





























 The Dry Tortugas are indeed in the Caribbean. This is a different island with a similar name. "Tortuga" is Spanish for "turtle." 



















 I would prefer to use the term "strength of effect" when referring to a linear coefficient, and I would prefer that it be used in replacement of or at least along with correlation when reporting how variables are linked. 









 Only in our Galaxy. 




 In terms of pure math, you are correct, but when the general public hears the words "strongly correlated," that's not what they think. It is possible, after all to have some form of cancer be "strongly correlated" with weight, and yet have it that a 160 lb. person has a 2.1% chance of the cancer whereas a 250 lb. person has a 2.2% chance of the cancer. In cases like these unit invariance is irrelevant - reporting such a link as "strongly correlated" is misleading, even though technically accurate. 




 No... part of what it's showing is you get the same correlation value for many different patterns. Even if you just look at linear patterns, you can get the same correlation value with radically different slopes on the best-fit line. Two quantities can have a correlation of close to 1 (which would seem to imply a strong relation) and yet still be only weakly related in reality if the slope of the best-fit line is close to 0. 
























 Eminent? 









 Makes sense. Thanks. 




 As a side note, some speculate that, because of two rivers that don't flow anymore, the Garden of Eden was located at the bottom of the Persian Gulf.

Fully accepting that this is whako, I would like some elaboration on this point nonetheless. 




 Thanks for the link. What do you mean by "abandon determinism"? 




 Plain English as much as possible, please. I can deal with *some* equations but nothing too heavy. Thanks! 









 It's not explained why it freaks me out. 




 Cartoons in general, especially old cartoons. The Macy's balloons really creep me out. 
























 I don't really think you get what I'm trying to say. Read the other posts in this thread, they explain it better than I do.

The point is, 0!=1 is not a "tack on" that has nothing to do with the rest of the definition of a factorial and is just there for convenience so we don't end up dividing by zero. It is implied by the original definition. 




 Then the same can be argued about any mathematical function. It's not a "convention" in the way that placing the dependent variable on the left-hand side of an equation is a "convention."  0!=1 is suggested by the underlying concept itself, not just inherited tradition. 




 It's a convention, not a theorem. It's been chosen like that because it's useful.

No, that is not correct, it is in the structure of the idea of the factorial. Think of a baseball team of x players. There are x! ways for the coach to order them on a bench for photo. Now imagine if the coach simply wanted a picture of the empty bench (0 players.) There is only one way to order that photo. Therefore 0!=1

A similar argument can be made for the "inevitability" of such seemingly "hacky" definitions such as a^0 = 1. 


































 The reaction uses a secret catalyst

Stopped reading right there. Just another Cold Fusion scam and-or self-delusion. 




 I don't think we need any fancy Category Theory to solve this problem as some other posters have suggested.

You merely have to distinguish between declarable and constructable entities. For example, I can *declare* "a square circle" by saying these words, but I could never actually construct one.

Similarly, in Set Theory we can say "The set of all sets," but it is not clear if we mean declarable or constructable sets. The set of all declarable sets includes some sets which trigger Russel's Paradox, and thus are not constructable.

When a mathematician is saying "all sets this, all sets that," he is most likely referring to the set of all *constructable* sets.  




 Why a vow to free beings - or even just one's own being- if there are no beings to free?

Empty of *inherent* selfhood does not mean total emptiness of being, but rather than our selves are unavoidably dependent on the existence of other beings (dependent origination.)

So this is where the vow originates to free all beings - it cannot be any other way, since all being is tied up together. 




 I wasn't going as far back as Smith - just pointing out that Libertarianism was around when any person living today was in High School. 




 True, but if you have to have a graphic metaphor, horseshoe beats grid. Libertarianism, if not the modern Party, has been around quite some time. The grid metaphor got started as the "Nolan Chart." Nolan was a Libertarian. 









 Because as any high school politics student knows, political alignments are not on a line (they're more on a grid, with x and y coordinates, etc.) 

I'm more of a "horseshoe" guy. I think that grid is Libertarian propaganda: "Wow, look, there's a party that believes in *both* types of freedom!" 

Right and left are labels given by American propagandists in the McCarthy era.

No, they come from where the factions sat in the French National Assembly after the Revolution.

His mistake was making his country a socialist dictatorship (communism), rather than a socialist republic.

I don't think he had a choice once he seized power. The majority of the Russian people in 1917 were rural and religious. They would not have voted for Bolshevism if given the chance. A Tolstoy-style religious socialism might have had a better shot. 




 Doesn't matter what they actually do or the fact that social programs are not 'socialism'

Yes, I like how people do not get that social programs are actually a phenomenon of capitalism. There is no welfare in Socialism because everyone is guaranteed a job (and compelled to work.) 

I'm not saying that's a *good* thing, but welfare is Capitalism *preserving* itself from a possible Socialist uprising.

One of Lenin's slogans was "He who does not work, does not eat." Makes him sound like a Tea Party guy, which he was in some strange way, that way the far left and the far right always seem to converge.
 




 Elaborate perhaps? 









 Turkey pasta. Better than it sounds. 




  Politics has always contained a transcendental element (often a phony one used as a lure, but that's a different issue.) In terms of an incentive, few things beat the promise or even the hope of transcendence. 




 "the flawed, selfish nature of man" is a religious percept.

Maybe, but also a Darwinian one. I don't think you can ignore that without socialization to the contrary, human beings care about themselves, their "tribe," and little else. 




 The simple man wonders what's for dinner.

 It was probably similar to those old questions on the SAT about culture-specific stuff that were designed to keep Jews out of Harvard. Taffy is probably something poor Koreans don't see much of. 




 The school system can fail kids without repercussions if needed. The budget isn't set according to how many students graduate. 

This is key. In the US there is tremendous pressure on teachers to pass everyone because funding and ratings are based on "on-time" graduation rates.

 My only disappointment was getting to the bottom and finding out Qu8k isn't for sale (yet...) 





























 Very interesting. Thanks for the response. One thing you said in particular caught my eye:

There are castes among Christians and Muslims too. 

We often read in the Western media that low-caste Hindus and Dalits are converting to Islam or Christianity to escape the caste system. Is that exaggerated or false in your view?
 




 I know some Hindus (and a former one) who would disagree with you. It is true though that there is no central authority in Hinduism, so different groups might have different interpretations. 

By and large though, Hinduism is an inherited tradition. You can't just go sign up to become Hindu like you can for some other religions. The "Western Hindu" groups like the Hare Krishnas and the Rajneeshis are considered fake, heretical or just plain laughable by (most) actual Hindus. 




 Assuming "The West" means the current hegemonic system lead by the United States, I would advise you to beware the "rhetoric of decline" which is used for political manipulation and doesn't really represent the underlying reality. The US is still the world's largest manufacturer, food exporter and its military technology is light-years ahead of anyone else's.

Unfortunately a number of commenters here have bought in to this rhetoric full-scale. For example, one stated:

china and other nations find themselves with a young strong backbone 

China does not have a young, strong backbone. They overshot their population decades ago, experienced apocalyptic levels of starvation several times, and are still paying the price. Their demographics are completely upside down now and the very old will soon outnumber those of working age.

I wouldn't be surprised if the US, Latin America and India form the power troika of 40 years hence while China, Japan and Europe all suffer greatly just from demographic pressure alone. 

The US will probably no longer be the lone superpower c. 2050 but it's quite possible it will still be one of the top dogs.  




 American Indians can be Hindus too if they want

Not Orthodox. You have to be born in the caste system to be considered Hindu. They could always be Hare Krishnas or something though. 



















 I suspected it might be something like this. However, would it be possible to create substances that are *digestible*, but, for whatever reason, don't give any energy to the body and/or cannot be stored as fat? Or would that create metabolic havoc?

 The government of Zimbabwe is pretty powerful, at least internally. Just ask all their political prisoners and dispossessed farmers. 




 If relatively harmless drugs like marijuana were legal, people wouldn't do this synthetic stuff. It should be banned, but then, pot should be legal as well. 




 That's my point though. Habitual drug users with no history of violence all of a sudden go nuts when they use this stuff. It might be close chemically to THC but in terms of reaction it's more like PCP. It's a drug that is a danger to the public, not just to its users. 




 [Here is one story](http://www.wwaytv3.com/2011/09/01/one-dead-another-custody-after-overnight-shooting-rocky-point). You can find plenty more searching police registers and medical journals. 

There was a case in a town near ours of a guy high on "bath salts" who tunneled into his neighbor's basement trying to kill him because he thought the guy was having sex with his wife. He had been a longtime marijuana user with no criminal record beyond possession and no history of mental illness.

Part of the problem with "bath salts" is they can be many different chemicals - you don't know what you're getting. I agree with a previous poster who said if marijuana was legal none of this would be happening, because most often this stuff is advertized as "legal pot" and sold in skate shops, head shops, etc. which pot users frequent. 




 He argues that a gold standard would force the government back into the price-fixing business. Not sure that's correct, but an interesting perspective. 




 Do you know anyone who's done this stuff? I'm fine with people using drugs that kill them, not so fine with them using drugs that cause them to go nuts and kill other people.  




 This stuff is bad news. Lifelong potheads have tried it once and ended up in the loony bin. For once I don't have a problem with the DEA. 









 don' think human nature is very malleable (which is the most basic idea of any kind of socialism: that people are programmed by relations and circumstances)

Good post, but I'd disagree with you there. Many Socialists believe there is a basic unchangeable human nature, for example Marx's idea of "primitive Communism" representing the original state of Man that will eventually reappear in the final state.

In this view Capitalism is the temporary, un-natural aberration which is part of the reason why it will collapse.

 True, but you can often counter-sue for damages that include your legal fees. I don't know how often that succeeds though. 









 Thanks, but it doesn't appear to be on the soundtrack. It was just background music to a few of the fights - the chanting might not have even been part of the "official" music track at all, I just really dug the combination. 









 Yeah, not quite what I had in mind, but thanks. 




 I heard such music in the background of a show (Soul Eater) and can't get the idea out of my head. Can't track down the artist though.  




 Ah, it looks like only the first two parts are posted with more to come tomorrow. Sorry guys. I liked the first two parts so much I posted before I realized that was all there was. 





























 It has not been established that the original speakers of IE are related genetically to the majority of today's speakers. The language is thought to have spread more from prestige influence and trade than military conquest, except in its earliest spread into the Danube Valley, where there is evidence of warfare.

So it's not like "some black people speak French" and more like "most people who speak French are unrelated to the original French nation, which we know very little about anyway since it ceased to exist 5000 years ago." 




 I don't think you can conflate "Aryan" and "white." The original people who used the word "Arya" probably were lighter-skinned, since they were from the steppes of Russia, but there are non-IE-speaking people who have light skin also, such as the Finns and Hungarians, and many darker-skinned people who speak IE languages and practice a descendant of the "Aryan" religion (most Hindus, for example.) IE is a language group, not a race. 









 "Arya" was a word in certain branches of Satem Indo-European that meant "priest," "aristocrat," or "practitioner of the correct religion or correct rituals" depending on the context. It was not used to mean "tribe" or "race." 

It is much more correct to speak of an Aryan religion that is the ancestor of both Vedic Hinduism and Zoroastrianism than an Aryan race.
 




 Cash did claim God gave him that song in a dream when he was high on Quaaludes, for what it's worth.

 Here in Michigan the private schools pay for their own buses, textbooks, etc...

Are you sure? I thought that was true in my state as well until a state senator told me otherwise. I was pretty shocked that my taxes pay to bus, heat and equip religious schools.

Have coaches teach gym class. 

They usually do, but they get a separate salary for coaching, at least in most districts in my area.

Require any part of the uniform that isn't customized to be returned at the end of the year (specifically, pants).

Haha, do you know what football uniforms look like by the end of the season? Usually there are multiple uniforms per player for each season because they rip and wear out.

private schools either learn to manage their finances REALLY well, or they disappear because they can't pay the bills.

Or they get the public to foot the bill for them, without any public oversight or standardized test "accountability" that public schools have to follow. Where I live, even some public schools are run by for-profit companies and are exempt from most state regulations, including the obligation to educate special-needs and learning-disabled students. It's sick. 




  How did these right winger Italians get to be so racist? You'd be hard pressed to find a more motley assortment of racial mixing than within the Italian peninsula. 

You've answered your own question. Racial identity anxiety is known to be linked with increased racism. See the American South with its rampant underground "miscegenation" during the pre-Civil War period for another example.

Niall Ferguson covers this issue in [The War of the World](http://www.amazon.com/War-World-Twentieth-Century-Conflict-Descent/dp/1594201005) - the book can be a bit dry but the section on racial anxiety is well worth reading. 




 Prior to the Putsch, as I understand it, the Nazis were a legal party from 1925 onwards TO the Putsch.

The Beer Hall Putsch was in 1923, you've got it backwards. They were briefly banned (and Hitler was jailed under cushy conditions), but legalized again in 1925. 









 At least in my state, joining the union is voluntary. That may not be true everywhere. 




 Actually, public districts are required by law (at least in my state) to bus private students as well, and even pay for the textbooks and heating costs of private schools (except for religious textbooks.)

Sports cost more than you think - coaches are paid in most districts, uniforms, league fees and transportation are expensive, as is insurance, and "the field" in sports-crazy towns is often more like a minor-league stadium. Then there's the marching band - I know for a fact a large district near me has a marching band budget of nearly $100,000 per year.

Disputes over grades and discipline should be handled by the teacher and the student's family, and maybe the school authorities if necessary. When it comes to grade disputes, parents should be required to provide evidence that their student did not earn the grade received or that the assignment was graded unfairly.

Here I agree with you, but that's not the reality of how things work these days.
 




 Salaries of union officials come from union dues, not district budgets. 









 You're probably right about the present time, there is more violent indoctrination among Muslims. However, most Muslims - ever very conservative ones - specifically forbid attacks on civilians, Muslims or not, and if you've seen movies like "Jesus Camp" you will know that Christians have "madrassas" of their own. 









 Only if you restrict your time frame considerably. Over the long frame of history I'd say both religions are equally bloodthirsty. 




 He is an [Obscurantist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscurantist#Restricting_knowledge) - he doesn't personally believe in the religion, but he thinks it is necessary for social cohesion.

Of course the media won't use that term... it's too, well, obscure. 




 Don't forget: They can expel disruptive students. Public schools cannot (unless they have committed an actual crime, like dealing drugs or assault, and even then sometimes they are only kicked out for 6 months or a year.) 




 A lot of times, the administrators are the Creationists. That's the small-town reality. 




 I'm all for paying teachers more, but where the hell is all that money going?

Administration, sports, legal costs (districts are sued constantly when they dare to actually fail or discipline kids), busing costs (no public transportation in most areas means districts maintain huge bus fleets of their own), physical plant (there are a lot of $100M-plus HS buildings in the US with terrible academics). 




 Save money and hire an inexpensive recent grad. Look good to the school board and the negative affects aren't seen until you've hopped to a different job. This BS goes on all the time in Nursing as well which is why unions are popular in both professions. 




 Those sorts of salaries are extremely unusual for public education. They do exist in some very wealthy districts, though. 




 Yep. Given the attitudes towards education in the US, without unions teachers would be earning close to minimum wage, and the jobs would be filled without regard to qualifications or knowledge at all, and would require a political connection to get.

(This all describes how most teaching jobs were actually filled in the early 60's and before, before the union movement really got started.) 




 Yeah, I get that sensory "vagueness" also, except with visuals which are very clear. 




 I was surprised to read that there is no smell or taste in dreams because that part of the brain is shut off during REM sleep. But come to think of it, I've never experienced smell or taste in a dream.

If this is legit, it could be a very effective way to check to see if you're dreaming. So my question is - has anyone experienced smell or taste in dreams?

I'm headed to bed to test the theory myself...

**UPDATE:** Didn't work. I ate a whole box of chocolates, and I thought I was tasting them, although, upon awakening, I couldn't recall the taste. So, maybe there is no taste in dreams, but if you *think* you're tasting anyway, it's useless as a reality check. 









 The Ice Age was over 10,000 years ago. It did not end in the Middle Ages.

 no one would suggest that the bartender who sold them the alcohol is the one responsible for the death.

Actually where I live, bartenders are legally responsible, so most bars take your keys at the door and you have to breathalyze before you get them back. We have among the lowest rate of alcohol-related driving injuries in the country, so it seems to work. 




 I do agree that there would be far fewer deaths if it could be sold on the open market.

Yes, but no one would want to sell it, because there still would be deaths, and the companies that made it would be sued out of existence unless they were given Congressional Immunity like the vaccine makers.

Then you'd just be back to your shady unreliable local "entrepreneur" just like now. 




 Absolutely correct, I was just demonstrating that probabilities can be calculated over infinite quantities.  




 If there are an infinite number of both, there is no way to start the argument

Sure there is - you can do probabilities over infinite quantities. For example, in almost all randomly chosen intervals on the set of natural numbers (which is infinite), you are more likely to pick a composite than a prime number, for example. 




 Not exclusively, though Marx did use it, and it is a term exclusive to the Left as far as I know (the Right would deny the very existence of rentiers.) 




 Thanks, this is the best explanation so far. I have another question for you: Is the Uncertainty Principle a *universal* principle of any conceivable universe, that is, is it a mathematical necessity? Or, are "Newtonian" Universes mathematically possible, but it just so happens that we don't live in one?
