 Re - glue it? 




 Bwahahaha! 




 1. Never go to bed angry.

2. True love is putting the other over oneself. If that happens on both sides, you're a happy couple.  If it's only one-sided, cut your losses, and find the right one. 




 Boy, that's a unique-looking lamp. 




 Psh, I'm married, and have 3 kids... can't afford a next gen console... much less have time to play it.  Hahaha! 




 No, but I miss it sometimes.

 2008 Ford Focus SE (Black)

2010 Mazda CX-9 (Black) 




 The child-catcher from Chitty-Chitty Bang-Bang always creeped me out.  

And the beginning scene from The Peanut Butter Hair Solution. 




 Yeah, not chant, but that was simply amazing. Great acoustics/reverb in that location as well.

Those harmonies were TIGHT! 




 Amen!  They don't seem to understand that we get tired of trying and not succeeding. 









 Nah, my daughter will drive my Ford Focus probably.  She can connect her phone via Bluetooth, and will only be allowed to CALL people; no texting.

I drive on the interstate, and see people texting, browsing the internet, e-mailing, etc. on their phones while we're going 70+ mph.  I'm just thinking, "WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?!" 









 She'd grind that transmission to a pulp in Baton Rouge, Louisiana's stop-n-go traffic. 




 Really?  I didn't know they believed that.  Learned something new. 




 I have a 15yo already talking about driving... she lives with her damn face glued to her phone.  This is the shit I'm afraid of. 




 The Legend of the Drunken Master was unbelievable! I was flabbergasted when I heard him say he had to deliberately slow the scenes and moves down some to make them distinguishable to movie-goers. 




 Where all the other techno-fads go. 




 Funny, but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JElywbkSbY) is the very first thing I thought of when I first heard of the Wii U. 




 No, you stumbled upon the yet-to-be-announced Ritz Tacos from Taco Bell. 




 Good find.  This video made me subscribe. 




 LOL 




 I've seen those!  I've also seen a 12-13yo girl walking around with shorts that had "paint"-like handprints on both ass-cheeks... as if someone with painted hands put hands on her ass.

She was a damn pre-teen! 




 What the hell is wrong with our society...?! 




 I've heard of about 80% of these, and all of them are fucking disgusting. 




 I've never been there, but I still chuckled. 




 Yeah, I've heard of the Gospel of Judas.

Not to mention an entire "bible" written by Lucifer himself. 




 I've seen someone eating cereal from a bowl while driving on the interstate. FROM A BOWL.  That take's two damn hands to do! 




 281,694 (at my work computer). 




 Ah, well... there you have it.  Thanks, /u/Bremstralung. 














 LMFAO!  I forgot about that.  How ridiculous! 




 Okay, that was pretty badass!  Good find, /u/Dennepis ! 




 Student body crap were always pointless positions. 




 In that case, have an "upvote"! 




 Was that supposed to be English they were speaking? 




 I guess I'm referring more to "blind from birth" blind. 




 I can't tell you how many times I've healed major bosses by summoning the same element as the boss (e.g., summoning Shiva on an ice-elemental boss). 




 Wouldn't that have killed all of the caster's companions as well? 




 Look!  It's Kung Lao's grandfather! 




 But I wasn't sure if it was similar to unused muscles becoming atrophied.  If a blind person doesn't really USE their eyes, do parts of the ocular system become "atrophied"?  That's kind of what I was thinking. 




 I wasn't sure what triggered the dilation.

Seems odd for the body to expend energy to do something that serves no real purpose (to a blind person, that is). 









 "[S]he doesn't know how to use the shells..." 




 It's no iLuminate, but it was good! 




 Sounds like a group of guys saying "Hey!" over and over again. 




 As an American, I vote for Miller Lite over Bud Lite.  Bud beers are gross.

My favorite beer of all-time is [Almaza](http://www.lacproducts.com/products/beer/Almaza.jpg). 




 No conflict there.  Forget the damn donuts! 




 Send myself a certified check for a large sum of money in the mail. 




 I stopped it when I heard the stupid-ass "Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!" junk in the background.  I can't stand that crap. 




 I have one too.  Damn thing over-boils onto my microwave every time.  That fill line is bogus. 




 Good Lord!  Don't eat them!  Cover them in clear coat to preserve them for a museum of never-seen-again objects! 




 For the life of me, I can't remember. 




 Yes, I am a conservatively-leaning Libertarian in Louisiana.

I used to love Jindal.  He's done a lot of good things for this state.

Lately, however, he's been saying some batty things. 




 As an American who doesn't watch soccer... this is what soccer is to me.  Acting... on a field... with a ball... 




 ...yeah... this was on the front page... 




 ***Mission: Impossible*** -- Great Movie.

***Mission: Impossible II*** -- Horrible Sequel.

***Mission: Impossible III*** -- Improved Sequel.

***Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol*** -- As good as the original.

***Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation*** -- I've got high hopes; don't let me down! 




 Haha!  Nice one, /u/MechaGrimm ! 




 I don't get it. 




 I started working at McDonald's the week after I turned 15. It wasn't a great job, but it was a job. As a very young person, your options are very limited. You take what you can get, and you don't bitch about it. 




 Hehe, poor person hates their cubicle,  and dreams of the beach. 




 Sunday morning, Tuesday morning, and Thursday morning.

I have some stubble on the between-days... enough that it's noticeable, but whatever. 




 Probably because no one watched it. 




 That's pretty ingenious, actually. 




 ...God, I love the internet.  HAHAHA! 




 Hehehe... ya got me.  Read the title, said, "WHAT?!".  Then looked at the pic, and said, "Ooooohhhh...." 




 No, people can be offended and say they are offended. The people that think being offended is against their rights is what annoys me. "That white man said the word 'nigger', and it offended me. I'm taking him to court!"

That kind of shit is what clogs our judicial system and makes us the lawsuit-crazy world we are. 




 This.

People think they have a right to not be offended.  "I'm offended by [whatever]!"  "Well, good for you.  Now shut the hell up." 




 Happy cake day, /u/problatikal.

You get karma from me, since I only got 15 on my cake day.  :-( 




 I know, right?! 




 See the brief clip of her doing do in my post above. 




 They can be linked together to form a dual-bladed lightsaber. 




 [**Yep!**](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/17/article-1183969-04F93680000005DC-780_468x336.jpg) 




 #1. It's spelled "Asajj".

#2. Asajj is a SHE.

#3. Only in the Clone Wars movie. [(See Link Here.)](https://youtu.be/uMeYEBuPxDM?t=1m) 




 [I'm too hip for this thread.](http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs15/f/2007/114/e/e/It__s_Hip_To_Be_Square_by_lucVision.png) 




 The fight scenes were the only good parts of that movie.  Acting was "bleh", story was "bleh". 




 I love Madeon's music.  "The City" is probably my favorite with "Finale" being a close second. 




 How about just limiting it to one-vote-per-person and legal voters?

Sounds like a LEGAL FRICKIN' PLAN TO ME! 




 Younger kids are more liberal-leaning because they are lazy and want things GIVEN to them instead of working hard to earn it.  They demand instant gratification. 




 Haha!  You know what I mean! 




 Yep, same here.  And she isn't as attractive as I remember her bring.  Now, she comes off as just being needy and whiney. 




 Great show.  Had a little crush on here. 




 Really?  Looks like a potato to me. 




 Man, Epona has some great muscle dexterity to hold that rearing pose so still for so long!  




 Boom Beach, AdVenture Capitalist, Link Dots, and SimCity BuildIt.  




 I prefer cane syrup myself.

My family gets together every year and make our own, but the Steen's brand here in the South is a good alternative. 




 Man, I friggin' loved the Wraith Squadron books.  Some of my favorite characters came from those books.  I have never laughed out loud while reading like I had at parts of those books.

 




 Thanks.  Apparently, unlike everyone else in /r/Catholicism, I'm not 100% well-versed with the catechism.  I'm assuming from his/her comment that /u/o_hai_mark can quote it like the Bible.  ((eyeroll)) 




 Let me play Devil's Advocate here... does the catechism ever describe self-pleasure as being a sin? 




 Good point!  Zedd is more of a "hippy", and loves food! 









 True. I do like the WoT series better overall... although it can be a tad too descriptive sometimes.  The SoT got a little repetitive and deus ex machina sometimes. 




 Not a problem for me with any embarrassing site, because I back all the way out, and purge my history every time I use my browser. 




 I'm gonna assume you mean:
 "I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass."

Gandalf is making three very specific references as both warning and challenge to the Balrog. by identifying himself as a servant of the secret fire (or Flame impersishable), Gandalf is identifying himself as a Maiar, an embodied angelic servant of the Valar protecting the light of Creation that Eru Iluvatar (or God) has set to burn at the centre of Arda (Earth).

Wieldor of the flame of Anor is a reference to his ability to draw on the power of the sun possibly through the Ring of Fire Narya but maybe also through his own divine origins.

Finally as he refers to the Balrog as the Flame of Udun, he informs the Balrog that he knows it to be a corrupted Maiar in the service of Morgoth from the earliest time when he resided as Melkor in his dark fortress of Utumno broken by the Valar at the awakening of the Elves. He orders it to retreat (go back to the shadows) or face the consequences of divine conflict and final judgement before the Valar Mandos the fate of all slain creatures. 




 Just finished re-reading the good part of the Sword of Truth series (leave out the later-published Richard and Kahlan series), and have started re-reading the Wheel of Time series again.

Which of the two characters listed above is your favorite, and why? 




 I've been looking forward to my cakeday ever since I learned what a cakeday was. I joined Reddit after I got sick of 4chan. I was getting to old for 4chan's shit... just like m00t apparently has.

I've enjoyed my first year here at Reddit. I learn about events before most other people. I see cool Internet things before they become mainstream. Etc.

Thanks, fellow Redditors, and I look forward to year 2! 




 So TODAY is my cake day? Why use past tense verbs, Reddit? 




 It says "celebrated" which is past tense. 









 "I love you." 




 Because it's an easy religion. It excuses pretty much any bad behavior. 




 A non-standard 9V battery I would assume. 




 Apply directly to the forehead. 




 Screw that!  It probably costs $25 for that stupid thing.

I'll take a $5.99 triple-chocolate meltdown any day. 




 "Beeps in tenth" 




 Why hello, Facebook image from a month ago. 




 1st Try: "Oops, okay... try again."

2nd Try: "Yeah--okay, we're leaving." 




 That's what most of these "prank" YouTube channels think they can do.  "It's just a prank!"  "It's for a video!"  "It's for YouTube!"

"Yeah--well, walking up and kissing my wife on the lips isn't funny, you asshole." 




 It's not Christmas now until I hear this song:

[Happy Holidays (Beef Wellington Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XJjW_Gelmo) 




 This guy is a dick. 




 We keep ours that way because we had kids.  Now that they are old enough to know better, we keep it like that out of habit. 




 Yay for stereotypes! 




 Saw that it was Ray Williams Johnson's channel and came back.

How DARE you spread RWJ crap over Reddit. 




 No, she was hired to do the work by the parish. 




 With severe skepticism.  




 So... a gay, black woman has it hardest of all then, eh?
