 Spank bank material. 




 Yep. 




 If they know they exist, like you're not banking overseas or in some strange location....once they have a death certificate they can pretty much get any information they want.  Went through this when my grandmother died and the crazy aunt started getting into things, she got access to the stuff faster than my parents did, even though my parents were handling my grandmothers finances at the end.

They are SUPPOSED to follow the directions of any will you might leave, so that might be a better idea to get sorted out. 




 Recently turned 36.  For years now I can't even picture a future where I think I'd be happy.  I can easily picture worse things to come.  When I go into a job interview and they ask me what Im passionate about, I have to try to make something up and try not to laugh at the absurdity of the question.

Lately I've been thinking about just giving away everything I own (not a whole lot) and just walking away from life.  I kind of think it's a fancy way of saying kill myself, but I don't know........there's some CHANCE there once everything else is gone maybe.  

Or that I need something horrible to happen to me, to give me a reason to feel bad that makes sense to other people.  If you're just a worthless lump trying to slowly climb your way out of the dark pit by getting a job, trying to find someone who likes you, etc....it's pretty hard to describe to normal thinking individuals why you haven't been working on your skills or whatever else.  Plus I would find it hard to trust someone whose mind is essentially betraying them if I were hiring a depressed individual like myself.

That there is when I start wondering what the point in continuing is, because I feel like I bring misery to everyone around me plus myself often enough that suicide might be tough...but they could move on and I could be done if I could just convince myself and pay for the costs associated with it somehow.  Some kind of terminal illness would solve it.
 




 I am interested in what you have to say and would like to subscribe to your newsletter.
 




 Fresco, looks like a Fresco to me. 




 They only care if you average X number of hours a night as far as I know.  I used to have a lot of days where I stayed up over 24 hours so I never used the machine on those days.

I wouldn't worry about it too much.  People get sick, if you dont have alternative masks to use and can't breathe through your nose..ain't much to be done about it.

BUT, if you run into the nose issues in the future, my experience is using some kind of saline spray or neti pot to get your nose open and then turn your humidifier up to see if it helps..if it's worse then turn it down to try to dry you out.  Usually turning it up is the solution to most of my nose inflammation issues. 




 Alcohol affects your sleep, makes your apnea worse.  Chances are certain pain medications will do the same thing.

They say 15 pounds requires a re-titrate for your apnea....

But if you have apnea caused by your brain, unless the pain medicine is causing it as a side effect...I don't see you being able to stop using the machine.

Different masks can make a big difference, but you might also need to get another test if it's been awhile.

I know I had a thyroid condition and diabetes that got treated and it drastically changed my apnea pressure levels, and I felt like shit prior to getting everything addressed.  Might be something else happening. 




 Everquest 2 was a decent looking game, I was in the beta...it played pitifully for me.  Maybe debugging, maybe hardware...been long enough I dont really remember what I had at the time.

But I was really disappointed the game was called Everquest considering how different it was.  I came in with an expectation and it was like everything got thrown out the window.  To this day when I go back to try it.......I still really don't see the similarities.  And find it to be rather odd and clunky to play considering it's the "more modern" version of Everquest compared to other MMOs of it's time.

It kind of goes to a line of thinking, that if they had just themed it anyway else and called it something else I probably wouldn't have been so hard on it.

Same with SWG, it has some really unique systems and such but never really felt "Star Warsy".  If it didn't have to measure up to Star Wars, it would have been a pretty unique and fun to play game that would probably have lasted longer.

Which was one of the points SOE said they were addressing by only using their own IP going forward........but they really didn't cut down on the hype and overpromising that pissed me off so much.  You buy in thinking, well it's good enough NOW...but when they get XYZ it's going to be awesome.  And then you finally realize they duped you again.  Eventually you have to stop rewarding that behavior and call them on the BS.   

And considering they are one of the few, if not the only MMO development house that could potentially run smaller MMOs with unique systems that would appeal to the "tired of the same old" former/less enthusiastic MMO players now it just.........wears on me to see them continuing to abuse those players instead of trying to cater to them.
 




 Star Wars Galaxies.....there's a CHANCE that LucasArts killed that game.  I've always heard they insisted on NGE.  

Matrix Online.....bought from a failed run.

Vanguard.....that got McQuaided.

But the ones I mentioned, those are entirely SOE driven.  So their comments and promises are within their control. 




 While I don't care about H1Z1, since the announcement is mostly here......

I'd just like to point out that SOE announcements have a history of basically blowing smoke up your ass by using language that is very non-specific.  Current path of development and operation could be that they were PLANNING on more micro transactions and it was unannounced yet.

Get some hard promises out of them with specific language so it's not 6 months down the road and you're 100-200 dollars in when you find out they don't intend to honor what you THOUGHT they meant.


Planetside 2 has basically rotted on the vine versus what Smedley was spit balling the game could turn into.  It has lost so many players because of the lack of progress..... buying the same weapon half a dozen times is .......just silly.  And the whole MLG bend, waste of time as it just doesn't appeal to a mass audience.  They never added resource collection or anything that doesn't focus around the FPS aspect despite loads of comments on it, etc.

Planetside 1 last time I played had people obviously cheating, using vehicle immunity hacks or hacks to take the spread out of their weapon shots for pinpoint firing while holding down the trigger.

I'd bring up Everquest, but since it was new and people didn't know what they could expect...I can forgive some BSing there.

Then it continued with Everquest 2......all that voice work that no one wanted and a complete redesign of the Everquest world and classes that was like a game with Everquest name tacked onto it.

Landmark, while interesting for building, just lacks the basic "life"/spark of minecraft.

Haven't heard much of anything about Everquest Next in a long time....so you have no idea what they plan on doing with it.

Only person worse for bullshitting people is McQuaid. 




 Just curious if you would elaborate on the field of information security.  Day to day stuff you might do, etc.  I see it listed fairly often in federal job listings. 




 If you have a cold/allergies sometimes I'll think it's my CPAP for a bit.

Otherwise.....not using the humidifier gets me sinus issues which comes off as a headache at times.

Usually when I had headaches due to lack of untreated sleep apnea, it was above my ears and high on my head on the sides.

If you can tap your forehead and around your eyes and it hurts, that's sinus pressure from something. 




 I think it's only federal positions allowed to post there.  And most of those spend the year on hiring freezes with little spats of unfrozen time to hire.  So they have A LOT of applications to choose from when the time comes to pick.


But to give you some idea of generally how a lot of government hiring goes.  Boss A hires Friend A, B, C, then and hires Stranger D, E, F.  Those friends are going to be put in any and all promotions Boss A has any say over.  And if Boss A moves up and out of the area, Friend replacing Boss A ends up acting just like him and hiring Friends to pass through the system as quickly as possible.  While everyone else not considered a friend can sit and spin unless they are willing to raise holy hell with the anti-discrimination guys to get people looking more closely at the nepotism going on.



Basically, I'm saying if you've worked in the real world only "private sector or way less fucked up public sector", you're going to be really pissed to see how it operates in federal positions unless you are working at the higher pay grades.


Although if you're bent on getting in, some of the bases use outside companies to do on-base work...and it's a good way to get the basic clearances and a leg up on outside of the system applicants. 




 You have some beautiful tits. 




 I've ordered stuff from Cpap.com without issue.  I don't know if they are the best on prices, but they had a decent selection. 




 Right, but you don't own the thing yet.  So he has no way of knowing what it will be like.

Like I said...they make A LOT of masks and products to make it more tolerable to partners.  And to be honest if you snore, I really doubt the rhythmic sounds of the machine are going to be MORE annoying than random gasps and gurgles during the night as you toss and turn during apnea events.

If it's SEEING you in it, then that's one thing.

If it's the NOISE, I doubt it will be a problem for long.

If it's something else, you need to figure it out.

End up with heart problems later in life if you dont get apnea taken care of due to the blood pressure spikes all night long.

Surgery is not very effective, and operations on your mouth are really quite painful to endure for not getting real nearly sure-fire results.


Unless there's some other weird reason, it sounds like he's just over-reacting to it.
 




 Unless you are sleeping in a room that is crypt quiet, people usually dont notice the machine running.  And if they do, they just put it above or below the level of their head to block the little bit of sound it makes.


If the mask is noisy, they make a lot of masks now that are made to diffuse air better.  Or come with cotton filters to cut down on the noise.

Get the machine, use it and see how much better you feel.  Then figure out the sleep arrangement....there's a lot of options to be had to make it more tolerable.  

Or just get to feeling so bad that you bitch at him all the time due to it.  Have noticed in quite a few people how much more tolerant they are once they've been on CPAP awhile. 




 As long as the dawn is anti-bacterial it's fine.  I use orange scented.

Don't soak your hose if it's heated.  Just put a drop in the non-connector end.  And stick your finger in the connector end to block the water and swish it back and forth.  Dump and repeat to get the majority of the soap out..

To me, the hose is the hardest part to wash and dry because of how it's made.  

Just try to get in the habit of doing it once a week, if you miss it's not the end of the world.  




 Really not much to screw up about it.  Just take the cloth part off your mask...and if you have a heated hose....you need to take care not to get the connector end wet.

Soak in dawn dish soap for the rest and rinse it off, wipe down with a dry cloth.  Done.

Most the masks are two parts, and the water chambers are two parts...

The filters can go longer..but they are super easy to clean (white ones you throw away when they start showing signs of build up and replace with new, black ones can be washed).
 




 They recommend to clean it each day, dumping any remaining water.  However if I have a significant amount of water left I let it go another night then dump it.

Mostly because some nights Ill barely use any water...and others Ill use a lot due to weather and humidity changes.  But I just hate dumping out a near full tank.   If you clean it regularly each week....and you're not letting it sit over 48 hours...   

Shrug.  Can really go crazy cleaning this stuff if you feel the need.  But I think my way strikes a decent balance for me.
 




 Little late to respond.  But I have asthma, and when I was first put on CPAP.....6-7 years ago.  It was really hard for me to relax on it and I felt like I had to breathe faster.

Most machines back down pressure when you exhale, which is a tremendous help.  So make sure that setting is on for sure.   

Then you need to get used to slowing down your breathing so it doesn't feel as suffocating.  I started taking really long in and out breathes like your doctor asks you to do when they listen to your lungs to exaggerate it...and you can feel how much easier it is to breathe on the machine when you do that.

Annnnnnnd while I've been on CPAP, I was put on Asmanex (inhaled steroid) which has virtually stopped my need for rescue inhalers.  Every so often I'll need the rescue inhaler when the allergies really start kicking in.  But generally I take the steroid inhaler maybe once a day or once every two days depending on the weather and how I'm feeling.  I think I can go up to like 2, maybe even 4 times a day according to my doc.  But really haven't felt the need.


Ever since they took the CFCs out of the asthma inhalers, I've felt like the rescue inhalers don't work as well.  They don't puff as hard, so when you're really struggling for breath you need to hit the thing 3-4 times to get what 2 puffs on the old CFCs used to do for me.  But that's one of those hard to judge things since Im older, etc.    I put that out there because I never have felt like the rescue inhalers really cut it for me for quite awhile, so something to consider if you're in the same boat. 




 Distilled water gallon jug is about a buck a gallon and lasts me over a month per bottle with my new heated hose-humidifier machine. It's WAAAAY more efficient on water than my older machine.

They recommend not using tap water because it can smell due to the chemicals used in it.  And can affect your lungs if you're sensitive to them.

Vinegar will remove build up in the water chamber if you don't use distilled.....maybe do this once a month.

And you should clean the parts of your machine weekly (mask, chamber, washable filter (black one), tube).  I usually soak my mask and chamber in dawn dish soap in as hot of water as you can manage.  

The tube if it's heated can't be submerged on the plugin side, so you put a drop in and plug off the plugin side with your finger and fill it from the other end a couple times.

And washable filter, I just rinse it under the sink...mostly to get any dust trapped in it out.

You can rinse your water chamber daily with a drop of dish soap if you are really concerned about germs, etc.
