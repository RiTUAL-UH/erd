 Couple of thoughts:

First some basics: Rice pasta is cheap and ubiquitous.  Rice breads are easy to find too, and not too expensive.  Order burgers with a lettuce wrap.  Rice / asian food is often your friend, but watch out for soy, which often contains gluten, however, you may be able to tolerate in small quantities.  If you're eating sushi, ask for tamari - many sushi places in big cities have this, but you have to ask.

Careful with steroids - oral prednisone  can cause bounce back.  Because your gut is most exposed, you get bounce back in the gut, which can lead to more food allergy. 




 Caananites, ancestors of modern Palestinians, predate the Israelites. 




 Are you talking about the state of Israel which was established by Irgun terrorists? 




 FN; DR. 




 Not when reality has a satirical bias. 














 "Hey guys, we need to do some human rights violations.  Sorry.  You can see yourselves out." 



















 The point being that Israel is worse than Apartheid?  

Yes. 




 I post about both.  I've long held the opinion that we ought not to be funding either. 




 Both primitive savage Islamic states and primitive savage Jewish states ought to be isolated. 




 Typical JPost garbage, perfectly illustrates pro-Israeli arguments:  ignore the main issue, the bombing of a densely packed open air prison filled with people whose homes have been stolen, and instead talk about lofty words in Israel's constitution.

This bit was particularly funny.

 "Israel has never had laws that overtly discriminated between citizens on the basis of race."

There are more than 50 Israeli laws that discriminate against Palestinian citizens of Israel in all areas of life, including their rights to political participation, access to land, education, state budget resources, and criminal procedures. Some of the laws also violate the rights of Palestinians living in the 1967 OPT and Palestinian refugees.

  Sharia Bolsheviks

LOL.  Careful, your extreme right wing ideology is showing. 









 The middle class is disappearing and class polarization is growing. 




  Even if Noam Chomsky is correct, he still sort of comes off as a nutcase.

Seriously, this is totally useless name calling. 

 Chomsky often wanders into these broader schemes that no one can immediately relate to or even imagine.

Have you ever read any of his books, or are you just responding to hearing fragments from him?   If your experience is growing up in the United States over the past 30 years, he's going to sound like an alien from another planet.  But, if that's not the case - you grew up during or before the 70s or were born outside, he's not such a stretch.  In any case, what matters is not the feeling he gives you, but specific cases.  Look into the details.  Chomsky tends to defend his positions with powerful scholarship. 




 Does anyone remember Unclaimed Territory?  I remember thinking that someone had finally come to take the torch from Chomsky.  Greenwald has a different style and his work has a much more journalistic focus, but he reminds me of Chomsky's deconstructive approach, letting establishment figures convict themselves with their own words.  




 These critics feel very emotional about Greenwald, but can do  little other than resort to name calling and unsubstantiated allegations.   




 The people criticizing him for his recent reporting  like Karl Rove's dancing partner, David Gregory, or Jefferey Toobin, believe that the press should only report what the government wants them to.  Were it up to them, Daniel Ellesberg would have been in jail.   




 You forgot "and being consistently wrong" 









 They should know.  Ferguson Police chief studied counter-terrorism methods in Israel: https://twitter.com/YourAnonNews/status/499762962077196288/photo/1 




 Have you spoken with her? 














 These mendacious hasbara efforts only serve to deepen  disgust for Israeli fascism.  The perception all over the world is that Israel, and Israelis, have turned into monsters, who steal, lie and kill, and then cry that *they* are the victims, even as they bomb the open air prison filled with those whose homes they stole.  Tell me again about those three Israeli kids.  What a joke.  All you are doing is cementing everyone's disgust at this country and its defenders. 




 You'll need a bath after fighting with this Hasbara troll. 




  Unfortunately, come November 2016, barring any "real" choice she will be yet another lesser of two evils.

I'm hoping Warren joins the race.  Without her, I agree, it's looking pretty bleak.

 But, as I said, even Bernie wouldn't criticize Israel.

Disappointing, but such is the culture of fear the Lobby has created.  I can't really blame him or Warren for their votes, though I'm not happy with them. 




 Agree that the Israel lobby holds great sway, however, I don't think Clinton is any way *forced* into the kind of hawkish stance she's taken.  Israel's actions have been decried across the world and are described as war crimes by major human rights organizations, yet not a peep from her about moderation.   

Very few are getting out as far ahead as Clinton is.  No one *forced* make the case for Israel, though they may be forced to take votes for them.  [Clinton is pushing the envelope here,  throwing her support behind far right policies.](http://www.mediaite.com/online/moveon-slams-clinton-for-embracing-policies-of-right-wing-war-hawks/ ).  

I understand you disagree with her statements too, but making excuses for politicians - "everybody's doing it, she has to too" - is really a way of giving cover to odious policies.  And in a small way, contributes to such politicians being able to get away with it.  The "left" in this country spends far too much time negotiating itself out of its own beliefs under the misguided idea that electing conservatives under our own brand counts for something.   The truth is that Clinton is a hawkish globalist, and we ought to be call her out on it. 









 Sell! Sell! 


































 Agree, but, it's one thing to go with the flow, another to bang the drums. 




 This article seems to confirm Hightower's claims:

 The jump in losses was largely due to a $1.5 billion increase in operating expenses as a result of workers compensation payments, the agency said.

 USPS blames much of its financial troubles on a 2006 mandate to stow away billions of dollars for its future retirees' healthcare. The Postal Service already defaulted on three of its payments into the fund and does not expect to make the next $5.7 billion installment due September 30.
 



















 We're in violent agreement. 




 Full text - part 2

Most remarkable of all, Clinton tells Goldberg that, If I were the prime minister of Israel, youre damn right I would expect to have security [control over the West Bank]. What makes this statement so remarkable is that earlier in the interview, Hillary praised the Clinton parameters outlined by her husband in December 2000. Those parameters permit Israeli troops to remain in the Jordan Valley, along the West Banks border with Jordan, for three years. Later in the interview, Clinton claims that she convinced Abbas to agree to allow Israeli troops to remain for six, seven, eight years and that she got Netanyahu to go from forever to 2025 as a date for their withdrawal. Even this, from a Palestinian perspective, represents painful backsliding from the position outlined by Hillarys husband. But as Hillary must know, Bibi three weeks ago said that in light of regional developments, there cannot be a situation, under any agreement, in which we relinquish security control of the territory west of the River Jordan. Which is to say that, as of now, Bibis position really does seem to be forever. Yet rather than challenge that stance, Clinton endorses it. 

Why does Clinton again and again endorse Netanyahus view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict even when it contradicts long-standing American positions? Because shes so willing to see the world through his eyes. Notice how she begins her statement about security control of the West Bank: If I were the prime minister of Israel. Theres nothing wrong with that. U.S. officials should understand, and empathize with, Israeli leaders, even right-wing ones. But whats missing from Clintons interview is any willingness to do the same for Palestinians. If its so easy to understand why some Israelis might want perpetual military control of the West Bank, why cant Clinton understand why Palestinians - after living for almost fifty years under a foreign army - might not want it to indefinitely patrol their supposedly independent state.

One of the hallmarks of Barack Obamas statements about Israel and Palestine, going back to his 2008 presidential campaign, has been his insistence on giving voice to the fears and aspirations of both sides. Writing about his trip to Israel in The Audacity of Hope, Obama wrote that, I talked to Jews whod lost parents in the Holocaust and brothers in suicide bombings; I heard Palestinians talk of the indignities of checkpoints and reminisce about the land they had lost. In Jerusalem last March, he spoke movingly, and in detail about the Jewish story, but also asked Israelis to put yourself in their [the Palestinians] shoes. Look at the world through their eyes. In her interview with Goldberg, thats exactly what Clinton does not do. Her interpretations of recent Israeli-Palestinian history reflect from a deep imbalance: a willingness to see reality through Israeli eyes and an almost total refusal to do the same for Palestinians.

For far too long, wrote Aaron Miller in 2005, many American officials involved in Arab-Israeli peacemaking, myself included, have acted as Israel's attorney, catering and coordinating with the Israelis at the expense of successful peace negotiations. From the beginning, Barack Obama has tried to avoid that. Although he hasnt brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace, he has tried to make good on his campaign promise to hold up a mirror to both sides. In Hillary Clinton, by contrast, at least judging from her interview on Sunay, Israel has yet another lawyer. And a very good one at that.

Israels new lawyer: Hillary Clinton

Whos the Israeli governments best spokesperson? Ron Dermer? Michael Oren? Bibi himself? Nope. Its Hillary Clinton. In her interview on Sunday with Jeffrey Goldberg, Clinton offered the most articulate, sophisticated, passionate defense of Netanyahus conduct Ive heard from a government official on either side of the Atlantic. Unfortunately, important chunks of it arent true.

Lets take her claims in turn.

In his first term, Netanyahu moved towards a Palestinian state

Clinton began her defense of Bibi by noting that in his first term, in the late 1990s, he had give[n] up territory and moved in that direction [towards a Palestinian state], as hard as it was.

Thats extremely generous. Its true that in 1997, Bibi withdrew Israeli troops from most of the West Bank city of Hebron (though they can reenter any time Israel wants) and the following year signed the Wye River Accords, under which Israel was supposed to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority (though Bibis government fell before it could do so).


What Clinton leaves out is that Bibi only agreed to these withdrawals to forestall the far larger ones envisioned under the Oslo Accords he inherited from Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres. In 1993, when Oslo was signed, Bibi publicly compared it to Neville Chamberlains surrender of the Sudetenland to Adolf Hitler.

He accepted Oslo in the 1996 election campaign only because he couldnt repudiate a process endorsed by the Israeli center and championed by the United States. So Bibi sabotaged Oslo by accelerating settlement growth and minimizing the amount of land Israel relinquished. Before I took office, he later boasted, the conception was to give away everything except for two percent [of West Bank] while I turned everything around and gave just two percent to [full control] of the Palestinian Authority. Or as he told settlers after leaving office, I stopped the Oslo Accords. 


The Clinton administration officials who dealt with Bibi in his first term understood this all too well. Neither President Clinton nor Secretary [Madeleine] Albright believed that Bibi had any real interest in pursuing peace, writes Dennis Ross in The Missing Peace. Ross deputy, Aaron Miller, adds in his memoir that, all of us saw Bibi as a kind of speed bump that would have to be negotiated along the way until a new Israeli prime minister came along who was more serious about peace.

Thats a far cry from what Hillary told Goldberg. Then again, Ross and Miller arent running for president.

Bibi agreed to a settlement freeze but Abbas wouldnt negotiate

Fast-forwarding to the Obama years, Clinton claims that, I got Netanyahu to agree to the unprecedented settlement freeze It took me nine months to get Abbas into the negotiations even after we delivered on the settlement freeze.

Whats striking, again, is what Clinton leaves out. The settlement freeze was indeed, unprecedented. Unfortunately, it didnt actually freeze settlement growth. Its not just that, as Clinton admits, the freeze exempted East Jerusalem. Even more importantly, it exempted buildings on which construction had all ready begun. This loophole proved crucial because, as the Israeli press reported at the time, settlers spent the months preceding the freeze feverishly breaking ground on new construction, on which they continued to build during the ten month freeze, before breaking new ground once it expired. As a result, according to Peace Now, there was more new settlement construction in 2010 - the year of the freeze - than in 2008. As Obama administration envoy George Mitchell admitted to Palestinian negotiator Saab Erekat, the Obama administration had wanted a freeze that truly stopped settlement growth but we failed.

Clintons claim that Abbas refused to negotiate until the last minute is disingenuous too. In fact, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met repeatedly during the freeze. In January 2010, just over a month after it began, veteran Israeli columnist Ben Caspit reported that, In the past weeks, Israeli representatives, including Netanyahu, have repeatedly rejected official documents that their Palestinian counterparts have tried to submit to them, with details of the Palestinian positions on all the core issues. The Israeli representatives are completely unwilling to discuss, read or touch these documents, not to speak of submitting an equivalent Israeli document with the Israeli positions.

While reporting my book, The Crisis of Zionism, I heard four different Obama officials confirm this account. During the settlement freeze, the Palestinians submitted to Netanyahu and his aides the same positions they had submitted to Netanyahus predecessor, Ehud Olmert. These included a Palestinian state on the 1967 lines with a 1.9 percent land swap for territory inside Israel proper, Israeli control of all the Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, international troops in the Jordan Valley and the return of 150,000 Palestinian refugees over ten years. The Netanyahu government, by contrast, steadfastly refused to discuss the parameters of a Palestinian state.

In her interview with Goldberg, Clinton never mentions that.

Netanyahus views on Palestinian statehood resembled Ehud Baraks.

Given the evidence that during her time as secretary of state, Bibi refused to discuss territory, Clintons claim that I saw Netanyahu move from being against the two-state solution toconsidering all kinds of Barak-like options is bizarre. Whatever you think of Ehud Baraks offer at Camp David in July 2000, it was a detailed offer. Netanyahu, by contrast, refused put forward a territorial proposal not merely during Clintons term, but during John Kerrys far more aggressive effort to broker a deal. During the Kerry negotiations, according to Haaretzs Barak Ravid, Netanyahu flatly refused to present a map or even to discuss the subject theoreticallythroughout the nine months of the talks Netanyahu did not give the slightest hint about the scale of the territorial concessions he would be willing to make.

Its too bad Goldberg didnt press Clinton on what kind of Barak-like options she heard Netanyahu propose, because the best reporting we have suggests he offered no territorial options at all.

Netanyahu is right to demand indefinite control of the West Bank

 














  you're promoting division based on religion.

I think Israel beat us to that one. 




  Jews so special that they're the only nation on earth that isn't allowed to have their own country

The Jews aren't a nation.  They're a religious group.

When religions have their own country, well, we have a word for that.  Pakistan can call itself the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, but it's not recognized as such, rather only as the Republic of Pakistan.  

Official religions and privileged classes are the perfect recipe for failure, such is the case, as we have seen, with Israel. 




 An Israeli Hasbara tactic - frightening your critics into silence. 









 TL;DR.  Without any irony, a Conservative accuses the left of not thinking.

 Thanks so much for the help! 









 The whites in South Africa worried about the same thing. 



















 lol 




 The followers of bin Laden are smart enough to know that a military budget requires provisions for both offense and defense.  Funding for defense is in the end a line item on the plus side of the balance sheet, which leaves more room in the budget for weapons.  

It really doesn't matter if you or I see it another way.  The enemies of Israel see us supporting them, and they hate us for it.  If the US were to give $225M for a Palestinian Iron dome too, it would be a different matter. 




  If an ancestors land ownership constitutes the right for a descendent to own it, then the Jews are the oldest group today that can trace itself back to ancient Israel.

 1) Premise/Assumption: Original ownership of land passes to children/grandchildren/so-on.

The Palestinians are the Canaanites who predated the Jews.  

Conclusion:  Palestinians have a claim to ownership of Palestine.

 2) Premise/Assumption: Whoever currently controls a land is the owner.

If that were the case, there should have never been pressure to rid South Africa of its racist regime.  

This premise isn't accepted.

Israel is a defacto Apartheid system, imposed only very recently, and the cause of great instability in the region.  

 3) Premise/Assumption: Controlling a land for 25/50/75/100/200/300/400/ years means that it becomes your land, until another group can hold that land for 25/50/75/100/200/300/400 years.

Again, see the answer to 2).  That is what we are here to discuss.  Land rights.  The Israelis obtained theirs by displacing the people who had lived there for centuries, which is the direct cause for the current problems in the region.  

 




 Why? 




 Truly idiotic. 




 They're only human shields if Israel won't fire on these areas - but Israel *is* willing to fire on these areas, so they're not human shields.

A better explanation is that Hamas militants are using the buildings as cover.  What we can conclude is that *both* Israel and Hamas don't care about civilian casualties. 




 Both historically and recently, they have the antecedent claim to the land.   




 from [Osama bin Laden's 'letter to America'](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver )

 (Q1) Why are we fighting and opposing you? 

 (1) Because you attacked us and continue to attack us.

 a) You attacked us in Palestine:

 (i) Palestine, which has sunk under military occupation for more than 80 years. The British handed over Palestine, with your help and your support, to the Jews, who have occupied it for more than 50 years; years overflowing with oppression, tyranny, crimes, killing, expulsion, destruction and devastation. The creation and continuation of Israel is one of the greatest crimes, and you are the leaders of its criminals. And of course there is no need to explain and prove the degree of American support for Israel. The creation of Israel is a crime which must be erased. Each and every person whose hands have become polluted in the contribution towards this crime must pay its*price, and pay for it heavily.

 (Q2) What are we calling you to, and what do we want from you?

 The American people are the ones who pay the taxes which fund the planes that bomb us in Afghanistan, the tanks that strike and destroy our homes in Palestine, the armies which occupy our lands in the Arabian Gulf, and the fleets which ensure the blockade of Iraq. These tax dollars are given to Israel for it to continue to attack us and penetrate our lands. So the American people are the ones who fund the attacks against us, and they are the ones who oversee the expenditure of these monies in the way they wish, through their elected candidates. 









 You realize that only a few decades ago, terrorist attacks against Americans were completely unthinkable.  That was before our interventionist foreign policy, and when we were seen as a neutral broker in the Middle East.

 Blowback.

This is really terrible.  Let's have none of that here. 




 True on American taxpayers and Raytheon, but truth be told, *all* Palestinians are the losers, but the 87% of Israelis who support Netanyahu no doubt are quite pleased.

 What you're advocating is giving money directly to the .001%.  That will line their pockets, not help everyone else.  Corporations aren't struggling because there isn't capital floating around.  Remember the billions that we gave to the banks?  Or all that money that rich people already have?  

The problem is that regular people don't have money.  Giving it straight to corporations is just going to make things worse.

 




 That is really depressing.  If she sincerely believes in it, that's almost enough to make me write her off.  I hope this is just a political calculation.  I think it would be impossible for a Presidential candidate to vote against something like this and have any chance in this climate.  So for now, I'm going to assume this is a matter of picking battles. 




 And it creates terrorists for free! 


































 The presence of Israel on the holy sites is one of the prime recruiting reasons for radical Islamists.  

The bigger problem is that the US wants control of the region.  Israel is out proxy there.  And that's the reason OP's post will only be a wild pipe dream - that is, until regional oil supplies are no longer important. 









 That's why the blockade has been condemned by the UN and several human rights organizations.  But, in the Orwellian world of the hasbara activist, the Israeli imposed Palestinian "diet" is a great, generous humanitarian act.  

Good grief. 




 The check for your hasbara services is in the mail. 




 I have no idea what any of this is about.   









  Hamass can stop hiding among and behind women and children any time they want, but they do not. 

Hamas has been accused of using human shields, but this only works if the opponent cares about civilian casualties.  Obviously, Israel does not.  

 Hamas bears much of the blame for this violence. They have been preparing for it for some time given the complexity of tunnel networks.

Is see, some of the individuals of the open air prison have rebelled.  Since we've already accepted that collective punishment is an acceptable approach, might as well kill prisoners arbitrarily, right, whether they were involved or not.  Hopefully they will learn to cower before their masters,  the thieves who stole their ancestral properties, once enough of their children are dead.   

 They were elected to lead, and instead of building schools, infrastructure, and bettering the lives of civilians; they build missiles, bombs, suicide vests, and tunnels.

LOL.  Let's ignore the fact that the Israeli government blocked supplies to the open air prison after Hamas won the vote, right?  Or as that senior Israeli official described it:  "**[The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Weissglass )**"

Fucking evil genocidal sacks of shit.  But the world is starting to learn the truth, despite the best efforts at selective story-telling by the hasbara brigade.  Israel is being seen for what it is - the Nazi's Frankenstein monster - and world public opinion is repudiating it.   




 Responding by killing over a thousand Palestinians = "getting a pass".

Spoken like a true supporter of Israel. 




 For Israel, everything is permitted.

Move along.

  The Shah of Iran hates us for our actions in 1953, nothing to do with Israel. 

The Shah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi, was a close ally of the United States.  His secret police, SAVAK, were notorious for disappearing and torturing his opponents.

[Saddam was a US ally, as was Osama bin Laden.](http://www.juancole.com/2005/08/fisking-war-on-terror-once-upon-time.html )

The point is that our support for Israel is just one aspect of our  meddling in the Middle East.  It has produced negative consequences for us.  At one time, it was unthinkable that the US would be the target of terrorist attacks.  It was seen as a fair and unbiased actor in the region.  However, after years of self-interested intervention, as the CIA warned, we're experiencing blowback.

**EDIT** grammar 




 Our support over the years of Israel and other brutal regimes in the region - Shah of Iran, Saddam, the Saudi dictatorship - is the #1 reason cited by leaders of anti-US groups like Al Qaeda for their actions against us. 

I think you're vastly underestimating the cost of our support for Israel. 




 As a Canadian, I second the sentiment.

  The US doesn't do business that way and we try to put in power a democratic government.

  We also did a "regime change" in Serbia/Kosovo, and there's not "brutal chaos" there.

That is a valid argument.

 It's no small coincidence that the US is more active in more volatile parts of the world and that volatile parts of the world are more likely to descend into chaos.

1. But if the US tends not to be successful in interventions, we should tend not waste blood and treasure by intervening.
2. In some of the cases (e.g., Iraq), the regions are unstable because of previous US interference (i.e., CIA/Mossadegh).

logical fallacy

**EDIT** For all the down voters - do you understand what a [logical fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_fallacy ) is?

This argument has the structure:

1. ALL P ARE Q

2. Q

3. THEREFORE Q MUST BE A P

4. BUT Q IS NOT A P, THEREFORE (1) IS FALSE

I.e.,  an invalid argument - a classical logical fallacy.

Translating, Sleekery is arguing:

1. All countries which the US regime changed (P) are countries which descended into chaos (Q)

2. Syria descended into chaos

3. Therefore Syria must be a country which the US invaded

4. But Syria wasn't invaded by the US, therefore (1) must be false...

An invalid argument.

 I don't believe that the entire Progressive caucus supports this, rather I read this as abject cowardice. AIPAC has a stranglehold over our politics, and even the most stalwart progressives can't say a peep about it.  

But, I think it's unfair to single out one politician - just imagine being the *only one* of all your colleagues to criticize Israel.  That is guaranteed to come back and bit you.

 No, I agree that is pretty clearly biased. 

Yet, a lot of this article rung true to me.  I think Clinton, if elected President, will be a disaster for progressives.  I've heard nothing out of her mouth that I believe.  Even when she talked about income inequality recently at the Aspen Ideas conference, it sounded like she was bullshitting.  She so carefully couched her words that it seemed like a nod and a wink to her fellow globalists: "just what the proles want to hear, don't you know".  That has been my impression, anyway.

 




 What do you disagree with? (I'm not a right wing troll, if that's what you're thinking - quite the opposite). 









 That is awesome, thank you.  I'll never buy another thing from them.

 Greenwald makes the point that he's not incompetent, but is actually competently achieving his goals. They are just different from what progressives want to believe.

 "Spitzer". 




  Hobby Lobby did not object to covering typical "birth control," and, if I'm reading this decision correctly, is not exempt from covering combined oral contraceptives (i.e., the medication that nigh everyone thinks of when you say "birth control").

 To that end, I'm sorry to say, I think Sen. Warren is being disingenuous, as is any reporter/opinion writer that implies that this case applies to a broader scope than written.

You are wrong:  [the SCOTUS clarified *the very next day* that the decision applies broadly to the entire contraceptive mandate, not just the handful of methods that Hobby Lobby objected to](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/scotus-says-hobby-lobby-ruling-applies-broadly ).  

Even without this, why would you think Warren is being disingenuous when she is merely echoing the ideas in Ginsburg's dissent?  We should be thankful for her voice on this issue. 

 The privately traded company Hobby Lobby is wholly owned by devoutly religious peoples, and therefore should have access to the same exemptions as other religious employers.

Under this theory, companies owned by religious people are indistinguishable from religious institutions, so shouldn't have to pay any tax at all.  But that is obviously false.  Religious institutions and charities are categorically different from corporate employers, which is why we treat them as such everywhere in US law.   HSS did not open the door to anything.







 




 What exactly are you remembering?  Obama was an extremely lackluster Senator. [An assessment by 7 liberal interest groups ranked him as among the least liberal"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_career_of_Barack_Obama#Legislation_and_voting_record ).  Warren is already a huge force in the Senate - so much so that some progressives mistakenly argue that "we need her to continue doing what she's doing in the Senate".  Not so for Obama, that's for sure -- what exactly did he do?  

I remember quite well because a very close friend of mine was an ardent supporter of his.  At that time, I was following Obama's record quite closely.  And another friend, an African-American lawyer who was at Harvard Law a few years after Obama,  also followed his career closely.  There was *very* little in the way of actual legislative achievements to indicate his governing style.  The one thing of note was that Obama would do a good job of explaining each side's arguments - at Harvard Law school and in Illinois - and that was his great strength, expressing the interests of both sides of the argument.  His whole life has been about playing the middle.  If you think he was some great success in the Senate, you ought to supply some data.

  




 Right - it has nothing to do with Eric Holder putting [this asshole](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/03/29/lanny-breuer-and-the-immorality-of-our-morality.html) in charge of bank fraud:

 Breuer expressed his prosecutorial philosophy thus: "In reaching every charging decision, we must take into account the effect of an indictment on innocent employees and shareholders," Breuer said. "Those are the kinds of considerations in white-collar crime cases that literally keep me up at night and which must play a role in responsible enforcement."

... before he left for a $4M a year job working for banks.
 




 The problem is people weren't paying attention: telecom immunity, supporting Joe Lieberman over Ned Lamont, "Reagan is the model president", and "American needs bipartisanship" - were all pretty clear signals about what kind of President Obama was going to be.

Warren has been spent her whole career actually  fighting for the issues she's stumping about.  Not so Obama. 




 Who is Eliot? 




 What's annoying is that people aren't paying attention to the details.  Obama's message was that bipartisanship was the answer, and Reagan was the president he'd emulate.  Warren has been writing and testifying about income inequality from before she got into politics. 




 Obama has governed very conservatively, and there was every indication he was going to do that in the primaries.  Not so for Warren. 




  You're 100% right, Warren does not have an outstanding voting record (just like Obama).

This is totally wrong. 




 Obama had no track record of doing anything progressive.  His core message was about bipartisanship ("one America, not two", remember?) - this is why I was never a fan of his.  He showed he was a conservative during the primaries -- he supported telecom immunity; supported Joe Lieberman over the excellent progressive, Ned Lamont; praised Reagan as a model president; there were several actions like this that showed he would govern as a conservative.  He even stated that his supporters ascribed their own politics to him, though he was more conservative than they thought.

But... you have to pay attention to the details.  If you don't, you're likely to reach the conclusion that "everything is the same".  But it's not - what did Obama actually achieve before he was elected?  Nothing.  What did he actually fight for?  Nothing - he gave a pretty speech at the convention about the need for bipartisanship.  It was clear what we were electing. 




 We ended up coding Twitter/FB shares using just the libraries provided by them/iOS Apis  




 I spent so much time trying to get ShareKit to work - it's really a huge disaster.  The approach seems to be super-aggressive on releasing auth credentials.  What this means is, if you rely on Facebook auth as a means for being logged in to your own app, simply by doing a ShareKit share, the user can be logged out of your own app  

I tried pointing this out to the maintainers, and issued patches, but they didn't accept them.  There are several other problems.  Even though it seems to have a lot of integrations, it's really not worth the trouble, in my experience.   




 [Ginsburg talks about exactly this issue in her dissent.] (http://www.newsday.com/opinion/columnists/anne-michaud/the-murky-hobby-lobby-decision-anne-michaud-1.8823229) Hobby Lobby is refusing to pay for IUDs, which can cost a month's wages.  Ginsburg argues that the employers are effectively *preventing* any use of that form of birth control for their employees.  

If members of SCOTUS are saying this, I think Warren is on pretty solid ground.

On another note, it seems that progressives have been fighting losing battles when they second guess themselves and pull their punches.  I'd say that the complaints you have against her are exactly the reason she's ought to lead the party --- she puts the progressive argument on an offensive stance.  (And she's right).  That's how we're going to win battles going forward, not hedging and qualifying things as though we're in philosophy class. 




 There's more than just this Supreme Court ruling: shutting down of clinics, forced vaginal ultrasound, etc.  It's not a stretch to describe what the Rs have been doing as an all out assault. 




 According to this video, the split between American and British pronunciation was happening right around the time of the Declaration of Independence.  So, the Founding Fathers could have been the new accent or the old:
