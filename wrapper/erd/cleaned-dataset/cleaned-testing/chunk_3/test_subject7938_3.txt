 Nope. Not an oak anyway. Grafting only works between closely related groups. Usually the "family" designation is the bounary. If you look at the website you provide, you'll see that the fruits group together by how they are related. 




 Find one. Just one. 




 Of course, we can now isolate genes so they don't spread in the pollen (by inserting into the chloroplast genome). No one yet has because the cost of deregulating a single transgenic event is about $100 million. So, due to unscientific review processes, we're all stuck with the old technology because the incremental increase in prfit doesn't offset the investment. It's also the same reason you don't see start-ups breaking into this market. 




 That's actually not true. Yes, genes can move through pollen, but Monsanto has never actually brought suit to farmers with accidental gene trasmission. Most people are familiar with [this suit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Canada_Inc._v._Schmeiser) but remember it as Monsanto crushing some farmer. In reality, the defendant violated Canadian patent law by intentionally growing the protected seeds.

I challenge anyone to find a case where Monsanto actually sued a farmer for accidental contamination. And don't just find some crappy blog. Find court documents supporting your position. 









 I'll be honest, the ID was just based on growth habit on a norway maple. It's a relatively new disease in the United States. Somewhere, there exists some dichotomous keys. They usually rely on the shape of appendages on the chasmothecia and the number of asci and spores. You'd have to google around.

If you find scenescent leaves infect with mildew you may find the small black stuctures. I did a wet mount with those. Then with the end of a pen or probe, you can press on the cover slip until it cracks. You can usualy hear it crack. As water moves in the asci swell and poke out.

It's fun. 




 I study plant pathology, so I love it. They are one of my favorites. 














 I'll be there. Whoo! 




 There are occasional "Full Moon Runs", usually in the summer. Keep an eye on the website for when those are. It's also somewhat unwise to set a run before you've done a few. Sorry dude. 




 Respiration of 1 gram of fat (plus O2) gives about 1.1 grams of water (plus CO2). 




 Well, the core started hot from the materials condensing into a planet and rock insulates pretty well but that's only part of it.

Radioactive decay is the rest. This continually releases energy within the earth, keeping it hot. On the upshot, this is also where the helium comes from.

Yes, it can eventually run out and solidfy. This is what happened to Mars. Mars, being a little smaller, has a greater surface area to volume than the Earth and cooled faster. 




 First: Not a race, you racist.

J/k, Taking a guess based on the hares (the people setting the trail) and that fact that it's March Madness, it is probably a start of a Saturday. However, there is a strong chance of drinking at bars until 2. That happens kind of a lot. Some hashes are all night or even all weekend affairs. 




 Well?? 




 Because I have shit to do and "tin" is some number fewer syllables. 




 Sometimes fails look really neat. 




 Yep, and for all ages. Just have a sense of humor and don't wear nice clothes (it's not always on roads). I am trying to get over my hangover from yesterday's run. There was something with apple cider and everclear. I have a headache. It was a good time. 




 Cool story bro. 




 It's called ice. You can't drink ice, but once pretreated properly it becomes ingestable. 




 The first and formost reason is speed. If it takes about 5 years to go from seed to a fruiting tree then during the career of a plant breeder they may only be able to do 6 or 8 generations, at best. As compared to something like beets or beans, where you might get 2 generations a year, progress is slow.

The second reason is mangos act a bit like apples. Apples do not "come true to seed" and neither do mangos. Each tree that comes from one seed has a huge degree of variability which makes it hard to breed for any particular trait. Any worthwhile apple tree that, partly by luck,  happens to have good qualities is propagated by grafting (a form of cloning). The same is true for good quality mango trees.

Third is economic. It's sad, but the rich countries either haven't cared about mangos or don't grow mangos, or both. This is true for a lot of crops and as government funding asymtotically approaches zero, most crop breeding is focused around crops companies can make a living selling.

Fourth, is that no one likes GMOs. Making a safe, seedless mango is close to trivial using modern techniques. It could be made in the same way the seedless grapes, watermelons, and bananas have been made all of which are clearly safe. But! No one likes a GMO, so we're stuck with seeded Mangos and a whole pile of other foods that might be made better. My wish is tearless onions, but hey, not 'til education is fixed.



  




 That's usually only a temporary condition. 




 And if you like a ton of beer while you're running, try the [Hash House harriers](http://www.madisonh3.com). Also, some nudity.
