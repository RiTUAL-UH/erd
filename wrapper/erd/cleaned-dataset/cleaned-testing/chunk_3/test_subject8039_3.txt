 I don't think I ever noticed that!! You, dear potter head, are awesome!!!  




 And I would be honoured to be among those numbers alongside good brothers and sisters  




 Oh yes. It's real to us.  




 So I'm rereading the fourth book for the 400th time. And I'm at the graveyard with Harry. And I noticed something. One of the trees mentioned is a yew tree. And voldemorts' wand is made of yew. Thought it was an interesting little tidbit!!  




 Welcome home, friend!! 




 I like this idea. This one seems like the most likely to me.  




 Is anyone else curious as to how a howler doesn't explode en route? Like, what kind of magic is used for that? What if a howler had to be sent to somewhere like Bulgaria from England? Just thought of this!!  




 Not all the trials are present before getting to the sorcerers stone.  




 And this is what I was trying to point out :) thank you.  




 Think about it. JKR says that the process for making a Horcrux is difficult and time consuming. If we hold this to truth, then how was Harry "accidental"? Voldie would've had to have had this planned out, correct? Share your thoughts!!
