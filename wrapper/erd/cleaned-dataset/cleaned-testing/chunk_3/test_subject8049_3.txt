 My wife picks one night a week to prep meals in advance (crockpot, casserole, etc), puts them in freezer bag or tupperware and freezes them. All I have to do when I'm home before her (we have three kids) is thaw and cook. 




 As a recovering drug-addict (sober 4yrs1mo16day)... That is some really good talk you hear all the time in meetings!

"If you have one foot in the past and one foot in the future, you are pissing all over the present."

"It's called the present for a reason, because it is a gift."

 It was an attempt at humor because so many people act like The Affordable Healthcare Act is ruining their lives and/or country. But I recently accepted a good where I had to sign up for healthcare independently and have greatly benefited due to the ease and affordability of the process. 




 It's probably heroin addicts shooting up and then pissing/shitting themselves.

 ...as long as he could "take" every woman as his wife. In those days, "take as wife" = "rape". 




 The Affordable Healthcare Act 




 People with Downs Syndrome... My grandfather was the landlord of a house that was leased to use as a home for orphaned Downs Syndrome people. I would visit often with him during the summer and developed MANY lasting memories.

 I would choose Biscuits   Gravy, PB   J, and Ribeye Steak (Medium-Rare). 














 If a government institution (and it's constituents) is deciding whether or not a mother can choose to give birth to her own flesh and blood, then it can expand welfare to all the women and children suffering due to the force behind such a choice. 




 Monty Squared? 




 I believe what she is referring to is the people who are "pro-life" and "anti-welfare"... it seems, IMO, that the people forcing women to have a baby that they cannot mentally, physically, or financially take care of are the ones that are unwilling to provide for them once they have sacrificed a career, a life, or an education to raise the baby. 




 I'm pro-choice because I've never been a fourteen-year-old incest victim pregnant by her father, or a woman who's going to die if the pregnancy continues, or a rape victim, or even a teenager who made a mistake. I want women to have choices, but I also believe that it's a life, especially once it's big enough to live outside the womb.

EDIT: I'm a man. 




 That... is... bad... ass! 




 Hey, if it's perfect for meat spin, it's perfect for porn!

 "Doesn't matter who"... Good to know 




 Referring to humanity as "the humanity" 




 "The process is a breakthrough because it only takes minutes. Previous methods of refolding proteins can take days and to avoid this scientists rely on expensive production methods. For instance when making cancer antibodies, scientists use expensive hamster ovary cells because they dont often misfold proteins. Cancer researchers, the pharmaceutical, agricultural and other industries could also save much of the $160bn they spend on proteins each year."

 HIRED! My thing with flight is that it offers a limited amount of perks. Invisibility offers an unlimited amount of perks, due to the fact that you could go anywhere unseen.
