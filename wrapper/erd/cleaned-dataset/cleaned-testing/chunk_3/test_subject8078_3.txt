 Pushed it far right. Oh well.  




 SO CLOSE 




 The **NYT 4th Down Bot** said the Bucs punted on a 4th and 1 at their 27. It's too close to call. 

So I guess that is good? 




 Good rush DWill

 HOLY SHIT TD KB 




 With like 2min left in halftime  




 I still think Cam has the job.  But DA is looking good though.  




 Doug Martin (knee) questionable to return 




 Looked like Glennon last year with his "Pass" 




 INTERCEPTION!!!! AHHHHH 




 SACKK 




 Ryan Kalil (shoulder) is probable to return.

 Wonder if DWill will have a big day, with everything he's gone through lately 




 Nice to see the opening kick of the SF/Dal game.....weirdly 




 Gotta think a ATL W is better than an NO win, for the division.   




 Falcons just recovered the ball in OT 




 Don't MAKE the Panthers break out the God of Joe Webb!

 Counterpoint: Ted Stevens who was a United States Senator from Alaska, whose tenure extended from December 24, 1968, until January 3, 2009.  

He is the internet is "not a big truck," but a "series of tubes" that could be clogged with information.

Stevens also confused the terms Internet and e-mail. 

He was also the Chairmen of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which oversees internet regulation.

 Florida will pay Idaho full $975,000 to Idaho   schools agree to play at UF in 2017 




 Confimed by AP tweet: https://twitter.com/AP/status/507257950868885504 









 There is a big chance none of these schools will be good in 5 years, whereas P5 schools will at the very least still have a lot of fans who will travel. 

Look who is talking, Ole Miss.  Y'all seem to be no more than two years removed from a .500 season.  

And JUST because a team is P5 doesn't mean they have fans.  Try to get Wake Forest, Boston College, Illinois etc. fans to their own stadium, much less an opponents.  

What I am saying is dividing current P5/G5 teams as of now is lazy way to do it.  There are too many teams that should switch places.  




 Here is the [graph](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--M_lIbYpJ--/198a5kw6182bupng.png) of the New York Times "4th down, should you go for it" bot.

 It didn't brea........ooooo 




 Maybe more evidence of a G5/P5 pure split?  Or does Mizzou need more home (money) games? 














 Per two sources, Wes Welker's positive test came in May. 




 At least he'll have plenty of time to recover from his latest concussion...... 




 You should've kicked their ass and you didn't. Period.  Yet you got rewarded for the sloppy W.

If true, Home Depot breach could be much larger than Target (40M cards stolen over 3 weeks)

 Not only that, but assuming every US HD store is breached:

* **[Target](http://pressroom.target.com/corporate):** 1,795 stores
* **[Home Depot](http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=HD.N):**  2,256 stores 




 According to him, it is the same group that did Target, Sally Beauty and P.F. Changs.  So...short vaca? 




 He tweeted it and thats is when I found out about it.

 Those seem to be the ones with the URL either on the picture or in the intro section.  




 I thought I read somewhere where people were creating fake FB accounts, so Tinder didn't pair up with FB.  But they didn't get any swipes, it just idled.  But maybe not.  




 They're evolving?!  Shiiittt 




 AFAIK the only 'thing' you need to get Tinder is Facebook with 50+ friends.  

So I assume they outsource to Asia/Eastern Europe some 12 year old to create a bunch of fake accounts, making them friends in the process (to get over the 50 friend threshold).  Then I am sure they is a way to spoof their location, then let the bots do their 'dirty work'.

 OP should probably say if you weren't born in the region/state, or if you root for a team outside of your region.   




 Double click (on the word)

Right click

Click "Search Google for..."

???

Profit 




 Just look and ask the more recent fans in the state/regions of Tennessee, North/South Carolina, Jacksonville, Houston etc.  There is a sizable portion that do not change loyalties, but I would assume that percentage would fall as the teams become more established.   









 I was being a sarcastic ass, haha
