 Don't give up.  Investing/trading/gambling is as much about learning how to lose money as it is learning how to make money.  The key is to not let the feat get to you and instead to continue educating yourself to make better entry/exit decisions next time.   

Learn what these terms mean:
1) stop limit order
2) short squeeze

you bought into naked long equity positions in $TSLA and $TWTR right as they hit the peak of a short squeeze.  If you had at least put in standing stop limit orders, you could have limited your loss.

When you enter a position, you can put in a standing One-Cancels-All order, in which you can post both stop limit order (in case of loss), and a limit order (for capping gain).  If one gets executed, the other is cancelled.  This way for each position you enter, you have defined exits in both directions.  Might be a good start so that you feel more in control of your investment.

Buy low, sell high.  and learn to be patient. 




 I'm a Krugman fan generally (or rather I believe Keynesian economics, when dealing with centralized government), but disagree with him here completely.  

However, now after a few days of thinking about it, I wonder if this is a bit of a feign for him.  He hasn't really mounted anything of an intelligent teardown of Bitcoin, and now he's just pulling in other friends almost as if to shield himself.  If you think about where he is professionally, it makes a lot of sense that he can't really support Bitcoin or weigh in positively until it really becomes more accepted.  He's an economist, not an entrepreneur.

But then again, what he said about the internet... 




 I traded some ARIA last week.  Was going to try and ride it from 7 to 8 but volume really died off Thursdsay/Friday so I got out at +$0.18/share.

I'd watch it this next week...not sure what to expect with New Years but I'm guessing we'll have more tax sell off Mon-Tues.  Might want to wait til Thurs/Fri or week after to dive in.  Look for increased volume and whether it can break $7.40.

I still think this stock could get to $10 in the next 2 months.  It traded around $20 pre-FDA decision, and now with the amended guidelines I've heard their target market is half of what it was.  So $10 seems like something it could reach, but I've only been following it for a couple of weeks. 




 thanks man...just found out about /r/house this past month
