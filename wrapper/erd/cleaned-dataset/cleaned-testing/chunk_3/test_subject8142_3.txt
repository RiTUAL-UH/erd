 About 8 years ago we used to have a commercial for a car place whose tag line was "If the tranny is dead, just call Fred." I always used to think it sounded like it should be a slogan for a really shady law firm, a la Saul Goodman. 




 I felt so cool back in the 5th or 6th grade when I broke into my friend's lego club account by answering his security question. Back when everyone had Harry Potter as what's your favorite book? 




 A significant portion of Indiana actually hates Notre Dame. 




 I've never seen a bad puppet episode. 




 1 tequila, 2 tequila, 3 quetila, floor.

FTFY 




 There's a lot of drinks where you won't taste the alcohol after the 4th or 5th one. 




 She did in the wishverse. And the comics. 




 Pigfarts Pigfarts, here I come. Pigfarts Pigfarts, yum yum yum. 




 Back when I was still in Civil Engineering, every other major had all these guys complaining about how there were no girls. We were at about 50/50. Apparently girls only become civil engineers. 




 And the Aarons have the most Home Run by brothers even though Tommie only had 13. In fairness they still manage to beat all 3 DiMaggio brothers though. 




 Super Saiyan Dwight. 




 And in fairness on the decommitting from Indiana thing, it was because he didn't like they way they treated his brother. 




 The last 5 minutes of Cheers was absolutely incredible. 




 What if I told you that being it wasn't all it's cracked up to be? A Children's Game: Part of ESPN's 30 for 30. 




 Your goodwill sells DVDs? Mine still only has VHS. 




 Yeah I should have clarified. That movie didn't portray what happened with Rudy well at all. But Indiana as a place was portrayed fairly accurately. Devine never would have stood for the whole giving up jerseys thing, and the players never would have thought to do it either. And the chanting was mostly joking/sarcastic. 




 My senior year of high school we had to take a fairy tale and rewrite it as film noir. We chose little bunny foo foo. The Good Fairy was a mob boss. 




 Alpha as fuck. 




 THE Ohio State. 




 A friend of mine apparently broke up with his girlfriend as an April Fools Joke. I'm still waiting to see how that went over. 




 A lot of the state is, honestly. I've spent some pretty boring days in random small towns because we didn't want to drive home between basketball games in the playoffs. Because it's always the random small towns that have gyms that hold 10,000 people. 




 I've always liked Deshaun Thomas. Disappointed his team didn't make it far enough his senior year of high school for him to end up the all time leading scorer in Indiana history. 




 Hulls is at least 5'11", and might be up to 6'. I've never stood back to back with him, but he always seemed pretty close in height with me. 




 Yeah the biggest inaccuracy I can think of are that the buildings in Rudy that are supposed to be Holy Cross are actually at Notre Dame. That and I'm not sure there's ever been a South Bend shovel slayer. Hoosiers was pretty much spot on, Breaking Away, too. 




 I thought LA was already Lob City though. 




 Land Before Time got run so far into the ground it made it all the way to China. 




 Better dead than orangered. 




 Those orangered bastards. 




 Look at how nice I am while I'm calling you a dumbo bimbo bitch. 




 Guys, what's the fourth? 




 We'll end up finishing somewhere in the upper middle of the ACC. This will give us a seed somewhere between 5 and 10. We'll then proceed to lose our first game in the tournament. 




 A good Easter for Notre Dame. 




 Isn't it always? 




 I agree. Just because someone with a suit can pull off a fedora, doesn't mean they looked better with them on. Even then, they were for function. It was just the acceptable hat to wear with a suit. 




 He definitely halved the value of the car if he's lucky. 




 For a second I thought the blue pie was drinking, but I see now your priorities were indeed correct. 




 He didn't own the Bobcats when this came out. 




 The Pope doesn't even have the power to execute priests. And if they did that'd be an even bigger set of issues I would think. 




 They're just downvoting. 




 81x7. 




 Yeah they decided to go as people in the Justice League. Local news never caught on. 




 [What this meme should be.](http://qkme.me/3tlsnc) 




 Unfortunately only about half, though. 




 This whole time I was under the impression that atheists were smarter and superior to the rest of us. 




 Some guys in my dorm did [this](http://www.abc57.com/video/Avengers-assemble-Summer-movie-season-kicks-off-150154375.html) last year. 




 It's there now. 




 Shit how many people do we send to USC? I thought it was weird even having the 1 from my grade, and I'm guessing you're not the same person. 




 The may be senile old men, but they're our senile old men. 




 I bet he's a such a "nice guy" though. It's not fair that no one wants to be with him. 




 If this is how he acts, I doubt he was having a lot of sex in high school. 




 The Dobler-Dahmer effect. 




 Isn't that basically multiple personality disorder? 




 While I was in high school our team had 2 losses to Oden and Conley, one to Gordon, and one to Hayward. I believe we also had 4 wins over the Teagues. Never got to play the Zellers.  




 Yeah Sampson got a few guys likes Gordon, but a huge issue was that for most part his guys weren't serious about basketball. He was essentially running a program like Blue Mountain State. The only guys who weren't getting stoned and drunk all the time his last year were Gordon and White, which is part of the reason neither came back. And why a lot of the guys in state weren't considering it.

Side note, posts like these just remind me of how much talent the state produces. I think half my high school's losses while I was there were to nba lottery picks. 




 I still wonder how different things would be if the whole O'Leary lying thing hadn't happened and we managed to hire him. 




 Hulls wasn't even going to consider IU when Sampson was there. And he hasn't known anything but IU for pretty much his whole life. 




 At least they still have Bob Davie. 




 In fairness, Wooden went to Purdue. That said I have nothing but respect for UCLA and our mutual hatred of USC. 




 I'm not sure there was ever an age where it was acceptable to wear rip off pants to a dance. Or anywhere besides athletics. 




 I see what you're doing here Chevy. /r/HailCorporate No more of your clever advertising. 




 I don't know that I remember a time where my bedtime was that early. 




 I had a friend with long blonde hair. When he went to bars guys would come up to him and ask if they could buy him a drink. He would just turn around and say sure. 




 I love the kid having the phone conversation in the background. 




 Yeah this definitely made the aim buddy info rounds. Because what 13 year old doesn't think this is hilarious? 




 Maybe she was just orgasming over his incredible guitar playing. 




 Leave your door open. That's how you meet people. 




 I say it because my 4th grade teacher drilled it into our heads. 




 /r/stopgirl So simple. So great. 




 Still only allowed if you don't get her off before you finish. Source: Catholic school. 




 The fact that he had crushes on that many girls clearly means he didn't date much in high school. As does him deciding this was a good idea. 




 As long as he was making shit up, I half expected him to get invited back for a threesome. 




 M'LADY 




 The Monstars. 




 I hope this account comes back in 9 months. 




 I plan to start saying this now. 




 I bet he skipped leg day. 




 Hell I actually confronted one. We'd dated for a month or so earlier then gone back to being friends. Then she started acting like she had feelings for me again a few months later. Finally after about a month of that I confronted her about it and called her out on it. We ended up dating for a few years after that. 




 I believe they returned 2.2 ppg his first year. 1.8 from Taber and 0.4 from some other walk on. 




 I'm just jealous that those are the lows. I'd take them as the highs. 




 I always like to ask people who talk about Lynyrd Skynyrd to name 3 songs by them. A lot of them can't. 




 When I used to work at KMart we had someone try to return an open box of condoms. He was told we couldn't give him his money for an opened box. His response: "How else was I supposed to know if they fit if I didn't try one on?" He got his money back right away so that he would go away. 




 I choose to believe somewhere out there there's people who like those bizarre sex moves. 




 Thug means never having to say you're sorry. 




 Except it would flood the market. you have to ration them out. Like diamonds. 




 This is also before UCLA was the UCLA it is now. Minnesota is much closer to the Minnesota of the 40s, without the benefit of a strong football team. 




 Also Puff lives by the sea. I'm not sure he'd want to leave that weather for Minnesota. For Santa it's practically tropical though. 




 Good job getting Tyrone to dress up like Luigi. 




 Or you can text them then offer $100 when they say they're waiting until marriage. 




 And yet he's still half hover handing. 




 They are always right. 




 Mine has Duke over Miami in the finals, with Arizona and Florida in my final four. The coin knows all apparently. 




 Well it's not like Luke had good options for leaving. 




 We don't even own that, we sold it to some Europeans. 




 I don't have class for about 9 hours. 




 Sociopath Steve? 




 Ask some females what they think of fedoras. 




 Hey now, don't forget the short sleeve button ups with flames. 




 Well not necessarily that good. I more just meant guys who weren't talented enough in high school but had the grades but went juco to try to get into a better program. I'm ok with taking jucos who went that route because of talent, just not grades. 




 I have those scissors! 




 DAE remember 2005? Only real 90s kids get this.
