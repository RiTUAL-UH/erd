 Yes, it would 




 All of the stupid has been posted/sticky'd by AMGTD and slayer before he left 




 I was assuming only official stuff could be stickied 




 It was just in the other room and I had to be sure lol  




 It's not official subreddit business and you can't ban someone for spoiling a stupid movie 




 I really like those pants. I think it's interesting because it incorporates the idea of camouflage with a modern twist, opposed to just wearing regular M81 BDU pants.

 Dude what treadmill? I have the same exact bottle too 




 This is fucking stupid and you should unsticky this 









 Oh definitely, I've always wanted a SCAR 




 For some reason you just look like that gun just suits you.  




 Oh, that'd explain the detail and such. Good idea to implement model painting with airsoft 














 The second Hyouka OP is really catchy. The first one is great but it's not something I can listen to casually like a catchy song.  




 You are *exactly* like him lol 




 Yeah it's great 




 I'm ready for a feels trip 




 But I have to watch Shingatsu wa Kimi no Uso now lol 




 Wait I didn't mean to ask anything, oops lol. Also, now that you mention it looking back the whole mood and background of the show got increasingly more colorful as the show progressed.  




 I'll just share my quick interpretation quick I guess. 

Houtarou mentions throughout the entire series the rose colored high school life and through the whole series he grows into this role. Do you think that final scene with the cherry blossoms and shit was foreshadowed by all of that or a finalization of his transformation? 




 All in all it was fucking great except for the confusing end. Thanks based batcrains for suggestion  




 My dad got his nipples pierced at Rock Fest in 2009 or so. Still has em' pierced. 




 Very nice job on the paint. It all seems very thorough and smooth with no terrible drips.  




 Damn, what's that first mod? It's so sleek. 




 Little late, but I didn't feel like posting link since it's not too unique. A step up from my old set up.

 Ohhhh. People should join the Skype chat 




 Well, to Elucidate means to clear up or explain so "Elucidator" means to explain or clear?  




 What chat? 




 Just the way you worded that didn't make sense. You probably meant something along the lines of "Airsofting makes you sweat, and you will sweat hard." 

What you said is just repeating the same thing twice with more or less the same sentiment.  




 Magazines. Always make sure to have the right amount of magazines. 




 He'll sweat and ***and*** he will? Wow.

 Contractors and mercs don't wear military camouflage.  




 Whoa, how did you do that to the Masada. I don't know why, but that looks like something I'd want to do. Any better pictures? 




 I feel like I'm one of the only people actually excited about this game. All of my friends are "DAE PC MASTER RACE GUISE COD SUCKS" but I think it looks cool 




 What gun is it? 




 Wow, most speedsofters come off as douchey and annoying. I'm glad you posted this and this really changed my opinion to say the least. You're a respectable dude. 




 Vignettes are nice in moderation. This one is a little overpowering, but a great picture nonetheless.  




 Must be why the camera quality is so terrible 




 Post things like this to /r/airsoft 




 Well then he needs to post to /r/airsoft 




 Not really unique or special, but a nice piece nonetheless  




 I'm pretty sure he's joking, otherwise this post would be re-directed to /r/airsoft.

 My mom does already and thinks tanning helps 




 For some reason my parents have taken a liking to tanning beds because they want "more vitamin D" and when I crawled up from my cave to get some coffee they suggested I go with them.

Well suggesting turned into saying I don't get enough sun even though winter just got over here. I like my cave. I don't want skin canxer.  




 I'm gonna attempt to watch the first season, but there's so much it makes me uncomfortable. Just, every chance they get they put butts in. 




 Wow. It takes something else to make a video with so much emotion and beauty with such content. 




 Oh yeah, of course 




 That looks like a fun sniper just to have around.  




 Ha, yeah

 Not really, it was just a lot of butts. Plus, it was made in 2007 




 Literally every action scene zoomed in on their crotches and butts and there's a lot of fan service. I thought Upotte was bad.

 This is something that happened to me awhile ago when I was 11. I figured writing it somewhere would help me feel better-ish. I'm just going to type it how it's written in my little manifesto of mine.

Back in 2009, or 2008? I can't remember the year but it was awhile ago. I'm 17 and it happened when I was 11 for reference. When I was younger I took a grand trip to Canada, Alaska, and Seattle with my grandparents and my cousin. The cruise started from port in West Seattle (like by the Space Needle-ish and the cool stuff.) 

When we arrived in Seattle we decided to stay at a hotel for three days to visit the Dry Soda Company (I saw it on Food Network and was curious) the Space Needle, and, regretfully, the famous Pikes Place Market. Well, not regretfully as in going there was bad, but the market is a dark place in my mind because of my experience. 

We explored the lights and sounds, and shopped the first day. That was amazing. Seattle was, and is, a beautiful city with beautiful sights. Well, the "supreme travel itinerary" as my grandma dubbed it, was that we'd go to the Pikes Place market on the second day. Now, I don't know how it looks now, but when I visited there were a lot of homeless people. My grandparents told me not to pay any mind to them and to ignore them. This made me sad. A blemish of sorts, but it didn't deter me from the whole face of Seattle.

I remember that whole morning as vivid as yesterday. I woke up, ignored the not-so-inviting continental breakfast and waited for my grandparents to finish. Hell, I even remember playing Yoshi's Island DS on my DS Lite. Well, they were always cheap.

They finished up and we were off. As soon as we left the entrance we were greeted by a young women. She was obviously homeless by the tattered clothes and McDonalds cup with loose change in it. She smelled like pot and paint thinner. She looked hungry and distraught. Her haggard frame didn't take away from her still young looking face. She seemed to be in her late 20's or early 30's from what I recall.

Anyways, I remember reaching for my pokemon themed wallet with the intent to give her change. As I went to rummage for a penny or two my grandpa scolded me and snatched the wallet from my hands. "No test_subject8195" he said, "There's a reason she's like that."

"There's a reason she's like that."

That stuck with me. It still sticks with me. Here was this human being reduced to the status of a stray dog, and he said that. I remember sighing, still shocked at his demeanor, and trailing behind them. I remember seeing a young gentlemen, probably a concierge or a bag boy, chase her off. "Oh well." I remember thinking. 

Fast forward through a sea of cardboard pleas, winos, and street performers and we reached our destination. Pikes Place Market. I remember splitting off from my grandparents and cousin while watching a young gentlemen toss a fish around and do other tricks. After he was finished I clapped, and turned around. 

Gone. My grandparents were nowhere to be found and I was caught in a sea of fish smell, patrons, and the sinking feeling that I was inevitably fucked. I scrambled through the crowd to no avail. The thick smog of bodies clouded my view, and my calls for help went unanswered. After breaking through the crowd I found a back alley. Scared, confused, and hoping for a break from the hustle and bustle I walked through the alley. 

Torn flyers, waste bins, and other arrangements of junk littered the passage. Then I heard it. The sound that haunts my dreams and my mind when it wanders.

Gurgling. A low mumbling gurgle laced with coughs and the unmistakable sound of struggling. It sounded rather odd, but my adventurous 11 year old brain led me to the source. Oh how I wish it didn't. How I wish I would have just sauntered off or turned around.

I walked over to a tipped over trashcan, and a dumpster. I didn't know what to expect, but it wasn't like the movies. It wasn't slow, but it was silent. Save for the god awful gurgling and struggling. I even remember the picture on what I now assume was a craft beer bottle strewn along with the forgotten waste. There was a rabbit with a shit eating grin on its face giving a thumbs up. Soon after seeing that my eyes led me to the source of the sounds. 

It was a kneeling yet slumped, convulsing pile. Then she looked up. It was the homeless woman from earlier. I stumbled back and recoiled in fear. "She must have knocked over the trash can and hurt herself" I thought. The thought seems innocent now, and I wish it would have been the case.

Her tattered black hoodie was caked in what appeared to be vomit and bodily fluids. It was still fresh because I remember the smell overwhelming me. Then I saw it, there was a needle jutting out of her arm. At the time I couldn't comprehend what it was, or why the woman was acting so strange. It's that innocence I wish I could still possess. 

But no, this woman was overdosing. She was dying. In front of my eyes, this woman was dying and I couldn't do jack shit to save her. I was a kid, and I was afraid. 

She looked up at me and her lips seemed to try to form words, but nothing happened.  Merely shaking and more trembling before she fell and slumped even further on to the grimey alley ground. The look still haunts me, it still causes me to have panic attacks or throw up if I picture it well enough. The best way I can explain it without forcing myself to think too much about it, is milk with a little blue dye in it. That's what her skin looked like.

She feebly reached out at my pant leg. I stepped back more, and then she slumped over. I wasn't sure if she was dead, but I nudged her with my foot. She didn't move. She was dead, she had to be. 

I screamed. I screamed louder than I ever will in my life. I ran after that, probably the fastest I'd ever run too. I ran back the way I came, past the stupid fucking rabbit bottle, past the flyers, past the market area where I was before. I only stopped when I reached the gift shop area.

I cried. I cried more than I ever will I think. I never cared for my grandparents, let alone any of my relatives, but I was elated to find them browsing the selection of shirts. They were wondering why I was crying.  I eluded to the fact that I watched a woman die, and rather just told them I was hysterical because I was lost. I still wish that was the case looking back. 

I feel, like a part of me died when that woman died. I feel like watching anybody die an untimely and violent death would kill something inside of anybody. Seattle was, and is, a beautiful city with beautiful sights. 

I am never going back there though. I'm going to leave whatever part of me died there. That's the way it's meant to be.

 Vorpie save us from debt. Pls. Debt. Too strong.  




 Put off watching Cowboy Bebop for far too long because so many other shows seemed more appealing. I thought, "Oh old show, so it must be drawn old and gross." 

After listening to some of the soundtrack and a friend bugging me to watch it too much, I fired up Deluge and torrented that mother. Two words. Holy shit.

The whole story was amazing, the animation and art style was **leagues** ahead of the time. For 1998 it's a really pretty show. That coupled with the great soundtrack and story bumped it up into my top five.

If you've been putting off watching this show or feel iffy about it, watch it. 9/11 would watch again. 



















 Holy fuck more Steins;Gate anime on the way, also I just read the Epigraph shit and I'm shitting my pants.  




 Just the question above I guess. I've watched everything I can and I want to prepare myself for Steins;Gate Zero so I thought this would be my best course of action

Edit: Found them online and read them all, holy fuck 














 Man, probably the second worst case of post anime watching bummer feels I've had. Overall probably my new favorite slice of life with Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo in a close second. I just feel like it ended more completed with more material that hasn't been made into anime that isn't crap. 10/10 would recommend.  

Edit: Exclamation points are part of show title, I don't type with that much emotion 



















 I sat in the empty desk in front. I don't like being this far up in the row. 

Edit: Pretty sure she saw the title of this post since it's in bold blue lettering. I'm autistic.  




 Okay guys, finished up the patch, used the colors I was told to, and touched up all of the parts that were too detailed. 

[Here it is] (http://i.imgur.com/KkUDwVR.png)

Thoughts, concerns, things, memes?  
[DISCUSS] (http://i.imgur.com/QwWVIf9.gif) 














 Genuine question here since people are naturally social creatures and women need men to reproduce? 




 Okay so after some discussion and shit in the mod chat I've made [this revised patch idea.] (http://i.imgur.com/fDVxD2i.png)

Other options I'm considering is making the coat of arms thing red again but let's see how the blue works for you guys. Discuss and shit. I don't know about any of the financial stuff. 



 









 So I recently posted here asking for somebody to vectorize something, [this image in question.] (http://i.imgur.com/N89cDnO.png) and I need another quick favor. I've tried using threshold stuff and doing some of the things you guys reccomended but I just couldn't get the same effect as the picture above. 

If someone here could vectorize [this] (http://i.imgur.com/7ggq37x.jpg) image that would be awesome. Thanks! 




 After a somewhat busy past week, sketchy promises, browsing dank memes, and trying to erase a piece of the patch for about ten minutes after realizing it was food on the screen, I finished the patch idear for the official /r/a_irsoft patch. 

Here's a little album, http://imgur.com/a/x6LBh

The font choice was the hardest thing so if there are any other ideas speak up and I'll throw it together. Otherwise I need thoughts, opinions, what to fix, and other stuff. 
 




 Can somebody vectorize [this] (http://i.imgur.com/TqCAU8e.png) image for me? 

Similar to [this] (http://crissia.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/jack.jpg) or [this?] (http://www.vectors4all.net/preview/chigevara-face-free-vector.jpg) 









 This is kind of hard to explain, but when I airsoft I feel like a different person. When I started airsoft obviously [I had really bad gear and bad guns] (http://i.imgur.com/nmtS8ZN.jpg) and I thought, "I'm going to get better and get better gear." Ever since the days of plinking around with friends with our springers and LPEG's between jam sessions I knew airsoft was a different hobby. 

When I airsoft I feel stronger, and I feel like buying more gear makes airsoft me stronger. It's weird.  









 The sticky post on top of the sub has been too tantalizing for me and I'm ready to throw a design together and help get these patches made, so let's talk about it. Where/how are they going to be made and who do I give the design to? Are we gonna make this happen? 

If so, I'm making it after work tonight and I'll post up the design once I'm done. 

Edit: Home from work and going to begin work once I brew me up some coffee and get brainstorming.  




 That is all. Continue.  




 It only made redditing and browsing dank memes easier though.
