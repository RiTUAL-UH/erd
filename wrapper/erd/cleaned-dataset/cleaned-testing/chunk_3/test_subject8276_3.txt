 Because Jim Carrey doesnt like sequels and just recently relented. 




 Paula Patton  




 Ah man im gonna miss it I actually liked it mostly for Karen.  




 Interesting very interesting I had no idea. Also know who ALbert Fish is and wow.  




 Yes hes a villain but not really if ya know wat I mean. Plus he tried to call it off too but was too late.  




 ???????  




 Yeah I kinda wish they had stayed with Evil Jigsaw in the sequels.  




 Is it just me or is Jigsaw on the original Saw a lot more cruel. In all the other movies he says he despises killing people yet Gordon is ordered to kill Adam and he also slashes Tapps throat. Its like he is much more of a psychopath in that one and all the others he seems like a vigilante.  




 Because he had money problems.  




 Okay cool thanks 




 I have always wondered.  




 OMG YES!!!!!!!!!  




 When is this movie coming out damit!!!!!  




 that would give me nightmares  




 maybe  




 Because they were just a waste it seemed like.  




 I will force it out of you. Okay so heres how it goes I understand that you gave birth to me and you care for me but dont freakin talk to me like you understand my life alright. Your such a freaking hypocrite also. I HATE when you drink it makes you into an obnoxious bitch I cant wait to get out of here and i will NEVER call you when I leave for the last time. Oh yeah one more thing when I give my opinion to you you tell me to leave but you have the right to tell me yours all the freaking time?? That makes no sense like at all.  




 My apologies  




 Now thats a working man.  




 I think you know  




 Thanks yeah she was I miss her so much now.  




 Do you just live to annoy me in the most subtle way??? Why is it you always do things that annoy me so much. Like when I want to be alone you come in and steal my solitude from me. Also you never do what is expected of you.  




 She died the other day I miss her so much already my beautiful Daisy I will miss taking her for walks.  




 They will hand it to some one who will be a puppet basically.  




 Jesus you watch The two Hobbit movies all the dam time its like the only movies you watch!!!! Why are you so obsessed with them??? This year alone you must have seen them both 5 times each whats so special about them?? I mean I like Hobbit and LOTR too but not that much. You always complain when you say I rewatch movies but your worse then me you freakin idiot.  




 That has happened to me 3 times for Dont be afraid of the dark, the raid 2, and recently Tusk. It is an awesome experience!!!!! U can text and switch seats as many times as u want to. When I saw The Raid 2 I sat in like 10 different seats.  




 Yeah its just too much.  




 Isnt it annoying when they announce a date for a movie trailer?? I mean we have already been waiting for some footage for months possibly even years dont make us wait longer just release the dam thing.  




 Yeah but probably not.  




 I always get there at least 15 minutes before the movie starts if its a new movie I get there earlier tho. I cannot watch a movie in the theater without a snack so I always get a popcorn and soda depending on the length sometimes candy too. I always sit in the middle so i dont have to crane my head or not. I ALWAYS put seasoning in my popcorn i have been for 3 years now let me think Caramel, Kettle Corn, and Ranch. I dont really eat or drink the snacks during the previews because I like to save it for the movie. I normally go to Harkins Theaters a local chain but sometimes I will go to AMC for a 5 dollar movie. Sometimes I go to a dollar theater too they have a special every tuesday movies for 1.50. Anyways those r my habits.    




 dam stupid marvel  




 His wife has only been in his movies I believe. She basically has no career except in his movies.  




 Yes those are the main 3.

 $7 exactly sometimes 7.50 depending on the chain I go to, I usually always get in at matinee price during the evening because I have a student ID.  




 The Catcher in The Rye dam JD and his family so stubborn.

 Unless its still playing in some theaters then u will have to wait til late november when some torrents hit.  




 All Halloween movies, All Friday the 13th movies, and all Nightmare on Elm Street movies.  




 I just realized that John Wick was released yesterday the same day that the show Constantine premiered on NBC. is that weird???  




 "When I arrive at my destination I am gonna Kill Bill"  




 Its the only time someone actually says Star Trek in Star Trek

So annoying everytime I watch Modern Family you comment about Cam and Mitch its getting fucking old!!!! Im slowly starting to think you are in the closet like that guy on American Beauty.

 Yes you are.  




 Man I wish I can erase my mind and watch that movie again for the first time i was so blown away when I finally saw it.  




 aha sure  




 Harry Potter survived in Deathly Hallows because of the piece of Voldemort inside him he survived because he became the master of the Deathly Hallows.  




 Jack Nicholson and Quentin Tarantino  




 If its already filming why not release it next year?? It is a directtodvd and those dont cost too much.  




 Nice musical scene  




 Its just a limited release in the next few weeks it will get more.   




 OMG I hate the dam news you watch it every dam night!!!!! Sometimes multiple times a day and they just replay the same stories over and over!!!! When you miss just one of them you get annoyed well who cares. When I get my own place I will NEVER watch the news and when you visit and ask to watch it I will not let you!!!!!! I dont know why you are obsessed with that stupid show anyways.  




 What r some??  




 Cant wait to see wat they do to Juice.  




 Yeah im surprised he didnt tell Nero or Alvarez the man really wants to die.  




 Yes  




 Just say that he wasnt actually Spiderman by that time.  




 K I will probably just get new ones tho  




 They didnt really show him its weird. Would have loved to see him.  




 okay cool  




 So I was listening to my headphones today and the left side all of a sudden stopped working. I messed around with it a little bit but then I had to position the cord into a certain position just to hear it out of both sides. I dont want to get rid of them but what is wrong with them?? Can they be fixed cheaply??  




 LOL thanks  




 Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder  




 Oh god yes!!!!!  




 Yes just have them make the amazing spiderman movies intigrated into the mcu.  




 It came out in March  




 Like the shortest amount of time that a trailer was released between the film itself?? Was there ever one that was weeks before a movie opened??  




 The one where Lucille tells George Michael that Maebe "spent her inheritence getting here". I laughed when I first heard that scene.  









 Yeah so that means season 4 of Arrow will be Oliver in prison.  




 Yeah.................................yeah.  




 Thomas Jane  




 I think I found my new job LOL  




 Awesome thank you!!!!!!  




 Okay well thats not right  




 Yeah noone major wants to work with him its a shame cuz he is such a good actor.  




 Its sad that most of the former james bonds arent that big anymore.  




 HAHAH I remember that episode  




 OMFG dude wow!!!!!  




 He didnt like being a star so he only does smaller stuff nowadays.  




 Yeah shes nothing nowadays man she used to be the queen of the world.  




 He still makes stuff he had a few movies this last year.  




 Okay cool  




 o okay alright thanks love reacher  




 I mean there is an arc or something that follows a story 61 hours and worth dying for it says they have a story or something.  




 YES!!!!!!!  




 So I just got back from the library and the only reacher novel they had is A Wanted Man I looked it up and it said it is part of another storyline. Do I need to read the other books 61 hours and worth dying for in order to understand this one?? Id hate to have to take it back.  




 I think he just made a shit ton of money that he didnt think he could work again except for Rush Hour but I did like him in Silver Linings Playbook.  




 He says he is semi retired but he hasnt done a movie for like 4 years so lets just say he is retired.  




 He burned a lot of bridges and stuff and noone wants to work with him anymore. I dont think his career an be saved.  




 Joffrey and then Cersei.
