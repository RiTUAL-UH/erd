 I think if you register your modem via my.netgear.com, it'll provide this information. If not then email customer.service@netgear.com requesting ownership information. They should be able to tell you who purchased the modem - if it was a cable company it'll have their company name since they purchase directly from Netgear.   




 Same thing happend to me. Only way I was able to settle this was to show PROOF of ownership by looking up my modem s/n via the manufacturer website. Actually, proof that Comcast didn't purchase it. For Arris/Motorola/General Instruments, you can provide proof of ownership via:
