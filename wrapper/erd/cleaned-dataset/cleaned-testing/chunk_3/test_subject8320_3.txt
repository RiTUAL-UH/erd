 YOOOOOOO!!!! I need more pat samples [Post them here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/2tslr7/dose_anyone_have_any_audio_clips_of_pat_they/) 









 yes... 




 Someone bug ultra pancake on twitter to make this happen NAO!! 




 I'm working on a song and all it needs is an angry leprechaun  









 Frenchcore is a genre, it's known for its punchy synthetic kicks 




 Hmmm, I get what your saying I kind of feel the same way about hands-up, plus this isn't the best example of a Frenchcore kick. [Heres a better example](http://youtu.be/ymzJeo-3b1I) 









 Rage is the embodiment of pure blackness and rage 




 Today class we will go over proper cunilingus edict "later during class" oops I droped my pen *gigles as she bends over to pick it up*  




 Thanks man! that was going to bug me... 




 I can't bleave I forgot it's name, it's the one where the girl puts a bag in between her legs and shakes her butt until she gets tired all while going "hado! hado! hado! hado!" 




 Sure thing! Frenchcore is known for its extremely synthetic punchy kicks [Heres a song by hellfish](http://youtu.be/EjKmr3lllsw) 




 RWC is making a Frenchcore alias the only thing is he can think of a name. So why don't we help him out! 









 F F F 3respektz5u 




 I really like Darude, his tech mix of "in the darkness" is fantastic 




 Venetian Snares, the things that man has made just blow my mind, 7/4 for life! 









 Not bad, the percussion was a little too loud, this has a lot of great ideas so just keep at it :) p.s. PM me one of your FLPs sometime it would be fun to collab with you 




 Ya pyramid head go ahead and take that pipe from Alex, he's a chode anyway 




 Occasionally you will hear a scream coming from rage's chest, when that happens rage sends out his soul to beat up the soul that screamed. 




 :O 




 Sorry :(, I feel pretty embarrassed now because I just figured out the beat grid, I was doing two notes per measure instead of 8 (I thought I was doing correctly). Sorry if I came off as a D-bag, no hard feelings? :( 




 p.s. RULES OF NATURE!!! 









 I've been doing that and I'm still not 100% happy with it and as for how it sounds [You'd be surprised](http://youtu.be/kM73tcr16Rs) 

EDIT: please don't down vote this. Everyone has a right to their own opinion but just because you don't like terrorcore doesn't mean you should down vote my post/comment   




 you might be wondering why anyone would want to go faster then 522, well that's because I'm making a terrorcore song and I want it to be 666 BPM :D, I've gone past 522 before but I cant remember how. Can someone help me out? 




 great song but not exactly what I'm looking for, come to think of it the stuff I'm looking for would probably be classified as Big Room/Main Stream house :/ any ways heres another [example](https://soundcloud.com/fiveandadime/5-a-dime-tempo-6-59-songs-in-an-hour-1) (start at 46:34) P.S. this mix actually has a lot of the kind of music I'm looking for      




 I'm looking for a certain kind of electro house. It's a little difficult to describe but I'm looking for stuff with massive build-up's and drops that focus on one crazy sound. [The best example I have is this song](http://youtu.be/UEDF_IRT9NM) 




 Sure thing :) 









 They haven't, I just posted this because the zaibatsu/people on here love Jojo :) 




 If it was the other way around it would be OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 




 You expected Summer Lovin' but it was me DIO!!! 




 [actually....](http://avielsusej.deviantart.com/art/Mordo-s-Regular-Adventure-Polnarigby-H5-Chariot-408212982) 




 Those snoop samples just add so much! 














 just look at that smile! 









 Jeasus that red head was a bitch..... 




 The game really goes to shit in the second act when you go to town. Here's a list of reasons why the town sucks: 1. Grey brown and rainy, 2. zombies that are on fire 3. Zombies with helmets 4. Zombies with BASIC weapons that can do STUPID amounts of damage (they can also throw the weapons) 5. The Ram  




 Ain't that the truth, I completed one when I was still in the hotel and went up to like level 60 but all the weapons stayed at level 1 2 




 although she dose have a lazy eye... but I have to admit that she was the LEAST hate-able character from the game     




 Ya RWC gets it right 









 No Sam B 0/10 - IGN, in all seriousness this game looks like everything dead island should have been in the first place (I sold and re-bought dead island twice and pat was super right the game just falls apart around the end) I REALLY tried to enjoy it but I just couldn't  




 Chili dogs 




 :D p.s. [heres his remix of native faith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8giKbzcxA-E)
 




 Thanks :D that means a lot coming from the based freq himself! 




 Hmmm.... IDK if you'll like this but [here's a darkcore/industrial mix I found](http://youtu.be/-soLEuEHaho) also checkout meander

 What show is it? 




 I think technically this is DnB but I don't care because this song is as happy as a rainbow milkshake  









 Its cool :)
 




 I haven't checked but I'm going to guess no, [do some searching on here](http://www.doujinstyle.com/forum/) I normaly hate torrenting but with most Japanese releases its the only way 









 Oh wow, so meany things.... But if I had to say one it would be a new appreciation for Japanese developed ps2 games  




 http://www.ppf2014.info/ found this awhile ago and I really love it  




 love this song!

 Ophidian is one of my favorites (also checkout his crossbreed alias Meander) 




 one of the more interesting trapstyle songs I have heard 









 Ha I wish, but seriously I am hyped for this! 




 I tried :( it's giving me an error now sadly I think I'll have to reinstall FL  




 :) 









 The most important thing is did you like it? 




 another one from you. This time its happy hardcore :3 




 if your looking to get into tech trance I would recommend Darude, I'm serious his rush album is great!  




 did you do the cover art for this priz? 




 dose any one know how to fix this? 




 Good: Ophidian, The Outside Agency, Nosferatu, Art of fighters, Digital punk, Massive New Krew, Radical Redemption, Meander, The Prophet, Yandere Complex and The Dark Oscillators 

Bad: Body Lotion (srsly wtf), You, Psycho 909, Tone, The Wild Motherfuckerz and The Donkey Rollers  




 Oh and for future reference, the stuff your looking for is called Happy Hardcore and/or UK Hardcore (just incase you want to find more :D) 




 I agree with you on the bass. Anyways if you like this then keep an eye on F3tch, he just released a collab with Gawtbass and he has an EP coming out on NSD:BL on the 26 









 Check out some [freeform](http://youtu.be/O2El0dpEYH0) this is a mix for a free compilation and the DL for said comp. is in the description :) 




 Woa.. I always thought it was just his website. That's awesome! 




 Since my last post did better then expected, I decided why not post some more Japanese music. This time it's Gabber :) p.s. Checkout more of Kobaryo's stuff, he is a god 









 EVE gave you a lot of good suggestions so check those guys out. The only other person I can think of that EVE didn't mention is DJ Shimamura (nanobii loves him) 




 Japanese DnB is like a milk shake. Sweet and satisfying! p.s. check out more of you's stuff, he's really good  









 But blur doesn't have a sound track by Noisia c: (I've never played blur and I'm not hating on it I just really love Noisia) 




 Ya I can definitely imagine driving down a highway to this. Sun setting as my Delorean rolls down the coast at 66MPH 




 Glad I could help :) 




 Made by me :), not asking for feed back on this just take a listen if you need to zone out for awhile    









 Oh! One last important thing, if you want to find some great music look for touhou remixes. Just search touhou schranz, hardstyle, hard trance, nu-style. Etc and your bound to find some good songs :) some of my faveorite songs being ice cheinsaw by moro nuclear blast by siromaru and bad apple by Shingo Dj 




 Words to live by  




 ooohhh.... name your price :) 




  Hello everyone, I was just looking at the reddit comments for the drift stage video and I noticed that some of you seem to like retro/80's synth music. So please; sit down, make yourself comfortable, pop a boner and let's circlejerk about some music! :)

*unzips pants* I'll start, I'm absolutely in love with the hotline Miami sound track, all the songs just fit so well, their psychedelic but still danceable. As for artist I love Mitch Murder if you don't know who he is then let me tell you why you should love him, 4 words: [He remixed Guiles theme](https://soundcloud.com/daataa/mitch-murder-guiles-theme) 




 Motherfuckers act like they don't know about [Mitch Murder](http://youtu.be/hugowO0sSrM)

P.S. If your still not convinced [heres](https://soundcloud.com/daataa/mitch-murder-guiles-theme) his remix of guiles theme 









 Oh massive circleZ isn't an artist, their compilation albums released by massive new krew, so far their have been 4 




 Sure thing :)

Edit: actually I don't know a lot of Japanese Hardstyle artists either :/ The two consistent artists I know of are Shingo Dj and Massive New Krew, again the thing I noticed is most artists produce all kinds of hard dance, not just Hardstyle 




 Fuck ya! Japanese hardstyle! 




 I look at who some of my fav artists are following on soundcloud 




 Heck yes 3 love roughsketch 




 Maybe an artists logo is hidden in the pic? 




 [Japanese stream hardcore 4 album preview](http://youtu.be/IZRvaeJUKjw) my favorite song from this album is clock control by Kobaryo, the melody is spot on 

[Massive Circlez 2 cross fade demo](http://youtu.be/IZRvaeJUKjw) all the Massive Circlez compilations are gold, most Japanese producers make all kinds of hard dance but the massive new krew consistantaly make Hardstyle so check them out

As for buying these... Well most Japanese releases I've seen are physical copy only and they are only available from various Japanese websites (so unless you speak Japanese or your browser translates it for you, you might have a hard time finding out if the CD's are still in stock / if they ship outside of Japan). the Japanese stream hardcore comps. Are on iTunes as for the Massive Circlez you might have to result to torrenting. I can PM you the torrent file if need be 




 It doesn't matter where their from :) let me rephrase my question "what is your favorite hardstyle producing country?" (Go indeapth about it, I like the food, the culture, the kicks. Etc) I should have clarified that, sorry :( 




 Japan FTW!!!

EDIT: I really like Japanese Hardstyle   Hardcore because their kicks sound a lot diffrent from most Italian / Dutch Hardstyle   Hardcore. Plus anime samples sound really cool if used well  




 You can find some defqon and q dance related stickers kicking around online (along with other events/festivals) I don't have any links for those sorry :( but if your into hardcore I do have a link to the MOH [store](http://store.mastersofhardcore.com/moh-car-sticker) 




 Woa man, forget music in your blood, its in your DNA, it's part of your biological code (I guess that's why you guys were called bioweapon huehuehue) 




 Ever wonder how pat stays so short and angry? Well now you know, pure 100% Irish piss  




 You can't imagine how much fun were having by atmosphere. Slug is a poet personal fav from the album being "say hey their" also check out their song "god loves ugly" 









 all while the Joestars cheer rage on for fear of being curb stomped  




 OMG! THE JOESTAR MEN v.s RAGE v.s DIIIOOOO!! 




 More like 1/4 of a man 1/2 of a man and a full pie theif 




 Let's get to know each other alittle better :) you don't need to say a lot about yourself if you don't want to so one little fact is all I ask.

My name is Ethan and I love mass effect! Biotic for life! (But you probably knew that I loved ME) 

Anyways I love all things hard (hard as in hard dance... I saw your mind in the gutter there) but seriously Hard house, hard trance, hardstyle, hardcore. Etc, I love everything about it especially hard trance (speaking of which if your into listening to music and gaming Hard trance+ME=bliss)  




 True that :) 




 Interesting.... Mind elaborating? 	(      )	
 




 For me it would have to be Seth Green. I would love to pick his brain a bit (also their should really be a ME robot chicken skit) 




 THIS SOUNDS LIKE A CONVERSATION THAT WOULD BE IN JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE!!!  




 sorry if these kind of posts are looked down on. if you want a good laugh I highly recommend checking out the rest of the page I got this from   









 I guess if your really, and I mean reeeaaaallllyyyy into being choked you would be happy 









 I'm still waiting on plague to draw some fan art of the lizard girls :T 




 Disclaimer!!!!!!: I did not make this! All credit goes to "NotAnAnimator" I saw how little views this video had and saw that it hadn't been posted here yet so I decided why not post it and help it get more views :) (sorry for any confusion) 









 Keep in mind this is a radio rip. So it could get better 









 In this off beat adventure set way up north in Canada a solider who is not well liked by his unit and a AI who wants nothing more then to destroy all of humanity fall in love and decide to run off across the small 30 mile island all while being pursued by the incompetent unit commander, the smoker, mutants with shotguns on their arms and the creators of the AI who know she's good deep down. Can our young lovers keep their gear from degrading? Will the solider ever put a point into psi powers so he can finally use kinetic redirection? Will the AI ever stop making fun of humans and their shitty skin and organs? I don't know maybe.... Ya maybe. Find out if your questions will ever be answered on April 11th, 1999 all while listening to a sound track that's made up of orchestral music and 1999 DnB and trance with lazy flanging to make it more trancy! 




 If I ever decide to have a fallout party I would like a sound track to match :) the only two songs I know of currently are [Paradise Falls by Geck-e](http://youtu.be/3VO6NBZNNAI) and [War never changes by Psycho 909](http://youtu.be/Ox9OvRvXebQ) 




 *Shodan procides to project a full body video feed in your cyber interface, as you ogle her sexy, luscious robo body you fail to notice a hybrid behind you. He procides to cave your skull in with a pipe and steal your cyber interface so the entire flesh can enjoy the fruits of their "mothers" body. You did not survive the adventure." (BTW in wrighting this I realize that people will probably think I have a thing for Shodan. I assure you I do not, I mean seriously have you seen her face? She is the definition of a butter face) 




 And a little stuffed vault boy  




 I think the closets were going to get to quantum is MTN Dew volt. Plus nuka cola doesn't help you acheve euphoria (I'm on /r/montageparodies a lot) although it would be cool to have a soda that doubles as a glow stick
