 Yeah well, ours is better, take that! 




 Adderall IS amphetamine.  




 What is the right measurement of laughter? 




 Why do people say it gets better? How can life get better when your future is ruined by an illness inside of your brain? I actually have 2-3 of those illnesses inside my brain. My future is gone, why should I continue and just suffer all the way through it, why can't I be mercy killed, peacefully? I know I may not be terminally ill, but I am chronically ill that makes me wish I was terminally ill just so my suffering would end. How can it get better, when it's already destroyed?  




 CS  Heroin. 




 Looks like super high sens or super high accel, either way, turn that shit down.  




 Every time I watch a pasha stream I want to play again... Then I realize I'm not pasha.  




 Vicodin wont make you spout stupid shit. This guy is just fucked up... Or *trolling*. 




 Oh.. My.. God... THAT'S why there's always smoke there... God dammit. 




 Anti-Psychotics slow down or stop your metabolism all together. I don't get appetite increase that much, maybe I eat a 100 or so more calories than a normal person. 

There is also no way that someone that used to NEVER put on weight put on 80-90 pounds in 11-12 months. It's not possible without eating at McDonalds everyday, every night and every midnight. 

When you say "meds don't cause weight gain"... Steroids do and so do Anti Psychotics...

[here's the evidence, found on the Quetiapine wiki](http://gyazo.com/b363db4cfe0c7a5bd501eb8b1870eff5) 




 Even though I've got somewhat "clinically" better, I now don't see the point in continuing this life. I've lost most of my education (I was a very smart/good student), I've gained about 85-90 pounds in a fucking year from this medication and I don't even eat a lot, I eat normally. I could've went back to my school yesterday, but because I'm so overweight I can't bear the reactions I would get, I don't feel good at all. I have chronic pain as well, and it's undiagnosed because no one cares to help me. 

What can I really do in society? I'm nothing, I can't even function when I'm "better".   




 Jesus gives you morals and the bible is the most moral book in history... /s 




 Gold Nova 3-4 is a lot different from a silver. I've personally never been in silver longer than a day or so though.  




 I hate it when people do things like this. I also hate it when someone rages because they don't do good one game but when they do great the next game (better than you) they say, "I'm so bad", in a snarky, passive aggressive way (I'm not talking about random's here).  




 Yeah, I think I just didn't make it clear enough like you did.  




 "And fentanyl isn't dangerous"... Then he deserves to go shoot up 5mg.  




 Are you 100% sure about that? 




 I think it causes people to focus on it too much and get upset when they rank a little lower. It also causes "elitism" among players. I myself don't like it but at the same time I do like it. I just don't like how it lowers my rank even though I carry my team but we still loose.  




 That depends on height, type of girl etc.  




 I could eat all of these 10x over.  




 What about Opiates? 




 Sure. 




 Every pistol round is a panic.  




 Yet when you hear an accent like mine (Scottish) I bet you get mad because you can't understand me. I don't blame you though, I can hardly understand myself.  




 I usually have a lesser appetite. The only "drug" that's gave me hardcore munchies was a lot of weed. 




 What? How is that weird? Your classmates seem immature.

 




 But what if he thought that giving her this gift would get him at least a date? 




 Leading people on is NOT fair, at all. Just don't accept gifts if you know that this will potentially lead him to believe that there is a chance of dating you.  




 Yep, I agree totally.  




 Wait, what? How do you not know what any of these are... Common knowledge I thought.  




 She seems kinda annoying and bitchy. Don't buy expensive shit for girls when they'll just friend zone you harder and harder.  









 Sorry for not posting anything in the text box... Updated. 




 I wouldn't jump to schizophrenia just yet... 




 Do they not test for fentanyl and fentanyl analogues?  




 Glad you're not another statistic. Always test your shit before you do it. It was most likely fentanyl, fucking retarded cut if you ask me, but whatcha gonna do when the government illegalizes drugs and makes them unsafe?

Again, glad you're okay. 




 Sorry I didn't put anything here, I didn't know exactly what to put. I asked this question because I started LISTENING to William Burroughs read the book and got quite hooked, still haven't finished it though as it's 3 hours long... Gonna listen on and off, seems really good. 

I just wanna know what you think about it.  




 Welcome, and enjoy your stay... *dark laugh*.  




 3:54 is probably the best part.  




 Don't beat a dead horse. 




 It'll come back like people here have said. It's usually the other way around for me, usually I have 0 sex drive when I'm using and it comes back with a vengeance when I get clean.  




 That's fucked up man, punch him right in the dick. 

I just got my script filled (Scotland here), and I overheard someone trying to fill their opiate script and the person working there said, "Sorry, this is a controlled drug so you need a recent script (or whatever), but if you just go over to the doctors office I'm sure they'll write it for you and once they do, just come back over and we'll fill it"... So atleast there's some good people working at pharmacies.  




 I wish I was a rat... I would get all kinds of drugs all the time.  




 Do you take them longer than 1 month straight? 




 But subs basically make you dependent on THEM. It's like trading one thing for another, and the other doesn't even make you feel good... 




 *I guess they just stopped giving a fuck*... Truest thing I've read lately.  




 Why can't you guys buy codeine OTC? You can seem to do it in almost every other country.  




 I always hide my shit because I always go looking for shit when I'm sick and I usually find it, it feels like winning the lottery even though I put it there.  




 That taste smell combo when you're coming up is amazing.  




 As people said, alcohol and apap will hurt your liver, but drinking + opiates, can kill you, and has killed people through respiratory depression.  




 Morphine is made to be shot up, oral and snorting bio sucks so much.  




 Yep, pharma grade heroin is clear as water.  




 It most likely wasn't just heroin, it was most likely cut with fentanyl as well.  




 Si.  




 Yes, yes you do. *hugs* 




 This is what professional means...  




 I wouldn't call them "anonymous **PSYCHOPATHS**". Most people on the internet that send death threats are just people that can't take their inner rage out at someone in real life, so do so to someone they hate over the internet.  




 He just said he was 1.  




 ESEA: Here Valve, this is how you do it. 




 Or it's British for disgusting, dirty etc.  




 Best strategy. 




 JW's name shouldn't be 'JWonderchild' it should be 'JWanker'...  




 I wouldn't say you're schizophrenic at all. Schizophrenia is a chronic illness, and the early signs are usually there for years before you get a full blown episode, and months (sometimes years) you get a prodrome which is basically the illness leading up to the illness. 

You're just paranoid, people with bipolar can get paranoid too you know.

I'm schizophrenic btw, if that means anything. 




 It's really good. I'm so bad at ready walls of text though because I usually miss lines... Upvoted. 




 His poetry usually makes no sense at all, it's actually really amusing.  




 Mixing Ambien w/heroin is just about as dangerous as mixing benzos and dope.  




 In my view, I think that if you legalize heroin for 21+ at about 2.5g per 2-3 days then that would actually help more people than it hurts. Getting heroin off the street is what makes heroin dangerous. Pharma grade diamorphine (heroin) is no worse than oxycodone, morphine etc... Hydromorphone is actually stronger I believe. 

Over here in the UK we already use diamorphine medically, and not just for terminally ill patients either. 

Edit: Nothing ever happens over night, and nothing ever happens if we just sit on our asses and do nothing because we think it's impossible.  




 Are you against recreational legalization? 




 Yep... Most drugs that have been highly researched (including most opiates) should be legal.  




 I do believe how things are worded matter, I just don't think anyone should really care about it if we kinda know what he meant... You know what I mean?  




 Man, who cares on how he worded it? Cut the dude some slack. 




 I know that my life may not be completely ruined but I just can't help that I could've done so much more if it weren't for me being "ill". I've even said to my self, "what's the point in going back if I'm a year and a bit behind everyone". Nothing feels like a huge accomplishment, it feels more like a completely failure in my life, and that I've dug a hole that I can't get out of because of something that I couldn't have controlled, or maybe I could've controlled it... I don't know any more. 

I have positive times where I say to myself, "maybe school just isn't/wasn't for me right now and that I've learned a lot of stuff myself and maybe that'll come in handy", but no one else seems to agree... I know that I have to go back to school, that's not what I am even saying to people, I'm just saying that I've learned a lot of somewhat useful things while I wasn't at school, but people always seem to disagree when I bring that up thinking that I mean that I won't go back to school, and it shoots my confidence all the way back down again. 

Thank you for making me feel better and actually listening to what I have to say, unlike others in my life right now. 




 My man Vincent, you always have money... You need more opiates for that money you always got.  




 Damn man, to be fair, I would probably do that haha. You would have taken them again if you did, most likely. 




 If it's stealing illegal drugs, then it's a little different because I doubt that the guys that got robbed are gonna go to the cops and complain that their heroin was stolen.  




 Fires smell good... I don't know why, but they do. 

Note: I don't set stuff on fire.  




 Quick question though... Is it possible to EVER take stuff from the pharmacy, in small quantities, because I've heard of pharmacists doing that.  




 I never understood why people don't like opiates, whereas people like us do? I'm on a mission to find out... 

Note: We were nauseas on them first too, so it can't be that.  




 I'm not a girl, I'm just fat as fuck lol, but I've never had good veins, even when I was a normal weight... They're always hiding, even nurses/doctors have a hard time.  




 I'd like to point this out, as crazy as this may sound /s... Giving someone a syringe that they are paying for is extremely humane. How would you like it if you were addicted to heroin, and no one gave you a clean rig, and you contracted a life threatening disease, like Hep C and HIV?  




 I literally can never see my veins... I always wanted veins like those, *sigh* maybe in another life. Hope you enjoy that shit.  




 I don't really know where to start, but I'll try anyway. I was diagnosed with Psychosis NOS about a year and a few months ago, then it progressed into a diagnosis of basically schizophrenia, to put it bluntly. With schizophrenia we have 2 blocks of symptoms, negative and positive. Negative is basically, lack of emotion, extreme lack of motivation, poor hygiene, disorganization (which Is pretty strong for me, stronger than the other negative symptoms) etc. Positive symptoms are just basically psychosis. Anyway, because of this, I had do drop out of school, as directed by my doctors. I lost most of my friends, except one and he has always been my best friend, but he's just came back into the picture (which is great btw, when you've been in extreme isolation for a year that shit will touch your heart more than anything). Being in extreme isolation and barely getting sunlight other than the sun rays coming through my window, is extremely depressing especially when you're not in an episode and have to reflect on how this has affecting your life... 

I've just started getting tutoring back in my school, once a week... I don't see the point in going back to school any more, I'm already behind everyone, people think I'm stupid because I don't go to school (even though I've learned a lot of stuff on my own in the past year). Schizophrenia (with depression, but depression hasn't been diagnosed, it's probably depression because of the schizophrenia). I feel absolutely hopeless, it's like I can't get something inside my head out... I just want to be normal again, but there's always something inside my mind stopping me. I used to think I would have a good career, have a good life etc... That's all completely ruined now.

I'll answer any question to clarify anything... Thank you. 




 Here in Scotland we don't have to pay for scripts, you live in England? 




 Trainspotting.  




 Everyone knows that green crack doesn't cure anything, it just makes you go insane, kill everyone then turn gay... /s 




 Kinky... 




 Why not? I would show this to my boss... 




 I was watching a little bit of news last night for some reason on TV (I live in the UK), and they still spoke about it a little.  




 Do you know how the world works? Or do you live in a delusion of grandeur all the time?   




 Highly contagious Bird Flu is probably my worst fear when it comes to pandemics.  




 Illuminati confirmed...   




 I honestly think Half Life 3 or EP3, will still be coming out... You know, they could be doing this all for marketing. Making people wait 10 or maybe 15 years, that could drive sales through the roof when it finally comes out, I would think.  




 Yeah I figured it might not be used for that, I'm not actually prescribed it for insomnia, I'm prescribed it for schizophrenia but it was nice to have that sleep aid feature... And dude, that sucks, ask your doc for a benzo or something to sleep.  




 I just got prescribed Seroquel XL 200mg. I used to take 100mg x2 but because it's easier to take 1 pill rather than 2 a day she moved me onto the prolonged release. I am not sleeping when I take it at night, it doesn't even make me tired like the IR versions did, not even one bit... Actually, the first time I took it (which was last night) I was up all night until 9am. I don't understand because Seroquel used to make me pretty tired when I took my night time dose, but the XL doesn't at all... Why is this? I of course take it for Schizophrenia but it was nice to sleep when I took it because I do usually have insomnia as well.  




 The "weed" smokers that spoke about it non stop and acted higher than they actually where in high school were probably the most annoying people at that time. 




 That would be cool as hell. 




 You are incredibly wrong and ignorant.  




 Well over here in the UK diamorphine (heroin) is given to you when you're in extreme pain and morphine just won't cut it, and heroin is quite big here, especially in Scotland. 

EDIT: Usually drug addicts don't use their DOC because it's "cool" btw.  




 An opiate that doesn't kill you through respiratory depression, meaning you can go as high as you want without dying of respiratory failure. It doesn't cause nausea at any dose whatsoever, and at very, very large doses, is psychedelic and at very, very low doses feels a lot like Amphetamine without the comedown. 




 Well you do sound fucked... Hard to believe that there is 0 euphoria. 




 How much did you do? And what ROA? 




 Poppy Seed Tea. THAT IS ALL... But in all seriousness, OP, morphine is my favourite opiate, but I usually get 'Morphine Oral Solution' which has always worked for me. It is definitely more of a body high, but I always feel great on morphine, whether I get the oral solution or I bang that shit. 

 




 That's how aiming usually works in FPS's (besides recoil control). You aim, you shoot (and control recoil) and you kill... What are you trying to get at here?
