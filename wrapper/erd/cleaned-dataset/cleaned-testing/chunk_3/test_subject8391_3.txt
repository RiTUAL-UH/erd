 Crumple a piece of aluminim foil and place it in with your laundry to dry -- it will remove all the static cling without any of the chemicals found in dryer sheets and it can be reused about 3 months 









 Done. Thanks for the invite to do so.

 Most parks within the national park system are free, but many of the most popular ones have an entrance fee. There are [over 100 of these](http://www.nationalparksblog.com/national-park-fees-list/) 




 Yes.

 Video Explanation:

Ivn Fernndez Anaya: True Sportsmanship Display @ Cross Country Race, Burlada 
Is winning all that counts? Are you absolutely sure about that?

Very little has been said about this.....On 22 December 2012, Basque athlete Ivn Fernndez Anaya was competing in a cross-country race in Burlada, Navarre. He was running second, some distance behind race leader Abel Mutai - bronze medalist in the 3,000-meter steeplechase at the London Olympics. As they entered the finishing straight, he saw the Kenyan runner - the certain winner of the race - mistakenly pull up about 10 meters before the finish, thinking he had already crossed the line.

Fernndez Anaya quickly caught up with him, but instead of exploiting Mutai's mistake to speed past and claim an unlikely victory, he stayed behind and, using gestures, guided the Kenyan to the line and let him cross first.

Ivan Fernandez Anaya, a Basque runner of 24 years who is considered an athlete with a big future (champion of Spain of 5,000 meters in promise category two years ago) said after the test:
"But even if they had told me that winning would have earned me a place in the Spanish team for the European championships, I wouldn't have done it either. I also think that I have earned more of a name having done what I did than if I had won. And that is very important, because today, with the way things are in all circles, in soccer, in society, in politics, where it seems anything goes, a gesture of honesty goes down well."

He said at the beginning: unfortunately, very little has been said of the gesture. And it's a shame. In my opinion, it would be nice to explain to children, so they do not think that sport is only what they see on TV: violent kicks in abundance, posh statements, fingers in the eyes of the enemy ...

 Personal finances is usually the discussion of money, how to earn it and where it goes. Is that really what should be the focus when helping people with personal finances? Are there other, less obvious aspects that people need to learn to be better with their personal finances? I came across [this article](http://blog.creditkarma.com/personal-finance/financial-importance-of-knowing-yourself/) which got me thinking that those that know themselves well are probably better with their personal finances than those that don't.  




 Yes, there is another Fort Bragg in CA north of San Francisco 
























 Smithsonian Magazine is sponsoring [Museum Day Live](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/museumday/) for many museums across the US [participating museums here](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/museumday/venues/) and [get ticket here](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/museumday/ticket/).

Hat Tip: [jennyanthajets](http://www.reddit.com/user/jennyanthajets) from [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/freebies/comments/10be8b/reminder_next_saturday_929_is_a_free_entrance_day/) 




 Saturday September 29 is [National Public Lands Day](http://www.publiclandsday.org/) and as part of that, all [National Parks are offering free entrance](http://technorati.com/lifestyle/travel/article/free-entrance-to-national-parks-on/). Here is a [list of National Parks which usually charge a fee](http://www.nationalparksblog.com/national-park-fees-list/), but will be waived on the 29th. 



















 Yes, it is a bit confusing. Any entity that falls under the national park system (park, monument, preserve, seashore, etc) are all consider "parks" (there are 397 of them). The link you gave shows all those that charge an entrance fee (most don't at any time) -- and that fee is waived on the free days. 




 For those planning outings ahead a little further, there are also free entrance days to national parks in the US over the [Veteran's Day Weekend from November 10 - 12](http://www.nationalparksblog.com/national-park-free-days-2012/) 









 I'm looking for the best bank to help kids learn about personal finance. The one I seem to come across the most is the [Money Savvy Pig](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/mspig.gif), but there also seem to be [others that are similar](http://www.kidbanks.com). Is this the best piggy bank for kids or is there a better one? 









 It might actually make the [tax situation even worse](http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/106046/why-ryan-makes-romneys-tax-problem-even-worse) 


































 Thank you. I will do :) 




 Sorry to be so vague -- it just kind of hit me when I read that piece that I have more image issues than I thought. I'm curious how people take steps to feel better about their body. I know mine will never be perfect, but are there good tips to being comfortable and satisfied with it even when it might not be perfect?I know this is kind of scattered, but I haven't spent a whole lot of time thinking about it. 









 Yes -- the entrance fee includes the parking fee. 




 No, the dates change every year. In 2011 it was June 21 (The first day of summer). 









 Posted [this](http://technorati.com/lifestyle/travel/article/free-entrance-to-national-parks-june/) earlier this week, but thought a reminder was in order for those making weekend plans. You can see all the free admission days for national parks for 2012 [here](http://www.nationalparksblog.com/national-park-free-days-2012/) 
























 Except these animals have long pointy horns several feet long and swim together in fairly compact pods. It seems that they would stab others in the group on a regular basis...

 yes, I guess -- just doesn't make sense why the god described in the bible would "bless" someone that totally doesn't believe in him while forsaking those that do. 




 Even though I don't believe in him, I have what most religious people would considered to be an incredibly blessed life, yet many of those who do believe have what would be considered much less blessed a life.  

























































































 That's fantastic. I've always struggled with this. I need to be more willing to buy myself the things that I want and not hope others will get them for me.
