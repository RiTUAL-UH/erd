 including the Wikipedia page on Nemtsov

I couldn't find anything about this alleged affair on his [English Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Nemtsov)

Quote from pro-Russia writer you linked
 
Back then, the opposition believes, the leak was organized by the FSB security service and was directed at Mr. Nemtsov to discredit the politician.

Who trusts information originating from anonymous FSB/KGB leaks?


This is the narrative [Russian-bots  tried spreading on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ASLuhn/status/571479498560028672) right after his death.

"Ukrainians killed him...he was stealing one of their girlfriends" 

Here's a screen-grab http://imgur.com/P9iyQrk

Question. - Was it ["rain washed away all usable traces of the Nemtsov murder"](https://twitter.com/WashingtonPoint/status/572093991086374912) or did workers [power-wash the Moscow sidewalk](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/28/article-urn:publicid:ap.org:53ebc6cafbac431d9329c976a561f459-6WggR6hpV-HSK1-988_634x422.jpg) where Nemtsov was gunned down to deliberately remove all usable traces?


 




 That's a very slanted hit piece

From [buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/miriamelder/new-york-observer-stands-by-journalist-who-smeared-kremlin-f#.ip327m7z0q)

The New York Observer is standing by a reporter who has written more than a dozen articles for the outlet with a **slavishly pro-Kremlin bent**, the most recent a story **with no sources** that blames the murder of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov on his love life.

-

The reporter, Mikhail Klikushin, has written 15 articles for the outlet since November 2014, according to the Observers website. **He has no online presence  in English or Russian  beyond the stories he has written for the Observer**, which have also been picked up by other outlets. **A Nexis search turns up no public record of Klikushin**.

-

**Klikushins 15 articles are remarkable in how directly they line up with pro-Russian propaganda points**. The Kremlin regularly issues talking points, either via official statements or, more often, by reports in state-run or Kremlin-friendly media

 Lulek's Rifle

At one of the station stops, my thoughts were interrupted by a group of American soldiers standing on the platform. Noticing the placard on one of the train doors: "Children of Buchenwald Coming Home," written in English and French, some of them got on the train and started talking to us. Lulek was sitting next to me, nibbling on an apple.

-

 One of the soldiers asked him in Yiddish what he would most like right now. Lulek did not hesitate. Pointing to the soldier's rifle, he said he wanted to kill German murderers. The soldier exchanged glances with his friends and got of the train. A few minutes later he returned, carrying a small rifle with the firing mechanism removed. "Kill as many as you can," he said, giving Lulek the gun.

 He wanted to kill Obama

Page 4 

"Greetings We too wanted to pledge our allegiance and commit ourselves while not present there. I am in USA now but we don't
have any arms. But is it possible to commit ourselves as dedicated martyrs anyway while here?
What I'm saying is, to shoot Obama and then get shot ourselves, will it do? That will strike fear in the hearts of infidels."

"In addition, JURABOEY stated that he would harm President Barack Obama if he had the opportunity to do so, but currently does not have the means or an imminent plan to do so." 

-

Page 6

-

While admitting that he does not like President Obama because of bis role in killing Muslims through his support of Israel and the recent bombing of ISIL, JURABOEY stated that he would not kill President Obama because of ill
will towards him, but rather because of "Allah." When asked to clarify the nature of his contact with ''H......news.com," JURABOEY stated that he wanted to communicate his approval of the actions of ISIL and establish contact with the group. He added that, if ISIL ordered him to kill President Obama, he would do so.
He further stated that any order to kill the President could come from anyone within ISIL-not necessarily only from ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi-provided that the order had a basis in the Koran and the "Sunna" (the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad). JURABOEV noted that if he received an affirmative or positive response from ISIL to the above-referenced posting on H......news, he would kill President Obama. JURABOEV added that he would also plant a bomb on Coney Island if he were so ordered by ISIL.


What a talker...

This is from the [study](http://vinc.s.free.fr/IMG/palsd_hydro-2.pdf)  Wadi Gaza Wetland Area by [The Mediterranean Wetlands Initiative](http://medwet.org/aboutmedwet/)  


-

"Yet it is evident that," Wadi Gaza used to flow in winter and bring huge
amounts of rainwater, disturbing the transportation between the northern and
southern parts of the Gaza Strip" (Goodson, 1999). Also due to interviews with
the local community of the wadi they confirmed that wadi Gaza used to flow
regularly during the winter season for at least two months and used to bring
huge amounts of water.
Since the early seventies this amount of water started to decrease considerably
due to the built up of [check dams](http://www.appropedia.org/Check_dam) and diversion schemes by Israel on the upper
course of the Wadi (Photo.., Annex 3). 
Since then the volume and duration of flow has decreased much with some
occasional flash floods sweeping down the Wadi bed at wet years. 

-

"Interviews with local
community of the area clears out that the wetland site till the late sixties
(1960's) was much bigger than it is now. Local people says that the wetland site
was permanently flooded and that it was like a jungle starting about 100 to 150
m from the railway line..."

-

Although accurate topographical maps are unavailable, the watershed of [Wadi Gaza [wikimapia.org]](http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en lat=31.412183 lon=34.449949 z=14 m=b show=/27826964/Gaza-Wadi) is estimated to cover more than 3500 km2 of the Northern Negeve Desert and the Hebron Mountains as well as the small catchment in Gaza. The Wadis length from origin to mouth is about 105 km, where the last 9 km of it is located in Gaza Strip. Its name Wadi Gaza is only for the last part which is located in Gaza. Wadi Gaza has two main tributes one is [Wadi Alshariah [wikimapia.org]](http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en lat=31.358914 lon=34.569340 z=13 m=b) which collects water from the Hebron Mountains in the West Bank and the other is [Wadi Alshallala [wikimapia.org]](http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en lat=31.321821 lon=34.490461 z=15 m=b show=/31088593/) which collects water from the Northern Negeve highest.

Conclusion: There are no dams and the diversions mitigate flooding.
