 Yo entraba a ElChat.com! Me acuerdo que el logo era un smiley amarillo en el que tenas que hacer click para entrar. Era muy bizarro, haba mil salas, la mayora sexuales y poda entrar 1 hora por da mximo porque era por dial-up y si no venian 9999$ de telfono.  

Me acuerdo de jugar en ciberjuegos.com, de entrar a cualquiera.com.ar, trucoteca.com, buscaba las cosas en altavista.com, super old todo. 




 Wow, I had the definitions all wrong. You just made me realize I'm an introvert

 Friedick Nietzsche 




 I always thought about something in particular that I'd like to share. 

We are a very, VERY new species. We're on our very infancy; if we took all the time Earth has existed and compressed it in 24 hours, civilization exists about 4 miliseconds before midnight. Let alone speak about our time since the Universe itself exists. We, in the cosmic scale, exist for no more than a fraction of the blink of an eye.   

Yet, we have done so much things. We've traveled to our distant moon, and layed pieces of ourselves in other planets. We have already begin to explore our solar system, in so little time.  

What do all things alive want? What's the ultimate instinct of all species? To STAY alive. If you bear that in mind, and also that we have existed for so litte, you'll see that we have yet to evolve a awful lot. I think we'll get to a point in which we'll learn that the best way to survive, is to coopearte with each other. Now, I see that happening in a lot of time, maybe millions of years, but I definitely see that as a real possibility. I believe once we've achieved that point, in which we only wish to survive as a whole species, progress is going to be made a lot, lot faster. We're not as intelligent as we could be, and we know that. Killing ourselves is not the best way to coexist, and maybe one day we'll get pass that. 


Now, if you take into account all these things that I said, maybe we could exist for much much longer, and achieve an understanding of spacetime beyond our dimensions. Maybe we'll discover a form of fuel that lets us travel a lot faster and a lot cheaper. Maybe in a long time we'll be able to actually go to other galaxies, to bend and stretch the dimensions of spacetime to our likehood. It's a possibility that I like to imagine. 

This is why I think it is actually possible to know other civilizations, to enter other galaxies, to spread our species accross the universe. There's also the chance that before that, we annihilate ourselves in the next 500 years, but I like to believe otherwise. Maybe I'm just a fool, or naive, but maybe this isn't so crazy after all. 




 BECAUSE IT WAS A COMMENT IN THE FORM OF TEXT 




 Ese es el espritu 




 It sure did, thanks! 




 An outside observer would never witness you cross the horizon, as you approached, you'd slow down and any light emitted would redshift to zero

How long would this take?
 




 We would never see something going into a black hole, right? It would take infinite time from our perspective to see say a planet or a star get sucked it, because of time dilation. So, how is it that we observe they grow?  




 What if we 'faked' gravity using centrifugal force?  




 Most likely not a great glass. Amazing shot nonetheless!

 *"Now I'm going to move you from 2 to 1, boy"* 




 So much is making sense now 




 but why mail models 




 Por qu no los dos? 




 What a fucking time to be alive. I was telling my girlfriend today that I'm *convinced* I will live to see the discovery of extraterrestrial life. I'm not taking about green dudes with laser guns of course, but bacteria and microorganisms? Fuck yeah, that shit is happening in the next 50 years for sure. 




 Maybe he's in love with him and his brain says "don't be near him, it's too painful" but his heart s says "be with him anyways". I mean, basing on those messages he really cares for OP.  




 But I didn't. I'll leave your toothbrush and what's left of my broken heart in your mailbox. 




 I agree, but it's still great to hear from it officially. It just means the paperwork ended and they can now start working on the pre-production of the series. 




 Why 




 That's a very good example, but I understood this with another very similar one I'd like to share: "there is an infinite ammount of numbers between 1 and 2, but none of them are 3". 




 You are very talented, this is awesome 




 Username checks out 




 Didn't know this had a name. Very Salvia Divinorum alike! 




 Try imgur.com 




 That's trully terrible. Here's the brick video, beware, very horrifying screaming https://youtu.be/3bO0CuXpnd4 




 An overload to the eyes? What? I think it looks gorgeous, and I'd love to play it like this. Of course, to each their own taste, so...  

On the FPS part, I suppose OP has a very good PC and plays it at a good FPS rate. It takes an expensive rig to run this at 60FPS, but it can be achieved. 









 Username checks out, I'll believe this guy. He seems experienced. 




 Not for much longer

 I bet you like your own profile pictures and posts con Facebook 




 For example? 




 Great responses, thanks a lot for your time! 




 Classic guys 









 Just clicking the sound icon in the tab and disabling it 




 That would be 10 to the power of 40, or a 1 with 40 zeroes. Not 1040. 




 Thanks! I didn't rotate my camara. I used a fisheye lens (Nikkor 10.5mm f/2.8) and the terrain wasn't a straight line. These two factors combined did this effect.

Those lights at the two sides are from two cities far away, bare in mind that this photograph got 30 minutes of exposure, so those lights came out strong. 




 How did this started? 




 Yay 




 That's ridiculous, it's white and gold

  Luckily however I had watched Dragon Ball Z as a child.

Haha god, I totally lost it there.  









 No creo. La edad juega seguro, si voy yo con mis 23 aos me ven como un pendejo y seguro me como una boludeada enorme, ni hablar si caigo en las maras, la veo difcil generar respeto. No s que edad tenia este flaco cuando fue pero parece de al menos unos 30 




 Yo soy fotgrafo, lo nico que hace falta es animarte a salir. A mi me encanta este tipo de fotografa pero no me dan las pelotas para salir a meterme al medio de los tiros, o al menos no por ahora.

Estudi periodismo y vas a encontrar ofertas de corresponsales por todos lados, y si no tens ninguna, te mands igual. El tipo tuvo sus primeros laburos grosos con las maras de Guatemala, es "simplemente" ir hasta all y empezar a preguntar. Ir despacio y conociendo gente, te vas haciendo un nombre de a poco y despus te llegan ofertas ms grosas. Adems, oferta de laburo va a haber siempre, no te creas que sobran fotgrafos que tienen ganas de ir al medio de un campo de minas. 









 Y, s. La palabra te lo dice, des-ayunar, salir del ayuno. Fast en ingls adems de rpido tambin es ayuno, break-fast.  

Siguiendo esta logica yo voy a desayunar pizza con coca, viva todo 




 I can't even 




 Oh god, I've truly never laughed so much at a comment in my life 




 In the new riddle they stick their spears through your fucking stomach for questioning their authority 




 Definitivamente est disponible, debe ser por el celu 




 That's correct. There's also another that says "porn actresses and free videos". The fun part is that the 3 very NSFW pages appear as soon as he hits "www". 









 You. You get things done. 




 Aparently no, or someone did and thought it was funny and said nothing. Of course the media did and it was all over the news the day after.

The best part was that they kept running it. I searched it but couldn't find it, I don't remember which province was it. If I find it I'll post it here.

EDIT: HA! Found it. 00:19 is where it's at.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Nrcd0Czu4 




 Sometimes I go on a porn adventure, opening related videos and I end up watching some amateur booty going up and down and up and down and that video is named something like 1912894pk_9845912_mwv in a pornsite which I've never fucking heard of but it's cool because I'm now stroking myself blind and then I cum and play League of Legends a while or cook something, but then if I want to watch it again because it's been a hard week or some shit like that I go to my history and there it is, it's cool. 




 The suspense is killing me 




 Tagged as "fucked by /u/Hi-lo" 




 In my country a few years ago a province spot came on, telling about how we've improved our connections and technologies since the last goverment and such, and in a moment a dude is typing the website of that province, and for a split second it shows "www.xvideos.com". 

God damn browser history.

Edit: found it, posted it below as well but fuck it, check 00:19 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Nrcd0Czu4

 I just can't trust you anymore, Claudio. 




 Classic Claudio 




 Haha, I saw this exact same thing a couple of days ago. The dragon flew by, the giant fell and insta-died when he landed. It was funny as shit.

I just hope TES VI has funny bugs as well. 




 Tell that to Van Gogh 




 And why is he saying it's a TV remote and not just any remote?  




 Thanks a lot! Make sure you post the result :)

Look, I just snapped this upvote with my 10mm lens inverted. It's really fun to make macros with this technique: http://i.imgur.com/46bocpu.jpg 




 Yes! 35mm is a great focal lenght for achieving this. Make sure you open the diaphragm a bit (not fully open). You can do this by sliding to the sides a little metal piece in the back of the lens, which controls the aperture. 




 This is a Nikon 50mm f/1.8 lens inverted on a Nikon D90. 

Inverting lenses that are in the range of normal-wide gives you an incredible amplification and you can get really good macros with it. The 18-55mm and the 18-105mm that come as a kit in basic reflex are great for doing this, at 18mm you get CRAZY magnification.  




 Haha, indeed it does. Thanks! 




 The guy's just saying her that he wants more, because it hurts having her only as a bootycall (or sorts). That fucking bitch posts this man's pain on Facebook and laughs at it, what the fuck? She even likes her own picture... Definitely nothing wrong with the dude here, although if I were him I wouldn't got together with her after she posted those awful screenshots. 














 Are you Paarthunax 




 Also,[ proof](http://i.imgur.com/85scGkg.jpg) [NSFL] 




 Well, I guess he did free'd me from the bet a few comments below, but I also guess I have to keep up to my word. 




 You're on. 




 This is so fucking on.

 What a fucking *peasantsaurus*. 




 That PCs and notebooks make high pitched noises when showing results or loading things. What the fuck? That would be annoying as fuck.

Also, that nobody presses enter when making a web search, they always go and click "search". No one does that. And don't even get me started on the "enhance that" part when showing security camera footage that has been zoomed 700%, and goes from a blur of 3 pixels to a DSLR 30MPx photo.

 This is totally true. I saw it happening, I'm a ladybug as well. After this happened, me and the other ladybugs started clapping, and we gave this person %100 ladybug-dollars each.   

We are really happy that the Lord brought us our bug friend. That ladybug's name?

EDIT: I had to edit because right when I was writing this post, my uncle who's a FBI agent entered my house and we had to evacuate because the president Obama was coming to hide (he needed a special place and my house was built with a paint coating that resists even nuclear explosions), and this whole thing made me spell a word wrong, but I can't discuss anything else with you guys, I'm on a plane as we speak on my way to a secret bunker. 




 Those fucking endless infinite patterns... Hard to forget 




 Yeah, here in southamerica the closest we get to Pi Day is January 3rd :( 




 I agree 100% with you on this one. I may get downvoted because of this comment (I'm stating no opinion or contributing discusable material on the subject) but I just sincerily felt my upvote wouldn't cut it, and felt the need to put it in words.  




 I drink beer often, and smoke weed even more regulary. I think it's most because spilling weed feels worst than spilling beer, because of what "it represents" (in terms that weed is more expensive and more difficult to get because of its legal status than beer).

Also, and I'm not saying you're stating this (other comments above are), I don't see why saying you do drugs is a synonim of looking for attention. They're forbidden, yes, but at what point? Beer and marijuana are among the easiest accesible drugs for everyone. The social judgement of them has changed so much that doing them isn't seen as rebellion anymore (weed may be a little more arguable at this point though). I don't think stating that you smoke weed is looking for attention. Sure, lots of teenagers and stupid adults do, but I think they're a minority among drug users.  




 Wow, that's incredible. Totally going to try that at home!
