 Heck, I would skip the work from selling the costumes and just keep on making gold and other important resources that I can then sell.  




 Okay, who put the Flintstones into anime? 




 Thing is, it is a gigantic series of shows if you decide to delve into the "Nasuverse". 

Here is /r/anime's guide on how to get into the Fate series: http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq-fate 




 A few things of note:

* You may want to fix your typos
* Try to keep titles consistent
* Remove the unnecessary capitalization 


A bit of a personal thing, but I cannot see Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu Season 2 being better than Toradora. Heck, the characters were worse than the first season.
  




 I hope this does well, this seems to be a shounen take on Marvel/DC comics which is really interesting.  




 Shouldn't the free space move down one? 




 Other than some OEL stuff and some light novels, the first volume of manga that I bought was Volume 1 of Nisekoi while I was in Japan. (If manga were that cheap here, I would buy a lot more of it. It was ~$4 USD instead of the $10 it would be in English)

I know why it is more in the US, but I can still gripe about it. (Licensing it, translation, redrawing, cover design changes if needed, printing, advertising, shipping, etc)  




 I thought it was centimeters. (As such 15 cm is about 6 inches, which is the length of a dollar bill) 




 For those of you wondering [this is one of the frames](http://i.imgur.com/guof8lv.jpg) that shows what they are asking about.

It almost looks like Emiya's "Trace On" ability that was shown when repairing the heater and also when strengthening the poster when he was defending against Lancer. 




 Did anyone else see [this?!?!?!](http://i.imgur.com/guof8lv.jpg) During the part where Archer is preparing his sword/arrow/drill there was a series of ~6-8 frames where it flashes Emiya's "Trace On" but it has Archer's hand/arm behind it. 

I stepped through the frames and this is the clearest one that has them both in it.

NOTE: I haven't played UBW, so I have no idea if this is of major importance. 




 Berser-car reminds me of Bowser Jr. from Super Smash Bros 4 with the small wheels, car with a face and cannon out the mouth. 




 The cigarettes would become lollipops with smoke coming out of them. 




 It is a light novel series in which each chapter is important to the story that they couldn't skip much, if any, of it. So far, there are 216 chapters out, 214 have been translated. To give the series its full worth, it would have to be a good number of episodes. (100 may be stretching it, but I would see 50+) 

The story also comprises the life of Rudeus starting from his infancy. 




 Not only that but some of the content would make it difficult to adapt. 




 Without compression, this is how it would turn out: The resolution would be 1280x720 so 345600 pixels. Since every color can be expressed by a 0-255 integer and there are three colors that comprise one pixel there are a total of 1036800 integers at a time. Considering that they can use an integer that only takes 8 bits of data (2^8 -1, which is 0-255) this means that a single frame takes up 1.037 MB. At thirty frames a second it would be 31.11 MB/s.

Now, this is why people have developed compression for video as you do not need to send every frame but only the pixels that have changed. 

---
For a true idea of the amount of data that it would take: According to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/1r6fz4/ps4ps_vita_remote_plays_uses_2030mbs_per_minute/) post on /r/vita the PS4-PS Vita uses ~20-30 MB per minute. (So anywhere from 0.33-0.5 MB/s) Odds are the PS4-PS4 uses the same idea and code as the PS4-Vita remote play so this should be about right.

EDIT: Removed trailing parenthesis and elaborated on the last sentence of the "Without compression" part. 




 The Clannad OST, along with Key's other works, is on the US iTunes right now. Key/VisualArts seems to be releasing all of their soundtracks and albums internationally. 




 There is also episode 3. 




 Bubblews is a mixed bag. Some love it while others claim it is just a big scam and if there is anything suspicious with your account, even if it isn't your fault, they will not pay you.

As for the foreign thing, I have no idea. 




 Nope. It was the first of their "Kinetic Novel" line, but it was not their first work. (Planetarian came out in 2006, while Clannad was out in 2004 and Kanon/Air even sooner.) 




 Huh, while I bought it used it seemed as though it was barely opened. Where you got yours from might have been a reprint or thrown away. 




 A little context for this, I found this slip within the booklet in the copy of the Clannad Soundtrack that I managed to find while I was in Japan. It seems to be announcing Key's "new" works such as Planetarian along with advertising their "current" games such as Air, Kanon, and Clannad.  









 Yeah, but that is only two seasons worth of episodes. (1 on, 1 off, 1 on) 




 It is where a series of two, or more, cour length is split over multiple seasons alternating whether it is airing or not.

Most of the time it just airs for a total of two seasons, but for the first time there is a series that is going to do split cour for a total of three seasons' worth of episode. (It will take five seasons to complete) It is the new Durarara anime that is doing this.  




 Shh, that never happened. It was never adapted until 2006. 




 Two seasons. (Each season is ~11-13 episodes long so this one will go for 22-26 episodes) 




 My guess is that we will know in due time.  




 I think OP is looking for an anime where the MC chooses everyone. (Not the sort of unknown end either) 









 For those of you wondering why I posted this, I decided to compare the fan translation/scan to the actual published volume to look for differences.

I found a few others but those are mainly details and the fan translation/scan cut a little bit off the top and bottom of the image. 




 That dang cat getting in on busting on Suzuki's well, uh, bust. 




 Do you have access to a black/whiteboard? One of the games that the anime club at my university plays is something along the lines of pictionary where you have one person draw something from a show and people have to guess where it is from or what character it is.

You'd have to have someone, who is running it, that pulls aside the person before they start drawing and ask them who/what they are going to draw so that when people guess you can judge whether it is right or wrong.

It is pretty fun and it can go for any length of time, but thirty minutes would be more than enough. 




 Rather than waiting for the third season that will never come, how about reading the light novels? They are available in English up to volume 11 or 12 out of 17 total volumes. 

The first season covers 1 and 2 and the second season covers 3 and 5. (They skipped volume 4) 




 They were ~$750 USD at the time those posts went up in Japan. 




 Would it account for all 300,000 sales? No, but evidence from past shows such as *K-ON!* where [people were going out and buying the $700 USD equivalent headphones that the characters used to the point that they sold out in the stores that sell them](http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=84543) lends some credence to that possibility.

The link goes to a forum post, but they gave and linked their sources enough that it is reputable. 




 Odds are, this is what increased sales of the game in Japan due to fans of the show going out and buying the game that the character is playing. 




 Heck, they even had the day theme from the game playing during the episode! 




 Most fansub groups have an IRC channel with a number of XDCC bots for people to use. So yeah, they are still around. 




 This is just /a/ pulling crap. I've read the manga up to the point that has been translated and none of this happens. 

Heck, other than the second point, those cannot happen as it is a "shounen" manga which is geared towards boys 12-19-ish...

 The one thing I really like about the recent posts by /u/Shadoxfix's bot, which uses his account, is that he includes the link to where you can legally watch it. 

I think there was something wrong with the bot so I copied the source from the episode 2 post, added the link to the second episode discussion and submitted it. 




 It is on Funimation. (You need their subscription to see the third episode but you can watch the first and second ones for free) 

There are *other* methods out there, but you are on your own.

 Better yet, when/if the kickstarter meets or exceeds its goal in November, the game will be released in English! (Sekai Project is even trying to get it on Steam but that one would be the all ages version. No idea how it is going to be all-ages without some of the scenes, but Frontwing [the developer] has a Vita version out which is all-ages.)

[Here is some more information about the Kickstarter right from Sekai Project.](http://prefundia.com/projects/view/lets-bring-the-grisaia-trilogy-to-the-west/2814/)
 




 It was complicated when it happened, but I would ask for you to search "truecrypt unsafe" for yourself to get an idea of what happened. 




 **WARNING:** TrueCrypt is not safe! There has been a lot of discussion over the months that hints that the developers of TrueCrpyt were coerced by government(s) into lessening the security of the software.  




 My university's anime club is crap. A lot of issues and drama that shouldn't be there is there so I don't bother going. 

I have found a number of people who watch anime and such that are pretty cool to hang out with so I do that.

My parents know about anime and such, but I have no idea what they think of it. They also know I have a few figures, but those were ones that I got while in Japan. My Mom likes the figures and thinks they are cool, but I have no idea what my father thinks. (I have a [Saber](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/111864), [Nadeko](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/175534) and a [Saber Lily nendoroid.](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/6581)) 




 Nathan Anderson

It says so on the bottom right of the image. 




 Something something doujinshi. 




 Something something /r/tsunderesharks 




 [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq-fate) is /r/anime's FAQ/"How to get into the Fate series" wiki page. I think it is fairly clear but it depends on how far down the rabbit hole you want to go.

The Fate series is part of a larger universe which is colloquially known as the "Nasuverse". From a rough estimate, there is about ~15-20 full days worth of content. (360-480 hours!!!) 




 [Here](http://js-fireworks.appspot.com/svg/index.html) is where they got the code that they had scrolling in the background. It is a webGL experiment to launch fireworks and show a message on the screen.

EDIT: Right click and select "View Source" to see it. 




 It happens quite often in anime where a female voice actress will voice a male, but seemingly female, character. (Hayate from *Hayate no Gotoku* comes to mind.) 




 This is the first time that I have ever heard Hebrew used in an anime.

Elohim means "God" and is used in the Bible to refer to God.

I can't find much about "Essaim" though... 




 Sensei and Ninomiya-kun from Minami-ke.  




 Yeah, I was doing mTurk before I even had a job. The surveys are, mainly, just giving your opinion and the tasks, if they are made right, give you more than enough instructions to do it. 

I'd suggest going to mTurk Forum (A third party forum) and using their daily recommended hits thread to find some of the better ones.

 Then why does the ibuprofen bottle that I have list it as a fever reducer? http://i.imgur.com/XJmB0T9.jpg 




 Try using mTurk. (US Only) Unlike many of the other beermoney sites, this one always has work for people to do. It is run by Amazon, but they do not (at least that I have seen) post work themselves. People, mainly researchers, post tasks/surveys/jobs/things for people to do in return for money. I've made ~$900 over three years off and on doing odd jobs. 




 Here we go again... 

Even when she visited the university that I went to last year there were really high contentions. She had to have bodyguards and such. One thing, that I do not like about her is that she had someone pre-screen all of the questions from students even thought it was written in the contract that the Q A would be open. (Heck, she didn't even want a Q A session.) 

She talks about being a journalist but yet she does not follow the conventions of not censoring (ie. Pre-screening) speech...


As for the "feminist" side she wasn't the stereotypical nutty feminist that people make her out to be. Yeah, she tends to pick the major and blatant examples that fits her arguments but she presents them in a logical manner. 




 If anyone is wondering what it is, I guess it is the max character size in smiley faces. (2048)
 




 Not only is it a Steinway it is, most likely, a model D (9-ft grand piano used, mainly, in concert halls and it costs about $150,000 USD). They even got the internals from the main brass "Chassis" to the shape/color of the hammers to even the piano stool that they use. I think they even used a Steinway when producing the music as it sounds the same as the Steinways that I have heard.

Source: I see and hear a model D every single day and it always has its lid up, during the day. (All Steinway School) Sadly the thing is normally playing itself... :(

**EDIT**: Here are some pictures I quickly took of it:

 I hope they fall into usual patterns...

 .

 Otherwise they'd be stepping on each other's feet while dancing. 




 Don't be surprised to see Nozaki's counts go down. According to an earlier post the first volume of the anime included an event ticket which really jumps up the sales. 

Even so, I hope this means that they will make a second (or even a third) season. 




 Yeah, all of the Viz Media ones had to be removed by the developer. (There is a way around the block but involves installing a VPN and having your location set somewhere other than the US. Ironically, Japan works.) 




 Manga Rock is the one I use. It has access to a lot of different sites including batoto. (You can even search multiple sources at once!) 




 It is stated in the book that one alsin is about one meter. 

The other measurement that is unique to this series is the "koku" which is two hours. (ie. Half-koku is an hour) 




 "Friend maker" 




 While I am not a violinist, I think they even got the violin down with the correct finger placements and movement. (According to the PVs that are out.) 

I guess we'll have to wait until episode 2 to see the violin though. 




 While they aren't all Nintendo characters, there are figure shops in Japan. (Mainly around Akihabara and Nakano Broadway, but I image that there would be more around the country.) 




 While I am a mod here, I am talking as myself.

My thoughts are that you ought to make this as a "Request" thread but put the same rules and such in that post. 

My concern is that if we have this weekly, people will begin suggesting the same shows over and over until they get popular enough to break the qualifications. 

You may want to message the mods with the suggestion for a routine stickied post much like our current weekly suggestion threads. (I'd do it myself, but you are the one who has the idea and may be able to word it better than someone interpreting your post.) 




 No problem! I saw your question about it towards the mods and I double checked the rules and saw that was there. (I guess this way people can say "Hey, I like A:TLAB, what would be a good anime to watch?" and vice-versa.) 




 [Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5781/Isekai_no_Seikishi_Monogatari) - Pretty much fits your request to the letter. It is a spin-off of Tenchi Muyo but you don't have to know anything about that series to watch this one. 




 For some clarification, your recommendation of "The Legend of Korra" is allowed here since "Anime-inspired shows/films" is listed under accepted media. 




 Your link was automatically removed by AutoModerator.

Please change your link from an illegal manga site to something like MAL or Hummingbird where you can read the plot summary. 




 I am *shocked* that no one has mentioned the instruments in this episode!

They did an AMAZING job showing the instruments and the action of the keys, hammers and what not.

The Steinway   Sons piano is accurate down to the number of holes in the support, the model of the piano bench and everything else. (Source: I attend an all-Steinway university so I have seen them up close and even played them a bit. I am no where proficient with the piano but I have taken a little bit of lessons before.)

The keys that were played, throughout the episode, were accurate which really showed during the melodica scene during the trill around 17:07 is where I really noticed it. 




 Good enough that Guillermo del Toro is trying to get HBO to adapt it into a full series. (HBO is the same channel that is airing Game of Thrones) 

Source: http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/08/14/guillermo-del-toro-mentions-monster-adaptation-in-sugoi-japan-endorsement 




 Yeah, people got so many cards that they were able to guess the numbers even though they hadn't won them which is why your wins were empty. 




 Nope, the first episode was delayed until this week's monday. It will then return to its normal airing time. (Every Thursday) 




 Whoops, I meant to say for them to search for episode 1... 




 So far, there aren't any official sources for watching this show. To answer your question would be to break the rules. Try google searching for episode one since it is "out" and subbed somewhere.

Hint: Watch for /u/Shadowfix 's bot to post the discussion thread for it. It also looks the sites that people put fansubs on. 




 I wish they hadn't revealed that the red-haired girl was someone working with "Shepherd" in episode 1. I haven't read the source, as it isn't translated, but it seemed to be giving the viewer too much right off the bat. 

I guess, now the question isn't of who but why and how they are doing what they are doing.

I'll stick with this one as it seems as though it is a light-hearted series. Also, the VN is made by August who made "Brighter than the Dawning Blue" and "Fortune Arterial". (They've made others, but those two have been adapted into anime.) 




 There is "Osu!" which is a free music/rhythm game that can be played with only the mouse. There are thousands of charts/maps that are out there for you to play and there is even multiplayer. 




 That is why I said most of their shows are. Nichijou was only licensed in Australia. 




 Just because it isn't being simulcasted doesn't mean that it won't make it to the US. Odds are someone will license it considering most of KyoAni's works have been. (Except for Nichijou) 




 The CG is better in S2. 




 I think they did it like that because the MC is in the same situation. You learn of the world and what is going on as the MC does. 




 It got delayed due to a volleyball game going longer than anticipated. It was pushed to Monday. The second episode will air on Thursday at its normal time. 




 Heads up, no official source. Head to the high seas.

 Sadly people ruined the fun for everyone else by exploiting the website to generate wins. (Each win gave you $6 and they repeated it as much as they could.)

M Ms then only gave credit towards your cable bill... :( 




 Well, it is always the right moon if you *type* it out. 




 I wouldn't be surprised if that is where they got their inspiration from. 




 Welcome to the western world. They don't allow adult (AKA AO rated) content on Steam. This also goes for brick and mortar stores such as Wal Mart, Target, Best Buy, etc... 




 It may still have NSFW, but not the H, scenes in it. Sekai contacted Steam and they have worked out a way to possibly have those scenes. 




 I would suggest waiting until the game comes out on Steam. Yes, the VN (the all ages version) will be coming out on Steam in English. (Sekai Project has the rights to release it) 




 Even so, it is unmarked. 




 **WARNING:** The "Here is the original for the Amane bedroom scene is **NSFW!!!***

 There isn't anything inside the windows. It is just a gradient from the bottom right to the upper part of the middle. 




 Thing is, the writing quality of the translation is pretty good. It is a lot better than you think it is. (At least up through volume 5, which is where I am at.) There is a lot of intrigue and characterization that occurs and it is pretty good all things considered. 




 I would suggest reading the light novels. You can find them on the usual site. (It says "preview" but it is the full book.) 

The LNs are a lot better than what the anime is making it out to be. While the fan service scenes are there they are fairly short and only really happen once or twice a volume. (224 pages or so.) They are also brought up again later so they serve an actual purpose. 




 It definitely has a big budget. The big (ie. Little) things I noticed:

* Finger positions and movement while playing the violin
* The action of the piano
* The "Steinway   Sons" licensing, which I imagine would not be cheap
* Animation quality
* Sound/OST quality was really really good even though it was hosted on YouTube...
 




 Heck, Madoka was only 1 cour and you see how well that was written/done. 




 [Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought There](http://myanimelist.net/manga/41733/Gate:_Jieitai_Kanochi_nite_Kaku_Tatakeri) which applies a similar idea as Outbreak Company but with the JSDF (Japanese Self Defense Force), which is basically Japan's military. 

**WARNING**: Some of the scenes are gruesome and may contain full frontal nudity. It is still a great read and it is released monthly. 




 Even better is that you can easily buy the soundtrack through iTunes. 




 Shouldn't it be:

Counteraction:  
[X] Rising    
[ ] Falling   




 Thank you for reminding people to use the correct flair. I've changed it for OP.
