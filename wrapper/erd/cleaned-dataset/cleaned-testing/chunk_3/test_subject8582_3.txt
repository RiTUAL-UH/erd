 Sachiel gets the week of prep that Shinji and Asuka got.  









 Let's see if I can keep it going for the rest of 2015 









 A milk jug has been poured out and filled again, but this time with everyone's favorite time-travelling liquid metal (don't worry, that includes the main processor). Who can it beat? Who can beat it? 

Bonus: Who could beat [3.033*10^8 T-1000s combined into one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/2qvxg4/request_if_several_t1000s_terminator_2_could_melt/cnagnh0) 









 Legendary's new Godzilla to be specific 




 Would they be able to effectively come together to form a single unified being or would they be too separate? 









 Why does this exist? Eating tiny food to restore a percent or two at a time to get to 0% WITHIN TWO MINUTES. WHILE AN ORGY OF DEDEDES ARE CONSTANTLY UNDOING MY PROGRESS. ON THE BIGGEST STAGE IN THE GAME. I mean, for fucks sake make the good bigger or something do I can fucking SEE it. And all the stage hazards can OHKO you if god decides you haven't suffered enough. Fuck you, whoever made this event. 




 I've owned this game for over a year now and I still have no god damned clue how Caravan is played.  




 That shit is so cash I need it on my body.  




 The fight takes place in Daten City. Everyone gets six hours of prep time. 

Bonus: all three of them vs. Evangelion's angels 














 Alternatively, A Miracle on Elm Street 









 Also, is he technically a magical girl a la Sailor Moon? 









 I swear to God there is a method to my madness 




 In the theatrical cut if Army of Darkness, Ash returns to his time and saves the day from a Deadite at S-Mart. In the Director's Cut ending, we see he sleeps a century too long. The assumption is that this is the effect of a Third World War while he was asleep. But what if it was the result of the return of the Deadites during the extra century? He isn't awake to stop the Deadite at S-Mart, so that Deadite was able to take over the world starting from there.  









 The year is 2014. the King of Kings has gotten fed up with jolly old Saint Nick hogging the spotlight on the celebration of *His* birth. So, he challenges him to a competition. If Jesus wins, he gets Christmas. If Santa wins, Jesus backs down as humanity's messiah and God's right hand. 

RULES: Unless specified, Jesus doesn't get to use any feats from Revelation. He is out of character, and willing to fight rather than just pacify the situation. Santa gets his feats from all depictions **of him**. That is to say, Saint Nicholas gets feats from his various depictions. Other Santas, like Arthur Christmas, Futurama's Santa, the Grinch, Odin, and Tim Allen, **all don't count toward Santa's feats**. As long as it's Nick himself, everything else is fair game. 

Round 1: Standard bout. Post-Crucifixion Jesus Christ (PCJC). Takes place in Jerusalem. Santa gets two days of prep, no weapons. 

Round 2: They switch jobs. Jesus has to deliver all the presents, Santa has rule over the world for a night. Whoever does the other's job better wins. 

Round 3: Jesus' Super Smash Bros game of choice. Both will be using gamecube controllers (because let's be real it isn't the N64 game). Santa gets a month of training with the top competitive Smash players. 

Round 4: Swimsuit competition. 

Round 5: They are both tasked with converting an extremely cynical, closed-minded atheist to believing in them. Whoever can make him believe first without pulling anything supernatural wins.  







































 World War III has been initiated by the Illuminati and now the POTUS is the mot stereotypical American possible: fat, gun-loving, communazi-hating, overly consumerist, favorite movie is probably Saving Private Ryan or something, you know who I'm talking about. The rest of the planet is either ruled by the Fourth Reich or the Communist Empire (I'm creative, I know). Siding with either is a guaranteed victory with the same spoils for America, choosing to side with neither is guaranteed destruction. 

EDIT: BONUS ROUND: There is a fourth army in this war, led by Magneto. His army is significantly smaller and the same strength as the Commies and Nazis. Again, the only change in this is who is helping America, they will still win no matter who they choose.  




 DMX has challenged the X-Men in the most honorable of battles: a rap battle. The X-men must choose their greatest battle rapper to accept the challenge. They both get a week of prep. The X-Men aren't allowed to manipulate DMX's rapping. Who is the best rapper in the mutant world? Can they win, or is X Gonna Give it to Them? 




 What if the x.xx titles aren't meant to be pronounced "one point one one" or "one point eleven" (apply as needed to sequels). Maybe the titles are meant to be irrational numbers, like x/9. They would be pronouced x.x *repeating*. Maybe it;s nothing, but I thought it was neat.  



















 I want to main Sailor Moon, but at the same time I don't want to pour all my time into Mii Fighter only to find out that I can't play competitively.  




 So John Connor (as he appears in Judgement Day) is drafted by NERV to pilot their newest Eva model, the E-800. Obviously, we know where Sarah is in this situation. Because Third Impact has been avoided in this continuity, NERV now blows their government funding on giant robot fights for sport. These fights have pilots get in their Evas, but then the Evas are forced to go berserk because... reasons. The berserk mama bears fight in an arena setting. How does Sarah Connor fare against...

1) Eva-00

2) Eva-02

3) The MP-Eva series

4) The Angels (yeah, we cloned the Angels back to life. What are you gonna do?

4) Eva-01

All Evas are, of course, berserk. 

TL;DR Who has the best mom in all of Evangelion and/or Terminator? 




 He experiences the game as the player would, save for one thing. He carries a chainsaw out of Vault 101 with him. When Amata closes the vault door, he attempts to get back in but ends up getting his hand stuck in the door. He has to cut it off and attach the chainsaw to the stump. Now he's on his own in the Wastes. 

Victory conditions: 

Create his own army and dominate the wasteland. 

Complete the entire game, DLC included

Become known from DC to New Vegas 




 One time this werewolf motherfucker came into this apple store and started playing the default ringtone on his iPhone so everyone would have to check their phones. Not only that, but he downloaded terabytes of foot fetish porn onto the laptops. So subtle, that sneaky sneaky wolf. And the worst part? It was all legal.  









 1: Freestyle rapping

2: general rhyming

3: texting

4: Creating chaos

5: coining catchphrases

6: horrifying obsession over a coworker

7: a battle of pure coyness. Coyest diva left standing wins.  









 The Inner Senshi as they appear at the end of the original 90s anime (that is to say Sailor Moon, not Sailor Moon R). Kaworu is his Manga/TV incarnation, not Mr. Yaoi-no-Powers from 3.33. Fight takes place in the abandoned city of Tokyo-3. Everyone is in character.  









 Gamzilla uses the collective feats of both.  



















 I can't tell if it's the most commie shit or the most patriotic shit I've ever heard. 

He said he wished he weren't form the USA, so he could experience America for the very first time.

I'm still really unsure about this one.  




 Kaworu is revealed as the final angel and NERV decides not to deploy Unit-01. Instead, they send in their newest ally- the Silver Surfer. Who wins? Does humanity come out of this in multiple pieces? Both are in-character, and let's use Manga Kaworu because he's the coolest.  




 Your top 5 (try to keep them human-scale, with a maximum of like 10 feet) characters go to an abandoned cabin in the woods. They read from the Necronomicon and summon some Candarian demons. Who gets possessed first, will the others survive or will they all be Dead by Dawn?

BONUS: The last survivor gets dragged into the third movie. Will they protect the Necronomicon from the deadites? 






















































 From [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/GODZILLA/comments/2mowgl/finally_found_bc_godzilla_2014/) post on /r/Godzilla.

This team includes 4 T-800s with varying levels of damage and 2 Legendary Godzillas. Who can they beat? Who can beat them? 









 Three-way Battle of the Bands. They're only allowed to use their feats from these songs.  


































 Like, how many of you will actually talk about Lord Arceus when religion comes up in conversation? Do you answer "Arceist" to the question of religion?  









 Assume the kaiju aren't going to act like assholes while off duty. They have to defend the crucified Lilith from the angels in the same manner as the original anime, starting with Sachiel. NERV will find the Lance of Longinus at the same time that they originally did. They also get to use the A.T. Field things that Unit-13 had in 3.33. 

**If the team gets angelstomped too hard, they can start again with these modifications. 

Godzilla is the version from Final Wars. **Also gets Spacegodzilla

Mothra is also her FW incarnation. **Mothra Leo with all his BS tranformations

Rodan is Fire Rodan because regular Rodan sucks. **Also gets Megaguirus. 

King Ghidorah is his GvKG incarnation, and if he ever dies he can be rebuilt as Mecha King Ghidorah. **Replaced by Desghidorah, 

Mechagodzilla is Kiryu from Tokyo SOS. **Kiryu and MOGUERA (from Spacegodzilla)

EDIT: Also when Tabris does arrive instead of seducing Shinji he seduces Minya.  




 We all know the A.T. Field is a total Deus Ex Machina in these types of battles, so here are the rules:

No removing the A.T. Field with magic or other A.T fields/Anti-A.T. fields. 

No reality warping (we promise Unit-01 won't go all Third Impact)

Eva-01 is post-Zeruel (has an S^2 engine) and berserk. 

No mind controlling Unit-01.  
























 The combined cast of: Godzilla (all of them in their most recent film incarnations) and Pacific Rim, plus Clove, Clifford the Big Red Dog, several explicitly named Pokemon, and Gamera are put onto one island arena. No one is allowed to leave (think Destroy all Monsters). This is where your fave comes in. They are parachuted into the middle of the island with nothing but their usual gear and a GPS showing where any given kaiju is located. Can your favorite character kill every kaiju on the island? 

Kaiju list:

Godzilla: Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah, Rodan, Gigan, Mechagodzilla (70s), both MUTOs, Zilla, Orga, Baragon, Varan, Biollante, Destoroyah, Spacegodzilla, Hedorah, and Minya. 

Pacific Rim: Onibaba, Knifehead, Yamarashi, Mutavore, Leatherback, Otachi, Raiju, Scunner, Slattern 

Pokemon: Groudon, Kyogre, Rayquaza, Ho-Oh, Lugia, Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres

BONUS: They get to call in one Mass Production Evangelion for help, BUT all the kaiju will bum-rush them.  




 All of these fighters can be argued as messiah figures after J-Dawg's own image. 

This is post-crucifixion Jesus

1: Gordon Freeman. All weapons allowed. (He's beloved, bearded, messianic supersoldier)

2: The Terminator 2 T-800 (Half man, stuggles between being objectively superior to humans and also being a human. Saves the world from its own hubris. Pretty much applies from here on out)

3: Kaworu Nagisa, Evangelion

4: Eva Unit-01, Shinji piloting

5: Eva Unit-01, berserk

6: Post-Crisis Superman

7: Superman Prime 1M

And any others you think should be on the list.  














 If you've got a loser and a Jew well deserving of a Sunday blast, write about that diva roach here. AKA! 














 The fight takes place in Tokyo on a full moon. They both get a month of prep time.  




 Is that robosexuality, even though she's an angel with a human's soul inside the robot? 


































 Specifically Unit-06 from End of Eva I guess. 

Bonus: all the EVEs on the ship vs one Eva 














 This one kind of operates on the assumption that Time Loop Theory is true, but realistically we all know it is. Especially Anno. 

Mari is the backup pilot for Unit-02, when it's made clear in NGE (and *heavily* implied in Rebuild) that Eva pilots can only do so because the soul inside the Eva is their mother, which allows for them to synch properly. Asuka is the designated pilot of Unit-02, because the soul of Kyoko is inside it (her?). When Asuka is out of commission following Unit-03's activation and possesion by Bardiel, Mari takes over as pilot of 02. But she shouldn't be able to, because no one named Illustrious is the soul of 02. Not only should she not be able to pilot it, but she unlocked its ability to transform (which Asuka later ended up using). If Rebuild is truly post-EoE, Kyoko could have brought herself back from the sea of LCL as her perfect self (look how similar [they](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/122523.jpg) [are](http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/4479/384373-makinami_mari_illustrious74_large.jpg)) in order to continue protecting the next Asuka. This Asuka, however, was not her equivalent's child, due to the fact that the original was still around. This Asuka belonged to someone with the name of Shikinami. That person was presumably another scientist at Gehirn (potentially even the doctor that original Asuka's dad hooked up with when Kyoko was in the hospital) who then became new Unit-02. This would explain the redesign and upgrade. As a soul formerly known as an Eva, she is also able to pilot Unit-05 and Mark.08.  





























 I just got finished rewatching 3.33 to try and figure out why I don't like it. Maybe this has something to do with me not having seen any Eva for a month or so, but I found myself actually enjoying it more the second time around. So what *did* go wrong? What went right? Should it be considered as bad as some consider it?

Well for starters, about half of the movie is exposition or setup with no real answers. You have the opening, AKA "Get out of the fucking robot, Shinji". Then you have Shinji trying to make nice with "Rei", then the only character development in this movie (which to be fair is quite good at making you care for both Kaworu and Shinji), then "We reveal what everyone already figured out halfway through 2.22 even if you didn't see the original" with Fuyutsuki, then  "Get in the fucking robot, Shinji" from Kaworu, Kaworu explains what *Totally* happened during "Near"-Third Impact (seriously we saw you impale him with the Cassius what the hell), then Kaworu says some cryptic shit interlaced with the fight against WILLE and then the movie ends. This movie fails in a few regards because of this: NGE had very little explanation, leaving most exposition up to a few cryptic conversations where much is spoken but not much is said. This leaves the viewer to come up with their own conclusions as to what was going on in EoE, or what SEELE's motivations were. These questions make sure NGE stays in the viewer's mind, making it one of the most memorable stories in all of history. 3.33 tries to repeat this, but where it falls short is that most of the questions it leaves have only one logical answer. "What is the Vessel of Adams?" it makes the viewer wonder, then they think and say "Oh, wait, it probably has something to do with the Angels and Instrumentality. Rei-ish is probably like Kaworu with boobs and a bowl cut". NGE had questions with *really* ambiguous answers that are so open-ended that they are still being debated to this day. 3.33 tries to be a regular movie where all your questions are answered so any unanswered questions become plot holes, but also tries to keep its artsy "leave shit up to the viewer" movie like End of Eva. 

3.33 also had very little character development As a follow-up to 2.22, we already know most of these characters. We know who the main characters are (or at least are meant to be, some of the more complex characters like Asuka have had life sucked out of them in favor of being a 2D tsundere with no real character whatsoever to the point where I've started calling her Asuka-ish). But these characters have become different people to who they were 14 years prior. They either needed more development or none at all. Pick one. And then they have the balls to throw in a new character with no development whatsoever in Mari "Deus Ex" Makinami. She just shows up during action sequences to be a comic foil to Asuka-sh and fetish material to everyone else (because the original had *nothing* to say about fetishizing teenage girls in anime. DAMNIT ANNO DID YOU EVEN WATCH EVANGELION). Whereas NGE was almost entirely character with little to no exposition, occasionally broken up by giant robot action, 3.33 was the exact opposite, being no character and lots of exposition/robots. 

That being said, what 3.33 does right, it does *right*. The new robots look great (they even have a 'Mark.# naming system so we don't confuse them with the Mass Production Evas). Kaworu and Shinji share some great chemistry together, some of the scenes are pretty damn atmospheric, and the hellish imagery is greatly effective, even some of the more subtle things like Shinji being the third thing they removed from Unit-01, and it's implied that what they found in there wasn't even human. There is a lot that's left to the imagination, like what else they retrieved from Unit-01, or what how Kaworu planned to use the spears. But it's held down by the fact that it's nothing but a retread of Episode 24 of the original, which tries to explain things but keeps holding itself back for that unique street cred. 

So is 3.33 as bad as some people say? I actually have two answers. As a standalone movie, or even as the third movie in the Rebuild saga (independent from NGE) I'd say it's pretty good. No masterpiece, but it's a decent sequel to 2.22 and presumed prequel to 3.0+1.0. The character development does leave some things to be desired, but it does a good job of not holding your hand. The hellish imagery adds a lot to the overall quality and it's appropriately subtle in a lot of places. Rebuild is a must-watch for any fan of Mecha. 

As an Evangelion movie, however, I'm gonna go ahead and say it's almost, but not quite, fucking garbage. It is the antithesis to everything Neon Genesis stands for, from its bland characters (except maybe Kaworu), to its "baby's first mindfuck" approach to Fourth Impact, to its sine-waving between Evangelion's "open to interpretation" plot and an easy to understand plot. Holding it up to the original, it's NOT subtle in any way, shape, or form. Obviously it's more subtle than Pacific Rim or Gurren Lagann, but it lacks the meta commentary, complex characters, and even the heart of NGE. The first half completely ignores the rest of Eva and effectively resets the universe, while the second half is just a drawn-out, over-the-top version of Episode 24. Rebuild (I've dropped the 'Of Evangelion' in the hopes that it might become true) has to make up for this with 3.0+1.0 if it wants any credibility. Just watch the last three episodes and you'll be good.  














 Does the [choral section after the guitar solo](http://youtu.be/k9zcjnEyKjc?t=1m45s) have any particular lyrics or is it just vocalization? I can't find any lyrics for them, but they are consistent throughout every single cover of the song.  









 Edit: for whatever *reason*. God damnit.  







































 Space-G has to fight every single pokemon. The fight takes place in that region's city, which Space-G has made his new fortress of solitude. Which regions can he defeat? Which regions defeat him?

Note: Especially for Gen IV, we are using whichever incarnation is most reasonable for the fight (e.g. giant Groudon. but no omnipotent Arceus) 



















 After Gendo Ikari is "eaten" by a naked Unit-01 during Third Impact, his soul is added to Instrumentality. The world he exists in and refuses to return from after Giant Naked Rei is killed is the one that exists in Rebuild. The first is a complete retread of his memories, knowing what he knows he added some things from the real world (red seas, MP-Eva outline) he sees where he went wrong and could make a change in regards to Shinji, by adding a new person to the mix, namely Mari Ilustrious Makinami. The reason she's a Mary Sue is because she represents Gendo's paradise, not unlike Kaworu for Shinji. Speaking of gay alien Jesus, he remembers the original because he's an Angel, and therefore infiltrated Gendo's world, once again like for Shinji. In Gendo's perfect world, he kills SEELE, the only people who were stopping his Instrumentality scenario. Going back to EoE, in his final moments, Gendo regretted his treatment of Shinji and his last words were an apology to his son. So all the *slightly* not-as-shitty-but-still-mostly-shit that Shinji suffers through in Rebuild (not being able to see the Dummy System kill Bardiel, not killing Kaworu with his own hands, being a hero and getting the girl in 2.22, etc.) was a result of that.  




 I have a piano that I want to learn to play it on while I sing. Five seconds in Google only turned up guitar tabs and the wrong song.  














 [Here's the lyrics in both Japanese and English.](http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/neongenesisevangelion/acruelangelsthesis.htm) 




 Who takes the role of:

The Whore, The Athlete, The Fool, The Scholar, and the Virgin (work with what we have)

What horror do they summon? Are the old gods appeased?  



















 I'm a singer and I want to perform a song in the name of our Lord. Is there anything I can do without knowing how to play an instrument?

It has come to my attention that the answer is no. I'll see if I can find some free time to create some vocal music.  




 As a gift, my mom is buying me a 760, or something in that price range. I need to know what parts I should get to match, preferably around $500.  



















 **Name:** Amir Valerie Blumenfeld (also goes by "Vance", "DJ Schmumu", and various combinations of his name and "Jacob Hurwitz")

**Identification code:** 425862-JA-IIWY

**Biography:** This prisoner's past is inconsistent at best. As best we can gather, he was brought illegally from Canada to New York state, where his abusive parents raised him, teaching him to drive at 4. He was verbally and physically abused, and every time he was deemed a disappointment, his father moved houses. It is known that Amir was neighbors with a child named Penis Anthony Dooblinge (who recently changed his name to Roboert Cut off my own Penis Fatty Fatty Narr Narr Smoke A Bowl Full Of Sour Cream Veggie Burrito Penis) Amir was abducted from a shopping mall when he was six years of age and returned at the age of 11. He had forgotten how to speak and survived on a diet of chicken nuggets, a diet which still persists into his 30s. He repeated second grade an apparent total of 8 times, then managed to reach sixth grade without talking for four years, when he did eventually speak he was returned to second grade due o his illiteracy in math and English. It is unknown how much time passed before he got an internship at Collegehumor, where he still works, with no apparent job despite being employed. As a result of his upbringing, he seems to suffer from delusions of grandeur. 

**Known crimes:** Innumerable counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault, arson, prank calls to 911, attempted robbery on a subway, libel against an airline (awaiting a ruling form the jury) lying under oath, stalking, stabbing a coworker (Jake Hurwitz), several counts of animal abuse (a snake, a kidnapped dog, several animals he brutally murdered just to wear as accessories), sexual harassment, breaking and entering (at least two counts), armed robbery, destruction of property, public nudity, stealing from sleeping homeless women, assaulting police officers, and kidnapping the child of an officer. 

**Summary of capture:** A co-worker (Jake Hurwitz) alerted us about the dangerous nature of his actions and of the crimes he's committed. We waited at Jake's apartment until Amir attempted to break in, at which point we arrested him. 

**Sentence:** Amir clearly suffers symptoms of schizophrenia. He is to be given a therapist to help with his mental illness. For the crimes he has committed, he is to be given a life sentence with no probation. 

**Containment Notes:** Do not be fooled by Amir's weak, underweight body. He has more than enough strength to break out of a minimum security cell. He has the apparent ability to teleport, despite being a mortal human. He is to be locked in, with guards watching him at all times. Once his reeducation and rehabilitation are complete, he can be moved to a lower security and given probation.  




 1: a straight-up 3-way fight between them. Mothra has laid her egg and therefore can come back as two larvae if she so chooses. 

2: Who would do the best doing the other two's jobs? (ie. Aquaman vs Godzilla AND Aquaman vs pollution)

3: Who could they beat together?

4: How many Hedorahs would it take to defeat them? 
























 Baragon has apparently never won a single battle. Who's the strongest fighter he could fight in order to break his losing streak?  


































 I need to know what this looks like.  





























 The JSSDF scrapped the Jet Alone project after the episode 7 incident, and decided to instead work on a much better nuclear mecha to rival NERV's Eva-series. The JSSDF plans on raiding the Geofront using an army of Kiryus. Units 00 and 02 have been put into suspension at the time of the attack, so NERV only has Unit-01 to defend themselves. Shinji decides to stop being a bitchly and get in the fucking robot for once. 

Each Kiryu has an S^2 engine so they won't run out of power, but they still can't cast an AT field

Bonus: Could Kiryu beat one Mass Production Evangelion (who have no AT fields, but do have the heavy spear)?

Bonus II: Could one Kiryu succeed where Asuka failed and take out all the MP-Evas? The power issues Kiryu has are back for this round

Bonus III: How many Kiryus would it take to kill *every* Evangelion? Rebuild units included. That's 00, 01, 02, Bardiel, 04 (who is presumably the same as unit-02), Unit-05, Mark VI, Unit-08, Unit-09, and Unit-13 
























 [from this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNhsXnxl04w) 




 Cave Johnson has accidentally done a Second Impact. Now, because there is no Gehirn or SEELE in this world, Aperture Science has to be the ones to kill the Angels. They are also housing GLaDOS, who was built from Lilith now. If the Angels get to her, Third Impact will happen and GLaDOS will have failed. She has all the resources available in both Portal and the Half-Life games. Can she do it? Who does she use as a pilot I'd she figures out the Evangelion plans?

Things that now exist from Evangelion: AT fields, the Dead Sea Scrolls Apocrypha, the Lance of Longinus.

GLaDOS can also build Evangelions and the Positron Accelerator, but needs to research and invent them. She has 15 years after Second Impact until Sachiel attacks to build.
