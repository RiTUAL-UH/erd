 Anything that is inedible, is not really meant to be eaten or has no relation to the ingredients on the plate and which can be flicked off the plate with your thumb and finger.  Examples would be a tomato rose, a flower or a sprig of herb that is not used in the dish.
 




 .......and they probably speak English better than some here.  Hopefully they don't learn English from some of our videos that promote slang.  




 WUT?!!!   




 I've heard that there are more people in China that can speak and write English then in America. BTW, my mom couldn't understand Chinese but she recognized their language. 




 lol 




 This was my mom's experience not mine.  I'm sure she knew how to use it but knowing her quirks she was just interested in why the instructions were so long.  Maybe there was some ancient Chinese wisdom that said one should Never Ever use Tiger Balm on specific sore places! 




 Mom told it better than I can.  She had a great sense of humor.  




 I got the impression they knew exactly what they were doing and probably had a great laugh over it later!  




 How do you figure that?  As far as I know he never married, hung out with 12 other guys whom he encouraged to leave their families just for him and I don't recall him saying anything about gays explicitly.   




 My uncle is this sloth's long lost twin brother! 




 Thanks!  I'm assuming I should work bottom to top and use odd numbers. 




 Awesome!  I'm in culinary school and my instructors wont allow us to use garnishes that are "flickable" for plating such as a tomato rose however, I'm now planning to use the strawberry rose as anyone would eat that!  Any tips? 




 My mother and cousin were in CA on vacation.  Mom's back was sore/stiff from driving so she bought some Tiger Balm however, all the instructions were in Chinese which she didn't understand.  She spots this elderly Chinese couple and approaches them to ask if they could read to her what the instructions said.  The elderly woman takes the instructions, looks it over and smilingly broadly says yes.  She then starts to slowly explain in Chinese what the instruction says looking up occasionally to make sure they are listening or sometimes pointing out something on the instructions and nodding her head to make sure they understood. She and her husband did this with a serious, straight face the whole time. She hands the instructions back to my Mom.  My mother politely thanks her the she and her husband walk away without saying a word.       




 From someone really old (meaning before cellphones, digital cameras, the Internet and accompanying social media) we had to physically meetup with our friends.  That meant actually leaving our house!  Of course it also meant, for some activities you had to travel a significant distance. 

That leads me to the first thing to be cool.  A driver's license.  After that if you were really cool you may have had your own car!  Of course you couldn't show off said car without Facebook so you had to do the the next best thing which was the second coolest thing.

Cruising the lake, beach or local drag on Friday or Saturday was the standard.  Drive-ins were also acceptable but you couldn't blare your favorite cassette featuring AC/DC, Duran Duran, or Cars to name but a few. 

Cheap alcohol, pot and maybe microdot were acceptable but anything harder then that, then you were considered a freak or druggie to be avoided.  

I have to add this, getting knocked up or getting a girl pregnant was not seen as cool or some sort of achievement.    




 Your dad has some mad talent.  As someone who is familiar with koi, the markings aren't so great.  Pretty but not what koi dealers look for.  If he studied up the subject he may appeal to more koi enthusiasts. As for me, I'd love to buy a painting! 




 Now if only the average US female marine could do that! 




 and we pay no state income taxes with only a modest sales tax of 7.25%. 




 Winnsboro, Tx, just a tiny spot in the piney woods of east Texas 




 No 




 $235,000 or so 




 When I was a server, it was assumed I made 15% from the $'s that I sold and my earnings were reported as income to the IRS whether I received 15% or not.  What I didn't know then is that, as a hourly paid employee who is paid less than minimum wage as most of us are, if our tips don't combine to equal minimum wage then the employer must make up the difference.  

So lets say you're on the clock as a server and no one comes into the restaurant the entire time you've been hired to provide wait-staffing duties.  You are paid $2.86 per hour to be there and you stay there the entire time but never encounter a customer.  The restaurant has to pay minimum wage, $5.75 in some states to make up for their lack of customers while you're on the clock.  This is a little known secret that most places don't want servers to know about. 




 If it were some of the people I worked with, they would have ripped open the front of the Shiner case and taken out bottles from the middle hoping the ones on the outside plus the cardboard would be sufficient to hold up the rest the cases. 




 Worked in a plant nursery where people would bring in leaves and ask why they were turning brown.  "It's fall" 




 My brother gave me this album for X-Mass.  Always enjoyed it and have never came across anyone who knew who they were. Thanks. 




 Todd Rundgren,  "Hello it's me" was for the masses but the album, "A wizard, A Star" decidedly was not and I love it to this day! 




 This is why everyone should know how to tell how long ago a tire was manufactured.  Rubber degenerates. Many "new" tires sold are up to two years old if not older in some unscrupulous stores.   




 Tootie, I'm sure that your grandma can tell you about her discovery 




 and clitoral ripples! 




 As someone that worked at a high end hotel in a major metropolis in the US I can verify that Saudi guests are the most demanding (wanting lamb at 2 am) and the most obnoxious and sexist A-holes I've ever dealt with.  I guess they suffer from Affluenza too! 




 I've always thought that Jimmy Carter, while handed a s**t sandwich, handled the Iran situation well.  He had the stones to refuse to negotiate with terrorists unlike Reagan who traded arms for hostages.  He may not be the most celebrated president but he is undoubtedly the most post-executive selfless serving president of all.    




 I'm confused, I thought the holy trinity was onions, bell peppers, and celery. 




 No 




 I think you're confusing celebration with endorsement neither of which apply to US discrimination laws concerning business practices.  

If I provide a cake for a 10 year olds' birthday I'm neither celebrating nor endorsing the birthday.  I may sincerely believe that his age should include the 9 months of gestation before birth as some cultures do but that's not my place.  I sell cakes and because I choose to sell them to the public in the US I have to adhere to non-discriminationary laws.

Your examples of the photographer fail.  Unless you have the photographer give a thumbs-up in a photo or force a personal statement of endorsement of the marriage you don't have a claim of a  violation of your personal beliefs. Just photographing the event is not an endorsement.

As far as your silly comment about atheist, we absolutely don't borrow Christian morality as our world view.  We reject Christian morality with all its hypocrisy. To most atheist, Christian morality is an oxymoron. 

 The arrogant attitude that Christians hold themselves to concerning their monopoly on morality is laughable at best. 




 I'm not talking about individuals.  Many individuals from many religions are critical thinkers in their respective fields.  

I'm referring to a religions capacity from their own tenets to be able to allow or even encourage critical analysis of itself.  The only religion that comes to mind that even comes close to is certain sects of Buddhism. All the other major religions from history and my experience would be perfectly happy to not have their followers be exposed to other religions or people with no religion.  More than just a few bad apples.  Do you remember reading about the Inquisition?  Are you aware of the religious freedoms denied in other countries?   




 I'd probably guess the later however good luck to you both! 




 You need the disclaimer, "Don't try this at home" or you'll have guys showing up at the hospital with super glue shoved into their dicks.  




 YET! 




 My son's astrolabe. 




 Although they both seek answers to basic questions concerning life they are inherently different. Philosophy is always based on critical thinking and wisdom.  Religions are not and most are actively apposed to critical analysis. 




 I meant he was resurrected or raised from the state of death.  So therefore, while he may have physically died for a brief time he was brought back to life.   




 I'm not sure about the hell and back thing.  Where does it say that he went to hell after he "died"?  Either way, since he was resurrected and then ascended into heaven what, if anything was sacrificed and if so, by whom? 




 The problem I have with this is Jesus ultimately did not die so there was no sacrifice.   




 Most likely almond tuiles. 




 I  imagine that after the pearl broke the bottom part of the shell would hold the sauce for dipping. 




 The "pearl" is probably a chocolate sauce but it can be made with many types of liquid.  The technique is called spherification using molecular gastronomy.  Basically sodium alginate is mixed with the liquid, then dropped into a calcium chloride bath by the spoon full.  This causes a "membrane" to form which holds the chocolate in a sphere shape.
Cool huh?  




 It's not crazy at all and almost all European Christians understand this but unfortunately many American Christian theologians want the Bible to explain the history and origin of life and they will stop short of nothing to to advance their views regardless of all scientific evidence that shows the Bible is wrong on this subject

 




 Kangaroos were in the middle east?  Is there evidence of that? 




 Why are you Christian?, birth or choice? 




 Are you kidding me?  Seriously? 




 For the most part no.  




 Paul's teaching did not come first.  Jesus's teachings did and overrode many things anything Paul proposed later.  The break came because of the lineage of Jesus's bloodline vs the apostles and their authority over the early Christians.  It was basically a power-struggle.  No big whoop here but A big whoop then! 




 The common disputes are over land, wealth, and political control.  The use of religion as an excuse to justify horrific methods to obtain these ends is both ancient and contemporary and is always used to appeal to common people.  Rarely has a religion grown and thrived without the support of government.  This is why some American Christians are threated and lashing out against perceived prosecutions against them.  

Their dominance is quickly eroding and they know that the US Constitution does not support their former favored status.  Neither do our laws or legal agencies concerning discrimination.

  Demographics don't lie.  Religion in it's former state has a new wrapper and it's not supported by any political group as our founding fathers wanted it.  We are a diverse group.  If you want to belong here then you must give anyone from a religion different from yours complete rights to disagree but no right takes away what are basic human rights even if your religion disagrees.   




 "Have some respect for yourself and date your own species"

Where the fuck did you attend college where they taught that other races like blacks and asians were a separate species from whites?   




 That's the problem. They don't. 
 They only have some governmental pinheads in Saudi and some others in the Middle East that dictate what is and isn't acceptable.  They're are none more eligible to dictate what is right or wrong then my cat.
  Normal Muslims are mostly afraid of the bullies that have invaded the West but I'm not.  If you're listening you cowards and fools, I'm right here in Texas and can't wait.  Best wishes to my real Muslim friends!   




 Yea, I find it bizarre that all the animals got along in Eden but had to start killing and eating each other because of "the Fall of Man". 




 Congratulations, you have just summed up the Patriarchal view.  Until you grow old enough to worship Me and respect Me as your Father I have no use for you.

Matriarchal view.  I will love and protect you while you can't protect yourself.  As you grow I will try to guide you and when you are strong enough you will go out and live a good life. 
Hopefully you'll remember to call me every other weekend.   




 I also think I'm lucky to have been born as an intelligent animal in a country and at a time when expressing my opinions won't be a death sentence! 
 
I believe that the average human commits hundreds of acts of kindness toward fellow humans, animals, and sometimes even the environment everyday.  We do this even if its not convenient, necessary,  beneficial to us or in extreme cases may endanger ourselves.  I believe this is the natural human condition and those that prey on others are in the small minority but cause the vast majority of unnecessary pain and suffering by choosing greed, be it power, fame, control or security because they lack a fundamental connection with humanity.  Sad. 

  To me suffering is a part of life just like death and both are part of the natural world.  What is considered cruel in nature is only a human construct.  Only humans inflict cruelty on each other when they don't need to.  I "think" my cat is being cruel by "playing" with an insect or mouse before he kills it but is he?  Maybe he is perfecting some hunting skill or making sure he won't get stung or bitten.

I know for sure I don't know for sure why my fellow Earthmates do what they do so I'll hold my human-centric judgment on my cat and dolphins for now.  Then again I doubt they give a shit! LOL          




 You made my point and yours.  God's existence can't be proved by perfection.  There is no perfection in nature, only adaptation to available opportunities.  What we think of as cruel in nature when compared to human actions is begging the wrong question. If perfection existed then we wouldn't be having this discussion.

Humans might think the blue-footed boobie is "heartless" when she won't let won't own offspring back into the nest after it falls out or is pushed out by a sibling but I believe it's wrong to place human emotions or judgments on animals.  

I don't think the insect that lays her eggs in the abdomen of another species that in turn eats it way out of it's host is anymore evil then dolphins or hyena's that "rape" each other.  Rather than being pointless, it has lead to the survival of many species.  This doesn't mean human behavior follows suit since we have developed the capacity for long-term consequences.  




 I would hazard a guess but when innocent people are hurt or killed because you gave that person free will just in order to test their devotion to you.....that is evil.  

 




 Would you not agree that the natural world is not evil?  Suffering is a part of nature but unnecessary suffering occurs because of someone's greed.  




 It says He deceived them which is lying.  




 I would say that the struggle for life among animals is amoral and not evil.  Evil, as defined in the bible, is knowing right from wrong but conscientiously choosing wrong.   




 Here comes the textual argument.  I have, have you?  I was confirmed in the church and after finally reading the bible thoroughly and not just what was picked out for me I understood what they were trying to shield me from.   




 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.

Isaiah 45:7

If He doesn't DO evil he damn sure created it which is worse, IMO. 




 Why then does he do it by proxy?  Ezekial 14:9 and 2 Thessalonians 2:11 




 Where does it say in the bible God can't do evil or lie? 




 I haven't ignored you Furo Ergo Sum.  I've been involved with life's distractions otherwise known as reality.  Forgive me.

What I meant my your prejudices is the resistance by you to acknowledge the basic female or baseline development of many organisms.  

Not all animals reproduce sexually.  Some animals such as Aphids that normally reproduce sexually will reproduce asexually through the mother producing only daughters and will only produce males during certain citations.  I can think of no instance when a male organism has ever been able to reproduce asexually.  I'm not saying males are irrelevant in our species but they aren't the go-to sex biologically.

Whether or not you think Jost's experiments mean anything is irrelevant.  Science did and does appreciate his contribution to the understanding of embryology.  You have missed the point. 

I'll try one more time.

For people to get the traits encoded in their genes, the genes need to be turned on. You can think of a gene as a recipe. A recipe in a cookbook does you no good until you open the book, get the ingredients and follow the instructions

The same is true with our genes. In our analogy, the gene is the recipe and the cookbook is the chromosome (a large collection of recipes). The gene needs to be "read" by the cell in order for it to do what it should.  However, the gene may be misread or the chromosomes are faulty. 

By studying why chromosomes/genes act why they do, medical science hopes to understand other medical diseases.

When you add the influence of hormones to the genes it becomes really complicated. 

 




 There was a Seinfeld episode on this as was other little niggling petpeaves on the show. I recall it had to do with the " Bubble Boy" and Jerry trying to follow George down the Parkway.  

Was Jerry driving too slow or was George driving too fast?   Maybe, maybe not.  All I know is I got to use the word niggling in context.   




 Two packaged boiled and peeled eggs.   




 "Methinks you do protest too much!" and with so much mindless moronic cussing and bold face type to try and bolster your points;  you come off as defensive.  I take your response, "who cares" telling.  Obviously you do so and in a big phallic way!  

The original discussion began in an attempt to reconcile genesis with biology and why the bible asserted women came from men and not the other "natural" way around.  You have outed your prejudices by denying the science you claim you aspire a degree in.  Good luck with that young student.

 




 Actually it's the number of old people having sex. 




 I agree with you that it happens not only to teens but way into adulthood also but you don't need to be mean to discover your own self-worth.  It's never justified either in childhood or adulthood. 




 Your assertion that male and female tissues develop in tandem and that only the external genitalia remains ambiguous is wrong (typical guy, only concerned on what's on the outside lol!).  

The Wolffian ducts develops 2 weeks before the Mullarian ducts.  Males will lose all remnants of the M ducts and females will eventually lose the W duct itself but not its undifferentiated gonad.  Those become the ovaries. Without the interference of testosterone and a antiMullarian hormone from the testis the fetus will continue on to develop as a female.  Males will develop their penis and scrotum from what would have become the clitoris and labia folds.

Perhaps during the course of your "studies" you will come across the work of Professor Alfred Jost, a French endocrinologist.  His experiments with rabbits proved that if you removed the undifferentiated gonads the animal will default (his words, not mine) to the female sex.  

After the holiday break go back to school and learn the difference between sex determination, sex differentiation and undifferentiated tissue.  Hopefully then all this will all make sense to you.  If not just ask your professor or better yet, spend hours contemplating your own nipples.  Happy New Year!   




 The cop told me to reschedule my court date and said if he doesn't show up the ticket has to be dismissed if I plead not guilty.  

Turns out if you live in a big city and you reschedule the issuing officer will either not be notified in time or will not be able to be present.  That being said it may just be a Texas law that the officer must be present and it definitively won't work in a small town.      




 Right after 911 when I was in the military I was pulled over in a school zone along with several other cars.  He walked down the line taking our license plates numbers then came up to us individually for our DL and registration.  When he came to me and found out I was military he mumbled, "You have better things to do" and told me how to beat the ticket even though he had to write it.  

It worked and has worked every time I've received any kind of moving violation. 




 Okay, I'll play.  At conception, the zygote has sex chromes that are either XX(female) or XY(male). The mother's egg always gives X but the father's sperm determines the extra X or Y which determines the potential sex of the child.  Sometimes, as in the case with all sexual dimorphism, there will be anomalies such as males having XXY, XXYY or females with only X.  Most will present as males having female attributes due to the lack of the dominate influence of testosterone from the developing organs and the hormonal influence.  

Genes not only determine the sex but they play a part in determining when hormones turn of and on and subsequently how further developments happen.  It's not written in stone guys but it's incrementally important.  

Even the emotional state of the mother can influence production of hormones that can have an effect on her baby.
  




 I doubt you could even make one coherent argument to challenge this opinion.    




 Infuriating isn't it.  I do have one correction for Paxalot.  Although female is the default mode until genes and hormones come into play, the zygote and subsequent fetus aren't really female or male but have the potential for both.  If you must rely on genes themselves it's telling that males are one chromosome off from females and not the other way around. Few die-hard misogynists will even acknowledge the science of embryology like some congress"men" from my state!  

The point though is even with our scientific understanding why do some people subscribe to an ancient mythology that reduces the importance of females and consequently subjugates them to males?    




 Ignorance is understandable.  Willful ignorance is just sad and pathetic.  




 A lot of people think "heroin addict" and just don't get it.  Lots of riders live normal lives as long as they can stave off the withdraw.  You don't get high, you just don't get sick.  Still it's a pretty shitty existance.   




 Pretty much most of my family was/is sociopathic, addicted or manipulative but I've mostly known this since I was a teenager.

That said, the only person in my inner circle that turned out to be really, really bad was my brother-in law.  

I first met him when I was pregnant in the mid nineties.  He had married a woman with a young daughter and she was pregnant with their child.  They had bought a house and seemed happy and normal.  A year later we stayed for a couple of nights with them during vacation.
Never saw anything out of the normal.  He maybe drank a little too much but nothing out of the ordinary for a southern redneck IYNWIM!

After some years they divorced as did I so I only followed my BIL through my ex and son.  Turns out he had a pretty serious drinking problem and eventually spent time in a state prison for a felony DUI where they took his DNA which is standard procedure.

Turns out his DNA turns up as a match for a murder that was nearly 20 old in another state.  The case was featured on TV for unsolved murders.  In short, a mother of two who worked as a dancer at a strip club was found murdered by her two young kids and the babysitter in her trailerhouse two years before I met him. 

An investigation followed and he confessed to her murder.  He's still awaiting trial.  

It still creeps me out that I stayed in the same house with a murderer with my newborn and that my kid grew up around him.    




 I'm not particularly good at rap or poetry so I'll give you my best suggestion.  

You've made millions promoting a thug lifestyle that influenced countless impressionable kids to embrace morals that weren't exactly beneficial to them.  You then had kids of your own and changed your song.  Good for you.  Glad you realized the impression media has on youth.

IMHO, you should rap about being the Scrooge, what with the negative attitude toward the police and then make a video of you rapping about how the police can be your friend and school is cool.

You asked, just sayin'

Good speed to you and your campaign.   




 DamnitGoose now the long needle dicks will feel inadaquate! 




 This is why girls are bad at math! 




 Almost!  My SO was tending a fire and some embers landed on the carpet in front of the hearth and he was so consumed with the fire that he didn't know that our carpet had caught fire.  I put it put with his beer.  




 I'm going to do this and film the results. 
 




 It was only the towels and matches but the worst was the toothpaste in the carpet 




 Even with gas it takes forever to get dry wood to burn. 




 We lost the Scopes Trial just like Evolutionists wanted.  We wanted to take it to the Supreme Court but the judge, just like a sidewinder, devised a way to prevent it by knowingly setting the fine himself to $100 instead of the jury which was supposed to be under $50 and so under the law the verdict was thrown out along with any chance of appeal.  Never underestimate your opponent no matter how misguided. 




 Unless you've been raised in this religion it seems strange the a God has to sacrifice his godson's life to absolve humans of their failings that the Christian god knew would happen in the first place.  What can be gained by having someone else suffer except a sense of guilt.  
  According to the Jews, the real Messiah was not to be the sacrificial lamb that leads to heaven.  The Jewish religion proscribes no heaven nor hell.  The messiah was to lead the Jews from persecution to a peaceful reign of the Jews over this world.  The big change from Judaism to Christianity and Muslim was this point.  Xtians and Muslims focus on a reward in an afterlife and Jews are about a reward in this life.
  Get it?  Got it?   Duh!!!! 




 Listen to the song first. 









 I'll try. A sacrifice means that what you gave can never be returned. Period.  Final.  God never sacrificed his son because he was reincarnated and lives forever within His houses.   




 No, no you don't, at least not in Fort Worth, Texas.   




 Good grief!  Get over the idea that music, art, or even culinary expressions can't be expressed and enjoyed by people of all faiths.

I'm atheist and I love gospel music, the paintings of the ideologues of the Greek Orthodox church, and hot-cross buns.  

Worship is one thing....appreciation is another. 




 Do you really believe that your product is that good?  I mean do you stand behind all the company hype?  I ask this because they have moved into burger heaven areas and after the newness rubs off, all that's left is well a good but not great burger. 




 A better question is why are some Christians obsessed with Biblical literalism especially when it comes to forcing their own views down the throats of American public school children. 
  
  As an atheist, I don't have any problem with an American Indian believing that a tarantula created the earth or any of the other 4,000 or so Creation stories.  Why should I?  Everyone has an opinion and I, as a veteran, defended their ability to hold and cherish them whether right or wrong.

  What I and others have a problem with is when a faction of this country seeks to demand that their religion is supreme above all.  They declare that the majority of our forefathers were Christians so that means we are a Christian nation.  The fact that the majority were Christians doesn't mean their intentions were to make this country's government tied to Christianity in anyway shape or form.  Let me say this again,  The fact that the majority were Christians doesn't mean their intentions were to make this country's government tied to Christianity in anyway shape or form.

Get it?,  Got it?,  Good!

No one is trying to take away any of your rights! Believe what you want, we just don't want taxpayer's money paying for religious symbols for select Americans and unless you want the idea of an intelligent  God-tarantula being taught then let the public schools stick with strict math and science sans the ID stuff. 

Sorry but there's no geological evidence of any world-wide flood but it's not surprising that cultures all over the world can relate to a flood since they happen everywhere.  At least that's what my insurance agent told me lol. 




 You are pretty fucking stupid and don't deserve any disability from SS and if your Ins. paid then you should pay them back for your own stupidity.  Sorry about your crappy looking toes but it doesn't beat my uncle when he raised up the running lawnmower and sliced of several of the tips of his fingers.  You both belong in a pile of morons and drive up the cost of insurance! 




 Owls?  I love owls.  Owls love to eat.  Owls love to eat rodents.  Owls also love to eat a small rodent like Chihuahua dog that lives next door that likes to yip and bark for hours on end.  Yea owls!  I love owls.  And hawks, vultures, ect.  Did I say I love owls? 




 As I load their bags with candy I think I'll whisper, "In Satan's name.". LOL 




 Prayer, in its simplest form that I was taught as a child is NOT asking  God or Jesus any help for me or anyone else. Prayer is not to ask for special favors even when you want something that you think is special.

Praying is only to acknowledge, reflect and confirm your faith in Jesus and not some magical path for health or prosperity for you or your family to (lose) pay money into.
 Please don't be mislead!
If even two people pay attention to me and recognize not only the religious scams churches use, but they will enlist your help to place your elderly parents or relative in a substandard retirement home where they receive kickbacks. Sounds lovely?! Don't bet on any of it.  They will take your money and spend it on new golf clubs before the ink is signed on your parents contract! 




 The gospels provide clues to the life of Jesus but the actual life and death of Jesus was never and has never been corroborated by any outside sources including the Romans' that had this habit of recording everything that they could. 




 I won't say that this film was misunderstood as the film didn't reflect the original story but the damage was done to the collective conscience of the viewing public and the original story was lost.  I refer to the original "Frankenstein".

The movie made the story out to be a cautionary tale about the evils and limits of scientific exploration, portraying the monster as a non-verbal, grunting, sub-human. The book, in fact, portrays the monster helping an unknowing family and learns how to communicate in French. Later, he gives a touching soliloquy to his maker that turned his back on him.  

The book was not a tale of science over-extending itself but a commentary of how a society can turn a person with potential empathy and intelligence into what they define is a monster.  The latter being much more scary and relevant to modern society!  




 "Death is from sin nature"

The idea of original sin has been a sticking point for me since I was a child.  To conscientiously punish the progeny for a mistake their parents made is akin to justifying a caste system.  Your parents screwed up so I'm gonna make your existence while you're alive almost unbearable but if you praise me enough I'll reward you after I let you die which I don't have to do but because your parents disobeyed me, who didn't know any better because I never taught them what disobedience meant because I didn't want them to know any better. This made no sense to the naive 10 year old me then it does now.

My great-grandfather was a Baptist preacher. I was confirmed into the Episcopalian Church at age 10 and have been studying various religions including Christianity for the past 40 years.  Some things have become clear to me concerning Christianity.

A great deal of guilt is laid on Christian children just for being born. They are told that because of original sin sex is bad but necessary and even their future death is also because of sin.  All this adds up to atonements, offerings, sacrifices to the priests that can direct them to a way to escape death and live forever, (which as far as I know, no one has been able to do) and makes the priests, reverends, popes etc., rich while robbing the hopeful yet gullible. 
  
The sad thing is that while pinning their hopes on an "afterlife" they neglect and dismiss a precious opportunity of self-conscientiousness that is the rare occurrence of life. 

Instead of embracing and cherishing what they have, they claim that this fragile life on this fragile planet means nothing.

You talk about moral absolutes and call me a hypocrite but all I know is that I only have this life as a human on this planet and I will cherish and help future life here as long as it lasts.

Death is the rebirth of life and it's natural and OK!
    




 What?  I've been drinking straight from the cartons since I was I kid. Oh no, suddenly I feel sic..... 




 Who Louis Armstrong was.  When I was stationed in New Orleans I found out that my boyfriend, who was from Pittsburg, PA didn't know who he was even though the airport there is named after him. He had been there for over three years.  It's a wonderful world! 




 It does and I can understand your dilemma.  I apologize for some of the conclusions I jumped to.

I had to pull some strings to get stationed where my parents were.  My 4'3" mother had to have a double hernia surgery from lifting my 6'2" step-dad after his heart surgery and stroke and they needed my help.  After I got there I found out that they owed the IRS $6500 or they would lose their house.  I took out a loan and paid the IRS. I stayed there for another year rent free to recoup the loan.  I thought about buying the house but because of foundation problems I decided not to. 

They eventually settled on a reverse mortgage which worked out well.

However, I did this with an income of around $43,000.  How you bought a $180,000 home on an income of only 18k at the time or even 25k makes anyone wonder. 

Good on ya and at least, even if it's an after thought, you are  taking care or advantage of your relatives. 

Good luck to you sir! 
 




 "Its my dad's place. he was not well so I came back and am helping with everything. sister moved back in and mom was losing her place (they are divorced but its friendly) so she moved in too."

So you came back to your dad's place to help by having him move in with you? You're not being coherent.  




 Just responding to your response actually concerning the house.  It was you that indicated the house was still owned by your father. JS 




 Jesmay, have you ever really read the bible cover to cover on your own without someone there to interpret it for you?  No matter, I have and I will give you just one passage:

Isaiah 13:15-18 NLT

Bueno noches! 




 Once again, since you aren't legally responsible to pay the property and school tax for your parents, it doesn't count as your tax burden for the purpose of your argument.  When I agreed to pay my parents' property tax it was only to help them; the same as if I paid their electric bill, bought a new AC unit for their home, or even sent them on their dream vacation to Italy.  I still paid my own taxes and because it wasn't my home I couldn't write off or apply my VA disability discount on my federal returns. 

It's nice that you're "helping" your parents but it sounds like you are definitely receiving a benefit here because you're not paying rent.  Having lived in PA I know that $7612 a year would be considered pretty cheap rent for for renting a house that size.  Also it's interesting that you collect the rental income from a property you don't own and report that as personal income.  

Sounds like you have positioned yourself into a comfortable situation where you can live rent free on only 18k plus; supplementing your income by renting rooms in your parents house to other relatives.  

Good job! You still misrepresented yourself, have offered no argument about the ACA and have shown yourself to be a opportunistic moocher and family blood-sucker.  Did it ever occur to you that when they leave/or die it may not be yours?  Maybe so but from what I gather you've probably made sure the will is in order to your benefit.

This sounds like a clear -cut case of elder abuse to me!
