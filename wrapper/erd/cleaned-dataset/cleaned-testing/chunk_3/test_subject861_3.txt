 I just woke up and remembered I wrote this late last night. At the time, I thought it was a good idea. What was I thinking? 

That being said, I've got part two to work on...  




 ###**The Battle for Bombing Run**
***
Captain Crimson wiped the dried spittle from his mouth with the back of his dirty hand. A cardinal chirped in the distance. The melodic song rang out sharply against the bleak backdrop of the battle at hand.  
  
Crimson and his team of three had been immersed into a serious battle for the past eleven hours. He knew that the final hour would determine the fate of his crew. Sergeant Jasper was Crimson's right-hand man. Jasper was a faithful patriot; one that had worked hard to achieve his position. Though, he had willingly trampled over many to get to where he was. There was also Poppy, an older man whom everyone respected and revered. No one knew his birth name. Due to his age and fatherly appeal, others started calling him Poppy. It picked up quickly. Esbe Juan was the final member of the bunch. His motives rarely clear and his actions always unexpected, Esbe held the lowest rank of the bunch; Private First Class. The cadre of four had been through a lot together. This was just another page in the expanding catalog of lessons learned.

"We're marooned!" yelled Esbe. "Absolutely stranded! There's nothing we can do to win this battle. We've got to lay down our arms; live to fight another day."

"There will not be another day, Private!" Poppy barked. "*This* is our day to win. I'd rather die than forfeit." 

Jasper didn't speak. He was deep in thought, pensive, looking out over the battlefield. He couldn't see clearly through the spike sector, but knew that on the other side stood a team of four re-positioning for the final attack.

"Here's the plan," said Captain Crimson. The others gathered around. "Poppy, as always, I want you to provide an impenetrable wall. Do not let anyone through, you understand me?" The old man nodded his head as he unwittingly tugged at his wispy white beard. 

"Esbe," the Captain continued, "you stay with Poppy. Do whatever he says the moment he speaks. Protect our...Esbe...Esbe!" 

Esbe apologized as he returned to the circle. As the Captain was speaking, Esbe had wandered off to the side to admire a rock.

"I've got it," Esbe confirmed. "I'm following you to the enemy's base."

Jasper hit Esbe in the back of the head. The Captain shook his head in disgust, but maintained his cool composure. "No Esbe. Just no. Do the opposite of what you just said and you'll be on the right track." 

Captain Crimson looked out over the horizon. "There are only two ways to get to the prize. Jasper, you take the south path. I'll take north. I would advise against pursuing the ammunition in the middle of the spike sector. I think it's a trap. There might be mines or bombs hidden in the ground. It's just not worth it."

Jasper blinked his agreement. "I'll go south, trying my best to take a speed pad for a quicker arrival. We reconvene on the other side?"

"Yes, Sergeant," Crimson said. "If we attack from opposite directions at varying speeds, I think we will throw them off, providing us with a small window to grab the prize and return home." 

They all knew what the prize was. The enemy's glorious flag was the treasure that would end this battle in their favor. The score was two all. This final hour would consume the lives of one team, leaving the other as victors.

Captain Crimson looked at his ragtag group of soldiers. They'd do just fine, he hoped. 

"It's time," he said, looking one last time at the ominous battlefield in front of him.

"Roll out!"

*To be continued.*

 Theologians differ on this point. The Bible doesn't speak to the subject specifically. However, Genesis 6:3 might be referencing the reversal of long life by God saying, "My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years."

When man and woman were originally created, they were done so perfectly. No sin equals no sickness. The punishment of sin was death, but it came slowly and gradually sped up as new generations came. 

The expansion of sin in our world today gives us less and less years to live. That is why it is important to realize that *now* is the day of salvation (2 Cor. 6:2). 




 Woet just kept coming into my test map games, using up the speed pads, blowing the bombs, taking the flag, and scoring. Woet... 




 I imagine that halfway through the game the other team just stopped and sat in base. "It's not worth it guys. Let's just let him have his fun. It'll all be over soon." 




 Also, there is a guy on the other team named **Butt Blood**. So...there's that. 




 This. 




 I'm not sure this is a good thing.  




 Also, if you are NOT going to pull a punch, that means you ARE going to hit hard. Pulling a punch means that you will be reserved.

Pack a punch means you are going to hit hard. If you are NOT going to hit hard, then...why the throwaway? I so confused... 




 We need movies that aren't "Christian movies", but that are made by Christians. I am sick and tired of believers thinking that there are such genres as Christian music, Christian television, or Christian movies. It appears that it is mainly in the art world. I think we've got it wrong.

A Christian message isn't always the gospel step by step. *The* Christian message is redemption, and that can be shared a number of ways. It doesn't have to be a song quoting John 3:16. It can be a song about hope, joy, and love, and accomplish more. Same goes for a movie. We are doing more damage making and supporting movies like God's Not Dead. Wake up Church. 




 So...if you were going to "pack punches" you would have used your primary account?  




 I like this. Not that I'm trying to get to the top of the leaderboard or anything....

EDT...EST...STD...whatever. 




 I'm playing a free online competitive game called **TagPro**. 

I know it's been mentioned before, but it is a great game. It is still a new game; in its birthing stages. It is simple in style and gameplay. Think capture the flag, but as rolling balls with spikes and bombs. If you aren't playing yet, or haven't even given it a try, do a quick Google search for TagPro and play a game or two. See how addicting it becomes.

Mine was a few seconds longer, but I managed to capture twice. 




 Wow. Great stuff. Saved to view after work. 

Check out this in-depth guide by /u/nivarius for strategy and map specifics! 




 The guillotine. Do you people understand? Do you even freakin' understand?  




 ^Legal ^Disclaimer: ^A ^lot ^of ^this ^information ^has ^been ^said ^before. ^I ^am ^not ^your ^definitive ^one ^stop ^shop ^for ^all ^things ^TagPro. ^This ^is ^merely ^observed ^advice. ^Additionally, ^you ^should ^seek ^the ^services ^of ^a ^confident ^professional.

Hello friends and family. I thought I'd start a semi-regular (not weekly) post attempting to cover some TagPro material from unique angles. These *will not* be advanced skills and techniques guides. There are plenty of those which can be found [here in the Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_skills_and_techniques). These *will*, however, be quick articles meant to encourage and instruct players on how to become better at TagPro. 
***
I want to start by answering a very simple question: **How can I become a better player?** 

Here are 10 easy steps to follow to begin the process of becoming a better player:

1. **Listen to constructive criticism.** There are a lot of mean people with dirty mouths. But there are also a lot of nice people with dirty mouths. Listen to the nice people. I've been in many games where more skilled players than I gave helpful advice during or after the game. Don't take this for granted.

1. **Pick a role and excel at it.** You can play both offensive and defense, but few people play both extremely well. Find out what you're best at and stick to it. Not everyone needs to be the offensive "hero". When there are too many running in for the enemy's flag, there is no one left at your base to defend. Likewise, if everyone is on defense, you'll never score.

1. **Be flexible.** While you do want to have a role your best at, be willing to play the opposite role for a game or two. Usually the best strategy is two on offense/two on defense. If someone on your team is dead set on playing O, be willing to roll D for a game for the sake of the team.

1. **Don't play for the score.** Many beginners think that the score displayed at the end of a game determines who is the best. This is simply not true. In a game, focus on helping your team win. Sometimes this will translate to the scoreboard. Sometimes it will not. TagPro is a team game and really shines when players work together and make it a team effort, win or lose.

1. **Be skeptical of speed pads/boosts.** I'm not saying don't use them. Just be wary. They can be used purposefully and with great results. But they can often leave you with the opposite intended effect. 

1. **Learn how to best use power-ups.** Believe it or not, power-ups are powerful. The Wiki contains a [power-up section](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_power-ups) that aptly describes each ability. /u/GekkoPie also created a wonderful [beginner's guide to using power-ups](http://imgur.com/a/n2usj) efficiently. Learn how to use them and then go for them whenever they spawn. In the right hands serving the right purpose, they help your team more than you know.

1. **Learn the maps.** When you are randomly thrown into a new map, roll around and figure out its layout. There might just be hidden areas or nice traps that you can utilize to your advantage. Click to view the [current rotation of maps](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_current_rotation).

1. **Learn the lingo.** GG, MB, and NP mean nothing unless you know the language being spoken. The Wiki contains a great section on [Chat Abbreviations](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/glossary#wiki_chat_abbreviations) so you can be [abreast](http://thegaily.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/006HeartBoobies_V1_W-2.jpg) of quick communication tactics while in game. 

1. **Play a pick-up game.** I just recently [wrote an article](http://redd.it/20wvjq) on how to join PUG games through Mumble. There is a [Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_mumble) and other great posts on the subject as well. One of the main things that helped with my TagPro game was to get out of community games and play with skilled players via Mumble.

1. **Practice the Golden Rule.** Treat others the way that you would like to be treated. Be nice. Be helpful. Be respectful. I know that TagPro is a competitive game that can quickly get heated. I know it is incredibly frustrating to feel like you are awesome and your team is the worst. But we are trying to build a healthy, fun, and friendly community. You can help with this. Don't detract from the hard work that many have put into building this game and community. Treat others the way that you would like to be treated.

Hope this helps us all become better players. Do you have any comments or ideas of what could be added to this list? 

*P.S. I'd love suggestions for future posts if you have any. Message me.* 




 Edited a bit so it is more general rather than just for U.S. Why can't the Americans get it together? 




 Was able to do a write up. Hope it helps guys. 

http://redd.it/20wvjq 




 I probably should add a single line for this. Don't want to go into detail over Mumble tactics, as there are already posts concerning that.  




 ^FYI: ^This ^will ^be ^a ^quick ^walkthrough ^of ^using ^Mumble ^for ^the ^first ^time. ^It ^will ^not ^be ^a ^comprehensive ^ins-and-outs ^of ^Mumble ^guide.

For some, Mumble is an intimidating place to go and try to get involved in. It is much easier to go to the [TagPro Website](http://tagpro-origin.koalabeast.com/), log in, and then click "Play Now" (and believe me, there is no ceremony, you can jump right in). True, you might get called a n00b. Certainly, you might run into the same spike twelve times and cost your team the game. Absolutely, your mother might be called a whore. But these are all risks that you are willing to take because, after all, you only put a limited amount of effort into playing this game in the first place. 

But, you've played for a few months now. You actually enjoy the game. In fact, you are actually getting pretty good at the game. Sure, people still call you a n00b, but you look right back at them and lol in their face while you carry their flag through a tumultuous throng of terrifying tyrants. Casual community play has become something of less intrigue, but you've heard of this mysterious thing called *Mumble*. But it takes commitment. It takes a few minutes worth of set up. You can't just click "Play Now" (no ceremony, jump in). It is a big step to take, no denying that. But if you are interested in learning the basic steps of how to enter into and enjoy the world that is Mumble, read this quick and easy guide to help sooth your doubts.

**I. Defining Mumble**
*****
**Mumble** is a voice over IP (VoIP) application similar to programs such as TeamSpeak and Ventrilo. For tagpro, it's best place to organize pick-up games (PUGs) and also just to talk to other players. The games you play that are set up here are often of significantly higher quality than normal public games. New players who regularly play PUGs often improve faster than those who don't.

/u/DrMcDonald has written up an excellent [Guide to Mumble for Newbies and Dummies](http://redd.it/1uqrhu) that i'd suggest you read for more on this. 

*****
**II. Download and Setup**
*****
* You need to first download the Mumble program from [http://mumble.sourceforge.net/](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/).

Go through some basic setup prompts. You don't have to change any of the preset options unless you really know what you're doing. It is a fairly vanilla program.

* When you see the [Mumble Window](http://i.imgur.com/ZlEWLyg.jpg), you have correctly completed your installation.

* Click Server  Connect  Add New. You'll end up with this [Add Server window](http://i.imgur.com/9GwrYVd.jpg) .

* Input one of the following depending on where you live and where you'll be connecting through.

Label|Address|Port
:---|:---|:---
TagPro Mumble|mumble.koalabeast.com|64738
European TagPro Mumble|mumble-eu.koalabeast.com|64738		
Oceanic TagPro Mumble|mumble-au.koalabeast.com|10054

* Input your own username. Click OK  Connect. Congratulations, you're in.

More setup information (regarding headsets and microphones) [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_mumble).

*****
**III. Navigating Mumble**
*****
The program [looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/TNq6izL.jpg) once you have gone through the process of logging in correctly. Admittedly, this can look cluttered and confusing thus leading to greater intimidation. Just slow your roll and listen...

There are many "rooms" - some you can go to and some you will need special access to enter. Don't worry about all the clutter, just find the **[PUG rooms](http://i.imgur.com/rLqruiN.jpg)**. In the U.S. Mumble, there are currently three different PUG rooms. Enter one and go through the following steps:

* Listen to see if a game is currently in session. If it is, wait patiently until it sounds like they are done. When they finish, either ask for a link using your mic or type it in the chat box to the left.

* They will provide you with a TagPro group link which, if there is room, will place you into their PUG group. *IF THERE IS NOT ROOM* you will be redirected to the general TagPro Groups page. Don't panic. They aren't trying to get rid of you by subterfuge. Just ask politely for the link again when there is room in the group.

* Once in, you might have to sit as a Spectator for a game or two if there are a lot of people in the group. This is normal, and can actually help you learn as you watch good players play.

* Soon, you will be able to switch off Spectator Mode and join a real live PUG game. 

*[Remember, this is just a basic walkthrough of how to navigate Mumble and play your first PUG. It is not comprehensive. For more information, please visit this [Mumble Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_mumble) and/or this [Guide to Mumble](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/comments/1uqrhu/a_guide_to_mumble_for_newbies_and_dummies/). If you have further suggestions/edits, please suggest them below.]* 




 If you give me until tomorrow, I will try to write up an explanatory guide to using Mumble for the first time. 




 I'll tell you why Mr. /u/DeweyIsOverrated. It is because Ubisoft intentionally leaks things so that we get super hyped like this. 

My belief is that we will not see concrete theatrical trailer evidence until E3. They want to hype Watch Dogs. But they don't want to leave us assassins behind. They will continue to drop breadcrumbs every couple of weeks to appease us.  




 And subscribed. Thank you for ruining my life. 




 I feel like I need more of this in my life for some reason. Please make this a thing. 




 I know that a dedicated Wiki would be useful for mods and users alike. It can answer a lot of the questions that were in the previous stickied message and a lot more. There are a number of repeated posts (i.e. Which game should I begin with? Will they conclude Connor's story? etc.) that have been answered a hundred times. A Wiki could help tremendously with this.

In regards to rank, I think having a ranking system is fun and intriguing. I do think that the way it is currently being done is difficult. I don't know enough about Reddit to offer alternative solutions, but developing a different system might be necessary. Maybe instead of the words, an icon can depict rank. That's my two cents. 




 In the past, Ubisoft has sped up their trailer releases and game information releases due to leaks. Do you think we will hear something official soon because of this leak? 




 Simple question: Which Chess piece is your favorite and why?

This is a shirt, a pant, and two shoes kinda look. 




 Colors must have been way off in the picture. My shirt is navy lines, lighter blue, white, and red. Cardigan is navy. Pants are kinda vintage grey. Shoes are light blue. Sorry about that guys and thanks for the feedback. 




 Freakin' A. We've got a person here, guys. Never thought i'd meet one! 




 I'm from Temple. An hour north.

 That was a crazy map. Good to see you Rookie!

 I've been playing regular community games for a couple of months now and was regularly frustrated by trolls/bad players/quitters/etc. 

I manned up an hopped on Mumble tonight, was playing in a game within five minutes, and everyone was nice and very helpful.

I just wanted to encourage other capable players to try out Mumble and see if PUG games are for you. They are for me.  




 I think those fit you very well. I wouldn't go longer. In fact, I wear mine slightly shorter than that. Really, wear them where it makes you feel comfortable and still looks good. Which seems to be exactly what you're doing. 




 I need a couple pairs of socks for the following:

**Chinos** (sand, camel, grey, navy)

**Jeans** (black, indigo)

**Suits** (black, navy) 




 I'm not sure that the original image of "Great Fall" was confirmed a fake. I know that some of the "leaked" videos were. 

I personally think it was completely fake, along with Desert Son, but I wouldn't doubt that there will be two releases this year. 




 **http://whatculture.com/gaming/assassins-creed-v-5-things-know-far.php**

**Summary:**

1. *Setting* - Assuming the Industrial Revolution because of Ubisoft Tumblr leak or Russian frontier because of AC Initiates Twitter posts.
1. *Gameplay* - We will probably see a return of the Brotherhood. No oceanic exploration. More stealth features, assassination missions, historical characters, and access to houses and buildings.
1. *Release Date* - Around Halloween/early November. Ubisoft already has a set information/title release date. Very close.
1. *The Protagonist* - Assuming assassin picture leak from Ubisoft offices in Montreal are real, we will most likely see an Industrial Revolution setting due to dark clothes for dirty times.
1. *Multiple Games* - Referencing Great Fall image leak to suggest that there will be a main title (ACV) and another smaller game released in 2014 (possible Great Fall extending from comics).

Thought it was an interesting read, but didn't seem to add anything new. Your thoughts?

**EDIT:** I'm still not sure if AC Redditors know how/when/why to upvote/downvote. I am sharing a link and reporting statements. I am not trying to say they have found anything new. I agree, the article is fairly poor, but no reason to punish me for it. Don't have to upvote. But no reason to downvote a report.
