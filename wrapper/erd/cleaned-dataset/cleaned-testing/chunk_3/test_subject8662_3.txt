 Lol Thanks. Like a lot of people who got bullied I had develop a sense of humor as a defense mechanism, both for them and me. They punch softer when they're laughing.  




 Thanks. One of my friends cut the trailer together, think he did a pretty awesome job.  




 Repost from earlier reply: That's what I was initially diagnosed with a year ago. At the time it was atypical because I could sleep and find some joy in day to day life. Less so now.

 




 Acting is what I'm weaker at, I'll probably be doing more writing/directing. Thanks for the good thoughts!

 And you as well

*looks at user name*

I think... 




 Nope, I'm down south.  




 It pretty much goes Friends/family, Dog, complete strangers, unit, corps, God, Country, then me.  




 Lol. It only goes so far, but it's fun when it works.  




 Appreciated, working on moving towards bigger and happier things.  




 That's great! I hope to get there one day. The good days are getting very slowly more frequent on the pills, hopefully one day I'll be able to get it without the pills.  




 Thanks for asking! 




 Oh not at all.

I'm finishing up a degree in Theatre, but I'm going to be pursuing a film career. As for work work, I work in the customer service field in a call center.  




 Ok, I think I see what you're saying. I'll definitely look into that. Thanks.  




 *Honest reply redacted due to being typed at work* 




 What I thought was the proper definition was wrong. I looked it up and realized my mistake. I will be clarifying it with my doctor the next time I see him so I can speak with the proper level of information on the subject.  




 A couple people have said they don't think they'd pull through, but I still say you'd be shocked. 

Honestly the stereotypical emo description really works best. It's like you're walking down a long dark tunnel with water up to about mid-shin. It's cold, clammy, uncomfortable at all times and all you want to do is just lay down and not feel that anymore. After a while, that becomes your reality and the cold clamminess almost supplants the concept of the warm blanket. It's almost comfortable.  




 Everyone thinks I'm quiet when in reality I just don't unleash the full crazy until you know me well enough not to call in the guys with the butterfly nets. 




 I read this after another d-bag had called me a faker and didn't read the don't. Then I was confused by the rest of your post. You're the politest troll I've ever met. 

Kidding aside, thanks a lot, I appreciate that.  




 I'm starting to look at meditation and lucid dreaming. Also reading into some Buddhist ideals. Is that kind of like what you're talking about? 




 I'm 22, fat, white, with bad knees and back from spending a good deal of time inside lockers, this was my only option.  




 Hopefully they will/are. Medication is starting to help.  




 I saw there was a post about what redditors have depression on the front page and I thought I'd get discussion going. There's a difference between starting a discussion on a website where no one knows who I am IRL and seeking attention. I'm not walking around with a Double Depression sandwich board.  




 Yes I'm currently on Prozac and we'll see about adding that/switching it up as time goes on.  




 My only regret is... that i had... boneitis.  




 Running after pay day when I can afford them. Running the full spectrum.  




 Will do. 




 When I'm in a room with more than eight people my hands start shaking, it's not a matter of just punching through a case of the sadsys, there's something chemical in my brain that makes me sad/lonely/anti social that I can't correct with thought power.  




 Is that where not only do I go free, but the state give me 50k to send someone I dont like to a mental ward? 




 That was a many layered comment. Have an upvote.  




 Thanks! Doing my best. This is helping honestly.  




 The difference being those people slogged through X number of years in misery while I have a chance to live out the next 50 happy.  




 That's fine, I'm up for anything at this point. I'm not crazy about the idea of whether or not I remember to take a pill being the difference between happy day and struggling to get off the couch.  




 I know at the clinic they have a neuro psych department, but I don't know much about it so was just following the familiar roads.  




 Not gonna lie, it's a fun way to get out of shit/ask for favors. 

"It's your turn to do the dishes" "But I have double depression!" 




 Yes, when he used those words I started laughing hysterically. I think he might have been inching towards the phone to call in the guys with the jacket.  




 Thank you! 




 You'd be surprised what you can handle but thank you, I truly appreciate that.  




 Lol. It would be much appreciated. Have a pretty small acting role, but put in a shit ton of work behind the scenes, and I'm really proud of how it turned out.  




 Yeah, that was really unnerving and I'm hoping it doesn't re manifest.  




 Ok 




 Just hold on to the positives that you can and know that you are a beautiful person and people do love you. When you're ready, you really do need to seek some help, we can only do so much. But until you are ready, we are more than happy to do all we can.  




 Reference to the it gets better campaign last year. I'm straight but I took it for the purposes of that point.
