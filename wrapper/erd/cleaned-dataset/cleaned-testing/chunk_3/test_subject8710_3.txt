 i would atleast like some feedback if that isnt to much to ask 









 Master yi : "i sold my jungle item so i could deal more damage who needs that when im going to gank anyway" 




 i think aoki and kimura are going to improve with ippo this time around. Ippo lost and after his last loss he made the dempsy roll, but im thinking this time around ippo will be improving himself by helping aokimura out. possibly creating the new dempsy in the process and making aoki learn a move that isnt the frog punch. kimura just kind of sits back in his matches which isnt bad but he doesnt seem to do anything until the last rounds. were also still waiting on mike bison to find out how that goes if that match goes like the last matches we will see a mixture of hawk and eagle (which is basically just takamura) which would be takamuras biggest weakness. aokimura will see takamuras struggle possibly and realize that their idol could see a loss and want to improve with him.
