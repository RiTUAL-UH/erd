Jiffy! 00:33-00:37 




 Thanks!
 




 Thanks! 




 Thanks for the suggestion, I hadn't thought about doing that! 




 Ive kinda been doing baby steps into keto, like much less carbs and lots more veggies and protein, but I still give myself some allowances sometimes instead of just changing cold turkey. 

I also just finished my first year of college, and it having been summer vacation and being home really has changed a lot of things. I eat a lot less at meal times and I tend to snack less. 

I try to get out and powerwalk for about a half hour a couple times a week, but I really do owe most of my weight loss to my diet. 

The loss has been since probably the beginning of June, so maybe a month, maybe more? 

And thank you, I really do appreciate your kind words. The problem with these pictures, though, is that they are at a slight upward angle. It is really different with better lighting, and when I look at myself in one of those all angle mirrors, I do look a little different. For example, this is a picture taken of me on the fourth of July [(I'm on the left).](http://i.imgur.com/vst2Irt.jpg) My legs look great, and I have a bit of a food baby, so just disregard that roundness, but I do have some fat left in my arms and face that I want to get rid of. And I know its possible for me to be 125 again because that's what I was a year ago at the same height! haha 









 How did you do it? because my starting weight is 138 as well and i want to get down to 125, and we are also the same height. 




 Youre my inspiration, holy crap.
 




 Hey, I know that it's kind of late to be commenting, but as a 62 kg f/18/5'4" trying to lose about 4.5-6 kg, I have to know. Did your boobs get smaller? I really like where mine are at right now (so does my boyfriend) and I can only imagine that I would be kind of sad about it. Did yours get smaller, and how did you feel about it? 




 what was the music in this?
 




 It would go nice with card that says "Eat Shit." 




 I usually wouldn't say anything about this, but this post made me cringe. The amount of misogyny, accidental or not, on Reddit really shouldn't surprise me, but it never fails to. "You're plus sized, but you've found a way to make yourself look more appealing for my benefit, even though your physical appearance has nothing to do with me? Good girl." Yikes, guys. 




 You clever bastard. 




 You can unsubscribe to /r/atheism so that you never have to see that again. 




 Congratulations! Wow, she really loves you. I don't know if I could tell my SO the same thing. I bet she is lovin' your new body as much as you do! 




 Dang, you are HOT. 




 My friend got his last name down his side, and is planning to get his mother's maiden name down his other side. It's like a tribute to both sides of his family, sort of. 




 Sneezing when it doesn't indicate that they are sick or when it doesnt have any foreshadowing purposes. Just sneezing.
 




 what was the comment?
 




 Thank you, this is really cute! Sorry I took so long to reply, I haven't been on reddit lately. 




 /r/mildlyinfuriating is your home, brother
 




 Oh, duh. I'm sorry. I got all mixed up with usernames. Yeah, shoulder-length hair might be hard to do with a wand. 




 Your hair is definitely long enough; I have a friend whose hair is your length and I have curled it many times before. Sometimes it's hard to get the hang of it because the hair tends to slide off when you curl it, especially if your hair is freshly washed or really shiny and smooth. I'd start at the thick end of the barrel and wrap down, because the hair does slip a bit. Also, make sure you are doing it tight enough.  




 I love this. I wish I could give you more upvotes. 




 I read this and wanted to downvote something, but I wasn't sure what. Then I realized I just wanted to give Reddit one big downvote. 




 Random side note...you look like OAG. 




 I absolutely adore your natural color, so I don't think you should dye it, but If you're looking for a change, I'd say dark chocolate brown hair would look great on you, especially if you got a pixie cut. You could definitely pull that haircut off.

I'm not sure if you meant colorful as in blue or pink hair or something like that, so if you did, i think a blue-fade-to-purple ombre with a pixie cut would look great. It would go great with your eyeshadow. :)
