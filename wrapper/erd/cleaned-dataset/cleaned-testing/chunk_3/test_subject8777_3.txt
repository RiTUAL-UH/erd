 Hahaha we meet again my good friend! 




 To that i would say we are not trying to go for that wow factor all the time as we would like to see our music be used for things such as movies, commercials, sports films..etc so we like to leave space in the music and without a singer we understand that there isnt always something there that will grab and hold the occasional post rock listener, but that is ok for us. The songs have their moments that grab you and thats all we want, the rest is up to you :) 




 Hahaha thanks, someone at the bar the other night made the same comment and I had to google it to see bc I couldnt remember..good call tho  




 We are putting it out there ourselves with the intent of it being used for film and/or commercial work so we would like to make the money that way and not by way of sales, so with that said we will not be selling it but making it available online for free download to anyone who asks..but with any luck the album should be done by then end of this year or the very beginning of next..it comes down to how quick i can mix it all hahaha..keep an ear out tho and facebook is how we keep everyone updated so check that periodically too :) thanks again tho and good ear on the semi circle comment! 




 Thanks soooo much brotha!! I appreciate that!! 




 They are live recordings ;) and nice call on the semi-circle...did u see the video? 




 Thanks soo much man! I really appreciate you taking a listen to the music and i am happy you enjoi it! Pass it along and if youd like the link to the online free download let me know and keep an ear out for the full length cd that should be coming out sometime before the new year :) facebook of course too blah blah blah
