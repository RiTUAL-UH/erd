It's nice to allow the music to take you back to the movie and imagine the scenes. Simon and Garfunkel are brilliant. 




 If you lock your keys in the car and the spare keys are at home, call someone at home on their cell phone from your cell phone. Hold your cell phone about a foot from your car door and have the person at your home press the unlock button, holding it near the mobile phone on their end. Your car will unlock!  
  
Edit: your car must have remote keyless entry, of course

 So...you are technically dead?  














 Once upon a time there was a wise man who used to go to the ocean to do his writing. He had a habit of walking on the beach before he began his work. One day he was walking along the shore. As he looked down the beach, he saw a human figure moving like a dancer. He smiled to himself to think of someone who would dance to the day. So he began to walk faster to catch up.

As he got closer, he saw that it was a young man and the young man wasn't dancing, but instead he was reaching down to the shore, picking up something and very gently throwing it into the ocean.

As he got closer he called out, "Good morning! What are you doing?"

The young man paused, looked up and replied, "Throwing starfish in the ocean."

"I guess I should have asked, why are you throwing starfish in the ocean?"

"The sun is up and the tide is going out. And if I don't throw them in they'll die."

"But, young man, don't you realize that there are miles and miles of beach and starfish all along it. You can't possibly make a difference!"

The young man listened politely. Then bent down, picked up another starfish and threw it into the sea, past the breaking waves and said- "It made a difference for that one." 




 *Holy dog shit! Texas? Only steers and queers come from Texas and you don't look much like a steer to me, so that kinda narrows it down.* 




 Cocaine is a hell of a drug! 




 Does he nominate another person/-s or is the chain broken here? 




 Damn it. This reminds me of season two of "The Wire".

 Sometimes that shark....he looks right into ya. Right into your eyes. And, you know, the thing about a shark hes got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a dolls eyes. When he comes at ya, doesnt seem to be living until he bites ya, and those black eyes roll over white and then ah then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin. The ocean turns red, and despite all the poundin and the hollerin, they all come in and they rip you to pieces. 

So, eleven hundred men went in the water; 316 men come out and the sharks took the rest. 




 Yep, that's the one
