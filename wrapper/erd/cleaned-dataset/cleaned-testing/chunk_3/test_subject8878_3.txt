 I'm quite jealous of you. My older pig just tolerates me with no enthusiasm and my younger pig is learning from her! 




 I'm 18 and I usually pop by r/scotland but have recently added r/edinburgh to that. 




 I'll try it sometime. I went to cafe Andaluz recently which had lovely food and that was tapas so I should enjoy empires cafe too. 




 oh awesome! where are they all?
