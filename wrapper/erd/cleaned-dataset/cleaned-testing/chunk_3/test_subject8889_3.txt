 I've never physically gone somewhere for a random investigation, but I would advise you to do your homework.

a shield is the most basic and most important thing you need to know, so I'm glad you do.  That's the first thing anyone should teach anyone (learned that the hard way).

maybe bring a thermometer or something which has heat vision (maybe there's an app for that?)  You want to be able to detect and document sudden dips and spikes in temperature.

Bring matches.

But, by do your homework, I mean read into where you are going.  What sort of events have been reported from there.  Get a good idea of what you should be prepared for.  Do not go in over your head.  If a place is famous for people disappearing, and there is nothing out there on how or why or anything, don't be stupid and go out there alone to solve the mystery.

I wish I could offer more, but that's all I've got atm.  

Work on getting stronger.  Work on expanding your shield, hardening it, feeding more energy to it, etc.  try to heat water; try to diffuse a headache.  Simple things to focus your energy for a purpose.

 I think we can take a page from Europe on this one, just the general concept though: Have campaigns be state funded.  

We don't have to give them much.  It can be just a base amount which allows you to run a couple of ads and such.  Everyone, even corporations, would still be allowed to donate, but the donations would be to political parties rather than to individual candidates.  This would alleviate clientellism.  The political parties would then distribute these funds to their candidates according to need/the scope of the campaign.

For example, if you donate $1,000 to the North Carolina Democratic Party, they might distribute $175 to the Gubernatorial candidate, $175 to the Senate candidate, $80 each to 5 House candidates, and  $2.50 to each of the 100 counties' local Democratic Parties.  (This distribution is completely hypothetical; I am not saying that should be the ratio).  You could also donate to the local party organization in your county, if you want the money to specifically go there. 




 it is affectionately referred to as pork, and that's simply corruption and bribery.  It's all about the money to many, even when it shouldn't be; even when our health and our future is at stake.  We have to have a livable planet and a functional society for money to even matter.  Priorities get twisted with power and greed.  People who have never seen poverty, who have never walked in anything other than designer shoes, can't relate or fully comprehend the effects of their actions, which adversely affect so many.

Spin is another big issue.  Some people (*losely defined*) are so good at putting a spin on things such that people think something will help them when it will only hurt them, and vice versa.  Like the estate tax. 




 I plan to run for office in an effort to effect as much positive change I can in policy areas including, but not limited to: healthcare, housing, criminal justice, and environmental policy.

For someone who seeks to write and pass legislation, given your in-depth analyses, do you think I would have better chances in the House or the Senate?  Are there any tips from your observations as to what makes a bill more likely to pass if the other party (*Republicans*) don't want to see it happen?

Thank you 




 oh, sorry; forgot to mention, as far as what it means, if there was something there, could be a ghost, could be being watched by a guardian angel, anything really.  it depends on the specifics, which, if you are in a public place, you may never know, as it could be something tied to you, or the place.   




 I feel that way sometimes just out of nervousness/paranoia like others said; like if I've watched or read something, or it's dark, or if I happen to think of something which psychs me out into that state. 

Also, if you've had a small amount to drink, it is way easy to freak yourself out in this way.  like full on sweaty palms for no reason other than the thought crossed your mind "what if there's something behind me?"

I'm talking about feeling like there's something behind you, or just out of your line of sight.

Feeling like you're being watched is technically a little different.  

And there is a definite difference from these feelings caused by nervousness and when they have a legitimate cause.  

The former is just a nagging/irking suspicion.  The latter is when you can feel the stare boring into you; like they're burning holes in you from looking/glaring so hard.  

are you familiar with Kundalini and Chakras (I apologize for spelling if that's wrong)?  they are energy centers in your back.  The strongest one is in your lower back.  Aka the small of your back.

That's where you feel it when someone is behind you.

If there is really something present, you will feel it there.  no question.

Side note: If you take note of those feelings, then you will start to notice when people are behind you, you feel different people in different ways.  This could be because of their aura at the time (mood they are in; vibe they are giving off), their personality, their intentions, or their relationship to you.

When you trust someone with your life, and are fully familiar with them and in tune almost to the point that you are one person, you may not feel them coming at all. 
Some people you may feel coming before they even get close to you.  you may even lean back from the feeling, which is your body trying to balance the pull of energy in your lower back.  (Happened to me right now just thinking about it; because, when I remember things, I remember and re-experience the emotions I experienced at the time). 

Anyway, I hope this helps! 




 So it was hoarding the bottles.  But I wonder what the gate was originally built for, in front of a small area before a dead end...

I guess it's a good thing you (and presumably OBE girl) are not Hispanic.  It probably turned up that time and not the others thanks to the presence of your Portuguese friend of friend. 

The strangest part of this story to me is that you're a European in like, your 30's give or take, and the most you've ever drank is 2 shots of whiskey and a beer :p (or some beer, not clear but irrelevant). 

One could argue that maybe El Tio, if that's what it was, was summoned by the miners' belief in him, or alternatively, the more likely scenario, which concerns me, is that, since he is supposedly, according to your notes, a guardian, then he showed up to protect his people from something worse that was lurking, which would explain the deaths (if he is a guardian, as you said).  

The idea of accepting offerings of cigarettes and alcohol points to the pile as being his hoard, but I don't know whether to think what you saw is El Tio or not.  Since it disappeared when you said its' services (protection) are no longer needed, then maybe.  But, perhaps its services were still needed?  depends on what it was protecting people from.  Although, if so many people died, maybe it wasn't doing a good job. 

Or maybe the miners weren't leaving behind as much booze as the teenagers :)  , so it didn't stick around as much.  Who knows? 




 no; it's not pointless at all.  I don't agree with some of the things you said about existence and identity, but I do agree with what you said about ideas; so, I guess I need to clarify as well.

There aren't really any "original" ideas.  Everything has already been thought of.  You can see that in the progression of technology in the "modern"/"developed" world, where our modern conveniences such as plumbing/running water already existed in ancient Rome, for instance.  

We tune into / pick up the idea, and, as is psychologically necessary, it passes though our frame of reference, and we perceive/interpret it as our own, original, idea.  




 you might have a sleep disorder; but I don't see how sleepwalking and such would enable you to rip the sheets; then again, people can beat people up in such a state.  I have torn Pj's at the seams from moving too much, but that's a whole other animal.  

It sounds like you're thinking werewolf or something.  Real life "werewolves" is simply a genetic trait of having too much hair.  I'm thinking you have no comments yet because no one is taking you seriously.  I don't really either, but I am giving you the benefit of the doubt, or rather, belief.

You may also have unwanted visitors.  Mice, Raccoon, squirrel, ghost?

Any signs of any of those unwanted visitors?   




 actually to address the lucid dreaming more, I have a slightly different take on that than the literature you'll find online.  I've doing it since before I knew about it, and I have a different approach.

Here's what I recommend doing, /u/ShyhiemDragon , :
 - first, you need to develop an awareness of when you are dreaming.  I don't have a particular method I use for this, I just generally can tell from context clues/ rationality.  But, to do this deliberately, it would help to come up with a system.  Like a totem (if you've seen Inception).  Think of an action, maybe, that you can't do irl but can in a dream (flying is an example, but may be too dramatic to work at first; letting go of mental barriers and making yourself fly can be hard if you have no experience controlling your dreams, as you have to be really sure of yourself to just leap up and fly.  I've done it but lost my self assurance and plummeted several feet before picking back up; not a good feeling).  So something like that, but milder.  Maybe try to jump over something big or tall. (I can't jump more than a couple inches irl.)  Or, more like the totem, go to sleep with something in your pocket or something. 

Taking a step back; you say you have a nightmare problem.  I had so many nightmares as a kid, but I could, most of the time, tell it was a dream.  I learned how to wake myself up.  
- close your eyes
- focus on the fact that it's a dream
- relax as if to meditate; control your breathing
- count backwards from whatever number feels natural to you (I used 10; usually would wake up by the time I got to 3 or 4). 

I had a horrible literal end of the world nightmare once when I was like 12 or so, and I woke myself up, went back to sleep, and it continued, so after I came aware (didn't take long as it was a continuation), I ran to safety and woke myself up again.  It continued one more time I think.  That was the worst nightmare I ever had, until the sleep paralysis one I just mentioned in another comment above.  They're tied for worst I guess, in different ways.

So, back to the lucid dreaming,
- once you have mastered, to a reasonable extent, knowing when you are dreaming, then it is just a matter of taking the wheel.  Being yourself; taking control of yourself, if you get what I mean.  Once you are aware its a dream, just be you, in your body there
- start maybe by asking questions.  My favorite I did once was I was in my elementary/primary school, and I saw a janitor; I asked him what year it was, and he said "can't you read the calendar?"  lol
- Investigate; walk around; explore; be bold.  
- try to fly if you want, but the time I did that, besides dropping myself as I mentioned before, I also felt like it took the magic out of the dream. I like to explore the naturally developed environment of the dream; if you change everything up, then it's just a sandbox and that takes the magic out of it for me.

hope this is helpful 




 yes, just be careful not to fall into sleep paralysis.  I've never experienced it, but I dreamed that I had one time; a quite vivid dream.  It was easily the most terrifying dream I've ever had. 




 "T-minues 5 to tea time! We're casting off into Boston Harbor; I hope George likes it salty!" 




 yeah, like I said, only helps a tiny bit.  

Must be combined with good music and tea or hot cocoa, as well as a phone call or chat in order to be of measurable help 




 High school senior by any chance?  or in community college? here's a list of unconventional and controversial persuasive speech topics:

- we should have 13 months with 28 days each, instead of the 12 months we have. 

- High school graduates who are under 18 should be allowed to vote.

- High school graduates who are under 18 should receive full legal rights upon graduation (age of majority law).  (I did this one for my senior thesis/ speech)

- one should have to pass a test of common sense in order to gain the right to vote

- we should require one to pass a psychiatric evaluation in order to purchase firearms.

- we should, like some European nations, have a quota for women in the government

- Daylight savings time is unnecessary.

- Rather than charging students more for things on campus (paying for the convenience), they should instead be subsidized, to help students with cost of living.  (This is how it's done in the UK where I am currently studying abroad, so yeah...) 

- Universal Healthcare

(If you are not American, I am sorry, as many of these will not be applicable.)

**DISCLAIMER: these are controversial topic ideas and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of the poster.  Thank you. ** 




 there is a word for that actually.  it is commonly referred to as "the oversoul". 

I am not a believer in the oversoul, but I do believe in a sort of, what you might call, universal consciousness, just not in that form.

See, /u/TheAlienDude , when we think, speak, or act, we use energy.  These words and ideas are usually in the form of waves.  Sound waves, radio waves, waves of energy from our thoughts, physical shockwaves from our actions, etc.  

These waves do not cease to exist when we cease to see or hear them.  They travel throughout the universe.  This is how we pick up on things we could not "possibly" know, and how we come up with seemingly random ideas.  When you get a random idea, google it.  Chances are, someone has already thought of it recently somewhere halfway around the world, and that's just how long the waves took to reach you.

Some people are more receptive to it than others.  Like having stronger antennae.

If I had to guess, I'd say you picked up on their thoughts or conversations about the food they had bought, and interpreted it as your own craving.  However, it is also possible that they picked up on your thoughts about what you wanted to eat, and interpreted it as their own idea of what to buy. 




 yeah, the "crew" that I sometimes worked with was already in it, we just kind of joined up for some cases, although there was too much drama as I kind of had a secret thing with one of them (also via OBE, (chilling on a cloud over New York City is a great way to spend an afternoon) although we acknowledged it privately in person a couple of times/ways, to assure each other we didn't make it up in our heads).

and like I said, I learned my lesson the hard way about endangering people, with my friend who turned out to be a frenemy, which is why I backed off when I got with my ex, although I've come to regret that decision sometimes.  That rather than backing away, I should have taught him how to defend himself even more than I did, and if I had kept teaching him, we could have eventually fought together, as a power couple.  But that's a moot point now. 




 this is a story from high school, about the pressure to succeed and the value of life.  (I've told it once before in a public speaking course in undergrad.)

I was dual-enrolled in the community college, and I had AP courses.  I was in a multitude of extra-curriculars.  I handled it well, and I enjoyed it.  

I also had a pet fish.  A koi fish named Reggie.

I took care of him all my own; I didn't leave any of the responsibility to my parents.  He was my child; he lived in my room.  

Koi are quite intelligent.  He definitely felt a strong attachment to me.  I knew this because, one time, my dad came in the room, and Reggie literally flipped out; thrashing/ spazzing in the bowl, until I said "It's ok, relax; this is my dad."  Then, much to my dad's surprise, and somewhat to mine, Reggie immediately calmed down.  He also spazzed out when I had another visitor, but that's a private tale; although, I should have known to cover the tank.

Reggie was also a nicer fish than I've ever had or known: he let me pet him when I cleaned his bowl.

Later in the school year, my life got insanely busy.  I was doing homework each night from after dinner until about 1 am. He was due for a cleaning, but it was far too late, so I told him I would get to it the next day.  This proceeded for a few days (not really sure how many), until one evening, I came back to my room from dinner to find Reggie floating, very wrong.  His bowl was filthy.  And it was all my fault.  I was in shock/disbelief at first.  I had to poke him a couple of times before I accepted that he was gone.  I took him in a papertowel to the kitchen to announce the news, and I cried over him.  I told him how sorry I was that I let this happen.  I felt like the worst mother in the world, and that I could never be trusted with a life.  

I'm crying a little now just remembering that night.

**So, I learned a valuable lesson.  When you are responsible for someone's life, that comes first, before anything.**

It wouldn't have taken too long to clean him.  I could have done it one of those nights before settling down to homework/projects.  
I was just too naive.  

(I also didn't learn until later that Koi really need a tank, but he was doing fine in his bowl as I had kept it super clean up until then.)

I have looked in the pet stores, but have yet to see another koi with blue eyes like Reggie.  

One day, when I have my own permanent place, I will get a koi pond, and a couple of blue-eyed koi fish.
 




 you are not useless.  although its too late for your ferberizing parents to realize the importance of physical affection in raising a mentally and emotionally stable person, it's not too late for you.  Don't be afraid to show affection.  

I have been hugged plenty, but lately I get this "really need a hug" feeling too sometimes, and I hug my pillow, which helps a tiny bit. 




 she made you emotionally damaged and unavailable and that is really fucking sad.  I'm so sorry that happened to you, man.

I broke up with my ex a few months ago (also HSSH); he was all of my firsts, and I was many of his.  But, there were a lot of legitimate issues behind that, and we are still good friends; we are a support system for eachother I guess you could say.  

I would never abandon someone like that.

I can only imagine your pain, but just know that there are better, more mature and loving people out there.  Don't put up a wall; that wall will only keep you from finding happiness.  

Good luck!  be strong 




 I have many stories about predictive dreams, but everyone has those and they are abundant.

I have, however, a weird story involving poetry that I wrote.  I have written a lot of serious poetry, but at that particular point in my life, I was in a humor poetry phase, particularly humor at others' expense.  (I know, I was immature in school; so was everyone else). 

Our English teacher had been on leave long-term because she had had a baby.  We had a long-term sub who was actually a retired teacher, from the "old school" if you will.  She made us diagram sentences and other tedious, outdated, unnecessary, nit-picky grammatical things.   She also assigned far more homework than we were accustomed to.  We all abhorred that class under her (a word I learned independently that year).  After a few weeks of this, even our parents had complained to the school about the amount of work Mrs.Substy* would assign.  We had no idea when our normal teacher would be coming back.

One day, in homeroom, in the morning, I wrote a poem about her going away.  It was wishful thinking at its' finest.  It started with: 
"today's the day, today's the day, the day Mrs. Substy* goes away!..." and ended with a simple "...good riddance!".
(I still have the hard, hand-written copy of the poem back at home).  I showed it to my friends and we had a good laugh.

That afternoon, when we went to English class, SURPRISE!  Our regular teacher was back!  Mrs. Substy* really was gone!  At the time, I wondered if this meant I could make things happen by writing poetry, but I realize now, of course, that it meant I subconsciously picked up on the vibe somehow and predicted it. 

TL;DR: I wrote a poem about a strict long-term substitute teacher going away that day, and then she actually did. 




 and it's funny that you reference knowledge and truth.  at one point, I referred to myself as "the bearer of truth" . 

I am currently in graduate school, and always an independent student of many more disciplines; life is a long pursuit of knowledge.  

Most people don't pay attention to the truth, only what they are told.  I focus my online posting, in all mediums, to do everything I can to raise the public awareness of the lies and injustice in our world.

My whole life's mission (including my career goals), the reason I believe I am here on this earth, is to fight for truth and justice.   




 I see this account has also only been around for a few days like our friends here, so I take it you made it for these discussions?  Thus, does "iwasthesword" mean that you have a personal experience you aren't sharing?  Calling yourself a sword....so you feel used?

I don't know what your experience is, but I have never felt used by fighting for life and light, only empowered.  

If you felt used, I'm afraid you may have been dealing with something different entirely.  Unnatural is not quite the right word.  Untoward may be better.  

Perhaps you were conned into working for the dark side? 




 May I please have "Eclectic Catholic Warrior" as my flair? 




 when you would heal, did you just focus the energy on making them better?  or did you focus on the healing process of the specific ailment internally (for example, visualizing white blood cells in action, working in hyper speed).  I do the latter.  




 *thanks*

I firmly believe that if something needs to be done, for the good of the world, in one way or another, the powers that be will make that energy available to you.  It is lent, yes, but in that, you are a warrior in what I take you would call *their battle* , but it's our battle.  

We are not puppets; we are active participants.  Puppets simply do as they are told.  By definition, we are far from that.  

I am aware of hard effort it takes to become powerful; I am nowhere near where I would like to be.  But in a pinch, the energy from your adrenaline and urgency heightens your power dramatically, as do any other forces who want to see you succeed at the particular mission.  
And I don't have to wonder; I know, my friend.  Faith is a powerful thing.  I am not a puppet.  I am a warrior.  (well, I was, and I would like to be again).  




 I've heard this story before, and I thought I remembered reading that they made an agreement to trade places (a la mode de Parent Trap), but I could just be misremembering that because it's what I would have wanted to hear. 




 yes, this is one of my favorites 




 wow; ok.  I don't even know where to start.
I guess I'll just go down through the order you went in, and elaborate on things as I go.

Although I was already sort of interested, I was 12 when I formally began studying this stuff independently, so around the same age.  
I can't speak to your experience with the mirror specifically, as I know nothing about that other than my dad told me that if you stare into the mirror long enough you will see who you were in a past life.
I too have some really vague early memories, like the taking of my first portraits (as a baby).  One's vision is not fully developed at that point; all I know from the memory is that it was done by what I can determine was an old lady (although I certainly didn't know the meaning or vocabulary to interpret that at the time).
I'm so sorry to hear about your childhood trauma.

Becoming empowered, if you will, had the opposite effect on me.  It's like I became a new person.  I had suffered from some anxiety issues in childhood, and, at that point, I learned to overcome them, with mental fortitude, and it's like my childhood before that was sealed off like a past life.  I remember major things and the general format of regular occurrences, like going to the mall with my mom, but not a lot of specific mundane memories.  Those are somehow locked away.  

Dreams with premonitions are a perfectly normal part of life; some people just have them a lot more than others, if you are receptive to it, and if you sleep well enough to remember it.  Lately I haven't been sleeping well, but when I do, I remember my dreams every night, and have *psychic* ones at least once a week.  My most recent one predicted that I would have to go to the store with my mom to return a pack of socks.  But in the dream they were white socks; the real ones, the next day, were black socks.  So yes, of course, the signals you are subconsciously picking up on are never exact, because although, theoretically, the signal your mind is receiving and reading ought to be exact, it must pass though our mind and perceptual set (our lens of understanding), and be interpreted into language.  And I am totally familiar with the "THIS IS IT" moment.  I wouldn't describe it in quite the same way, but it feels great. 

I am quite good at getting a feel for people's intentions/emotions, and I can complete sentences and such for people.  I don't have a deep empathic link like you described though; that is intense.

I have no connection to Buddhism, but meditating to channel energy is basically the first thing I learned how to do in this field.  As you surely already know, but may or may not have realized, the first thing one must be able to do is clear one's mind; think of absolutely nothing. 

In my mind's eye, my energy is electric blue and sparkly.  My favorite color tbh.  I guess it resonates with me.  so greenish yellow (which is one of the colors that only a percentage of the population can see, thanks to having extra cones in the cornea) is evidently a color which resonate with you. 

It's really cool that you met someone like Dakota.  I wish I had.  I taught some people some skills; my dad is into this stuff but I never could really talk to him about these things in more than a theoretical sense.  the director for a theater play I was in once, after I had read someone's mind and freaked them out because they somehow knew (I didn't do it as a parlor trick, I did it to guess a number to get a part in the intro scene we were adding), so she, the director, calmly talked about aborigine mental communication until he calmed down (like two minutes).  

Enchanting objects is quite easy to do.  As with any "spell", if you will, it is all about channeling energy for intentions; simple as that.  One of the persons I was teaching was my ex, before we got together.  I'd taught him to do make a shield (like you described sealing the room sort of), and I could feel him extend it around me as he practiced it.  I didnt say anything, because, as we were just friends at the time, I didn't know how to react to such a personal trust; because that's almost like giving someone access to your soul; like, I'm protecting myself from any potential negative influences, but I feel no need to protect my mind and my soul from you.  I didnt say anything, but then he asked if I knew what he did, and I let him tell me before I said I knew, because, at the back of my mind, I didnt want to be wrong.  

I hadn't been teaching him long when he enchanted an object, a hairbow, and gave it to me.  I didn't have to ask though; I knew exactly what he did.  It was a love spell.  The "legal" kind; the reminder/make you think of me kind.  I knew and I wore it anyways because it was sweet. I told him "I know what you did to this", and he just smiled.

your friend's ability to visibly see the energy and not just sense it is very special.  I had one friend who could visibly see auras (I think, or she could feel the color; one or the other).  I have yet to visibly see such things, but I can feel them, and visualize them in my mind's eye.  so, on that note, could Dakota see the color of the energy?  or just sense it?

People are socialized to not believe though.  I had an ex friend who I had started teaching, whom me enemies turned against me (yes mind control spells are a thing; she was the first I taught, and from then on, I learned to teach defense first, as I was describing about my ex).  Even if they've witnessed things, like how Dakota accurately described what you did, they can be convinced it wasn't real.  So watch out for that.  Do you still speak to Dakota?

Earth is my element; there's a story about how I know that as 100% fact (but I dont like dirt?, so it's strange).  I am quite impatient.  I have done "work" that involved a meditative state for more than 20 minutes, but to just focus energy for 20 minutes solid?  That I've never done.  I would like to though.  who knows what I could accomplish.

That being said; to make anything big happen, it is a fact I have found, and that a powerful wiccan I know (who I didn't find out was a wiccan until later) also happened to say, is that: *you have to need it* .
One of the biggest things I've ever done, I did without waiting for a buildup of energy, because the energy came from the sheer force of dire need. (I can share that story too if you want).  The need however, lies with the person.  What is a dire need for you may not be a dire need for others.  If you can make yourself feel a dire need, then the power is yours.  That is hard to fake though.  I am still working on it (though not as much as I'd like to).

Energy manipulation has a young prime.  Once life responsibilities take over your mental energy, it is hard to do, unless you've kept it up continuously.  The biggest tip I can give you, especially to get the dreams back, is to get adequate sleep.

I have been staying up late lately, because I am studying abroad and have major FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) with my night owl friends.  But prior to that, I had been getting more sleep and thus, having more lucid and *psychic* dreams.

That last experience you mentioned though, specifically, I don't think that's earth energy.  That's electric, or weather.  Just pure energy really.  That's what lightning and thunder are.  Electricity.  Sheer force.  A force of nature. :)

So yeah; I could probably go on and on, but I hope this is helpful/ comforting, and feel free to AMA.  




 hmm.  that's kind of an iffy answer, but I think it confirms a ghost or presence of some sort if they're not going there as frequently but still going to that room, specifically to the window where one of the incidents occurred.
I've never had a dog though, so I can't attest to the normality of such behavior, and individuals are different, so only you can make that judgement if this behavior is normal for your dogs.  It could be attributed to the stress of moving, and they may simply be doing it less because they got used to it. 




 there's no need to be "terrified".  To be honest, you and live with a ghost like that with no problem.  But, if you want to try and help it, then what you suggested is a good way to star; but don't ask for a name.  Go to one of the places you encountered it, and sit, relax, as if you were meditating, then try to get a feel for the presence.  If you can sense it there, try to reach out to it, by thinking really loud/hard "I mean you no harm.  Maybe I can help you.  who are you?  what do you need?"  If you can get any kind of response out of it, maybe you can figure out how to persuade it to move on.  But don't be pushy about it; that may just upset it.

Not 100% sure that you have a ghost though.  It could be electrical, as dogs can sense that too.  So, to clarify, when you say the things stopped happening after you asked, did the dogs also stop barking at the unseen?  that is the determining factor here. 




 As you and /u/EmpathyistheEnemy may be able to infer from the conversation in /r/paranormal earlier today, I too have a similar experience.

I was recruited at the age of 12 by my "guardian angel", who had been an attached spirit to me for as long as I could remember.  
I had had experiences with malicious spirits in the past, most notably that one tried to kill me when I was about 5 years old; it was no accident.  Without having thought too much about it, I had managed to trap that spirit in a household item some time later.  My recruitment happened after I, 7 years later, accidentally released it because I had forgotten it was there.  

The recruitment happened at night in my bedroom; the spirit, in the form of a scarlet macaw with the posture of a vulture, was glaring at me from atop my bookcase, and issued me a challenge.  With bravery I didn't yet know I had, I accepted the challenge, and it went away, for the time being.  Then my guardian angel told me that I didn't have to do it if I didn't want to; I accepted the responsibility.  

So, I was recruited and my first mission was to defeat that spirit. 

I never did any fighting irl that I didn't organize with ppl I recruited.

All other fighting was, as I said in my other post, with *psychic force* if you will.

I worked both alone and with a group, which were people I knew from school, but we didn't really talk in school, only outside of school.

I wouldn't call the battles OBE, but rather mind travel or something, which is achieved kind of like a deep meditation.

As far as doing things while "hunting", you are more powerful in a group because you can pool your energy and stretch it, but other than that, no not really.  

Did you guys have rivals?  half of my fights were with rivals (also from school).  The other half were with entities.  I have faced off on ghosts, demons, something in between, and human rivals.

I gradually stepped back when I got with my ex, because my rivals, users of dark arts as they were, had befallen one of the people I recruited. I had started teaching my ex how to use his energy, starting with protection of course, and he had mastered things like shields.  But, I feared for his sanity, and compromising of my missions, should anything go after him while he was still not trained.  So, I stopped teaching him and stepped back from my duties, age of 15.

As such, my power greatly decreased.  But it is not gone.  I still have psychic dreams, and can feel auras when they're strong enough.  I can still do protection and healing spells. 

I have full faith that if I needed to step up to the plate for something, that God would lend me the power necessary to do so.  I believe that I will be able to tap into it if necessary.  I want to rejoin the fight though; I am still young. I would also like to teach, if not to fight, at least teach people to be, as I call it, "masters of their own minds".   

I've never recited anything in a language other than English.  Anything I need to know was simply made available to me.  I think of it as tapping into the knowledge that's out there; you could call it a universal consciousness, and ancient power source, or the energy of all the world's knowledge flowing in waves (sound, radio, etc), to which one can tune in.  As far as "spells" are concerned, it is simply a matter of intentions and directed energy.  There can be words, or not; you can use other's words, or your own.  That part doesn't matter.  There may be some high-level deep stuff that requires specific things, but I haven't come to that.

(did you use the term "hunting" because of Supernatural, btw?  one of the best shows ever.  I call them "battles" though.  Battles in the eternal fight of good vs. evil.)

As far as being confused about the intentions of the entities, as you mentioned in a reply above, where did you think your power was coming from?  Sure there's the base power you naturally have inside you, as a human being in God's image, functioning through electrical impulses, but the power used in battle is much stronger than that, particularly in spiritual battles.  So where did you think it came from?  (I apologize for my use of "God" if you're not Christian, but I, and I would think you also, given your experiences, believe that we all believe in the same God and just call him/her/it/the entity different things.)

Another question, besides the above asking if you had rivals, did you ever mange to do anything physical with your powers?  I know you said you had battles irl too (and the use of "irl" is not a good term; as Dumbledore famously put it "of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real"?  so I prefer to say mental and physical)
So, I know you had battles in the physical world/realm, but did you ever, in or out of battle, do anything physical with psychic energy?  like move things? My ex did when he was a kid, which is why I had started teaching him.  I, a year after recruitment, managed a great feat of this type, but it was electrical-physical, not actually moving anything, but a power-surge if you will.  (I can tell the story if you're interested)  But, so did you? 




 anyone else notice that the capital letters in the last set of usernames say "Kill Bye"
 




 I am not a skeptic, but it's clear to me that this is muckracking (gathering sparse examples into a weak case).  the chairs flipping can be wind, stray dogs, anything really.  The fridge opening by itself happens, as does with cabinets.  Pressure from the contents, the temperature, etc (especially if its an older fridge they don't close well).  Lights also act wierdly on their own, both incadesents and CFLs.  Noises like something fell but finding nothing happen in my house all the time.  I joke that there's a ghost, but I mean, it happens.  The tapping on your headboard is the creepiest, but I'm inclined to think nothing of it because the picture looks faked.  I mean, they say real blood looks fake to us because our mental concept of what blood looks like is based on fake tv blood.  So if its a real pic then, I'm sorry. 

Giving you the benefit of the doubt, if it is real, sit calmly on your bed, relax and settle in as if to meditate, reach your mind out around the house, try to get a feel for the presense.  If you can sense it, try to contact it.  Just sense for it and think really hard/ loudly "I mean you no harm; I want to help you; what do you need?"  Try to find out what the issue is.

hope this helps.

edit: typos 




 and you can lift your spirit though meditation to a higher plane and travel as the spirits do (OBE), but that's a conversation for another day 




 yes, exactly.  In my case, it was personal, so it was most appropriate to personally show her the door.  In op's case, if it does turn out to be something like a racist great grandparent or something, it may come down to her bf talking the spirit down.  It will depend on the details of the situation.  




 define exorcism; because if you mean old church stuff, that won't necessarily fly.  
If you loosely use "exorcism" to mean methods of getting rid of / vanquishing spirits, then yes that would be wise. 




 depending on how you look at it, everyone has "psychic powers", or you could say there is no such thing because it is normal, not a power.  We can all pick up on energy from eachother and things.  We all have the ability to sense each other's feelings or when something is amiss. Like antennae picking up on signals.  Some people just have stronger reception than others.  Knowing about it and being open to it helps you tune in more.

My experience with entities you can physically see is limited, but I have experience both with attached spirits and getting rid of negative spirits, but I accomplished that with brute (*psychic*) force.  

I don't know if op is strong enough for that.  If she hasn't deliberately channeled the energy, then likely she isn't.  

Ms.Medium sounds like she could help you /u/Brutally_honesttt .  Although I understand how she could sense the attached spirit and the aura, because that is just sensing and reading signals radiating from you, I dont know if she could help you fight off a nasty spirit.  

I would offer to help, as you don't have to be physically present to get rid of a spirit, for obvious reasons, but you do have to know what you're dealing with.  

In any case, you can try ignoring it as demonslayer suggested, but in case it doesnt stop/ gets worse, you need to try to find out what it is and what its deal is.  I don't think it'll try to hurt you with your *familiars* around, so keep them close.  Your bf may be vulnerable though, especially if he does have sleep problems; it would leave him in the vulnerability of sleep with the mobility of someone who is awake.  Worse case scenario with that: you wake up to him wearing that sadistic face choking you.  I don't mean to frighten you worse, but that is the worst case scenario as far as I can see.  Knowing that should help in the sense that you have less to fear if you know the worst you can expect.  Although, given that it probably let the dogs out, it can clearly do small movements of physical objects on its own.  If it wanted to hurt you though, at this point, it wouldn't do so by letting the dogs, who protect you, out.  It is just toying with you at this point. 

The last spirit I got rid of for someone toyed with me before I even found out about its existence; she visited me in a dream and glared at me.  I later found out her story, realized that was her, and knowing who she was and what her beef was, which was personal (dead ex of my then bf), I was able to take her out. 

If its some random spirit toying with you, it will get bored if you ignore it, yes.
If it is someone who has a beef with you living in that house for any reason (there could be *any* reason), then it will work harder to drive you out.  

So find out if there are any old stories related to the house, or any dead relatives who may have beef.

Hope this helps.  sorry I went on for so long... 




 The cat seems to be a good guy, in any case.  Although the bf most likely has a sleep issue, on the off chance that something worse is amiss, the last thing she'd want to do is remove the watchful alarm 




 I have false awakenings every now and then, but when I wake up for real, I have no trouble knowing the difference, that the first awakening was false.  In the dream, I only know its a false awakening about 50% of the time.  I dont have a particular test; I can usually just tell when something is a dream 




 I was thinking of that cat virus as soon as I read this headline.  This is yet another zombie-like infection IRL.
