 I spend more time napping than I do playing video games, everything hurts all the time, I consider going to bed at 11pm staying up late, when I do stay up late I spend my time worrying about adult things like heart disease and taxes, and those damned kids won't stay off my front lawn! 




 You know you're a pussy when you run from one. 




 That explains all the cuts in my mouth after that one time I did ecstasy.

 [Here's the wikipedia article on "Bicycle Infantry"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_infantry) where OP found this picture. I never knew bicycles were experimented with so much in war, so I found this to be an interesting read.

 Yes, but not because of this.

 I always thought that packaging in the food industry was limited to one product (or at most, two or three similar food products) per machine. That's how they show it on "How It's Made," so it never crossed my mind that something like this could happen. I guess the quality control guy was on break. 




 Computers.  
  
The only reason people think I'm good with computers is because I wear glasses. They always seem surprised when I can't update their hard drive, program their java scripts, or format their internet configuration for compatibility with the multi-servers.

 On closer inspection (now that I'm on a computer and not my phone) I can say I'm almost certain that is not a fallstreak hole. What you have there looks like a small gap in a layer of stratocumulus cloud, which is actually pretty common. It could be because of the way the cloud is forming or dissipating, or it could just be that the clouds are moving in such a way as to form a gap. Fallstreak holes usually only occur in mid to high level convective clouds, such as altocumulus and cirrocumulus. 




 Yep, that's a fallstreak hole.
