 Well that's that. It is his building. 




 Hey I know this isn't a budget post, but just some rough advice. If I were you, I'd consider one of two options:

1) Move in with parents if they have room and allow it and put ALL available money towards the loans. Even if you are only making minimum wage, at 40 hours a week (and if your job isn't full time, get a second one), you should be earning $1100 after taxes per month. Live like a pauper on $200, and pay $900 a month towards the loans. Do this as long as you can.

2) Pick up and move to the oil fields in the Midwest or Texas, or go work on a fishing boat in Alaska. Yes it will suck and it's dangerous, but you'll clear $100K a year and have the loans paid back in 2 years. 




 Curiosity compels me to ask what exactly do you do as an independent contractor and how you were able to grow your income so fast. 




 What state, if you don't mind? 




 While I agree with the advice, there's almost zero possibility this person will agree to meet at a police station and suggesting so may spook them so that OP will never get the car back.

Why not meet in the store parking lot with a guy friend? 




 Red's Saloon. I just moved here too and its my go to Packer bar. 




 Just moved to San Diego in July and that's the bar I go to! (Although I didn't make it out tonight, so I'm not in the picture.) 




 No problemo! Glad to spread the knowledge! I was an econ major and did plenty of statistics studies in undergrad, so I can see it from your view. 




 I was hoping someone would catch that. 




 I'm betting you paid with a credit card, no? You can always do a chargeback with the CC company.

If I were you, I'd politely request a refund, minus some money for the work they have done already, and if they refuse do a chargeback, then negotiate with them for the amount of work done already. 




 Well my opinion is that that fact is mind blowing. 




 Wrong. Quoting from the article: "The fixed ratio of AS/H in our population was 1.02 for males versus 1.01 for females."

AS/H means arm span to height ratio. The ratios are virtually identically.

Here's your peer reviewed source written by Phd's in the field: http://m.erj.ersjournals.com/content/37/1/157.full 




 But they are heavily correlated and the average person has a wingspan equal to their height. 




 That just sucks so much for him. From Romil's point of view he spent 21 years completely alone just to die a couple hours later. 




 Yea. Here's the thing, this movie was what, 100-200 years in the future? I'll grant them that they have an artificial uterus that can house the eggs until birth, but then what? Anne Hathaway and the robot have take care for hundreds of babies? I mean even if that robot is 100% about the babies all day long, doesn't the ship only contain a few years worth of food? So Hathaway has to farmer the crap out of the planet for her and 500 other mouths and simultaneously raise all these babies into at least 10 year olds until they can start contributing. I don't envy the task. 




 Saw a theory in these comments that said something like: it was an alternate timeline where humans survived the first time around, but decided to set it up where this timeline's humans survived most likely b/c it is a better existence than theirs. It stands to reason that if the future humans could control the 5th dimension, they could control the alternate timeline.

It's not perfect logic, but it works for me. 




 Neither. They said in the movie that "them" was humans far, far in the future, like hundreds of thousands of years, that had evolved into being able to control the 5th dimension. 




 Marcus' reach is 4" longer, but he's 3" shorter. Weird. 




 Is THIS what's going on?

I raise my hand to ask and answer questions at least twice a class, and some people just seem to hate me. I've played on IM sports teams with different groups at my law school and people seem friendly to me on the team and I get along with people in small groups, but I'm never invited to any group study sessions and nobody wants to work with me on the group research project. 




 The wording is a little weird, but they mean the unemployment rate in terms of full time, JD required jobs is above 20% for all but 20/200 schools. 




 I'm with you. What percentage of the population is open to torturing a child to death? 0.1%? I mean seriously, what are the odds they got together? Insanely low. 




 This. OP's parents should spend a couple hundred dollars to verify this with a lawyer who deals with international law issues on a personal level. 




 Next time just say "I had a very large soda for lunch, please excuse me for a minute" and go to the bathroom. 




 This prompted me to look at other terrible games.

I found Kim McQuilken, who went 5/26 with 43 yards, 0 TDs and 5 Ints. How the hell does he not get pulled earlier?! 




 That seems to be the consensus between other posters. Because if Romilly had gotten the robot properly working, he would have realized a all the supposed resources the planet had were nonexistent. 




 I too hated the paradox of future self giving info to past self causing him to become future self and it is the one thing I noticed in the film as someone with a modest to low knowledge of theoretical physics that just doesn't jive with any part of sound theory.

For the embryos part, I assumed they were scientifically advanced enough where they had artificial wombs to birth the children. Although it would still be a massive pain in the ass to care for all those babies. 




 Out of those movies , I have only seen Cloud Atlas so I can't speak to the others. In my opinion, Interstellar had the perfect recipe of tiptoeing just on the line of unbelievableness without crossing that line. I've yet to see a movie that placed itself above Interstellar in that respect. 




 It has a 71% rating mean that roughly 3/10 reviews say it is a bad movie overall. That fact is almost more mind blowing than the movie itself. 




 No way. I've seen all those and they don't compare at all. This too science fiction elements of several different kinds and blended them into a tale that stretches across about 90 years with significant portions at different points along the way. Further, it expands with physics to a point jusssst on the edge of unbelievable but theoretically sound enough for the average person. 




 That's just his Texas twang for ya 




 As a former Realtor, it is absolutely LAUGHABLE that any reputable company, let alone a bank, would use Zillow to calculate a home's value. Zillow is damn near worthless for accurate home values.
 




 You're right. It's tens of thousands of people who voted the exact way he described! 




 I misspoke. It can't be enforced below minimum wage. 




 They can't go below federal minimum wage. 




 And maters gonna mate 




 Or make election "day" 2 days long and everyone who works day 1 is not allowed to work day 2 and vice-versa. 




 I honestly believe he'd rather be playing. Do you not? 




 Ok. They willfully intoxicating themselves knowing it would vastly increase their risk of killing someone. 




 Completely agree with you. When someone beats their kid that bad and just doesn't see it as wrong, I feel like it is extremely hard to get them to turn their views around. I don't believe anything less than a couple years could make someone feel genuine remorse, especially not missing a few weeks of football.
 




 I mean it's only child abuse, right? 




 People that drive drunk don't intend to hurt anyone, but sometimes they kill people. Apply the same logic. 




 Here's a fun comic on entrapment. Kinda long, but you'll know entrapment pretty well if you make it to the end.

http://thecriminallawyer.tumblr.com/post/19810672629/12-i-was-entrapped 




 First file a claim with your insurance for the accident.

Second, do you have a lawyer helping with the lawsuit? If so, he can probably best answer your question. If not, just be honest in court and tell them everything. 




 If they haven't been paying their loan for 2 years, then this isn't "out of nowhere." In fact, that's about the longest a bank will go without payment before starting foreclosure proceedings.

In short, they've been duped by this "negotiator." While he may help some people, a bank WANTS people to pay the loan. They will help you go through modification to a certain extent, usually. Rarely, does a person need a negotiator to talk to the bank for them. If the bank wouldn't negotiate after a year of non-payment, it seems they would never negotiate, which is exactly what happened here.

Here's some food for thought. How long have they owned the home? More than 10 years? It's likely the bank would LOVE for the family to stop paying and foreclose on the house at that point. I'm gonna make up some numbers:
Lets say they bought the house for $100K, taking a loan for $90K
After 15 years, they only owe $60K
Meanwhile, the house is appreciating 4% per year and is now worth $180K

In that scenario, and the numbers in real life might be worse or better for your boyfriend's family, the bank would be able to sell the home and PROFIT $120K. They would be insane to renegotiate any loan when they could profit by letting the home go to foreclosure. I'm strongly suspecting something like that is what's taking place here, and is the reason the bank refuses to renegotiate.
 




 /u/hansSA is right. You need couples counseling. Here's the thing: you're in denial over your husband meeting a man for a gay relationship on match. That's understandable in this situation. What would never fly in any situation would be if I asked my SO to go to counseling because I perceived a problem in our relationship that I thought required professional help and my SO refused to go to counseling. Right then would be the time that I would look to get out of the relationship, because at that point I would know the person does not care about your feelings in the relationship.


Suggest couples counseling, and if he refuses, I would start looking for an out if I were you. 




 I would 100% mention that you do not live in the US and do not intend to return. That is the only leverage you have, because otherwise they will just wage garnish like they do with all the others. 




 

Since it is legal, and the original owner has no recourse, everyone should tweet/email/FB Spirit about how shitty they are for stealing this person's idea. 




 Thanks! 




 So I've read all the comments and I'm still not sure who the fighter is. 




 Oh gotcha. I see the argument both ways. Seems like the UFC and any other media need to define p4p next to the ranking. 




 Can you expand on your second definition? You just repeated "pound for pound." 




 "Yea, this will make us look real tough! Let's shove our fingers in their butts!"

I sincerely don't understand the logic sometimes. 




 Or repeat business if he just seals the cat in again! 




 Can you go to a therapist or perhaps have one come to you if you are unable to leave the house? You could do some therapy with the boyfriend and ultimately tell him with the therapist there. He would have someone to tell him "yes this is real and its not going to change" and also help him deal with his feelings on the matter. 




 Chael vs Vitor

I know people like to hate on Chael, but he's my guilty pleasure.

I thought he could wrestle Vitor and with it, I'm sure he would have gotten a title shot. I just want him to get the title he promised his dad he would get. (tear) 




 Could be any number of reasons. Maybe the suicidal man came to the window and pointed the gun at them and SWAT was outside the whole time. 




 Lots of times these kinds of waivers will not hold up in court. If there was a case of actual negligence you can still sue. 




 In bankruptcy, in most cases the court cannot take your house, or car. 




 They have been stripped of their firearms and are on suspension. It says it right in the article. It's standard procedure for any officer involved in a shooting. 




 I did that in middle school then they banned it. So I just had to be more sneaky ;) 




 Maybe it reflects upon them. But I would never assume the actions of an individual were with bad intentions merely because they belonged to a government organization where there had been stories of unlawful actions before.

You guys are literally assuming these guys are guilty until proven innocent. That's not how a society should operate. 




 Let's put you in that scenario. You're on the SWAT team that responded and the suicidal guy points a gun at you. Do you fire?

I would argue that any cop in that situation has "no choice" but to fire at the man. 




 The fact that you're referring to it's only what you've seen is the very definition of anecdotal evidence and therefore no air quotes are needed. 




 So you're going with the assumption that they are guilty until proven innocent, just to be clear? 




 I said "So are you just comfortable judging **this** SWAT team..." and you answered "Basically yeah..." and now you say "I wasn't specifying this SWAT team..."

You're backing out and spewing some good ol' fashioned cop hating, when all I'm doing is reiterating the point that none of us know the true facts and we shouldn't based our opinions of **this specific case** on a news report that doesn't give us the full story of what happened.

You have some good points, but your blanket hatred of all cops seem to have clouded your judgement. 




 These exact people on this SWAT team? 




 You don't know that these specific people on this SWAT team have done anything, unless you know something more than the rest of us. 




 Well I hope you never sit on a jury in that case. 




 I just don't understand how this is a rebuttal to Dolce. I think BJ had an off night and could have performed better. The fact that Dolce thinks he had amazing conditioning and was beating up the guys they brought in has nothing to do with that and why BJ blames Dolce for his loss blows my mind. 




 So are you just comfortable judging this SWAT team based on your preconceived notions with absolutely zero evidence? 




 Your story is nothing more than anecdotal evidence. It does not show it reflects the intentions of SWAT teams elsewhere.

Here, we don't have the full story. It is entirely possible the suicidal man got frustrated and aimed his gun at police who at that point would have no choice but to shoot him. Or its entirely possible something much like the scenario you described played out and they killed the guy on purpose. 




 I don't understand how people pick split decisions. Are you deciding the judges will suck? Or just that there will be a round that is a legitimate 100% toss up round?

If it's just close rounds then you'd pick the winner of the majority, no? 




 Aldo. Listen I'm not crazy, I know Aldo gasses. I know when he gasses he is susceptible to getting laid on (Hominick). I figure he'll stuff some TD's, maybe get taken down once or twice in the first two rounds but pop up soon enough where it doesn't count against him too much, and outstrike Mendes through the first 3 rounds to take them by a close margin, then get laid on for 4 and 5 but not finished from the bottom. 48-47 Aldo 




 I like how it took him 15 minutes to think of that last reply. Like he kept thinking of a follow up, but would erase it over and over thinking "no, that's not good enough" and THAT'S what he settled on?? 




 I'm not saying it's not possible but just be aware that there is a remote chance he was the beneficiary of a trust or his wife is or they won a small lottery, have a rich uncle or any other possibility. 




 Could the kid not wash it off themselves? 




 What was Rumble's deal? I remember Dana saying he was in danger of being permanently banned and I remember it was for what I thought was BS but I don't remember the specifics. 




 Before anybody bitches about it, the grammar in the title is correct. 









 I really thought that was going to end with "gay." Not that the premise would necessarily line up with the conclusion, but damn it just fits. 




 That ending. He was SO close to getting out. 




 It's quite possible he has a wealthy spouse or a trust fund or any number of other things. Just because someone's job has them making less money than they're spending does not always mean they are corrupt.

Have you considered that maybe since he's home by 2 every day that he's putting his time to good use and running a successful online business or something similar? 




 Wait, why? 




 Is this true? Can you cite a law, either Federal or state?

I just moved to California and nearly every single business here asks to see my ID when I pay with a credit card. 




 The first step would be talking to other employees and getting them to go with you to talk to a lawyer about the matter. Most likely, the other side will get audited by an independent accountant who will calculate the damages. 




 Of course, it's happening right now. China claims Taiwan, but many regulatory bodies recognize Taiwan as its own state and Taiwan did not win a war over China to gain independence. 




 Yep. 




 Thank you for taking the time to answer! 




 Disagree again. What if the UN and every other country in the world recognizes the new country but the host country refuses to go to war with the new country. In that case would you recognize that a Declaration would be a legal document? 




 I might be misunderstanding myfunnynamewastaken's question, but I think he's asking how one would know if they truly don't want to be an attorney whatsoever or if they're just having 1L blues. 




 Another 1L here: So does the lawyer for one side say the evidence is prima facie, then the other lawyer can rebut it and it's no longer prima facie? 




 What about nations that just declare their independence and do not go to war with their former host country? 




 ALL law was created at one point or another by its own institutions. You say emancipation is a legal process. The courts who made it a law gave itself that power. That is my argument for why the Declaration was a legal document.

Also, I never said anyone could reference the Declaration, only that  




 I guess we'll just have to disagree. I think one country formally declaring they are no longer part of another is inherently a legal procedure.

I would liken it to a minor declaring independence from a parent by emancipation, which I don't think you would disagree is a legal procedure. 




 My mistake on the source, however the Declaration most certainly is a legal document. It is breaking off connection from another country's rule. 




 Well I was just going by what the founding fathers defined as rights. 




 I completely disagree. Sweden doesn't have MORE of a right, they just have less chance of their right being taken away, an important distinction.

Nonetheless, for your Colorado example, the Constitution doesn't guarantee the degree of a right, only that there is that right. 




 Yes, there is a "right to life" even if we have the death penalty. I am arguing that the govt can validly take away rights. It's the user I was replying to that is arguing otherwise. 




 No, both are ok. I'm not arguing either is not ok. The power to veto is a check on power and is the very essence of our democracy, as is the power to filibuster. 




 Obama would never let that happen. He can manufacture a trillion dollar coin, simply order the debt payments continue as a matter of national security, or any number of other scenarios. Also the Republicans took a beating in the polls last time they pulled that stunt, and seem unlikely to try again.

Also, can you give me a source on him saying they would default if they won the Senate? I had not heard that. 




 No. How could it be? 




 Dana does, and he watches it the whole fight. You see it in a lot of his vlogs. 




 I guess the moral is, most challengers think you gotta have something extra up your sleeve if you wanna beat the best. 




 That's not true. There is a right to life, which can be taken away by the death penalty. There is a right to liberty, which can be taken away via a prison sentence. And there is a right to property, which can be taken away via seizure or eminent domain.

Were you thinking those weren't rights or that we shouldn't be able to have any of them taken away?
