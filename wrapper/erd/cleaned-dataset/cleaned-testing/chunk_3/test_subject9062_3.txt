 Couldn't agree more. The gunners in the US are killing this amendment by defending the current abysmal regulations situation; if, after a child is murdered in a massacre with a gun at school, the NRA folks came out with humanity and attempted to fix the loopholes and prevent such tragedies, I think people (me included) would relax . But instead they get more vicious; the things said to the parents of Sandy Hook victims were FUCKED.  









 We'll find that old Super 8 footage, you won't be able to Dodge_It. 




 Sounds like a Lisa Frank bomb went off 




 Those are special saws, right?  









 Purple monkey dishwasher Pizza! My Favorite!  
























 I've seen an upswing in shitty druggies (=meth) in my neighborhood and they seem to work in the oil fields. A neighbor rented a room to a young guy from the oil fields and the guy got arrested, and them my neighbor found a shitload of heroin packages in the guys room. Shady. As. Fuck. Hate that this element is growing here.  









 We are changing that shit. We lost 30 Americans a day to gun violence last year. That's a fucking plague.  




 In 2013 we lost 30 Americans a day to gun violence. That's a crisis.

Edit: ***thanks*** for my first gold! I'm so used to being derided for speaking out.  









 As part of their investigation, police will try to trace the gun using an existing serial number, Friedman noted, but the most likely explanation for Zehaf Bibeaus possession of the gun is that he purchased it on the black market or stole it from its original owner. If its the latter, the legal owner could face charges if he or she knew the gun had been taken and failed to report it to police. 









 Similarly we need a discussion about access to firearms without people immediately shutting down their brains decrying "personal freedom infringement". If someone has their passport taken away, and then voila has a firearm and bullets, the FIRST QUESTION should be how? Where did he get them? Track that shit and we'll stop this plague of gun violence. Track Every Gun and Track Every Bullet.  




 As well as a good number that join the KKK, the NRA and other extremist groups in North America.  




 What's the legality of a threat on the president?  







































 Though it's hard to be surprised by the gunners anymore, it does shock me that they are so shitty to Gabby Giffords. Her husband is an astronaut and she is a public servant. The gunners are fucking scum. When I think back to my childhood during the Reagan years I can't fathom anyone being given a mic to talk shit about someone in government who was shot in the face by someone who never should have been able to access a gun, and then tried to prevent it from happening to someone else.  














 I'm afraid this will become more common, as many yoga instructors seem to have gone from Teaching *yoga*, to Teacher Training on high-speed. It seems like a diploma-mill situation, where the teacher trainings bring in more money than classes, so teachers ALL seem to offer them, and then turn out new teachers like crazy. Odds are, even if most new instructors are good ones, we will end up with more and more freaks. OP, your instructor sounds like s/he's got a tin ear.  




 Please contact Lt. Jeff Manning of the Gilchrist County Sheriffs Office at (352) 463-3491 or Jmanning@gcso.us. Tell him you are terribly sorry that his community has had to endure this terrible tragedy. And then ask him if the .45-caliber handgun used by Don Spirit has been traced, and if it has been, where it was traced to. Spirit was a convicted felon who could not have passed a background check. 









 Brought him to his knees! 




 I think if the women in my family farted openly and laughed we might all be happier. Can we blame hidden farting on puritans?  




 Bravo!  
























 ...probably by a priest.  



















 Using an old book to persuade nuts that their interpretation of the book (which they consider magic) is wrong seems like the wrong approach. Like a scientist debating a creationist. If someone is not operating in reality it's pointless to use reason on them.  
























 Yes it is. The /r/guncontrol subreddit actually had to post instructions about how to see new posts because of the ammosexual down vote brigade. Fucking blood on their hands.  





























 This is why I support the gun control measures with my votes and my money, but I don't go to rallies or put myself in the line of fire. These so-called Open Carry groups are trigger-happy loons, our domestic terrorists. 
Until this recent spate of killings and open-carry demonstrations I was not for "taking their guns" - now, I am fully for it. Remove the guns from these fucks.  




 This is why weapons like guns are terrible for beings like humans.  














 Even those of us who got internet in our late teens are mostly NOT prude. The ones who are seem to be this weird Reagan spawn that came as a rejection of progress.  




 Fuck! 




 Take our gun nuts too please. 
USA 










































































 Absurd. Hope a lawsuit is swift in following this BS. Incredibly tired of the religious oppression of reason in our America.

 doing their jobs 


Except they aren't. They're protecting a killer who's yet to be arrested.  




 They're at home getting pedicures from the Koch Brothers and blow jobs from the NRA.  




 Aw shit. I was tying my shoe and my wife was eating oatmeal and both our guns accidentally went off. Oops! 














 A recent survey found U.S. law enforcement agencies considered sovereign citizens to be the top terrorist threat they faced. 





























 Right? And if a kid is murdered in kindergarten, or worse, a whole classroom full, we damned well better see protestors outside gun shops. Those are the death stores. Killing ALREADY ALIVE people everywhere.  




 The thing is, cars also transport people and can be used in ways that help lives. Guns only kill.  




 We don't! Let's close gun stores everywhere.  




 They do. With their childrens blood.
