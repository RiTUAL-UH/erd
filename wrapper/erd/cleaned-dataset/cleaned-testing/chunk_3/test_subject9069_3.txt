 I dunno. I'm just curious.  




 *Green face*?! It's not 1920 any more, you bigot pony! 

No, it's not okay just because you have a tortoise friend!  




 To my mind "Salad Fingers" was boring as hell because it was badly animated and had some lousy artwork, so it just seemed predictable that he'd go with creepy or whatever since it gave the impression he wouldn't be able to draw anything else. It was that or just have everyone say fuck or do the kind of juvenile humor that would appeal to Newgrounds people.  




 Then those terrible characters came in and ruined it.  




 ... But it's Halloween, so which of the ponies would you most like to pet? 

I get the impression you guys think it's an uncomfortable question from the reaction a bunch of commenters had to those Pony Simulator comics that doublewbrothers made.

 I think people were impressed by the fact the author did a good imitation of Jane Austen's writing style for the portions he added to Pride and Prejudice that pertain to zombies.  




 I don't think an author writing a similar followup  to their own book is a trend.

 I love my job except when I work in the kid's section because I don't like working with shelves of kid's books.  




 I'm a fan, I just don't like the kid's section.  




 Looking forward to it? High hopes? Pessimism? Indifference?  




 His work got a C   D order for being too off model.  




 I work at a library and love the hell out of my job. EXCEPT when I have to work the kid's section, because the books are so skinny and the shelves always so out of order that it takes forever to shelve anything. 

Today we got a big delivery of MLP books. A couple other librarians were talking about it, marveling about how they couldn't keep them on the shelves. One mentioned she saw this thing about how she learned there is non-pony MLP fanart (like when the Mane Six are drawn as donuts or whatever) and wondered aloud what else there might be. I  said "if it's a noun, there's a My Little version of it." And she was quiet for a second and then said "ARE YOU A BRONY!?" I said "not so loud." 

I thought then "Ah ha! Now she'll find me creepy and not let me work in the kid's section, but probably not enough to fire me!" I thought I was free of my least favorite part of my job. Then she said "I love you even more now!" 

Dammit! The ONE time I wanted it to make me look like I shouldn't be around kids!

 I interacted with them casually for a few weeks at least, then usually I say "hey, you want to go out sometime?" I might be trying too hard to sound like I'm not interested to not come off as desperate, but I get the impression it wouldn't help if I sounded more interested.

 I'm on rejection like nine of people I've asked out. All the times I didn't bother have just blurred together or been forgotten, but I remember all the rejections pretty vividly. That's not counting all the online ones but those don't really count. I really shouldn't have tried with the person I now see regularly at work, although I don't know if it's still awkward for her since possibly she doesn't remember. 

But I've got a job I love so I really can't complain. 

 




 FUCK no I wouldn't want to be a woman! Last thing I need is to have menstruation, body issues, and misogyny to deal with.  




 I'm a really flaky guy to help balance it out.  




 Thank you! 




 Is that a reference to stereotypical French snootiness or something?  




 I didn't reminisce about my childhood at all. I hated that experience. If they make an "Adulthood" movie in a few decades or so then I'd probably be reminiscing about my twenties and thirties by then.

 Yes. It's a good metaphor but it didn't scare me the way MP did.

 *The following document was forwarded to me from a person who works with the Minnesota State Hazardous Response Team. The informant said its extracted from a word document that is the only evidence that it was within their power to take from the scene of an unconventional, classified emergency action. The reason the informant gave for sharing this was that it might be in the public interest that word of the emergency be made available before official disclosure.*

Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum.

Im typing this in what was a cabin in Cook County, Minnesota. Its forty miles of wilderness to the nearest town and at least ten miles to the nearest other cabin. Youll hear all about the place soon on the news. Or maybe not. I dont mind much either way anymore. Its more likely youll hear some version of what happened to me, eventually. Theres a reason I had to go to a place like this to hide my face while I waited to disappear. Theyll want there to be some version of what happened to me to tell the public.

This started three days ago. The fridge started making a horrible grinding noise, so I got the manual out. There was no phone to call a repairman for it and I dont have a connection to the internet, or I would probably have tried to get in touch with someone a thousand times already during my lonely periods. Anyway, the manual said it was a problem with the vents in the back around the fan getting clogged. I pulled the fridge from the wall, removed the vent cover, and saw that the fan was surrounded with dust and hair. I cleaned it out.
I might not have noticed the moss then, but I was so bored at the time that I decided to clean it much more thoroughly than necessary. I felt along the bottom of the metal frame housing the fan and then recoiled. I thought Id electrocuted myself for a second, but I knew that what Id felt was not electricity from past experience with hotwiring.

I felt it again. It was smooth, warm, and soft. It was quite similar to human flesh. And there was something else about the thing I felt down there that differentiated it from any known mold.

There was a pulse like you can feel at someones neck or wrist. Id felt pulses enough back in the day that it was the first place my mind went when I felt that sensation. And along with it, I felt a very light spray emit from it, like if you squirted cologne on yourself from way too far away.

I tried to tear it out and get a look at it, but it was too firmly attached. Frustrated, I went and got some drain cleaner which dissolved the patch quickly. When I cleaned out the remnants it a red sludge. It was just like the leftovers from when I and my associates used lye on a body.

Like many things in my life I was able to rationalize that pretty easily. There were probably plenty of molds I wouldnt recognize. I knew I had seen red funguses somewhere on television or something. The pulse could have been my own. If you use your thumb when taking someones pulse, youll end up feeling your own. I convinced myself Id felt something similar to that.

Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum.

Taking off the gloves after the last of the sludge went down the sink, I realized I hadnt washed my hand before putting on the glove after I felt that faint spray. I absent-mindedly sniffed it weakly. It smelled surprisingly good. Like chocolate and flowers. Of course I washed it off, but I was surprised at the time that it smelled so nice. In fact, I felt a little happier than I would have expected after washing it off.

Early the next morning, when there was just enough light to make the inside of my cabin a dark blue, I heard the fan for the fridge again make a horrible grinding noise. I stumbled out of bed, pulled the fridge away from the wall again, unplugged it, and then I froze. I could smell chocolate and flowers.

I thought I might have been smelling things and maybe seeing things through bleary eyes. A glass of water sounded like what I needed to clear my head. I drank half a glass then poured the rest out. Although I couldnt see into the sink properly in the weak light, I realized there was no gurgle of the water draining.
I turned on the light above the sink and saw it.

There was a mass that had grown out of the drain. It was slowly, rhythmically expanding and contracting slightly like it was breathing. A large blue vein was visible, straining against the skin.

I bent down to get the drain cleaner. My hands were trembling as I tried to unscrew the lid. Even then, I knew it was useless. What I had done yesterday had merely left this thing to regrow in the u-pipe or somewhere. Surely pouring more drain cleaner onto an even greater mass would hardly stop the growth. But it was all I could think to do at the moment.

As I poured a bit of drain cleaner onto the moss, its surface spasmed. It released a powerful spray of whatever that scent was. I couldnt force myself to keep pouring. I was became fully relaxed even as I stood there trying to kill some being of skin. The moss gradually stopped spasming even as the drain cleaner slowly stopped eating through it. It seemed, at least to me, like it was relaxing too. It released more of that wonderful scent.

Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum.

Its okay. I understand. Im not mad at you. Thats what it felt like it was trying to communicate to me. Even then I knew I should have tried to tear out the plumbing or leave the cabin for somewhere else on foot, but I wanted more of that scent. I felt the best I had since Id started hiding up here.

I stood over the sink for a while, just breathing in that odor. I could no longer care what was in that spray which calmed me so. I looked over at the fridge vent. I could see little bits of the flesh moss growing out through the vents.

Since then, the moss grew and grew faster as it went. It now coats the inside of the cabin like soundproofing, For how loud it is, the sound of the mosss pulse is very relaxing, like the nature sounds people play to help them sleep. Its the badum sound Ive found myself typing a few times as I write this. I imitate the sound with my mouth as I do.

Acid is beginning to leak from large pores on this flesh moss. Its not strong enough to eat through metal but anything organic that it touches is being dissolved. The soles of my boots are almost gone now. I can feel the skin on the bottom of my feet beginning to be eaten away as well. But what matters most is that the moss has continued to spray that wonderful scent even as it releases acid. Im in pain, yet I dont mind.

The mosss pulse is speeding up. I think it wants to digest me faster. I am considering lying down in the acid to help speed it along. Its the least I could do for it.

Badum, badum, badum badum badum badum badumbadumbadumbadumbadumba

 




 I'm legitimately beginning to think of tiny, unoriginal horror shorts like these as "twist porn." It's not scary, it's not believable, it's only supposed to be interesting because it's ostensibly surprising.  




 http://listverse.com/2014/10/14/10-of-the-strangest-things-beetles-can-do/

I have no idea why he went for specifically beetles instead of insects in general, but whatever.  




 Huh. I thought they'd require a W-2, paystub, or somethin, but alright.  




 I was paid for this other small gigs through paypal. What paperwork would I need claiming that other pay?  




 But why design it so it seems like he's looking over my shoulder instead of at me?  














 Clearly a shared universe. Be ready for plenty of surprise cameos! 




 Let me guess: It's the story where there's a doppelganger under the bed.  














 I heard from an industry insider that Richard Williams was threatening to miss his deadlines on Who Framed Roger Rabbit and at the end he was effectively fired but had handed the animation long enough (plus Union rules) that he got the Oscar anyway. Anyone know if that's true?  




 Yes, it's very obvious what the premise of the original strip is. My point was that the bonus panel didn't put a humorous spin on it or anything.  




 Moments in movies where a camera movement or the way a scene was lit  made you laugh. 

One moment that comes to mind for me was Tropic Thunder.

SPOILERS

Ben Stiller's character is taken hostage and forced to sort of perform as his character Simple Jack. He is put in a humiliating outfit and constantly beaten to do so. When his rescuers arrive, he says he doesn't want to leave because he's finally found his audience. When he says that, there's a shot of him where there's a light on his face that makes him look kind of movie menacing. It was hilarious to me the contrast between his slapstick treatment and how now he was feeling empowered and menacing.  




 By contrast, I just saw a kid kicking a dragon puppet in the library and was  unwilling to do anything. He might still be at it for all I know.  




 Wow, there's no joke. Just self-hatred.  




 "Purposely put the trailer?" How would he do that accidentally?  









 Edited OP to clarify question.  




 I have a really dumb one: when I was like seven or so I watched this movie called Jingle All the Way where Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a busy dad who tries desperately to get his kid a toy. I must have bought way too much into the idea that the dad was neglectful, because there's a scene where Schwarzenegger has to pick his kid from out of a crowd to give him a toy, and I seriously worried "Oh no, is Schwarzenegger going to be able to remember his kid's *name*?!" That or I was weird as hell.   




 What's something where later thinking about a movie, you found yourself saying or thinking "I thought _________!" and couldn't believe it later? 




 Is this a reference?  




 I really didn't get that. Isn't that going to make them enormously more expensive and risky, going to clash with your expectations, make it harder to sell the special effects, etc. When your target audience is usually kids or nostalgic adults anyway, wouldn't you assume they'd prefer the look of a cartoon if the cartoons became classics anyway? 

Sure, it paid off a few times like when movies like George of the Jungle became hits, but it seems like the risks and bombs would outweigh that.  

EDIT: I mean, why, if you're going to reboot a franchise, would you adapt it live action instead of as a cartoon? I should have clarified that more. I certainly get the nostalgia aspect.  




 I move around and change identities. 

Just imagine how unpleasant it would be to think you would be immortal your whole life well into like your thirties, and then to find out you weren't because you just got diagnosed as terminal.  














 Ah, but inimitable by children, so they'll allow it.

 Ive been an atheist for a long time, and I spent a long time trying to get my mother to see the light. She never seemed to pass up an opportunity to buy a new book or dvd by Joyce Meyer or some other self-help huckster who would tell her what she wanted to hear about needing to stop worrying and put her faith in God. I tried to convince her that God as a concept was irrational, that her religion was built on lies and bad ethics.
 
That stopped yesterday. 

Mom called me up out of the blue and pleaded for me to come over. When I arrived, I let myself in and saw she had taken everything Christian she owned, from bibles to plates with The Last Supper on them, broken it all, and assembled it all into a cross in the middle of the living room. There was blood drying on some of the broken glass. 

Mom, what is this?! . 

Dustin, she called from her bedroom, I need you to pray! I was getting out my phone to get an ambulance while jogging to her bedroom. The door was locked. 

Unlock this door, Mother! 

Pray!  Really, truly, pray! She screeched at me. I paused and whispered a prayer that Mom be okay. I have never regretted doing anything more in my life. I have never felt secure, alone, or hopeful since then.

There was a voice that reverberated from inside my head while I stood outside her room. 

*Be not afraid, but I bring you dark tidings.*  









 These images have clearly been doctered.  




 So, those are different subsections in the aisle? 

I don't want to think about the difference between a MLP toy and something that's specifically a Brony toy.   




 What's that from?  




 So they couldn't get the guy that played Vern Schillinger for this photo?  




 Let's hope it doesn't have the same infuriating ethically blinkered ending that Close Encounters does.  




 http://listverse.com/2014/09/30/10-bizarre-ways-murderers-screwed-up/

I'm sure we've all heard about Dennis Rader by now, but I hadn't known that was how Ed Gein was caught.  




 Okay, fixed.  




 Up there, 

there is so much room, 

looking down on Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom, 

I wouldn't have to fear Fluttershy's stare, 

up there!  




 You... really don't want to know what Rarity is doing under that helmet.  




 A. A Christian is drowning in the sea. A boat comes up the crew tries to save them, but he says "no, God will save me!" Later another boat comes up and tries to save him again, but he insists that God will save him. Later a third boat comes along. The Christian is wheezing, gasping, almost exhausted, but manages to wheeze out "no, God will save me!" Then he drowns. In Heaven, he asks God why he didn't save him. God says "I sent you three boats!" 

B. An atheist is drowning in the sea. Getting desperate, he says to himself "Okay, God, I know I've never believed in you before, but if you save me, I'll not only become a believer, I'll become the best believer. I'll go to church, do my best to never sin. Please save me." Then a boat suddenly appears out of nowhere with a crew getting their life saving equipment ready. The atheist says "Never mind, God: I got this!"  




 Okay, is the appeal here supposed to be sadistic glee that someone gets to annoy a person professionally obligated to tolerate them? Like, is this porn for douchebags who wish they weren't too cowardly to personally treat people in this shitty manner?  




 I finally saw this film and I couldn't believe how forced and overwritten some of the dialogue was. Like "fuck me gently with a chainsaw" roles terribly off the character's tongue when just "fuck me gently" would have been so much more natural and quotable. 

Did the screenwriter ever claim that the dialogue was supposed to be like some sort of satire of kids trying to sound cool? Is there any indication the lines were supposed to be legitimately cool? Dean is clearly supposed to be a deconstruction of the idea of being cool and edgy, so I thought the idea was kinda legit.  




 John Landis supposedly doesn't like it either. But apparently George Romero is fine with it for his movies since when he first watches movies it's either through an eyepiece or through a monitor, so technically all movies are directed on a basis of being made for television.  




 Is the chickenbutt thing really a joke though? I think of it more as a Dadaist commentary on language.  




 I understand most people would probably assume that they are having a sensory problem of some sort, but you would not believe under any circumstances that it's God communicating with you, right?  









 Pretty much just on the show.  




 This might be a private hangup, but I enjoy the visual design of the show so much that even when curtains are torn up or vases are broken it kinda peeves me a little. Yes I admit it would completely ruin it even as a kid's show if nothing could be wrecked or damaged, but I still don't like it.  




 So, is it funnier than the first one or better animated?  




 She learned how to hot wire the Twinkling balloon long ago.  









 Grrr... We hate Adventure Time!!

(Right?)  




 To be fair, knowing Arthur Conan Doyle's spiritualist beliefs, he probably didn't care too much about the real laws of physics anyway.  




 Oh alright, I'll give them another chance. Thanks for the thought.

 God, that original ending would have made it my favorite movie of the year.  









 Awesome! I love mods.  









 A lot of my favorite ones still seem intact, like the ones about The Other Side of Midnight being used to persuade theaters to screen the movie or the special effects department only producing one usable shot after one year.  




 I recently tried How Did This Get Made? and hated it because they seemed to make the same jokes over and over (i.e. a character's autistic if the character's underacted, one of the hosts will say he jerks off to something, etc.) and the podcast We Hate Movies for the same reason (they constantly say "who gives a shit" and any adult that interacts with a child is a predator no matter what.) 

So, what are some good alternatives?  









 He went to the school of hard knockoffs.  




 It actually was kind of bad voice acting. Some of her word emphasis was so unnatural that it was uncomfortable.  




 This is so well animated that it's annoying how awkward some of Fluttershy's dialogue is written and delivered and how the humor needed work.  









 Just lower your standards. It's gotta work eventually.  




 As a free-spirited student who's too cool for school, I say yes.  




 Normal.  









 It probably wouldn't be so slowly paced with lingering shots on uninteresting bits and ends in Spencer's room, so it'd have to be a step up (I like Eraserhead, but I imagine most people's biggest problem with it is the pace.)  




 Bet they went there right out of their parents' basements.  




 An image of a police officer not being portrayed as Satan got upvoted? How'd that happen?  




 If so, how did you react? Did you immediately get resent the manipulation? Did you not care? 



 




 Nah, it's genuinely clever and witty IMO. But then, I am a psycho hillbilly.  




 She might as well claim it's a parody so that she can publish it with fair use protection.  









 Exact opposite for me. My elementary school experience sucked because my parents had way more money troubles then, fought more, and my mildly abusive brother lived with us. 

Foreveralone doesn't seem so bad sometimes.  









 So this is funny because he claimed to be drunk? 




 I would not. Science kinda has my back on that one: http://www.forbes.com/sites/olgakhazan/2011/09/12/is-listening-to-audio-books-really-the-same-as-reading/
 




 http://listverse.com/2014/09/25/10-movies-sabotaged-by-their-own-creators/

Few novel stories in there, a few which are kinda samey. I think the one for Un Chien Andalous is the most interesting but don't watch the clip unless you're already kinda jaded.  




 Probably novelty value. If it didn't look weird and/or creepy, we wouldn't be talking about it.  




 Being a sociopath doesn't mean you're cool as a cucumber under pressure or don't have a sense of self-preservation. 

That said, Dahmer had supposedly been living a lie pretty much his whole life by then, so he probably thought he knew how to handle it. 

 









 The joke was that Pratchett's anger would drive him to just spitefully kill off the cast of his greatest success.  









 CGP Grey rambled on his podcast recently about how in his opinion the ideal way to go into a movie was completely cold. Like, discovering it at home, comfortable on the couch, coasting through Netflix recommendations, not even reading the summaries.
