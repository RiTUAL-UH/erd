 Awesome! It takes like 4-6 weeks to get to you. Can't wait to get mine in the mail :D 




 I just made one for my family. It is too cute! :D 









 Yeah it's the nighttime fireworks at MK. 




 Wishes. And crying during the Wishes. 




 I don't know I thought it was a good question. 
 




 I still remember being leashed. :(
 




 That's awesome to hear! :D Thanks! [[96 DAYS :D]] 




 I haven't been yet, but my SO and I have reservations to Akershus in the Norway Pavilion in May and that looks pretty good. They have a cold bar that everyone has access to and then a nice looking menu you order from. The cold bar has some shellfish, cured meats and cheeses from Scandinavia. There are some wonderful sounding Scandinavian entrees as well that we are excited about! I should mention that Akershus is a Princess meal.

 Important question re the new Bluray edition: Did they get rid of Morrison's Boba Fett redub? :/ 




 *claps* 




 Yeah, that's what my W2 says, not counting SS/Medicare. 




 What? No wai. ;____; 




 It says 969.63. I'm beginning to suspect my W4 is not right, and I got lucky last year. 




 Alright, just me then. Thanks! 




 I changed jobs in 2013, but there wasn't any space between them. That is an awesome tool! Our accountant at work advised me to redo my W4 and I will definitely be using that. Thanks! 




 Can you claim yourself as a dependent? I have never found a satisfactory answer to that. I just learned I can get tax help through my employer so I will go that route too because I don't know how much information I feel comfortable putting on reddit. :) 




 Oh, okay. Thanks for explaining. 




 I have more student loan interest this year, because I just rehabilitated them (yay for me!). I haven't finished filing yet, but I did not pick dependent. 




 What else do you need? I'm new at this. 




 I have excellent health insurance provided by my employer, which I pay a small amount for each month. Does that cover me? 




 That's a good suggestion. I'll try that when I get home! 




 Credit! I'm sorry. That's my bad. My only CREDIT was student loan interest. I did take the standard deduction. 




 Background: I make less than 25K, single lady with no kids. I am not in school, I work full time for a public university. GREAT benefits. 

I owe $470 on my tax return. This is a substantial amount of money for me, and it's going to decimate the small savings I have managed to put by. Last year, I got a small refund. My income and withholding, as stated, has not changed. I'm confused and sad. :( 

I just put everything through a Federal Free Edition on Turbotax, and my only credit was for Student Loan Interest. 

TLDR: ELI5 why it's different so I don't get pissy and mail off a bunch of pennies. Please and thank you. 3

Edit- Changed deduction to credit 




 You have to cancel these at least 24-48 hours in advance, so maybe someone is sitting on a reservation until it gets closer and they have to really decide which they want. Keep trying! I was able to make one last week for breakfast on May 6 so it could definitely happen! Keep trying and May the Force Be With You. 




 I like this idea. 




 Fett. Boba Fett. 




 Rebels is great for families. Not too scary for kids, enough stuff to be interesting to adults too. 




 Star Wars Land (ohpleaseohpleaseohplease) 




 I love it! His expression really makes the shot.
 




 On our upcoming trip, we will have two-day passes with Park Hopper, and HS is the only one I plan on visiting twice. :D We love Disney, but we are just as excited about Star Wars!! 




 All of them. You can get GBA ones and play those on the Lite. Start with Fire Red or Leaf Green.
 




 Thanks for the tip. I think that's what we have decided to do. Better safe than sorry! 




 I appreciate the tip! :) 




 Awesome!! I didn't know you could try more than one thing. :D 

It is a little pricey, but I keep telling myself how many awesome benefits there are to it. :3 

How was the food? 




 Awesome, thanks. We really just wanted to bring the hilts to wear around, since our blades don't collapse. That's an awesome story about the sonic screwdriver! :D 




 That's awesome to hear to hear! I've never done a character meal before, but we are so looking forward to it! Thanks! :) 




 Does anyone know if there is a policy on this? My boyfriend and I are going in May (and we have the Star Wars Character breakfast reserved!) and we were wondering if we could wear our sabers. Thanks! :D

They are high quality dueling sabers, but we would leave the blades in the hotel of course!! 




 So if we booked yesterday, the price shouldn't change, right? First time bookers here, Thanks! 




 Thanks I managed to arrange something and will use that next time :) 




 Hey guys, I have an extra samurai from set 13 that I'd really love to trade for the fencer. Please let me knew if anyone would like to do this trade! :) Thanks! 




 Thanks for making me cry at work. ;~;
 




 Try an app like My Fitness Pal. It will let you know if you are not eating enough, and you can add your friends on the app for extra encouragement. I lost 40 lbs with it a couple years ago. You can do iiiiiit! :D 




 Ohhhhh boy movie night at u/Cheezy_fingers house!

Don't eat the Doritos, tho. 




 Personally, I always prefer to have my office building locked when someone is there by themselves. Anyone who is supposed to be there can get in with a keycard. I always make sure it is locked whenever I leave someone on their own no matter who it is.  




 Only if it is hairy arms Rob Lowe.
 




 Totally read that as Elven Warriors
 




 Username is appropriate
 




 Georgia Southern fills Paulson, just sayin. 









 Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck 




 Well these bulldogs will not be breeding any more per se... :P 









 Any of them. :'(
