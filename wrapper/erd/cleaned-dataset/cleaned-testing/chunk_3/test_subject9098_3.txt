 Wha...what's the point of taking all the time to make this when you're just going to eat it a few hours later? 














 Only 303 views of the video as of me writing this, but 555 comments on here?  So apparently only a few people on reddit even watch the video before commenting on it? 




 "How does a human notice that" - Wouldn't it seem more natural to say person instead of human?  Or is the comment from some alien race? 




 There was a time lapse video on yahoo this past week showing the entire progress of the tower.  It was pretty cool to watch. 














 Should have used obtuse instead of stupid. 




 It's a rug, not carpet. 




 Purchase bullets for each shot made in game. 




 My co workers are this way.  It's impossible to get a sentence in as a response. 









 I was referencing one on the advice animals front page using cats that I know has been used before.  As I'm sure mine has been used before too. 









 My brothers and I wonder what we're going to do with our title belts after 2049 for Wrestlemania.  That's as far as the pre programmed dates go. 




 And Miners Cave for me! 









 So who else looked real close to find the one country that said something other than "people"? 









 So you are showing her that prayer actually does work? 




 I loved the original game, but unfortunately never played through it all.  The time and amount of load screens was unbearable.  I would love a remake it that was taken care of! 




 But why did you each make a full sandwich on your own and then put it on the earth?  You should have each just used 1 piece of bread with toppings on one side and put that on the ground.

 a brief history of [Playstation controllers](http://imgur.com/1GHkf). 




 I was always aware that running at an angle was faster, but how do you know the speed difference as being 1.41? 




 I beat him this way as well since I didn't know about the controller port change. 




 One could only hope that is what his activities involve. 









 Good luck making that cash.  That comes out to 62.5 smudges you'd have to average per minute.  so roughly one per second. 




 Sorry, I don't watch the show myself, so I'm not sure what websites might have it posted for you to watch. 




 Now if you use this at work, is there a way it can block your internet browsing activity from the company too? 




 New episode this coming Wednesday after the new South Park actually. 









 Looks like OP spelled Taco Bell wrong. 




 Had the same thing when I was younger.  Now I've got the dvd in place of it. 




 I know it's no building, but an [elevator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator) is a start. 




 Repost, of course. 




 I have never worked at a small local pizza place, but I agree with you.  I grew up in NW Ohio where all the towns were small (~1,200 people) and the price of pizza is around what you are saying. 




 So was OP sitting in a shopping cart also when taking the bottom picture? 









 He doesn't look very happy.  Must have to go to work for the day.

 Donkey Kong Country Returns 




 Did you say [2-ply toilet paper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EE01Sbb8CU)?  It's at the very end, just wait for it. 




 True, the opening sequence would show it before each episode, but we were thinking in the actual show. 




 My brother and I were wathcing an episodes of King of the Hill last night and he brought up the fact that he couldn't think of a single episode where there wasn't at least one alcoholic beverage (usually beers in the alley) drank.  He's more of a fan than I am of the show, but I was trying to think of one as well and could come up with an episode.  Anyone know if there is a way to verify something like this?

 Just start clicking and eventually you find your way to safety at the end and everything is finally explained about what happened. 














 If Midway's building was on fire, this would make sense to all of us. 









 Read this on my phone and kept rotating it to read easier. The damn meme kept rotating with the screen and I couldn't win! 














 Exact same thing I was thinking. 




 Michigan....sorry to hear that. 




 You mean the long long ago. 




 Everyone has to start at the bottom!
