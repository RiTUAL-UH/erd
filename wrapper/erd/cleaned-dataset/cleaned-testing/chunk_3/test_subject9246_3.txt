 It has "Schick" written on the case and the end of the handle. I've done some research and I think it is a Schick Krona, but not real certain. I've been lurking on here for awhile, doing research before I went and bought my first razor, but then I found this while on vacation and impulsively purchased it. Is this a good choice for a first razor, or should I look for an alternative?  









 I've found that keeping my hands busy really helps me. Lately, including tonight, whenever I feel restless and in need of a distraction, I grab some hemp and make a bracelet. Something about the different knots and the repeating motion is soothing and helps distract me and calm me down. 




 Sounds exactly like my past two days. Hope yours goes better. If you need someone to talk to, I'm a good listener.  




 I may regret this, but all jokes are welcome.
I've been feeling down all day, so if it makes me laugh - I'm game. 




 I'll pick someone at 9:00pm Eastern Time


*Update

Thank you everyone for all of your jokes, they have brightened up my night. I was unable to just pick one, so I've selected ClassyAssBitch and johannvaust. I've messaged them and waiting to hear back.


**Update ClassyAssBitch has received their gift card. Still waiting on johannvaust 




 I tried to make some a couple years ago and forgot to grease and powder the pan. Trust me when I say that is the most important step.  




 I live about a mile from campus and walk, unless the weather is really bad or I'll be on campus way past dark. I hate when circumstances arise where I feel like I need to drive. I end up having to leave earlier because otherwise I won't find a spot, or students walking will cause me to sit at a stop sign for a solid 5 minutes. On top of that, there is the problem of feeding the meter every two hours so I don't get a ticket. Driving to campus really is more of a hassle than walking.  




 My roommate and I are both vegetarians. When we need our fast food fix we go to BK for the veggie burgers. Asking for a whopper with the vegetarian meat is my favorite.  




 I'm 22 and still have some servers treat my friends and I like shit because they think college kids tip poorly. I have always tipped upwards of 25% or more for good service, but if a server is terrible - I'm not afraid to leave as little as 5% tip.  




 I'm terrified of all dogs. I'm that person that would jump in front of a car to avoid a dog - big or small. Growing up I wasn't around dogs, and thus they make me kind of nervous. Maybe they lady wasn't breedist, just uncomfortable. Just a possibility. :)  




 I deleted my Facebook awhile ago and traded it in for linkedin. I'm connected to people still and in a much more useful way.  




 If I recall correctly, it ended when he went off to college.  









 Did that when I moved into my first apartment. Luckily the maintenance man was a genius and prepared for all the idiot college kids moving in and had his truck loaded with towels and some magical spray that more or less killed the soap bubbles.  




 One of my best experiences was at Wendy's. There was an older gentleman working and I asked if it were possible to have a sandwich with no meat. Many times I've been charged full price for a meatless sandwich. This guy went out of his way to get me a deal. Punched in the items individually and put it on a Jr sized bun, was about 70 cents and I think I had cheese on it as well.  




 Books.

I have a thing about owning the books I read, so I hardly go to the library. I have a favorite used bookstore I frequently visit and if I have the intention of purchasing 1 specific book, I leave with at least 2 others.

When I buy a house, first thing I'll do is convert an entire room into a library. So at least my hoarding will be in a central location?  




 I'm paying my own way through college. I'm a full time student and I work 35-40 hours a week. If I had the option to have my parents pay for my school, I'd accept in a heartbeat.

For the most part I'm indifferent to people who have parents that pay for their college. I've met a lot of different people in school, some that have their school paid for through loans, through scholarships, by working, or from their parents. How someone pays for school doesn't define them though. A good friend, coworkers, etc. wouldn't change how they think of you because of this.

The only time I've had any issues with someone who has parents paying for their school, is when they act spoiled about it.

As long as you don't walk around bragging about it, it's nothing to be ashamed of. 

TL;DR
I think they are pretty damn lucky.  




 I'm assuming you use a wood burning tool and then just spray it with clear polyurethane and it stays nice? Will it ever rot or should it last forever (or a lifetime)?  




 Did you text the number?  




 Thought I had it figured out, texted the number and apparently I'm not as good at math as I thought I was. Trying to figure out where I went wrong. :/  




 Maybe I'm reading this wrong, but were you the one to find your mother and discover she had died? As a five year old that must have been pretty traumatic and could have played a roll in not having you attend the funeral.  




 Glad it turned out alright! :)  




 I'm not an ASL major or minor, but took ASL 101 for kicks and giggles, and really enjoyed it. Had Kevin and he is awesome. I need a few more credits before I graduate in May and decided to take ASL 100 with him because I enjoyed his class so much.  




 As a broke college kid, I love Christmas for the same reason. That and small used book stores. I saw some people recommended going to the library, but there is something about having books of your own that feels so good.  




 Sometimes people cave. It's a personal choice. My family made prime rib for dinner last night. My older brother made it (an amazing cook) and it took so much will power not to eat any. Every side dish was vegetarian though, so that helped. 

I've caved, I know I'm new to this whole thing, and I accept I'll slip up sometimes. My reasons for being pescatarian aren't moral reasons, so if I slip and eat meat I just start over and try again. 

Tell your fiance you love him, but were really hungry and what you eat is your decision. :) 




 I'm sorry, that puts a damper on the holidays. Hope you have a merry Christmas and enjoy the time with your family despite grandma trying to trick you. :)  




 I've taken my own food with me places. All summer I kept vegetarian canned soup/pasta and microwaveable vegetarian items in my car because I never knew where I'd be when I was hungry and didn't want to burden the person I was dating with having to feed me. When I go to bbqs I always bring my own veggie burgers. I never expect someone to make accomidations for me, but appreciate it when they do. However I didn't grow up vegetarian and made this change after I had moved out on my own. When people order pizza, they generally get half a pizza with what I want on it. I'd suggest talking to your fiance's family and asking about being more vegetarian friendly. Maybe they don't understand it or don't know what to make.
