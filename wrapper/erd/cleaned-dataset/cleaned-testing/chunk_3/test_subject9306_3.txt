 Is it just me or does tiled floor + socks + chasing cat seem like a bad idea? 




 Elaborate? 




 Please enlighten me on the correct wording of the joke as it would please you. 

And I live with several engineering students, all of whom never shut up about it.  




 Yeah, of course it's in the USA.  




 How do you know someone is an engineer?

They'll tell you.  




 So really you're not like any of them.  




 The accident being that western society developed in the way that you described, and not in some other way.  




 No. INDIVIDUALS run the world. The fact that most of these happen to be men is an accident of western history. There are just as many men who need help for various things as women.  




 I've been told in the past that being called cute is actually a bad thing - it means you're passable but don't have the confidence that women find truly attractive to be 'hot/sexy.' Any women care to clarify? 




 Dude. Normal-shaped girl with just a leeeetle bit of belly = HOT. So much more than a flat stomach.  




 Amazon's amazing for posters. I got some massive and good quality musical theatre posters for like $7 (AUD) each.  




 I think it's supposed to be 'barefooted,' but people have a habit of dropping past tenses when they talk about concepts. 

r/linguistics can probably explain these things with much more accuracy.  




 That's a harsh school if you got in trouble for being 37 seconds late.  




 How exactly did that happen? Did she force you to have vaginal sex with her? 




 Apparently sounding intelligent is very attractive. You should keep doing whatever you were doing.  




 That's absolutely awful. But since you mentioned the babysitter was female, what is your gender? 




 Like any scientific study, regardless of the language used to describe it.  




 Neither of those were really directed at you - the first obviously because you're not hideous and gross. The second means that the man in question is backing off and not displaying his (still ever-present) interest because he is getting none from the girl in return. Most guys are interested in all females they know (that meet the attractiveness of point one) all the time, and are simply hedging their bets by showing only their interest in those who respond the most. There is no 'friend zone' or non-attractiveness-related reasons for lack of interest, as there often is from the female perspective. As you're displaying a lot of interest (I certainly hope you are) you don't have this problem.  




 There's really no such thing as a male initiated friendzone. It's either a) I don't want to bang her because she's unattractive or b) she displays little interest in banging me right now, so I'm shelving the project until further budget of interest is acquired.  




 I'm agreeing with now that you've specified your answer to mean in the realms of sexuality and attractiveness. Your first was a little too broad - and, honestly, came off as very sexist - which is why I think people were offended.  




 Well laa di daah 




 It is so much vastly easier for women to be attractive than men.  




 Please elaborate on how this could be possible? 




 most men do a better job with children

Can you elaborate on this for my curiosity please? 




 That being said, don't let sex become your only goal - regardless of your morality, I've seen plenty of advice on here that aiming for sex alone in a night (and not just to have fun) will ruin your game long-term 




 Which means the only direction is up.  




 TEN POINTS FROM GRYFFINDOR 




 As Achilles, I can confirm this. 




 Implying sex is the only goal and the only worthy conclusion 




 Or unless laws make the risk outweigh the reward.  




 Which would be like teaching that green shells are the only shells, and scientists developing blue shells are demons trying to corrupt you.  




 In all seriousness, who has such self confidence that they don't compare themselves to anyone else, or are ever jealous of somebody's looks or abilities? It's not possible, and a little bit of self introspection and humility can be healthy.  




 Four of my five roommates happen to be female with boyfriends, and the one dude is out right now. So I'm no sure that would go down too well. But thanks for the suggestion.  




 I'm naked right now, so thank you 




 Some places have preschool before kindergarten.  




 No, you were already downvoted.  




 He's just jealous because he's a 13 year old that won't have sex for a loooong time.  




 By the number of perfectly acceptable posts I saw on 0 at the bottom of the thread, I'm guessing some prudish prick is downvoting everything involving underage sex.  




 Wait wait wait... you say you were a *virgin* the first time you had sex? Wtf? 




 I hate to sound like Skittles11, but could you elaborate on how oral sex happened at 7?! 




 I'm gonna go ahead and guess that happens because it's funny.  




 Does this extent to all substantial facial hair, or just the bushy variety? 




 Shy people and introverts don't 'hate' people. They occasionally need some space, and don't like loud, hyper-social environments. 

This does not mean that they are sociopaths.  




 That is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard. 

Please, do explain how do you came to this conclusion.  




 Are you saying that shy people are mentally unstable? 




 I saved the comment, just so I never forget 




 Thank you! 




 Like you? 




 And you're really fixing that with your mature and constructive response.  




 Confident people can have self-doubt. Self-introspection is often the difference between confidence and arrogance.  




 I'm going to dispute you on unattractive girls being able to win men with confidence. I personally don't find confidence as a positive or a negative, and I know plenty of men who prefer shy girls. I would have no problems 'finding a reason to say yes' to an unattractive girl who approached me.  




 Post-orgasm, after we've laid there and chilled for thirty seconds, I always flip her over and give her a back massage. She says it's incredible. I'm pretty sure she now has sex with me just for the backrub.  




 If he has that little confidence in himself, of course she's going to look for better options. It's just unattractive.  




 The guy just sounds jaded that he is no longer attractive or putting enough effort into a relationship to keep her attention. Not only is this his fault, but it also goes both ways - women should thus be equally worried about men using their smartphones to find better options. So, as always, what it comes down to is not becoming complacent and taking your significant other for granted. Regardless of whether it's the 2nd century or the 20th.

 And boring. All their good jokes have been used up.  




 HI THERE!

FTFY 




 inb4 countertenors, castrati, and anyone singing in falsetto  




 I got better.  




 Do you know what 'delenda est' means?

Cato the Elder is turning in his grave.  




 I am both aware and a user of reddit on my phone. But thank you.  




 Hah, GAAAAY 




 This is what I struggle with the most about r/seduction - the ideal presented, and what women seem to find attractive, is frankly repulsive to me. I actually want to be a nice guy. I want to help people. I want to be friends with them. I DON'T want to spend every second of my life being superior, or a 'leader,' or the most aggressive caveman. I sure as hell don't want to treat women like objects. 

I've spent a fair bit of time here trying to reconcile the two philosophies, without much success. If I remain celibate for life and not a repulsive douchebag, so be it.  




 After the open-ended question, ask more questions to uncover specific details. Then share something related about yourself/your viewpoint on the subject. Rinse and repeat. 

E.g: what did you do this weekend? I went skiing.
- I didn't know you like skiing. How long have you been doing that for?
- was it fun? Any exciting stories? (moderate effectiveness depending on what you're actually asking about)
-  where did you go? What was it like there?
- is skiing hard?

Then:

- the last time I went skiing, I nearly got eaten by a carp. Crazy, right?
- I've heard a lot about skiing but never tried it. What about it is so fun? (great question if the person is really passionate about the given topic)
- my wife loves skiing. You should go together sometime.
- have you tried (skiing place)?

These all vary according to your level of knowledge of the subject, but a good rule of thumb is that if you don't know what they're talking about, encourage them to explain and teach you. If you do, share expertise/viewpoints/stories etc. Learn further. Note that it is **very** important not to talk too much about your own perspectives, especially when talking about something like politics.  




 This is about as erotic as the American Idol auditions.

Which brings me nicely to **VIII**: Thou shalt critique the spelling of others in a 19th Century German Facist manner 




 Does she ignore you or not talk to you? The difference is very important. 

If you're trying to talk to her and she is being noncommittal, one word answers, trying to get away etc - ignoring you - then she is clearly not into you at all, and asking her out will only lead to great embarrassment. 

If she just doesn't come up and talk to you because you're not that good friends, or because she has higher priorities (other friends that you mentioned) then there's nothing wrong. She just doesn't know you well enough to have a reason to talk to you. While a lot of people are advocating to straight up ask her out, and this attitude is definitely what you need, I'd still advise testing the waters a little bit - find some reason to make conversation with her and see how she reacts (ask her to help you with some schoolwork etc). If she responds in a friendly manner - and not in the way I described in the first paragraph - all signals go. Balls to the wind, ask her out, and hopefully she says yes. 

If she politely turns you down, don't be offended. You're not right for each other and she knows it. The same applies for if she is properly ignoring you as above. If she rejects you nastily, then she's a Class A bitch that you definitely don't want to be with, and you've just dodged a bullet. 

Good luck!
