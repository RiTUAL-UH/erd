 Not that what he said was right or factually accurate but I don't understand how people think he thinks all Mexicans are bad people. Or even most. He just thinks there is a huge border problem and a lot of the illegals are dangerous. He might be wrong. But that doesn't mean he is racist. I think a lot of people are being unfair and not even trying to understand him. I am willing to say he is your typical narrow minded republican.
