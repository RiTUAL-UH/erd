 I agree that it's not a big deal (I see it as I would any other drug such as marijuana). But it's not a good idea for law enforcement to break the law and enforce the same law. 




 I... don't think that's likely. 




 This seems... random. 300 people for the man who almost became President? 









 I'm curious then why my experience was dismissed as anectodal while the one I responded to wasn't.

Criticism is fine, but only if it is fair. When it isn't fair, it is "bashing". 




 Good point. 




 I think growth is more terrifying. 




 The "new" path? That is how the free market operates without proper oversight. 




 Well, I notice you didn't make the same comment to the anecdote I was replying to. As a proud LGBT Southern activist (on one local board and one statewide board), South-bashing is tired and not very productive. Minimizing my experience but not that of the commenter to whom I replied is a good example of how subtle it can be.

As for relevance, I responded to an anecdote with a counter-anecdote. 




 I live in GA (notably _not_ Atlanta) and have never felt threatened because I'm gay. 




 I will do a happy fuck you dance when I return my Comcast equipment. 




 Wait what does this mean at the end?

 If (name redacted) would like us to post the rest of the conversation, he cannot bring $15to the Metro Spirit office today by 3:00. 




 The planet is not your private domain. 




 I think "consumers" is the best response so far (and what your suggestion - potential Tesla owners - seems to imply). But I don't think Democrats champion "consumers" as prominently as Republicans champion "the free market". 









 Demographics happened to Regency... 




 Wait - what does gun ownership have to do with Tesla not being able to sell directly? 




 That was a statement made by _his_ attorney, not any prosecutor. I agree with your general point though. 




 Even assuming that's true, is that relevant here? Who's the little man that the Democrats aren't supporting? 




 To be fair though, Republicans carry the free-market-above-all-else banner proudly and loudly, and more so than Democrats. 









 It's the other way around, my friend. 




 The Right to Personal Dignity/Privacy 









 Cynicism is not wisdom. 




 Of course I'm referring to race. You must live in that conservative fantasy colorblind world, despite all evidence to the contrary.

Do you not recognize the racial problem in our justice/political system? Because acceptance of that fact is Step 1 in this discussion.

As for your last point... did you hear about the rioting and looting at the Pumpkin Festival up north, and all the hooligans who were arrested, and shot and killed? 




 One of the major problems with the whole Ferguson situation is that the elected officials don't reflect the community.

So, yes, vote. Use the ballot box and elect your leaders.

This strikes me as FOXNews playing the race card race card. If you don't think there is an issue with race in this country (particularly between law enforcement and African-Americans) you just aren't fucking paying attention. 




 It just seems like a non-issue to me. I don't see it as being a good or a bad/cringy thing. 




 Actual gay uncle with no kids checking in. It may well be more of an individual proclivity and not a in-born thing but I do have a very strong desire to support by brother's and sister's children in any way possible.

Whether I have kids myself is still an open question. But until I do, I try to divert my resources their way as much as possible.

I suggest it may be an individual thing because I love both my siblings. Were there bad blood, the desire to help their children may not be there. 




 Never been to Atlanta, I see. Homo-mecca. 




 If by "pretty large" you mean "one of the largest in the U.S.", yes. 




 Broadly, yes. But the Constitution was a refinement of the Articles of Confederation. And the Commerce Clause was specifically intended to help improve upon the Articles by giving the federal government more authority.

The Commerce Clause was designed to make the federal government more powerful. You and others not understanding that doesn't make it any less so. 




 If I come in during posted business hours and get turned away or am given a shitty attitude, I just don't ever return.

Simple as that. 




 Why is it noteworthy she liked her own status? 




 Um, no. Way to let hyperbole completely take attention away from any validity your point may have.

The Commerce Clause + the Necessary and Proper Clause do vest the federal government with broad authority, but not absolute authority.

The intent was to give the national government a level of authority over the national economy. Naturally, if the national economy grows, so will that authority. 




 I've met those who _claim_ to care more about corporate welfare (such as yourself). But actions speak much louder on this point.

And why can't a liberal complain about vitriol? Not a single person encompasses the boogey-liberal-man you're apparently terrified of. Also, I didn't excuse Holder of anything.

You seriously have issues, my friend. 




 The national economy is _much_ more interconnected than it was at the Founding. I personally think the clause is currently interpreted correctly. 




 I think it's the other way around. The ANGC probably wouldn't notice if the hotel isn't open by April, but the Partridge Inn definitely would. 




 How _you_ doin'? 




 Voter turnout. 




 What in the world are you talking about? 




 Serious class hatred going on with you... 




 Yup. If I ever meet a libertarian who is more concerned about corporate welfare than human welfare, I might actually listen to what they're saying.

Until then, it's disingenuous and a cover for selfish greed. 




 Noble attempt but there's some intense astroturfing taking place in these comments. 




 That this vitriolic personal attack has positive upvotes tells me everything I need to know about this thread.

Good grief, people. 




 The renderings for the rooms show a dramatic improvement from their current state.

This is a great development! 














 Try asking the folks at the clubhou.se. 




 Try Auben Realty. 




 ~$18!

I use it for movies and in-app purchases. 




 Never made sense given contacts.google.com. 




 For the love of God don't give the reigns to the GOP. They seem to be too often blinded by budgetary hubris. 




 Jokers usually work outside the normal rules so it works well, I think. 




 It's ridiculous to claim employers and employees have equal leverage when negotiating, particularly with high unemployment.

A UBI would even that out that a good bit though. 




 I don't see this as necessarily hypocritical. If any one business in a market voluntarily raises it, that business is at a competitive disadvantage. The minimum wage levels the playing field.

A big element of the value of having a minimum wage is that it is required of _all_ businesses (particularly competitors). 




 Wet wipes. Dry is for cavemen. 




 Well, considering you have no idea who I am or what I do, the same insult seems to apply to you. 




  Ultracrepidarian

Is this an insult or what? 




 I think it's a diplomatic tactic to take advantage of inevitable sensationalism. 




 We're not talking ethics, we're talking accounting. Math is math - there's no "agreeing to disagree".

You might view it differently politically, but a tax deduction still costs the government money (just as if they were to eliminate the student loan interest deduction and send you an equivalent check every year). 




 Yes, I have. Quit being a condescending prick.

To bring up an example you used elsewhere in this thread...

There is zero practical difference between the government telling me to keep $20 more of my income and the government taxing me as usual but sending me $20. It reduces the amount of money in the government coffers exactly the same (and increase my money exactly the same).

Whatever amount of money you got to keep because you took the student loan interest deduction can just as easily be viewed as a check from the government. 




 A deduction based on student loans is giving me something I wouldn't have had otherwise, not allowing me to keep something I already have. It's essentially the government taking taxes from other people and using it to offset my liability.

Edit: And how many people does it take to remind you to vote? 




 Yes, they are "welfare". What else would it be? Magic free money? 




 Wait don't we subsidize the crap out of oil and coal? 




 Mot's is dog food.

Blasphemy 




 It's a very small segment of the community that votes. You have to buy a magazine (or have a subscription) because the ballot is inside an issue. Basically the Hill and no one else.

Easily manipulated, particularly in quiet categories. 




 "It says maybe more!" [walks in] "oh. not more." 




 The value is having the Google Voice number, not the block feature.

Post the Google Voice number to the public and set it up to ring your cell number. 




  I'd be surprised if Ebola ever makes it to America, honestly.

? 




 The panel opinion suggests that obtaining a photo ID to vote cant be a big deal, because one needs a photo ID to fly. Thats a common misconception. See Transportation Security Administration, _Acceptable IDs_, www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/acceptable-ids. Since, despite the 9/11 attacks that killed thousands, a photo ID is not considered essential to airline safety, it seems beyond odd that it should be considered essential to electoral validity. 




 _Read_ the goddamn opinion. Judge Posner addresses all these arguments. (Spoiler: Photo ID is _not_ always necessary to purchase a gun.) 




 I counted up to the level all four had in common (11), multiplied by 4, and then added the 3 loners.
 




 The thing is... when you start thinking this, you've already started believing it. Because everyone younger than me is stupid. 




 So the top comment in a thread asking what websites don't show up on Google... is a website that is literally Google? 














 If this is the same thing that was recently reported, they would hold the person down and stick fingers in his butthole and then into his own mouth. 




 How many white people don't have a birth certificate? Many elderly black people don't because it wasn't common during segregation. 




 The reward is nonexistent so the risk is still higher. Unless it's a coordinated effort, it just doesn't make sense to do.

And I've never seen any evidence of individuals doing it in any meaningful numbers, and not even one bit of evidence that it happens in a coordinated fashion. 




 And chemically castrated by the UK government for being homosexual, despite being instrumental in defeating the Nazis.

He was recently pardoned posthumously. His homosexuality and persecution should always be remembered. 




 This tactic is such crap. _You_ are implying minorities are not _smart_ enough or whatever to get ID. No one else is. The issue is how difficult it is (e.g., driving long distances, taking off work). 




 What's the incentive? Eligible voters already bitch that their vote is meaningless. Why would someone risk serious jail time for one additional meaningless vote?

It doesn't make sense. It's all about preventing Democratic-leaning voters from voting. 




 It is... but that's why most individual rights are protected by the federal government. Those 3 appellate judges don't give a shit what happens in Columbia.

Great info, too! 




 Minor bump in the road. The highest court that will hear the federal case (the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals) struck down Virginia's ban.

SC officials are simply wasting time and money. It's very disingenuous for anyone with knowledge of the legal system to throw up their hands and say, "But who knows how this case will be decided".

We know exactly how it'll be decided, because the highest court that will hear the case already did. 




 Hmm. We should get a lemur. 




 Based on your logic, he could have married his sister prior to today. What exactly is the point of this statement? 




 Unexpected but good. Voter ID laws at best are a solution looking for a problem. At worst, well, politics. 




 Two muscle bears fucking is pretty manly. 




 To you. Simply because you don't understand the problem doesn't mean the problem doesn't exist. 




 Charleston and Columbia are now issuing same-sex marriage licenses!

Any N. Augusta or Aiken couples planning on heading to Columbia? 









 Anyone who listens to music without headphones is King Douchebag of Everygym. 




 I would love to see this group grow and really help develop Augusta's tech industry, particularly with the introduction of the Cyber Command. 









 The statement from the representative does not indicate they sent it via regular mail as well. 




 As this decision* will lead to the invalidation of South Carolina's same-sex marriage ban, I think posting this in /r/Augusta is appropriate.

*Changed "ruling" to "decision", after 4 net upvotes. 



















 Yes. 




 Probably. Best practice is to send an important document via certified mail and regular mail. 




 I'm a lawyer and own my practice. I will hire more employees when my caseload increases (i.e., when there is more demand).

Cut my taxes and I'll just have more money. 




 Carolina Ale House? Although if you don't like Buffalo Wild Wing, I don't imagine you'd like it.

Somewhere in Augusta is local. 









 The drawing style is incredible. 




 I just point out that there are two religion clauses in the 1st Amendment: the Free Exercise Clause (the "of") and the Establishment Clause (the "from"). 




 At some point in the past I read in what I remember to have considered a reputable source that the "greying" of Presidents has a lot to do with the age window men are most likely to be in when they assume that office. 




 The weirdest part is I don't think many people thought this would happen again so quickly. I'm 32. I very clearly remember 2003.

I guess I thought the memory loss was a generational thing. Nope. Much quicker. 




 Yeah my first time was not, um, porn-worthy. 




 Even in death, he leaves his mark. 




 That seems to me how it boils down. 




 I think it may be dodgy wording. Currently, the property is tax exempt and I think the question is whether that should continue if operated by private companies.

Never trust how a ballot measure is worded. 




 Oops - thanks for that. Autocorrect strikes again. It should be "continue". 




 hell, just look at the comments section on any political article on Augusta Chronicle!

Ain't that the truth (this article included). 




 The ballot language is as follows:

Shall property owned by the University System of Georgia and utilized by providers of college and university student housing and other facilities continue to be exempt from taxation to keep costs affordable?

I am extremely skeptical of the privatization trend and was shocked to learn that this seemingly innocuous proposal was part of a larger dorm-privatization plan.

I'm voting "No". 









 Very difficult because it is hard to rebut someone saying they forgot or were mistaken.  




 Well, no pressure or anything, right? 




 I completely understand that. But the issue is whether China's cooperation with South Africa is so essential that the decision to cancel the event can justifiably be characterized as a decision in name only ("You can't really blame the SA government.") 




 Right, that's it's a pressure. But it's not a live or die pressure, which would certainly take precedence. (I read your post as implying that it was live or die.)
