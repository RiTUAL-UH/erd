 Eh, must be one of the those DIY escalators... 




 Sorry, I don't give a damn...

 I found it hard to differentiate between a good pun and a bad one. 




 "Studying literature is a really big waste of time."

Apparently the website wants me to just calm down a bit and stop ranting about humanities... 




 There are currently 911 downvotes on this post...COINCIDENCE?!?
