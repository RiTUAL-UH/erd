 I known exactly what you mean, I recently gained 40 pounds and cried while getting dressed for Christmas today. I missed thanksgiving because I was so embarrassed  my weight gain. Today I felt defeated and sorry for myself but eventually I found something I felt mildly comfortable wearing and promised myself I would do whatever it took to make sure I didn't feel this way next christmas. 
Just make the choice to make 2015 different. You've lost the weight before, you can do it again, you just have to Crack down and commit to it.  




 Thank you so much for the advice. I used to track my food, like 2 years ago, and it worked wonders. I don't know why I never tried it again, but you're absolutely right. I'm just guessing at my diet, assuming I'm making the right choices, but I'm probably not. I'm going to download MFP tonight and start fresh in the morning. Thank you again!  




 Wow that makes so much sense I wonder how the thought never occurred to me before! Thank you VERY much for that insight, I'll look into that avenue more. 




 Actually I've been considering switching switching for some time now. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety  (used to be VERY prone to anxiety attacks) at 16 (11 years ago) and first tried Paxil. That made me so much worse. My self harming increased and I became more suicidal. My doc at the time took me off of that and put me on Lexapro. It worked well enough, and I've been too scared to try anything else because of my experience with Paxil. But I'm thinking more and more it's time to try something new. There are so many signs that say this just isn't the right thing for me. 




 Im a 27 year old female, 5'2". March of this year I was 185lbs. I joined a boxing club and was instantly obsessed. I was doing great going 3-5 days a week and I actually gained a couple of pounds because of muscle but I dropped a dress size and I was in GREAT shape, but more importantly I felt great about myself. 
I started this gym to try to help my depression in an un-medicated fashion but it didn't help, so in June I got back on Lexapro. Since then I've gone from 187 to 215. I've been at 215 for about 2 months now. I know the medicine is the main cause for the weight gain but I'll admit I'm having trouble getting into the gym for months now. Injuries, illness, I  didn't have a car for a full month, and my job kept me away so I got into the habit of just not going. Right now I go about once a week. I want so badly to go more but this is my busiest time of year at work and I just can't get the time in. 

I don't know if I'm writing this for support, advice, or to just get it off of my chest. I'm just so damn frustrated it's moving me to tears. I don't recognize myself in the mirror anymore. NONE of my clothes fit. None. I'm at the highest weight I've ever been in my life and I have so much work to do to get back to where I started this year it feels impossible. 




 I was at an indoor range shooting my Sig p226 and a spent shell bounced off the side of my lane and straight down my shirt. That's the day I learned ladies  shouldn't wear V-neck shirts while shooting. 




 Fuck. That.
Have you ever had a hot, freshly  spent shell fly down your shirt and land on your breasts? I have. Still have the scar after 5 years. 




 This might be a little long, but here goes...

My husband and I lived next door to an elderly couple, the wife was sick and dying and the husband was an alcoholic/drug addict/drug dealer. He would use and deal his dying wife's meds in his driveway or right in the street. We should have known there was going to be problems because he told us he's glad "a nice white couple moved in" because he's tired of "living next to worthless niggers."
One night soon after we moved in, he was banging on our door at 3 am saying someone was trying to break into his house. My husband went over there with a gun and made sure the place was clear but the old man kept him there till 5 am. This happened 2 more times before my husband just said "it's not my problem, call the cops".

Here's the worst night; my husband called at 1 am to say he was almost home from the rig. Shortly after, I heard banging on the door. Thinking it was my husband and he forgot his keys I opened the door without checking. It was the old man, high as hell and  holding a machettee, saying he saw someone in my yard trying to break into the other side of my house. I grab the Sig Sauer, call 911, and go search the yard, finding nothing. Cops get there, arrest him because it's the 5th similar incident of the day. He's sent to a mental hospital and his poor sick wife is left alone and evicted. 




 Inception and The Dark Knight. 
Fantastic soundtracks.  




 I relate so much to the second dog so much it hurts 




 My best friend in high school was horrified of butterflies. I always thought she was full of shit, till one day in the park one flew near her and she dropped to the ground screaming and crying. Took forever to calm her down. 




 My college roommate (also my best friend since 3rd grade) brought home a girl he met in math class. She and I became fast friends (im a girl). They fell in love and we became the 3 muksateers. He committed suicide a few months later. She and I survived because we had each other. Still best friends 7 years later. 




 The most beautiful game I've ever played and you captured it well! Great work! 




 Me too! It was amazing. He's amazing!.

If I had gold to give, it would be yours. I love puns. 




 My husband and I were at a friend's destination wedding in the mountains a few years ago, and we got into an argument after the rehearsal dinner. Seeing as I was the maid of honor with a wedding to control the next day,  and it was like 1 am, I left him outside to smoke a cigar and went to bed. Next thing I know at 3 am and he's in my ear telling me to look up. I roll over, the room is pitch black save for the dozens of fireflies. He knew I'd never seen them before,  so he spent 2 hours in the dark catching them by hand, then released them in our room at the cabin. 

Next to our wedding, that was the best night of my life.
