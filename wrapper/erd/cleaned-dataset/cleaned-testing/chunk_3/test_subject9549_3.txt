 The Walking Dead - Still (Season 4, Episode 12). 

Absolutely nothing happened - basically an hour of bullshit character development. Most of the episode revolves around Beth wanting alcohol. She's willing to risk her life, and Daryl's too, for her first fucking taste of alcohol. God damn it, Beth, you're in the zombie apocalypse, not a sorority.  




 Stay classy, Newport.

 Ass to ass! 




 I've had my car for 5 years and I'm only about to hit 40,000 miles. At this rate, I can't be immature for another 5 more years. Am I doing driving wrong? :( 




 Have you talked to your professor at all?

My husband was in the same position as you last semester. He was all set to graduate, but he could not for the life of him pass any of his tests in his language course. He had to get a decent grade on his final just to pass - he was averaging 50s on the tests and he needed close to a 75 or something on the final. In the final weeks, he asked his professor for help as much as possible, tried to show he cared about the class and was really trying but just couldn't grasp the content. He also told her that he needed to pass this course to graduate and that he had a job lined up after graduation, which obviously he would lose if he didn't graduate. He studied hard for the final, but he was confident that he failed. However, two days before graduation his professor emailed him and said he had just barely passed the class and he was graduating. I have no clue what he actually scored on his final, but he likes to think that talking to his professor is what helped. She actually was willing to work with him - she offered extra credit and was willing to drop his lowest test grade to see if it would help. 

So, if you haven't talked to your professor, I would highly recommend it. Seek all the help you can get. Best of luck.  




 I am in the same boat. I sometimes feel extremely nauseous in the mornings. I also have terrible stomach pains. The main thing that helps is having a bowel movement and my doctor prescribed Zofran for the nausea. If I don't have a BM or don't take the medicine, the pain and nausea just go away after being awake for a couple hours. 

I would definitely try exercise to see if it helps. I tend to feel better when I'm standing up and moving around.  




 We did this as well. For sex we came up with "taking the beef bus to tuna town." 




 This. Exactly this.

I don't understand why you want/need your parents' permission to return home. You're an adult now, you are free to make your own choices. If you feel so strongly about returning to your hometown, support yourself. Get your own place. If you can't afford to do this own your own, find roommates to help split the cost of rent.

 I'm from Northern Kentucky and can confirm there are tons of people with that last name. 

Edit: Wording.

 In the show, there was no mention of Tysha (Tyrion's first wife) during the climactic events which led to Tyrion killing Shae and Tywin. In the book, Jaime reveals the truth about Tysha which absolutely enrages Tyrion and fuels him to find Tywin, ultimately resulting in the two deaths. I am so disappointed the show didn't follow the book. 




 I was having a wonderful day. This just ruined everything. I am so devastated. My husband and I adore him. What Dreams May Come is one of our favorite movies - this solidifies that I'll sob through that movie every single time I watch it in the future. Time to watch all his movies and cry! 




 My grandmother would spend hours preparing Thanksgiving dinner every year. One year, my grandpa kept joking that HE stayed up all night slaving over the stove, which obviously made Grandma very angry. My grandma was a serious and religious women who very rarely cussed, but she turned to my grandpa that Thanksgiving and said, "Ronald, that must be your ass talking because your mouth knows better." It was so unexpected. My grandpa was absolutely dumbfounded.
