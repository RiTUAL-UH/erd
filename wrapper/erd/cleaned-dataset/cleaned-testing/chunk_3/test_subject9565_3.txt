 Pitch Perfect and Frozen are currently my favourite musical movies. But my favourite musical I've seen live in Wicked, I hope one day they make a movie version with the original broadway actors/actresses 




 No surprise there  




 Seriously? Out of all the movies to pick from a woman got jail sentence for overdue VHS rental of ''Monster in Law'' LOL girl you could of done way better.  




 Poker House
Not many people know about the film, but it's one of Jennifer Lawrence first films she ever done, Chole Grace Moretz and Selma Blair are in the film as well.

The scene that broke me was when Agnes (Jennifer) confronted her mom and the pimp. It was so sad because she has a gun in her hand and she's trying to get her mom to listen but she won't. Also if you watch the movie, you feel sympathy for Agnes character because she has to take over the parent role even though she's still in high school because her mom has drugs and alcohol problems. Another sad thing about the whole movie in general, is that this story is based on the director childhood life which is really upsetting because a few scenes were heartbreaking to watch. 




 Ryan Gosling- Crazy Stupid Love 




 Unnecessary sequel   




 I feel like whoever did the casting, focused more on casting big name actors/actresses than casting less big name actors/actresses who probably are more believable.  




 My bad, I was too lazy to write the whole thing. Sliver Linings Playbook. Garden State was a really good movie.  




 Iron Man 3 




 The Butler. I'm sorry the way how Oprah character died, was poorly done and ruined the movie for me.  




 I just saw it recently, reminds me of SLP. Even though GS was released before. 




 1channel and solarmovie good sites to use 




 Sliver Linings Playbook, Away From Her  




 But Lawrence still nailed it though. I wonder if Anne would of stayed if she would of been nominated twice  




 I suggest Poker House  




 AH was overrated  




 I don't know about the other years, but last year it happened. Jennifer did not win the BAFTA, but she won the Oscar.  




 I'll be honest, I'm a big Jennifer Lawrence fan. I have seen every film she has been in. I thought she deserved the BAFTA last year in Sliver Linings Playbook then this year. Good performance in AH, but her SLP was way better. I hope Lupita wins.  




 Netflix  




 Too many good movies released on Christmas Day!  




 Way Way Back, Her  




 Pitch Perfect  




 Does TV Movies count? 
The Perfect Boyfriend
The Boy She Met Online  




 Frozen, I know it's Disney but I'm telling you it's amazing plus Let it Go will be stuck in your head for the rest of your life. Not your typical disney movie. 

Way Way Back- Great cast- Steve from The Office, Toni Colliete, Liam James etc. Has a mix of comedy, drama and romance. Movie from a 14 year old perspective. 

Catching Fire- Dark intense compared to the first movie. Lots of character development and more entertaining.  




 Having a relationship or not doesn't mean you won't be able to enjoy the movie to the full extent because you haven't been in a relationship before. Spectacular Now I heard a lot of great things about it, if you like a coming of age romance then sure I would recommend seeing it.  




 FROZEN  




 The Way Way Back (2013) indie film. I was feeling like shit, but I left the theatre with a smile on my face.  




 No more drugs 




 Life sucks., but it is up to us to determine what we want to do. I know what it's like to wake up every morning and having nothing to look forward to. I know the feeling of how if I end my life it will all go away. But then I look around, I see my friends, my family and my dad. My dad has cancer for almost four years. Every single day, he wakes up with a smile on his face. No matter how much pain he is in he always hides it and jokes about his cancer. Why am I telling my life to you? Because I know what you are feeling and it sucks trust me. But, there is so much ahead you don't even know it. The thing is if we kill ourselves voluntary, that means we lose. And it's not about win or lose, but it's about giving up. Life has it ups and downs and there will be plenty of downs, but if you give up you will miss on so many moments. It's not worth it, trust me.  




 Thank you for responding. I keep on delaying going to the doctor, but I think I need to go because I want to know if this because of the news or this is a long term thing. Because if there is like a light switch that would be great because I would like to be my old self again 




 You should try to find a way to control your anger and find a output where no one will get hurt.  




 So I have been thinking about death a lot and have been since November when my dads cancer has spread. I don't know I guess when I heard the news it just crushed me. Now, people who know me think I'm this happy go lucky girl who likes to make others laugh and always smiling. The problem is that's not really me. I only do that because it helps me forget my problems. I have no one to talk to because it's rare to find another 20 year old who's parent has cancer as well. I'm not close with my sisters. My sister got engaged like a week after the cancer news and I still try to be happy for her, but I'm not. Does that make me a bad person, that I would rather watch a movie or a tv show then to dress up and go to a wedding? I mean everything seems gray now, I'm very talkative at school but when I get home I stay in my room and go on the internet  for hours. I only talk to people usually if they message me first. I have no one to talk to, I have friends but I'm a secretive person. I also am 99.9% have anxiety. I'm always worried, when it comes to driving- I did not drive at all last winter and driving a new car. When it comes to school and just every day things. So I'm getting this off my chest- if someone was to give me something that would allow me to die, honestly I would take it. I'm just not happy.   




 I do it! For fun, I want to post my script and ideas somewhere but the problem is I don't have in the script format  




 I know Pitch Perfect is getting a sequel but the plot has not been released yet. My idea for Pitch Perfect 2 is having Becca and Fat Amy lead Barden Bellas and there is tension between Jesse and Beca because they are aganist each other.  




 Just be yourself, it looks like you knew what you were doing. Give him your number 




 Hi Matt Damon, 
Is there one movie genre that you haven't done in a while that you would like to do again?

Also if you respond to this, I can say Matt Damon Fucking Responded to Me  




 My grades are good, I get A's and B's but that is all going to change because of my teacher. I'm hard of hearing and been struggling in his class. He is old school and writes barely anything on the board. All he does is just talks which is very hard for me to listen and then have to take notes at the same time. So I raised my hand in the second class asking him to repeat something and he said he already repeated it and if I stop raising my hand I would of listen. He is so rude and he thinks the class is so dumb saying oh its so easy. Also yesterday he was ''trying'' to help a student out with a formula and he said something that he says to his dog and he told the class that. I had my complains of teachers, but not to the point where he will not help, he is so rude and he won't even put anything on the board even if you ask. I don't understand how he got hired.  




 Books are most of the time better the film because of many reasons. There are many times that the actors are miscast and do not represent the characteristics that were mentioned in the book. Also, the movie can only be so long and do not add a few plots from the book due to time which sometimes is disappointing because we look forward to a part of the book and it is not included into the film. The only movies that I watched that were almost good as the book was Catching Fire and the Help. It is really hard for the director and the film crew to make a movie better or just as good as the book.
