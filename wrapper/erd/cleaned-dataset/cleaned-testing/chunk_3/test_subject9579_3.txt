 Do evolution materials need to be max level to use?

Specifically, does Turbo Hydraloid need to be level 80 to evolve Tridon to 6*? 




 Thanks!

I'll let you know.  




 Hi,

I sent you a request.  I run Zelnite almost always and I need your Lilly for taking on Maxwell.

 - **IGN+ID:**  Jaird 8199519575

- **Account Level:**  130
   
- **Leaders:**  Zelnite, Ultor (for arena)
   
- **Looking for:**  Tyrant Lillly Matah friends for Maxwell runs
   
- **Active:**  Daily 




 I'm trying to put together a squad for Maxwell:

I have Zelnite and Darvanshel fully maxed and sphere frogged 

I also have a maxed Tree and Grah

I'm planning on taking a Lilly Matah friend (after I find one, looking for friend thread, I know)

For my last spot I was thinking of training up the Rowgen I just pulled, will he work or should I be looking for someone else?

Also, what kind of spheres should I be using?  I have all the GGC ones (except Black Lance), one Medulla, 2 Sol Creators, Evil Shard, Providence Ring, and the Halloween Spheres (both).  

I couldn't make the score for a Legwand last FH. 




 'Ryan? Yeah, he's a pretty chill roommate; only makes me wear pants when his parents are visiting.' 




 I have one. I doubt it'll happen again.  




 Thanks.  I was leaning more towards him anyway.  




 Who would benefit me more for FH?  6* Hogar or 6* Zellha?

I can evolve one this week.

 I caught Goltovah. 

I read somewhere that all mid-bosses are capturable. 

Today in Lucana's I ran into a Burst Frog and Thunder Crystal mid-boss. Of course I caught the crystal.  




 Accepted. Happy Hunting! 




 Awesome!!
