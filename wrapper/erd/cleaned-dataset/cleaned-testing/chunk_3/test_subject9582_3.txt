 Correct. It was less than a week before Sirius went to Azkaban after the death of the Potters.
 




 GoF is still on HBO, but it's probably the worst film, so who cares? 




 Ayup.  




 Yea. I went through the same thing. My parents adopted my mom's brother's daughter.

(I'll throw in former roommate for the joke) 




 Now that you mention it, he took a shower after every quidditch match.
 




 Yea, he only took one bath. Kinda gross. 




 If you buy the super expensive copies they have the deleted scenes on an extras disk, but ABC Fam just edits them all together.. most at least. 




 That's a good point. He would get new ones at the Dursleys. Not sure about the UK, but an adopted child gets assistance in the states. 




 Why is there no mention of Harry getting larger glasses as he ages? Certainly the glasses he had as a child would not fit him in his later years. 




 ABCFam also includes all  the deleted scenes. 




 You are right. But it just seemed tedious on my first read, I wanted to get into the action! But in my re-reads, it actually does fit in quite nicely. 




 You could start over, or join Pottermore. 




 Starts at 3:30 EDT today. 




 Gof or HBP.

Goblet was such a *whodunnit*, and Voldemort comes back, and Albus and Cornelius are on different planets at the end.

For HBP, it grabs you in the second chapter. I remember my wife and I reading it the release night thinking, "What the hell is Snape on about?" (we had always thought he was a good guy) Anyway we learned all about Riddle's past and the horcruxes, and then the ultimate act of bravery(?) happened, and there was nothing but speculation for the next 18 months. 




 I like you. I would tongue-punch your fart box all night. 

However, you seem a bit centered on the color of a person's skin. We all bleed the same color.

And... We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are. 









 No they didn't.
 




 He probably would have tried to kill Malfoy or at the very least completely discredit him.  




 It would have been interesting if She allowed Sirius to live until HBP, and he died because of one of Draco's failed attempts at Dumbledore. 




 Harry not using the damn mirror before rushing off to the ministry and an ambush. 




 You're on top of that story, aren't you. 




 I would think Sirius would teach the same things Harry taught the DA. Wasn't it Sirius and Lupin that gave Harry those defense books for Christmas in OotP? 




 It's common for only the first child in the states. 




 Four months is still a bit early for a baby shower though. They're usually done in the last trimester of pregnancy, but then I have no clue about English culture, 




 True. 




 Could be referring to Lily Luna. 




 A: One less drunk. 




 Once again, your essay does not disappoint. Bravo. 




 Perhaps she pricked him after his darkmark was fresh.
 









 My way home is my favorite also. Like /u/Best_Roommate says, My Lunch is a real tear jerker. 

I don't understand why so many like My Musical. I usually skip that one on the Netflix.

My Philosophy is a **GREAT** episode.

Edit: More would be: My Own American Girl, My Screw Up, and My Cake like everyone else.
 




 Probably Megadeth.
 




 I like it, but it looks like a cover-up with all the black. 




 I put mine between the cellophane and the pack. 




 Even worse is people who litter in state parks. (I'm American) These places are reserved for wildlife to grow abound, and people throw trash on the trails. When I hike, I pick up everything I see and put it in my pocket, even the butts. 




 Their grammar. You are the product of four billion years of evolution, act like it. 




  Firstly, the toilets aren't the only way in

They used the floo network also, but I will say that flushing yourself in was only implicated after Voldemort took over the ministry. 




 I'm 38, and I re-read at least once a year. I'm envious of you on your first read. 

Side note, I would stay far away from this sub until you are finished. 









 Darkmark goes on the left arm unless that's a mirror image. 




 The fifth house is Tigera. The founder was Taranus Tigera, the colors were orange and black, and she preferred her common room just outside the herbology department on the outskirts of the Forbidden Forest where she could be close to nature. 




 Yea, I think he sold them. Sorry. 




 I would imagine they could use the floo network within the castle. We saw it once when Snape wanted Lupin to look at the marauders map. 




 EDT* 




 It's mentioned plenty of times. Honestly, will you ever read *Hogwarts, a history?* 




 Well, Ginny did name Pigwidgeon. 









  She's not a doormat and she's not an angel.

No she wasn't. Lily was a fiery, strong headed ginger. That's where Harry got most of his bullheadedness from. Everyone thought Harry was so much like James, but I would propose that he was *most* like Lily wearing a James mask... except for the eyes of course. 




 YAY!
 




 Good enough for me, good night. 




 Professor Black did not hear everything they said. He only heard 'forest of Dean' whe Hermione opened her bag for the tent. When her beaded bag was closed, all he heard was the jumble of things. 




 I like that assessment, but I think the locket would have killed Harry. I don't think Snape would have been watching. 

Snape didn't know they had the locket, he was just trying to give them the sword.

Side note: How did Severus get it under a sheet of ice? 




 Half Blood Prince was my favorite, followed closely by Goblet of Fire.

We learned so much that tied the first five together in HBP, and GOF was the first one I read cover to cover in one sitting. My wife had read it first, and after I got to. Exciting after a werewolf runs the grounds.  




 I will. One of my friends in High School and I hung out simply because we had *Hem Hem,* connections. He was my age, and our mutual desire was two years younger.

From our junior year to our senior year, we fought over who was going to take her out. She broke up with him so I assumed she was free game our junior year. I took her out on dates for about three weeks, then we split amicably. 

Long story short, come our senior year we became good friends tying to cock block all of her new male interests. 

Not really *good friends,* but we hung out a lot more the last year.

Edit: We always had a discussion if the guy she was with was good enough for her. 




 That scene or the puff scene... 




 I've always liked this one. Reminds me of a time about 25 years ago in high school, when a frenemie of mine liked the same girl. 




 [This thing](http://i.imgur.com/yMVvcmq.jpg) 




 /u/chimpwizard but he's in Australia and asleep now.

You could always check out hpcompanion.com, that does a chapter by chapter analysis also. 




 Yep! 




 Watch *In Bruges* totally different character. 




 A little boy goes up to his father and asks: "Dad, what's the difference between hypothetical and reality?"
The father replies: "Well son, I could give you the book definitions, but I feel it could be best to show you by example. Go upstairs and ask your mother if she'd have sex with the mailman for $500,000."
The boy goes and asks his mother: "Mom, would you have sex with the mailman for $500,000?" The mother replies: "Hell yes I would!"
The little boy returns to his father: "Dad, she said 'Hell yes I would!'" The father then says: "Okay, now go and ask your older sister if she'd have sex with her principal for $500,000."
The boy asks his sister: "Would you have sex with your principal for $500,000?" The sister replies: "Hell yes I would!"
He returns to his father: "Dad, she said 'Hell yes I would!'" The father answers: "Okay son, here's the deal: Hypothetically, we're millionaires, but in reality, we're just living with a couple of whores." 




 Probably a 7-2 offsuit, and she was repping a full house.

In all seriousness, I don't like kool aid. I do drink a lot of gatorade.
 




 Tell me a bird story. Ever had one get loose in the store? 




 I like the placement. 









 Way to catch up! 




 Allowed* 




 Oh yea, she had some serious necrosis. They had to amputate most of her calf muscle. 




 My cousin was bit on the right calf by a brown recluse, and lost a lot of her muscle in the same fashion. 




 She said so in an interview like Cronos said, but it wasn't at Hogwarts, it was in Hagrid's hut. 




 Albus used HR to know that Ron and Harry were in Hagrid's hut under the cloak in CoS. 




 TIL..
 




 What does a thestral have to do with death? I understand that only those that have seen death can see thestrals, but it still makes no sense.
 




 So? 




 Sure there is. One of the Slytherins biggest traits is self preservation. While the Gryffs would run into a fight (bravery), if a Slytherin knew that the outcome wouldn't benefit them, they would run away. 




 I'll have a Bertie Bott's, three chocolate frogs, three pumpkin pasties, and two licorice wands please. 




 I got it. 




 How do I change it? 




 Why change my flair?
 




  (as believed by Dumbledore)

Isn't that enough?

 




 Ravenclaw

Whichever position

I would like to be on the team

I have played mod quidditch 




 Harry! Harry! Did you choke on your toothbrush? 




 All well and good, except Ignotus Peverell created the cloak, not death incarnate. 









 OOHHH! My bad. I had to wait for each book.
 




 I had never thought about that aspect of it. Kudos!

Not to rain on your parade, but the quote is, "..why on Earth should that mean it is not real?" 




 I am old enough to have read each book prior to its corresponding movie

There was only one book. 




 That gave me a seizure thank you very much. 




 I would add that Universal was totally going under, and that addition saved and revitalized the park.
 




 I have no idea about Discworld. Just what I have read about the Potterverse. 




 She more than likely summoned them from the kitchen.  




 In the book, the glass never re-appeared, Dudley just fell in the water. 




 It's explained as *obliviate* in the film, but in the book she didn't wipe their memories per se, she modified them to make them think they were Wendell and Monica Wilkins, who's life's dream was to move to Australia.

Just another time the films took liberties to try to move the plot for the audience. 




 I think he was referring to the clothes they had on before they took the polyjuice. They all didn't have an identical wardrobe like in the film, just clothes that would fit. 




 Me too. In Bruges is another great one he's in with Ralph Fiennes. 




 On the rare occasion that a male werewolf meets a female werewolf while they are both transformed, and they mate, the offspring will in fact just be highly intelligent wolves. 

There *are* some of those in the forest, so perhaps that's what Riddle was referring to? 




 Ahhh, my bad. 




 Don't forget Crouch Jr. was under the imperius curse a long time himself.
 




 They're on Youtube.
 




 Listen to me, Potter. Your pal Diggory? By your age he could turn a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour is as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust, but Karkaroff's is not. They'll have a strategy. And you can bet that it will play to Krum's strengths. Come on, Potter, what are you strengths? 

In short, they were all exceptionally powerful. 




 Book would be GoF and film would be HBP. 









 I live under a bridge thank you very much. 




 Bob had bitch tits. 




 You know they float... 




 The duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore in the ministry.
 




 Not sure, he never talked about it much, but his nails were always wonky.
 




 Not really, it was still a boggart.

I re-created the feelings a dementor gave Harry, but it could never have kissed him. 




 Viet Cong shoved bamboo shoots under my dad's nails.
 




 Very nice. 

One question, are you implying Severus and Lily went together or do you mean that one of them did it of their own volition? 




 That's cool, how does she like it so far?
 




 Yea, we have all read them, and they are well worn. Some are held together with duct tape, and there are dog ears and underlines and notes.  




 She will more than likely be a Gryffindor. I see the traits in her already. 




 But of course. If there was ever a truer Slytherin in the series, it would be Lucius Malfoy. 




 But of course it's my fellow potterheads on Reddit. I have learned more from you lot, than I ever did in my 20+ rereads. 




 Someone preparing a Brazilian wax. 




 I ordered a pizza the other day, and when the girl was reading me back my order she says, "So you have one large, thick, sausage, anything else?"
I looked her dead in the eye and said, "Yes, I also ordered a pizza."
