Seriously. 




 I loved Tyrone!  In "Elway's Greatest Comebacks", a Steve Sabol film that we had on VHS when I was little, Braxton is featured heavily commenting on the *other* game-winning drive that started on the 2 yard line:

[The Drive II] (http://youtu.be/03pqRihRbMA?t=18m20s)

 Fuck you Seahawk!

In all seriousness, it was my very favorite too.  Boomer and TJ, with that iconic music that they would get into:  Duh-duhduh-duuuuuhduhduh-duh-duhduh.  Duh-duh-duhduhduhduhduh-duhduhduhduhduhduh (duh duh duh!)  and so on . . .

We had season tickets through the end of my elementary years into high school, and sometimes I was legitimately disappointed we didn't make it back home in time to see the highlights from a game we just won . . . Maybe even against division rival Seattle (I was at the game where TD got to 2000 against you! )

Just a reality in a non Internet world, I guess. 




 That was fucking awesome.

Prime time.  Prime time.  Prime time. 




 Let the man dance for his fucking record ya cunts, jeez. 




 Yay a first down!

Oh, he fumbled.  




 I KNOW I NEED TO BE LESS LAZY. 




 Good point.

Go fuck yourself. 




 Personal Foul, Taunting, Offense, #87.

100%.  Isn't that so stupid? 




 that was hard.  you could get some kind of flukey magic, a turnover-fest, or lose 9-3 to the chiefs at home.

 




 I like "felipe rios"!

I do "Joe Table" and "Pete Waiter" all the time, but never from english to non-english. 




 i give extra points for the subtle call-back to the original ("run away from the D"). 




 Remember that time when your star receiver said that the solution was to throw him more balls?  And then next week they did and he dropped them all*?

Or how about the time where your running back slipped and hitting the ground caused him to fumble?   The ground.  I mean, it's right there - not moving at all.  maybe protect the rock a little when you're falling down like an asshole.

*hyperbole 




 No chance.  Manning can't win in the cold. 




 Definitely not MLA or Chicago guidelines.
 




 even bronco fans know that a fear of blucifer is healthy and justified. 




 Poncho:  Billy!  You know something.

BIlly:  I'm scared, Poncho.

Poncho:  Bullshit!  You ain't afraid of no man.

Billy:  There's something out there hunting us.  And it ain't no man.



 




 this is going to be like that movie where the creature they made escapes and causes problems. 




 Just shadows on the cave, friend.

Shadows on the cave.

And our horse shadows shall prevail against the bird shadows! 




 They totally should've just cast, "He Hate Me" in that role.  I mean who gives a shit? 




 I think filmmakers get tax credits or something for shooting there.  so, maybe those hollywood types would be a little miffed before just going to Shreveport. 




 okay, you're right.  The steelers were the first team to ever popularize waving around a towel.

Happy now? 




 I mean, they only played 14 games back then.  I bet Goodell would kept the ratio the same (1/8th).

So it's 1.75 games for killing your wife.  He could play in the 4th quarter of game 2, with fresh legs while the defense was all tired out.  Seems fair. 




 richard sherman downvotes comments saying he isn't elite because he disagrees with them, not because they don't add anything to the discussion. 




 hey, seattle!  our game is going to be blown out of proportion, over-analyzed, and made out to determine the best team in the league . . . in week 3.

then we have to let it sink in over a bye week.

yay 




 Let's just hope it isn't like *rocky balboa*:  unnecessary and forgettable. 




 yeah, but that was for another crime, dick! 




 For what it is worth, Vegas has the line at Seahawks (-4.5), and it is getting a lot of action.  In fact, the Broncos (+4.5) is one of the best bets this week, offering only -105.

I think that's interesting.  I would probably take the points. 




 I mean, the Colts went 4/13 on third downs in week 1, so I wouldn't be super concerned about it.  It could just be a small sample size and a bit of a statistical anomaly.  Teams will not usually convert so many 3rd and longs, just on average.

That being said, 3rd down is what makes a good defense great - and the Broncos need to focus on and improve that aspect of their game. 




 Well, Seattle is definitely going to rush the right side of the O-line to go at Clark.  It will be noisy, and he got wrecked in the SB.  So, if he improves at all against the Seahawks, I will count it as a win.  If he doesn't, Peyton may die. 




 At the tackles, specifically.  Up the middle it looks okay. 




 Nah, that's an absurd position to hold.  You don't lose by 35 by "Not showing up".  You probably don't lose by 35 by being outplayed, either.  You lose by 35 by getting outplayed AND by "not showing up".  It is definitely both things together forming a perfect storm of shittiness (or awesomeness, depending on your viewpoint). 




 If Kennan Allen / Eddie Royal have the speed to complete short, quick passes against Sherman, then so does Emmanuel Sanders.

If Antonio Gates can catch three TDs from Phillip Rivers, then "Orange" Julius "Too Strong" Thomas can catch some from PFM.

Oh, and we'll have DT on Maxwell again, the lone bright spot of the Superbowl for our offense.

We'll be fine on offense.  If the defense can keep Seattle less than 40% on third down, I say we win. 




 No kidding.  If one of the beers pulled their sponsorship (or Nike!), you can bet Goodell would be out on his ass before the fucking ink was dry. 




 Currently residing in Madison.  Am aware not everyone has an outrageous northern midwest accent.

But every now and then there's a real doozy. 




 The truth Ertz. 




 Yes!!!  Gif available?  




 See?  I like this guy.  




 No see, bad calls make up 14 points and also playcalling which invites a turnover in the redzone.

Damn refs.  OP. 




 I can change.  You can change.  WE ALL CAN CHANGE!!! 




 Oh man.  That would be sweet. 




 I mean, they still have the Patriots and Bengals from their 1st place finish, then the Steelers and Ravens from the AFC North ( and the Browns sure don't look too shabby either).  And I know the NFC East is kinda the button of a lot of jokes over here, but sometimes those cowboys and Giants teams just decide to show up, and the Indigenous Persons just hung a 40 burger.  And then there is the division which is always a crapshoot (Broncos and Seahawks went 5-1 in their respective divisions last year,  for example).

They will be very fortunate to get to 11-5.  I would take the under. 




 FINALLY!  Someone got it. 




 Fair enough.   




 Was going for the [Ted Nugent band] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damn_Yankees_(band)), but that works, too. 




 You will be missed. 




 This is a non - sore loser, here.  /R/NFL, recognize.  




 I know.  Why cares what sex/gender the prosecutor is? 




 I have more than one female friend that would suck him off at a moment's notice (it came up in conversation,  okay?).  One male friend,  too. (NOT ME).

(Okay, me). 




 I don't think Elway can play an instrument . . . 




 I don't get it. 




 I am having fun making snooty comments all around.  Way fun. 




 Unless proceeded by, " . . . A narcotic." 




 Gruden even called it.  He said any throw needed to be safe.  Boom interception.  




 I think I owe Satan (or some obscure Norse or Egyptian God) for getting Elway.  I am well aware that six thousand things had to go a certain way for Elway to get traded to the Broncos (and not the Niners, Raiders,  etc), and at least one of them was that Irsay was an incompetent boob dealt a shitty situation by a spoiled brat Stanford Boy who wanted to play baseball for the Yankees. 




 Just think about his millions of dollars and your tens of dollars.  That will help. 




 Try out 5.0 yet?  Andrew can be our DM! 




 Ugh. How moist is it? 




 You really should capitalize, "King Neck Beard." 




 Likewise,  friend.

Fuck the Raiders. 




 Let me check . . . Oh.  It seems that Eagles are 2-0.  Oh my.  Colts are 0-2, as well.  Maybe just move on. 

(FYI: Broncos also 2-0) 




 It isn't nearly as bad as folk are making out.  There was a tug on T.Y.'s jersey that sent him to the floor as an interception happened, and then another tug to Shady ' s jersey that was knee - jerk ed as a whorescollar but wasn't.  Two fairly innocuous mistakes (but still mistakes).

But it wasn't any Superbowl 40 or Replacement refs Hail Mary touchdown. 




 Weird grudge to hold.  You stole a team, too. 




 Still better than the 3 point game in hockey. 




 Still stings?

Yeah, 43-8.  I know.

Still stings. 




 Shave head.  Solved.  

Maybe you even pull 9 a Heisenberg. 




 Hahahah.  What a dick.  Love it. 




 I need gif of zoom in on despondent Mr. Neck Beard. 




 Get fucked lady!   Khaki Man just bought yo groceries!!!

You gotta want it. 




 Pretty sure my neighbors think I am insane as I yell, "Sproles is too good . . . SPROLES OP . . . PLEASE NERF SPROLES!!!" As that screen unfolded. 




 "Get a ticket,  and go watch the Eagles play."

I call that for SAS. 




 He needs to tighten has hat. 




 Yeah, well, you know,  it's the Radisson, so it's pretty nice. 




 yeah, that is just inexcusably bad.  We could have had 1 full minute with at least 1 timeout, just in case they score.  Very very bad decisions.  




 I am happy with the win, for many reasons.

First, it is clear to me that absent many, many mental mistakes, this game would not have been nearly as close.  There were multiple 3rd and longs which were converted, and I put some of that on the defensive playcalling.  Malik's roughing was borderline bs, but still inexcusable.  Offside OMFG.  These are mental mistakes, and not deficiencies in scheme or talent.

You like to see the offense be better in the 2nd half, but so many 3 and outs, dropped balls, poor recognition of audibles has really cost us there.

The O line has been very inconsistent.   Sometimes they look dominant, and sometimes they look awful.  Chris Clark in particular had a horrible game.  But  Ball and C.J. ran well today regardless.

These are all fixable problems, and completely reasonable ones to have in games 1 and 2.  In the end, don't complain about 7 point victories where offense, defense, and special teams all play a significant role in the victory.   Go Broncos and Fuck The Raiders. 




 This was indeed poor, poor game management by Fox.   




 This is patently false.

No mere WR foot has a chance against the Manning Fivehead. 




 To be fair, he found out he had diabetes in his last year with us, and really dialed in his health that year. 




 Should I buy a PS4?  Semi-serious question.  I could get Destiny and The Last of Us and be happy for once. 




 I watched that movie on a lark one slow Netflix day, because sometimes things going explodey are fine.

It entertained me.  The main dude is kinda stupid, the acting wasn't any good, and I really didn't understand the alien motivation.  I wont watch it again, but I am not unhappy that I saw it.

Not the most ringing endorsement, perhaps, but better than an actual garbage fire like the most recent Spiderman or, I don't know, Transformers Too-High-A-Number. 




 Just like the wrong two Beatles died.

(credit to George Carlin, also incorrectly dead)
 




 There's no probably about it.

Did you ever hear about the Rolling Stone interview where they asked Steven Tyler what he thought the essence of Rock   Roll was?

"For me, Rock   Roll has always been about 'The Three Ms':  Music, Money, and Mmmmmmmm, Pussy!" 




 And Belcher!  There's plenty of misery to go around. 




 That was Carolina/SF, wasn't it? 




 MASSIVE penalties for the off-hand there, as I think pitchforks count as large weapons. 




 I hope you are right, but I would temper that optimism.  I think it is very possible that Goodell runs the old scapegoat play - if the AP reports that so-and-so *definitely* received a copy of the tape, Goodell could pin it all on this "fall guy" for not making the video the attention of everyone.

Not likely anyone would believe him, but this is a reasonable direction to expect.
 




 My grandfather used to say of Chiefs vs. Raiders, "Let's hope for a 0-0 tie, and they kill each other".  Not a man to mince AFC West hatreds.

I look at it another way:  when I loathe both teams, I just root for horrible things to happen to one or both of them (not injuries - I'm not a monster).  I want blocked field goals as time expires, or fumbles on the opening kickoff of overtime, or hail-mary passes from the 50 that get batted up in the air, and then dropped, only to have PI called so that a FB dive can get stuffed on an untimed down from the 1.  [Muffed punts late in the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USBAqX8QUEg), [huge blown leads](http://youtu.be/iZxSANhjCag?t=4m2s), [apparent fumbled return TDs foiled at the goal line] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjVNzbQF9jA), holding penalties on a 52-yard FG to win the game, [shanked extra points after a Stanford/Cal-like Hook-and-Ladder touchdown to "tie" the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTGco82JKHo) - these must be your desires when two despised foes go to battle. 




 China.  Duh.
 




 Not today. 




 And the coach deserves it.  Horrible game management.  




 Exactly.  When a team goes for 2 twice - they did something wrong. 




 I feel like that is a corollary to the YouTube comment rule:

There is no such thing as a youtube comment that is, "too stupid". 




 My first thought too. 




 That is always so awkward - I've been at games where it was clear the right call was against the Broncos' best wishes, but I am just one man - I can't tell every chanting hill person to quit their hollerin'. 




 I like when Boomer does a MNF or playoff baseball.

 




 Solved!  I did this and Chris said that they aren't allowed to do the field-level things this year.  A bummer, but oh well. 




 Good catch - I knew it was a casino, AKA, a place with some of the greatest surveillance on Earth, but mixed up the actual city.   




 I feel that *Joe Dirt* is vastly under-rated by the movie-watching public. 




 Oh, so TMZ can afford to buy the video, but the NFL can't persuade someone to just have access to it? 

You know, for a time-sensitive investigation into one if its players?

I call bullshit.  Most likely it went down like this (dramatized and exaggerated):

NFL: A star player hit his fiancee?  In vegas?  In front of how many cameras?

Video-haver:  Yes.  Many angles.  Elevator and everything.

NFL:  Well, should we see that?

Video-haver:  Probably, but it might cost you.

NFL:  Eh, fuck that - we'll make our decision based on hearsay and conjecture.  Those are *kinds* of evidence. 




 It's the wrong tone.  You do it again, I'll stab you in the face with a soldering iron. 




 So, I have looked all over the official Broncos website; it seems like they have discontinued the field-level highlights with the audio from the radio broadcast, in favor of having individual highlights with Logan's call.

Does anyone know if this is the direction they'll be going in the future for sure?  Are my field-level highlights all gone forever? 




 Manning is definitely not super crisp tonight.  




 It is not cool to just let plays like that go.  Officials you need to pull your heads out of your ass and stop relying on the replay booth to do your goddamn job.  People are going to get hurt chasing down people after a play should have been blown dead. 




 Honestly, I clicked on this expecting much, much worse.  I was actually reasonably impressed, despite the gigantic mistakes made in these arguments.  Obviously, I despise the conceit of framing the question this way in the first place - it puts defenders of Rand on the back foot and loads the deck against them (but, these two people don't care, and even consider it funny).  Interestingly, as others here have said, the contention that Rand is "nonsense" seems to be largely based on a basic misunderstanding:  Klavin believes that Rand is equivocating "altruism" and "selflessness". Klavin believes that the concept of selflessness is essentially impossible, in that one cannot be truly without self (at least, without dying), but altruism is a good, comprising the good feelings that you have when helping people.  The problem is, Rand never equivocates these concepts - she uses "altruism" as the well-understood ethical concept which has been agreed upon, and goes to show precisely how it **requires** selflessness, which is therefore impossible.  She is not equivocating - she is showing the relationship between the two.  Klavan simply misses the connection because his definition of "altruism" almost equates to "kindness", a phenomenon which Rand wrote and analyzed often.

That is why I was more pleased than I thought it would be.  This is a basic misunderstanding which could be rectified.  It isn't someone arguing from ignorance, mispronouncing Rand's name, and talking about how she condones Rape and killing of the poor.
