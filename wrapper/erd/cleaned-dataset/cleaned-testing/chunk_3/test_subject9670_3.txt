 ok, makes perfect sense ...

....so maybe not for phone calls (ie, won't address the whole 'replacement-of-the-telecoms' deal... where it comes to phone calls) .... but, for data maybe?

Personally *I'm* not that concerned... I have unlimited data and am around wifi often enough that it's not really a concern per se ... but I have friends that have limited to very-limited data packages....  in *this* instance... having a mesh network of sort seems like it could help both give them internet access (w/out the increased cost of paying for it) while at the same time, helping to drain my battery faster.

so, maybe not a full-on replacement of the telecoms, but definitely helping to readjust around the costs they put on their data?  




 why not? why couldn't the phones connect to wifi? ... then the internet... then another city?

so, you're driving down the street, your phone's connected to mine, mine, in turn, is connected to my at-home wifi network... and you're trying to call someone in another city in an inverse situation.

doesn't a *similar* thing happen when on skype or hangouts video/audio call when connected via cell network *and* wifi ... and you go to a part of the house where wifi suck but the cell signal is strong?  ...doesn't skype/hangouts ..../the cell phone itself  bridge the connection to the strongest signal and adjust accordingly?

the amount of data needed for decent-enough quality audio is surprisingly low (to me).

 of course it is. you were continually responding to me as if I was saying things that I wasn't.... just for the sake of seeing yourself type.

if you were actually addressing what I was saying then I'd've approached it one way .... but you didn't.

the original thing that you said was that the new cluster bomb systems have advanced considerably (paraphrasing of course)

and, yes, they absolutely have.

but, the systems that have upgraded the bombs don't *have* to be paired solely with cluster bombs ... or at least the general concept and advancements in technology don't.   ....as such, the need for cluster bombs themselves could be rendered largely moot... if not entirely moot.

*that's* what i was saying.   you then responded with.... the everything that you did that *didn't* address what I was saying.

you were making it an either/or.  i was saying there's a 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc alternative.

even *with* the drastic advancements in cluster bomb technology... the general 'concept' or 'label' of cluster bombs still allows for the old shit to still exist.

so, sure, for an analogy, we may have a bunch of Tesla's out there... but the vast majority of cars on the road are still gas guzzlers.

but, when 'they' advertise cluster bombs, they show these great, sexy-even, definitely impressive PR pieces of super accurate, small explosive rounds that take out a single target.

what they *don't* show are the mass quantity of cluster bombs still in supply ... and possibly use.

I'm not against bombing a target if bombing a target is what's needed ... what I'm against is dropping an unnecessary *quantity* of explosives over an area when just one or a few would do... ie, which is why they advertise these very accurate designs... *because* just one or two or a few are needed.

but, that's not the situation. the situation is that there are countless old model numbers out there... and they *don't* contain the advancements that modern tech allows for... and, as such... when *they're* used ... because they're *able* to *be* used because those that choose *not* to sign cluster bomb bans choose *not* to ban cluster bombs because in *their* mind there're these new super accurate designs that would *also* be banned.... ... well... those bomblets ... .they kill kids man.

look at the images of it.  and it's not just a few here and a few there... as if that wasn't bad enough... it's a lot. of. fucking. kids.

so, fuck me? no man. i'm not the one arguing to *keep* kid maiming, kid killing weapons systems that the vast majority of the world has chosen to *ban* in continued use... so, honestly? yeah I'm fucking smug. and, quite frankly? you got off light vs how much of a fucking dick I *could've* been about it.


get your head out of your ass and actually pay attention to wtf someone's saying to you vs going off on whatever the fuck you went off on instead ... may save *all* parties involved a lot of time. yourself included

[American Scientist: Does Peak Phosphorus Loom?](http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/does-peak-phosphorus-loom)  - July/Aug 2010

[New Projection of Peak Phosphorus](http://www.resilience.org/stories/2013-08-29/new-projection-of-peak-phosphorus) - Sept 2013

(may also try googling: 'Peak Phosphorus myth' ... as a healthy mix of contrast is always a good idea)

but, *one* solution is to incorporate more [phosphate solubilizing bacteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate_solubilizing_bacteria) into biofertilizers...    which, as much as the fungi may help to 'shuffle' P into plants... they're most likely *getting* the P via a symbiotic relationship with PSBs already in the soil.

Also, SumaGrow is a mix of [diazotrophs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazotroph) (I've read 50+ different strains in some literature, 30+ strains in others). ... but one of their PR guys did a talk at a conference a few years back (can't find the youtube video now, believe it's been pulled... otherwise I'd provide a link) ... but, in it he says that four of the strains included in SumaGrow are PSBs... and because they felt that they had an excellent product built around a very rich understanding of diazotrophs, they were now (then.. the vid is a few years old) beginning to shift their focus towards PSBs... ...no word on what's going on with *that* product line, but *that* the company has pulled the video? (assuming that it was them that did), I'd imagine that this 'revelation' could've been a reason behind it.

Of course PSBs don't 'solve' the peak phosphorus 'deal'... but, from that video and elsewhere, we've been heavily fertilizing with P for over half a century now... ...and, from what I gather, there's actually *plenty* of P in most of the farmed soils.. ...the problem is, it's not bioavailable for the plants.  The P in fertilizer-form is readily available for the plants, and/or breaks down quickly in such that *becomes* readily available for plants... ...but, that this 'window of availability' closes by the end of the season due to P's affinity to binding with other 'elements' in the soil (be them individual elements or larger molecules)...  ....and, the bond-types that it forms are too strong for plants-alone to break.

this is where the PSBs come in... with their 'hammer   cleave' enzymatic 'action', they're able to break the P free, use it for 'whatever' reason they use it for... and when they die, the P that they freed up is now in a bioavailable form for the plants to utilize ... before the process repeats itself (either binding to other elements... ...or becoming usurped by yet more PSBs... ...or being utilized by the plant).

With that, there's 'supposedly' *decades* of phosphorus in the soils... ... it's just a matter of making it (bio)available for the plants ... thus, biological fertilizers (fungal, microbial, 'etc') ....

this drastically increases efficiency, and can prob help make it to the end of the century before 'Peak P' becomes a '*huge*' issue...   even sticking with the seemingly accepted date of 2027 being 'Peak P year' ...  ('peak' by no means means end-year... so will still definitely be decades more mineable P available ... ...plus the potential for discovery of new P deposits... advances in mining technology, etc.

'*hope*fully' by then these seeming-'magical' advanced energy technologies that've been '50 years away' for the past 60 years *finally* come available and we can more efficiently begin to utilize advanced desal technologies in such that the *various* trace minerals (P-included) can be more-efficiently extracted from the runoff of P *in*to the oceans ....   ....and create a near-endless supply of *all* elements from that point on..  ...[SeaAgri, Inc](http://www.seaagri.com/) gets *their* minerals from desal 'waste'.    ...   ....as well a few other random/competing trace mineral companies out there  ... that, from what I understand, they essentially get *paid* to take a desal 'waste' product off the hands from desal companies (*that* desal companies would otherwise have to pay to 'dispose of' by other means if not paying *these* companies to 'do something with it') .. and these companies, in turn, process it... (remove the salt... an obvious industry   product in   of itself) and provide the minerals as a*nother* product for ... well... the ag industry to utilize. 

Personally? I don't *really* see peak P as being a *huge* issue.... .... per se.... but definitely something worthy of being aware of (imo), as well, something that should be included in adjustments around ag approaches.   As runoff accounting becomes an ever-increasing issue, and as drought/water becomes all the more an issue (which helps to improve irrigation efficiencies ... in such that there's less water *to* promote runoff to begin with) ... (there's an upside to everything, right? 'sad' it's gotta be taken to that extreme before things are done but... such is laziness) ... as well an increase in indoor farming... which usually recycles much of the resources to begin with.. water, soils, nutrients, etc...  ....and, as a shift from more field-based crops (corn, wheat, soy, etc) continues .... with foresight and a lot of 'luck' ... hopefully the whole thing can be sidestepped ... at least for the masses.  the bottom ~20% will seemingly-always get crapped on one way or another ... unfortunately.

  You could use other bombs

um, i *know*... that's kinda my point

 and they do

as we've already established

 There are lots of different smart bombs

as we've also already established

 some of which are simply "dumb" bombs affixed with a guidance mechanism and the countermeasures you suggest

haven't all those gulf war 1 bombs been upgraded and/or dropped by now??  (sarcasm)

 I still don't understand how having ten planes drop 10 bombs is better than having one plane drop one bomb with the same effect.

I didn't realize that this was [1917 and we were still limited](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breguet_14#Specifications_.2814B.2.29) to 1 bomb per plane? wait, no... no... they could carry 300kg back then... that means we could have 10 30kg bombs! crazy! why would it take 10 planes to drop 10 bombs???

... ok. [here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q0Ulciz6fE): 1 plane, 1 bomb 

or, [1 plane multiple bombs](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/B-2_spirit_bombing.jpg)  .... now imagine if each of those bombs were smaller, smart, and capable of landing on a single target.... w/out the need for countless other bomblets needlessly *not* hitting anything of vital importance.

  Fewer chances to miss and hit civilians

with smart guided singular bombs targeting a specific target vs 'countless' bomblets blowing up over an area? yes. absolutely. much less likely for collateral damage

excellent track record of reducing civilian casualties, let [me tell ya](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/study-says-almost-all-cluster-bomb-victims-are-children-422743.html)

 lower fuel cost
 
if going with your asinine 'ten planes for ten bombs' theory? sure. but, as this has already been dismissed as fucking idiocy... then... no, not really

transporting the same weight would generally cost the same amount of money.  but, since higher accuracy would allow for a smaller payload ... then going with smarter targeting systems could possibly *cut* weight and thus fuel costs... 

 you can allocate resources to different areas

again, still this 'ten planes/ten bombs' mindset?

 Plus these explosives are tiny

and, oftentimes so are their victims (see last link)

tiny? and accurate!? you're definitely getting the idea now!   ... and w/*out* the countless other tiny little bombs that *aren't* needed

 you can use a small warhead to penetrate the armor and destroy it

sounds smart.  so, one could use a small bomb intelligently placed to take out a tank? vs dropping lots of them? crazy!  ...and we don't get the unexploded bomblet deal that blows up civilians? poisons the environment? and dismembers little kids? wow! we're talkin' progress!!

 I obviously wouldn't recommend dropping these on civilian areas

and yet there are many claims of this having happened.... and in very recent history

 The precision nature of the weapons makes it the best choice even for that situation

yet still not as 'precise' as a yet-smarter bomb... ...that doesn't blanket an area with countless unneeded bomblets



  guess my biggest problem with what you're saying is that I can't formulate a hypothetical argument for why using more bigger bombs would mitigate civilian casualties. 

go back through *every*thing that I said.  please copy   paste where I was arguing for bigger bombs.  please do that for me. because if you can, *then* your points will finally start to make sense.  but, that I didn't... ....well, maybe that will help to make you more aware of why I'm .... taking such a tone with you.  you're coming at me responding to statements that I simply. didn't. make!

 that last clusterfuck of a sentence to read

take that shape charge. mount it to an intelligent guidance system. drop it from a plane. have it land on top of a tank. blow up into the tank (or target). directing its charge directly into it.  *that's* what I want. *not* countless bomblets all over the place. ...potentially *not* exploding ... until in the hands of a 4 year old girl out on a walk with her 9 year old brother and their family dog. 




 I like [biochar](/r/biochar) personally... but I felt that anything along this lines would be of interest to the /r/green community  




 yeah, but... can you then gasify the plants via pyrolysis and store the carbon in [such a way](/r/biochar) that it accelerates the sequestering of yet more carbon, faster ... *and* cut water, fertilizer, pesticides, and other inputs.... *while* providing a source of storable energy? 




  Why bother?

why not? I mean, if the design works so well when attached to *that* weapons system, why not attach it to others as well?

 I don't understand why they are inherently evil because they are cluster bombs.

I never said they were??

 I think you are inherently misunderstanding the nature of this weapon

no. I understand them pretty well :)

 It's an anti-vehicle weapon

with reports of it being dropped in civilian areas

 If you were to use one normal 1,000 pound bomb, you would expect to destroy one target. It's just massive overkill when you have a bomb which can destroy over ten vehicles with the same size payload.

are there not lighter bombs than 1'000 pound'ers?

 which can destroy over ten vehicles with the same size payload

which is 'great' when it's not in a heavily populated civilian area and you need to take out 10 vehicles at once.

 which roasts everything inside of it instantaneously.

I was under the impression that the gases were also poisonous as hell?

that first link (EFP) looks a helluva lot smaller and more accurate than a 1'000lb bomb

last link? still looks a helluva lot smaller than a 1k# bomb

to understand what I'm trying to convey?  I repeated myself like 5x. you may be mixing up my message with others?    I said: if they have this greatly described system of accuracy   such... can't they also apply that to *other* 'bombs' besides *just* cluster bombs?  in such a way that it doesn't have to be used on *just* cluster bombs?   and, if so, it seems like possibly even more accurate, smaller, and thus less potential for collateral damage weapons *than* cluster bombs... could be possible.   ...ie, like the two *much* smaller than 1k# weapons you provided links to.

 couldn't they apply those same safeguards and what nots to non-clusterbombs though?   I mean, they seem like they're relatively separate systems wed together to act as one.

just remove the cluster bomb portion and replace it with ... ... some of those dumb bombs?

I mean, why's it have to be either/or? if they're developing new cluster bombs, couldn't they just as easily divert the funds to new... dumb bombs?  




 I had two or three of its predecessors; Rio, mp3 cd player, and some other gadget I've long since forgotten the name of.... The first iPod really blew them out of the water...in more ways than just advertising.

I think the same potential lay here ...obviously battery systems have existed for quite some time now,...hell, even back up energy systems in general... but I'm of the opinion, and this is obviously just speculation, but..I think tesla has the know how, drive, and understanding of this to really be just as 'revolutionarily' progressive in its potential. 




 ...as well a great design 




 from [this](http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/effects-drinking-alcohol-empty-stomach-have-your-body-331188) 




 Yeah, but sales of mp3 players drastically increased after its introduction 




 Because there's no previous precedent for the Catholic church backing European leaders who were waging a war where 'infidels' were being systematically massacred 




 The iPod wasn't the first portable mp3 player either... Crazy what great design can accomplish  




 ... $4t buys a lot.  ... investing it in an infrastructure that.... well, hell, [investing it in infrastructure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpzvaqypav8) is a good enough place to start....  ....but investing it in an infrastructure that is *not* dependent upon fossil fuels...

...both for transportation *and* for the grid (the two pretty much go hand-in-hand) would've cost much less and returned much more.

 actually, in looking back over it again (within context of this comment-thread)...

the Biochar Production section (pg 3)  .... the pdf won't let me copy   paste but it says that ... shit, i'll type it out.

 The pyrolysis was a two-stage process involving feedstock having a short exposure to temperatures of 700C to 750C and then having a relatively longer exposure to a lower-T sweep gas.

followed by

 A limited amount of O was available at the beginning of the process, rather than an exclusively anaerobic carbonization as is common in most biochar production

I really doubt the 'immediate oxygen' would really have a major effect on the process



but, at (all of!) that... 700-750C is plenty hot enough to cook out most VOCs... ...as well, the additional second lower temperature step '*seems*' like it'd take care of anything additional that hadn't worked its way out.

 and the particle size range (0.5-2.0mm)  seems more than 'small-enough' to allow for good diversity of char throughout the soil.


it's unlikely that the quality of the char... and/or that VOCs within the char played anywhere *near* a significant variable in the results.  .... for all intents   purposes, it seems like it was likely some really good char? 




 yours was definitely the tl;dr version :)

 unless it's 'cooked' at higher temperatures.

higher Ts do a few things that improve the quality of the char

1) increase the porosity *and* activation of the char

2) 'cook-out' the bio-oils, 'waxes', and other VOCs that serve to *repel* 'things' from the char .. ...until they're finally broken down

3) the 'weaker' C-C bonds are simply broken and gasified ... leaving the char with the rest of the gas stream... and the ones that remain behind *tend* to have stronger C-C bonds, hold together longer, and overall, provide for a more stable, longer-lasting, and all-'round 'better' char.

though... there is a 

D) to this... and that is: there'll be less resulting biochar from the source feedstock... and the char that *does* remain, *being* both more porous *and* more activated... will pull in all the more nutrients from the soil, and faster... and possibly hold onto 'tighter'... causing the soil to take a harder initial 'hit'  before it all works itself out.

but, the advantage to this is *) *if* the char is 'weathered' first ... or, better, pre-blended with nutrients, minerals, compost, other amendments, microbes, etc ... and *then* worked into the soil.. ....it will not *only* be 'loaded up', but it will begin to near-immediately work itself into the rest of the soil in such a way that there's almost an immediate improvement to the soil... ...and, with only more to come as the biota in the soil (plants included... but fungi, microbes, etc) help to make those pre-blended nutrients all the more bioavailable *to* the soil.

 Pro tip: Inefficient irrigation methods waste water, but lining ditches to improve efficiency can prevent wastewater from refilling aquifers. Lose/lose. So, thats not really a tip.

again, yet another sub dedicated to it: /r/irrigation

and, yes, irrigation methods 'waste' water. .... ....but, then, from the perspective of rain fall relative to farming, so do 'the gods' when it comes to keeping the water to the crops, lawns, and other places that need it.. ...that's why there are different forms of irrigation, some that are *much* more efficient than others... ... drip irrigation is just one.   not to mention better retention methods for the water that either soaks it into the ground better, or that captures it and recycles it back to the top of the hill again so that it gets another shot of getting absorbed.

 Pro tip: While waiting for the hot water to warm up, collect the water going down the drain and use it to water plants. Go to wateruseitwisely.com for another 189 ways to conserve water at home. (Bonus pro tip: Beware the silent toilet leak!)

wait, i thought this whole 'gray water' idea was nonsense? (who the hell spells 'grey' with an 'a' to begin with? it's such an 'ugly' way to spell the word vs 'grey' ... hell, the e even makes it *look* 'grey')

 I edited my previous comment because I was being retarded at the time I wrote it.   ...the edit may clarify my thoughts towards the first part.

Yeah, I *remember* reading about that... but, it was thorium in a blend, right? like, either some of the pebbles were thorium, some weren't, or some of the balls had thorium mixed in with them and some weren't ... and the ratios of that were mixed around based on the readings from the reactor as it 'aged' .... so, the next pebble-types were fed in based upon what the whole thing needed to keep itself going.

It was also one of the ways (read: fuel types) that PBMRs were helping to process old fuel-waste and bring it down to safer   easier levels for storage.

It's been a while since I've read about PBMRs. I think they're a great reactor design... seem super-stable, very practical.   There's something about them that reminds me of that child-like fashion Google tried to present itself as being in The Internship.  ... make the balls the different google-colors and have it all fun and innocent and childlike ... while still being productive and relatively 'cutting edge'.    ....clean too.

...and, of course, salt can still be used as a temporary energy store between the reactor and the water for the turbines (though it seems redundant).

but... I still think LFTRs make more sense to invest money towards.  Like, if there's going to be a heated push for the billions in capital needed to get funding towards a 'new' nuclear approach.... I feel like reviving LFTRs would make more sense than building another PBMR  ... these things make sense for some country that wants to become a bit more independent, wants to create stability to their country's energy infrastructure while also remaining a bit independent ... and, wanting to also send a very clear message to the world that they're both 'advanced' (enough to do nuclear) but also 'not looking to fight' ... and, even, instead... looking to help 'clean-up' the problems of the world (by not only *not* making weapons grade fuel... but by actually helping to burn some *up*) .... very practical design but kinda just 'safe   boring'  ....and I don't feel any real progress per se towards the advancement of nuclear reactor design-types ... ...vs LFTRs or, say, throwing money behind a Bussard Polywell.

I just gather that LFTRs can burn up a *lot* more nuclear waste ... and a *lot* faster ... while also helping serve to 'clean up' the nuke industry 




 [Intracranial Mapping of a Cortical Tinnitus System using Residual Inhibition](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822\(15\)00278-X) 




 well, molten salt's just an energy carrier... like water or oil or other...

you can technically do a molten salt reactor with 'anything' that'll heat the specific salt-type up ... coal, n.gas, geothermal, solar, etc

more talking LFTR's specifically ... 

edit: clearly I was being an idiot.   yeah. I mean molten salt reactors.   but... i had my part in the step wrong.  I was thinking about using molten salt as the heat medium, *not* ... ... the reactor itself.

You're right.  but, I was more-referring to LFTRs specifically vs MSRs in their more general sense 




 been in the construction industry a *long* time... you meet people.   or, you get a license and get it yourself. ... or, you could always make a bomb, but i'm not sure black powder has enough of a 'kick' to do it right. 

could always get some stump remover, burn it down, or hire a stump remover crew to come take it out for you.

the gasoline trick works too... for burning it down.  just soak it in gasoline... as much as you can ... drill some holes to really get it in there... and just let it soak. keep throwing a bit more on there then let it soak in and repeat ... amount depends on stump size.

but, this works a lot better when it's cold out... the gas may evaporate away too quickly otherwise.  ... kerosene works too, it's heavier, sits longer, but it's also thicker and doesn't soak in as well. 

then just light it... depending on how much you soaked in you may need to create a 'fuse' or something just 'cause it may burst pretty big ... I've heard grill fluid works too but i've never tried it.

once you burn it down (it will most *definitely* smoke.. a lot... but if you aren't worried about blasting with dynamite i seriously doubt you'll be worried about some smoke ... once it gets going you could always set up a charcoal grill near it to try   cover it up? grill some burgers while you watch it burn down?) 

once it's burned down you can usually just kick the rest of it in and shovel it up.   ... or throw on more gas and keep burning 




 I was talking about dynamiting tree stumps 




 Yeah, we only lost one tree out of the ~50 we ever transplanted.  ...but the 'crunching sound' still just seems painful.

I also made it a point to start using PHC Tree Saver after that first one died. ...it was probably the second or third one we ever used it on and it may've been too big to transplant. 




 You can use it for both, but there are stumped grinders for stump removal.

More fun though is using a quarter stick of dynamite   a drill

I've moved many trees with one of these (used to own one).
What's *not* captured by the gif is the sound! The tree roots are *not* fans.

...and it's *rarely* **that** clean of a process.

Grinding stumps (had a stump grinder too) is no where near as fun as blowing it up. 




 it was a joke  ... don't get all puffy. 




 I used to be a big fan of the concept behind PBMR's ... I mean, compared to what's actually in-use, what's *not* to love?

....but, then the 'thorium fanboy madness' struck the nuclear energy world and...well... Comparatively, thorium, on paper at least, just makes more sense to direct the finite amount of funding available towards pursuing *that* line of R D ...vs PBMRs.

Obviously that's just an opinion (mine), but logistically, it seems a more fruitful   efficient line of investment

 who! I think you totally misinterpreted my intention there! 

I wasn't 'comparing' the two in that way, was more just trying to say that people sitting around and accepting that things are they way they are doesn't lead to progress.

There has been a *lot* of progress towards autism. ... and, though a '100% bang-on '*cure*'' hasn't been discovered, there have been a lot of breakthroughs on both the understanding of the physiology of it, as *well* the behavioral understandings and therapeutic approaches towards helping those with it adjust and adapt in ways that *wouldn't* have likely been 'discovered' or 'developed' had people simply 'accepted' the understandings of it prior *to* those willing   wanting to evolve said understanding.

I wasn't trying to ... do what you are implying that I was.

I also haven't really even stated my point of view on it for you to know whether I've changed it or *not*. but, after multiple exchanges and no real advancement in conversation, I'm in agreement that ending any future discussion about it is probably the best course at this point. 




 They have transcripts for a lot of their other videos around the site, I'm sure if you sent them a request for transcripts for these they'd do them.

There aren't that many video-interviews with her out there (or at least there weren't last time I checked), and clearly her claims have stirred up a lot of public interest... I'm sure they'd comply if they got a request to.  

 That's where the "cure autism" movement comes from, people who don't accept autistics.

or just don't like sitting around and dealing with a set of scenarios as life has seen fit to hand to them .. ..people tend to like to be more proactive than that.  I can't blame them. 100 years ago, polio was a problem. Now, polio's less of a problem.  change what you can, accept what you can't.  we didn't go to the moon because we simply accepted that it was too far away. 




 how would it not? 

If we knew with 100% certainty how it's caused, it seems like we could do something about it.

wouldn't acceptance come *through* awareness of it to know *to* accept it?

edit: here's [the link to the interview-videos](https://www.ihealthtube.com/aspx/contributors.aspx?sp=335) with Stephanie Seneff.   I think being able to see her body language, her syntax, her vocal emphasises, etc puts a face to all the headlines, articles, 'coverage in general' surrounding her. 




 Was behind a car just yesterday with an Autism Awareness state-issued license plate.

Not enough interest in autism: people think the lack of attention   ignorance towards it is ridiculous and run 'campaigns' to 'raise awareness' 

Too many papers published with too many different theories: people complain that there's too much going on with it

Really a no win all around 




 She was interviewed on ihealthtube.com a few months back...and though I question the merits of both this article, as well any direct correlations between glyohosphate   autism, and esp any direct glyphosphate has with *causing* autism, her interview was 'interesting' to watch nonetheless.

I'll try to remember to provide a direct link to it when I get a chance.

 original paper: [CyTOF supports efficient detection of immune cell subsets from small samples.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25450003) 




 wall o'text - part II

~~about to run out of characters~~ ran out of characters but... the point of all of that was, this starts to cut into the fossil fuel demand, while at the same time fitting very nicely *in*to its infrastructure (syngas *is* short for synthesis gas after all... and, as such, can be up-converted *to* methane and ethane and.. well, like cool planet's doing, 'grassoline') if not straight replace it...     biomass gasification in such that biochar is a resulting product is not just the only form of energy out there that's carbon *negative*, it's also pretty much the only *thing* that's out there that's carbon negative... that's not just been used every day for centuries, but that's been made naturally since lighting caught the first field on fire before the subsequent thunderstorm put out the fire before it all burned to ash.


um, well, since i have a whole new set of room here.... 

let me expand on that.  solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric (tidal and other included), subsequent [energy storage](/r/energystorage) ...nuclear   fusion -even are, at best, carbon neutral.   and, in truth, there are *so* many parts of that process along the manufacturing   servicing lines of those respective industries that are carbon+, they're not really a solution to the 125-150 ppm carbon increase over the past 150+ years.   

really, in truth, *only* something like this will do it. and, on an industrial scale.  but, it isn't just that this is carbon neutral or carbon negative, if scaled up to the level we've al*ready* scaled up our corn   soy industries for the production of biofuel, it almost-entirely neutralizes at least the US's carbon emissions from transport fuels.     ...almost, but not quite.  it'd need to be scaled up farther.. unfortunately... because that means imposing on yet *more* yet-to-be-touched lands... and, again, like how solar/wind/geothermal/etc have a 'smaller footprint' relative to clean energy.. *though* countless acres of cultivated switchgrass fields are *more*-friendly than corn, soy, oil fields, or coal mines... they're still not 'natural'.   so, there's kinda-sorta that aspect of the whole thing.  ...it still has an environmental footprint, is my point to it.

um, from an energy-required perspective, [Algenol](http://www.algenol.com/) and others are doing *awesome* work with [algae](/r/algae).  a google search on the health benefits   superfood qualities of chlorella and spirulina will be quick to show the potentials with *that* approach from a food perspective ... .... but, on a *fuel* angle, Algenol honestly is superior to switchgrass, miscanthus, hemp, and any other 'super crop' out there.    Algenol's ceo touts repeatedly in [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlSwFaxIyzo) that every acre of Algenol far outpaces corn/soy.  I believe the average amount of ethanol from corn is like 150-170 (160?) gallons per acre per year and ~57 gallons of biodiesel per acre of soy  .... lets be nice and combine those into a single field for crop rotation.. though this isn't the case.  that's 225 gallons of each a year in a mixed bag (I'm being nice   rounding up)

The CEO of Algenol repeatedly touts 9'000 gallons of ethanol per acre per year *plus* an additional ~1'500 gallons a year from a mixed bag of longer hydrocarbon chains ... from pure hydrogen   methane (shorter) all the way up to diesel's c20H42 ... and all the fuel types in between (kerosene, jet fuel, .... 'gasoline' even).  so, 10'500 gallons of 'fuel' per acre per year.  vs corn/soy's politely rounded up 225.     now, algenol's process is closer to the carbon neutral side of things... though, they *do* buy CO2 from power plants to make it carbon negative... i see it as a great mix with switchgrass... and have heard rumor that Cool Planet's facilities in Louisiana and Algenol's Florida facilities are in talks for hybriding their approach on future designs... though, that could just be rumor fodder.

but badass rumor fodder! and the kinda stuff that even if it *is* 'just-rumor' that'll hopefully the type that gets something going?

but, you can set up algenol facilities on places you wouldn't even think to set up switchgrass facilities so... there's that aspect as well.   I see it as a 'scaled model'... going with the solve for x video diagrams   representations Mike Cheiky showed... you could do a central processing ring of facilities... surrounded by a ring of algenol... surrounded by a ring of switchgrass greenhouses... surrounded by an outermost ring of field-grown switchgrass.... and both increase those circle-sizes, as well give them a new reason to 'awe' us as we [fly over them](http://goo.gl/iM3u3w). 

but... algenol's algae could always be 'cooked down' to provide raw hydrogen (it *is* more hydrogen dense and/or faster growing than switchgrass) ... for *that* aspect of the fuel... ...but, it's no where *near* lignocellulosic enough (not even sure you can call it 'lignocellulosic') for biochar production... all the carbon would just straight-gasify.  you'd get no to essentially-no biochar from it.  so, thus, carbon neutral at best.   even the 'carbon negativity' of it is... temporary... as, sure the smokestack CO2 makes it carbon negative ... but, when you burn the fuels from it, it's carbon neutral.   need the biochar for carbon negativity.



at that... switchgrass.   this stuff is awesome at soil building. 

the roots grow as deep to deeper than what's above ground.  when harvested, the photosynthesis (or lack there of ... the crop's been cut down to ~6 inches) can't support the roots below... the plant chemically cauterizes them off... if they're big enough, they take hold and become a new plant. most die... decompose in the soil.  ...adding to the SOC (soil organic carbon) there.   98% of the carbon in a plant is from the CO2 inhaled. inevitably there's some in the water the plant pulls in.  a plant is built from the air.  the roots included.  those now-dying-dead-decomposing roots help improve the soil quality and retain nutrients.  2/3rds of carbon is in the soil.  the healthier soil will enrich   promote more soil biota... and sequester *far* more carbon than both the plant *and* the biochar could ever hope to.  the biochar will just help to keep it all there longer.

i'm cutting this rant short. it's more than too long as is. but i'm out of time and it's the second part to the already-sent last one 




 here, check this vid out

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkYVlZ9v_0o

It's 'old' at this point... Cheiky is someone who they brought in to do initial PR for them, to help raise capital for where they were at the time ... ...to get to where they are now...

they've 'moved forward' since, and I haven't seen anything about him in their media for about 2 years? ... but that's his m.o., he's more an initial / ground-work funding type of guy.

but, their 'first official plant's' ribbon cutting ceremony was back in Sept '14.... and they're moving forward more with their biochar product.  

...I can't find their ribbon cutting ceremony vid to give you a link but... ....biochar isn't going to be their main deal. like, they aren't going to run it to produce biochar (most of the time).  ...but, inevitably there'll be *some* char produced.

....and they've steadily been increasing their biochar product and biochar product pr... though most of that seems focused on their california facilities (their 'trial' facilities) not their mississippi/ Louisiana operations, though it seems capable of it from how it sounds...  ...from their president's remarks in the opening ribbon cutting deal.

but, their model is 'modular' and set up for a kinda-sorta decentralized distribution of facilities... scaling up each site in size, as well as developing multiple sites around.

but, this makes sense with biomass... ...it's not dense enough to justify shipping it very far (as Cheiky says in the Google Solve For X video).

*If* the model is advanced forward from where it was in the solve for x vid though... ...and the switchgrass is grown *not* for liquid transport fuels (or less for it anyway)...

...and it's instead grown for its 'raw energy content' (read: hydrogen / syngas production), and their 'ovens' are more set to just 'cook' the switchgrass and produce a lot of char and a lot of syngas...

...and the process is tied into something like GE's CO2 fertilization designs

1) [link 1](http://goo.gl/szx2yi)

2) [link 2](http://goo.gl/02ky5F)

3) [link 3](http://goo.gl/7lhrwX)

whereby the 'waste heat' produced is used to first dry the incoming materials (need to get the biomass at a 15% moisture content level ... think 'dry or aged firewood') and then use the other 'waste heat' produced in a co-generation or tri-generation set up (to heat or to cool a greenhouse or other facility) ... the syngas to power a turbine first producing power for the production facilities, then the greenhouse lighting, fan, etc facilities, and then selling the rest on the grid as electricity... ....or selling/blending the syngas either as a n.gas substitute, or blending it with n.gas kinda like ethanol w/ gasoline ...   

...the problem with doing this with syngas is it's pretty much CO+H2   ... and H2 just doesn't store well. it's too small.  it's better to straight-burn the H2 or separate out the CO... well, first, step up the CO to CO2 (catalytic converter) and then 'distill' it out ... the CO2 weighs a *lot* more than the H2 so they can be separated ... albeit, at expense... and then the H2 can be handled as 'hydrogen is handled'  ... toyota's hydrogen cars, for example, or other hydrogen markets.. ...or, again, probably best just straight-burned on site (again, just too expensive to store it) and then the electricity put onto the grid... .... like solar/wind vs n.gas.  it's a lot easier to [store](/r/energystorage) n.gas than it is electricity ... cheaper too... ...and then just 'hold off on' the n.gas until this isn't there or burn the n.gas to supplement where these facilities aren't meeting local demand.  but, this stuff first... n.gas making  up the rest.  ..but, design [the grid](/r/thegrid) that renewables (like this) take priority over electricity from 'fossil fuels' ....

anyway, the CO2 separated out of the gas stream... the CO stepped up to CO2... and separated out .... ... can be used to feed the greenhouses (*not* mentioned in the solve for x video) .... now, of course, the *main* market for these is going to be for food-crops. they're simply going to bring in more money.   ...and I'll let ge's much better funded (I do this as a 'hobby') marketing team explain the science   benefits behind that (for more, google: 'greenhouse carbon fertilization' or 'co2 greenhouse fertilization' or something along those lines... ge isn't the *only* company doing this (can't find the link I was looking for).   ... well, food crops are both smarter and higher value for this... ...then, indoor switchgrass facilities.   obviously greenhouses of switchgrass isn't the greatest idea from a profit perspective, but with it, you can increase from an average of 2.5 harvests a year (2 one year, 3 the next... average 2.5 harvests... for switchgrass)... to about 4 harvests a year. 

but, not just that, the switchgrass grows *much* faster, so, each harvest being faster growing it's closer to *five* harvests a year in volume vs outdoor grown switchgrass (I set up /r/switchgrass to post links like this.... to make them easier to find *and* to link to but, unfortunately, I did a lot of that research be*fore* I set up /r/switchgrass, and haven't gotten back around to doing it again... so, you'll just need to do the research yourself to back up those results but it'll be somewhere in searches like: 'switchgrass greenhouse growth rates' and the such. i know that reads like a cop out, but, trust me, it's out there... ...mostly in published journal papers. not fun nor easy to pick through).

but, yeah, the thing with it is... *if* done that way, there's a *near*-100% loop in it all.   The sulfur (that biogas so notoriously contains) is filtered out of the gas stream via desulfurization... and turned *back* into sulfur-product for field application (sulfur's an *extremely* [important element for plants](http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/soil-fertilizers/sulfur-in-plants.htm)).   um, the atmosphere is ~79% N... you can't pull in air from the outside world to mix in the turbine's fuel-to-air ratio w/*out* N being there... ...thus, subsequently, there're NxOx's that need to be broken down... as well CO molecules that need to be upgrade-completed to CO2 ... ie, after the gas stream is desulphurized, send the exhaust through a catalytic converter ([essentially](http://goo.gl/Io5Xqt)) ... but, *don't* release it....

the resulting CO2 is fertilizer, the O2 is... lessened anyway, obviously less of a priority to keep but since you're sorting your gases might as well do something with it, there's of course an industry for pure O2, H2O... pure water? yeah, there's a market for that... if nothing else, it's water for your crops / greenhouses, and the N2 .... ....N2 is the form plants need nitrogen to be in.  [microbes called diazotrophs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazotroph) utilized in produces like [SumaGrow](http://www.sumagrow.com/) sprayed onto the crops (read: switchgrass) take the increased N2 being pumped into the greenhouse ... along with the CO2... and pull it into the soil and make it available for the plants.   (great time to reference the importance of sulfur here). 

this pretty much recycles the vast majority of the emissions from the biochar gasification right back into growing more crops for energy   biochar ... ...and, of course, the other result from all of this *is* .. biochar.    which can then be incorporated into the soils of both the greenhouses or fields... or sold as product. ... or both, just depending on how they want to go about it. ...and the market for it.

lastly is the inevitable amount of flyash produced.   ash is minerals. the potash industry is still in a bit of a glut right now, but... that ash can be mixed right back with the biochar and... incorporated back into the soil.  it was in the switchgrass for a reason: the plants pulled it into themselves.   they do this because they need it... so, add it back into the soils and the next crop can do it again.


do this on a wide enough scale... read: build enough greenhouses... or just open fields.. but, up-convert the open fields into a greenhouse model where funding allows (again, it's more efficient and allows for production year-round... so, cost wise it *does* pay for itself, it's just a little lower profit margins vs open-field... ..but, it can be invested-in from a 'efficiency perspective'  ... like paying more money up front to retrofit a field or a building... only to have it pay itself back in savings over the next few years.  sure it costs more out of pocket... but, sometimes it's better to invest in what you have and upgrade it rather than to continue to expand like a necessary biochar producing switchgrass cancer on the landscape.

it also allows for more energy in a denser format and, as such, more land to be returned to a more-natural order.   as great as switchgrass is, and as 'native' of a grass it is, esp over corn   soy.. it's still a monoculture crop... and, though animals can utilize it quite comfortably   effectively, it doesn't compare to the natural polyculture of a field.... but, with the essential doubling in energy produced from a greenhouse, as well the upgrading of outdoor/non-greenhouse'd fields with the biochar produced from both ... more land *can* be returned to a more natural form.


 




 They are: Cool Planet

It's beginning to scale up.

There's obvious resistance of course. It goes against the profits of existing, well established, deeply entrenched industries that are better subsidized and have a lot more money. 




 
the tl;dr of that: I feel there's no real need for subsidies because the benefits will far outweigh the costs in that the farm will quickly recoup any initial 'hits' they take out of pocket for making, purchasing, and implementing it.  




  Oh I didn't know there was a subreddit for that thanks!

there's a sub for it, unfortunately I'm the only one who ever really posts to it.  I'm also the mod so... help me out! find good articles about it and post away! :)

 IMO widespread implementation of biochar subsidies

in truth? I don't even think the subsidies are necessary.

Personally, I think subsidies are, for the most part, a bad idea... and, shy of going into a long-ass tirade about them, I think that *any* subsidies should have an ~2 year scale-in (tests   market-prep for wide-scale deployment) period, followed by a 3 year actual subsidy period... ...followed by 2-5 years of forced-votes-to-renew scale downs.

ok, so, i'll take that a little farther, but still try to contain my wall o'text on the subject.  after initial tests (universities and such) an ~2 year scale up from smaller-scale university testing overlaps that is pre- the ~2 year subsidy period... ....this is basically where farms working with universities are able to scale up from the acreage of the private-farm dedicated to the university trials is able to scale up from the, say, '50 acres' initially covered to the, say, 500-5'000 acres of the farm (if the farmer/university choose to scale up to something like that) ... ....and, just to give the industry of what*ever* is being subsidized an initial gov't assist   pre-set customer to 'get itself going' as production capacity is put in place and starts... ...so, that's the ~2 year scale-up.

then, 3 years of hardened subsidies towards it. grants, subsidies, as well tax breaks and gov't-supported loan programs with banks   such.   .... 3 years of this at 'whatever percentage' ... ...and, then, 2 more years (more +1, +1) where it's voted on to extend that '3 year period' ... but it *has* to be voted on, it can't just be 'earmarked to continue' (this is how subsidies become permanent policy!) 

and, during that +1, +1 years, *start* a phase-down in gov't support (so, instead of say a 100% tax break on capital invested, make it something like 75% the first +1 years, then 50% the second +1 year) ... then, if it's working, things are going good... ...*may*be do another '3 year scaledown' in support for it... but, again, each year it *has* to be voted on.. and a max 10-year cap of support outside of typical biz loan-support   tax breaks on capital investments.   .... so, ~2+3+1+1 ...  and, in these last 3 years, it's voted on *to* scale down... ..progressively, with a 'tapering off' in support over those 3 additional years... lower % tax breaks, less gov't-backed loans, less support for the industry itself producing whatever it is (and this can be biochar as much as oil or n.gas... and, be it equipment suppliers to drillers to equipment suppliers for purchasers ... to possibly the 'material' itself (gas, oil, whatever)) ...  the idea being that there are *no* 'permanent subsidies' (or other gov't backed financialized incentives ... tax breaks, gov't-backed loans, ... to both the developers/producers, as well the consumers) ... like has happened with oil.

A new 'technology' would be invested in to get researched, would get invested in to 'get going' (with support from subsidies, tax breaks, gov't-backed loans, etc) ... but would taper down and, either it stands on its own, or it fails... ...or it more likely lingers somewhere in the background hovering between that product/industry that's still around but no where near as 'big a deal' as it was... ...wind, solar, geothermal, etc as well shoudl be included in this.

my reasoning   rationale behind this... and, this specifically to biochar -even... despite being an obvious *huge* supporter   fan of biochar (again, just note the posting history at /r/biochar and who posts most of the stuff there... and realize that that goes well past reddit's cut off point on the history-of-posts that show up)... ....i don't think it's 'needed' longer than that.

...and, quite possibly, in the case of biochar, I don't think it's really needed *any*way.  the reason is this: the stuff, when made right and implemented correctly, more than easily pays for itself.

and *there*in lay it's real 'crux' ... ...if there could be some sort of a 'student loan' type of biz-loan.   that could be deployed with, say, an extension office... whereby the farm using the stuff can *go* to their farm-lender, their farm-friendly   knowledgeable bank, or their non-profit or other set up around this... ...get a gov't-backed -type loan, but with a 'you gotta work with the extension office for proper implementation to meet required specs' (just to both help the farmer make sure they're implementing it correctly, as well, to increase the assurances   likelihood that the whole thing will actually *work* .. as well just to provide some 'good advice' and to throw some cash the extension offices way.. i like extension offices   officers. everyone i've met seems really nice, informative, willingly-and-wantingly helpful, and enthusiastic to help anyone seeking their assistance) ... ... um, with that, say a '3 year grace period' from the time the loan is initiated to 'buy' the biochar ... with the possibility of a '2 year extension' ... so, say, for 3 years, they get a 'no-payment, no-interest accrued' loan... and, by the 4th year, they have to start making payments and the principal starts accruing interest .... ...and, say, a 5 year payback period from there or something.. ....this gives the char some time to age, the soil some time to 'normalize' if the char wasn't incorporated in such a way as to immediately *add* to the soil... ...and, the farmer a way to get the loan, get some time before having to take the hit on it, and some time for the benefits of the char to start returning to the farmer in such a way that the savings the char provides (water, fertilizes, remediation of the soil, etc) to have added up. ... in such that the farmer is really out of pocket 'nothing' that they wouldn't've been anyway ...and with much healthier soil, providing a larger yield off of less inputs.. and with less ancillary costs from run off, loss of inputs, and environmental damage to surrounding areas.  ...

the 'carbon negativity' is just an added bonus, as is the rest of the benefits of biochar really.. ...

but, I ultimately see the farms that incorporate biochar will be much like the farms that started using tractors.  Initially it was a bit cumbersome, there was a learning period as tractor tech evolved, and as infrastructure was put in place on the farm *to* support the changes the tractor provided (larger yields, faster, closer plowing, but diesel, barn to store it in, necessary maintenance costs, etc) ... but, in the end, those that incorporated the tractor may've done so out of convenience (like biochar... it just provides less work) or may've simply done so out of *necessity* ... hard to keep up with labor costs and/or other when you're out there breaking your back with a horse   plow while the guy the next farm/field over has plenty of time to sit on his tractor drinkin' a beer after a short-period plowing to watch you breakin' both you *and* your horse's back plowing the field... with the farmer sayin' to himself   his hands, 'Bob over there ain't got too many years left in 'im.. and with the savings from this here Deere, I'm gonna have enough to *easily* buy those fields at auction... or from his wife when she's hard pressed for cash and tired of nursin' ol' Bob there 'cause he can't work no more' ... read: those who don't won't be able to afford to keep up with those who do, and the subsequent dropping in prices that'll be afforded...  ...and those who do will simply buy up those who don't ... and incorporate it in.


 the only realistic way that we can do anything about the CO2 problem

making all the biochar we can make will only help slow the tide relative to what we're emitting..... the badass thing about biochar is though that it's both a carbon negative approach (and pretty much the *only* carbon negative approach out there .. ..that's realistically implementable)  *and* an energy 'source'.   making biochar makes [syngas](/r/syngas) and syngas can be either blended with [n.gas](/r/naturalgas) or straight swapped with it (think ethanol with gasoline) .... so, thus, *while* removing carbon, we'd *also* be producing energy.   ....and, if implemented correctly (read: [switchgrass](/r/switchgrass), we can do it fast, widespread, and in a pretty environmentally-friendly way (switchgrass is a native grass and provides a habitat for a *lot* of the natural wildlife that was there... ...vs corn.  and its growth cycle pretty much coincides *with* the local wildlife of the ares... meaning, while it's growing it's providing food, protection, ...habitat .. and when it's harvested (using standard hay bailing equipment) ... is when the wildlife are usually moved on (birds) or old enough to fend for themselves (spring-babies become fall 'adults') or go into hibernation and such anyway.

switchgrass also has an EROEI of about 10x that of corn... so, 1/10th the land, or 10x the energy off the same amount of land.. ...and, it's broadcast seeded and can grow on land you would *never* think to take a plow to, let a*lone* plant corn/soy on.  ...and, [switchgrass](http://goo.gl/7EzI4c) is one helluva [soil](soil) builder in   of its [own right](http://goo.gl/yZDhw8) ... which holds a ton of carbon in   of itself... and pulls a ton of carbon *out* in   of itself.   ... plus it can be used to provide pulp for paper making, building, etc (if you don't make char out of it).  I like hemp, don't get me wrong, and help oil is a great long-chain hydrocarbon (where switchgrass is more ethane-down-to-hydrogen) ... but, it doesn't really compare nor compete against switchgrass, imo. and i'm a pretty big fan of hemp.

 Cool. Hopefully it serves as a deterrent against Israeli surprise bombings of their nuclear sites.

World powers (namely the US) can 'easily' navigate through this, counter it, and otherwise overwhelm it ... if need be, but Israel would likely have a more difficult time, would take more of a hit, and would less likely to recover quickly enough should Iran choose to retaliate quickly.

'Those kids' need to cool their saber rattling   war mongering b.s. ...and these are an advanced enough system *to* keep it at just that: saber rattling rhetoric vs actual escalation to all out war.

  Your posted link had zero information about estimated evaporation losses due to turfgrass irrigation.

that's because I honestly care very little about the evaporative losses due to turfgrass irrigation. It's just one of a vast multitude of areas that evaporative losses from irrigation is an issue.   that you'd even single it out is 'weird' in   of itself.   ...that you'd single it out and *then* mention it while providing no link relative to it? a complete waste of time   space.

it's essentially useless to've even mentioned it to be honest with you. 

 I apparently tried harder than you did

and yet found nor provided *nothing*.   and, at that, maybe you found nothing because no one cares enough to focus on it on that semantic enough of a level to leave out the 'countless' other areas 'evaporative losses due to irrigation' can *also* apply.   again, just reinforcing the asininity of even bringing it up to begin with ... let alone complete lack of providing a link relating to it.

douchebag? really? 1) I'm pretty sure that such things are against the rules of 'proper reddiquette'  and 2) douchebag is the person who responds to a needlessly stupid subject (brought up by someone who then provides no link *after* bringing it up) with a link at least *some*what relating to said stupid subject matter .

may want to look in the mirror there, buddy.

 I live on clay soils

congrats. many people do ... and I'd imagine you would.. as i'd imagine they'll continue to remain that way from the level of foresight I've seen you provide up to this point on how to avoid them, as well, level of knowledge required on how to reduce or dilute them by working   building SOC   SOM into them.

 don't lecture me about them

frankly? I'll say whatever the hell I want to to someone who's reduced our dialogue to name calling and complete idiocy. 

 You assume if the soil holds 25% more water, then you'll need 25% less water to do the same watering?

no. I don't assume that. 

 I have no idea where to start

that you even realize there's something there from which *to* start a response is an amazement to me at this point.

 Thats honestly how you retards come up with your success numbers isn't it?

again, that reddiquette thing. 

 the only savings will be from decreased evaporation

yet, evaporation is still a variable, right? otherwise, why would you have even brought it up in your *last* message?

 blah blah blah

and my response to it: all of that is 'blah blah blah' at this point. not even worth acknowledging that you flapped your mouth some more

 This is science, and once good university science catched up with your biochar crap, you'll disappear too.

there's plenty of 'good university science'  published in a multitude of papers both supporting *and* detracting from the 'buzz' around biochar. You *could* try linking to some of the detracting ones to reinforce your 'blah blah blah' above and you wouldn't look like such an idiot. ...but, at this point, I'd imagine someone like you has gotten *so* used to looking like one that you'd really have no idea how to handle *not*.  so, it doesn't surprise me that you *don't* find some of the 'good university science' backing up your sentiments.  trust me, they're out there... there're plenty posted by me to /r/biochar. 

 you'll disappear too

unlikely



lol  did you really say 'this is science'???
you're a fucking idiot. seriously. a. fucking. idiot. that you just considered your opinion to be science.

and you call *me* a douchebag! ha! 

edit: and, frankly, at this point, me even wasting my time responding to you make me one too 




  it may come down to them actually running out of water

do you realize how much the land all those farms is sitting on??? 

LA used to be farms. look at it now. 

Rage Against the Machine has that line in [one of their songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFCiIkDv-sM), 'kill them off, take their land, and go there for vacation'

or, more, kill off the farms, buy up their land at auction on the courthouse steps, develop it, sell it, and use the money to buy a vacation home somewhere.

Truthfully, I'd imagine that it'd be difficult even for the '*responsible*' farmer in California to make it in this climate (both environmental   economic).  .... maybe not bankruptcy or default-level but, there's a lot of pressure right now. 'survival of the fittest' is definitely in play there ... be the fittest sound practices, or politically connected... or just strategically placed (grandfathered water rights, etc).

I've met more than a few people who've swooped in to buy property for 'pennies on the dollar' once the crunch has come in. I, myself, have done it in fact. It's a bit of a scum-bucket thing to do but... not at the same time, it just depends on how it's handled.

My grandfather managed a farm here for 40+ years. The initial farm was ~3500 acres, but after WWII, between the soldiers that didn't return to the ones that did to a climate they couldn't adapt to (ptsd played its part in this, i'm sure) to 'whatever' other reasons, the owner of the farm started coming in and buying up farms from farmers that were going into default.

Each had their own deal but, all in all, the acreage 'brokered' was something like 15k... many were able to work the land and pay it back, others couldn't but were 'hired on' to continue working their own land, others turned and walked away. It was spread across dozens to possibly a few hundred farms overall... all in the same small county... 

but, up to about '55-'60, it *finally* started to work its way through... and the '~3'500 acre' original farm had settled on something like 5'500 acres, the other ~10'000+ acres having been... most of it's just real estate/houses schools, small stores, offices etc... such as the past 50 years of suburban creep is about, but... well, the 5'500 acres? it'll prob be that for *quite* some time as the family my grandfather was working for made *quite* a bit of money during that period of time...

I can't watch what's going on in California and *not* think about 'Chinatown' ... i know that's way too over simplistic and kinda-sorta a 'pop b.s.' way to look at it, but... ...watch how it plays out over the next 5-15 years, let alone 25-50 years. Chinatown was released in '74, but set in '37... so, ~40 years between the two.. and, well, from the release date, ~ another 40 years... ....so, just noting the development that happened from the 'mid-30's' to the 'mid-'70s'   ... and then the 'mid-70s' to today... ... divides the time down into two 'pretty clean chunks'.

in '40 years time', I imagine California will look... much like the last 40 years of 'progress' has looked like.   ...desal plants probably playing a huge part of that.  ...esp with [materials](/r/materials) like [graphene](/r/graphene) starting to become available and providing 'perfect' [water filtration](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=11561).

 I think it will get to the point where they quite simply won't be able to afford not to.

meaning, their cost for doing business will be so high vs the competition that they simply won't be able to afford to do business any more.

Sure the state can do bailouts, grants, etc to make it more cost-effective   profitable for the business owners, but even *that* will weigh down the state to the point that, at some point, people start revolting... and in such a way that even that breaks down

...and, usually at the expense of the citizens (unfortunately).  I mean, how many people in california would be effected if, say, Nestle shuts its doors to that bottling facility?

and, not just the direct jobs themselves, but the ancillary ones... insurance agents, servers/waiters, bar tenders, mechanics, etc. 

and with legalization around the corner, even drug dealers woudl have a hard time staying in business.

I'm not arguing to keep nestle open, i'm saying that the entire practice is unaffordable, unsustainable, and breaking down.

desal can certainly provide the raw materials (solar, waves, wind, geothermal, etc can provide the energy needed for heat... desalination, reverse osmosis, etc... )  but at what cost? and, more so... why do that that way only to continue to waste it due to inefficiency on the back end?

25%+ of the water that goes to the ag industry in california is lost due to irrigative evaporation. 

promote various methods that change irrigation practices, punish those who don't, and right off the bat there'll be more savings to justify *not* building so many desal plants.

california doesn't 'need' desal. it needs a change in infrastructural   managerial approach 




 ...or they could just add [biochar](/r/biochar) to their [soils](/r/soil), change their [agricultural](/r/agriculture) practices to actually *build* soil and *retain* [water](/r/water), vs wasting it on inefficient and high-loss [irrigation](/r/Irrigation) or bottling it up and exporting it via nestle and other.

with that, they could also tie the ['waste'](/r/waste) heat from their power plants into a [wastewater](/r/wastewater) distillation process that allows for it to be near-perpetually recycled back into the market for reuse. 

California's biggest problem is that they run an ag industry that their environment can't support, in a way that is horribly inefficient and makes it all the *less* sustainable... while horridly underutilizing their infrastructure to properly balance their demands.

but, still neat math. ...and, honestly, seems totally doable.  




  breed the gluten out of wheat

'breeding' it out is one thing.  like, if they 'gmo'd' one to use as a base to know what genes they'd need to exist... and not... and then did controlled 'breeding' of natural strains along the lines necessary to attain that geneset? fine. great even.

but, well, to insert genes into it... and then to plant those far   wide.. is just taking the whole GMO thing one step farther, and one step more-clouded in 'this is a good idea' stupidity.

my follow up to that (wrote that after reading your first paragraph... before reading your second).... was going to be, 'ultimately, 'who cares?' ... when you can just get gluten-free now?

better efforts would seemingly be spent on widening the availability of products on the market that are al*ready* gluten free....
they're out there, but they pale in comparison to the gluten-'rich' products out there.

but, i like science? so... kudos for *that*?
