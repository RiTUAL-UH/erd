 It's based on web browsing stats, so probably not. 




 Can't someone just put a bullet in Teddy already? The man is just too stupid to live. 




 Papazian appeared, disguised as a human being. He checked quickly to make sure that his head was on right. "Nose and toes the same way goes," he reminded himself, and that was how it was.

All of his systems were go. His psyche was soldered firmly to his pineal gland, and he even had a small soul powered by flashlight batteries. 









 I have a couple of XP machines left, but nothing I use for anything vital. 

At work they won't let any machine running XP connect to the network at all, not even the guest WiFi. 









 Generally, if you do any work (paid or unpaid) while you are on unemployment you must report that and your unemployment payments will be reduced. In New York it's 1/4 off your weekly check for any day you work, no matter how much time during the day you spend working.

Not to mention that, under the FLSA, any work you do for an employer must be paid. You can not work for free.

On the other hand, you could turn this into a networking opportunity and use your old work e-mail address to ask your old clients if they have any positions open.

Really, this just sounds like a bad idea all around. 




 And I think that's part of the problem. If you have a combined universe you're going to want to save the best characters for the movies and the TV universe becomes a second class operation with the left over characters.  




 More to the point, AOS spent a lot of season one spinning its wheels while waiting for Winter Soldier to hit the theater.  




 Go watch the episodes of Agents of SHIELD that aired prior to Winter Soldier and you have your answer.

Trying to connect the two universes would hamstring one or the other or both. Having them separate lets each universe do the types of stories that suit their medium without having to worry about continuity with the other.  









 Seriously. Asians make up 4.8% of the US population. African Americans are 13.1%. Asians make up 14.5% of the shows viewership while African Americans make up 14.9%.

 I'm still waiting for the Manimal reboot. 




 That's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off them.

 Who are you inspecting them for? What exactly are you inspecting?

Also, how do you introduce yourself now? 




 The IRS has a whistleblower line and you can earn a cash award if they recover enough money.

Bottom line, your employer is a thief. He's stealing tips from you and he's cheating the government out of taxes he should be paying.  




 You're working part-time for $12/hr and no benefits and you're asking if you should be looking for another job?

Yes...the answer is yes.

Sure, maybe your current gig will turn into something good somewhere down the line, but there's no guarantee. So work hard and in your spare time look for something better.  




 What if you have Windows XP? 

I have a couple old laptops I'd like to continue using as spares/junkers. Be nice to see if Win10 can run on them. 









 Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter. 




 I don't know how he can say the people on The Americans aren't good or bad. The Jennings are clearly bad people. 

Elizabeth is a stone-cold, remorseless killer. She crushed an innocent man's skull by dropping a car on it so that her asset could get his job at the Northrop plant.  




 Pushy and high pressure at this stage is generally bad. It's a big red flag.

Why can't they wait? If they're so desperate, what will they do if you turn them down? Do they have a second candidate in the wings?

You're in a good situation now. It doesn't pay to jump unless you've got an offer that's clearly better. Push off company 2. Take the interview at company 3 and weigh your options.  




 I'm not opposed to movies that are sad or have a sad ending per se, I'm just not very interested in movies where that seems to be the whole point. 

This is a somewhat trite example, but I have no interest in seeing Marley and Me either.

And the fact that it's a gay romance doesn't really have any bearing on my lack of desire to see it. If it were a hetero romance, I'd probably be even less motivated to watch it. 




 Brokeback Mountain.

Every time my wife talks about it she tells me how wonderful and sad it is. I'm not really into being sad. 




 This was the first thing that came to mind. 




 I'm gonna barbeque your ass in molasses!

Put the evidence in the car! 




 I'd leave myself a note to bug my mom to get yearly mammograms once she hits 50.

 My experience with Kirby was 28 years ago, so take this with a that caveat.

When I was hired as Kirby salesman, I was promised a small base salary with commissions. I never received any salary and  I'm pretty sure they didn't pay me all the commission owed when I quit. I sold four units in the six weeks I worked there and was paid a total of $300 plus some gas money.

The units are very expensive. It was over $900 when I was selling them back in 1986. I hear they're close to $3000 now. That's a huge ask for a dirt sucker. You can get a top of the line Dyson for 20% of that. 

When I was hired, I was promised training and guidance for the first four weeks as I shadowed an experienced salesman. I went out on my own after being with the company for two days. 

There are people who make a lot of money selling these things. And, in all fairness, the lessons I learned going into people's houses and pitching a $900 vacuum cleaner two or three times a day for those six weeks have served me well in my various jobs since then. 




 Can't say that I was too excited about this. By the end, the show had become a sad parody of itself, but it is nice to see the guys back together. 




 Why are you concerned about what's legal or not? Why would anyone take a job like that? Why would you work for a company that would offer a job like that? It's insane.

Figuring a three hundred mile distance (five hours at 60MPH) between both cities, you'd be spending over a $100 a week in gas alone, assuming you have a decent car and gas prices don't go back up. You'd put over 75k miles on your car in the span of a year.

Seems to me that somebody at this company is trying to cheap out, hiring one engineer to fill in at both locations instead of hiring one for each. 
 









 Yeah, I'm pretty sure that modifying your hourly pay on a week-to-week basis based on how many hours you work so that your weekly pay remains the same is not in any way legal.  




 Song Of The Sea. Every scene is a moving piece of art. 




 RIP Robin. Thanks for everything. 

Hope you're enjoying the next part of the journey. 




 I just don't get people who get all wound up over remakes. 

It's not like they're recording over the original film The old one is still there. You can watch it whenever you like. 









 They will if we give it enough upvotes. 




 What's the point of solar in space?  I get that you can get power 24/7 instead of worrying about day/night cycles and weather here on Earth plus you get better efficiency , but isn't  going to be cheaper to just build more solar panels and some kind of energy storage here on the ground than launch a huge solar power station out of the gravity well and then maintain it in orbit? 




 I recently binged the entire series and I think it holds up pretty well.

There's a lot of meh in seasons 1 and 2, but I think you can say that about any of the Star Trek series. Once you get to season 3 things are really clicking and season 4 was very enjoyable.

I bailed out the first time around after season 2. In retrospect, I should have kept with it.

The finale was terrible, though.  




 Nicely done. 




 Yes, some eBay sellers have helpfully posted the MEIDs on their listings. None I've checked have passed the check.

I wonder if we should see about filing a formal complaint with the FCC. Sprint's actions certainly violate the spirit of the new CTIA Consumer Code. 




 Stormy Monday 




 Before the the whole FEC thing came down, my plan was to pick up a used LG G2 on eBay, once that model became available for transfer, and retire my old Galaxy S2, which has given me good service, but is getting a bit long in the tooth.

Then I figured I'd wait a bit after the new year, figuring there would be a lot of used phones for sale after people got their new shiny for X-Mas. Well, that was a mistake.

So, what to do now? Is there some resolution for this in the pipeline? As far as I can tell, my only decent option now is to wait or buy a new device from Ting.  

I really don't want to switch to GSM. My workplace has Sprint repeaters and I get excellent service. 




 I have a fairly modern tablet (Sony Xperia Z) and a big town (level 50) and the Tapped Out app crashes several times a day. Some times I can't even restart it unless I force stop it and clear the cache.

It's pretty annoying. Anyone else have similar issues? 




 Carpe Diem 




 Song Of The Sea. 

What a lush and beautiful film. Every scene in the movie was like a painting and the story was sad and haunting. A little too sad for my six year-old, who likes her films to be more upbeat.

 I saw it today at the Cinema Arts Centre in Huntington and the place was sold out. Makes me wonder why it didn't get a wider release. 




 I think I actually used to know that. Gotta love the Golden Age. 




 Pretty sure you mean heavy water, mister bot. Heavy water is  a form of water that contains a larger than normal amount of the radioactive hydrogen isotope deuterium.

Hard water just has a lot of minerals in it. 




 Nothing wrong with that. It's kinda how watching Justified is like watching Deadwood.  




 I laughed at this, but I felt bad about it. 




 I would so watch this. 









 I love the old-timey football pics, not to mention the fact that the NFL invented Arena Football in 1932, 




 Casino gambling almost never brings anywhere near the promised benefits. AC has had gambling for decades and it hasn't had much of a positive impact. 









 The event runs until at least 3/24. I assume they don't want people to get all the items right away and then get bored with it. 




 In science it often happens that scientists say, 'You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken,' and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion.

 My id is test_subject96, same as my Reddit ID.

I'm level 49, have a lot of cool stuff and play multiple time a day. 




 I watch it with my six year-old daughter. The days following a new episode are filled with GF rewatching on a constant loop until my wife gets sick of it. 




 And Orphan Black. 

I may as well tell my boss I won't be coming in to work in April as I'll be on a TV holiday. 




 Looks to me like your boss was looking for an excuse to fire you because you were on FMLA. I'd speak with an employment lawyer ASAP. 




 After watching that, I typed Naked Ladies into Google, just out of curiosity. First result is three year old post on imgur linked from reddit. 




 The Last Starfighter

Flash Gordon (1980)

If you want to expand his horizons a bit, try Forbidden Planet 




 Unless you signed something preventing it, you are free to speak about the work you did, especially in private during an interview.

Verbal directives from the partners mean nothing. 














 I loved it when it was on, but back in the 80's there was a real shortage of SF/Fantasy/Genre shows so we  tended to latch on to whatever they deigned to show us. I loved the 80's Buck Rogers show, which has little to recommend it these days except Erin Gray in skin-tight spandex outfits.

GAH is a show very much of its time. It has problems common to superhero shows of that period including a lack of super villains and terrible VFX.

I'd give it a few episodes if you're interested.   




 Someone needs to explain to me why these parents aren't in prison for child abuse. 




 I could see them doing a Greatest American Hero deal to keep his power in check. He gets the ring, but has no idea how to use it. 




 As high as necessary to make the job worthwhile for you.

The only thing I'd say is not to get ahead of yourself. You don't know what their offer will be or even if you'll get one. Wait until you have the  numbers, then decide. 




 Which is why he covered his face when he saw the network closet was under video surveillance. And why he ran from security when they came to speak with him.  




 Well said. I'm going to copy and save this so I can paste it in whenever this topic comes up. 




 MIT reportedly wanted him to serve some jail time as deterrent to someone else abusing their open computer resources to make a political point. 




 If he thought what he was doing was legal, then he should have gone to court and argued the point.

It's clear that he knew what he was doing was illegal because, instead of downloading the JSTOR files from his desk at Harvard, he went to MIT and abused their open computer resources to make his political point. 

In the process, he created no end of headaches for the network admins at MIT as well as students, faculty and researchers who had their access to JSTOR curtailed while Swartz evaded their attempts to kick him off their network.  




 Line cook is not a position that's eligible for exempt (salary with no OT paid) pay.

What was your weekly paycheck? 




 I think they ran out of money. They did most/all of the interviews, but they don't have money/time to finish it up.

The blu rays for sale on their site are pre-orders, just FYI. 




 You handle it like you'd handle any other job where you had a falling out with your boss. Be honest about having difficulties with your supervisor without getting too specific about the gory details. Explain that, due to your interpersonal issues, you don't expect to get a good reference from them. 

If you can, you find someone, a co-worker or client, that you worked with who can give you an alternate reference for that job.

Since it was a family business, you can calmly explain without getting into to much detail, that you had a falling out with with your parent in part because you make a clean break and strike out on your own.

Best of luck to you. 




 That's neat. I didn't realize that Gotham and Rome shared the same creator. Gotham certainly has its issues, but I'm enjoying it overall and given how great Rome was, it gives me some hope for the future of Gotham.

Interestingly enough, I saw the parallels between Gotham's Bruce Wayne and Rome's Octavian right from the beginning. Gotham may run into the same issue that Rome did if they decide to time jump and replace David Mazouz.

 




 Seems like a good lineup, although I'm not a big fan of any iteration of Hawk and Dove.

Disappointing not to see Cyborg and Beast Boy in the lineup, but making either of those characters look halfway decent on a TNT budget is probably nigh impossible.

Not that this was ever going to happen anyway, but I guess that ends any possibility of another Birds of Prey TV show.  




 What did your boss say when you told him how much the recruiter was taking? 

If I were you, I'd go back to the recruiter and tell them you want a 30% bump effective immediately or you're going to start looking for new work and you're going to tell the client exactly why. I doubt they want to queer the relationship with such a valuable client.
