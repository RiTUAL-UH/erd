 Also try not to just row one side.  









 So far we've done two 30' tests and I did worse on the second one, which is why this whole debate started. Since then I've been training with higher splits to keep my heart rate in the right zone (until the end of a piece every now and then). We have our next test tomorrow, so hopefully this will all pay off and I'll be okay.

And I don't feel like I'm killing myself at 170+ but I also don't feel like I know enough about hr zones to say that I'm okay there, because it is tiring but not that tiring. I've only been rowing for 2+ years and I've only been paying attention to my hr for the past six months. I will definitely discuss more with my coaches. Thank you so much! 




 We use our split from a 30' test +7 for SS. Most people on my team seem to be keeping their hr between 160-165 but mine is 170+. So I've been doing SS at 30'T +9 or 10. It sucks for team SS workouts because people with slower 2ks than me are finishing distance pieces minutes before me. Sometimes I get too competitive and end up pulling too hard and getting my hr above the target zone. My coaches scold me for this because they like lower hrs for SS. But I'm glad you guys are saying it isn't terrible for my hr to be a little higher because my coaches made it seem like a Very Bad Thing.
