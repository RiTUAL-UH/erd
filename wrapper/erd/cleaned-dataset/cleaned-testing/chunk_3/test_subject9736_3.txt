 Check the education data layer to see where the uneducated (ie. the purple "kids") are in your city, might indicate a traffic problem.

Like heterodoxz says, close down the other schools and leave only the university so it can be upgraded and you can build more school add-ons.

I've done the university only thing for an extended period of time, but it's a drag on traffic especially if you've only got one uni serving the whole city (but two or more unis take up so much room, especially with all the upgrades). Having a high school (or two, placed strategically), and a university in a good location traffic wise works better for me (note this wasn't for an education city, just your typical electronics one).

I find that it's best not to have too many extra desks, as that might invite out of town students, unless that's what you want. Out of town students can clog up your city entrances and routes to the schools in the morning, and might even force your own city's students to miss out on an education in the process. 




 Produce alloy with the recycling center and sell it to the global market at the trade port/depot, very easy way to make a lot of money quickly.

Alternatively, you can create a new city in the region whose sole purpose is to pick up trash for your main city, once you gift the new city some cash at the start. It saves you from having to waste precious room building garbage/recycling centers in your main city.

On the positive side, one of those trucks will have come from a dimension where the traffic agent actually works. 




 Probably just temporary server problems, if it is indeed the right server (saves are localized to each server).

Others were having this problem prior to 2.0, I think you just had to do the tutorial, and then your cities will be there again. 




 Heh, thanks!

As for the llama problem, perhaps a llama map layer might help to identify the source of all these llama infestations.
