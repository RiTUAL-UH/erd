 Sonicare...hands-down.

 YIKES! 




 yet another great discovery for me from Hell's Headbangers :"Probably one of the most wanted old school death/thrash albums of the 90s. Originally released by Euronymous' label Deathlike Silence, 'The Awakening' is a slab of unholy metal violence brought back to life by Osmose Productions, and featuring bonus tracks from the legendary Uppsala gig. Here's your chance to grab a piece of underground history before it disappears into the dark again..." 









 MANIMAL! 




 finally tried it and had explosive diarrhea for 3 days...

 I must say, I avoided it for years thinking it a hipster-haven, but a buddy recently came down from Portland and took me there for a Pliny, and I'm totally sold - refilling my growler whenever I can. 




 I always picture Jim Carrey dancing to this song when I hear it. 




 just a bummer - that trail is beautiful once you get past downtown... 









 Tom Waits
 




 I see kids in full battle garb and foam swords at Rincon Valley Community park all the time

You are now an official backer of BurtoNZ bakery. Time to tell the world about it! 




 KROKUS! 




 funny, I haven't been in years but it's one of the first places I though of as well.  Do they still do their jug-wine on Sundays? 




 kept me up too - had to close the window....was right behind our house from like 2:30 - 4:00 or so... 




 wow. 




 I love that trail/bike path! 




 $8.99 lunch buffet? 




 totally amazing - I'm usually broken for the rest of the day after a lunch buffet there simply because I cannot stop! 




 thanks all - bummer, I had high hopes for an amazing meat-fest! 









 I was in the middle of the forest in Napa State Park and saw the flashes - crazy! 




 I was camping in a yurt at Napa State Park...it was absolutely insane...truly awesome in the literal sense of the word.  I too saw what appeared to be lightning - weird!  




 Bruce Campbell at the end of Darkman. 




 random, weird, and cool. 




 pan-fried padron peppers w/ sea salt and good olive oil.
