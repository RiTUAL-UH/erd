 Wait til Wrestlemania 




 I'd pay to see him in this gimmick vs Zayn 




 1 - Board with PLX chip

2 - X99 chipset with a processor that supports 40 lanes 




 I doubt it. Even if in theory it would work, AMD and NVIDIA might disable it in their driver settings.  




 Jokes on them. I haven't even finished GTA II, III and IV 




 I honestly think it was actually a segment meant to get Reigns over, but Heyman, being Heyman, well maybe he feels that he would give his 2 cents, in a non direct kind of way

I do honestly feel he was being sarcastic. When he went to the ring, he looks visibly scared of DBry, but he was not so of Reigns. Why would you be scared of a guy that had lost to the person that you're going to meet?  









 is it just me or Heyman is actually burying Reigns now? 




 I really was neutral about this match, until I realised that
*Gasp* It will be Brock vs Goldberg at WM XX all over again. 

Only this time there would be no Stone Cold to make it fun

 I forgot where I read it but someone tweeted that Rosberg has a problem in his shoulder as well, hence why he's not driving 









 Is that actually a Rouge costume she's wearing? Looks cool 




 F1LT used Formula1.com's own live timing and only parsed the data. It was due to F1LT that Formula1.com forced people to use the phone app timing instead 




 i paid for it, and it's one of the best "sport" subscription service out there. 

Note that it's not even "officially" supported in my country, and I have to use a proxy to connect, and yet it's smooth, adapts quickly according to your internet speed and the layout is easy to understand.

 The only legit move that WWE banned was the piledriver, and they only let Kane and Undertaker and even then, only at special events like Wrestlemania due to what happened to Stone Cold (altho the move was not initially banned after the incident as it was used by Mick Foley/Mankind)

 RM50 for the hillside tickets is still the cheapest F1 ticket for the season I think 









 Visibility as well as using your phone to listen to the trackside commentary. The track has their own commentators which is broadcasted over FM. Just need to tune in to the right channel 

 




 I don't remember if turn 15 itself has a screen, but if you see my pic the screen I was telling you can be  seen near the placing tower near turn 9 




 Malaysian here. I usually sit at the back straight. You can see most of the track, starting from turn 9 hairpin, up to the last hairpin.

You might be impeded a bit for turn 14, but mostly it's the best view of the circuit. If you can, sit near turn 15. There is a large TV there as well

 I only knew that the rear view was not sebring because Sebring has no elevations. Have no idea that's mid ohio so thanks. 

Forza taught me to recognise road america tho 




 The only thing on my mind was "Man Sebring looks like it needs a spruce up" 














 Thanks for pointing that out

 I read somewhere that Hamilton learnt French so that he could communicate better with his ART mechanics during his GP2 year 




 I don't think that's true. The only thing they told their customer teams were not to use a higher engine power mapping (than what the works team are using) if they are in fight with the works team. It was in one of Ted's feature in Bahrain when they were talking to Smedley. 

Officially it's to stop both team to one up each other in term of the engine power in a race, which could lead both engine to retire prematurely (the ICE need to last 4 races) 




 FI also uses Mercedes gearbox. Hence they had the same gear ratio with Mercedes throughout the year (the long 7th gear that did not go into 8th unlike all the other teams) 




 It started in the 90s I think, when a driver has to nominate which tyres they would use in the race. The tyre manufacturer will bring two compounds, a prime (which would be the safe tyre) or the option (a softer tyre that would be faster but won't last as long). 

Once you made the decision, you will be stuck with it for the whole of the race. As you can see at this moment in history, there is no reason for tyre mismatch, as you're stuck with one compound of tyres!

The Option + Prime combo usage was decided by Bernie to spice up racing, as seen from it's highly effective use in America's CART series. A lot of people have asked if they can mix and match the tyre compound, as every year you would hear Martin Brundle mention it at least twice. But the FIA had shot down the idea quickly as it would be "confusing to the viewers".

Note that not only you can't mix the tyre compounds, but you also can't switch which tyre side. For example you can't switch a left front tyre to a front right tyre. Juan Pablo Montoya's McLaren had it's front tyre mistakenly switch around, and in the race he complained that the car felt like it had a puncture.

 Is it just me, or the VodkaO Mercedes that went in the wall just now is using the Petronas Syntium livery, but without any Petronas brandings?

 The worst thing is that when you unscrew it, it will actually unscrew the metal connector that it's screwed into, instead of just the vga head. Then you have to unscrew that metal connector, and screw it back in wherever it comes from in the first place 




 Not really, more likely Sauber. Ferrari looks genuinely quick. Might not be as quick as the Merc, but looking better than last year.  




 For Malaysians, you can also watch it in selected theaters (as with Japan), but for one day only

 Nobody is going to mention the air restrictor joke?

the old Toyota WRC project (under Jean Todt) were banned for 12 months due to illegal air restrictor 




 Hungary? He could as well won if not for the engine problem at the end when he tried to pass Nando 




 Stars and stripes 




 I think this is just a testing livery, and not the real one 




 Didn't they used that colour so that it would look red in TV?  









 Ferrari would get a good ol' laugh, as McLaren would basically be promoting it's hidden sponsor, without even having to pay anything 




 They cater to casual or first time Formula one fans. And mostly the good writers are usually from Autosport. Most of the ex drivers or the one inside the business are good pundits, or opinion givers, but they are not writers. It's a different thing talking compared to writing an article piece. 

I do still read the magazine tho, because sometimes there might be hidden gems, really good articles that you did not expect to read. But those are rare and few.

 I know. I've tested most Z97 boards, including ASUS too

 Throwing in my experience. Bought some "AA grade" jerseys as well, but most of my collections are original, usually bought during promo or clearance. 

Usually they will feel the same when you touch it, but most of the fake jersey seems to retain your sweat on your body, and makes you itchy and wet after a while.  




 If you're using a server, yes. But unless your OS is optimised for it (read: Linux server for multithreading) it's worthless 




 Depends on the chipset. Only LGA2011's X79 and X99 chipset supports for quad channel RAM, hence the 8 RAM slots. You won't usually see normal consumer use this, as these are targeted for really hardcore gamers/overclockers, and cost a bomb

If you're sticking to the Intel Z97/Z87 based boards, you won't get more than 4 RAM slots as the processor only supports dual channel RAM 




 No, but if you're an overclocker, those extra capacitors and MOSFETS on the larger board leads to better and much more stable overclocking. Hence why you don't see overclockers use mini ITX boards

 His family runs a simulator centre that uses rFactor. he was asking in the rFactor forum at the time

 Went there twice. It's one of the most pleasant smelling place I've went

It's in Madinah, a different city from Mekah.  




 That, and also the rule stated the wings can't be more than 110cm that year IIRC 




 Yes. Also due to logistic reason, it's easy to go to Malaysia from Australia. 
Singapore could in theory swap place with Malaysia, making it Australia - singapore - Bahrain, but that would mean putting Singapore in the rainy season, and they don't want this to happen.

besides, a dry Malaysia is miles better than a dry Singapore, what's more a wet Sepang? 









 Formula E also uses rFactor for their simulators whenever they have a race. the mod is built by an Australian modding team with inputs by the team. talked to them back when Formula E was had a race in Putrajaya 




 Wut? 









 Teal color is Petronas, which is always on each team they sponsor, except for BMW. So it WILL be present 




 Yes, till 7th 









 Best lines from the interview

Yamaga: The first thing that Anno said when I first met him was "Do you watch Gundam?"

Yamaga: Most of the stuffs in the drama (Aoi Honoo) is just fiction, but most do happen, like when Anno and Akai fought like Ultraman in the public bath

 2005 Italian Grand Prix by Raikkonen. He was one stopping in the race, and was carrying a LOT more fuel than anybody else, and yet he was fastest 




 Nobody mentioned Brazil 2008? 




 I love how they spliced the good looking 3D render, even tho the simulator itself is running rFactor Pro, which only runs DX9 




 Kelate. Tapi ni masa 2009 




 Because not all places can be found on the internet, especially a small village in Malaysia?

 I don't think so for drift cats. I think there are high cuts for Superlight tho

http://i.imgur.com/pHSsnRl.jpg

Some of my Puma shoes. My drift cats are in the car since it's for driving only. The high cut ones are Kart Racing, the red and black is Ferrari Superlight and the white is casual Mini. I also have an all black Mercedes that I wear for meeting 




 The advantage in Abu Dhabi was not only due to the car alone, but because Perez has really old tyres compared to both Hamilton and Rosberg

 last game I played was Far Cry 3. After that uplay keeps frustrating me and I never bought another game from Ubisoft again

It''s different from Origin. EA actually made it better (my only bad experience was when my account was hacked, but I got my games back using their oh so slow customer support). Uplay does not seem to fix their issues as fast as Origin or Steam has

You can't really compare

 Really old engine?

 The show does not take itself seriously. It parodies every cliche and trope of super sentai and kamen rider and anime, which makes it a good watch 









 something about NTSC vs PAL 









 I actually prefer 25FPS if it's a movie or video due to easier encoding. Hence most of my games are recorded at that rate. But playing the games itself, nothing beats high FPS.

Tested with my game. It actually IS 60FPS and is goddamn smooth. Thank you jewtube 




 By the end of the day most of the guys that uses SteamOS turned back to Windows so I expect teh dual boot feature won't be important after 2 to 3 weeks 




 depends. Post processing are just that. Addon filters that are added to give fake effects. It's not even realistic and just there to make it look cool and stuffs. Hence why there is an option to turn it off.  




 Ever been playing in a competitive online racing game? You want all the advantages you can get. Who cares about realism 




 I was watching the race. It's good for tin top. But for open wheels? Dangerous 




 That's why I turn off post processing
