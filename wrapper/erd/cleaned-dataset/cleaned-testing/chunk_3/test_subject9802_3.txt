 "Well, shit..." 




 Clownfish can change their gender 




 Cat. 




 I've done that and I'm still waiting for a service like this to exist 




 "I already donate"
"No thank you"
"I already own it" 




 Last night:

"You look really beautiful right now.... For some reason" *confused face*

Said by my drunk coworker who is a "secret softie" hardass chick 




 I'm an American and I eat all of those things!

 Aww, this made me tear up. I miss my Nana :') 




 Brilliant. This one is my favorite. 




 Fantastic! Thanks so much for giving me 3 options for them, that's exactly what I needed :) 




 Bullet is a solid rye, even if r/whiskey has differing opinions, you can't "disagree" with someone's palate. This is helpful for that reason especially! 




 This is in Boston. Everything is expensive and nothing makes sense.  




 This is in Boston. Everything is expensive here :/ 




 Awesome, thank you! High west campfire is great. Rye is my favorite of the spirits so this is really awesome advice, thanks! 




 Thanks a bunch! This is good information :) 




 Haha this is a fantastic response. You hit the nail on the head with your assessment. I always prefer rye for my manhattans and scotch to sip. I'll have to think of a few more options because I'm not fond of very "sweet" whiskeys so I appreciate the direction to focus on :D 




 Thank you so much! This is incredibly helpful! I've tried quite a few, but honestly ony can remember about one or two from most categories as I wasn't drinking them with the intention of selling it, heh. I really appreciate the feedback and will keep it in mind until I have my own go-to's as ammunition :) 




 Hey all!

I just got a new job as a cocktail waitress at a bar specializing in whiskey/whisky... A lot of patrons will ask for suggestions on recommendations for a good bourbon/scotch/rye of varying conditions/batches/etc.

I was curious what r/whiskey thought about some solid go-to's and why.

[Here is the full spirits list for anyone curious.](http://www.saloondavis.com/documents/Saloon_Bourbon8.9.13.pdf) It changes often, so anything outside of this is encouraged, too, but try to stick to the list if you can :)

Thanks! 




 A lot of people seem to think they're crows, but they are actually starlings! The collective noun for starlings is called a murmuration. [Check out this really awesome video of them in a flock!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRNqhi2ka9k) 




 A murmuration of starlings, actually! :) 




 murmuration, actually! Those are starlings :) 




 Those are starlings, so it would be a murmuration :D 




 Adobe Flash and the CS5 suite. I like flash for sketching because it is smooth and I can save the drawings in various sizes :) 




 Awesome! My aunt who lives in Australia gave it to me as a kid. I loved that book! 




 [I kind of already did that, as a cheeta clam king!](http://i.imgur.com/caa4rjf.png) 




 Thank you so much! That is incredibly helpful! 




 My pleasure! :D 




 OH GOD if it wasn't an insect I would. Meep! Any other animal besides an insect? Snakes/rodents/sea creatures are fair game but insects freak me out! :

Edit: Fixed it up! 




 [Here you go! That was fun!](http://i.imgur.com/vskGW4o.png) 




 Digital sketches for your viewing pleasure. [Here is an example of my art.](http://imgur.com/JTkhM6m)

**Update:** hey all, gonna take a little break for a bit but I promise I'll come back and work on some more art :) 




 Thank you! 
Your username reminds me of an old children's book I used to have called "All Right Vegemite!" :) 




 came here to say this. It's too perfect! 




 Just made a ton of flash cards and have been taking notes and making sure I'm pronouncing things right (like Cynar for example). 

As far as customer service goes, I have that in the bag and I know I'll kill it in that department; I just need to make sure I don't fuck up my drinks!

I am going into the bar before they open today to do a little practice. I'll report back after. Thanks a bunch! 




 Awesome advice, thank you!!! 




 The bar is more upscale than that, which is why I'm intimidated...

 Thank you! This is a great help!

Also, how do bartenders usually memorize so many drinks? Do you normally study it when first starting out or did a lot of it come with practice?  




 Great job! 




 This comes off more creepy and stalkerish than awesome. I feel bad for celebrities sometimes. Cool photo either way, OP. Workaholics is great... Maybe next time take a mental picture when you're in a situation like that? 




 So, I just started a new job as a hostess at a local restaurant and not even a week in I was asked if I would be interested in cocktail waitressing. I have server experience and a really great analytical memory, so I enthusiastically agreed... Cut to yesterday, I show up for my shift and was pulled aside from the (lead?) bartender and asked if I was interested in bartending. I was honest about my lack of experience which he seemed fine with (he said he prefers training new bartenders over acclimating existing bartenders with attitudes). I am heading in on Sunday to do a little training and I'm extremely nervous. I've been in myriad positions where I've had to learn on the fly, and the staff seems to really like me here but I can't help but feel like they're insane for asking me two weeks into my new job.  
  

Any help or advice on how to kick ass and learn fast would be appreciated, along with any useful tips that any new bartender should know. There's a possibility this is just a trial run and won't end up with an actual bar position, but I want to be prepared for all possible outcomes.  
  


**TL;DR:** I was asked if I wanted to be a bartender with no previous bartending experience because my managers think I am organized and a fast learner (I presume). Please help with tips/opinions in any way!  
  

Thanks for reading :) 




 Seriously, you have helped me get through SO many shitty days at my horrible job. I put a post-it on my desk that says "You didn't get mauled by a bear. You can get through this day!!!"

As much as that sounds like a back handed compliment, I read your whole thread and your attitude and just overall sense of fight has seriously been such an incredible inspiration. Thanks for coming back to check in!!! :D 




 Gotta love their michelada's, too! 




 I think it used to be Deep Ellum, but it has changed... It's still good, but not the best. Redbones has a damn fine Bloody as well as The Haven.... I need to try Eastcoast Grill, that sounds glorious.

Also, I make a mean bloody and it's really quite easy! You should try making your own! 




 I lived in Miami for a little while... You aren't going to come even close to Miami Cuban... You're better off not even trying. El Oriental de Cuba is great, but it's a far cry from Miami Cuban....  




 Seriously, I'm so thankful I'm not that frump anymore... Still have body dysmorphic disorder from being picked on so much but I guess that makes me humble??? 




 Thank you :) 




 Who? Which girl? I guess I could google search but... 




 Christ, I thought I was SO COOL with that thing. Ugh, haha. Pretty sure I got it as Macy's. So punxxxxx  




 Sweet! Give her a high five for me! We are a strange mix! :) 




 Haha no offense taken. I was greasy and awkward... It was also taken in a shitty mall photo booth with my best friend at the time... It had a banner that said **ANGEL'S** or something pathetic like that, too. I'd probably be offended if I still looked like that, haha... 




 My father is Yemenite Israeli, my mother is a second generation Irish American. 




 My really pretty fucking ugly what? 




 Haha, thanks for the vote of confidence, Leigh! 




 Heh. I do what I can... :3
