 I was looking for something else and I just found a story about a real life Lassie (except not a collie rough):
http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/i-shouldnt-be-alive/videos/dog-saves-injured-owner.htm
 




 :) I really really want one. I live in a small apartment but hopefully I can move out soon into a house and get one. We also had a cat we got at the same time and they were best friends. My cat used to curl up in the dog's fur and sleep. I have a better photo somewhere - I can't find it at the moment - but I love this one of them playing together: http://i.imgur.com/EG6J8.jpg.
...though my cat doesn't really look too happy about this game hehe. 




 It was 12 years ago now and thinking about him made me shed a tear. He was ours from when I was a toddler and he was a puppy. Collies are such loving and loyal dogs. I went through some difficult years too and somehow he always made me feel so much better and less alone. I always felt like he knew how I was feeling and just wanted to make everything ok. You're lucky to have him. I wish dogs lived longer.  




 My dog looked almost the same. I miss him so much. He was my best friend for so long. He used to let me cry on him and hug him when I was sad. 




 It might be 40 degrees on occasion in January but usually it's not that hot - check out the weather charts. You'll be here 8 months too so will get cooler in Winter to something like what it is now.

I live near Annandale and $200 is cheap. Start looking now (just to get an idea) on www.domain.com.au for rental places. You can use the ipad app to search around UNSW if you want to. It's pretty good. 




 I got the flu and had similar symptoms. My muscles were really achey and my skin hurt to touch. I was really exhausted but couldn't get comfortable or sleep properly, waking up several times in the night. I was a bit restless. I think I also got a cold while I had the flu, and got really phlegmy. I got a really bad cough and it wouldn't go away. After two weeks of this, and occasionally coughing so hard I threw up a few times, I got some antibiotics. They helped a bit but it didn't just disappear. I got sick in around June and feel about 95% of my healthy self. Cough is still slightly lingering though. I think I just need more sleep. 









 When you do find your own place you will probably need a car to go buy stuff for it. There are a couple of carshare companies (e.g. goget) running in Sydney around the city areas, so this is handy. You can use them to pick up furniture from Ikea at Tempe or Rhodes if that is your thing. It's also handy if you want to get out of the city for the weekend. I have a friend who moved here from Sweden and he is using them as he only needs a car occasionally and he said it is quite good. 









 I went there in April this year. I hadn't been since I was a kid. I copied some photos for you here: http://imgur.com/a/vOeL5.

The turquoise lake is just outside the entrance Jenolan caves and is a really short round trip walk (takes about 15 minutes if you walk slow). 

Just a quick couple of notes. You need a whole day down there, and you should do a cave tour. Inside the caves it is cold so take a warm jacket and good walking shoes. The road is one way down the bottom where they allow inbound traffic only for about an hour or so of the day to allow buses to get down there. 

Oh and go early - especially on long weekends - tickets to some of the more popular tours book out early so you will have to wait around for your tour if that happens. I think you can buy them online (not sure?) which is probably the best idea if available. 




 I think it is great that you are having a positive influence on your daughters life. I don't think religion is as bad as many people make it out to be, although often people stop challenging the system of beliefs put forward by their faith, and that is the most worrying. 

I agree with BlackdogLao that teaching philosophy also is a good idea. When I studied it at uni, everyone had their own input, from all different religious and non-religious backgrounds. Nobody was wrong, but nobody was right, because most philosophical issues are not that clear cut. For example, questions like "You are on a beach and there are 2 people drowning. You can only save one. One is a young person about 21 with their whole life ahead of them. One is your grandfather who may only have a few years left to live. Who should you save?". Some systems of belief teach you that you should save the person with more years to live, but of course most people will want to save their grandfather. 

I am glad you have her interests at heart and it seems you are trying to provide her with a good education. When she gets older she can make her own mind up.  




 You know you can get a door wedge for that? 




 I think entitlement is one of the things that can really tear siblings apart when their parents get old. 

I would prefer my parents teach me how to manage the money that I have/make, than just give me things which I did not earn. That said, a helping hand is good on occasions for the right things.  




 When I was really young we stayed at a motel where they put dishwashing liquid into a glass next to the coffee and tea. I thought it was a welcome refreshment and I drank it. I wish I became a human bubble gun, but I just felt really sick. 




 Not worth it for a lifetime of ridicule. 




 That's spectacular. Makes me want to go there.

 Hobbits would have been good. I wish I saw a show about Hobbits. 




 It looks like Sylvania Waters from the heli shot. 




 Being from the Shire I watched this show only to see what it was. I thought it might be good for a laugh but it wasn't entertaining in the slightest - none of the characters intrigued me, and there was no life story which I wanted to follow. I really don't care what happens to them. I wanted to stab myself in the eyes with a ballpoint pen. I could never put myself through another episode.  




 I'm from Australia. I didn't know it was called bell pepper in a lot of other places until today. :) 









 hehehe cute cat :) He/she has getting in the box down pat, just not the getting out part :P  




 I am currently suffering in really cold air conditioning and searched for topics about air con :P 




 It depends what climate you live in. I went to North Queensland with 95% humidity and 35degC heat, and went on a snorkelling tour where I got heatstroke. And since the water was 26degC it wasn't even cooling at all. I had to go hang out in the shopping center because it was the only place I could get cool in the aircon. 

But being back in Sydney I could easily go without air conditioning. And I actually I find it to be too cold most of the time, especially since every part of the office seems to get different amounts of cold. I also find it circulates all the sicknesses throughout the office and that tends to be worse when it's cold air than hot air.

In the end especially in shared spaces, I would rather have neither. I would miss heating a little bit, and I would miss air con a little bit, but only at the mid-winter and mid-summer days of the year. The rest of the time I'm fine, and since everyone has different preferences for hot/cold it's hard to make everyone happy. At least if nature sets the temperature we save on energy costs/waste. 




 I'm in Shanghai. My flight was actually due out tomorrow (Sat 7th Aug) night but it looks like it will most likely be delayed. I have never been through a Cyclone/Typhoon/Hurricane. I'm in a 12 storey apartment building. I know the basics, like fill the bathtubs with water, get drinking water, non-refrigerated types of food, batteries, torch and radio. 

I'm not sure if I should go to the airport or not - I plan to try to clarify closer to the flight time, but I want to ring in the morning because they will probably be flooded with calls tomorrow afternoon.

I'm expecting lots of rain, power outages and closed shops. 

Is there anything else I should do to prepare/be aware of?  




 I would be interested in the answer to this. More the un-homelessing part.

 Depends if you want to go on a weekday or weekend and what time, and I don't know your price range but I just thought of a couple of places I've been off the top of my head you could look up in the cbd:

* Max Brenners near Wynyard station
* GPO cafe (not sure of the name) - There's 2 inside
* La Guillotine behind Town Hall (actually a restaurant)
* Lime Cafe
* Boy Charlton Poolside Cafe (http://www.poolsidecafe.com.au/cafe/home/) - good on a nice day

 I did this a lot after I got a new fridge. I kept misjudging how far out the door came and my toes would get jammed under the door between the door and floor as I opened it. I think if it got the big toe it would've stopped the door from opening, so I'd have to be in the perfect little toe stubbing position for the fridge to cause any damage... and it happened a lot.  




 I don't know much about bullying or what to do about it but this site seems to have some good advice:

 I wish I had a maths teacher like you. I also wish I was a better maths student in High School. I used to play up a bit cause I didn't understand some of the concepts so to entertain myself I did other things in class. I should have just asked for help.

The gap from High School maths to Uni maths was huge for me. It wasn't actually that I couldn't do it, but that I didn't know what I missed in High School that I needed to know to learn what I was learning at uni (if that makes sense). I got my friends to tell me and I was fine. And after getting past that hurdle I actually really enjoyed Integral Calculus at uni. Second year maths was much more fun that first year maths. I now do a lot of applied maths and I love applied maths even more. 




 Yum 




 Wow great explanation. 




 I'd like to understand why you prefer Australia to be a UK colony?  




 Unless he is the Queen and he holds the highest rank. Then it works.  




 The UK National Anthem "God save the Queen" seems somewhat similar to the US Pledge of Allegiance in its intent.

Australia still has "God save the Queen" as it's Royal Anthem (which I actually only just found out cause nobody here uses it really, I think it's just reserved for royal visits which happen once in a blue moon). Though it was replaced as the National Anthem in 1984. I'm not sure I like the one we have at the moment either. I wish Australia didn't have someone else's Queen. We have for the most part nothing to do with the UK. Unfortunately the referendum in 1999 shows a majority (around 60% of Australia) still want the monarchy. Doesn't help that the white Australia Policy was only abolished in 1973 and official Anti-Discrimination laws only came into place in 1975, so many of the older generation have British roots. I think we just have to wait for those who like the monarchy to pass on. 

Some people want to move forward, but a lot of people like to have a firm hold on the past. 




 That's awesome. I have a genuine respect for EeePCs. Especially how good value for money they are. It did everything I expected and more, and the build quality was excellent.

As long as you back up the data then even if you break it after being a bit rough (which I generally am with things), you can get a new one for cheap. Not that it will break that easily though...

I'd recommend checking out the new EeePC's too.  




 Prouds is okay. Better on sale. 




 What did you do to it? 

Do you put it into sleep/hibernate while you move it around? Cause if not that's not too good for most hdds. 

I have an Asus EeePC 1000H. I literally dropped it down the stairs (in sleep mode) and it's still working 2 years after the incident. 

If you're really rough maybe you should consider a Toughbook or at least get a laptop with a ssd. 

 




 It's his brother from another mother! 




 Thanks :) Sucks a few little sections are missing in a few key spots in the video, but I have a better understanding now. 




 Also dowels are a key ingredient for making meth. 




 This is pretty cool, though I wish you could have the option of continuing to display the images after changing the text. 




 He did say really fast train, though the train in his picture is not very aerodynamic. And also it's powered by steam... possibly magic steam. 




 That sucks. Are electricity prices up for you too? I get a quarterly bill and my electricity cost is double what it was for the same quarter last year. I think I've used a bit more electricity but I don't think I've used double.  




 I like pictures with movement and personality! Kinda reminds me of a [galah](http://www.mariannedepierres.com/wp-content/uploads/galah.jpg) but not pink. 




 The first argument brought up at least 5 times in this article point to women only being after money. Sure, there may be some women like that but there are also plenty that are not. 

The second main argument is that women want to crush their husbands hopes and dreams. Seriously? Firstly it's not going to be deliberate in most cases - you wouldn't marry someone with the intention of making them unhappy. Secondly, we all have decisions to make and being in a relationship means considering their wife and kids. Just like for a wife, being in that relationship means considering their husband and kids. If you aren't willing to make those compromises then yes, you shouldn't be in a relationship regardless of whether you are a man or a woman. However there is so much to gain from a loving relationship, so you have to decide what's more important to you.

The third thing I take issue with is that the poster implies that he shouldn't need to pay child support. Maybe sometimes the amounts are unfair, and if that is the case I see the point, but why shouldn't both parents be equally involved in the upbringing of their kids? 

If you really have this hatred for marriage then maybe it is best you don't marry. I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone that resented me. 




 I was wondering how you would remove these things, and thought this was relevant:

http://www.cyber-nook.com/water/Solutions.html

Maybe if you combine a certain types of filters with boiling it would be fine (or maybe you can just use a filter - not too sure). 

As that site says, depends where you live and what type of contaminants are in your water.  




 Maybe if she stands on a chair it would work. 




 I was wondering though, if you were in Johannesburg would you be safe carrying that type of equipment around? Would people still take that risk? I feel like you could just get mugged at any time there. 




 I liked the video. 




 He looks like he just ate a whole business of flies! So full! 




 The CBD is okay but a bit more expensive not only in terms of rent, but groceries, bars/drinks. Of course it is probably more convenient if that is where you are going to be working. 

In Glebe you don't have to get the tram, and personally I wouldn't unless you need to be in the city in a hurry and work along one of the tram stops (because it's expensive and it doesn't go right down into the more central parts of the city like Town Hall/Wynyard). The buses are a bit slow   busy during peak hour though I will admit - especially if you are catching the ones that go up Glebe Point Road. I think if you work in the city from Glebe, walking or biking is probably the best option (  cheapest). You can walk straight through Pyrmont and be in the city in around 30-40 mins (approx 3-4km walking). The bus is fine for most other times (rainy/cold/dark days) and taxis are usually $20 if you have a night out and miss the last bus. 

Some of the other areas suggested are good too though, but it depends on what you're after exactly. 




 Not to say it doesn't happen - but I've never heard of anyone getting typing strain (that I know). Is there anyone here who has?

I find my problem is not that I can't type fast enough but that I can type faster than I can think... stupid brain! 




 I go in the shower and blow my nose into my hands and then wash it off. I find the hot steamy water loosens it up so it comes out freely.  




 Tilt your head to the right and look at it. 




 It can! Apparently!

 Me too! My mum used to be a typist on a typewriter for the railways. Does your mum press the buttons real hard and deliberately? I saw another lady on a public computer in the shops once and she typed like my mum and I think she might have been a typist too!  




 Yeah it's always hard because even if they don't intend to hurt you they sometimes do because, well, they're people. And it's often people you are close to as well that hurt you the most because they're the ones whose words and actions you care about. :( *Hugs* 

The result won't always be the same though. It sounds like it turned out badly this time, but it won't always be that way. You actually sound like a really strong person in that you are clearly trying hard and you have overcome a lot of things to get to the point you're at. It might be good to lower your expectations a little, take things a little slower, and of course give yourself a break if you need it, but don't give up on what you want. You will get there. 




 Your comment reminded me of [this](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=depressions-evolutionary) article.  




 Did something happen today? 

It sounds like you're trying really hard to make your life better - don't give up. It's a difficult thing to do but you can do it. 




 I like the ones that are slapped on haphazardly. Goes with their parking style. 




 Yeah I'd go for lazy as well. He probably should have put in a little bit of effort thinking up a better excuse though. 




 Lol yeah, on the way to the zoo I saw some rednecks and thought we were already there. 




 It was for a conference. It was a pretty strange place to go for my first trip there but I didn't mind it! The zoo there is pretty good for a little place in the middle of nowhere. 




 I met another Australian on a plane once while I was there who did it. He said his experience involved a bunch of kids whose parents have too much money, neglect them and want to send them away for the summer. He was saying he didn't really like it that much. But I'm sure there are people who experience it differently. 




 I'd like to see an American do this on a world map. 




 That's true about that. I used to think I'd like the technology there, cause when I was in primary school I had a friend who went there and she told me all about how everything was automatic. But when I got there none of that really impressed me, but I was incredibly impressed with the Grand Canyon. I was also impressed with Niagara Falls, tho I would have been more impressed if I could feel my extremities. 




 I didn't know it was about the politicians! Actually I didn't even know it was called the windy city until I was coming down for landing in the plane and it was really turbulent. That's when the guy next to me told me about it being the windy city. Felt like it made sense at the time.  




 My first destination in the US was Omaha!  




 Thanks! That is awesome. I didn't know about old versions of magazines on Google Books.

Also look at page 168. Made me laugh.  




 I managed to dig up some information that shows people are trying to do something to help those who have been attacked:
http://www.newser.com/story/35103/pakistani-salon-hires-fire-acid-attack-victims.html
 Pakistani women disfigured by acid and fire attacks have found a second lifeas beauticians, the AP reports. The head of a well-known Pakistani salon chain discovered 5 years ago how commonly women are maimed by crazed or spurned lovers. With the aid of an Italian surgical nonprofit, she has helped many heal and put them to work.

Yet victims outnumber the jobs: 33 Pakistani women were singed by acid attacks and another 45 set on fire last year.


(On a side note, it's good they can work, but wouldn't working in a beauty salon be pretty depressing for them?)
 

And to prevent future attacks in Pakistan:
http://www.ethicsinaction.asia/archive/2010-ethics-in-action/vol.-4-no.-1-february-2010/acid-attacks-a-serious-concern-in-pakistan
 On 26 January 2010, a bill regarding acid violencewhich would specifically target acid related crimes by providing graver punishments for the attackers and by regulating the sale and purchase of acidwill be submitted to the National Assembly of Pakistan. But this only marks the beginning of a long legislative process and it will require some time before the law is successfully adopted and effectively enforced. It will also require a strong political will, which until now, has proven inadequate, if not nonexistent. Indeed, in most of those cases, the judicial institutions have not taken stern sanctions against the perpetrators, which have often been able to walk away in total impunity. Nor has adequate compensation and support been granted to the victims.


And there are new proposed laws in some other countries like Cambodia:
http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2010021632077/National-news/acid-attacks-could-earn-life-in-prison.html
 AUTHORITIES will explore legislating stiff new punishments for perpetrators of acid crimes as part of measures aimed at quelling an apparent jump in reported incidents of the violent attacks, officials said Monday.

The proposal, issued earlier this month after a string of acid attacks, is among options being evaluated by a new government committee charged with decreasing acid attacks by controlling its use.
 
 Ouk Kimlek, secretary of state at the Ministry of Interior and deputy director of the committee, said authorities will discuss parts of a draft 20-point law during a meeting Thursday, including life sentences for those convicted in the most severe attacks.

In drafting the law, the important point that I noted is punishment on people who use acid against someone to make them become handicapped, damage their beauty, or kill, Ouk Kimlek said. They will be sentenced to jail for their whole lives. If the victim is just lightly injured, then there will be a sentence of five or more years in jail.


I guess there is a long way to go still though, and even with current laws there are so many other obstacles to getting someone convicted for their crimes, and even more difficult to stop them from happening in the first place. But I am glad to see people are trying to do something.


 




 There is one outside Broadway shopping center just down from Oportos (on Parramatta Road side towards the city) that I go to that is reasonable (I think like $30 for a womens haircut - not sure how much for a guys but I have seen men there whenever I'm there getting their hair cut too). If you're looking for it you will notice it's got mostly asian women staff. Or you can try Just Cuts in Broadway shopping center - that one is not too bad.

I went to some others in the shops and they were okay (I think $60) but one of them did a head massage, and personally I don't like it because it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. 




 That is quite a walk. I have been taking my lunch and walking to work and I actually feel a sense of achievement by not spending anything unnecessary, but it does sometimes make me a bit tired. 




 So many women must feel like they have no options without being allowed to have an education. And those in the article who had the courage to make their own choices are more than severely punished for doing so. I wonder what sort of life they will live after an acid attack when an education is not allowed. What sort of job they will get to support themselves. I also didn't realise the number of women this was inflicted upon. I had heard of it before but thought it was rare. Very sad. 




 I think I am the same like that. I like 'testing' out ideas, but actually implementing them and going into that sort of detail doesn't really interest me either.

I like art too and I've always found it easy to come up with good ideas, but my technique sucks. In high school I came up with this idea and I went about painting it. One of my friends who is reknowned for copying other people's ideas did it as well. Only she painted it way better than me, and I will be the first to admit that. My idea was there but my skills aren't up to scratch. It might just be a matter of practice and finding time to do it. I went to Tasmania a couple of years ago and went for a bushwalk and noticed heaps of guys in the bush painting. It looked really enjoyable and relaxing, and I thought maybe one day I will do that.  




 What makes you tick, where do you want to be, what makes you happy at work, leisure or at other times?

At work I like to discover new things or create something new and see what I find. I like improving things. 

My home time is much the same. For example, when I had time I liked gardening cause I could be creative and pick what I wanted to do with the space and then make it happen and the results looked nice. I like creating new things too and trying new things, though I don't always finish what I start if I find something better to do.

My leisure time ideally involves being around trees or water or getting involved in nature-based activities like surfing or snowboarding, and I love that it's always different and I find it really relaxing. Oh I guess I like sports generally that involve some kind of challenge, not like jogging straight but a team sport is good. 




 I actually socialise a lot with different groups of people, but if I make too many plans I can feel myself screaming inside wanting to have my own time to be alone doing things that I enjoy. It's not that I don't like people. I just also like my freedom, and when I am around people I have to be considerate of them, and can't just always do whatever I want. 




 I like constructive criticism but encouragement would easily work better on me. That said, I think that's the same for most people. 




 Generally I have poor focus but once I am interested in something I have excellent focus (particularly at the last minute).

I found my lack of focus a problem in lectures at uni until I started trying to think of questions to ask for everything. I'd try to answer them in my head or look them up and if I couldn't find the answer I'd ask the lecturer. It helped keep my mind a bit more engaged. This applies to everything now. I don't have too many problems focusing. 




 I'm an analyst programmer too! But only for the last 2 years. Before that I did research. I preferred the amount of control I had over my work before compared to what I have now. 

I can't accept things for the way they are and go about my daily business, I have to always be improving things and making things better. I like researching about something, learning about new things, and putting my own ideas into things and testing them. I am hoping I've picked the right career but I can't think of anything else I could be doing right now anyway.
 









 I do sometimes, and then I lick it! 




 A) I agree. I don't mind pressing the flush button as long as I don't have to press the tap or door handles when exiting the bathroom. I appreciate a sink with a foot pedal like in Italy, or a sensor. 

C) We don't have many of those self-flushing toilets in Australia, but I didn't like them when I was in the US because I kept trying to do a poo and while I am a novice at self flushing toilets, the sensor kept thinking I wasn't there and flushing while I was pooing, splashing my bum which was gross. I didn't like that :( Is there a way to stop them from flushing against your will? 




 I am a fully grown adult and I want that book now. 




 I guess the intended meaning of the idiom is that 'it's not fair to judge apples and oranges by the same criteria', rather than it being impossible. Therefore I think that the idiom 'you can't compare apples and oranges' to be a bit vague and misleading, because you *can* compare them, on a variety of properties such as price, taste and color for example, even though, as you pointed out, it may not be fair to do so. 

Nevertheless, we do it all the time with everything. We have to in order to differentiate between things and make decisions. 

Ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_and_oranges

On a related note, I think that when you make a statement about your taste in art you can acceptably say 'I prefer this artist over the other artist' but you cannot definitively say that 'This artist is better than the other artist' because you are in a way suggesting that everyone feels the same way. Whether an artwork is 'better' to you really depends on how that artist has satisfied your taste preferences, which may not be the same as someone elses. So to be specific you would have to say 'According to my criteria for preference of art, this artist is better than the other artist'... or something like that anyway... 




 Why can't I compare apples and oranges? 




 Eat healthy food and try to get enough sleep. I was repeatedly sick for ages and didn't know how much difference a good diet and enough rest could make until I did it. Difference is huge.  




 I don't think I could stand just working for the future. I want to enjoy my life along the way. 









 I have been feeling this way too recently. Sometimes I find it really hard, and for a while I make progress but then there's moments where I feel like I just got reeled back to where I started. You just have to have faith that things will get better, even if you can't see that sometimes.

For now, it might not feel so great but just give yourself time, don't worry about how long it's taking, just let up on yourself a bit. This is how I have been trying to cope.

Firstly, stop worrying about the distant future so much. Concentrate on today, and making every day count. Think - what can you do today that will make you feel better? What is a positive step you can make to make the next week/month more bearable? (just to be clear I don't mean drugs or alcohol)

Next, I don't know if this works for everyone but I always give myself some time to grieve, say like 5-15 minutes or sometimes longer, whatever it takes to feel like enough. The, after I have sulked I force myself to move on and do something else. No use sulking for hours. You have to let it out but you also have to realise sometimes you're just going overboard. 

Third, don't look at other people and compare yourself. Everyone leads a different life. A lot of my friends got married quite young and I am still not. I don't see myself as a lesser person, I just chose to spend a lot more time at university and so I'm just not at that stage yet. I don't really care what they do, my life isn't about what they do, it's about me. It's up to you if you want to hang out with them but if it's making you feel worse maybe you can set yourself a time limit for seeing them so you can cope with it better. 

Finally, think about what you want in life. Start with short term goals. Things that will make you feel a bit better today, tomorrow, this week. Then when you feel like you can cope day to day, think about the rest of the month, then the next year. See how you go with that. 

As for the girl, every time you think about her force yourself to think of something else that you like instead. She has obviously moved on and you need to as well. It's not going to help you to think about it all the time.

Everything takes time, but if you spend so much time sulking and feeling crap it will be hard for you to make progress and for things to feel/get better. These things might not make you feel better straight away but keep trying and hopefully every day things will get just a little bit easier.

 




 :( Hug?
