 No, it isn't. The paint almost always crack and look terrible. Buy some [Angelus Shoe Paint] (http://angelusdirect.com/collections/paint) if you want to paint your shoes. 




 Dooope 




 I mean I vote for the Toro Bravos, but that's just me. 




 A personal favourite of mine is [GreatsBrand] (https://www.greats.com/). 




 Amen. 




 Dude, just rock what you like. It shouldn't really matter of what others think. Wear what you like. 




 HesKicks made these and called them the Kyrie 1 iD "Mag", after the Air Mag. Then, when All-Stars came around and the All-Star colourways were being released, they released something [very similar] (http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTI5WDk0MA==/z/7j8AAOSweW5U31tN/$_35.JPG) to these.

 Not to big on the SL Loop Moc's, but it's a dope shot either way fam. 




 *upvotes furiously* 




 I currently have to watch CNN Student News every other day, and take notes on it. I know this is a subreddit literally titled "CNNsucks", but I just want to know your thoughts on this. 




 Where I live Publix is a good place to find a job. 




 Some [Vans Authentic] (http://www.vans.com/shop/canvas-authentic-black) would probably be good. They're only around $50 and come in just about every fucking color in the rainbow.

Or [Converse] (http://www.converse.com/regular/chuck-taylor-classic-colors/MP_51.html), cause you can never go wrong with some Chucks. 




 Not too big a fan of the NB logo on the tongue, but they dope. 




 I personally don't see the appeal in Visvim. 









 In my opinion, no. But, wear what you like man. 




 It's *Donnie's* shit, btw. 




 First heard about this theory [here] (http://www.djbooth.net/index/news/entry/2015-04-06-chance-the-rapper-new-album).

I mean it makes a good bit of sense I guess but I don't think that much logic is behind it. 




 I think Donnie said it in an [interview] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfNVDoX3e1g) on some radio show in LA with Chance

Edit: Power 106 is in New York, not LA. I apologize. 




 This has to do with the switch from the Julian calender to the Gregorian calender. January and Fabuary I think weren't in the Julian and then inserted into the Gregorian, thus pushing October two months ahead.

Edit: I am wrong. 




 Probably brains more suited to handle Math and Statistics. 




 God, not dog.
