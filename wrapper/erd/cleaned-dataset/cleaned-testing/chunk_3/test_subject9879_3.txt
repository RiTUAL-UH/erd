 Try Laphroaig - the smokiness is so delicious. 




 Yes - if the papers that will ultimately become your chapters are already complete. 




 Some faculty are a bit unprofessional like that. Do you work with some professor, or have a mentor faculty?
Tell them to talk to her. And yes, four months delay is unacceptable. 




 The author - a professor at BU's business school surveyed 100 employees of a management consulting firm. She found that the first group, which worked 80 hours weekly were highly praised and got the best promotions. The second group, who were vocal about maintaining a work-life balance were in fact punished come promotion time, and got negative reviews. What's interesting is the third group, who worked much lesser hours, but bluffed about their working hours to keep up the illusion of a 80 hour workweek faced no repercussions at all. In fact, they were as highly praised and as often promoted as the first group, even though they worked far lesser hours. 




 Corollary: What are everyone's opinions about the [online MS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/)? 




 Same here. Courses reward conscientiousness, not knowledge or understanding. Even most grad courses do that too. As somewhat who is perpetually chasing deadlines, and is overworked the conscientiousness I have to spare for courses is way too limited. 




 Coincidence: I discovered (*torrented*) this series in 2013, and watched it all at one go in December 22, 2013. I know that date so well because as soon as I finished part 1, I was so impressed by one man that I had to Google him: [Victor Sarianidi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Sarianidi).

Imagine my shock when I find out that Sarianidi passed away that day, just a few hours back. 
Even more amazing was the absolute uncorruptibility of Sarianidi, who first discovered and later the Afghan museum curators who later protected with their own life the [Bactrian gold.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillya_Tepe) 




 Every single interaction I had with someone from Pakistan IRL has been overwhelmingly positive. While I was in Boston, there used to a Pakistani-owned pizza place a block from my house which was my thek every evening.
Online is however a completely different story however. defence.pk fluctuates between being great and being terrible (it right now is in the terrible phase). However, in my experience a lot of it has to do with moderation. Horus, for example, over at defence.pk is the administrator, and is the primary reason for the mess over there. 




 Actually not that much - and every country tries this subtle racism. American tourists are also well known boors in Thailand, Mexico and South America. 
I have been to Mexico during what was a lean season, and while sipping some beers with the owner of a mostly empty restaurant heard that he hated American spring breakers with a passion. They will trash the place consistently every year.
Similarly Chinese tourists are often ridiculed in USA. A
As I said, it is a subtle form of racism - and we Indians should learn to recognize it. 









 I recently found out that over the last year, the most texts I have exchanged with anybody was my adviser. What was scary is how far she was ahead of anybody else. 




 True story - for an essay I recently wrote I took five hours to write it down, and seven hours to make it pretty in LaTex. 
Even though, I can now proudly say that I have learned how to make wrapfig and equations play nice with each other. 




 Even in the 21st century we still have to ask about acknowledging significant others?
Come on, we are grad student - not grad androids. 




 Maybe - and while it may sound racist to paint Asians as such, I have some rejoinders - American academia is often very different from Asian academia, and adjustment can often be difficult. Two - most Asian kids in top US schools come from much more competitive schools back home. Someone who comes in from Tsinghua or IIT had to be really work hard to come to USA - and so their outlook and attitudes are often much different. 
And three, in my limited observations, most students open up and interact better through the years (though some don't, and those who don't uniformly are from a very monoculture group where the PI, postdocs and the PhD students are all from the country, and sometimes even the same university).
 Ultimately does this matter? I will argue it does - a lot. Grad school is inherently lonely and often frustrating. You do not succeed alone though - and a great department atmosphere actually helps. The same reason that it is imperative for our schools and workplaces to be more diverse, is the same reason grad schools, and even research groups should try to be more diverse.
I am an Asian international student myself - and I am not trying to be racist here - but trying to argue for a more diverse, collaborative and inclusive research experience. 




 If you have a lot of time - try learning Beamer. Beamer's native presentation styles are hideous - but because of the flexibility, one day you may go ahead and create the [the most beautiful presentation I have ever seen](http://pyprop.googlecode.com/files/disputas.pdf)
