 Hi there,

Sounds like you're definitely experiencing some anxiety in your situation, perhaps a bit of depression aswell. I'm not a professional though so don't take my word on that.

It sounds like you're going through a really difficult situation right now and I'm not surprised that you're having these feelings - in fact it's probably quite a normal response. The problem seems to be that these feelings of anxiety aren't serving their purpose of motivating you, and have got so severe that they're having a negative impact on your life.

I imagine you haven't had any previous input from professionals as you mention that you've not felt like this before, but there are plenty of techniques you can use to help combat these feelings ranging from the professional route to the self-help route.

Perhaps the first thing you should consider is meditation, you'll be amazed at how quickly this can make you feel physically calmer (within minutes!) and there are loads of online guides that will help you get started. It's very difficult at first but it will at least be a first step of making you aware of how busy your mind is and hopefully help you identify the negative thoughts that are making you feel this way.

I hope this is a helpful starting point and please message me if I can help in any way! 




 I find they're really helpful. All of the unpleasant feelings that you have at the moment are based on what is going to happen in the future. If you practice meditation or mindfulness you can start to focus yourself to be in the moment, and speaking from experience this is a huge release. It helps you release that at any moment you can get away for these horrible feelings if you need to.

Do you have a smart phone? There's an app I could recommend, if not I can have a quick look for some online sources 




 Okay well that's a good start. TV is great at taking you out of the moment and helping you focus on other things. Have you considered trying meditation or mindfulness at all? 




 Being a person is the hardest thing you'll ever do, I've been in some pretty dark places, but it's also the best thing.

First things first, have you tried any coping mechanisms already? 




 I know that feeling, it's nice to stay in a comfortable, safe place after experiencing anxiety for a while. I think that doing this will only serve to increase your anxiety in the long run though. 

You've got to keep pushing yourself to leave that comfort zone and you'll get back to normal soon enough. Try and force yourself to go to the gym today, PM me when you've done it to keep yourself accountable :)

You're not alone with these feelings and they're definitely possible to overcome! 




 I don't know about dangerous mental illnesses, but I know that a lot of Psychology students suffer from mental health problems. Who's best motivated to raise awareness and treat people with mental illness? The one's who suffer from it.

 Looks more like two hippocampi. 




 He actually openly asks for people to heckle him, comebacks are what he does best.

 Where are you Joe? 




 To anyone about to watch this, don't be put off by the title and watch it all the way through. 




 I have a horrible feeling this is a cropped scene from The Walking Dead. 




 Brothers, sisters, thank you for showing me the whey 

Although I am but a few steps down the iron path, it has been well trodden by those who have worshipped before me. I have seen that whilst the path is treacherous, all those that walk it with devotion in their hearts are rewarded.

Today I gazed into the mirror and with great joy saw my first blessing - I beheld not a boy, but a man!

Now all that remains is to visit my temple and give thanks. 

Let them lift weight - Brodin willed it, and it was done. 




 Alas, you have paid the price for being tempted by Broki. But fear not, although the path may now be somewhat longer, it is laid out before you still.

One step at a time brother. Make us proud. 




 Couldn't agree more, everybody is more worried about how they look themselves! 




 Hmm, kinda funny looking. 




 I'd probably grab a fistful of poop from the toilet and fling it at them, if that doesn't work I don't know what will!
