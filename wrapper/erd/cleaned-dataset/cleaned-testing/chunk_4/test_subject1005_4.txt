 Yeah, the neighborhood chick that Buck diddles with the pool cue.  




 I never worked in a video store, but when I was a kid, I was obsessed with Heather Graham. I used to banter with the guys who worked there who told me she was in the movie "The Great Outdoors." I knew he was wrong, so I bet him she wasn't in it. I'd give him five bucks if she was or get the movie "Pay Back" starring Mel Gibson on VHS for free if she wasn't. I got to take "Pay Back" home with me that day. That's the extent of my Blockbuster stories.  




 Tell some stories about your days! Things that got on your nerves, interesting movie requests, celebrity sightings (and what they rented obviously) and so on!  




 I know I can't prove this, but I use this quote at least once a week.  




 ROBOT, RIP HIS ARMS AND LEGS OFF! *you can basically quote this entire movie in yells and capital letters and nobody will hassle you for it* 




 YOU BETRAYED THE LAW 




 Shut your bucket.  




 He looks like T-Bag from Prison Break.  




 You should ask if you can swap your 15 minute break for a free pass to slap a customer instead.  




 At least you're raising your children right! Never give up, never surrender!  




 I think Scary Movie fails because its Scary Movie haha Off topic here, but I think they got better when the Wayan's brothers weren't involved.  




 Don't open that! Is there air? You don't know! 




 I agree, its satirical without being slapstick. Not an easy venture as so many movies (like you mentioned Scary Movie series) go for the cheap laughs.  




 I seriously love this movie to death, but I always considered it just a guilty pleasure- the assumption being no one else really likes it too much. Turns out everyone I know loves this movie too. What does Reddit think? 




 Listen, I hate to defend Adam Sandler, but shut up.  




 Is that what you call complaining about "gay jokes?" lol  




 No. You're just a liberal baby. Your post screams "I'm uncomfortable by gay jokes."  




 Get over yourself and your idiotic desire to make all things PC. So tired of you liberal babies bitching over what hurts your sensitive feelings.  




 I said you're a cry baby 




 One of the dumbest assessments I have ever seen. Cry baby. 









 Django is American too.... 




 Ah see, Paint it Black always makes me think of Full Metal Jacket. But then so does Surfin Bird. I was gonna say Wooly Bully too, but that song actually makes me think of Happy Gilmore.  




 Yeah, and wow that was such a perfect song for that scene. You just can't hear it nowadays without getting psyched up.  




 What're your classic 'you hear a song, you think of the movie' songs? I can't hear Somebody to Love and not immediately think of the Cable Guy.  




 You smoke weed? That's awesome!!!!! 




 It is all about that East Valley :) Gilbert for the win! 




 Doesn't sound too bad. I'll try to stay awake.  




 Armageddon is hated by most because of the scientific inaccuracies. I'll take the experts' word for it, but it doesn't change the fact that it has great lines, great characters and a fun plot. It is not my favorite movie, but if you start complaining about the accuracy of this movie's elements, then you might as well discredit every movie because I'm sure you can find a bullshit in every single one.
