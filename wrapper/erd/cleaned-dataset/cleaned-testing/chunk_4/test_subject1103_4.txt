 It's the deprivation of comments that irk me. Not allowing me to do something, goes against my dogma, ergo, I do not like your presentation with extreme prejudice.  




 As a man of science, I can not support suppression of communication in an ill or unintentional matter. It's highly unreasonable.  




 Youtube disabled comments? Automatic Down thumb. 




 How many licks does it take to suck dry a thick lolipop  




 If it makes you feel better, all the eyes are on the blonde.  




 Spotlight effect, done. Next question. Maiestro. 




 For me I use my ears to learn and eyes. If I can see it and hear it, I repeated it two things and see it again and hear it. I remember it. Now my fetish is Japanese women, and I'm saving money or coaxing a good friend of mine to make a recording of all the vocabulary, short diagrams, or just formulas
 And beat off to it while listening to it. Ever since I done this my GPA increased dramatically. also ask me about American History from 100BC to Rosevelt, I know pretty much everything.  




 iphone5? That's junk. Insulting to see anybody profit from such errors  




 As well as their Moms!

Please post link to post if so.

 Which color should I get? 




 Ah, innocence. Welcome to the world of Fuck You. 




 Do you sell your kidneys?  I'm looking to buy one 




 how does it work?   




 pics would be nice.  




 Not that good 




 You might start memories a menu and get into a habit of, :would you like a coke with that?:

 Wait I'm  the only one? 




 You may see college as a financial hole and time but it's worth it. You learn so much. You become more prone to stupid shit non educated people would fall into. Unless you're already have an alternative to enrich your life, then by all means work from online. But it's best to have a back up plan? ex. I'm going for therapist (Love this job) but I'm always taking the TESLO/CBEST so I can teach if needed. But if your plans don't require pursuing education then it's not for everyone.  




 Sounds like a gwaker case to me. Join a click or support group,  sports is a real good one. And let this become your life. Considering you already failed courses, speak to your counselor and see if summer school is  avaliable.  




 Posts like these remind me that common sense, isn't so common. 




 Yes, I'll like today's special. Thank you, no ice please.  




 Ah, I just this seat yesterday, Advice from a veteran is this: Just the necessities.  




 You have to kill all those people who want violence. Violence dariwsm.  




 Who bought your organs? Xhou  orinjkua Kay? Are you selling any livers by any chance? 




 Lesson learn: Never ask for help.  




 I'm speaking to the advisors for a successful transfer next school year.  I'm a sophomore now, but I need a few credits to qualify. Psychology. 




 I'm 19, and I still live with my family, albeit I did dorm for 2 quarters. If you like it, you'll get it. Is my motto. Depends on your interpersonal likes. For me, I tried waiting for the Note 5- I had a Note 2, but it broke- I bought a temp. phone (lumia630) fucking phone sucked! I missed my note 2, so I bought a Note 4, new for $520. Regrets. My life is more better with this companion, as I use it EVERY HOUR. ( except sleep) Cheers!  




 Oh, sorry I forgot to mention it's only 90% calibrated. I have the same problem about the 5%, but it's no big deal. I just charge it for a 30 minutes, and it'll be at 50% for a few hours. Easy fix.  




 I didn't really scrutinize the battery to accurately say, but from conjecture. I did this. Did not charge the battery full when it first arrived- I didn't have time. The future is now- battery was 50% right off the bat. Then I let it drain from that day on, by itself. Once it drained I let it charge over night to 100% (while off) then I turned it on, following that I did the same thing again. By the 4-6th day the battery was give or take calibrated. Although, it's not 100%, more like 90%. My phone stays on 1% for about 2-4 hours, which sucks because the screen turns lowest brightness and I can't use the camera, damn you Sansumg for being so conservative...  




 Twice. Don't stress about it too much though. A watched boiling bot never boils ;p  




 Drain that baby down to 0% Let it turn off, by itself. then charge it until it says, "100%". Did that with my 10,000mah one. 




 There is a product that will make your life more blissful. [Zero Lemon Case](http://www.amazon.com/Warranty-Zerolemon-10000mah-Extended-Protection/dp/B00Q7C6FTA) Will make your life ridiculously easy. I charge my phone every 2 days. I use it heavily, as I am always on Pandora or just using it for school/work. Buy this and you'll never scream at your mom again.  




 Depends what you like. If you suffer like me financially I'd go with the Note 4. Make scarifies in life for the things in it. E.x I don't eat at all outside, and mostly hang out with friends doing free shit, allowing me to Study Abroad in Japan for a few weeks. On the phones, usually the newer one is nicer, and better.  




 Is there any news on the release date?  




 I never buy phones from people. They could have fixed the phone with the shittest replacement parts. Looks new, but everything has been replaced with the lowest quality aspects, but this is a highly pesstemistic view. Cheers! 




 1) is definitely a nice one. But these are mostly written for stupid people, ergo, "self-help" As they cannot help themselves. But in an other life, You should take time to read A Prayer For Owen Meany, that book will Fuck You Up. Cheers! . 




 If your life sucks like mine and bought an ATnT phone, just instal icon apps on your phone, so it will look idiocentric. I just added a red sticker to the back, so if my phone is in the dark, I always put is face flat on the floor, so I see a big Ole Dot. Cheers!   




 Looks like there is 243 vacancies in the medical field. I'm going to try to snatch one.  




 You should watch Kill Nill. good movie 




 Unless  you're in the exit lane. No one passes me  *no one* 




 Amazing,  thanks for the input! 




 Thank you for your input. I haven't visited the campus yet, but I saw the website online and it has amazing features. Is there a lot of student involvement on campus? E.x clubs, third party merchants, solicitors, or just frequently updated bulletins?  At CSUSB, there is only about 4-11 active clubs on campus, compared to the "300+" they have registered. Thank you again for reading and your time!
