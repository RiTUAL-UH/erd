 Quick question: what's a "personal day"?

(From the UK - they do things different over here!) 




 I love OK Go's songs....

...but Of The Blue Colour Of The Sky has to be one of the most badly produced albums I've ever listened to. I'm no audiophile, but I actually contacted Amazon because I thought their rip was faulty! I also downloaded a torrent (bad too) and in the end, bought the CD thinking that it can't possibly sound so bad. I was wrong - it does, and I can't listen to it now.

Yes, I'm sure there are artistic reasons for it, but to my ears, it just sounded bloody awful.

Sorry guys. Love the songs, love the videos, but get someone else to produce your albums :-/ 




 As Amazon forked Android, and introduced a competing app store, they have waived all rights to use Google's own marketplace.

You make your bed, you lies in it.... 




 Not the smallest regret, not even for a minute. And I suspect others would agree here. 




 Your call and glad it suits, but please tell me your decision wasn't based on tripe like this! 




 No, not remotely like this.

My kids (7 and 5) wake at around 7am and play by themselves quite happily or come into see us. We're usually all up having breakfast by 8am (sleeping my life away doesn't suit me) and the day goes from there.

What do I do if the kids are away? The same. With possibly more sex ;-) 




 Remember, a good landing is one that you walk away from. An excellent landing is one where you can reuse the aircraft.... 




 Life finds a way. 




 With a swipe card, steal it, learn to copy signature, use it. In fact, no one I saw in the US even checked the signature anyway, so you probably don't need to bother learning it.

Steal a CnP card and you can do virtually nothing with it apart from NFC payments (low value) or online transactions (and most banks require separate passwords for these now anyway).

I haven't swiped or signed for years now. 




 And they /chose/ to do this!?

Our wedding had the people we wanted at it. About 70ish with a mix of friends and family and I guarantee you that not a single person was there because we "had to invite them". Plenty of family were missing because, well frankly, we didn't want them there.

Our day, our money, our choice :-) 




 My kids' school (UK) doesn't allow fizzy drinks, or sweets in pack lunches. Likewise they don't sell them on site. More or less unlimited fruit though.... :-)

Start kids eating well when they're young and you'll set them up for life. Stuff em with Coke all day and they'll sit on their backside and watch TV instead.

(My kids do get sweets as treats BTW. I'm not running a monetary here... No fizzy drinks though. None of us drink them so they're rarely in the house. The kids would probably prefer something else anyway.) 




 I didn't. Thanks OP. 




 I agree. I too have not found his writing particularly offensive.

As for calling for a ban on linking it here...please let us make up our own mind rather than enforce censorship. Reddit is (or should be) a democratic community. If the article is tripe, the community will downvote it into oblivion. And if it gets up voted, then the community disagrees with you. 

Don't play god. Let us decide what is good or bad. 




 Errr, chill dude. This sort of stuff happens in sport. 

Vettel has talked about Ferrari ambitions in the past, so this is hardly surprising.

What would be surprising was if it was Fred vs Seb next year. Now /that/ would be cool.... 




 I'd love to see anyone offered a P1 and then turn it down in favour of the 458. 

Sure, the 458 is a fine car, but the P1 is on a different planet! 




 Some twat in a Merc did this to me yesterday. Bastard!

Plot twist: I was in a BMW. Surely it should be me doing this sort of thing... 




 They are offensive, antisocial, class-divisive and the after-smell created by them is offensive to all in a public place.

At least the tobacco was OK. 




 The term "Bobby" originates from the early days of the police, created by then Home Secretary, Robert Peel. Originally known colloquially as "Peelers", the term "Bobby" (a short form of "Robert") is the last reminder of the origin of the British Police. 




 "A DUCK!" (*gasps*)

"Who are you that is so wise in the ways of science?"

(Watched many, many times including once in German, unsubtitled. Couldn't understand a word and it lost nothing in humour :-) 




 Where's his exercise bike? You know...the one he pedals to charge his car up.

Because if he's doing anything else then it's NOT FUCKING ZERO EMISSIONS!

Aaaaand relax :-) 




 Start any conversation with a stranger by apologising:

"Sorry to bother you, but..."
"Excuse me, can I.."
"Pardon me, but..."
"I'm very sorry to disturb you, but...."

 




 I love that he wasn't going to bother taking the black, but when he did, potted it like he was on a pub pool table.

For raw talent, the best there has ever been by a country mile. 




 You need to paint a clear picture here if you want others to understand 




 Once, perhaps. But not these days. First class rarely means next day now.

That said, for valuable goods, its hard to beat Special Delivery which really will deliver next day. Its a lot more cash though... 




 *sniffle* 




 And presumably you have no frame of reference.... 




 All fair comments, and obviously I'm a driver myself too, but really and honestly, I neither care if a driver is being wound up or not. If I don't think its safe for him to overtake, I'll make sure he won't. My life  his temper, every single time.

As a balancing comment, I've often wondered that if you stacked up arsehole drivers against arsehole motorists, who would win :-) 




 You walk everywhere and are therefore largely unimpeded by the road closures? Surely this makes you better of than most...

Why would you sigh? I'd have thought you'd be happy that such a great event was coming to your town! 




 The two abreast thing is interesting. I have my own take on this as a cyclist:

1) If I'm riding with a friend, we ride side by side
2) If a car comes up behind, we'll move over
3) If I'm riding on my own in a place where I deem it to be unsafe to be overtaken, I'll ride in the middle of the road and the car must wait until I say he can overtake. I then move in. I don't allow myself to be squeezed into the verge, and make myself as wide as I need to to prevent it.

And you know, I've had very few problems with (3). Most drivers are content to be told when it's safe to pass and I've possibly saved myself being shoved into the dirt any number of times due to "optimistic overtaking".

As evidence, I present....me! Not dead, too :-) 




 I think millions is probably more in the right area today.... 




 Amazon UK can deliver to a local pickup point (typically a fuel station or convenience store) and you can then pickup your item using ID and a confirmation code at your convenience.

Its called CollectPlus and is a marvellous system for avoiding the wait in all day blues.

FWIW, I only use it for Saturday deliveries - most stuff just goes to my office during the week. 




 I'm still astonished that anyone in the USA has patience enough to sit through the ads!

On the subject of cost, most people in the US have cable / satellite? The number is rising in the UK, but many people (strangely, more so in affluent areas) choose to only get free to air TV and for 150 vs twice that for a basic satellite service, its pretty good value. 

I'd be interested to see how much people pay in the US for a comparable service. I'd be willing to bet that 150 wouldn't go that far....
