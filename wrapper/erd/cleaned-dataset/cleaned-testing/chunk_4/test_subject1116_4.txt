 Thats a pretty cool chart by FO.   




 The big cost there is joining the military. 




 Are you sure? Didnt Gates play with a torn one a few years back? 




 I'm not too worried about the foot.  Yes it will always be in the back of my mind, but is there really a better replacement for him?  Maybe Gronk, but he is also an injury risk every time he gets onto the field.  Graham will have his snap counts limited as this is an injury that needs to be managed but it's not like he didn't perform the other weeks he was limited.  In regard to last week specifically, it looks like his limited snap count, especially in the red zone, was based on the Saints game plan not his injury.  Here is a full article on the subject matter:

 Graham with one foot is still better than every TE in the league.   




 Yea it is a 16 team league and was planning on picking Fitzpatrick and McCown to play the matchups till Rodgers came back. 




 I do think that's a trade you should make.  The drop off between Smith and Allen isn't as great as the increase going from Johnson to Charles. And carolina is still a very good defense so losing KC isnt that big of a deal. 




 I'm 8-2 and trying to set my team roster up for the playoffs (weeks 15-17).  I was wondering if I should give the Rodgers owner Luck for Rodgers and tannehill.  I really have no idea how to evaluate Rodgers for ROS value considering the timetable for his return is so muddled. 




 Vereen.  Johnson is nothing more than a Tate handcuff. 




 I understand that we shouldn't get hyped up about Johnson, he probably will get the same amount of work that Tate had with Foster in the lineup.  But Tate is injury prone, so Johnson does have value. 




 That's fair.  




 I think you may be over reacting to the Rodgers injury.  We have seen good RBs do well with bad QBs, ie Stacy, AD, Charles, etc.  Obviously it would be better to have Rodgers at QB but I trust McCarthy to come up with a good offensive game plan.  He is a good coach, he had Favre and Flynn (albeit in a small sample size) look good in his system.  Lacy's schedule is just as easy Morris'. While the redskins o-line is probably better, the packer's o-line has been pretty solid at run blocking.  

With all that being said, I view both Morris and Lacy pretty similarly.  They are probably anywhere in the 8-12 range in RB rankings.  









 You dont need Spiller to get 20 carries a game to be great.  He's efficient when he gets the ball.  And I'd rather have him not get the ball that many times since he has had injury issues throughout his college and nfl career. Also the Bills run alot of plays due to their up tempo run oriented offense, so a split with Jackson isn't anything to worry about.  Even with jackson, Spiller was getting more than 18 touches a game when he was healthy the first 4 games.
