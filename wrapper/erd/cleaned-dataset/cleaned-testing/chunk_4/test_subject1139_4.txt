 I also always liked the [imagery](http://www.reddit.com/r/Mushishi/comments/27977b/mushishi_episode_6_cinematography/) in Mushishi. 




 This felt like a mix between Harmonie and Chihayafuru. 




 That's most likely right. Ship sunk. 




 Aww, Daichi's lady friend has his jersey number as a key-chain. 




 I guess it could be argued that Machida should've turned it up earlier but I think the reason he was able to gain momentum was because Weidman started to fade in the 4th and couldn't apply the same amount of pressure. 




 That was endearing. I like how Naru's behavior put to light Handa's flaws to himself -- too prideful to apologize and too enclosed in his comfort zone.

Hopefully this turns out well since I've been itching for a SOL about an adult and they're rare to come by. 




 I'm pretty hyped about the super-duper awesome genius prodigies matching up against each other. 




 In this episode: exposition

Is this suppose to be a bad thing? Or do we really want things happening without a proper set-up and build-up a la Captain Earth.

I think the exposition was delivered well either through the flow of character interactions or background dialogue (radio). 




 Prior to the Royals there were the 2006 Diamondbacks with Justin Upton, Stephen Drew, Conor Jackson, Carlos Quentin, Carlos Gonzalez and Chris Young. Quentin and Gonzalez were used to get Haren. Their pitching prospects aren't worth mentioning hence the Haren trade.

2007 and 2011 were the only good years they had. D-backs and Royals show how fickle talent development could be. Even the Rays took years to figure it out. 









 It's freakin excellent. My AOTY last year and will go down as one of my all time favorites. I'm glad that this will give it a bit more exposure. 




 Crunchyroll webplayer definitely needs some work.

The PS3 app was absolutely horrendous a few months ago but after an update it has been fine. 




 Looks fine to me too. Better animation, better camera work, better effects.

 The OST is ace. [My favorite track.](http://youtu.be/1QR6LJuv6sc)

Also an underrated anime. The 1st season took a while to find its stride but the 2nd season was great and more than makes up for it. It had some of the most emotionally charged fight scenes I've seen. Also well choreographed and animated.
 




 They made four seasons of Natsume Book of Friends. 




 To me episode 18 was the turning point of the show. It turned from a funny show to a "I laughed so hard that my sides hurt" type of show. 




 I thought this might be Mushishi's version of a nature documentary but instead it's just Ginko getting swindled lol. I loved the folklore vibe of the whole episode.

Also Ginko walking around in circles reminded of episode 14, when he got lost in the bamboo forest. That episode was really sad.

[Episode 9](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/06/mushishi-zoku-shou-episode-9.html)

 




 I feel there's been too many practice episodes. Some good, some just okay but it does get a bit monotonous. I think a change of scenery and activity while maintaining the volleyball-centric story would be a good palette cleanser. 




 Near the end of the last episode there was a short scene of Kaori sitting in the dark and her diary on her desk without anything new written on it. I thought that was ominous but it seems despite her set-back and all the negative memories coming back, Kaori is still bravely pushing forward. But now Hase...we need intervention! 




  Hase's just overthinking it as per usual

I think that's quite the opposite. He usually follow his emotions impulsively (with both negative and positive results). Right now he's feeling scared, so his instinctive response is to avoid the situation. If he actually thought things through he would've arrived to a logical conclusion that it's best for Kaori's recovery for them to stay "special" friends.  




 Rory seems like a nice guy and all but Rogan's constant verbal fellatio of him is really irritating and makes me want to see him get knocked out by Hendricks.

 I think I will upvote anything Gintama related. 




 So Sidonia did not encounter a Gauna for a hundred years. Then Nagate surfaces and almost right away a Gauna shows up.

The Captain predicted that the Council would want Nagate dead so she purposely navigated Sidonia into Gauna territory so she can sortie him and somewhat appease the Council. Although not ideal, this situation fits her strategy of defeating the Gauna instead of running away, with Nagate as her ace just like the way she pictured Hiroki should have been. This is also why she doesn't give a shit about the Kabi's attracting Gaunas.

Also I'm speculating Ochiai threw away the Kabis in order to force the Council to use his Gauna-Human hybrid as a weapon since it can kill Gaunas without a Kabi. 




 I'm more curious if the anime would boost the manga sales. It's a bit concerning that the older volumes didn't make the top 50 in the last few weeks of rankings. Unless they're not available.

 Those people need to experience cramping up. I don't care how mentally tough you are, you're not gonna will your body to move when cramps have immobilized it. 









 This episode has a such a gloomy feel to it. The same sort of melancholic feeling I get when I watch 5 cm per second.

Hase gets clean up duty. His crepe date then goes to hell. He loses special friends status. Fujimiya seems to have stopped writing in her diary. The street light then forebodingly flickers off on Hase. All of these happened in a span of one day.

Being Hase truly is suffering. 




 Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor. The second season exists, just accept it!


 




 The way Shaft used the song was underwhelming.

The story about Ayano and the orphans, the story of the Monster, the Snake's schemes and how Kano fits in all of this were awkwardly put together. There was no flow whatsoever.

I was hoping for a jigsaw puzzle story that would cleverly put the pieces together but with only three episodes left I would not get my hopes up that the show can pull that off. 
 




 The Captain's super secret facility needs to be more secretive.

I really like the sequence where as Tanikaze becomes a bigger hero so does his obsession with Guana Hoshijiro. The sliding glass barriers was a nice touch. This is a really well directed show. Hopefully, Kobun Shizuno gets more quality material to work with in the future.
 




 Nice character development. Been waiting for something like this, hopefully the show would build on it. The show is fun but a little bit of depth doesn't hurt.

Short supply of magic fuel seems like a sign of rationing for war. That's a nice touch and adds to the world building. 









 Watch the remake, Space Battleship Yamato 2199. It's amazing. 




 [Knights of Sidonia](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/05/knights-of-sidonia-episode-8.html). 




 First volume sold almost 6,000 in its first week. I was hoping for more but it actually still out-performed the [projected sales](http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1 hl=en ie=UTF8 nv=1 rurl=www.google.com sl=ja tl=en u=http://www27392u.sakura.ne.jp/show.cgi%3Fn%3DB00J2GGZ5C usg=ALkJrhgoECCiZRNruKB_hdEHEg-cIKnjvQ) based on the Amazon Ranking Stalker. The projected sales for the later volumes are higher but I dunno how accurate that is. 




 I think all the action scenes which there are plenty of, and some of the more important non-action scenes are animated at full 24 fps or done "on ones." The rest of the non-action stuff I think are done on twos with maybe the exception of the earlier episodes which are noticeably choppier. 




 [I think this epitomizes Hase's feelings at the end of this episode.](http://gfycat.com/HighRashClingfish) 




 The show is really pushing it with the teasing and the bait   switch romance. It's giving me Touch flashbacks. I should be bothered by it but the show is so damn heartwarming that the gimmick just comes off as amusing. 




 It's just part of the process, a painful one.

 [Ping Pong The Animation Episode 8 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/05/ping-pong-animation-8.html) 




 AoT animation was even more inconsistent than KoS. The first half of that show was littered with stills and some of them out of context to the dialogue. There were even [unfinished](http://media.animevice.com/uploads/1/13547/659701-2hmdkci.jpg) portions and the studio [apologized](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-05-09/attack-on-titan-staff-apologizes-for-unfinished-episodes-on-3-stations) for some of them.

Also, in general, anime shows are animated in low framerates. We're talking about 8-12 fps or sometimes lower. KoS isn't really any worse than any anime in terms of FPS, it just looks more jarring when applied to CG. Just imagine any Pixar movie rendered at 8 fps and it would look more noticeable than most animes.

KoS's frame rate has gotten better though and action always looked fluid. 




 Only ones I know that were clear about couples having sex:

**NANA.** Also much of the romance centers around adults who are already in a relationship. It's great and much different than most romance animes, I highly recommend it.

**Otona Joshi no Anime Time.** Four different stories about four different women. It deals with adults so the themes are mature; single working woman, unhappy marriages, and dysfunctional family. 

**ef: a tale of memories.** Teen romance with the common anime trait of characters unable to commit. The characters are well written though.

There's also White Album 2 and Clannad. 




 "My only regret is that I have...LeBronitis"

-Lance Stephenson  




 Eh? I'm just making a general statement on the /a/ topic and not comparing the two communities. 




 ITT: couples who need to just fuck already

That's almost every anime with any sort of romance. 









 Emiru died because the admonition infection has spread. She was infected because of her deep feeling of despair and resentment. 














 I for one want Lance Stephenson to keep on talking. This is entertaining. 




 [Manga](/s "I didn't quite rage but it was definitely frustrating. I just hope there's a development in the characters that would justify hitting the reset button. I'm also wary of a possible love triangle involving Hajime. I wouldn't mind using him to push Hase in the right direction but I don't want a drama built around a love triangle") 




 Dammit Hase just admit to yourself that you like her. I guess Shogo is going to have to coax it out of him, like always.

This episode set things up so well, much better than the manga. [Manga Spoiler](/s "What happens next is really going to hurt. It would also really frustrate some people since with only four episodes left we most likely won't see a payoff that would justify such a huge setback")

 




 Hinata's energy gets me hyped up. I really like how most of the characters play off of that energy or just with each other in general.

This episode did sports speeches really well. Those speeches a lot of the time feel obligatory and contrived just like they did in Episode 4. In this episode they felt really natural and flowed with the story and dialogue. 

Also the OST if amazing.

[This sequence at end was great](http://imgur.com/a/3JNtj). 




 Stephenson is averaging almost 44 min/game. The guy is being run ragged. 




 Tatsuya being ludicrously OP and amazing at everything is weirdly entertaining and amusing. 




 The nightmares that Shintaro seems to be having are the intros in Episode 1 and 5, the ones with him and Ayano talking.

Also we finally get a connection between the "Monster" and the rest of the cast. The teacher, who's also Ayano's father seems to be involved also. Maybe they're the family?

Eternity seems to be a theme here. The monster is immortal, Ene woke up in a body that's practically immortal, Haruka seems to have been granted an immortal body and Ayano seems to exists in a time and space where she's eternal. 




 I love the use of rain as an analogue for her tears. The parallel between the drifter mushi and Teru's life was also an elegant analogy. Mushishi really excels at these type of things.

There's some awkward editing in this episode though. The way the flashbacks were done was a bit jarring. 









 We finally get the overall picture of the show which is to rebuild in the Rem star system but the Captain thinks it's not that simple. Looks like the political/social turmoil will get fleshed out more with the departing ceremony. 

Man, the cinematography and editing in this show is absolutely top notch. It even managed to make the death scene look beautiful.

[Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/aoeFH)

 




 In the flashback in Episode 2 when as a kid Smile said he wanted to be like Peco, I don't think he meant in terms of skill and talent. I don't think he saw him as a hero in that way either. I think for him, to be like Peco is to love and enjoy Ping Pong. Smile probably did enjoy Ping Pong but as he watched Peco's passion for the sport fade way so did his enjoyment along with it.

What I think Smile is playing for and chasing after is that enjoyment for the sport that he used to share with Peco. 




 They're missing out. The attention to detail in terms of background art, hud displays, UI displays, the wear and tear on equipments and suits is superb. The cinematography, editing, music, sound effects, the action and just the overall direction has been excellent and not just for an anime but in general. 




 Eh. You're missing out, I love the murder mystery vibe of Mononoke. 




 This episode was hilarious. I totally did not expect this show to pull off something like this. I'm a bit lukewarm to Akira and Toru but some more comedy would really add some much needed charisma to these characters. 














 The animation in the last scene when Tina, Enju and Kisara were hugging was silky smooth. As opposed to the action scenes which were mainly made up of cut in-cut aways, quick match cuts and close ups in order to hide limited animation.

A cute scene featuring lolisaction scenes. This show knows its priorities. 









 Spoilers, obviously.

 Agreed on Heito and the mad scientist. The whole hysterically evil act is so tired. They really bring down the show, which is unfortunate since the rest of it have improved since episode two.

If you really like the aspect of a supernatural being born out of despair and tragedy then you should really watch the Mononoke tv series (unrelated to the Ghibli movie). 




 [Manga spoiler](/s "Five episodes should be more than enough to cover at least up to chapter 16. Although, I doubt five episodes is enough to resolve that arc. So Season 1 most likely won't have a closure but with good execution it could still feel satisfying albeit with some uncertainty.")

[](/s "I just really hope they don't go the route of using filler episodes and then use Chapter 14 as a cliff hanger ending. The would really suck.")

[](/s "As for the memory loss, yeah that hurt but it was more so frustrating. The relationship between the two was progressing so well despite Hase's wishy-washiness being slightly irritating, then all of sudden we're back to square one. At least Hase seems be showing good growth out of it, with the way he's handling things so far")
 




 Aww! They didn't do Fujiyama's internal monologue during the study scene that was in the manga. I guess it makes sense in terms of pacing the characters, and also consistency since most of the anime is told in Hase's perspective. But still, I really liked that moment. 




 The chemistry between Hinata, Kageyama and Tanaka is great. Their interactions remind me of Ippo, Takmura, Aoki and Kimura. 




 The 256 Gardes dissolve formation sequence looked great. The memorial scene was well shot too. 

[Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/CSSGs) 




 I think the surprise more has to do with how it was executed. The flash forward was so unexpected that it might have caught people off guard which made the death reveal shocking despite the deathflags.

 Kawaii. 




 Both teams played hard. 




 The drama has somewhat been more nuanced in the last two episodes which is a big improvement but it also made the wacko character types like the Scientist and Heito stick out like a sore thumb. I wish those characters didn't exist, since they're off setting any consistency that could be established.

 You should build him a Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon to show your appreciation. 














 I clicked on the link expecting Kondo. Slightly disappointed that it wasn't him. Only slightly because boobs. 




 That was...that was actually kind of good. The episode did a good job of making the characters intriguing, I feel like this is how the show should've started instead of bombarding the audience with too many dramatics. I'm still not getting my hopes up but this will keep me watching. 




 The sweetness of this show is turning me into molasses. 




 That was a nice and laid back team building episode.

I also like that the show rarely resorts to character stills with just moving mouths during dialogues. There's always little body language animation the makes the characters feel alive.  




 I'm curious about how this show will tie everything together. This could end up a disjointed mess or a unique and cleverly told story. Either way this is a type of show that requires patience and the audience to let things unravel instead of expecting the storyline to be laid out in every episode.

Hopefully the saying "The whole is greater than the sum of the parts" rings true for this show. 




 Mahouka sure tries hard to make the anti-discrimination Course 2 students look like extremists. Fuck them not being happy with discrimination, amirite?

There's a difference between institutionalized discrimination and personal bigotry. They seemed to be fighting against the latter when the former is far more important. The former could be changed with progressive policies while the latter can't.

Obviously bigotry is not OK but like Mayumi said you can't change what an individual feels by force.  









 I guess those Gardes are worth more than civilian lives and structural damage. As cold as it sounds it kind of makes sense since they're the only line of defense and must be used as a last resort. Even just losing 1/8 of their Gardes would be a huge blow and that's with very little guarantee that the Guana won't get through. So if the option to evade is there then it's probably the best option most of the time.

Still pretty ballsy and quick risk assessment by the Captain.

I didn't expect to experience such an intense space battle so soon after Yamato 2199. What a great surprise.

Also gotta love the detail and design on those graphic displays, UI, and flight instruments. It's the little things that create the space sci-fi atmosphere. 




 The dark tone in this episode is so contrived; the blood licking, the random murderous character, and the mystery mecha inexplicably located in a hospital basement. Still, I'm morbidly curious about this show so I'll keep watching. 




 Don't worry they'll go back to not caring about basketball once they're eliminated. 




 Bullshit double tech. It's just the refs making up for the missed foul on Val. 




 Too many monologues and speeches crammed into one episode which undermined Sugawara's characterization. I feel like that was an excessive amount of set-up just to initiate the chemistry between Kageyama and Hinata. 




 At first I was worried about the jealousy angle but the episode fortunately didn't dwell on it and merely used it as a cause of conflict. And the dialogue was good enough that it came off as a natural reaction from a young man who's in love. Although, I still would've preferred if the show used something less cliche and convenient.

I also really liked how vague they are about the diary during the riverside conversation. It expresses how unsure they are on how to handle the situation but both know how important it is to them. I think that really made the resolution all the more gratifying. 




 The moment the fingers make contact with the eyes it should be called a poke, the ref shouldn't wait for the opponent to get hurt. I mean, they don't ignore a low blow shot even if it didn't affect the fighter, same logic should be applied here. 




 You forgot to add that they're a bunch of screwdrivers playing Monster Hunter. It always amazes how Sorachi comes up with these crazy ideas and make them work. 




 Even one cour shows need 2-3 episodes to set things up. 

I'm finding this "plot development in 3 episodes or bust" mentality among some anime fans to be silly. It's an initial approach that promotes needless impatience and an entitlement for instant gratification. 




 And now we have a big breasted Christmas cake character. This show is just hitting all the otaku-bait staples.

I love the high-brow stuff like Mushishi and Ping Pong and the more subtle drama like One Week Friends but sometimes I just like to sit back and enjoy wacky shows like this one. 




 These muggles are so salty. 




 The pacing seems fine for a 26 episode season. First three episodes set up the characters, magical setting, student council and the awkward take on discrimination. This episode introduced the possible conflict with the anti-magic terrorist group, it's pretty obvious that's where the plot is going. 




 So many good passes are wasted on Asik. 




 DeRozan got the 2006 Finals Wade treatment. 




 This episode gave me a "The Most Dangerous Game" vibe and a little bit of "The Birds" vibe towards the end. Good stuff. 




 CG also allows the animators to have more freedom with the camera work since the camera is operating in 3d. In 2d they redraw all the different angles which is a lot more work. The amount of camera angles, transitions, and different POVs that we saw in this show's action scenes are something you're rarely going to see in 2d animation.

Also I really like the lighting and shadowing in this show, again something hard to pull off in traditional animation.

Hopefully CG in anime keeps improving, variety is a good thing. 




 I actually want to see Kunato try to pilot the Type 17 and possibly make a fool of himself. According to that little bit of exposition the Type 17 demands more from the pilot since the computer system isn't as advanced. 




 The framerate is up and down. 1st episode I thought it was ok, 2nd episode it was really distracting and 3rd episode it's ok-ish. Overall I think the show looks great.

I didn't expect all of them to die. Even though someone dying was predictable I thought it was executed well. The voices of panic and everyone's composure unraveling were pretty convincing. 




 He doesn't have to commit and it might remain that way but I'm just pointing it out that it's a weakness.

Throwing a game is disrespectful to the opponent since it belittles their effort and pride. I highly doubt Kong would appreciate being pitied like that. 




 Tsukimoto's strong sympathy for his opponents is a big weakness but equally so is his view of ping pong as something inconsequential to him. Even if he can become a stonecold player there's really not much that drives him to win, after all this is just a hobby to him. Once he meets his match talentwise he wouldn't have as much resolve as someone who loves the sport, committed to excellence and have a strong will to win.

Weirdly enough Tsukimoto reminds me of Nodame (a pianist) from Nodame Cantabile. Both are talented at their craft but for differing reasons they have trouble committing to it and seeing it as more than a hobby. 




 I really wish this didn't go the amnesia route. We already have a series with the same "mysterious powerful girl" setup that uses amnesia as a plot device.

The interaction between the three is starting to grow on me and inserting some world building gives the show a sense of adventure. 




 Why the fuck is there a case of mass destruction inside a Gastrea?

Also, some of these scenes are put together well with decent enough dialogue but the overacted voice acting spoil these scenes. The screaming and wailing can be a bit grating which is a shame since I like how the show is building up the bond between Rentaro and Enju. 




 Grizz had to beat both the Thunder and Lady Luck 




 Yeah, a bit heavy handed with the character emotions and motives. It's going with the old "angsty MC with a tragic past" concept; nothing wrong with that but the portrayal was way too straightforward and unrefined. Despite all of that, I didn't mind the first episode, it was effective in establishing the dark tone albeit a bit forceful, and it did enough to piqued my interest.

Hopefully the drama doesn't get too overbearing and the show would let it breath. I haven't seen much of Okada's work but she's been criticized for overdone melodrama, so I'm crossing my fingers here. I really really liked Anohana though, melodrama aside. 









 I know anime fans love to complain about MCs in romance shows being wish-washy and beating around the bush but this one is quite the opposite. The relationship feels rushed and unearned, and lacks chemistry. The show hasn't done enough with the dialogue and circumstances to build a feeling of genuine bond between the two. 




 Werdum really turned it on after Browne taunted him. Then Werdum proceeded to taunt Browne for three rounds. 




 Gotta commend Tatsuya for his composure when Miyuki was working her "charms." If I were in his place...ummm I might start questioning my moral values lol.

This has all the makings of a fun guilty pleasure show; overpowered MC, imouto fetishism, nonsense jargon, awkward take on discrimination, and good action. 




 Finally a three. 




 Andersen you idiot. 




 I love Eagle, WTF am I doing watching the ESPN broadcast.
